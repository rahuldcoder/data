@entity1 , @entity0 -- when it comes to making movies , @entity3 would appear to have it all			1
@entity8 's latest film " @entity3 " starring @entity9 and @entity10 is the first identifiably @entity3 blockbuster			1
a huge landmass with a location for every movie eventuality , from the post-apocalyptic desert seen in " @entity16 " to sophisticated central @entity17 through @entity19 's lens in " mission : @entity21 " compared with , say , the @entity23 , it 's a relatively cheap place to film			1
by filming sci - fi blockbuster " @entity26 " in @entity17 , the @entity24 were able to keep their budget down to $ 60 million			0
making the same film in the @entity23 would have cost three times as much , they say			0
and then there 's the talent			2
directors like @entity33 ( " @entity38 , " " @entity39 " ) and @entity8 ( " @entity40 , " " @entity41 ! " ) and stars including @entity35 and @entity9 all hail from @entity37			0
over the years , the @entity3 film industry has produced groundbreaking and remarkable movies like " shine , " " @entity46 " and more recently " @entity47 " that have burst out of the domestic movie market and made a splash internationally			1
but breakout successes like these are few and far between			0
despite the industry producing quality films since the 70s , it has failed to build its accomplishments into a sustainable domestic film market			1
some of the problem is down to size			0
@entity3 may be big but its population is tiny , coming in at a little over 21 million -- just twice the number of people living in the city of @entity64 , @entity65 alone			1
this has meant limited government funding for the film industry and over the last five years , an average of just $ 20 million ( @entity3 ) ( $ 19 million ) has been raised each year from private investors			1
so for domestic flicks there just is n't much money to go around -- average budgets are between $ 4 - 8 million ( @entity3 ) ( $ 3.8 - 7.6 million )			1
although there are exceptions , low budgets mean @entity3 filmmakers have struggled to come up with the kind of slick productions that make it to international distribution			1
" boutique " is the euphemistic phrase bandied around to describe the country 's industry , but @entity86 , ceo of @entity87 ( @entity87 ) , the government - backed film funding body , is more frank : " i would term [ it ] a cottage industry in that it is very hand to mouth for most filmmakers			1
we are limited with the kind of stories we can tell , " he told @entity2 over the phone from @entity17			0
for big budget money , @entity3 relies on attracting @entity104 movies by competing with the @entity23 on price			1
in the early 2000s , huge productions like " @entity26 " trilogy ( the first film to be shot at the @entity110 complex outside @entity17 ) and the " @entity111 " prequels were filmed over a number of years			0
while this was positive for the industry in terms of creating work , it has n't succeed in putting identifiably @entity3 movies with bigger budgets onto the world stage			1
more recently , big @entity104 bucks have dried up as the drop in value of the dollar has created incentives to stay at home			0
but in the last two years , there have been some fundamental changes in the backing for films that give cause for hope in the industry			1
one of @entity3 's most famous film exports , director @entity8 's latest film , " @entity3 " is at the heart of the changes			1
starring two of @entity3 's best - known @entity104 diaspora -- @entity9 and @entity10 -- it is billed as a sweeping @entity143 action - adventure romance			1
it is the story of an @entity0 rose who inherits a cattle station and then has to enter into a pact with a stockman to prevent her property from being taken over			0
with an estimated budget of $ 130 million , it is the most expensive film in the country 's history			0
and it is the first @entity3 epic			1
" the importance of that film is enormous			0
it 's the first blockbuster that 's identifiably @entity3 , " @entity157 , head of the media division of @entity17 - based lawyers @entity160 told @entity161			1
it 's not just the size of the film or its subject matter			0
while preparing to shoot , the kitsch - loving filmmaker was instrumental in lobbying the @entity3 government to introduce a new incentive scheme that gives filmmakers a 40 percent rebate on the budget of their film			2
this effectively allows @entity110 , the @entity104 studio behind " @entity3 , " to take back over a third of the film 's total budget			2
the government and film officials hope that this new offset could be the catalyst for a turnaround in the industry 's fortunes , increasing the production value of @entity3 films from around $ 600 million ( @entity3 ) ( $ 576 million ) a year to $ 1 billion ( @entity3 ) ( $ 960 million ) over the next few years			1
" we 've made ' @entity188 ' and ' @entity16 ' and in the 90s we did ' @entity46 ' and ' @entity40 ' ... we need to be doing more of that , so what we 're hoping with the offset is that we can move back up to doing 30 or 40 films a year			2
when you 're only making 20 films a year it 's hard to have any success , " @entity86 explained to @entity2			2
foreign investment into @entity3 companies is being encouraged by testing productions for " @entity3 - ness			2
" to be eligible for the full 40 percent rebate , productions must pass a check that covers the film 's subject matter , where it was made and the nationalities of the producer and director amongst others			0
this way , the government hopes to start building the sustainable industry that has eluded them so far			0
@entity3 digital production company @entity212 , the brains behind the 2007 hit " @entity214 , " is producing the latest film to benefit from the new rebate			2
animated feature " @entity218 , " which is projected to come out in 2010 , is based on the @entity23 series of children 's books by @entity222 set in the imaginary " @entity223			0
" the film 's makers say the forest is being designed to look like @entity227 and the majority of the cast is expected to be made up of @entity3 actors			2
despite the apparent @entity3 credentials , this latest offset award is causing some controversy			2
critics say the film should n't be eligible because it has been in production by @entity23 studio @entity237 since 2005			0
some @entity3 filmmakers are wary of the rebate being abused by foreign filmmakers			2
if it becomes too popular it could attract negative attention from the new money - conscious government			0
nevertheless , exporting @entity3 culture is important to many in the country 's film industry			1
@entity3 actor @entity249 , who recently starred in the @entity24 ' latest film , " @entity251 " told @entity2 : " if @entity3 [ movies ] can go well internationally and support artists at home it 's really important to the cultural identity of a place			1
" the powers that be in @entity3 cinema certainly seem to be doing as much as they can to raise the industry 's international profile and attract foreign filmmakers			1
this year , the annual @entity264 launched a brand new official film competition			0
@entity267 minister @entity266 was at @entity268 to make the announcement and told @entity2 : " part of the reason for this announcement is to make it more attractive for international producers , international films ... to say to the international film community , ' we want your business			2
' we are saying to the rest of the world , ' come to @entity17 , come to our state , make films and we will look after you			1
' " @entity86 hopes that more money will mean films with broader international appeal			0
" we need to be making more ambitious films			0
i think we will be doing films with broader audience appeal which will have a much bigger success			0
so i see more " @entity214 " happening , " he said			0
@entity296 could be awakening from its slumber .			0

@entity3 has great locations , talent and is a relatively cheap place to make films
despite movies like " shine " the domestic industry remains small and hand to mouth
recent changes in the backing for films could be the catalyst for a *resurgence*
