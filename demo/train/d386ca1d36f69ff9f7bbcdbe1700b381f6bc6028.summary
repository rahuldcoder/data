-- an @entity2 judge on thursday abruptly dismissed the murder case against a man accused in the scuba - diving death of his newlywed wife off @entity8 's coast			1
the decision from judge @entity10 came near the end of the second full week of @entity13 's trial in @entity14			1
according to @entity15 , the judge 's judicial assistant , @entity10 dismissed the case " after the state rested its case against @entity13 ( and ) the defense filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal due to a lack of evidence			1
" " i 'm going to grant the defendant 's motion for acquittal			2
this case is dismissed , " @entity10 said , prompting an outburst of applause in the courtroom			0
afterward , a visibly emotional @entity13 put his face in his hands , then began hugging people around the room			2
his 26 - year - old wife , @entity36 , died october 22 , 2003 , while the pair were diving at a historic shipwreck off the @entity39 -- some 9,000 miles from @entity14 , where the two had wed 11 days earlier			1
his father , @entity41 , called the entire situation " terrible , it 's tragic , " while expressing satisfaction with the judge 's decision			1
" i 'm just thrilled for @entity13 , and i just hope everybody can begin to heal , get their lives back together , " said @entity41 , calling his son a " good kid			1
" prosecutor @entity52 said " this case is over forever , " since there is no appeal possible			0
" i strongly disagree with him , " @entity56 said of @entity10			0
" i 'm just extremely stunned , and i 'm at a loss for words			0
" that sentiment was echoed by @entity60 , @entity36 's father , who said " we 're very disappointed " by @entity10 's decision			1
" there just seems to be a lot more protection for the accused than there does consideration for the victim , which in this case was @entity36 , " @entity60 said			2
after his wife 's death , @entity13 returned from @entity8 -- where media dubbed him " @entity73 " -- to the @entity74 and remarried five years later			1
that same year , in 2008 , he pleaded guilty in @entity8 to criminally negligent manslaughter and subsequently served 18 months in prison in that country			1
in october 2010 , an @entity2 grand jury indicted @entity13 on two counts -- murder for pecuniary gain and kidnapping where a felony occurred			1
those charges were based on the premise that @entity13 hatched the plot to kill his wife while in @entity2			1
the doctrine of double jeopardy -- which says that a person can not be tried or punished twice for the same crime -- did not apply because two separate sovereigns , a state government and a foreign government , were seeking to prosecute , said @entity95 , a @entity14 criminal defense attorney and law school professor			0
after his sentence was complete , the @entity8 government held @entity13 for a short time in immigration detention in light of its policy of not extraditing anyone who might face the death penalty			2
@entity8 authorities deported him back to the @entity74 after getting assurance from @entity74 authorities that " the death penalty would not be sought , imposed or carried out , " said @entity107 , a spokesman for the @entity8 @entity108			2
@entity13 was then arrested , in november 2010 , in @entity110			2
in the opening arguments of @entity13 's @entity74 trial earlier this month , assistant attorney general @entity111 told jurors that @entity13 had changed his story on what happened several times			1
the prosecution also alleged that @entity13 had expected to gain about $ 210,000 in insurance and death benefits due to his new wife 's death			2
" this whole case ... is about murder and gain , " @entity111 said			0
but defense attorney @entity126 said that @entity36 's father was the beneficiary on her workplace insurance policy			1
@entity13 filed for some expenses from a travel policy , but it was denied on a technicality , @entity126 said			0
his client did sue an insurance company when it denied him an accidental death benefit , the attorney said			0
" @entity13 never stood to gain anything from @entity36 's death ; he lost , " said @entity126			1
the defense argued that @entity140 was wearing too much weight with her suit when she died , and that a strong current , her relative diving inexperience and a pattern of anxiety during dives were contributing factors			2
during the trial , judge @entity10 spelled out what he believed were the basics of the prosecution 's case -- that @entity13 had schemed in @entity2 to kill his new wife			1
" the defendant buys an engagement ring			0
he gives it to his future bride			0
he plans a trip halfway around the world that 's paid for by him or his family , " @entity10 said			0
" and he did all of that , and planned it all here , so he could go over there and kill her so he could get the same engagement ring he purchased ? " after thursday 's decision , @entity126 called the entire ordeal a " nightmare for @entity13 and his family ( and ) a nightmare for @entity36 and her family			1
" " we all wanted justice , we all wanted the court to hear what little information was presented , and the judge determined that it was n't enough , " the lawyer told reporters outside the court			0
" we 're just very , very happy that @entity13 can get some closure and move on , start his life over			0
" @entity187 , a friend of @entity140 , said outside the court that she wanted the jury to decide the case and feels that the " only justice that comes is the one that @entity193 provides , and we will never be there for that day			0
" " ( @entity13 ) knows everything that happened , he knows how it went down , he knows what was involved , he knows what the intent was , he knows what the feelings were , the motives were , " she said			0
" he does n't need to have a jury tell him what happened			0
" @entity0 's @entity206 contributed to this report .			0
