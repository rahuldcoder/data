-- @entity3 gov. @entity2 's political troubles may reshape the @entity5 race much more radically than most commentators are yet predicting			1
to understand why , think of the @entity5 presidential nomination as a playoff game between two rival leagues			1
one league is composed of the @entity5 's donors and professionals			1
the other features the party 's activists and militants			1
in 2012 , @entity17 triumphed early and totally in @entity18 , and then waited patiently for the nomination as @entity20 stumbled its way through a garish series of impossible candidates			2
the only plausible player fielded by @entity20 , @entity26 gov. @entity25 , whiffled out before he had properly started the game			2
this time , though , @entity20 has attracted plausible talent			2
whatever any detractor may say about @entity30 and @entity31 , they are @entity33 senators			1
they may be unelectable to the presidency , but they are not inherently unnominatable , in the way that @entity38 and @entity39 were unnominatable			0
a better @entity20 puts new pressure on @entity18 -- at exactly the same time when @entity18 seems be sputtering in the way @entity20 sputtered four years ago			0
@entity18 's brightest prospect , @entity2 , looks likely to soon be benched by self - inflicted injuries			1
there is other talent in @entity18 , of course			0
if interested , former @entity47 gov. @entity46 could sweep @entity18 -- but almost one - third of the way through the political cycle , he has yet to indicate that he is interested			0
@entity51 gov. @entity50 has fans in @entity18 , as do @entity47 sen. @entity53 and former vice presidential nominee @entity54			2
this abundance of choice suggests that in 2016 , unlike 2012 , the @entity18 contest will extend for a long time			2
the @entity18 contenders will have months to run negative ads against each other -- and to remind @entity20 fans why they dislike each @entity18 player : @entity53 , for wishing to widen immigration ; @entity54 , for writing a budget that cut @entity65 ; @entity46 , for his last name			0
the prospect of a long and bitter battle within @entity18 -- conjoined to improvements in the seriousness and professionalism of @entity20 -- calls into question many of the usual rules of @entity5 politics			1
old rule : the winner of the @entity5 nomination this time is the guy who came second last time			1
that rule held in every open contest from @entity82 ( runner - up in 1976 ) to @entity17 ( runner - up in 2008 )			2
not this time : in 2016 , for the first time since the 1960s , there is no @entity5 heir apparent			1
old rule : the @entity89 always wins			0
from the rejection of @entity92 in 2008 all the way back to the defeat of @entity95 in 1972 , @entity90 have often preferred insurgents over leadership favorites			0
2012 spectacularly confirmed the power of the @entity99			0
but in 2016 , the rule is looking wobbly for the first time since 1964			0
old rule : electability matters most in @entity5 presidential primaries			1
tea party voters took chances in 2010 and 2012 on many oddball candidates for @entity107 and @entity108			0
they played it safe at the presidential level			0
but many will feel that the defeat of @entity113 in 2008 and @entity17 in 2012 discredit the case for the " responsible choice			0
" in 2016 , @entity5 primary voters will for the first time since @entity117 be offered a brace of seemingly plausible , irresponsible choices			1
if @entity18 looks as disorganized in 18 months as it does today , will the @entity5 's primary voters continue to refuse temptation ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity125 .			1

@entity125 : @entity2 , the leader among moderates , may not be a 2016 @entity5 contender
lack of a clear favorite may open way for @entity5 activists to pick the nominee , he says
candidates such as @entity30 and @entity31 look more plausible , @entity125 says
@entity138 : old rules about how @entity5 picks a candidate may be thrown aside
