-- in october 2011 , actor @entity1 launched a new company called @entity3			1
initially , the business offered a variety of coffees and teas , sold online and in a small cafe in the @entity10 part of @entity11			1
this week , @entity1 's expanding his line of offerings into the world of chocolate , just in time for @entity16			1
while it 's certainly commonplace for entertainment professionals to dive into other business opportunities , @entity1 's new business may seem a bit curious if viewed through the lens of his offering items tied to the little pleasures and relaxations of life			1
@entity1 seems to always be shooting a film or booking theater work			1
the guy ca n't slow down			0
@entity0 recently spoke with the actor from @entity31 about the evolution of his new business , the inspiration behind it and who in his family is helping out			1
he 's currently rehearsing for the upcoming film adaptation of " @entity39 © rables " and later this year will begin shooting " @entity43 , " reprising his role as @entity41 in the latest comic adaptation			1
@entity0 : some people claim that chocolate is an aphrodisiac			1
does your chocolate guarantee good loving ? @entity1 : that 's a good question			1
i would definitely say -- because i eat a little bit of dark chocolate every day -- i 'd definitely say that it makes you feel good			1
i do n't know if it makes me feel like " getting it on			0
" i suppose i could see the connection			0
it definitely makes you feel good			0
@entity0 : you launched @entity3 last fall			0
in the general sense , what 's the business plan ? @entity1 : laughing man worldwide is going to incubate different companies			1
one of them is coffee and tea , one of them is chocolate			1
who knows where we 'll go from there			0
each of these companies that we create , 100 % of the profits go to charities			0
it 's first and foremost about creating good products that people really want			1
not that they feel like they should want it , but because they genuinely want it			0
and then being able to create jobs and support entrepreneuralism			0
i was mainly inspired by @entity90 on the business level and what he did			1
i read his book about 10 years ago , " @entity94 in the @entity95			0
" it 's a great book and that 's probably where the idea incubated			1
@entity0 : the @entity90 line , and sorry for the pun , started very organically			1
@entity1 : that 's what inspired me , and i was waiting for the right opportunity			1
i was in @entity105 as a part of @entity107 and i met and worked with a coffee farmer , @entity109 ; at the time i was living with them , and it was pretty amazing			0
it had a great effect on me			0
so the urgency for me to do something was growing , but i did n't know what			0
now , we actually buy coffee from @entity109 where i stayed			0
our espresso blend is actually called @entity121			0
@entity0 : and everything is sourced with fair trade guidelines and all that ? @entity1 : absolutely			1
@entity126 , fairly traded , the chocolates are kosher , you name it			0
we wanted to be win - win all around			1
the environment , the growers and the purchasers			0
@entity0 : there 's a lot of political aspects surrounding food , not only in the @entity138 but on a global level			2
but there 's a market out there for people that care about that stuff			2
@entity1 : oh , yeah , hugely			1
and what 's important for us to know who we are buying from			2
there 's some organizations that you 're buying from that are like a co-op and you ca n't really guarantee who you are buying from			2
we really want to encourage people that you can get a really fair price for quality products , wherever it 's grown			2
that 's what we 're doing			2
business done well is a win - win all around			1
it does n't have to tax the environment or quality or the workers or people			0
there is a way , under the natural law , for this to work for everybody			0
@entity0 : as an actor , you 're constantly busy with work			0
how much are you involved in the day - to - day or month - to - month of this ? @entity1 : every weekend , i go down [ to the store in @entity11 ] with my son and do some work			1
i figure it 's good for him to start doing some work			2
most of the business is done online			2
i 'm involved as much as i can without it being my full - time job			2
for a long time , i 've been looking to focus my profile on and this somehow ... i 've always been interested in economics and business -- my wife always jokes that i should be taking a briefcase to work -- it 's something i genuinely enjoy and it does n't feel like a burden			1
@entity0 : you 're rehearsing " @entity39 © rables " right now			0
what 's the adaptation going to be like ? @entity1 : it 's a musical adaptation			1
obviously , it 's a 1,500 page book , but do n't worry , it 's not going to be 15 hours long			2
it 's an epic , and we 'll be musically close to the musical			2
today , i was working on a brand new song that @entity208 [ @entity209 ] wrote with @entity210 , which was a great thrill for me			0
@entity0 : what 's the sound like ? is it modern in any way ? @entity1 : oh , no , the music is largely as it is from the musical			1
so there 's no rap version or blues version			2
it 's going to be what people expect in that way			2
@entity0 : @entity225 just announced a release date for " the @entity43			0
" what 's the game plan ? @entity1 : shooting later this year			1
" @entity231 " finishes around the beginning of june so we 'll take a month down and we 'll get started			0
it 's a @entity233 saga , i 'm very excited about it			0
it 's looking good .			0
