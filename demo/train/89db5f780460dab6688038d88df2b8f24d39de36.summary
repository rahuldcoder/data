-- the shooting down of a @entity3 airliner over @entity4 may finally force @entity5 and @entity6 to wake up to the danger of the conflict there escalating into full - blown war between @entity11 and @entity4			1
this potential cataclysm has been inching closer to reality in the last week			0
the @entity4 security council has said @entity11 weapons and troops have been crossing into @entity4 , and military aircraft from both sides have engaged each other			1
documented videos purport to show artillery fire into @entity4 from the @entity11 side			1
on sunday the @entity11 media went berserk with reports of the first casualty of a @entity11 civilian on the @entity11 side , from an artillery shot of disputed origin			2
former @entity11 foreign minister @entity29 told me monday he was decidedly more pessimistic about the prospects for resolving this crisis than he was three months ago			1
as a veteran of international negotiations in 1999 on @entity35 and in 2003 on @entity36 , he was perplexed as to why the international community was not trying harder to resolve the @entity4 crisis			1
last weekend the five permanent members of the @entity40 , plus @entity41 , met with @entity42 on its nuclear issue but failed to use that opportunity to discuss @entity4 seriously			0
the @entity4 conflict urgently requires the most resolute and determined efforts to de-escalate before we reach a point no return			1
@entity5 should be focusing policy attention on strengthening @entity4 's capacity to defend its sovereignty , economically and physically ; instead it has a misplaced obsession with using economic sanctions to punish @entity11			1
the @entity57 administration and its critics on the right , such as @entity61 sen. @entity60 , contend that such sanctions will change @entity11 behavior , but there is not a shred of evidence to suggest this strategy would be effective			2
there are many reasons why a policy over-weighted on punishing @entity11 is a dubious strategy at best			0
first , the @entity11 economy was in stagnation , if not recession , with capital flying out of the country at record rates before the annexation of @entity79 in march			0
the @entity57 administration can not credibly claim its policies have made a significant difference to the @entity11 economy			0
they only allow @entity84 to blame the @entity85 for @entity11 's poor economy and deflect attention from the real culprit , his failed economic policy since returning to the presidency two years ago			1
second , @entity11 's political economy and psychology are far more suited to absorbing punishment than the @entity85			1
@entity11 companies suffering from sanctions can likely expect government subsidies to compensate their losses			2
i doubt @entity100 and @entity6 companies can expect the same			1
they will simply lose market share			0
what 's more , a thousand years of history suggests the @entity11 are by far the most effective in punishing themselves			2
finally , if @entity11 perceive their punishment is inflicted by others , it is a powerful stimulant to national consolidation and a spur to inflict unimaginable punishment on others			0
@entity84 is an archetypal traditional @entity11 leader who aspires to making a historical imprint like @entity114 and @entity115			1
this is a bloody serious game he is playing , cynical and determined beyond what flabby @entity100 and @entity6 strategic thinking can or wants to comprehend			1
he will not be deterred by sanctions			0
he has made a mockery of the @entity122 ultimatum in june that he cease and desist in @entity4 in 30 days or else			0
he has responded by sending more men and equipment across the border , with the predictable result that the " separatists " ( the so - called @entity129 is led by well - known @entity11 citizens ) actions have escalated			2
the only good news is that the @entity4 government 's military force has been extremely successful in destroying @entity134 rebel strongholds over the past month			2
and herein lies the urgency of the problem			0
the rebel cause has been close to failing , with the defense of @entity139 and @entity140 being the endgame			0
@entity84 can not allow that to happen as it could shatter his leadership position -- he will not allow it to happen , plain and simple			0
the @entity4 government has every right to defend its sovereignty against this @entity11 - instigated insurgency			1
there is no other solution but urgent diplomacy to de-escalate and to get international peacekeepers to the border region as quickly as possible			0
the stakes in allowing this war to go on are far too high to allow for anything else .			0

@entity159 : @entity161 's downing must awaken @entity100 , @entity6 to danger of @entity11 - @entity4 war
focus should be on @entity4 's ability to defend sovereignty , not @entity11 sanctions , he says
he says sanctions over @entity11 's help to rebels will help @entity84 whip up nationalism
@entity159 : diplomacy needed to de-escalate crisis ; @entity84 wo *n't* allow himself to lose face
