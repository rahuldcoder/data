-- as the mainstream tablet war rages , a similar device battle is heating up in the restaurant industry			0
tablets that take orders , entertain guests and accept check payments are coming to a table near you			1
one company that is selling those tablets , @entity10 , announced on tuesday that it has raised more than $ 1 million in funding from prominent investors like @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
the company will soon be launching tablets in 20 restaurants on the @entity18			1
it also has a partnership with a large restaurant chain in the pipeline that has n't been announced yet -- but the fact that @entity25 's executives participated in the funding round might provide a hint			0
why the interest in providing every table with their own touch - screen tablet ? for starters , people buy more food when they can do so instantly , without waiting for service			0
in the six restaurants that ran a pilot scheme , according to ceo @entity40 , customers at @entity10 tables spent 10 % to 12 % more than those at other tables			1
@entity10 tablets allow customers to browse a full menu and communicate their orders directly to the kitchen			1
they come loaded with social games and a calculator for check splits and tips			1
they also allow customers to email themselves a receipt or instantly sign up for a loyalty club			2
in high - end restaurants , the tablet can suggest an appropriate wine pairing for a meal			2
eventually , @entity10 might offer restaurants the option to compile data about their customers ' preferences as they use the device			1
some restaurants have attempted similar functionality by loading their menus onto @entity67 or asking customers to download an app onto their own devices			1
the @entity67 's problem in this situation : its minimum $ 499 price tag			0
restaurants that can afford menus that expensive are n't casual restaurants , like @entity25 's , where a digital ordering system seems more appropriate			0
asking users to download an app like @entity80 poses the problem that not everybody carries a smartphone			0
even those who do might not want to pause and download an app as they sit down to lunch			0
a dedicated device , which @entity10 plans to install for a price that is " significantly lower " than the @entity67 , seems to be a more promising way for the tech world to break into the $ 6 billion @entity93 restaurant industry			2
other companies are already in this game			0
@entity96 makes a similar tabletop product that it began to deploy in 2008			0
the company has established customers with chains like @entity101 , and @entity102 and will be in 250 stores by the end of the summer			2
both @entity10 and @entity96 charge the restaurants a monthly fee to use a network of devices			1
" it 's propelling the restaurant industry into the internet age , " @entity109 says			0

@entity10 tablets allow customers to browse a full menu and talk with the kitchen
the company will soon be launching tablets in 20 restaurants on the @entity18
