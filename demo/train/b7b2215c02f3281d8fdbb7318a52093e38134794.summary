-- one of the truly remarkable and relatively recent boosts to the health of poor women in this country has been their opportunity to get preventive , reproductive health services at little or no cost in one place			0
over the years , one @entity9 after another has been able to offer these women not only affordable contraception , but full exams that include screening for breast cancer , the no. 1 cancer killer of women			1
this week a major financial supporter of breast cancer education and services , the @entity21 for the @entity22 , announced it was ending its funding to @entity9			1
while @entity9 believes @entity21 is caving in to pressure from anti-abortion groups , @entity21 said its decision was made because the foundation is not allowed to give money to any organization under government investigation			1
an article in the @entity33 said this was a reference to " an inquiry begun by rep. @entity36 , a @entity38 @entity37 , to determine whether @entity9 uses public money to fund abortions , " an accusation @entity9 has heard before and denied repeatedly			1
when @entity21 announced it was cutting @entity9 funds , it failed to mention that it recently named @entity43 senior vice-president for policy			1
she ran unsuccessfully for governor of @entity47 on a strong anti-abortion platform and called for an end to funding for @entity9 in that state			1
another abortion foe , @entity53 , the general chairman of the anti-choice @entity54 , sits on @entity21 's @entity55			1
i have no evidence that they did or did n't participate in @entity21 's decision			1
but as ill - advised as it is -- and if comments to @entity21 's facebook page are any indication -- i suspect that the decision will not be popular with many women who previously supported the foundation			1
in fact , by mid-afternoon tuesday , the story had prompted an outpouring of financial pledges to @entity9 : $ 400,000 and rising , according to the @entity72 's @entity71			1
these supporters understand how important it is to be able to offer free or low - cost reproductive health care , especially to girls and women from low - income families in rural and medically underserved areas			0
those of us in the middle and upper income brackets ( as i suspect many , if not most , @entity21 employees and supporters are ) visit private physicians			2
we can afford , if not always easily , regular checkups and driving long distances if necessary			0
women with little income do n't have these luxuries , which is where @entity9 health centers come in			1
a clinic can be virtually a one - stop shop , where a woman might come for a pap smear , birth control pills and a breast examination all on the same visit			0
while mammograms and biopsies are referred out to other doctors at low or no costs , @entity9 physicians oversee the cases			2
women also learn in the clinics how to examine their breasts for cancer			2
without @entity9 and similar organizations , the people most in need of this care would be the least likely to get it			2
this is not the @entity113 i know			0
we 've gotten along -- one could say prospered , even -- as a country of diverse views by finessing our differences			0
you believe this , but i do n't			0
i believe something else , but you do n't buy it			0
we forge a common ground			0
i ca n't think of one organization i 've belonged to or given money to with which i agreed 100 % on every issue			0
but that has n't stopped me from supporting good work that that organization does			0
if only @entity21 operated the same way			2
