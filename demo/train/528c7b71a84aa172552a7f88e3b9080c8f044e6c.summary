-- been thinking about wrestlers			1
no , not about @entity2 or @entity3 or @entity4			2
wrestlers who wrestle for real			1
wrestlers who wo n't wrestle in the @entity11 if the @entity13 drop kicks their sport			1
it was revealed tuesday that the @entity13 is giving serious thought to the elimination of wrestling from @entity20 competition			1
he was a deputy sheriff from @entity23 , @entity24 , when i watched him in the 1984 @entity26 on the night he became the first @entity27 ever to win a medal in @entity18			2
" knowing me , " he said , " i 'll probably have it bronzed			2
" been thinking about @entity34			2
wrestling may be cut from @entity20 he was a high school and college wrestling champion from @entity38 , @entity39 , who was 29 when he finally made it to an @entity20			1
he went to @entity41 in 2004			2
he dedicated it to his older brother @entity43 , a former wrestler who died of heart failure right outside @entity34 's house in 2003			2
@entity34 did his best but did not win a medal			2
" i do n't care			2
it was still worth it , " he told me			0
" every long , hard minute from day 1			0
" been thinking about @entity51			0
she -- yes , she -- is a wrestler			0
a mere 4 feet , 11 inches tall			0
( women 's wrestling became an @entity20 sport in 2004			1
) @entity55 was a kindergarten teacher from @entity56 , the daughter of a @entity59 - @entity27 mom and a @entity61 - @entity27 dad			0
she defeated a seven - time national champion in the @entity27 trials in 2008			0
then she went to the @entity64 and got herself a bronze medal			0
also been thinking a little bigger			0
been thinking about @entity66 , of course			0
he bulked up to 475 pounds before @entity70 's " @entity69 " invited him to be a contestant			0
but before that , he stunned the 11 - time world champion , @entity73 , to become the super-sized @entity74 of the @entity75			0
i was in @entity77 on the 2004 day when ol ' @entity66 qualified for the @entity20 once more ... after a motorcycle crash , after dislocating a wrist in a pick - up basketball game and after a snowmobile misadventure led to a case of frostbite and the loss of a toe			1
why keep wrestling ? " to be able to represent us in the greatest sport in the world ... the oldest sport in the world ? " @entity66 replied			1
" to get to do that ? wow			0
" wow , for sure			0
that was my reaction tuesday and the reaction from wrestlers everywhere -- a " nightmare , " the former collegiate king of the mat , @entity100 , described it in one interview -- at the @entity13 's proposal ( not yet a done deal ) that certain sports are to be abandoned by 2020 , with wrestling among those on the hit list			1
somewhere among the gods , @entity109 weeps			0
you might not know your @entity18 from your @entity114 , but it was 708 b.c. when wrestling was a part of the first @entity20 , historians tell us			1
and it was 1896 when the so - called " @entity20 " were born ... and , yes , wrestling was there in @entity41 that summer as well			1
it is hand - to - hand combat in its essence			0
@entity129 and @entity130 have competed in @entity20 wrestling , as have @entity132 and @entity133 , and @entity134 and @entity135 , and @entity136 and @entity137 , and so many more			1
do you have any idea how many @entity20 wrestling medals have been won by athletes from @entity142 and @entity143 ? take a guess			1
six ? 10 ? try 167			0
@entity145 has won 68 @entity20 medals in this sport			1
@entity145 do n't wait around much to see how their athletes do in @entity20 figure - skating or tennis or synchronized swimming			1
but in wrestling , @entity145 kick butt			1
the @entity20 are n't just for sports superpowers , not just for @entity155 and @entity61 and the @entity27 , @entity27 ! @entity156 has won golds in @entity20 wrestling			1
i 'll bet an @entity156 today would say , hey , if you want to drop something , drop badminton , drop beach volleyball			0
as for these @entity27 , well , you can prattle on about @entity165 or @entity166 or @entity167 or any other famed olympian we have produced , but keep in mind this : our wrestlers have won 50 golds			1
and 125 medals in all			0
that mat meant every bit as much to them as that pool did to @entity179 , as that gym apparatus did to @entity181 , as that hardwood floor did to @entity183			0
wrestlers are human , man			1
if you pin them , do they not bleed ? i am thinking of scholastic wrestlers all over the globe who starve themselves to make weight , devote countless hours to training for a match , learn every hold and every escape			1
most do n't dream of selling out @entity199 some day			0
they do often fantasize about ducking their heads to have a necklace with a medallion draped around their necks			0
high school wrestling has been the stuff of literature and cinema , from " @entity211 " to " @entity212			1
" it has been a part of many a young man 's formative years			2
it has now become part of a 21st century young woman 's world as well			2
without it , we do n't have young @entity221 of @entity222 , @entity223 , growing up to beat cancer and beat his opponent in the 1984 super-heavyweight gold - medal match , quite a feat for a kid who had his spleen and appendix taken out			2
we do n't have @entity21 , a night earlier , caressing his gold medal with one hand , his pregnant wife with the other , and inviting a reporter ( me ) , " hey , come on over to the hotel			0
we 'll be partying all night ! " because there wo n't be any @entity20 wrestlers any more			1
not if the @entity13 goes through with this preposterous proposition			0
ca n't we talk these people out of it ? @entity242 them some 2020 hindsight ? i do think we can convince them , and i 'm pretty sure that i know how			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			1

@entity250 : **committee** proposes dropping wrestling from 2020 @entity254
he says wrestlers have had lives raised up and have *exalted* their nations at the @entity20
he says wrestling goes back to the very first games in 708 b.c.
@entity250 : young wrestlers will lose *important* goal ; olympic **committee** should *reconsider*
