-- are you truly happy ? where you live , what you do and how much sex you have just might be the answer ! the biggest complainer @entity0 knows is her makeup artist @entity7			1
after a recent " @entity0 , " he agreed to take pastor @entity9 's complaint - free challenge			2
@entity7 wears a purple wristband , and every time he utters a complaint , he has to change the wrist he wears it on			2
@entity14 and her makeup artist @entity7 share some laughter			1
how did he do ? @entity0 says @entity7 " complained so much that he was getting whiplash from changing [ wrists ]			2
" for some extra help in looking on the bright side , @entity0 sent him to a class in " laughing yoga			2
" first developed in @entity23 , @entity22 is now practiced in 53 countries around the world			2
@entity7 's instructor , @entity26 -- one of 48 certified @entity22 instructors in the @entity28 -- says @entity22 's positive effects are no joke			2
" @entity22 relieves all the negative effects of stress , " he says			1
" it strengthens the abdominal organs and help you get those six - pack abs we 're all looking for			2
it releases endorphins , the body 's natural painkiller			2
" the class starts cold , and @entity7 remains cynical			2
" we 're going to start with nothing and laugh for no reason , and you 'll feel better , " @entity26 says			1
but as they move on to more advanced moves -- like lion laughter , naughty naughty and @entity52 -- @entity7 really starts to catch the laughing bug			2
@entity7 works up a sweat , but can he change his complaining ways ? @entity7 says that before his @entity56 , he was depressed			2
it was the saturday before @entity58 , he was lonely and he doubted the class would do much to change that			2
" it was very goofy in the beginning ... but you ca n't fake a laugh , " he says			1
" once you get into it ... the stress lifted from my soul , it lifted from my body			1
" dr. @entity71 , author of " @entity72 " says chronic complainers like @entity7 actually live in fear of happiness			2
their condition -- which he dubs " happy - chondria " -- is based on a belief that any happiness carries an eventual fall and price			1
" rather than have everything be perfect and full , i 'll have it be quite good and complain , " he says			2
" @entity7 's got to dare to let life be great and trust that happiness can happen and that it can last			1
" one woman 's courageous decision to live the life of her dreams			1
by the time she was 29 , @entity90 was a successful banking executive on @entity92			1
she made vice president in her division and earned a healthy salary			2
she says she had " a traditional definition of success that had a lot to do with material things , " but after eight grueling years in business , @entity90 says she knew she was not on the road to happiness			2
" i felt proud , but the work was not inspiring me			2
i did n't have passion for that work			0
i felt like i had to stifle parts of myself in order to be what @entity92 wanted from me			1
i felt like i was playing a corporate character , like it was n't coming from inside of me , who i really am , " she says			0
@entity90 knew that making a big change meant taking an even bigger risk			0
" i was about to turn 30 , and i realized it was time for me to live the life i wanted for myself , not the life that other people wanted for me , " she says			1
" it 's not making me happy to sit here at this desk anymore			1
i can not blame anyone else for my unhappiness			0
i completely believe life is short			1
you do not get a second chance			0
i was standing at an edge , and for me it was time to jump			0
" @entity90 took a 90 percent pay cut and traded the high - wire act of finance for a career as a trapeze artist ! following her dream is " like laughter in my heart , " she says			1
" it 's hard to quantify that fulfillment that comes with it , but it greatly exceeds the compensation that i sacrificed			0
" dr. @entity71 says the key to being happy is overcoming " destination addiction , " which he defines as " living in the not - now			1
" " it 's always about tomorrow , so you 're chasing ' more , ' ' next ' and ' there , ' " he says			0
" you promise yourself that when you get there , you 'll be happy			1
and i promise you , you wo n't , because you 'll always set another destination to go for			0
" instead , dr. @entity71 says if you are unhappy with your life or looking to improve your score on the satisfaction test , there are two things you can do			1
" we have to learn to let go of our past , we have to give up all hopes for a perfect past			0
let the past go , it 's gone			0
" after that , he says , " take a vow of kindness			0
be kinder to yourself and to others			0
" it 's never too late to be happy , " he says			1
can more sex make you happy ? find out what one woman did to rev up her sex life ! @entity173 and @entity174 were the average suburban couple raising two kids			1
but after just two years of marriage , something was missing			0
" after we had our kids , our sex life just kind of vanished			1
it was n't a priority anymore , and if my husband wanted it , i thought it was up to him to initiate it , " @entity173 says			0
" the lack of sex was creating unhappiness in the rest of our life			1
we were snapping at each other			0
we were n't very patient and understanding			0
" after seeing an " @entity0 " about how important sex was to a marriage , @entity173 realized she needed to spice things up in a big way			1
" i said , ' this is what we 're going to do			0
we 're going to have sex every night			1
i 'm not going to tell him			0
i 'm going to get babysitters			0
i 'm going to make a date , ' " she says			1
@entity173 also started dressing up , wearing more makeup , learned how to strip from dvds and took belly dancing courses			0
she also took sex out of the bedroom and brought it into other places in her home			1
how did @entity174 react ? " in my mind i thought , ' i know women hit their sexual peak later , ' " he says			0
" i did not question it at all			0
" three years after @entity173 thought up this plan , their sex life is still going strong			1
@entity173 says she and @entity174 still have sex almost every night			1
" if we do n't , it 's because we 're extremely exhausted or @entity174 's away on a business trip , " @entity173 says			0
" not because we do n't want to			0
" in fact , having sex every night has brought @entity173 and @entity174 closer as a couple			1
" we 're better parents			0
we 're happier people , " @entity173 says			1
" the more sex we have , the more touchy and more affectionate we are with one another			1
& so we 're better parents and our kids			0
oh , they pick up on this			0
they feel happy because @entity234 are happy			1
" happiness expert dr. @entity71 says @entity173 and @entity174 have the right idea			0
" i think the big thing , guys , which i really appreciate about you , is i think you understand that sex is communication			1
& so there 's intimacy here , " he says			0
" one of the big mistakes i think we make in relationships is that we do n't give our best energy to the people that matter most			1
and i think what you 're doing is you 're making that time to be able to give some of your best energy to each other			0
