@entity0 -- call me crazy , but i recall when presidential candidates ran for the high office because they had things to say			1
the notion went like this : i have ideas that i think will be great for the country			2
i have thought about them , vetted them with experts , spoken about them throughout my career			0
i have refined them , many times , even changed some			0
and now i think it 's time to run for the presidency , armed with those ideas to present to the nation			1
so imagine my surprise when , at a recent debate , @entity23 gov. @entity22 turned to @entity25 and , with a certain amount of disdain , sniffed , " @entity25 has had six years to be working on a plan			1
i have been in this for about eight weeks			0
" in other words , i 'll get back to you			0
so , is it really a bad thing that @entity25 spent years working on ideas -- changing some , obviously -- to prepare for another presidential run ? or is it actually worse that @entity22 first had a team of consultants and strategists , and then got to work on the ideas part of the program ? @entity42 did n't have to cram a belief system into a new 10 - point plan to save the country , because he knew what he believed -- and refined and road - tested his plans -- before he ran			1
neither did @entity50 , who did have a ' putting @entity52 ' plan , which contained ideas on welfare reform and education that he had spoken about for years			1
both men had beliefs -- and of course , ambition -- before they had presidential campaigns			2
this time the process is oddly perverse			0
a large chunk of the @entity64 base is looking for a candidate to fill their own belief system : fiscal and social conservative , tough on immigration , tax - cutter , and on and on			1
they could go with @entity25 -- and probably will , in the end -- but they 're skeptical about his bona fides. they did n't like him last time around , and they 're afraid to like him this time			1
the tea party activists have become the @entity64 's theatrical directors			0
@entity80 played well in @entity81 , but never made it to @entity83			0
@entity22 looked right for the part , but blew his lines			2
and @entity86 , well , he 's very entertaining			0
they 're looking for the sort of artistic perfection which , as we have all learned , is not necessarily a presidential trait			0
they like @entity86 's 9 - 9 - 9 tax plan , but he 's too unreliable on the abortion issue			1
they may like @entity22 's new optional flat tax , but cringe at his more liberal views on immigration that allow the children of illegal immigrants to get in - state tuition in @entity23			1
and what about @entity80 claiming , without any proof , that the hpv vaccine can cause mental retardation ? not exactly a presidential move			0
when @entity22 entered the race as the fave du jour , it was n't because of his specific ideas , or his specific record , or his specific abilities : it was because the @entity64 base had a slot to fill , and they thought he was the guy to fill it			1
he was conservative , after all			0
then he appeared on stage , and somehow appeared smaller than the role demanded			0
he began the campaign with an energy plan -- predictable from the governor of @entity23			2
but when pressed for more , he finally delivered a flat tax -- an updated version of the @entity127 flat tax that never quite caught on enough to get him nominated when he ran in 1996			0
it 's an idea @entity22 has always said he liked , but now he apparently owns it , having cooked up his own version on the fly			1
there 's a strange whiff here of back - of - the - envelope campaigns			2
@entity86 has a tax plan that catapulted him to the lead , then @entity22 tries out another catchy plan to regain the lead			1
" it 's a gimmick in response to a gimmick , " says @entity140 , a @entity25 adviser			1
so could it be that @entity25 's problem is that he is n't gimmicky enough for these tryouts ? he 's got a serious , boring , 59 - point ( how un-gimmicky is that ? ) plan for the economy that does not include a silver bullet to fix all			1
he does not believe there is one			0
yet if you asked @entity25 to recite all 59 points , i bet he could do it			2
i bet he has actually thought a great deal about each one			0
as he learned the hard way the last time around , presidential politics is a different kind of drama : you ca n't win the lead by reading other people 's lines			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			2

@entity169 : *traditionally* presidents have run for office based on long - held beliefs
she says candidates such as @entity22 are running first , putting out plans later
@entity22 's new tax plan seems like a gimmick designed to help him regain lead , she says
@entity169 : she says @entity25 developed ideas before he started his campaign
