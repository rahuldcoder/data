@entity0 , @entity1 -- an agreement reached sunday in @entity1 will help tackle the challenges of climate change for years to come , the @entity4 ' chief said			1
@entity4 @entity8 ban ki - moon hailed the decision reached by parties of the @entity11 in @entity0 , @entity1 , which agreed to extend efforts set forth in the @entity13			1
the @entity13 , ratified by 37 industrialized countries , was set to expire in 2012			1

@entity27 " welcomes the agreement to establish a second commitment period of the @entity13 that will increase certainty for the carbon market and provides additional incentives for new investments in technology and the infrastructure necessary to fight climate change , " according to a statement from his office			1

the talks also launched the @entity38 , which would essentially channel about $ 100 billion by 2020 to vulnerable countries to help them deal with the effects of climate change			1
@entity43 chief negotiator @entity42 described the talks as " tough " but worthwhile			0
" for the first time there is an agreement to negotiate a legal accord of some sort , a legal instrument that is applicable to all countries -- that is a new thing			0
that means @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 -- and there is no hedging in it , " @entity42 said			0
he added , " we have been pushing for the last three years continually to change the paradigm of this negotiation so it did apply to all the big emitters because you ca n't solve this problem if you have 50 - 60 % of world emissions not at the table			2
so an agreement to do this legal accord -- that 's applicable to of all the major parties , that 's a big deal			0

critics who were not satisfied with the outcome include the international charity @entity99 , which said negotiators at the @entity4 climate talks agreed to the " bare minimum deal possible			1
" " the plan gets the @entity38 up and running without any sources of funding ... and gets a second commitment period of the @entity13 without key members , " @entity99 said in a statement sunday			1
without further action , @entity99 said , " farmers in parts of @entity1 could face a drop in crop yields of more than 50 % within this generation or that of their children			2
food prices could more than double within the next two decades , up to half of which caused by climate change			2
