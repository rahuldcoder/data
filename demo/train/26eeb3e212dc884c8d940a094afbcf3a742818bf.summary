@entity0 -- a senior @entity3 general admits that " virginity checks " were performed on women arrested at a demonstration this spring , the first such admission after previous denials by military authorities			1
the allegations arose in an @entity12 report , published weeks after the march 9 protest			1
it claimed female demonstrators were beaten , given electric shocks , strip - searched , threatened with prostitution charges and forced to submit to virginity checks			1
at that time , maj. @entity19 said 17 women had been arrested but denied allegations of torture or " virginity tests			1
" but now a senior general who asked not to be identified said the virginity tests were conducted and defended the practice			1
" the girls who were detained were not like your daughter or mine , " the general said			2
" these were girls who had camped out in tents with male protesters in @entity34 , and we found in the tents @entity38 cocktails and ( drugs )			0
" the general said the virginity checks were done so that the women would n't later claim they had been raped by @entity3 authorities			1
" we did n't want them to say we had sexually assaulted or raped them , so we wanted to prove that they were n't virgins in the first place , " the general said			1
" none of them were ( virgins )			0
" this demonstration occurred nearly a month after @entity3 's longtime president @entity52 stepped down amid a wave of popular and mostly peaceful unrest aimed at his ouster and the institution of democratic reforms			1
afterward , @entity3 's military -- which had largely stayed on the sidelines of the revolution -- officially took control of the nation 's political apparatus as well , until an agreed - upon constitution and elections			1
@entity52 denies ordering shootings the march 9 protest occurred in @entity34 , which became famous over 18 historic and sometimes bloody days and nights of protests that led to @entity52 's resignation			1
but unlike in those previous demonstrations , the @entity3 military targeted the protesters			2
soldiers dragged dozens of demonstrators from the square and through the gates of the landmark @entity79			0
@entity80 , a 20 - year - old hairdresser and one of the women named in the @entity12 report , described to @entity1 how uniformed soldiers tied her up on the museum 's grounds , forced her to the ground and slapped her , then shocked her with a stun gun while calling her a prostitute			2
" they wanted to teach us a lesson , " @entity80 said soon after the @entity12 report came out			2
" they wanted to make us feel that we do not have dignity			2
" the treatment got worse , @entity80 said , when she and the 16 other female prisoners were taken to a military detention center in @entity98			0
there , she said , she and several of other female detainees were subjected to a " virginity test			0
" " we did not agree for a male doctor to perform the test , " she said			0
but @entity80 said her captors forced her to comply by threatening her with more stun - gun shocks			0
" i was going through a nervous breakdown at that moment , " she recalled			0
" there was no one standing during the test , except for a woman and the male doctor			0
but several soldiers were standing behind us watching the backside of the bed			0
i think they had them standing there as witnesses			0
" the senior @entity3 general said the 149 people detained after the march 9 protest were subsequently tried in military courts , and most have been sentenced to a year in prison			1
authorities later revoked those sentences " when we discovered that some of the detainees had university degrees , so we decided to give them a second chance , " he said			0
the senior general reaffirmed that the military council was determined to make @entity3 's democratic transition a success			1
" the date for handover to a civil government ca n't come soon enough for the ruling military council , " he said			0
" the army ca n't wait to return to its barracks and do what it does best -- protect the nation 's borders			2
