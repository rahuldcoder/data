@entity0 , @entity1 , in @entity1 , showcasing the films that could make waves on the global festival circuit			1
the @entity5 movie industry gathered in @entity12 , in the @entity14 region of @entity1 , for the fifth annual " @entity15			1
" set up in 2005 by former lawyer @entity17 , the awards have helped raise the profile of @entity5 movies around the world			1
" african film has a hard time in getting recognition in most film festivals [ outside @entity27 ] , " @entity22 told @entity2			0
" i think one of the biggest achievements of the @entity7 is that the main festivals now look upon us as a selection process , and will pick those particular films that we 've looked at and carry them on to the different festival circuits			1
" the first @entity36 film that the @entity37 showed was ' @entity38 , ' by @entity39 , which won @entity41 at @entity7 in 2007			1
' @entity42 ' premiered at @entity43 this year and has gone on to other film festivals and ' @entity45 ' traveled the festival circuit based on its win at @entity7			1
" " @entity42 , " a thriller about a sculpture with mystical powers , also by @entity1 director @entity39 , stole the show at this year 's ceremony , claiming five awards in total -- including @entity53			1
@entity5 football star @entity58 shares his @entity60 dream @entity39 told @entity2 , " it feels great -- like we 've not worked in vain			2
it feels like we 've opened up a new page in @entity5 cinema			2
" for me , a good story will cut across , not just appeal to @entity1 but will appeal to an average film lover , regardless of the language you speak , the continent you are from , or the color of your skin			2
" in its first years the @entity75 focused on @entity1 's booming movie industry -- known as " @entity36			1
" but since then they have become more pan-african			0
the 24 awards at this year 's ceremony included nominations from across the continent			2
nonetheless , in terms of sheer output , @entity1 dominates @entity5 cinema			1
@entity1 is the world 's second - biggest producer of movies , behind only @entity87			1
in 2006 it produced 872 movies , compared with 485 major feature films made in the @entity90 , according to the @entity91			0
nollywood movies are typically low - budget -- often filmed , edited and released within a month			0
most do n't end up on the big screen			0
instead , they are distributed as vcds costing about $ 1 to $ 2 , meaning they are affordable for the mass @entity5 market			2
but it is @entity36 's pioneering use of relatively inexpensive digital cameras instead of costly 35mm film that @entity22 says has been its most important contribution to @entity5 cinema			1
" there is a new wave of @entity5 cinema which is mostly the digital revolution , which has gone on from what @entity36 started in the early 90s , " she told @entity2			1
" @entity1 made people believe they could make films for less [ by using digital cameras ]			2
that has spread across the continent and i think that 's a good thing , otherwise @entity27 would not be able to have any kind of production , because it could n't afford it			0
" you see a lot of the older generation of filmmakers from @entity27 who have made only one short film or one feature - length film in their lifetime , because they have not been able to make up the cost of making another film			0
" @entity22 said that while some older filmmakers still believe movies should be shot only on 35mm film , directors from @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity131 's " @entity130 " have now made the switch to digital			0
she added that while every @entity5 country has its own movie - making style , the themes are often universal			0
" everyone tries to do a film that people in their own community will watch , " she said			0
" but i 've found that all over the continent we have similar stories -- it 's just how we tell them			0
" @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report			0
