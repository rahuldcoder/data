@entity0 , the former second - in - command at the @entity1 , appears to be the top choice to replace outgoing secretary @entity3			1
barring any last minute complications , @entity4 will be president @entity7 's choice as the new secretary of defense , several @entity10 administration officials told @entity11			0
an administration official had said that homeland security secretary @entity13 , a former general counsel at the @entity1 , was also still on the list of possibilities , but on tuesday morning , sources said @entity13 was no longer being considered			1
the prospect of an additional confirmation hearing for @entity13 's replacement if he were to move to the @entity1 as the @entity20 switches to @entity22 control would have been problematic for the @entity23			1
related : was @entity24 doomed from the start ? @entity24 announced his resignation last week , but has said he will stay on until his successor is confirmed by the @entity20			0
@entity0 , who served as deputy defense secretary under both @entity30 and @entity24 , would bring a wide range of experience to a department confronting multiple crises in the @entity35 and preparing to enter a new phase in @entity37 as the @entity39 combat mission ends			1
@entity0 's ability to hit the ground running from his past experience at the @entity1 , in addition to the respect many senior military leaders have for him are seen as major benefits to winning confirmation should @entity7 nominate him			1
" his career has sort of prepared him perfectly for this kind of a moment , " says @entity49 , a defense industry analyst at the @entity50			0
in addition to a broad understanding of the @entity1 bureaucracy , @entity0 is seen as a master of managing large budgets , a premium in the present era of continued belt tightening on @entity61 , as well as an expert on weapons acquisitions			2
related : @entity23 struggles to find @entity24 successor he also has a firm grasp on understanding the trends and technology of warfare in the future			2
" on paper and in terms of his resume and preparation you probably could n't do much better , " @entity49 said			0
but @entity0 does lack certain experience shared by @entity24 , @entity30 had and many other secretaries - first -- hand military experience			2
@entity0 has extensive experience at the @entity1 and in academia , but he was never actually in the military			1
" you can always find things that you would have loved in a hundred year life span to have seen everyone do before they take this job , but realistically he has accomplished about as much as you could ask , " @entity49 said			0
whoever is ultimately selected may not have much opportunity to make a mark at the @entity1			0
they 'll likely have less than two years likely on the job after confirmation			0
the next defense secretary will confront the specter of another possible round of automatic budget cuts known as sequestration to navigate with @entity100 , along with a @entity23 known by some for micromanaging foreign and defense policy			1
while @entity0 was always seen likely on @entity7 's short - list of candidates , his name gained prominence following the withdrawals from consideration by former @entity1 official @entity109 and sen. @entity110 that they not be considered for the post			1
@entity0 , who does not have a background as a political operative , is believed to be open to returning to the @entity1 , and would likely generate a smooth confirmation process officials tell @entity11			2
he was previously a professor at @entity116 's @entity115 , and was recently listed as a senior executive at the @entity118 .			0
