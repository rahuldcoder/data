@entity0 -- @entity3 's parliament on saturday debated demands by a 74 - year - old anti-corruption activist in what an opposition leader called a " historic occasion " for lawmakers to come together in the fight against graft			1
the discussion came on the 12th day of campaigner @entity14 's hunger strike calling for a powerful @entity15 , or citizen ombudsman , to deal with massive bribes and kickbacks			1
talks with the government hit a roadblock over three of his demands , which include bringing members of @entity3 's lower bureaucracy under the new watchdog			1
the federal government put the case before parliament			2
@entity30 , leader of the opposition in the lower chamber of the national assembly , said her group agreed with the three points			1
she called saturday 's sitting a " historic occasion , " saying tens of thousands of @entity14 supporters expect effective mechanisms to tackle corruption in their daily lives			1
a similar debate was also under way in the upper chamber -- the house of elders -- in @entity3 's parliament			1
it was , however , not immediately clear when legislation to establish a @entity15 would be passed			2
saturday 's meeting of the @entity3 parliament aimed at eliciting opinion of the federal legislature , composed of ruling and opposition parties , over setting up a tough anti-corruption institution			1
finance minister @entity54 initiated the debate , describing it as an opportunity to show political will to handle corruption			2
" i am sure that members of this house will seize this moment and demonstrate the commitment of the house in dealing with corruption which is gnawing at the vitals of our polity , " @entity54 told parliament			2
@entity14 's fast -- a tactic adopted by @entity3 's independence leader @entity70 against the colonial rule -- has also drawn criticism			1
on friday , lawmaker @entity73 , whose mother heads the governing @entity75 , warned parliament not to allow the nation 's democracy to be undermined , in an apparent disapproval of the high - profile hunger strike			1
" individuals have brought our country great gains			0
they have galvanized people in the cause of freedom and development			0
however , we must not weaken the democratic process , " @entity70 , who is tipped by @entity3 media as a future prime minister , said in a speech			0
he thanked @entity14 for articulating what he called larger public disillusionment with a system plagued by endemic corruption			1
but in his address , the 40 - year - old general secretary of the @entity75 cautioned against pressuring elected bodies			0
" this ( democratic ) process is often lengthy and lumbering			0
but it is so in order to be inclusive and fair			0
it provides a representative and transparent platform where ideas are translated into laws , " @entity70 said			0
" a process divorced from the machinery of an elected government , or this house , that seeks to undo the checks and balances created to protect the supremacy of parliament sets a dangerous precedent for a democracy , " he told lawmakers			1
three of @entity70 's ancestors -- @entity121 , @entity122 and his father , @entity123 , -- have served as the country 's prime minister in the past			2
echoing current prime minister @entity128 's views that any institution alone can not eradicate corruption , @entity70 described the proposed @entity15 as just one tool in the fight			2
" witnessing the events of the last few days , it would appear that the enactment of a single bill will usher in a corruption - free society			0
i have serious doubts about this belief , " @entity70 said			0
" an effective @entity15 law is only one element in the legal framework to combat corruption			0
the @entity15 institution alone can not be a substitute for a comprehensive anti-corruption code			0
a set of effective laws is required			0
