@entity0 -- a number of security lapses in an airport shuttle system in @entity0 is raising concerns among some @entity7 officers and state senators			1
" among the cops it 's commonly referred to as a possible weapons delivery system , " said one @entity10 official of the @entity12 shuttle system that ferries thousands of passengers to and from @entity14			1
the official did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue			0
the lack of security on the system -- an eight - mile fully automated , unmanned railroad -- was discussed friday at a state homeland security hearing to discuss vulnerabilities that still remain 10 years after the 9/11 attacks on @entity0 and @entity28			1
" there 's no scanning of bags , there 's no scanning of passengers , " said state sen. @entity29 , who is also the chairman of the @entity31 @entity30			0
" we should have uniformed personnel on that transportation corridor , we do n't			0
" @entity42 vice president @entity41 described it simply as " a bad situation , " pointing out that the airport shuttle trains enter the international arrivals building of the airport directly underneath departures where airlines such as @entity50 operate			1
@entity53 terminal , planes evacuated after screening glitch " @entity7 's own security study prior to the deployment of that system was for 18 police officers a day to police the system			1
three tours of duty a day , 365 days a year , " @entity41 told the panel			0
" in the last 12 months we 've had 40 tours , which is about two weeks ' worth of coverage with one officer			0
" the hearing , requested by @entity29 , took place following a complaint in march by the @entity0 division of the @entity42 , a nationwide union representing police officers			1
the union cited a lack of security on the airport shuttle in their complaint			1
the @entity7 and @entity77 is responsible for security at @entity0 airports , bridges and tunnels			1
the @entity7 said in a statement friday that there is no lapse in security			1
" the way the @entity10 is deployed , as well as cameras and the entirety of our security apparatus , means the traveling public should feel safe within all of the @entity7 facilities , " the statement said			2
@entity94 , spokesman for the @entity95 , acknowledged saturday that the @entity7 is a huge organization with many responsibilities			2
when it comes to transporting people and developing commerce in the bistate region , he said the agency does a great job			0
" the problem is it does n't take public safety and security concerns seriously , " he said			2
according to @entity94 , the biggest problem with safety on the @entity12 system is a lack of communication , noting specifically the lack of a central radio system in the new @entity114			1
@entity41 also noted the lack of an operable radio system in the terminal , saying officers instead are issued cell phones -- a slower form of communication when officers need to quickly call for backup or relay information			0
while officers in the terminal do carry radios on their belts , they " might as well be carrying a brick , " @entity41 said friday			0
@entity94 pointed to the example of @entity130 , the @entity114 flight attendant that pulled the emergency slide of a plane and ran from the airport			0
" that 's how he got away , " said @entity94			0
" the two cops on duty had no idea what was going on			0
" while @entity142 's stunt did n't injure anyone , @entity94 believes his escape exhibits the real safety threat to people in the airport and terminals surrounding @entity12			2
ball 's office said another hearing will be held in @entity152 next month to follow up on some of the concerns detailed in friday 's meeting .			2
