-- every awards ceremony has its reputation , and @entity4 's @entity3 proudly wears the badge of scandal			1
where the @entity7 are elegant and the @entity9 rowdy , the @entity3 are all about testing the boundaries of what culture deems " decent " and reveling in youthful ( and , yes , sometimes immature ) freedom			2
this reputation was cemented from the first @entity3 broadcast in 1984 , when a then - 26 - year - old @entity14 sensually writhed on stage in a wedding dress to " @entity17			1
" at the time , she was told her antics would ruin her career -- when in fact the opposite happened			0
it 's now one of the most well - known moments not only from the @entity3 , but from the now 55 - year - old 's legendary career			1
countless pop stars and rockers have followed in @entity14 's footsteps , with each new year bearing the promise of an ever - shocking performance			1
@entity4 @entity3 : from @entity34 to @entity35 , why i know to expect the unexpected so when @entity36 took the @entity3 stage on sunday and proceeded to provocatively dance ( with teddy bears , no less ) before removing even more clothing , was she committing the offense the @entity41 has claimed , or simply upholding 30 years of @entity3 tradition ? with her striptease , 20 - year - old @entity43 did n't do anything her predecessors have n't already			1
in 2000 , @entity47 was not yet 19 when she ripped off a pantsuit at the @entity3 to reveal a sparkling , flesh - toned body stocking underneath			1
as host network @entity4 has said of the memorable moment , @entity47 ' " striptease ( not to mention the accompanying panting and grinding ) served notice that @entity47 was no longer the pigtailed schoolgirl of the ' ... @entity55 ' video , but rather a full - grown , supremely sexy woman			0
" the singer followed up that headline - making move by dancing seductively with a snake in 2001			0
in 2003 , as a callback to the @entity3 original " @entity17 " performance , @entity47 and @entity61 wore wedding white for the performance			2
and then there was the famous @entity47 kiss with @entity14			0
when that scene threw @entity47 back into the crossfire , the pop star told @entity0 that she was just " performing and expressing myself			0
" and need we remind you of @entity75 's havoc - filled performance of " lithium " in 1992 , or @entity77 feeling up @entity79 's bare breast in 1999 ? ( if you need a refresher , recall that @entity79 was wearing a violet bodysuit that exposed one breast , which was covered with nothing more than a matching purple pasty			0
) @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 ( the latter was at this very same show ! ) have all bared their bums for @entity4 's viewers			0
6 memorable moments from the 2013 @entity3 to be sure , @entity43 ' sunday performance took notes from all of the above and combined them into one show - stealing set			1
but that 's more or less what the @entity3 have historically been : a place to go wild ( within reach of censors ) , and a platform for young stars to show the world that they 're now adults , perhaps even one that feels comfortable bending over in front of an audience and dancing in a latex two - piece			1
yet the reaction to @entity43 appears to be more eviscerating than previous years			0
some viewers were in awe that this is the same @entity43 who was once the @entity114 's teen queen on " @entity115 , " and others aghast at the provocativeness of her performance			1
" raise your hand if you feel personally victimized by @entity36 ' # @entity3 performance , " tweeted @entity120 ! online			1
" do you think ( @entity36 's dad ) @entity43 woke up with an achy breaky heart this morning after his little girl 's performance at the @entity3 last night ? " said @entity126 's @entity125			1
@entity131 , posting a picture of @entity43 from her 2012 movie " @entity134 , " tweeted that he 'll " always have this version of @entity36			1
let 's live in the past and heal			0
" @entity43 herself has been silent about her set and its overwhelming reaction , but anyone who 's paid the slightest attention to the star would n't be too surprised by her routine			1
although she rose to fame on " @entity115 , " a role she landed at just 13 , @entity43 has always had a rocky relationship with the squeaky clean image she was expected to uphold			2
at 15 , the singer / actress came under fire after she posed topless for @entity155 , holding a sheet to her chest as she gazed at the camera			0
the following year , @entity43 was criticized for her @entity160 performance , during which she danced atop an ice cream cart -- complete with a pole -- while singing her hit , " @entity166 " the moment would infamously become known as @entity43 ' " pole dance			2
in the days following her 18th birthday in 2010 , @entity43 was subjected to more scrutiny when a video surfaced of the star smoking a bong apparently filled with salvia			0
the attention has only increased in the years since , as @entity43 has tried to transition from her @entity114 days into being a grown - up pop star , complete with an eye - catching haircut and the occasional middle finger thrown up in photographs			1
while her critics have been vocal about their discomfort with her behavior , @entity43 has said that she 's simply being herself			2
speaking on her new album , " @entity187 , " to @entity186 , she said that she feels like " i can really be myself			0
... i really have more of a connection of who i am , and i feel like i can maybe express that more in my music now			0
" basically , we 're hearing @entity47 2.0			0
the moves @entity14 and @entity47 once performed at the @entity3 are now an indelible part of pop culture history , moments that make the @entity3 appointment - viewing after 29 years			2
( @entity198 , for example , has come up with an astonishing 95 reasons why the " vmas are absolutely nothing without @entity47			0
" ) will @entity43 ' 2013 performance receive the same fate ? it 's far too early to tell			2
but if the legacy of the @entity3 is any indication , she 's going to express what she wants -- whether we like it or not .			2

@entity36 stunned viewers at sunday 's @entity3
but the 20 - year - old is far from the first to pull off such a stunt
the @entity3 are known for their *outlandish* performances
and , @entity43 has increasingly worked to shed her @entity114 image
