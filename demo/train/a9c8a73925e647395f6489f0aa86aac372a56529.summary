-- former @entity2 gov. @entity1 responded angrily on her @entity4 page friday to a verbal attack by @entity7 president @entity6 where he called her a " crazy magnet			1
" " i 'm not sure why he 's attacking my record when i 'm not the one responsible for the policies resulting in continued mass unemployment and a weak economy , " @entity1 shot back			2
" among my ' crimes , ' the union boss cited the fact that i sometimes write notes on my hand ( guilty as charged ! ) ; that i appear on cable television every once in a while to comment on the news ( it 's called the @entity22 , @entity23 ) ; and that my common sense conservatism makes him laugh			1
" @entity6 released the text of the speech before he gave it on thursday at his organization 's convention in @entity2			0
in it he complains that every time @entity32 have proposed jobs legislation they have been blocked by " the most politically motivated @entity35 minority we have ever seen -- and i really do mean ever ... then he asks , " what is this crazy magnet that 's pulling people to the right ? i mean , look at your former governor ... " " after she tied herself to @entity42 and they lost , she blew off @entity2 , " he said			1
" i guess she figured she 'd trade up -- shoot for a national stage			0
@entity2 was too far from the @entity47 spotlight			0
i bet most of you , on a clear day , can see her hypocrisy from your house			0
" @entity1 provided her own assessment of @entity6 on her @entity4 response			2
" @entity6 's attempts to put himself on the side of the working man and woman would be more convincing if he were n't a career union boss who 's spent most of his life in @entity62 , " the statement on @entity1 's @entity4 page said			1
" no surprise then that his priorities are n't the priorities of the average working man or woman , but of the @entity71 power player			2
" @entity0 's @entity72 contributed to this report .			0
