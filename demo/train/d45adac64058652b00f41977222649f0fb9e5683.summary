@entity0 , @entity1 -- authorities might find out tuesday whether a body was buried under a shed in @entity0 , @entity1			1
they just wo n't know whether it 's missing @entity8 boss @entity7 or not			1
two soil samples were taken from a home in the suburban @entity12 community of @entity0 last week after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried on the property a day after @entity7 disappeared in 1975			1
the samples were taken from beneath a storage shed and sent to a lab at @entity19 for tests to determine the presence of human remains			2
the hope had been to get the findings back sometime monday			0
but in a press release issued monday afternoon , @entity0 police chief @entity25 said he 'd been told that , while testing had begun , " the results of those tests will not be available until early ( tuesday ) morning			1
" what police do know is that the samples that were unearthed did n't contain any " discernible remains , " such as bones , body parts or other evidence , according to @entity33			1
the search of the @entity0 property is the latest in an on - again , off - again search for @entity7 , whose disappearance 35 years ago captured the public imagination			1
@entity7 , then 62 , was last seen on july 30 , 1975 , outside the @entity12 - area @entity43 restaurant			2
he was there ostensibly to meet with reputed @entity46 street enforcer @entity45 and @entity49 crime family figure @entity47 , who was also a chief of a @entity50 local in @entity52			0
@entity45 died in 1982 ; @entity47 died in 1988 in prison			0
the tipster , a former gambler , once did business with a man tied to @entity45 , said @entity58 , author of " the @entity59			0
" @entity58 said he first spoke to the tipster in march and then sent him to police			2
vanished @entity7 still fascinates after almost 40 years despite those links , @entity58 said it seems unlikely that anyone would have been buried at the site , in full view of the neighborhood			1
and if a body had been buried there , little would remain , he said			2
the lab tests being conducted on the soil samples will be able to determine if human remains were buried at the site , but will not identify them , @entity25 said			1
if human remains are discovered , investigators would have to return for a more complete excavation , he said			0
even so , @entity33 doubts any possible human remains discovered at the house would be those of @entity7			2
" it would be great if it was , because i would like to bring closure to his family and the tens of thousands of @entity50 that idolize this man , and just the southeast of @entity1 , " @entity25 said			2
" this is kind of like an open wound that wo n't go away			0
every couple of years this happens , and all you guys come out here and we have to relive it			0
" but @entity25 said the " time line does n't really add up			0
" @entity7 was of the most powerful union leaders at a time when unions wielded enormous political sway			1
he was forced out of the organized labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud			0
president @entity104 pardoned him in 1971 on condition he not attempt to get back into the union movement before 1980			0
@entity7 believed @entity45 had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between @entity7 and @entity47 , but @entity7 was the only one who showed up for the meeting , according to the @entity110			0
@entity45 and @entity47 later told the @entity110 that no meeting had been scheduled			0
the @entity110 said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to @entity7 's efforts to regain power in the @entity50 and the mob 's influence over the union 's pension funds			1
@entity120 and the @entity110 have searched for @entity7 intermittently			0
in september 2001 , the @entity110 found dna that linked @entity7 to a car that agents suspected was used in his disappearance			1
in 2004 , authorities removed floorboards from a @entity12 home to look for traces of blood , as former @entity50 official @entity130 claimed in a biography that he had shot @entity7			1
two years later , the @entity110 razed a horse barn in @entity1 following what it called " a fairly credible lead			1
" urban lore long suggested that @entity7 was buried around the end zone at the former @entity137 in @entity52			2
@entity2 's @entity138 and @entity139 contributed to this report .			0
