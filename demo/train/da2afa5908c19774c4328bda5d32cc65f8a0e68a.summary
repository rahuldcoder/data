" the man responsible for @entity3 pretending the @entity4 have n't started yet is @entity28 , " read one post from friday referring to the network , which has exclusive broadcast rights to the @entity4 in the @entity26			2
" tell him what u think ! " that post then listed @entity28 's e-mail address			1
@entity11 did n't notice any repercussions until he checked his account sunday , he said			0
" when i logged on , i was presented with a message saying it had been ' suspended , ' " @entity11 wrote in a post for the @entity36			1
" if i had any questions , i was asked to click on a link and fill in an online form			0
" [ monday ] morning , i heard back from @entity5			0
in what was apparently an automated e-mail , i was told that : ' your @entity5 account has been suspended for posting an individual 's private information such as private e-mail address			1
' it then contained a copy of my tweet regarding mr. @entity28			0
" @entity5 spokeswoman @entity51 said the company does n't " comment on individual users for privacy reasons			0
" @entity5 's terms of use forbid posting other people 's personal information			1
the site says it does n't monitor tweets but investigates if a user complains that they 've been affected			0

" we filed a complaint with @entity5 because a user tweeted the personal information of one of our executives , " the company said in a written statement			2
" according to @entity5 , this is a violation of their privacy policy			0
" opinion : is it really # @entity77 ? @entity5 does say that posting information that 's already been published online does n't violate its terms			2
some people critical of the move say that should have saved @entity11 , because a web search for @entity28 's e-mail address will turn it up			1
as @entity88 's @entity87 writes , however , it 's not easily found , and it is featured most prominently on an @entity90 petition			0
@entity5 and @entity91 have a partnership during the @entity4 through which the social media service is collecting tweets from athletes and fans and displaying them all on one page			0
@entity11 has used @entity5 and his articles to fire withering criticism at @entity3 over how it has handled @entity101 coverage			1
in tweets that have since been deleted , he accused @entity3 of " disgusting money grabbing " and called the company " utter , utter bastards			0
" live or later : what 's your ideal @entity4 coverage ? many users have taken to @entity5 to speak against his suspension , saying it appears linked to his critiques			1
" the @entity11 @entity5 ban illustrates three tendencies of hegemonic power ; 1 ) hates criticism , 2 ) takes itself seriously 3 ) no sense of fun , " posted @entity121 novelist @entity120 , the author of " trainspotting			2
" others , though , noted that the posting of @entity28 's e-mail makes it a somewhat murkier question			2
" if criticizing @entity3 over how it 's handled the @entity101 coverage were cause for suspension @entity5 would pretty much be empty right about now , " wrote tech industry analyst @entity127 .			1
