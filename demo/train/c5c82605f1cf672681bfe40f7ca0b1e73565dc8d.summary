triumph in a survivor - meets - gladiator teen war to the death			2
how did the stoic archeress from @entity11 win the " @entity12 " ? by making herself over into a lethally clever ( but never murderous ) scamp of the woods			2
now it 's out of the frying pan and into the even hungrier games			2
in " @entity4 : catching @entity24 , " @entity7 has become a star , a lightning - rod symbol of the early stirrings of a people 's rebellion			1
but she 's still the superwarrior girl next door ; she wears her rebel impulses lightly , if not politely			2
@entity0 : ' @entity12 ' coverage on a @entity11 of the 12 districts , she and her fellow champion , @entity28 ( @entity29 ) , have to carry on the charade that they 're in love , and the first sign of @entity7 ' insurrectionary fever is that she 's not very good at faking it			1
( or maybe it 's just that @entity29 , with his captain - of - the - cricket - team geek hunkitude , is n't much of an inspiration			0
) as the two speak , rebel miscreants are subdued by stormtroopers , and the crowds just get angrier			0
so the ruling powers , led by the velvet - voiced fascist president @entity47 ( @entity49 ) , figure it 's time to nip @entity7 — and the rebellion — in the bud with the @entity53 , a special , once - every - 25 - years edition of the @entity4 in which past winners compete against each other			1
in other words : it 's all badasses			0
up on stage with @entity62 's purple - eyebrowed , gleaming - white - smiled @entity63 — the @entity64 of @entity65 — katniss shows off her wedding gown , and the outfit burns down to reveal a stunning black @entity70 dress			0
it 's the revolution as fashion statement — a wink to the masses watching her on tv			0
but in the presidential lair , @entity77 ( @entity78 ) , the sinister @entity4 designer , predicts that the blood sport to come will squelch her popularity			0
he smirks , '' let 's watch her get her hands dirty ! '' @entity0 : @entity88 talks ' @entity86 ' yet @entity89 does not get her hands dirty			1
she competes in ruthless kill - or - be - killed contests using her speed and wits , but she never has to do anything too ugly or brutal — or , for my money , too surprising			0
there 's a ritualistic quality to these films that 's key to their appeal , but it also limits their capacity to truly wow us			0
" @entity86 " is more energized than the first " @entity12 " movie ; it 's been directed , by @entity106 ( @entity107 ) , with a darkly sustained verve			1
the @entity53 is more openly a contest between @entity7 and the @entity11 powers , and in its gimmicky way it 's more gripping — a lethal jungle fun house , with @entity7 and her allies facing down a toxic fog , a vicious tribe of baboons , even the arena itself			1
as newcomer @entity119 , @entity118 delivers her lines with a scene - stealing screw - it - all nastiness , and @entity125 nails the role of the wicked - smart former champion @entity127			1
as for @entity106 , she more than holds her own , turning her face into a dreamy - pale @entity130 mask			0
you react to every wave of sadness and fury roiling around inside @entity7 , even when @entity7 is n't allowed to show it			1
" @entity86 " is smoothly exciting but a bit of a tease			2
it gets mileage out of setting up the @entity53 as some ultimate fear factor version of @entity141 , yet there is n't a moment of real dread in it			1
the film also sets up @entity7 , with her sizzling ( in every way ) costumes and goth - @entity150 makeup , as the feral face of revolt , but the cliff - hanger finale reveals that she is , thus far , a passive agent in this revolution			1
@entity106 plays her as a riveting icon of girl power , but i hope that in the upcoming sequels , @entity7 gets to show another dimension or two to go along with her precocious , defiant strength			2

@entity7 has become a star in " @entity86 "
newcomer @entity118 as @entity119 is a scene stealer
the film gets mileage out of setting up the @entity53
