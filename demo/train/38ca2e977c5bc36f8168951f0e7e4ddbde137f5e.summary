-- you may remember the episode of " @entity3 " in which @entity4 struggles to find a way to break up with the woman he 's dating without hurting her feelings			2
" it 's not you , " he tells her			2
" after decades of saying gay people were depraved and deviant , a bunch of dangerous predators out to recruit children and destroy families , in the last few years those opposed to equal rights for gay people have retreated to a very different message			2
it 's not you , they tell gay @entity25			1
it 's true that you can still find some people on the fringe who will rail against homosexuality as an inherent evil			2
but watch the mainstream debate , from newspapers to television to the @entity39 , and what you see are conservatives arguing that the problem is n't gay people themselves , it 's how straight people are affected by them			1
five things we learned from the arguments opponents of gay marriage want everyone to know that they are n't motivated by bigotry , only by a concern for straight people with tender feelings and fragile marriages			1
we saw this at the @entity39 on wednesday , when chief justice @entity57 tried to argue that the 1996 @entity58 was n't actually motivated by any disapproval of gay people			1
he seemed incredulous at the very idea when it was brought up by the attorneys seeking to overturn @entity58			0
" so that was the view of the 84 senators who voted in favor of it and the president who signed it ? " he asked repeatedly			0
" they were motivated by animus ? " opinion : chief justice reveals he 's fed up with @entity73 the chief justice has a short memory			1
back in 1996 , those pushing for @entity58 were quite forthright about what they thought about gay people			0
" i come from a district in @entity83 who has very profound beliefs that homosexuality is wrong , " said @entity78 , now a @entity79 and then a member of the @entity81			0
" what they believe is , is that homosexuality is immoral , that it is based on perversion , that it is based on lust ... we hear about diversity , but we do not hear about perversity			0
" his @entity83 colleague @entity95 said , " no culture that has ever embraced homosexuality has survived			0
" during oral arguments in the @entity58 case , justice @entity99 read from a 1996 @entity103 report on the bill , which said in part , " civil laws that permit only heterosexual marriage reflect and honor a collective moral judgment about human sexuality			0
this judgment entails both moral disapproval of homosexuality , and a moral conviction that heterosexuality better comports with traditional ( especially @entity116 ) morality			0
" that kind of rhetoric was common in 1996 , but you do n't hear it coming from members of @entity121 much anymore			0
why should n't gay people be allowed to serve openly in the military ? the answer , they say , is n't because gay soldiers , sailors , airmen and marines wo n't do their jobs well			1
it 's because the straight ones will feel uncomfortable if they have to be in close quarters with gay comrades			1
it 's not about gay service members ' performance , it 's about the feelings of straight service members ( and if you 're wondering why we have n't heard too much about the end of " @entity138 , " it 's because it turned out that straight military personnel could handle it just fine )			1
opinion : bigotry drags marriage back to @entity39 the marriage debate has followed the same course			1
opponents of gay rights used to argue that gay people were promiscuous and sexually debauched			1
but when it turned out that many of them just want to join in stable , permanent family commitments , that argument no longer made much sense			0
so now opponents say the problem is n't the gay marriages themselves , it 's the effect those marriages will have on straight marriages			1
what , in particular , will that effect be ? opponents of marriage equality are having difficulty saying , but it seems they believe that if marriage is " devalued " by being open to gay couples , straight people will start ignoring their children , cheating on one another and getting divorced			1
opinion : is 2013 the ' @entity171 ' ? here again , they have retreated to ground that is increasingly difficult to defend			0
they now argue that the only real purpose of marriage is to rear children biologically related to both parents , a rather pinched definition			1
when @entity99 asked during oral arguments on @entity183 whether , if that was the case , it would be constitutional for a state to ban anyone over 55 from being married , the attorney defending the initiative said no , because marriages between older heterosexuals still foster " the marital norm , which imposes the obligations of fidelity and monogamy , " which " make it less likely that either party to that marriage will engage in irresponsible procreative conduct outside of that marriage			0
" in other words , existing marriage laws discourage people from cheating on their spouses , but if you let gay people get married , the whole country will turn into an episode of " @entity205 , " with husbands and wives jumping in and out of their neighbors ' beds willy - nilly			2
opinion : how gay rights went mainstream if that sounds ridiculous to you , you 're absolutely right			2
but that 's where " it 's not you , it 's me " eventually leads			0
if you want to argue that gay rights have to be restricted because of how heterosexuals will react , then you end up saying not only that straight people are frightened of gays and ready to abandon their spouses at the slightest provocation , but that those personal feelings and weaknesses deserve legal protection			1
at this point , that 's about all opponents of gay rights have left			1
they do n't want to sound like bigots , so they 've almost stopped talking about gay people entirely			2
it 's not you , they say , it 's us			0
well , they 're right about that			0
just maybe not in the way they think			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			2

@entity241 : opponents of marriage equality say they are n't motivated by bigotry
@entity241 : they argue that gay marriage may *adversely* affect straight marriage
he says in the military , for example , the end of " @entity138 " did n't cause problems
@entity241 : the " it 's not you , it 's me " argument is ridiculous and all opponents have left
