and , for some strange reason , they think @entity5 has them			2
@entity5 , in this case , is the creator of the @entity9 app. @entity5 , who told @entity0 via email he does n't want his full name used out of privacy concerns , says he originally wrote the eponymous app as a way for his friends to get in touch with him			1
it was a simple , novel idea that spiraled into something much bigger and more bizarre than that			0
his friends started turning other friends onto it , then their friends found out and so on			2
it 's gotten so popular that @entity5 says the app gets more than one download per minute			1
he says his first email from someone he genuinely did n't know was from an anonymous girl saying she was a " princess from @entity30			0
" they had a fantastical exchange about dwarves and love , and it signified to @entity5 the moment when the app had truly gotten out in the wild			2
" i thought there was something magical about the whole crazy conversation i had with a random person , " he said			0
turns out , people liked the idea of silly , light - hearted conversations with a seemingly nice stranger			0
@entity5 does n't mind answering , and enjoyed chatting up these strangers , so he released @entity47 to the public			1
however , @entity5 decided some ground rules were in order , which include : - @entity5 ca n't respond when he 's asleep - no emergency messages - do n't ask @entity5 to do your work - do n't fall in love with @entity5 now , people @entity5 has never met are depending on him to help them address the minor conundrums of life : this dress or that one ? @entity59 or @entity60 ? stay home or work out ? due to the attention , some people have even started pushing @entity5 to see if he could build them their own app. it 's possibly the next step in social software : from everyone on the same app to everyone with his or her own app. as for @entity5 , he recently crossed a new threshold : he 'd been answering every question but finally succumbed to sleep and could n't get to them all			1
which may have led to another rule for users of the app : " be patient			0

@entity47 began as a way for @entity5 to stay in touch with friends
strangers started downloading the app and asking questions
@entity5 now personally answers life 's little *quandaries*
