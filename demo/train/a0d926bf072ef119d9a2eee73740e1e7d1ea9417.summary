-- at first glance , it seems the graffiti revolution that descended on the @entity4 in the wake of the @entity6 has largely bypassed @entity7			1
the city 's public transport -- usually an irresistible canvas for taggers -- remains remarkably glistening			2
the walls of the city 's myriad new builds are unmarred by aerosol sketches			0
@entity16 indoors , however , and you 're likely to find a different story			0
club nights often feature live graffiti demos by local artists ; restaurants tap writers to mark up their walls ; brands commission the city 's street artists to emblazon their brand on a variety of spaces			1
" @entity7 is bonkers for it at the minute , " says @entity31 , a local street artist who , along with his wife @entity32 , has become the go - to writer for many local and global corporations			1
this summer , @entity36 recruited the pair to collaborate in their @entity39 campaign			0
" we get contacted to do projects all the time , though we 've not once advertised , " says @entity40 , who reasons that the trend is born out of @entity7 's @entity43 - loving youth culture			1
the duo , who operate as @entity47 , grew up tagging around @entity48			2
they argue that the corporate slant of their work is necessitated both by their compulsion to do graffiti and @entity7 's inhospitable street art environment			1
@entity7 's @entity57 says the penalty is a fine , which doubles every time a perpetrator is caught			1
if a enough of a writer 's tags are identified around the city , that could add up to a hefty sum			0
" @entity7 is so clean			1
when i first got here , graffiti was the first thing i wanted to do , " admits one			2
" but it 's not worth doing anything illegal in @entity7 , because it 's not worth the hassle			1
you 'd get away with it in the @entity75 , but here , it 's such a small scene , [ the police ] would soon find out who it was			0
" though @entity31 says the restrictions of painting corporate murals " does my head in , " @entity40 thinks it has a positive side			0
" it gives us a platform to show @entity7 what graffiti is all about ; it 's not just vandalism , " she says			1

@entity40 offers workshops to school children , and the pair has set up a wall in their back yard , where local and visiting street artists are invited to scrawl whatever they like			1
@entity7 's galleries have also started courting the world 's street artists in hopes of lending @entity7 a little extra color			1
@entity109 , a local arts organization , recently invited @entity112 graffiti writer @entity111 over as part of a one - year residency			1
@entity111 also says he 'd rather work within @entity7 's legal framework than incur the wrath of the authorities			1
" of course , i 've had the temptation , " he says			0
" you need that rush			0
" @entity111 's @entity123 - meets - @entity122 murals have cropped up around the city , though he says he 's sought approval from both the local government and individual property owners			2
" the first time i asked for permission it felt weird , " he admits			2
" i never used to ask permission			0
i would just paint and maybe say sorry afterward			0
" while @entity111 does n't object to the @entity47 ' corporate approach , he maintains it 's not for him			0
" i understand why they do it -- artists have to pay the bills			2
i respect it , but personally , i just do n't feel comfortable doing that kind of thing			0
" the handful of the city 's unsanctioned street artists feel even more conflicted about corporate sponsorship of graffiti			1
" i wish people would stop relying on brands and companies to sponsor their intentions , and just get out there and do their own thing independently , without any interference , " says 8 , aka @entity146 , an anonymous stencil artist whose work has started appearing in one of the city 's residential neighborhoods			0
@entity158 is one of a small handful of writers who make up @entity7 's landscape without seeking permission first			1
perhaps the city 's most notable unsanctioned street artist , however , is @entity166 , whose style is to drop socially pointed text on @entity7 's temporary architecture			1

" though @entity166 declined to comment , one can assume the use of temporary space is to avoid possibly messy legal repercussions			0
for the most part , his work has drawn positive feedback from many of the city 's other artists			2
" i really like his stuff , " concedes @entity111			0
" he 's been writing his pretty intense codes all over the city for years			0
" " he is the street artist who has inspired me most , " says @entity146			2
" i have great respect for his work , which is very interesting to say the least			0

in @entity7 , no *product* *launch* or ' it ' opening is complete without a live graffiti demo .
corporations are also *clamoring* to hire local street artists to give their brand ' edge ' .
fines for graffiti double every time a perpetrator is caught .
many street artists operate either legally , or *quasi-legally* .
