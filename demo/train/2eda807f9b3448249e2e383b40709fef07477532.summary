" the allegations are spiraling through @entity17 , a small town of 36,000 people in northwest @entity3			1
the case has come to light just days after two teenage football players in @entity22 , @entity23 , were found guilty of raping a 16 - year - old girl in an incident involving disturbing , boastful text messages and a series of social media attacks against the accuser			2
now @entity17 is thrust into the national spotlight , becoming a new focal point for worries over teenage sex , rape and the use of social media to alternately attack both the alleged victim and the accused the @entity17 cases are very different from @entity22 , however			1
" what we 're dealing with here is an age difference , " lt. @entity39 , commander of the @entity40 , told @entity0			0
" if it was a one - year age difference ... there would have been no crime			0
" how do i raise a boy not to be a rapist ? @entity3 law makes it illegal for a teenager to have sex with a minor more than three years younger than him or her			1
" these victims knew the arrestees , they were friends with them , " and they were involved in the encounters " voluntarily , although it was still wrong , " @entity39 said			2
it was " consensual " in the sense that there was not an attack but was illegal because by law , a 13 - year - old is too young to give consent , he said			1
@entity69 and @entity70 , both 18 , are charged with sexual assault , risk of injury to a minor and illegal contact with a child , prosecutor @entity68 told @entity0			1
the alleged offenses occurred in early february			2
@entity77 also faces similar charges in an alleged earlier incident in january involving one of the two alleged victims			1

" the young men have not made a public statement			2
an attorney for @entity77 declined to comment			0
@entity70 's attorney , @entity88 , said his client denies all charges against him			0
@entity70 is being held in jail pending trial because his mother can not afford to post bond , @entity88 said			0
" we pleaded not guilty , and we asked for a jury trial , " @entity88 said			0
" we deny anything occurred ; we deny all allegations			0
" @entity100 senior @entity99 told @entity0 affiliate @entity101 that @entity77 and @entity70 are " the coolest guys ever			0
they 're not all that bad			0
all this stuff is getting pulled out of proportion			0
" opinion : in @entity22 , why did n't other girls help ? a 17 - year - old boy has also been charged in an alleged incident last fall , police said			1
because he is a minor , authorities have not released information about him			2
authorities have not released many details because the cases remain under seal			0
@entity39 explained how the case began : the family of one of the alleged victims learned of the encounter and reported it to police			1
that sparked an investigation , which led to police discovering that two 18 - year - olds had allegedly sexually assaulted two 13 - year - old girls , and that one of those girls had also allegedly been sexually assaulted by a 17 - year - old boy last fall			1
attacked on twitter after word broke of the case in february , some people , many of them fellow teens , began vicious attacks , particularly against the girl whose parents had gone to the police			1
" i wan na know why there 's no punishment for young hoes , " one person tweeted			0
" young girls acting like whores there 's no punishment for that young men acting like boys is a sentence , " another tweeted			2
" i hope you got what you wanted , " wrote another			0
one tweet accused her of having " snitched			2
" the local newspaper , @entity160 , archived images of tweets before many were taken down			0
" even if it was all his fault , what was a 13 year old girl doing hanging around with 18 year old guys , " tweeted one girl , whose @entity134 handle seemed to no longer be active thursday			1
she later tweeted that she was misunderstood			0
healing process after rape never ends one boy tweeted that he is the cousin of the girl who wrote that tweet , and that some people on @entity134 were " threatening to kill " her for what she wrote			1
@entity88 , @entity70 's attorney , said his client had no knowledge of the @entity134 traffic , has had no access to computers and has had no visitors who could have informed him			1
" i find it interesting that the accused 's name is published but not the accuser 's , " @entity88 said			2
" but that 's the law , and i have every intention of respecting and obeying the law , and my client has every intention of respecting and obeying the law as well			0
" he 's more concerned with moving forward with the trial , being exonerated and putting this behind him , " @entity88 said			0
