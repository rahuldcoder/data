-- @entity1 returns to golf on thursday insisting he is ready to win and has no regrets over firing his long - time caddie @entity4			1
the former world number one has been out of action since may with a knee injury but is preparing to make his long - awaited comeback at the @entity9 on thursday			1
he will do so without @entity4 , who was on his bag for 13 of his 14 major wins			1
instead , friend @entity12 will be on caddie duty until @entity1 can find a full time replacement for the @entity15 , who reacted to the split by claiming he had " wasted two years of my life " while @entity1 was engulfed in a sex scandal and battled to find his best form			1
" that 's what he says and what he feels , " @entity1 told a press conference			1
" i felt it was time for a change			0
i felt that @entity29 and i have had an amazing run -- @entity29 's an amazing caddie			2
" he 's helped my career , and i think i 've helped his as well			0
we won a bunch of tournaments , but i just felt like it was time to change things up a little bit			0
" i feel comfortable with the move and i 've got @entity12 on the bag this week			1
@entity12 and i go way back -- we 're very comfortable on the course together			1
i do n't have a permanent caddie , but we 'll see going forward			2
" @entity1 said he had informed @entity4 of his decision during a " man - to - man " conversation after the @entity45 tournament in early july			1
the 35 - year - old said his new caddie would have to be someone who could handle the spotlight and revealed his vacancy had attracted plenty of applications -- not all of them desirable			2
" caddies out here [ on tour ] -- a few have applied			0
people who are not caddies out here -- a ton , " @entity1 joked			1
" we 've had a lot of ... interesting ones			0
" [ i 'll be looking for ] someone that understands the game and can handle the pressure , of coming down the stretch on the back nine on sunday			0
someone who has been there before , can understand it and deal with that			0
" @entity1 claims the work he has put in with coach @entity75 is starting to benefit his game as he prepares to swing his first club in anger since pulling out of the @entity79 on may 12			1
he added : " i have been hitting more solid than i have in the past			0
some of the things i 'm working with @entity75 are starting to make sense			0
i can see what he 's trying to get me to do			0
" i 've had some good practice sessions of late and just need to tee it up and do it on thursday			2
i 'm here to try and win a golf tournament			2
i 'm just focused on that			0
