@entity0 -- tuesday is the biggest single day of primary voting this year , with eight states holding contests from coast to coast			2
once again , there 's a high - profile tea party vs. mainstream @entity9 primary showdown			1
the election , in @entity10 , is the anti-establishment 's best shot at ousting an incumbent @entity15 senator running for re-election this year			1
in @entity19 , the front - runner in the @entity9 @entity9 primary has rare support from both sides in this intra-party battle			2
if @entity15 can flip @entity19 and five other @entity25 - held seats , they will regain control of the @entity9			2
and keep an eye on @entity28 , which becomes the largest state in the country to hold an open , or " jungle " primary , where the top two finishers advance to the november election , regardless of party affiliation			1
here are five contests worth watching on tuesday : 1			0
a big test for the tea party : for tea party supporters , the @entity9 @entity9 primary in @entity10 represents perhaps their most high - profile chance to claim victory after facing a string of defeats this year			1
with the exception of some races in @entity48 last week , conservative challengers have lost in key congressional contests , including in @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			0
polls in @entity10 show the @entity9 race there will go down to the wire			1
at 76 , @entity59 is the second oldest @entity9 incumbent running for re-election this year			2
state sen. @entity61 says @entity59 's six terms in @entity0 are enough and he 's running on a platform of change for @entity10			1
" we do n't have six more years of the status quo , " he told @entity1 's @entity65			2
" i am not going to @entity0 , to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals			0
i 'm going up there to fight and defend the @entity71			0
" cochran supporters argue the senator knows what 's best for the state , and they point to @entity61 's out - of - state help			2
former gov. @entity77 blasted @entity61 for bringing in " outside celebrities " such as former @entity80 sen. @entity79 and former @entity82 gov. @entity81 , who campaigned for @entity61 in the past week			2
new ads in nasty @entity85 race @entity59 was considered the most vulnerable @entity9 senator facing re-election			0
but momentum shifted after questions arose about the @entity61 campaign 's knowledge of a bizarre plan to shoot pictures of @entity59 's ailing wife in a nursing home bed			0
nasty @entity9 race digs deeper into the mud 2			0
both sides in the bag : @entity101 sen. @entity100 does n't have to take sides in the battle between grass - roots conservatives and the @entity15 establishment : she 's got the backing of both			1
@entity108 , a lieutenant colonel in the @entity109 who grabbed national attention earlier this year by touting her hog castrating skills in a campaign commercial , has the support of some top names and groups among both the tea party movement and the mainstream @entity9			1
a @entity119 poll released over the weekend put @entity108 at 36 % , 18 percentage points ahead of businessman @entity121			0
if no candidate cracks 35 % of the vote , the nomination will be decided by around 2,000 delegates at a state party convention			1
the @entity9 nominee will face off in november against @entity25 rep. @entity128 , who faces token opposition in his party 's primary			1
the winner of november 's general election will succeed longtime @entity25 sen. @entity134 , who is retiring at the end of the year			1
@entity15 feel they have a good shot at flipping @entity134 's seat in their drive to retake the @entity9			0
big name republicans from both establishment and conservative wings of the party like @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity81 have joined @entity108 on the trail and she 's gotten support from establishment groups like the @entity149 as well groups like the @entity151 , which often backs conservative candidates who launch primary challenges against incumbent @entity15 senators			1
@entity108 has backing from both sides 3			0
the battle for second : no one is questioning whether @entity160 @entity159 , who 's bidding for an unprecedented fourth term as @entity28 governor , is the overwhelming favorite in tuesday 's @entity28 primary			1
the big question is whom the incumbent will face come november			1
for the first time in statewide races , @entity28 is holding " open " or " jungle " primaries , in which all candidates compete in a single contest and the first and second place finishers , regardless of party affiliation , advance to the general election			1
so , who will be @entity159 's opponent in november ? the latest polling indicates former @entity182 administration treasury official @entity181 is slightly ahead of state rep. @entity183 for the second spot			1
both are @entity15 but which candidate advances to november could make a difference for the party 's chances in the general election			1
some @entity9 strategists said they 're concerned that if it 's @entity183 , a conservative with tea party backing , it could hurt @entity15 candidates in down - ballot races in a state where the general election electorate is much more moderate than that of the @entity9 primary			1
but wait , there 's more			0
one time anti-war protester @entity201 is also on the ballot , the nomine of the @entity204 , a socialist party whose gubernatorial candidates have traditionally grabbed about 1 % of the vote			0
@entity208 became the face of the anti-iraq war movement in 2005 when she protested for weeks outside then - president @entity182 's ranch in @entity212 , @entity48 , after her son @entity213 was killed in combat			2
a very , very crowded primary : a new - age spiritual healer			0
those are just four of the 16 candidates running in the primary for @entity28 's 33rd @entity223 , which includes @entity224			1
the district also contains parts of @entity227 , as well as the opulent cities of @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231			0
the area is losing its longtime congressman , democrat @entity233 , who announced earlier this year he would retire at the end of his 20th term			0
keeping up with the celebrity endorsements and the money race in this part of the state can be a challenge			2
@entity241 , the self - help guru , has the backing of @entity244 and @entity245 , for example			0
@entity227 city controller @entity247 and state sen. @entity248 , both @entity25 , are considered the most likely candidates to place in the top two and advance to the general election			2
but with just as many @entity15 and independents as @entity25 running for the seat -- and an expected low turnout -- it 's possible the race may not end up as an intra-party fight			1
wild battle to represent @entity229 5			0
@entity160 incumbent challenged in @entity259 : @entity15 view @entity259 as another chance to pick up a @entity25 seat and regain control of the @entity9			2
the incumbent , democrat @entity263 , was appointed to the seat in february after longtime sen. @entity265 resigned to become @entity267 ambassador to @entity268			0
@entity269 faces two @entity25 primary challengers , rancher @entity271 and former lt. gov. @entity272			1
@entity269 is considered the front - runner and political observers will watch to see how big -- or how small -- his margin is over his competitors			0
if he fails to win by a landslide , it could spell trouble in the fall			0
the @entity25 nominee will face the winner of the @entity9 race -- another three - way contest -- in november			1
rep. @entity287 is considered the favorite in the @entity9 primary and has the support of the @entity291			0
he faces state rep. @entity292 and political newcomer @entity293 .			0

what has been the country 's nastiest primary is to be decided in @entity10
@entity300 candidate has backing from both tea party and establishment republicans
only question for @entity28 gov. @entity159 is who he *'ll* face in november
@entity25 incumbent in @entity309 race gets challenge from within
