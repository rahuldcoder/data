@entity0 , @entity1 -- the wounds of partition festered again this week in @entity1 , resulting in the banning of a book and the expulsion of a respected politician			1
protesters burn an effigy of @entity11 over his book ; the former foreign minister was ousted from his party			2
the home state of the father of @entity1 independence , @entity16 , forbade the sale and circulation of a new book it says spews revisionist history about the birth of secular but predominantly @entity23 and the @entity24 of @entity25			1
written by @entity11 , a former federal minister and senior member of the @entity23 nationalist @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , the book calls @entity29 , considered by @entity1 the architect of the partition , a great man who is wrongly demonized			1
@entity29 went on to become the first governor general of @entity25			1
in " @entity29 : @entity1 , @entity40 and @entity41 , " @entity11 absolves the @entity25 leader as the man responsible for dividing the subcontinent , suggesting instead that it was another beloved independence leader , @entity37 , who played a major role			1
" the book wrongfully portrays the fateful partition of our nation , " the @entity43 state government said in a statement			1
" such a brainchild has no historic background at all			0
in the larger interest of society , the state government has decided to impose a ban on the book			1
" the @entity28 accused @entity11 of deviating from the party 's " core ideology "			0
" we always respect freedom of expression but can never compromise our ideology , " @entity56 , a party spokesman , told @entity2			0
" you just ca n't eulogize @entity29 and accuse @entity37 instead			2
" @entity11 , a widely respected politician known for his moderate views within the ranks of a conservative party , found it appalling that freedom of expression was threatened in the world 's largest democracy			0
" the day we start banning books , we are banning thinking , " @entity11 told reporters			0
he defended his work and said he did not understand the objection to his writings about @entity37 , who , as @entity1 's first home minister , banned the @entity23 revivalist @entity76 , the mother organization of the @entity28 , after the assassination of @entity16 in 1948			1
" i do n't know which part of the core belief i have demolished , " @entity11 said			0
nearly 350 years of @entity82 rule ended in 1947 when an agreement for independence was reached to give @entity85 their own homeland			0
@entity1 think of @entity29 as the man who pushed a two - state notion based on religion as a prerequisite for freedom			1
in the days that followed , an estimated 1 million people died in a border - crossing exodus			0
@entity85 fled from @entity1 into @entity25 while @entity95 clamored to find new homes in @entity1			1
the animosities fueled by that bloody birth -- including three wars fought by @entity1 and @entity25 over the disputed territory of @entity101 -- continue to haunt @entity1 , said journalist and author @entity102			1
" this flashpoint played out in public is a reminder of those wounds , " @entity102 said of the book dispute			0
as a book of history written by a politician , it might have been inconsequential , @entity102 said			2
but as a book about the partition , it was incendiary			2
" what happened 62 years ago continues to haunt us in a very bitter way , " @entity102 said			0
" we ca n't seem to leave our baggage in the past			0
" this is n't the first time that @entity25 's founder has caused trouble for a @entity23 nationalist			2
@entity28 president @entity126 was forced to temporarily step down in 2005 for praising @entity29 's secularism during a trip to @entity25			2
political observers say the @entity11 controversy reflects a battle for the soul of the @entity28 , beleaguered by electoral defeats and vicious infighting			0
many in @entity1 view the @entity28 as a divisive force attempting to gain power by exploiting @entity23 - @entity85 tensions			1
@entity126 was charged in the 1992 demolition of the 16th - century @entity141 mosque in the central @entity1 city of @entity143 , though he was later acquitted in that case			1
journalist @entity145 , a longtime observer of conservative politics in @entity1 , said the @entity28 is struggling to figure out how to stay electable , whether to move right or stay closer to the center			2
" @entity11 's book is a manifestation of that clash , " @entity145 said			0
@entity11 's political climb is likely over , but what of younger @entity1 , now generations removed from those who remember independence ? @entity102 for one , senses the wounds could keep reopening			1
and that , he said , " does n't bode well			0
