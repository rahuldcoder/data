-- talk about a longevity strategy no man wants to pursue			0
a recent study published in the journal @entity5 finds that @entity8 eunuchs â € ” castrated men â € ” lived 14 to 19 years longer than other men , suggesting that male sex hormones play a role in life span			1
in the study , the researchers used a genealogy record called the @entity17 that tracked eunuchs who worked in the @entity8 imperial court during the @entity20 , which ruled from the 14th to early 20th centuries			1
researchers were able to identify 81 eunuchs , who were castrated as boys , and determined that they lived to an average age of 70 , significantly longer than other men of similar social status			1
even kings did n't typically make it to age 50			0
three of the 81 eunuchs lived to 100 , a centenarian rate that 's far higher than would be expected in modern society			2
the current incidence of centenarians is 1 per 3,500 people in @entity37 , and 1 per 4,400 people in the @entity42 , for instance ; thus , the incidence of centenarians among @entity8 eunuchs was at least 130 times higher than that of present - day developed countries , according to the paper			1
@entity0 : want to live longer ? do n't try caloric restriction " our study supports the idea that male sex hormones decrease the lifespan of men , " the authors write			1
based on earlier research , the authors argue that one explanation for this could be that male sex hormones may negatively influence the immune system and " predispose men to adverse cardiovascular attacks			1
" they note further that the theory helps explain why females -- in many species -- live longer than males			0
but while animal studies have suggested that castration ( which removes the testes , the source of male hormones ) results in longer lives , studies in humans have been spotty			1
in one study of castrati singers , there was no difference in lifespan between them and non-castrated singers ; in another study of institutionalized , mentally ill men , however , those who were castrated lived some 14 years longer than those who were n't			1
and there are other reasons that women may outlive men , including for example the presence of estrogen , which may help enhance longevity			2
also , as @entity95 reports : " females may have an advantage in longevity because they have a back - up x chromosome , ( dr. l. @entity99 , a co-founder of the @entity100 , ) said			0
a woman 's body is a mixture of cells , half containing an active x chromosome from her mother and the other half from her father , he said			0
if there is a defect on one x chromosome , half of her cells will be unaffected			0
" @entity0 : health checkup : how to live 100 years further , the longevity of the @entity8 eunuchs could be attributable to lifestyle factors the study did n't track , like diet , exercise and stress			1
the authors think the men 's long lives ca n't be chalked up solely to a privileged lifestyle , however			2
" except for a few eunuchs , most lived outside the palace and spent time inside the palace only when they were on duty , " study author @entity127 of @entity128 told @entity129			1
meanwhile , they still tended to outlive other royalty who spent their whole lives inside the palace			0
obviously , the study authors do n't advocate becoming a eunuch			2
there are more sensible and reliable ways to up your chances of a long , healthy life : do n't smoke , eat a healthy diet , get plenty of exercise			2
" for better health and longevity , stay away from stresses and learn what you can from women , " the authors said in a statement			0
@entity0 : too good to be true ? anti-aging proteins not so potent after all this article was originally published on @entity0			0

a study analyzed the lifespan of @entity8 eunuchs during the @entity20
the eunuchs outlived the other men by 14 to 19 years
the findings suggest male sex hormones play a role in life span
