@entity0 , @entity1 -- floodwaters brought by @entity4 began to recede monday in parts of @entity1 , but the governor warned that further flooding and loss of life are likely ahead for the small , rural state			1
" it 's just devastating , " gov. @entity11 said monday			1
" @entity14 communities under water , businesses , homes , obviously roads and bridges , rail transportation infrastructure			1
we 've lost farmers ' crops , " he said			0
" we 're tough folks up here but @entity26 ... really hit us hard			0
" hundreds of people remained trapped monday in communities cut off by raging floodwaters that washed out or otherwise damaged 263 roads and bridges , @entity11 said			1
exactly how many were stranded remained unclear , he said			0
" it 's hard for us to know , frankly , because it 's hard for us to get into the communities we need to get to , " he said			2
highlighting the transportation problems , the @entity36 had to travel through neighboring @entity38 to get rescue crews to the small , cut - off town of @entity41 , the governor said			1
three deaths had been confirmed as a result of the storm			0
a woman who was standing near the @entity46 in @entity41 died after she was swept away by floodwaters			2
her body was recovered , according to authorities			0
also , a male was killed in @entity51 after being swept away by floodwaters , according to @entity53			2
another male was found dead in @entity56 in @entity57 earlier monday , authorities said			2
@entity11 said monday afternoon that authorities were searching for another missing person			1
images of the flooding showed normally tranquil streams pouring through city streets and thrashing against buildings and bridges , including some of the state 's iconic covered bridges			1
four to six of the covered bridges were destroyed in the flooding , officials said			0
even the state emergency management headquarters in @entity73 flooded sunday night , forcing officials to evacuate to @entity75 , about 20 miles away			2
" the storm essentially shut southern @entity1 down , " said state police capt. @entity76			1
" president @entity80 signed a disaster declaration for the state on monday , allowing federal aid to the state			1
@entity86 administrator @entity85 planned to tour flooded communities in @entity1 on tuesday , according to the @entity88			1
no specifics of @entity85 's trip were given			2
the governor described conditions as " probably the toughest flooding that we 've seen in the state of @entity1 in our history			1
" " you 've got to remember that @entity1 is a lot of beautiful mountains with valleys and small brooks that run into bigger rivers , " @entity11 said on @entity2 's " @entity97 with @entity98			1
" " our small brooks have crested ( but ) our larger rivers have not -- so we know there 's more trouble ahead			1
" @entity109 lives in @entity110 , @entity1 , along the @entity111			1
her home is on a hill , so the only damages she suffered were a washed - out driveway and a " small river running through our backyard			0
" but many others in the area were not so fortunate , @entity109 said monday after taking a walking tour of the area			0
she saw washed - out roads , farm fields covered in silt and other damage			2
she said she knows some houses were swept away , as well			0
" the massive amounts of damage caused by water is so unbelievable , and until you see it you would not believe it , " she said			0
" there are so many farmers whose fields are beyond repair , and are losing food for their animals or hay that they sell for an income			0
" many areas of the state remained under flood warnings monday , with the @entity146 reporting continued record flooding in some locations			1
for instance , @entity149 in @entity150 , @entity1 , went from a depth of less than 4 feet sunday morning to more than 17 feet at 1:45 a.m. monday -- nearly 4 feet higher than the record set in 1938 , according to the @entity146			1
while it was falling monday morning , it was still 8 feet above flood stage			2
@entity11 said additional flooding problems were likely as water poured out of smaller streams into larger rivers			2
@entity2 ireporter @entity160 had been through a hurricane before , but he said @entity1 's mountainous terrain amplified the effects of @entity26 's rains			1
" because it 's so mountainous here , the water all drains into these little creeks and rivers with a rushing force that 's powerful enough to move buildings that have been standing for 100 years , " he said			1
unlike many states , @entity1 did not order or suggest evacuations			1
many of the state 's towns are in lowlands and there are few large areas of dry land , so large - scale evacuations are impractical , @entity11 said			1
some towns did partially evacuate overnight , including the state capital of @entity185 , but the situation in the town of 8,000 located 50 miles from @entity188 was not as bad as feared , officials said			2
floodwaters appeared to peak on the @entity190 early monday			0
" there does not appear to be much additional flooding from what has been previously reported , " said city manager @entity191			0
" overall we do not expect conditions to get worse			0
" in @entity0 , a city of 12,000 people on the @entity201 border , @entity197 flowed out of its banks and undermined a three - story building , threatening to bring it down			0
" we 've seen nothing like this , " said @entity205 , town manager for @entity0			0
lifelong resident @entity208 watched the @entity111 rip away at the footings of the historic @entity210 covered bridge as it washed through the heart of the town			0
" it is just about impossible to imagine this bridge being taken out , " @entity208 said in an @entity214			0
" it 's usually ( far ) above the water level			0
" @entity2 's @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			0
