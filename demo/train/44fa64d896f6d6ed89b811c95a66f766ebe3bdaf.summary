@entity1 , @entity0 -- a campaigner for a @entity5 grandmother on death row in @entity7 made a unique plea for her life thursday -- from atop a plinth in @entity1 's @entity11			1
@entity12 uses his slot on the plinth in @entity11 to campaign for clemency for @entity15			1
@entity15 , 51 , recorded her message this week from the prison in @entity18 , where she is serving her sentence , as part of an effort to win clemency			1
campaigners say @entity24 's trial was " catastrophically flawed " and that her court - appointed lawyer failed to take steps that could have at least spared her the death penalty			1
an appeal is pending in the 5th @entity30			0
" i 'm sorry if i sound like a desperate woman , " she said on the tape			0
the @entity5 people may be my last hope			0
" a @entity37 man who has taken an interest in @entity24 's case played her seven - minute recording over and over for an hour while standing atop one of @entity11 's large statue bases , or plinths			1
he held up placards with messages from @entity24 and stood in front of a life - size cardboard cutout of her			1
do you think the campaign will have any effect ? send us your comments " please listen and tell everyone you know , " @entity24 said in her message			1
" please do n't let me die here			0
" a contest currently under way in @entity1 allows members of the public to win an hour atop the empty plinth in @entity11			1
winners can do anything during their hour that they like -- perform , demonstrate , speak , or simply be silent			0
@entity12 , 46 , who works for a local government homelessness service in @entity37 , won a slot but could n't think of what he would do during his hour			0
he said he asked @entity70 , a @entity5 charity that he supports , whether he could do anything for them , and they suggested he focus on @entity24 's case			1
" i thought that was the most important thing of all -- to stop someone who is not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt , who i believe is innocent , of being executed , " @entity12 told @entity2			0
it 's " just an unbelievable injustice			0
" he said he hoped his demonstration would lead people to inquire about the case and ask their members of @entity84 to do the same			0
" @entity15 's speech to @entity11 shows that she is a terrified woman , and with good reason , " said @entity85 , director of @entity70			1
" @entity7 plans to kill her by lethal injection , which is a painful and lonely death			1
" he added : " the @entity5 government must do everything in its power to prevent @entity15 's death			1
" the @entity94 has filed two amicus briefs in @entity24 's case complaining that @entity5 was not notified of her original arrest , said a @entity94 spokesman , who declined to be named in line with policy			1
the first was in 2006 with a @entity103 district court in @entity7 and the second was in may of this year with the federal appeals court			1
the @entity94 is also in close touch with @entity24 and her legal representatives , the spokesman said			1

" @entity24 was convicted of taking part in the may 2001 murder of @entity116 , a 25 - year - old @entity7 woman , @entity70 said			1
@entity116 and her 4 - day - old son were abducted by men demanding drugs and cash ; she later suffocated while her son survived			0

@entity24 , who asserts her innocence , was sentenced to death in february 2002			1
@entity70 said @entity24 's court - appointed lawyer was incompetent			1
the lawyer failed to meet @entity24 until immediately before the trial , failed to spot flaws and inconsistencies in the prosecution 's case , failed to interview witnesses and did not look at key mitigating evidence , @entity70 said			1
" my lawyer told me he was too busy to work on my case , " @entity24 said in her recording			2
@entity24 was born on the @entity143 island of @entity144 to @entity146 parents and holds a @entity5 passport , @entity70 said			2
she worked as a primary school teacher in @entity144 , a former @entity5 colony , until she was 23 and later moved to @entity7			2
" after her conviction , investigators from @entity70 visited @entity144 and learned that @entity15 was still remembered as a passionate teacher who frequently held extra classes for children with special needs			2
she also taught at @entity155 , sang in a national youth choir and led a volunteer social - work group , " @entity70 said			0
" this information would have enabled ( her lawyer ) to present her to the jurors as a dedicated teacher and community leader -- factors that might well have induced them to vote to spare her life			0
" @entity24 worked as a confidential informant for the @entity166 during the 1980s , befriending suspected traffickers to get information and sometimes to make test purchases of drugs , @entity70 said			2
@entity24 believes that she was framed because of her work with the agency , @entity70 said			2
lawyers for @entity24 have lodged an appeal with the appeals court court in @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity70 said			2
if the court rejects her appeal , an execution date will be set , the charity said			0
@entity12 said he had a lump in his throat when he arrived at @entity11 for his demonstration			2
" this is about someone 's life and there 's nothing more important than that , " he told @entity2			2
" it is an emotional thing			0
" only three of @entity11 's four plinths have statues on top			1
the fourth plinth never had a statue and has stood empty for years , with specially commissioned artworks occasionally being featured on top			0
this year , sculptor @entity200 came up with the idea to have people stand atop the plinth as a sort of living monument			0
thousands applied for the chance to occupy the plinth			0
the project runs 24 hours a day			0
it began in july and is set to end in october .			0
