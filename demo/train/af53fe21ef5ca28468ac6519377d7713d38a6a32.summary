-- @entity2 ' agent says he may take legal action after the world 's no. 1 golfer was accused of cheating on the course this year			1
@entity7 , who has helped the @entity8 become the planet 's wealthiest athlete , criticized a " shameful , baseless " report on the @entity13 website by tv commentator @entity14			1
@entity14 , a former pro golfer , said in his end - of - season summary that @entity2 had been " cavalier with the rules " -- and he made parallels with one of his own school experiences when he was caught cheating in a math test and marked down from a grade of 100 to an " @entity21 " he said his teacher quoted the 19th - century poem " @entity25 " by @entity26 : " oh , what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive ! " " i never did ask my teacher how she knew i cheated and i certainly did n't protest the grade , " wrote the 51 - year - old , who gave @entity2 an " f " for his season 's achievements , crossing out a " 100 " mark			1
" i knew i had done the wrong thing and my teacher the right , but i never forgot the way i felt when i read that quote			0
" i remember when we only talked about @entity2 's golf			1
he won five times and contended in majors and won the @entity45 and ... how shall we say this ... was a little cavalier with the rules			1
" @entity2 was named the @entity50 's player of the year for the 11th time after a season in which he won five tournaments and had two top - 10 finishes in the four majors			1
however , at @entity56 he was controversially not disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard after taking an improper drop , but was penalized			0
the 37 - year - old was also given two - stroke penalties in @entity61 in january and last month at the @entity62 for rule infringements , while he was suspected by some of taking a favorable drop at may 's @entity66 after hitting a water hazard			1
" there 's nothing you can call a golfer worse than a cheater			0
this is the most deplorable thing i have seen , " @entity7 said in a statement he later verified to @entity0			1
" i 'm not one for hyperbole , but this is absolutely disgusting			1
calling him a cheater ? i 'll be shocked , stunned if something is not done about this			0
something has to be done			0
there are certainly things that just do n't go without response			0
i 'm not sure if there is n't legal action to be taken			1
i have to give some thought to legal action			1
" this is , ' hey , look at me , ' in its lowest form			0
@entity14 's comments are shameful , baseless and completely out of line			1
in his rulings , @entity2 voiced his position , accepted his penalty and moved on			2
there was no intention to deceive anyone			0
" @entity14 's uninformed and malicious opinions , passed on as facts , and his desperate attempt to garner attention is deplorable			1
@entity14 has a right to form his opinion			2
if he wants to give him an ' f ' for his year ? it 's silly			2
but this goes so far above that and is out of bounds			0
" @entity14 debated the issue on his @entity115 account , where he denied calling @entity2 a cheat			1
" to be accurate , i said he was cavalier with the rules			2
how is it anyone would argue to the contrary , " he wrote			0
@entity123 golf journalist @entity122 responded : " the fact you wrote that and gave him an ' f ' meant you called him a cheat			2
" meanwhile , @entity130 -- whose season has gone from bad to worse since missing the cut with @entity2 in @entity61 when they were no. 1 and 2 in the rankings -- dropped out of contention at the @entity136 saturday			2
the @entity137 , now sixth in the world , blamed a " weird " day after his third - round 75 left him 10 shots behind leader @entity141 - tae of @entity142 , who was four clear			0
i actually started the round really well , " said the 24 - year - old , who has begun legal proceedings against his management company and reportedly also split from tennis star girlfriend @entity148			2
" i just think the story of the day is that i missed a lot of putts , missed a lot of chances for birdies at the start of the round and then mixed a few short ones for pars in the middle and end of the round			0
that 's really what it was			0
" so yeah , a frustrating day because i was in contention after two days and if you shoot a solid score today you 're right in there tomorrow			0
