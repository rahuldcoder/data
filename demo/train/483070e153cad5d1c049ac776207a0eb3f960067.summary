@entity0 , @entity1 -- anti-gadhafi forces have come across a military site in southern @entity1 that contains what appears to be radioactive material			1
the site , not far from @entity8 in the @entity10 desert , has two warehouses containing thousands of blue barrels marked with tape saying " radioactive , " and plastic bags of yellow powder sealed with the same type tape			1
the fact that @entity1 might have radioactive material is not a surprise : in 2004 , the the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) confirmed that the @entity1 government had yellowcake stored in @entity8			1
afterward , @entity24 's government vowed its intent to dismantle its nuclear program , and there has been no indication it was ever developed enough that it might appear in weapons			2
still , the fact that it was lying seemingly unguarded -- such that it could end up in the hands of terrorists or nations intent on illicitly turning radioactive material into weapons -- is a definite cause for concern , said @entity38 , a former weapons inspector and now president of the @entity41			1
" during wars , nuclear material is not protected very well , " @entity42 said , noting that @entity20 crews in the past have entered war - zones such as in the former @entity46 and @entity47			1
" the @entity20 needs to get there as soon as possible , to determine if anything is missing			2
" yellowcake is processed uranium ore that can be used to produce enriched uranium for nuclear purposes , with @entity42 noting that it -- if it is what outside experts believe -- is not highly radioactive , in itself			2
even so , @entity60 seconded the sentiment that the discovery was cause for alarm			0
" these pictures are amazing and sobering			0
remember we had been assured by the @entity67 just weeks ago in august that significant mustard gas , manpads and nuclear materials were all secured			0
this discovery appears to show that in fact we ca n't count on anything being secured in @entity1 now , " @entity60 said			2
the yellowcake is not in itself a real danger , but having it next to high explosives is a potential environmental disaster if they were to explode , said @entity60 , who 's president of the @entity80 , a global security foundation			0
fighters entered @entity8 , long regarded as a @entity84 stronghold , on wednesday afternoon and initially met no resistance , officials said			0
about a dozen lightly armed revolutionary fighters are now guarding the military site outside the city			1
electric power in @entity8 , which had been off for two weeks , was restored thursday evening			0
in addition , @entity90 , one of the nation 's mobile phone networks , began working in the city after being down for more than a month			0
elsewhere , revolutionaries have taken control of the southwestern town of @entity100 , chasing @entity24 loyalists from the area as @entity1 's new leaders continued to gain momentum , @entity96 field commander @entity95 said thursday			1
the announcement comes days after the @entity96 received the significant milestone of being recognized by @entity107 , @entity47 and the @entity108 as @entity1 's legitimate rulers			1
" due to the role and obligations that the @entity96 has fulfilled and due to the @entity108 position , @entity47 - @entity96 ( diplomatic ) relations will move from semi-official to official , " said @entity47 foreign minister @entity110 , according to state - run @entity111			1
@entity47 had been among @entity24 's biggest allies in the region , and is where his wife and three of his children fled to in august			1
troops loyal to @entity1 's new leaders have been putting pressure on several regime holdout cities in recent days			1
along with thursday 's military action in @entity100 , fighters have also clashed with @entity24 loyalists in the northern town of @entity131 and in @entity132			2
despite not yet having complete control over the entire country , the @entity96 says it is planning on how to set up a new government			0
@entity136 , a senior member of the @entity96 , told @entity2 wednesday that the formation of a @entity1 government will not be announced until @entity140 forces control the borders of the country and liberate the three cities of @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity8			1
that effort could take up to one month , he said			0
after liberation , the @entity96 will create an interim government by appointing a prime minister who will be responsible for forming the government			0
the prime minister will decide how many ministers will be in that interim government , but he must return to the @entity96 for approval of that government			0
that government will create a new constitution that will be put before the @entity1 people for approval in a referendum			2
@entity2 's @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 contributed to this report			0
