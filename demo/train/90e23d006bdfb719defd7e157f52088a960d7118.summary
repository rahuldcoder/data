-- big cities are rarely home to thriving farmlands , but a group of @entity6 architects hope to change that with the " @entity8 " -- an urban farming project that will attempt to grow and sell all the food of a modern supermarket in one place			1
the firm behind the proposal , @entity14 - based @entity13 , intends to produce everything from risotto rice , to kiwis to @entity21 fish all on one 4,000 - acre plot of disused land in @entity24 , @entity25 's largest metropolitan area			1
in defiance of the country 's moderate climate , the architects say they have devised a system to control the park 's outdoor environment , using old and new farming technologies to simulate @entity34 and tropical climates in an ecologically sustainable way			1
the land , which had been earmarked for a large block of business developments before the global recession , cuts across the city fringes of @entity14 and @entity40 , serving a potential customer - base of over one million people , according to @entity13			1
" the cities surrounding the proposed site are home to 170 different eating cultures -- from @entity52 to @entity53 , from @entity54 to @entity55 -- and we 're aiming to grow food to satisfy all their tastes , " said @entity43 , an award - winning architect and one of the brains behind the " @entity8 " -- which has been shortlisted for the upcoming @entity47 in november			1
" the plan is to divide the park into three climate zones -- moderate , @entity34 and tropical			0
because this will also be a recreational space , our goal is to make it as open as possible , without using greenhouses , " he said			0
but how exactly do you create a warm outdoor microclimate on the urban fringes of a north @entity70 city ? according to @entity43 , it 's not as far - fetched or futuristic as it sounds			1
" the main differences between a @entity34 and moderate climate are longer periods of light and warmth in the evening , " he explained			0
" to make up this difference we 'll use a combination of traditional and modern farming methods that all work by trapping and storing heat and releasing it when temperatures drop , " so , in an effort to grow typically @entity34 foods like olives and peppers , for instance , van @entity43 says he 'll need little more than rows of " snake walls " and " climate pylons			2
" according to @entity43 , " snake walls " , made from clay , curve over crops helping to shield them from cold winds , while simultaneously emitting heat absorbed during the day			0
" they used this method in the 18th century gardens of eastern @entity106 's @entity105 , so the king could grow grapes to make wine that tasted as good as the @entity111 stuff , " he said			0
" climate pylons " are a more modern method of trapping heat			2
@entity115 says they simply rain down a fine mist of water from high up , creating clouds that act like vapor roofs , stopping warm air from disappearing into the sky			2
however , for tropical foods like mangoes and basmati rice , van @entity43 says the park will need another layer of warmth			0
" in this case , we 'll pump geothermal energy -- heat stored deep in the lower soils -- up to the top using underground pipes filled with water , " he explained			0
" this technology is used in football stadiums to stop the pitches freezing over and more recently it 's being used to heat homes			0
" @entity115 concedes that the pumps and electric - powered lights that artificially extend daylight hours will require an additional input of energy , but claims that it will all be met by local renewable sources			0
read related : ' @entity150 ' buildings could inhale city carbon emissions the @entity8 was commissioned by planning officials from the @entity153 , and plans are afoot for a small test site to be up and running by the end of this year			2
if successful , the firm believes this type of system could form part of a new approach to sustainable farming , making use of urban greenbelts while helping to reduce the carbon footprint associated with food production -- which accounts for up to 30 % of total emissions worldwide , according to a 2008 @entity169 report			1
" the dominant food - production system is based on fossil fuel at every level , " said dr @entity170 , professor of food and health policy at @entity174 's @entity173			1
" it needs oil to make the fertilizer , oil for the farm , oil for the food processing , oil for the packaging and oil to transport it to the shops , " he added			2
@entity115 says the park will reduce carbon emissions by cutting down on food processing and transport costs , while stimulating local industry and social bonds			1
" because all the food in our supermarket will be grown on site we wo n't need a big processing factory to make packaging and we wo n't have to burn lots of fossil fuel to transport it across the globe , " he said			1
however , the @entity8 concept does not appeal to everyone			0
" anything that reduces food miles and other carbon emissions linked to food production is normally a positive thing , " said dr @entity207 , lecturer in crop sciences at the @entity210 's @entity209			1
" however , i have reservations about any system that creates open artificial climates			1
" we know that we are suffering from climate change , with one area enduring long wet spells while another goes through a prolonged drought			0
i wonder if we really ought to be exploring technologies that seek to control our already unpredictable weather cycles			2
" @entity226 is also concerned that the introduction of alien climates may also precipitate the introduction of alien pests			2
" every time you raise humidity , you raise disease affectability -- because where you have good conditions for growth you also have good conditions for disease to grow			0
i think creating tropical climates next to moderate ones could introduce a host of new diseases and pests to the region in quite an unpredictable way , " she warned			1
finally , while @entity226 says she appreciates what @entity43 and his team are trying to do , she doubts that the system could be replicated on a wider scale			2
" in my experience , it takes a lot of resources to create a relatively small microclimate			0
this means land that could otherwise be used for growing native crops is taken up with technology -- whether it be rows and rows of snake walls or climate pylons or whatever , " she said			1
for @entity43 , this type of criticism misses the point , because he sees the @entity8 as just one of many possible alternatives to the existing system of food production			1
" i 'm not a preacher of any one form of agriculture , " he said			0
" just like our energy , i think our future food supplies will have to come from a variety of sources , using a variety of methods -- of which we are sure this will be one			0
" but this is about more than sustainable , non-intensive farming , it 's about cultivating community ties and giving new meaning to a space on the edge of the city that is currently being used for very little else			0
