@entity0 -- president @entity2 on wednesday proposed background checks on all gun sales and bans on military style assault weapons and high - capacity magazines as part of a package of steps to reduce gun violence in the wake of the @entity14 school massacre last month			1
with relatives of some of the 20 children killed in the @entity19 rampage looking on , @entity2 signed 23 executive actions -- which do n't require congressional approval -- to strengthen existing gun laws and take related steps on mental health and school safety			1
he also called on @entity26 to reinstate an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 , to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds , and to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun , whether at a store or in a private sale at an auction or convention			1
@entity37 hold key to passage of gun legislation referring to the young students killed in the @entity14 shootings on december 14 and other victims of gun violence , @entity2 said the nation must do a better job of protecting its children , especially when they are in schools , shopping malls , movie theaters and other public places			1
while some of the steps he proposed are given little chance of winning congressional approval in the face of the nation 's powerful gun lobby , @entity2 said all efforts must be made to reduce chronic gun violence in the country			1
" this is our first task as a society -- keeping our children safe , " the president said , adding that saving even one life would make the changes he seeks worth the effort			0
read @entity2 's proposals republicans immediately rejected the @entity2 proposals as an attack on the constitutional right to bear arms			2
" nothing the president is proposing would have stopped the massacre at @entity14 , " said a statement by sen. @entity77 , @entity78 , considered an up - and - coming @entity83 leader			0
" president @entity2 is targeting the @entity86 rights of law - abiding citizens instead of seriously addressing the real underlying causes of such violence			1
" the powerful @entity91 said it would work with @entity26 to find what it called " real solutions to protecting @entity95 's most valuable asset -- our children			2
" " attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation , " the @entity91 said in a statement			2
" only honest , law - abiding gun owners will be affected and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy			0
" @entity2 - backed gun bills considered a long shot in @entity26 gun rights at center of debate @entity91 president @entity113 said the " second amendment is going to survive " @entity2 's efforts on gun control			1
" what we want to see is what they really have in mind			0
they 've got bullet points			0
there 's going to be a lot more to it than that , " @entity113 said on @entity1 's " @entity124 with @entity125			2
" @entity2 called accusations that he seeks to violate gun rights untrue , saying opponents want to wage a campaign of intimidation and fear instead of working with him for needed changes			1
" we can respect the @entity86 while keeping an irresponsible law - breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale , " he said			2
gun control support rises but divide remains over what to do gun control supporters , including relatives of shooting victims , lauded @entity2 's proposals as a good first step to reduce gun violence and urged legislators to take on the difficult issue instead of reverting to partisan postures			1
" when you are disheartened by the number of steps that have to be taken , by the fears of gun advocates , by the politics , please dig deep and find new heart , " urged @entity153 , the mother of @entity154 , the legislative staffer killed in the 2010 @entity156 shooting that disabled @entity165 rep. @entity164 of @entity166			0
" think for a moment about your young staffers , your children or grandchildren , " @entity153 continued			0
" now imagine that that cell phone in your pocket is vibrating and the message says they have been murdered by a stranger with an assault weapon			0
imagine that , then shore up your resolve and keep working to protect your staffers , our children , our nation			0
we need you to not give up			0
" however , @entity183 of the @entity185 website , which opposes tighter gun controls , told @entity1 that the @entity2 proposals were misdirected			1
" he did absolutely nothing to address the criminal element , " said @entity183 , who argued that studies show criminals get guns on the street instead of buying them from licensed gun shops that conduct background checks			1
fully enforcing existing gun laws and making criminals serve their full prison terms would do more to halt gun violence , according to @entity183 , who added that government " can not legislate evil out of the minds of men			0
" polls capture public sentiment vice president @entity207 led a panel assembled by @entity2 to examine gun control steps after the @entity14 shootings , which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings			1
@entity207 's recommendations formed the basis of the package of proposals @entity2 announced wednesday			2
" the world has changed , and it 's demanding action , " @entity207 said at the @entity218 event			0
opponents promise a political fight , with an @entity91 spokesman saying tuesday that the group has experienced what he called an " unprecedented " spike in membership numbers since new calls for gun control began in the past month			1
approximately 250,000 people have joined the organization 's existing 4.25 million members , according to @entity91 spokesman @entity233			2
in addition , the @entity91 is receiving an influx of financial contributions , he said , adding : " this is going to be a very expensive and hard - fought fight			2
" a @entity1 / @entity241 / @entity240 poll wednesday indicated that @entity95 generally favor stricter gun control , but they do n't believe that stricter gun laws alone would reduce gun violence			1
according to the survey , 55 % of @entity95 generally favor stricter gun control laws , with 56 % saying that it 's currently too easy to buy guns in this country			1
however , only 39 % say that stricter gun controls would reduce gun violence all by themselves			1
@entity2 called for citizens to let their elected representatives know what they think , saying : " the only way we can change is if the @entity95 people demand it			2
" @entity91 draws heat over its new shooting game he proposed legislative steps he previously has backed , such as reinstating the @entity262 - era ban on assault weapons , and also requested that funds be made available to help treat mental illness and provide schools with support to enhance their safety			1
his executive actions signed wednesday called for tougher enforcement of existing laws and required federal agencies to provide data for background checks			1
a senior administration official told reporters the price tag for the entire package was $ 500 million			0
@entity2 also said he would nominate @entity280 , the acting director of the @entity281 , to become its permanent chief			2
the agency has been without a full - time director for six years			0
a main focus of @entity2 's steps was closing loopholes in background checks			1
while requiring universal background checks would require congressional approval , some of the executive actions signed by @entity2 were intended to bolster the existing system			1
across the country , more than a million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records , drug use or mental health issues , according to @entity296 figures			1
that figure , however , is a small fraction of overall gun sales			1
opinion : @entity95 's gun problem is not a race problem " if you look at the combination of likelihood of passage and effectiveness of curbing gun crime , universal background checks is at the sweet spot , " said sen. @entity310 , @entity312 - @entity311 , a leading backer of such screening			1
@entity2 also called for more money to strengthen gun safety at schools , including hiring more counselors such as retired law enforcement officers to help educate students on gun issues			2
he also called for more funding for communities to hire more police officers , but stopped short of seeking the @entity91 's proposal for armed guards at every school			0
the @entity1 / @entity241 / @entity240 poll wednesday showed that respondents favored armed guards in schools by 54 % -45 %			1
congressional hearings planned legislators said working with @entity26 will be paramount in curbing gun violence			0
@entity341 rep. @entity340 told @entity1 on tuesday that a ban on high - capacity magazines could garner @entity83 support , but a full - scale assault weapon ban would be hard to get passed in the @entity83 - controlled @entity218			2
@entity218 and @entity37 committees said they would start holding hearings on gun control measures in coming weeks			1
@entity350 sheriff : ' unconstitutional ' gun control laws wo n't be enforced in @entity311 , @entity165 gov. @entity352 on tuesday signed into law a series of new gun regulations -- the nation 's first since the @entity14 shootings			1
both @entity311 's @entity83 - controlled @entity37 and @entity359 - controlled @entity358 approved the measure by overwhelming margins			0
it includes a statewide gun registry and adds a uniform licensing standard across the state , altering the current system , in which each county or municipality sets a standard			0
residents are also restricted to purchasing ammunition magazines that carry seven bullets , rather than 10			0
@entity113 derided outlawing high - capacity magazines as " a bidding match " that focuses on the wrong issue			0
" so the president says you do n't need 30 - round magazines			0
how about a 10 - round magazine ? @entity352 says , ' well , i can do better than that			0
i 'll make it a seven - round magazine , ' " @entity113 said			0
" the fact of the matter is the kinds of people who do this , particularly the mentally unbalanced -- who are the most likely people to do it -- should n't have any magazines , " he said			0
" the changes in @entity311 are largely cosmetic , " said @entity1 legal analyst @entity392 , who described state 's existing regulations as " the toughest gun laws in the @entity95			2
" lawmakers in at least 10 other states are reviewing some form of new gun regulations in the new year			0
@entity401 watching with interest @entity1 's @entity403 , @entity404 , @entity405 , @entity406 and @entity407 contributed to this report , and @entity409 updated from @entity410 .			0
