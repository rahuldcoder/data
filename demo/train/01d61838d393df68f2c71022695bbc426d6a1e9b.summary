it 's a bit of a joke around my office that i 'm a professional bridesmaid and wedding attender , sacrificing vacation and a lot of money to celebrate the nuptials of my friends			1
total bridesmaid appearances : 12 total weddings attended : i stopped counting at 74 total amount spent : i 'm scared to find out , but according to @entity13 , the average amount spent attending a wedding is $ 539 , so you do the math. let 's just say my credit card company loves me			1
luckily , i happen to love weddings			1
but after doing things the wrong way the entirety of my bridesmaid career , i now consider myself an expert on how not to go broke or resent your friends getting married			1
consider these my gift to you			1
take a deep breath and smile if the thought of attending yet another wedding does n't fill your heart with happiness like it does mine , try to remember : this is your friend			2
and he or she has asked you to participate in one of the biggest days of his or her life			2
this is a good thing			2
weddings are not an exercise established to stress you out or bring you down , and if you 've been lucky to have been included in any part of the day , well , then , smile , because that means you 're someone 's friend ! smiles and deep breaths also help when it 's time to fork over your cash and kiss your precious vacation days goodbye			1
be realistic and honest after the squeals and hugs and " i 'd be honoreds " are over , the sometimes - uncomfortable conversations about what 's expected of you as a member of the wedding party will inevitably follow			2
@entity64 is the site director for the popular wedding website @entity66			2
she advises wedding guests -- that 's right , guests -- to " get organized " when it comes to attending a wedding			2
" if you know you have a wedding coming up in august and you know there will be expenses coming up , you may have to cut back in other areas , " @entity64 said			2
" @entity78 out your calendar and set a budget			2
" once you know what 's expected of you as a guest or attendant and you 've taken inventory of your budget , communicate any worries you might have to the bride or groom			0
let them know what you can do and , more important , what you ca n't			0
if you 're having trouble making rent , for example , an extravagant bachelorette party in the @entity94 is probably not feasible			0
ask the dress shop whether you can set up a payment plan to make monthly contributions toward your wedding wardrobe			0
once the date is set , book your flight and hotel rooms early to avoid high fares			0
whatever you do , let the bride and groom know where you stand			0
flaking at the last minute because you ca n't afford it is a guaranteed way to put a friendship in turmoil			0
get choosy i 'm not one for putting a hierarchy on friendships , but when it comes to minding your finances and attending weddings , you ca n't do it all			1
so it 's ok to be selective when it comes to whose wedding invitation you accept and whose you decline			0
we all know about the " courtesy invite			0
" your childhood neighbor you have n't seen in 15 years would love to have you there , but sometimes you have to say no. be polite and send a thoughtful gift , but do n't waste your frequent flier miles on a wedding for someone whose middle name you do n't know			1
shack up and double up part of the fun of traveling to weddings is that they 're usually a reunion with old friends -- and therefore present excellent opportunities to cut costs			1
" going in with your friends for a group gift is a great way to buy something more substantial for the couple , " @entity64 suggests			1
@entity64 advises finding out ahead of time who is going to the wedding so you can make plans to share a hotel room or at least share transportation costs from the airport			0
parading down the aisle dressed is n't exactly the same as strolling down a white , sandy beach , but if weddings are eating up your money and your vacation time at work , turn it into a vacation by tacking a couple of days on to the beginning or end of the trip			1
last summer , when my friend @entity169 got married in @entity170 , i scheduled a visit with another friend in @entity173 and then drove up the @entity174			0
think outside the gift box one of the best things about getting married is the loot you receive			1
but when it comes to presents , most of the brides i talked to said they 'd prefer their loved ones ' presence at their nuptials to a fancy gift			1
thanks to @entity189 and @entity190 blogs , homemade gift ideas are easy to find and replicate			1
some of my favorites include homemade soaps , a scrapbook of unprofessional pictures from the wedding and collections of recipes from friends and family			0
if @entity189 makes you feel as inadequate as i do , offer to house - sit or dog - sit while the couple is on their honeymoon or stock their fridge with a homemade dinner for when they return			0
just because it 's not on their registry does n't mean it wo n't be appreciated			0
recycle that dress you were waiting for this one , were n't you ? it 's a myth , ladies			0
despite many a bride promising her maids " you can wear it again , " i 've actually never been able to pull this off			0
count the dress as a loss , a memory of a good time and the start to your very own " @entity228 " collection			0
though i 've never regretted any of the money i spent helping get my friends down the aisle to say " i do , " with a little more forethought , planning and creativity , i could have chicken danced a lot easier without cracking open my nest egg			1
follow @entity238 on @entity239 and keep up with @entity240 on @entity241 .			1

@entity238 has been a bridesmaid 12 times
she loves weddings but hates how hard they hit her *wallet*
planning can save you a lot of cash
save on the gift by getting creative
