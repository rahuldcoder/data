@entity0 , @entity1 -- last week , the @entity4 administration announced that the deep waters of the @entity6 are again open for drilling			1
that the @entity9 oil disaster is continuing and will have lasting effects is unacknowledged			2
the @entity9 disaster was the largest oil catastrophe the country has ever seen , and the @entity6 and our communities have a long road to recovery			1
our friends in the fishing industry are still out of work , the effects of the spill on wildlife have not been fully assessed , the safety of our seafood is still in question and entire cultures are barely hanging on			1
the administration says new rules and regulations will make deepwater oil drilling safer			2
although we welcome the new rules , we believe that they do not go far enough			0
there is little assurance that the @entity36 , charged with enforcement , has the resources to hold the industry accountable			0
@entity40 believes further steps must be taken immediately to ensure the safety of oil drilling in deep off - shore waters			1
the government and the public need to stay focused on the disaster and environmental impacts that are just beginning to play out , continue to hold @entity9 accountable and act to make sure this never happens again			0
we hope the @entity4 administration approaches continued cleanup , regulatory reform and damage mitigation , none of which is even close to being accomplished , with the same urgency it has shown in efforts to reopen the @entity6 to deepwater drilling			2
@entity9 's spill is only the latest and most visible evidence of the oil and gas industry 's ongoing environmental destruction in the @entity6			1
@entity1 loses the equivalent of a football field worth of wetlands every hour , and 40 to 60 percent of that loss is attributed to oil and gas activity , including exploration and dredging of pipeline canals			0
the oil and gas industry must pay its fair share for coastal restoration , and a large portion of the fines levied against @entity9 should be dedicated to ongoing restoration efforts			1
despite what the rest of the oil industry claims , @entity9 is not a rogue player when it comes to taking big risks at the expense of the @entity6			1
other oil and gas companies have violated safety and environmental regulations			2
regulatory reforms and policy changes are urgently needed to prevent drilling disasters , ensure oil - rig safety in the @entity6 and elsewhere and guarantee rapid response and cleanup when accidents happen			1
industry in the @entity6 still lacks the necessary assets to effectively respond to a catastrophic blowout			1
in light of the abysmal response , containment and cleanup we have observed and continue to observe in the aftermath of the @entity9 disaster , it 's clear that we need new rules that require real , credible blowout response plans before any new deepwater drilling is permitted			1
there is only one way to make sure the federal agencies and the oil and gas industry remain vigilant and operate as safely as possible -- local communities must have a voice in decisions regarding oil and gas development			1
because we are the ones who pay the price for the industry 's bad decisions , we deserve a seat at the table			0
an opposing view on reopening the @entity6 to deepwater drilling a @entity125 is essential to formalizing the public 's role in overseeing what the industry does in our @entity6			2
it worked in @entity132 after the @entity134 spill , and it will work in the @entity6			0
@entity135 should pass legislation to create and require the oil industry to fund a @entity125			0
@entity135 must also do its part to aid restoration of the @entity6			0
the @entity142 's " @entity141 's @entity140 : a plan for @entity149 in the @entity150 of the @entity151 , " assembled by secretary of the navy @entity152 , lays out a vision for community recovery , improving public health , coastal restoration and marine resiliency that can begin to restore the @entity6			0
we strongly urge @entity135 to support the plan and ensure @entity9 fines go toward restoring the @entity6			2
early this month , 46 community , local , regional , national and international environmental , social justice and fishermen 's groups met in @entity162 , @entity163			0
we drafted a set of goals and principles that we believe must guide the recovery and restoration of the @entity6 , our coast and our communities in the wake of the @entity9 drilling disaster			1
together , we want the nation to know that the oil is still here , and so are we			0
the @entity6 's people and places need lasting and continued support to get back on their feet			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			0

@entity184 : @entity6 waters open for drilling before @entity9 spill even assessed or cleaned
new rules do *n't* go far enough , she says ; federal agency lacks resources to enforce
@entity195 : @entity6 fishing industry and people just hanging on ; seafood safety in question
local communities must have voice in oil , gas development decisions , @entity184 writes
