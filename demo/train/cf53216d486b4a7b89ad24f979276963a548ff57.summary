@entity0 -- a decree from the early 1990s , reimplemented by @entity4 regulators , is putting an end to @entity4 television and radio announcers naming social networking sites on air except for news purposes			1
the decree banned " clandestine advertising " : the promotion of a brand outside the boundaries of recognized publicity avenues			1
the reimplementation of the ruling by @entity4 's @entity18 means that @entity4 programs will no longer be able to urge their viewers or listeners to follow them on specific sites , such as @entity23 , as has become the norm in worldwide broadcasting			1
the controversy began when an unnamed @entity4 tv channel approached the council to ask whether , under this decree , they had the right to direct viewers to social sites			1
@entity32 , spokeswoman for the council explained : " @entity34 and @entity23 are commercial brands like @entity36 or @entity37 or any other			1
there are many social networking sites on many topics -- cooking , animals -- why should we mention one and not others ? " from now on news anchors will be able to give only vague instructions as to where to find information online , such as " follow us on social networking sites			1
" @entity4 bloggers have been up in arms on @entity23 and some have even composed tongue - in - cheek ways to get round the ban			1
one suggested : " find live coverage of the trial on our thread on the platform which spreads messages of 140 characters " @entity4 commentators have been speculating on the real roots of this regulation			2
@entity66 , a social networking expert and author of " @entity69 in the @entity70 , " a book looking at the online social media revolution , believes the ban could be a sign of defiance against @entity77 cultural domination			1
" in my mind , " he said , " if it had been a @entity4 social networking site then nobody would have wanted it to be regulated , but because these sites symbolize the @entity83 , regulation is there			1
" this is not the first time anglicized , @entity87 - related vocabulary has been banned in @entity4			2
in 2003 the use of the word " e-mail " was forbidden in all government literature			2
this was due to the @entity96 law , which tries to protect the purity of the @entity4 language from anglicized words and phrases			2
this time , however , the @entity18 insists that the ban is in no way linked to language purity			0
" it 's not at all related			0
it 's true that we are very attached to the @entity4 language and defend it a lot , but ... this is simply about reapplying existing regulations , " @entity32 said			0
the council 's decision did not cause much of a debate in the @entity4 media			0
@entity66 believes that unlike cheese or wine there were no @entity4 interests involved and the @entity4 are simply used to regulation			0
" it does n't faze them because it 's part of their culture , " he said			0
@entity32 emphasized the cultural differences that need to be taken in to account : " we have many , many rules which do not exist elsewhere			0
there is a very different context for this from one country to another			0
in the @entity83 , for example there are advertisements on tv every five minutes , whereas in @entity4 its more like every 20 minutes			0
" she added that , similarly , in the @entity83 product placement is commonplace , but it is forbidden in @entity4			0
many are struck by the bizarre timing of the ban as it comes on the heels of the @entity145 , an internet summit in @entity0 at which president @entity147 met with @entity34 founder @entity148 .			2
