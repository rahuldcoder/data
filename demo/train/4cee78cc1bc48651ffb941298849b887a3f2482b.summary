i first saw the @entity2 glinting in the winter sun from 20,000 feet as my flight from @entity5 made a slow descent on its way to @entity9 's @entity8			1
it seemed a distant blade of light lying next to a speck of an island			2
a surge of gasps and chatter reverberated around the cabin as @entity20 passengers craned their necks to see it			0
as i later approached the island on a ferry , the ship again came into view almost as soon as the ferry left the mainland			2
as we closed in , the vast scale of the cruise ship became clear			1
it was like looking at an apartment block lying in the sea : a ship , yes , but everything about its orientation was wrong			1
she lay on her side , the hull obscenely exposed to our widening eyes			0
the ferry passed within a couple hundred feet as we entered the main port of @entity46 and the huge chunk of rock , the size of a car , could clearly be seen embedded in her hull			0
over the next two weeks , i spent a large part of every day staring at the wreck -- and yet still it surprised me			0
each morning my crew and i would descend the vertiginous road from our hotel , round a sharp bend and there was this colossal ship on her side			2
from the top of the island , the @entity2 looked exactly like a bath - time toy , carelessly capsized by a child 's hand			1
but this surreal tableau was etched in epic proportions			0
now that the frantic first reports of what happened are behind us , @entity65 has built up a much more comprehensive view of what went wrong , thanks to documents , congressional testimony and interviews with dozens of experts , crew members , witnesses and passengers			1
@entity2 disaster focuses attention on how cruise industry operates since the night the @entity2 capsized january 13 , @entity65 has continued to dig to figure out what happened aboard the ship and why			1
we spoke to officials with @entity85 as well as @entity20 investigators examining the incident			0
we 've also spoken with officials with the @entity89 , the body that oversees cruise safety			2
from a broad perspective , @entity65 examined the cruise industry as a whole			1
what we found will be unsettling for anyone who has taken or is thinking of taking a cruise : allegations of inadequate safety briefings and chaos in the minutes after the collision ; a captain who failed to sound a general alarm for almost an hour , meaning vital , lifesaving assemblies at lifeboat stations did not take place ; and a crew that felt unable to act without clear orders from their captain			1
in some cases , lifeboats were not able to be launched because by the time the general alarm finally sounded at 10:48 p.m. , the ship was leaning over too far to allow the lifeboats to launch			2
thirty - two people died in the @entity2 disaster			1
we learned that 6,000 tons of water entered the @entity2 in just 20 minutes			1
for a ship three times the weight of the @entity122 , it was fatal			2
almost immediately , key equipment in the engine room was knocked out			0
the ship 's backup generators were flooded			0
computers that monitor the ship 's stability were also compromised			0
@entity65 's documentary team obtained remarkable footage from the ship 's bridge that revealed captain @entity134 grappling with a situation that was already out of control			1
his ship had a hole below the waterline the width of a football field			0
we also found compelling evidence that @entity147 's decision to " salute " the island of @entity46 by sailing perilously close caused the accident , but also that this was n't the first time the @entity2 had sailed within a few hundred yards of the rocks			1
@entity147 is still awaiting trial on multiple charges of manslaughter , causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship			0
@entity147 escaped the ship on a lifeboat while the ship was capsizing			0
a transcript of his tense exchange with @entity164 officials can be read here , including their order to him to " get on board , damn it ! " perhaps the most chilling account of the night in @entity65 's documentary comes from a family on board - californians @entity173 and @entity175 and their daughters @entity176 and @entity178			1
their story , together with previously unseen footage of that night , gives a real sense of the terror of those trying to escape			0
the @entity185 were among the last to get off the @entity2 alive			1
they are cruise veterans , having been on more than 60 voyages , but now they say they wo n't step foot on another ship until the industry changes			1
some lessons have already being learned			0
@entity195 is introducing new rules about safety briefings , mandatory additional life jackets and , crucially , new equipment is being introduced to accurately track all of @entity195 's ships and notify headquarters if the captain decides to take a detour			0
i 've never been on a cruise ; i love the sea and i 'm a keen sailor			2
but knowing all the concerns and questions about safety aboard cruise ships , i 'd want answers before i took a cruise			2
i would feel more comfortable when the reforms that the @entity89 are recommending are made mandatory .			0
