-- still reeling from the january earthquake , @entity1 is now in the grip of a deadly cholera outbreak			1
aid organizations , already struggling to provide the most basic necessities , now face the possibility of a catastrophic epidemic			2
with this health crisis unfolding , relief leaders shared with @entity0 their views of where @entity1 stands today , and what the country needs to get through to tomorrow			1
the @entity15 was concerned that a waterborne disease outbreak would occur			2
workers stockpiled rehydration salts , cleared water channels , and dug hundreds of emergency latrines			1
even with planning for the worst , the @entity15 's director of humanitarian affairs , @entity21 , was not surprised when the outbreak was identified as cholera			1
" it is the most feared disease in disaster relief , because it spreads extremely quickly and is lethal			0
people can die in as short as four hours , " he said			0
much of the group 's health staff is returning to @entity1 for this outbreak , and the @entity15 is trying to help stop the spread of the disease by protecting water sources , educating about proper hygiene , and improving disposal of human waste			1
@entity21 's biggest concern is a possible outbreak of cholera in a crowded camp , which he likens to holding a match to a tinderbox			1
thousands of @entity1 have lived in densely populated tent camps since the earthquake destroyed their homes			1
" in addition to preventing the spread of this disease , " @entity21 said , " you have to aggressively treat the people affected , as you only have a few hours before someone can die			2
this challenge will overwhelm the @entity1 health system			1
" for those wishing to help respond to the crisis , @entity21 suggests supporting charity medical organizations working in @entity1			1
the @entity57 is also responding to the outbreak , repositioning its doctors and nurses and setting up mobile clinics to create a perimeter around the contaminated zone			2
the group is calling for more nurses to volunteer and preparing its doctor and nurse networks abroad in case this becomes an epidemic			0
" cholera is not endemic to @entity1			1
it is a new disease and health professionals in @entity1 do not have experience with it , " said @entity72 , director of global communications for @entity57			1
@entity57 's medical teams are teaching @entity1 's health professionals how to identify , treat and prevent the disease , in addition to educating the community about proper hygiene and clean water			1
for @entity21 , the outbreak reflects the level of hygiene in @entity1			1
when he saw the squalid conditions in the camps in april , he realized that , despite the @entity15 's best efforts , the longer people were forced to live in these unhealthy , filthy conditions , the more likely it was that cholera would break out			1
@entity94 also sees the continual displacement of the @entity1 people as a constant concern			1
" water and shelter has been the continuing problem , it is a health issue , " she said			2
the @entity57 medical staff is trying to transition from the acute emergency phase to a transitional phase , with more emphasis on long - term care			2
" there is less wound care and a great need for more mental health care and chronic disease care , " @entity94 said			0
however , @entity57 is still addressing the struggles with nutrition and hygiene that were present immediately after the earthquake			0
@entity118 - do founder @entity117 finds advancing the relief process challenging , especially when the initial needs are still not met			0
" food , water , housing , jobs and medical -- those are still the same five things that they need , " @entity117 said			1
" but now we also have to look to the longer goals , more permanent housing and infrastructure			0
we have to move to another phase , but the first is still not finished , so we have two phases at once now			0
" his @entity118 - do foundation is trying to do both			0
workers are training @entity1 to construct home , school and medical domes			1
" you have so many camps with tents and tarps that have now rotted and are duct - taped together , " @entity117 said			0
" people will take anything			0
they need more tents , they will take them , tarps , anything , but that is like putting a @entity151 on it			0
there needs to be a better solution			0
" while his team tackles housing and the @entity159 , it is still trying to conduct water and food truck drops			2
on delivery runs , @entity117 said he finds areas that have not seen distribution in months			2
charity organizations are in the midst of transitioning their work force to address the desperate need for jobs			0
the @entity57 staff has changed since the earthquake to a more local face			0
@entity118 - do has been training @entity1 for housing construction and plans to help bring a factory to the country			2
" @entity176 is the biggest thing -- every single person you talk to wants to work , they are looking for jobs , " @entity117 said			0
until now , @entity15 was focused on education and training programs , instead of direct aid			0
" creating self - reliance is the goal , " @entity21 said .			0

emergency conditions make containing the cholera outbreak *difficult*
aid groups focus on building houses and finding jobs for @entity1 affected by the quake
aid workers observe that food and water deliveries do *n't* get distributed for months at a time
