editor 's note : @entity3 contributor @entity2 is a bestselling author whose forthcoming book is " @entity5 : a @entity6			1
" police tape surrounds the scene of a shooting in southern @entity10 on wednesday			2
( @entity3 ) -- carnage in @entity16 , carnage in @entity10 , and one of the most saddening aspects of the killings is this : the impulse to ask " why , " while present , seems somehow muted			0
there will be a search for answers -- why did @entity27 , the gunman in the @entity24 , murder 10 people , why did @entity23 , the gunman in the @entity16 south , murder 15 people -- but even when a tentative answer is arrived upon , it almost certainly wo n't mean much			1
because the real answer we 're searching for -- the answer that will stop these bursts of bloodshed -- seems destined to ever elude us			1
there is always an impulse to blame obscene killing sprees on outside stimuli			0
in the years just after @entity40 , comic books were cited as an incitement for young people to harm each other			1
violent television programs were subsequently blamed , as video games sometimes are today			0
the connective theory has long been : if society desensitizes people to violence , if violence becomes a commodity , then it will proliferate			1
if people are passively taught that violence is everywhere , then violence will sprout , if not everywhere , then many wheres			1
but to place the brunt of the blame for this on outside forces is to duck a truth that we are understandably reluctant to face : the impulse to murder without remorse seems to be , in some people , almost like a learned language , deriving from somewhere deep and difficult to find			2
thankfully , it remains relatively rare , although during weeks like this one it is not easy to take much comfort in that			0
yet with each new torrent of killings , with each new demonstration that , to some among us , the idea of spreading heartache and horror is not only acceptable , but attractive ... with each new demonstration of that , we find ourselves once again looking for lessons , in a search that can seem perpetually futile			0
are the gunmen in cases like these out to make a name for themselves ? if so , they are ordained to fail ; there was a time when multiple , random murders were enough to give the perpetrators such notoriety that their names became catchphrases			2
@entity94 , whose name means nothing to most people today , had more than one movie made about him after his killing spree on the @entity100 in the 1950s			2
there was a time when we could ascribe , to people who murdered without mercy , a dark desire for the worst kind of fame			1
those names you read in the second paragraph of this story -- @entity114 , @entity23 -- may be freshly in the news today , but you will have forgotten them in a month or two			0
that 's one more numbing sign of just how ordinary extraordinary violence has become : the names fail to stick			1
how to stop this ? there has long been a debate over whether the death penalty is a deterrent to murder , but this week the murderers themselves are both dead , and almost certainly they considered that probability before they set out to kill			1
the learned language of violence seems to contain a concession , on the part of those who absorb it , that their acts may very well conclude with their own dying -- and that the price , in their minds , is acceptable , even , perhaps , sought			2
which may be the most chilling lesson of all			0
because if even death for those who do it is not enough to stop the profane slaughters around the globe , then our impotence in the face of this feels all the more profound			0
whatever our need may be to grasp for answers , the killers , by dying on the day they kill , deny us the chance for even that scant solace			1
it 's the ultimate taunt ; it is as if they are saying : you want to know why ? you 'll never know			0
which leaves us with only one certainty : before long -- in a matter of days , or weeks , or months -- we 'll be asking these questions again			2
the names will change ; the specks on the map will be different			0
but somewhere , someone who has learned the wordless language of spreading hurt and grief will do this once more , and we will pause anew in our daily lives to wonder what has become of us			0
and feel all the more empty at the silence that greets our question			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : the real reason mass murderers kill people is elusive
he asks whether outside *influences* play a role in inciting violence
@entity2 : these days , killers seeking lasting fame seem destined to fail
he says killers who commit *suicide* *prevent* us from knowing their motives
