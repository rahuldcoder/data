we 're only two days into this government shutdown , but it already seems like we 've been here before			1
and in a way , we have			2
the @entity4 and @entity5 got in each other 's faces over the @entity9 debt ceiling in 2011			2
the @entity10 demanded significant budget cuts before agreeing to give @entity12 more borrowing power			1
that amounted to $ 2 trillion in cuts over 10 years			2
but @entity16 never could agree on where to make the cuts , so they were implemented across - the - board			1
the package averted a shutdown then , but did n't soothe the hard feelings created by the standoff			1
plus , add this to the mix : the tea party ca n't stand @entity26			2
they do n't like it , never will			0
with that history in mind , here 's what we know and what we do n't know about the shutdown			1
1995 and 2013 : three differences between two shutdowns divided congress what we know : democrats and @entity4 are deeply divided and barely on speaking terms these days			1
feelings are hurt and fingers are pointing			0
right now the wounds are too fresh and no one is in the mood to give anyone a break			0
the @entity4 - led @entity49 tried to pass a piecemeal funding plan on tuesday night to pay for the @entity51 , veterans affairs and national parks			1
it failed to win the required two - thirds vote , but has no future in any case			1
the @entity5 - led @entity58 was n't about to agree to it and the @entity49 promised a veto			1
senate majority leader @entity61 called the strategy as " just another wacky idea by tea party @entity4			0
" president @entity64 chimed in tuesday , calling the @entity4 " reckless " and saying they 're holding the nation hostage to defund @entity26			0
republicans in the @entity49 say they 'll try again wednesday			0
@entity64 , meanwhile , canceled a trip to the @entity68 and @entity69			0
secretary of state @entity70 will go in his place			0
shutdown ' extremely damaging ' to @entity9 intelligence operations what we do n't know : who will blink first ? right now , both sides are sporting steely eyed stares			1
the @entity49 appears determined to stand its ground			0
on @entity81 , the @entity49 and @entity58 have both refused to budge from their visions for the budget and , beyond that , health care reform			0
but behind the tough facades , are cracks forming ? a small crack now could bring down a party 's strong stance later			0
sen. @entity91 points out that any attempt to repeal @entity26 will fail because the president will veto it and the @entity10 does n't have the votes to override			1
and rep. @entity96 says tea party conservatives only care about " their own agenda			0
" meet the man behind the government shutdown @entity10 what we know : the @entity10 is almost two parties these days -- call them standard @entity4 and tea party @entity4			1
while not polar opposites , the factions have different approaches to changing government			1
both want to cut federal spending , but for the tea party , defunding the president 's signature health care law and slashing deficit spending are causes worth staking a political career on			0
that 's what their constituents elected them to do , they say			0
@entity4 divisions force delay in @entity122 's debt strategy what we do n't know : how united will @entity4 stay as the government shutdown lingers , as government workers go without paychecks and as the spotlight focuses on a @entity16 that ca n't govern or members that ca n't even agree to talk to one another			1
@entity134 's @entity133 : " @entity61 wants a shutdown because he believes it 's a political victory for the @entity5 " how long ? what we know : the last government shutdown took place almost 18 years ago during the @entity142 administration and lasted 21 days			1
what we do n't know : how the major players on @entity81 will get over the bad feelings to end this latest political stalemate			0
right now things do n't look very promising			0
there 's plenty of sniping to go around			0
in an op - ed published online tuesday in @entity151 , house speaker @entity122 lays the shutdown at the feet of @entity5 , especially president @entity64			1
" @entity64 owns this shutdown now , " screams the headline			2
later , the article accuses the president of a " scorched - @entity160 policy of refusing to negotiate in bipartisan way on his health care law , current government funding , or the debt limit			1
" of course , the feeling is mutual			0
on tuesday , the president said it was " strange that one party would make keeping people uninsured the centerpiece of their agenda			0
" " republicans in the @entity174 refused to fund the government unless we defunded or dismantled the @entity26 , " he said			2
should the rhetoric soften , it could signal the beginning of the end of the shutdown			2
10 ways the shutdown would affect you @entity184 what we know : the president , members of @entity16 , their staffs and the military get paid			1
non-essential government employees do n't			2
what we do n't know : how long government workers will have to wait until they see another paycheck			2
some 800,000 federal workers are being furloughed			0
piecemeal funding for their jobs could eventually be approved			0
the pressure of that many jobs hanging over both parties could become too much to bear			0
the shutdown could cost the still - struggling @entity9 economy about $ 1 billion a week in pay			1
and that 's only the tip of the iceberg , experts say			0
the total economic impact is likely to be at least 10 times greater than the simple calculation of lost wages of federal workers , said @entity213 , economist with @entity214			0
his firm estimates that a three - to four - week shutdown would cost the economy about $ 55 billion			1
@entity218 what we know : the @entity9 public is not amused			2
according to a @entity224 / @entity223 poll , 68 % of @entity9 think shutting down the government for even a few days is a bad idea , while 27 % think it 's a good idea			2
the survey taken before the shutdown said most @entity9 would blame congressional @entity4 : sixty - nine percent said they agreed with the statement that the party 's elected officials were acting like " spoiled children			1
" but @entity5 are n't off the hook			0
fifty - eight percent of respondents said they , too , were acting like spoiled kids			2
another poll showed public support for @entity16 at record low levels -- at 10 %			1
what we do n't know : will this high - stakes game of political chicken hurt the approval ratings of individual members ? you know the old expression : the people hate @entity16 , but love their congressman or woman			1
@entity224 poll : @entity10 would bear the brunt of shutdown blame			1

the government shutdown is in its second day
@entity16 is deeply divided , and the @entity10 is *splintered* as well
public approval of @entity16 is at an all - time low
