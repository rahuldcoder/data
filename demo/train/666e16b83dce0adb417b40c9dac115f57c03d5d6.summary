-- a @entity1 , @entity2 , hospital is investigating how up to 17 babies in a neonatal intensive care unit received overdoses of the blood thinner heparin			1
one of the babies died			0
officials at @entity11 say corrective action was taken after the discovery of the overdoses			0
the infant was one of 17 who may have received a more concentrated form of heparin than was prescribed , @entity15 said in a statement			1
@entity21 is an anticoagulant often used to clean the ivs of patients and prevent blood clots from forming in the lines			0
it came into the public spotlight last year when newborn twins of actor @entity30 nearly died after receiving an overdose at a @entity33 hospital			1
nursing staff at the @entity1 hospital discovered the problem sunday -- two days after the medication is believed to have been first administered , according to @entity38 , president and ceo of @entity40			2
the hospital said it took corrective measures after the discovery			0
a preliminary investigation concluded that " the medication error occurred during the mixing process within the hospital pharmacy , " @entity45 said in a statement			1
the baby who died " was seriously ill , and we do not know at this time what role , if any , the higher than expected concentration of heparin played in this baby 's death , " dr. @entity51 , chief medical officer for the health system , said tuesday			2
" our deepest sympathy goes out to this family , " he said			0
twelve of the 16 other babies remain in stable condition in the neonatal intensive care unit , which cares for ill newborns			1
three have been discharged , and one is critical and unstable as that baby has been since admission to the unit , @entity51 said			0
in november , @entity30 's 12 - day - old twins , @entity73 and @entity74 , were undergoing intravenous antibiotic treatment for a staph infection at @entity77 in @entity33			1
according to standard procedure , nurses were supposed to clean the infants ' iv lines with @entity82 , a drug containing a small dose of heparin , to allow the lines to flow freely			0
however , instead of the 10 units of heparin they were supposed to receive , the twins received 10,000 units -- 1,000 times the prescribed amount			2
the babies survived , apparently with no permanent injury , @entity30 later told members of a @entity93 on government oversight , although there is no way to know whether they will show any long - term effects .			2
