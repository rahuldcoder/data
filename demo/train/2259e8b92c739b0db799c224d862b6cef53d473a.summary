-- " @entity1 is tied forever , almost by an umbilical chord , with @entity3 because they obviously had a famous trilogy of fights , of which the first and the last were epic fights			1
" the words of respected boxing journalist @entity10			1
@entity10 , a columnist for @entity12 newspaper @entity11 has covered boxing all over the world and knew ' @entity1 ' -- who died on monday aged 67 after a short battle with liver cancer -- both inside and outside the ring , having reported on his fights during the halcyon period of heavyweight boxing in the early 1970s			1
speaking to @entity21 following the announcement of @entity1 's death , @entity10 said : " in the @entity25 consciousness @entity1 is seen as the man who defined @entity3 in many ways			1
" the first fight was called ' @entity29 ' and took place in @entity31 in 1971			0
@entity3 had called @entity1 an ' @entity32 ' before the fight and it bought a racial dimension to it			1
" when @entity1 tore up the script and knocked down @entity3 , inflicting his first defeat , there were riots all over the country			1
" @entity10 added : " @entity1 was very much part of @entity25 folklore and respected around the world			1
he begrudged for many years the things @entity3 said about him , not only the ' @entity32 ' insult , but also calling him a ' gorilla ' before their epic ' thrilla in @entity49 ' in 1975			2
" it took @entity1 a while to get over that -- but he was a nice guy and there is a strong sense of nostalgia about him passing , he is very much part of the fabric of @entity25 fight history			2
" the likes of @entity3 , @entity1 , @entity60 and @entity61 will go down in history as some of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time and @entity10 concedes that when they were all at the top of their game in the 1970 's , the division was stronger than it has ever been			1
" i think most people would probably put @entity1 in the top 10 heavyweights of all time , " continued @entity10			1
" he had a fantastic left hook with which he not only knocked @entity3 down but broke his jaw in the first fight			2
" but that was a tremendous heavyweight generation			0
if you won the world title back then , you did so against very good fighters			0
@entity1 took the title off @entity80 , who was a good fighter and lost it to @entity60 -- who we all know about too			2
" there have been other great generations			0
@entity87 reinvigorated the division in the late 1980s , @entity86 was a huge player and @entity89 was a superb champion as well			0
" but at times like this you do look back with a sense of nostalgia and romance			0
looking back it probably was n't too romantic , because it was a tough time , but that 's the mood in @entity25 at the moment			0
" not only was @entity1 a world class fighter , but @entity10 knew him as a kindly man , who sadly ended up in some poverty towards the end of his life			1
" @entity1 was a much simpler , straight - forward character than @entity3			2
he liked the social life and had 11 children but unfortunately he was let down in a land deal which would have made him financially comfortable for life			0
" @entity10 added : " he was a little resentful towards the end of his struggles with money			2
he was the one who did n't make as much as @entity3 and @entity60 , who were the only two men to beat him , and was somewhat overshadowed from the public perspective by his relationship with @entity3			0
" but he was a formidable fighter in his own right and will always be remembered as the first man to beat @entity3			0
that has bookmarked his place in history			0

@entity1 will always be associated with his epic trilogy of fights against @entity3
respected boxing journalist @entity10 knew @entity1 both inside and outside the boxing ring
@entity10 believe @entity1 will go down in history as one of the top 10 heavyweights of all time
