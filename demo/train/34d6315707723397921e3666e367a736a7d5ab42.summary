-- why do we watch ? @entity2 says athletes like @entity4 show us the difference between ordinary effort and excellence			1
the question applies not just to sunday 's @entity9 , although that is the immediate case in point			0
the outcome of the game is not important -- few people remember who wins the @entity9 from year to year			0
the players , while attempting to win , do it with barely concealed smiles on their faces			0
all - star weekend is mostly a class reunion for basketball 's elite			1
but all the games , in all the seasons , in all the big - time sports leagues -- what is the real reason we keep on watching ? you might think that we 'd finally grow weary of caring , with headlines about @entity32 and @entity33 , with the sports pages often reading like the business pages ( contract disputes and stadium bond - issue negotiations and salary arbitration ) , with police - blotter details sometimes pushing aside the box scores			1
why do we watch ? the answer may be found in a single sentence written by a man who died at the age of 76 in this still - new year			1
@entity45 , his literary brilliance aside , was prolific almost beyond belief -- he wrote more than 50 books , and hundreds upon hundreds of essays , short stories , articles , poems and works of criticism			1
all those careful words , year after year , decade after decade			0
but of all the sentences @entity45 ever wrote , there is one that i have long encouraged people to carry around with them -- if not literally tucked into their wallets , then somewhere in their heads and in their hearts			0
in that sentence of @entity45 's lies the secret to a lot of things -- including the secret that answers : why do we watch ? the sentence appeared in @entity45 's 1960 nonfiction piece about @entity73 's last game for the @entity74			1
that piece is famous for how @entity45 explained @entity73 's refusal to come out of the dugout and acknowledge the cheering , crying fans after his home run in his final at - bat : " gods do not answer letters			1
" but it is another sentence in the story that explains everything -- not just about sports , but about the lives the rest of us can lead			1
referring to @entity73 , @entity45 wrote : " for me , @entity73 is the classic ballplayer of the game on a hot august weekday , before a small crowd , when the only thing at stake is the tissue - thin difference between a thing done well and a thing done ill. " there it is , right there			1
that tissue - thin difference , when you do n't necessarily know anyone is watching -- there is the answer			2
we all face the choice in our lives every day : to make the extra effort or not , to stay at the desk for the extra fifteen minutes or to go home , to revise the project one more time before handing it in or to settle for something acceptable , if not quite excellent			2
on fields of play -- baseball diamonds , football fields , a basketball court like the one on which sunday 's @entity9 will be held -- the tissue - thin difference is there for the world to see			2
the lights are dazzlingly bright ; the television cameras carry the close - ups around the globe			2
if a player is dogging it , we can tell ; if a player is jogging instead of sprinting , it 's self - evident ; if a player 's mind is already at the party that will be held after the final buzzer , we know			2
yet once in a while -- we can see it in a player 's eyes -- we are rewarded			0
once in a while , sometimes when we are least expecting to witness it , it 's there : a tiny move , an all - but - imperceptible lunge , an additional thrust , a reach beyond that which should by all reason be reachable			2
it was true during small and glorious moments in the days when @entity156 and @entity157 were on the basketball court ; it is true during small and glorious moments today , when @entity161 and @entity4 are on the court			0
@entity45 's tissue - thin difference			0
a thing done well , when the player could have gotten away with a thing done ill. are the rest of us the same as the players on the court ? in most ways , no. we lack their athletic skill , their physical grace , their monetary riches			0
they hear cheers every working night ; we toil in silence			0
and yet , the one way in which we can be the same , or at least strive to , is in that pursuit of the tissue - thin difference			1
the thing that makes the best of them different is the thing that offers us , too , the potential to earn that difference -- the effort beyond mere effort , the desire beyond standard - issue desire , the pride so strong that it becomes the definition of pride			1
why do we watch ? we watch for those moments			0
they may be fleeting ; they may come and go so quickly we 're not even certain , for an instant , that we actually saw them			0
but they 're real , and they can be ours			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : what explains why @entity208 watch sports so intently ?
he says professional athletes *depress* us with *steroid* and *scandal* stories
@entity2 : we watch for the *greatness* the greatest athletes can achieve
he says it *reflects* the top - *flight* effort everyone can strive to contribute
