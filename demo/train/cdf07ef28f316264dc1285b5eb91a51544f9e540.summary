it was in a @entity3 cab			2
that 's when @entity6 - winning signer @entity5 realized the extent that " fear - bola " had spread			1
" the driver just asked , ' where are you from ? ' of course i have an accent , and i 'm not going to hide the fact that i 'm from @entity14			2
then he said , ' @entity15 ' , and i said , ' do i look like i have @entity15 ? ' " later , when announcing her recently wrapped up @entity19 tribute to @entity21 singer @entity20 , aka , @entity20 , the trolls came out again			1
" it should be @entity23 , " one wrote , and " i wonder if she is bringing any @entity25 ( sic ) with her ? " chimed in another			2
" until that point , i felt the hysteria of it , but i kept saying to myself , ' it 's just the media			1
' then it comes to you direct			2
" overall , she 's not been impressed with how the @entity35 media has covered the epidemic			1
in her opinion , the current coverage represents a tragically lost opportunity			2
" i thought @entity15 would bring greater journalism , that they 'd write about the need for great nurses and great doctors , or how every human being on this planet has the right to a good healthcare system , " she confesses			1
clearly , she 's been disappointed			1
" i hoped they 'd show the beauty of the people			2
but it 's much more dramatic and more entertaining to show us dying			1
" in typical @entity5 fashion , she channeled her outrage into advocacy , and penned a @entity59 op - ed. that is how the @entity61 - born singer - songwriter operates			1
when something makes her angry , she speaks out			2
in 2006 , she was nearly dragged off stage at a concert in @entity65 when she criticized the regime of president @entity67			2
earlier this year , in a @entity1 interview with @entity69 , she expressed her contempt for @entity72 's anti-gay laws			1
as a @entity74 goodwill ambassador ( a role she 's held since 2002 ) , she 's campaigned heavily for @entity76 and hiv prevention			1
her critics are quick to dismiss her , and some have spread rumors that she is gay , or @entity77 positive , in an attempt to discredit her			2
" if you search me in the @entity83 , i am listed as homosexual			2
i say well , it does n't really matter to me			0
if it helps you understand that a homosexual has the same rights as any other human being , fine			0
if you think that me having @entity77 can help people protect themselves , then i will take that			0
i can not be stopped by those things , because every time you keep silent , somebody dies , and we do n't have endless resources of human beings			0
" later this week , @entity5 will tackle another one of her passions -- female empowerment -- at a concert at @entity103 's @entity102			1
she will perform songs from her latest album , @entity105 , which she made as a tribute to her mother ( for whom the album is named ) and to women in general			0
" we woman around the globe , we carry the world on our back			0
we build society , " she says			0
of course , it was n't always easy for @entity5 growing up as an outspoken woman in @entity61 -- a country which adheres to traditional gender roles			1
" some people look at you like you 're a piece of meat , or they think because you 're a woman or a girl , you do n't have a brain , " she admits			0
@entity5 's house , however , was atypical			1
her mother taught the boys to cook , and her father valued female independence			1
" my father used to say , ' sexism is cowardice , it 's insecurity , ' " she recalls			1
@entity5 will be playing @entity102 's @entity131 on 14th november as a part of the @entity133			1
questions from readers we asked and you delivered			0
@entity5 answers questions from @entity1 readers			1
what advice do you have for @entity21 women in the western world ? how can we keep a balance between western culture and our roots ? well , when you go somewhere , you come with your culture , right ? the balance you find is how you bring it to the table			0
it does n't matter where i go , i 'm always going to be an @entity21 woman			0
i take what i need to strengthen myself , to move forward and grow as a human being			0
but i ai n't giving away my culture and identity for anything in this world -- never			0
what does " @entity158 " [ the name of one of your songs ] mean ? @entity163 is a word that i made up			0
when i was in high school , and boys would insult me or make stupid comments , like " come here and clear my food " , i 'd turn back and say , " batonga " , which for me means , " take a hike ! get off my back			0
i do what i want and i will be whoever i decide to be , despite your stupidity			0
do you have @entity179 roots ? yes , from my grandfather			0
he came from slave descendants			0
what singers inspired you the most growing up ? one day a friend of my brother 's brought over a @entity20 album and it was the first time i saw a black woman on the cover of an album			1
before that , i only saw white females , white males and black males on vinyl covers			0
when you start doing things , you want somebody who looks like you to be doing it too , to get the courage to do it			0
that 's when i started thinking that one day , if i do n't become a human rights lawyer , i will become a singer , like her .			1
