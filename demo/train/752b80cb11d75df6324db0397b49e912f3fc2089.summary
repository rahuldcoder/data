it shows what life is like when people are presented with no choices			0
" @entity8 issued a scathing warning to @entity48 on friday , saying via its state news agency , @entity208 , that @entity211 should " stop recklessly working for staging a comeback on @entity8 , depending on its @entity3 master			1
