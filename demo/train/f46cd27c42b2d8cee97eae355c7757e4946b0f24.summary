-- the @entity2 's general counsel said wednesday that @entity3 's is an employer			1
this might not seem like surprising news , but the @entity2 directive has the potential to shake up an industry that profits handsomely by shifting responsibility for workers onto franchisees			1
before , if there were a labor violation in a restaurant , @entity13 could just say : " well , take it with up with the franchise boss			0
it 's not our problem			0
" the fast - food industry 's modern - day sharecropping model often results in wage theft and unfair labor practices , but -- with corporate parents skirting responsibility for conditions they actually control -- leaves low - wage workers holding the bag			1
this is also common practice in other contracted sectors like agriculture , janitorial , garment and construction			0
across our economy , some version of corporate outsourcing , like franchising , is increasingly the norm			0
other methods of outsourcing are multiple layers of contractors , using staffing or temp firms to supply workers , and misclassifying employees as independent contractors			0
the companies thus distance themselves from the labor aspects of their businesses and in so doing , attempt to skip their accountability for front - line workers elsewhere			0
while this restructuring of employment arrangements may be the reality of work today , it does n't have to -- and should not -- spell the end of living wage jobs or business responsibility for the work and workers these corporate giants control			2
placing responsibility where it should lie , as the general counsel 's decision does , is an essential ingredient of a sustainable economy in which people who work for a living can earn a decent living			0
fast - food jobs are not simply rites of passage for teens , they are real jobs families rely on to get by			1
seventy percent of fast food workers are adults 20 or older , more than a quarter are raising kids , and one - third have post-high - school education			2
yet , despite industry growth and rising profits , fast - food jobs are among the country 's lowest - paying			1
average front - line hourly pay is $ 8.69 , with many jobs paying at or near minimum wage			0
many fast - food workers get only part - time hours even though they need full - time work			1
roughly 87 % receive no employer - provided health benefits , and more than half of the families of front - line workers must rely on taxpayer - funded safety net programs to make ends meet			2
these conditions have fueled fast - food worker strikes in every corner of the country and protests around the globe			1
earlier this year , workers in @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 filed class action lawsuits against @entity13 and its franchisees , seeking back pay for alleged wage theft			0
these lawsuits name @entity3 's as a defendant because of strong evidence that it exerts substantial control over the operations of the franchise restaurants , leaving them little room to make decisions			1
in particular , the fast - food giant owns all real estate in its franchised restaurants and charges high rents and royalty fees			1
it imposes take - it - or - leave - it franchise agreements on franchisees , among other things , requiring them to install company - supplied computer software that tracks data about sales , inventory , and labor costs			0
these tight controls and oversight can make it difficult for franchisees to run profitably : a 2007 franchiser - commissioned study found that franchisees had higher default rates on @entity146 loans than non-franchisees			0
when companies like @entity3 's intervene to such an extent in operations , they should be held responsible along with their franchisees for operations that are not above board			2
but too many of these corporate parents evade responsibility			0
holding lead companies like @entity3 's accountable will not portend the death of franchising , as the @entity161 argues			2
it simply means that corporations that exercise sufficient control over franchised operations can not feign ignorance or disclaim responsibility for franchisees ' illegal acts , especially when those acts flow from the business model the lead company imposes			2
the more realistic and balanced arrangement for all stakeholders -- the corporate parent , franchisee , front - line workers , consumers and the economy overall -- requires that @entity3 's and other outsourcers ensure that their franchised operations operate as law - abiding businesses that treat workers fairly			1
at its most basic level , such accountability means ensuring that franchisees understand what the law requires			0
but it also means that when a franchisee cheats workers of wages they have earned , the workers should have recourse against the corporate parent as well			1
too much is at stake for our economy and our society to allow companies like @entity3 's to use franchise and outsourcing agreements that seek to maximize control and profits for them , while absolving them of responsibility for workers and their livelihoods			1
in holding @entity3 's jointly liable with its franchisees , the general counsel 's decision seeks to put an end to this charade .			2

@entity2 just ruled @entity3 's is an employer and must take responsibility for workers
***writers*** : the fast - food industry often hands over responsibility for workers to its franchisees
***writers*** : this means it 's *immune* from problems with workers at their restaurants
***writers*** : now if franchisee cheats , workers have recourse against corporate parent
