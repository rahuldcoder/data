-- oil company @entity1 shouldered some responsibility for the @entity4 oil disaster wednesday after an internal investigation of the spill , but assigned much of the blame to contractors @entity8 and @entity9			1
faulty cementing , a misread pressure test and an improperly maintained blowout preventer all contributed to the april 20 explosion that killed 11 workers aboard the @entity16 drill rig and led to the worst oil spill in @entity19 history , @entity1 's nearly 200 - page report on the disaster concluded			1
" the team did not identify any single action or inaction that caused this accident , " @entity1 's report states			1
" rather , a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures , human judgments , engineering design , operational implementation and team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident			2
multiple companies , work teams and circumstances were involved over time			0
" both @entity8 and @entity9 sharply disputed the findings , with @entity9 calling them " self - serving " and @entity8 insisting that the problem lay with @entity1 's well design			1
in a corporate statement , @entity8 said the report contained " a number of substantial omissions and inaccuracies			1
" " @entity8 remains confident that all the work it performed with respect to the @entity52 well was completed in accordance with @entity1 's specifications for its well construction plan and instructions , and that it is fully indemnified under its contract for any of the allegations contained in the report , " the company said			1
a @entity8 engineer also criticized @entity1 's well design during an august hearing by the @entity64 - @entity63 board investigating the disaster			1
but in a statement accompanying the report , outgoing @entity1 chief @entity66 said the well design was not the issue			2
" based on the report , it would appear unlikely that the well design contributed to the incident , as the investigation found that the hydrocarbons flowed up the production casing through the bottom of the well , " he said			2
in july , @entity66 said the disaster " was the result of multiple equipment errors and human error involving many companies			0
" @entity84 , who is replacing @entity66 , said wednesday 's report " makes that conclusion even clearer			2
" @entity1 's report also found " potential weaknesses " in @entity9 's maintenance of the rig 's blowout preventer , the massive fail - safe device that failed to shut down the well after the explosion			1
@entity1 said its team aboard the doomed platform " incorrectly accepted " results of a negative pressure test on the rig before the blast and mistakenly rejected equipment that cement contractor @entity8 requested to complete the well 's casing			1
rep. @entity103 , the head of a congressional subcommittee also investigating the spill , said the report was no " mea culpa " on @entity1 's part			1
" of their own eight key findings , they only explicitly take responsibility for half of one , " said @entity103 , @entity109			0
" @entity1 is happy to slice up blame , as long as they get the smallest piece			2
" several other investigations are still going on , including probes by @entity121 and the @entity122			0
retired coast guard adm. @entity123 , the @entity125 administration 's point man for the disaster , said the @entity1 report was " not the be-all and end - all " on the matter			2
" i would just say the more we know about this event in general , the better off we are , " @entity123 told reporters wednesday			0
" it 'll add to a larger body of evidence that , or body of work , that might be , wo n't be completed until we finish the joint investigation by the @entity63 and @entity140 , and the other various investigations that are going on			0
" and @entity142 , a spokesman for the @entity144 - based @entity143 , largely dismissed the report			0
" while any investigation headed up by @entity1 has as much credibility as my 3 - year - old daughter 's nightly assertions that it 's not bedtime yet , @entity1 cops to much , but not all here , " @entity142 said in a statement issued wednesday afternoon			2
" ultimately , the report is going to be used to bolster @entity1 's case against the other potentially responsible parties , such as @entity9 and @entity8			1
" @entity142 said that while tracking the cause of the explosion is important , " fighting the last war wo n't necessarily prepare us for the next , inevitable mess			0
" as the well owner , @entity1 is responsible for the cleanup and has set aside a $ 20 billion escrow fund to pay for damages			0
but @entity1 , @entity8 and @entity9 have repeatedly pointed fingers at one another over the cause of the explosion , which resulted in an estimated 4.9 million barrels ( 205 million gallons ) of oil spilling into the @entity4 over 87 days			1
in wednesday 's report , @entity1 said its team aboard the rig misread a critical pressure test in the hours before the explosion			1
" in retrospect , pressure readings and volume bled at the time of the negative - pressure test were indications of flow - path communication with the reservoir , signifying that the integrity of these barriers had not been achieved , " the report states			0
" the @entity9 rig crew and @entity1 well site leaders reached the incorrect view that the test was successful and that well integrity had been established			1
" neither of @entity1 's well site leaders , @entity190 and @entity191 , has appeared before the investigative board			1
@entity190 has invoked his fifth amendment rights against self - incrimination , while @entity191 was excused for medical reasons			0
@entity1 's investigation found that @entity8 used a " likely unstable " cement mix that was not fully tested before it was used			1
@entity198 , @entity1 's head of safety and operations , said in a video accompanying the report that @entity8 " did not conduct comprehensive lab tests that could 've identified potential problems with the cement			1
" but he added , " we believe that @entity1 and @entity8 working together should have better identified and addressed the issues underlying the cement job			2
" but @entity8 engineer @entity209 testified in august that he warned @entity1 that its well design was inadequate			1
appearing before the investigative board , @entity209 said he told @entity1 that the well design did not have enough centralizers -- devices used to position the cement casing around the well bore			2
the design called for six centralizers , but @entity209 recommended 21 because of the " severe gas flow problem " in the well			0
@entity1 engineer @entity220 replied by e-mail that " it was too late and we had to deal with what we had on the rig , " @entity209 testified			0
in addition , e-mails from @entity1 engineers , released by a congressional committee in june , suggest that the oil company had its own concerns about the well			0
drilling engineer @entity220 called it a " nightmare well which has everyone all over the place , " while @entity232 called it " a crazy well			0
" both @entity232 and @entity220 invoked their fifth amendment rights against self - incrimination during the most recent round of hearings by the investigative board			0
eventually , 15 more centralizers were shipped to the rig			0
@entity1 's well team " erroneously believed that they had received the wrong centralizers " and decided not to use them , according to wednesday 's report -- but the decision not to use them " likely did not contribute to the cement 's failure to isolate the main hydrocarbon zones or to the failure of the shoe track cement			1
" @entity1 's report also faults @entity9 's crew for failing " to recognize and act on the influx of hydrocarbons into the well until the hydrocarbons were in the riser and rapidly flowing to the surface			1
" " indications of influx with an increase in drill pipe pressure are discernible in real - time data from approximately 40 minutes before the rig crew took action to control the well , " the report states			0
" the rig crew 's first apparent well control actions occurred after hydrocarbons were rapidly flowing to the surface			0
" in its response , @entity9 said @entity1 made decisions that increased the chances that flammable gas would come flowing out of the well			2
it also failed to run a common test on the integrity of the cement or to employ a " lockdown sleeve " that would have helped contain the eventual blowout , it said .			0

new : @entity8 says @entity1 's report has " substantial omissions and inaccuracies "
report lays much of the blame on contractors @entity8 and @entity9
@entity1 says its own team " incorrectly accepted " test results
