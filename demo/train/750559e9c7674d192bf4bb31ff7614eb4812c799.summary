@entity0 , @entity1 -- the original judge has been dead for 15 years , and no one has been able to find the criminal case file since 2004			1
yet a 1977 sex scandal involving famed director @entity7 and a 13 - year - old girl continues to stalk the courts of @entity0			1
@entity11 - winning director @entity7 has n't left @entity12 in 30 years because of a @entity14 fugitive warrant			1
attorneys for the 75 - year - old @entity11 - winning director asked a judge tuesday to put the matter to rest once and for all			1
but a judge denied the request , saying the director must show up in court to obtain a ruling			1
that poses problems for @entity27 because prosecutors have vowed to seek his arrest on a bench warrant the minute he sets foot in the @entity14			1
the bench warrant was issued when @entity7 failed to appear for sentencing more than 30 years ago			1
lawyers @entity33 and @entity35 last month filed a 239 - page dismissal " request , " citing allegations brought to light in the documentary , " @entity7 : wanted and @entity41			1
" the documentary was first broadcast in june on @entity43 , which shares a corporate parent with @entity2			0
the court filing alleges that a meddling prosecutor who believed @entity7 should be behind bars improperly influenced a judge to ignore the terms of a plea bargain , as well as the wishes of the district attorney 's office , the probation officer and the victim			1
none of them wanted @entity7 to serve jail time			1
@entity60 judge @entity59 left the door open to reconsider his ruling if @entity7 , who has lived in exile in @entity12 since 1977 , shows up in court			1
" it 's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct , " @entity65 said in court			0
but he declined to dismiss the case entirely , a decision that did n't surprise legal experts who said such rulings are extremely rare			2
" you have to give [ @entity7 attorney ] @entity35 the creative lawyering of the year award , " said legal analyst @entity75 , a professor at @entity76 in @entity0			1
@entity65 in effect said he was tossing out the request without considering whether it has merit because @entity7 has n't shown up for court			1
but he suspended his ruling , writing that " if the defendant submits to the jurisdiction of this @entity60 within 30 days , the court shall consider the merits of the motion			2
" @entity7 's victim is among those calling for the case to be tossed out			1
@entity94 , the victim 's lawyer , said he was disappointed in the ruling and that @entity65 " did not get to the merits and consider the clear proof of both judicial and prosecutorial corruption			0
" he argued in court that had " mr. @entity7 been treated fairly " his client would not still be suffering because of publicity almost 32 years after the incident			2
@entity75 said the victim 's support may offer a sliver of hope for @entity7			2
" the best thing he has going is the victim , " she said			0
" in this age of victims ' rights , if i were the lawyer i would be playing that card too			0
" but prosecutors have consistently argued that dismissing the @entity7 case would be a miscarriage of justice , allowing a man who " drugged and raped a 13 - year - old child " to go free			1
@entity7 's attorneys back up the allegation with a dvd of the documentary , a script , a copy of @entity7 's 1977 pre-sentencing report and various court transcripts , interviews and declarations			1
they paint a picture of backroom conversations between a prosecutor itching for a piece of the case and a judge so image conscious that he kept a scrapbook of media clippings , asked lawyers to " stage " @entity7 's sentencing hearing and feared criticism if he did n't send the director to prison			1
allegations of prosecutorial and judicial misconduct are commonly raised on appeal , but only a small percentage of these appeals succeed			0
@entity7 pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor			1
the director , his lawyer and the prosecutor handling the case believed they 'd hammered out a deal that would spare the young victim a public trial and @entity7 jail time , according to the filing			1
the first surprise came when judge @entity164 sent @entity7 to prison for " diagnostic testing " to determine whether he was what then was called a " mentally disturbed sex offender			1
" ( the results came in after @entity7 spent 42 days at a maximum security prison			2
) the second surprise came on the eve of sentencing , when @entity164 informed the attorneys that he was inclined to send @entity7 back to prison for another 48 days			1
@entity27 fled the @entity14 and has been living in exile in @entity12 ever since			1
previous attempts to resolve the case failed , including a recently disclosed secret negotiation in 1997			1
the sticking point has always been @entity7 's refusal to come to court because he would face almost certain arrest the moment he set foot in the @entity14			1
as a director , @entity7 is best known for the films " @entity188 , " " @entity189 " and " @entity190 , " a 2002 drama about the @entity192 that won him the @entity11 for best director			1
but he is also known for a personal life tinged with tragedy			0
he was born in @entity12 and moved to @entity196 with his parents as a small child			0
later , he escaped @entity201 's @entity200 ghetto and hid from the @entity202 with the help of strangers			0
his mother died at @entity206			0
he endured the anti-semitism of post-war @entity208 , attended film school and directed " @entity210 , " which won a 1963 @entity11 nomination for best foreign - language film			0
he then came to @entity1 to make " @entity188			0
" as he was making his mark in @entity214 , @entity7 was also making headlines in connection with two lurid @entity0 crimes in the 1960s and ' 70s			1
@entity7 was filming in @entity208 when members of @entity221 's " family " butchered the director 's pregnant wife , actress @entity224 , and four others in august 1969			1
eight years later , he stood accused of plying a 13 - year - old girl with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts , including intercourse , with her during a photo shoot at actor @entity234 's house			2
@entity234 was not at home , but his girlfriend at the time , actress @entity237 , was			0
according to a probation report contained in the filing , @entity238 described the victim as " sullen			0
" she added , " she appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25			0
she did not look like a 13 - year - old scared little thing			0
" @entity238 said @entity7 did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl			2
" i do n't think he 's a bad man , " she said in the report			0
" i think he 's an unhappy man			0
" as she has from the beginning , the victim says @entity27 should n't go to prison			0
@entity256 , now 45 , married and a mother of three children , sued @entity7 and received an undisclosed settlement			2
she long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly , she said , because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled			2
earlier this month she filed a court declaration accusing prosecutors of victimizing her yet again by publicizing graphic details of the sexual encounter			2
the makers of the documentary also talked with people who played roles behind the scenes			0
from those interviews , the tale of alleged backroom dealings emerged			0
former prosecutor @entity275 was regularly assigned to @entity164 's @entity277 courtroom			0
he handled routine matters and told the filmmakers he had the judge 's ear			2
" i was in the court every day , " he said in an interview with the filmmakers			0
" so @entity164 [ would ] ask me questions about the thing because he counted on me , or whoever was his favorite @entity288 at the time , to advise him on what the -- what the law was , criminal law			0
he was very good at civil law , but criminally , he left that to his das to do			0
" although he was involved in the early stages of the investigation , @entity275 was taken off the @entity7 case			1
he said he was " miffed " at the way it was handled because he believed @entity7 should go to jail			2
@entity275 recommended the 90 days of diagnostic testing to the judge because @entity7 would be in a prison setting but could n't appeal , he said			1
@entity275 told the filmmakers he showed the judge a photo of the director at an @entity311 celebration while the sentence was pending			2
" i took the picture into @entity164			0
i said , ' judge , ' i said , ' look here			0
he 's flipping you off ... ' and i said , ' have n't you had enough of this ? ' and then he exploded and what happened happened			0
" @entity7 's attorneys said the conversations were improper " ex parte " communications -- and nothing short of prosecutorial misconduct			2
legal ethics and rules of criminal procedure usually bar one party in a case from discussing it with the judge unless the other side is present			2
@entity275 could not be reached for comment			0
his voice mail was full , and was not accepting new messages			0
but he recently told the @entity334 that he did nothing wrong and that he still strongly feels @entity7 should go to prison			2
it will be judge @entity59 's call on how to handle a celebrity case that appears to have been snakebitten from the start			1
@entity2 's @entity341 contributed to this report .			0
