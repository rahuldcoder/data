-- if @entity1 continues with its controversial missile and nuclear tests , it " will move closer " to its objective of reaching the @entity5 with nuclear weapons , according to a @entity8 report			1
during recent heightened tensions on the @entity11 , @entity9 repeatedly threatened the possibility of nuclear attacks against the @entity5 and @entity14 , prompting questions on the progress of its weapons program			0
@entity1 's secretiveness has made it hard for @entity21 intelligence agencies to gauge exactly what is going on inside its research facilities			2
many clues have come from the regime 's large - scale tests such as the long - range rocket launch in december and the underground nuclear detonation in february			0
the @entity8 's annual report to @entity31 on thursday provided an overview of the military threat posed by @entity1 , but it did n't say how long it believed it would take the isolated , @entity35 state to develop a fully operational nuclear missile capable of reaching the @entity5 mainland			1
it described @entity1 's ballistic missile program as " ambitious " and said that " the pace of its progress will depend , in part , on how many resources it can dedicate to these efforts and how often it conducts tests			1
" doubts over @entity1 's capabilities a sign of differing views on @entity1 's nuclear missile capabilities among @entity5 intelligence agencies emerged last month			1
addressing the @entity55 , a congressman read out an excerpt from a report by the @entity8 's intelligence arm that said it believed with " moderate confidence " that the @entity1 had nuclear weapons that could be delivered by ballistic missiles , albeit with low " reliability			1
" but after the disclosure of that assessment from the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) , top @entity5 officials including president @entity64 said the @entity5 government did n't think @entity1 was yet able to fit a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile			0
the @entity8 report thursday included no reference to the @entity67 excerpt , which did n't specify the range of the ballistic missiles that it was talking about			2
the report said that the type of long - range rocket that @entity1 launched in december to put a satellite in orbit " could reach parts of the @entity5 if configured as an intercontinental ballistic missile ( @entity80 ) capable of carrying a nuclear payload			2
" but it noted that " a space launch does not test a re-entry vehicle ( @entity89 ) , without which @entity1 can not deliver a weapon to target from an icbm			0
" the december launch and the display in april 2012 of an untested but road - mobile intercontinental ballistic missile help underscore " the threat to regional stability and @entity5 national security posed by @entity1 , " according to the report			2
like father , like son its authors said they did n't expect much change under @entity1 leader , @entity105 , from the strategy shaped by his father , @entity107 , who died in december 2011			1
the focus of that approach , they said , includes " coercive diplomacy to compel acceptance of its diplomatic , economic and security interests ; development of strategic military capabilities to deter external attack ; " and challenges to @entity14 and the @entity5 - @entity14 alliance			0
under @entity105 , @entity1 has so far continued the pursuit of more advanced nuclear and missile technologies , which according to the report , the regime sees as " essential to its goals of survival , sovereignty and relevance			1
" the long - range rocket launch in december and underground nuclear test in february prompted international condemnation and tougher @entity132 sanctions			0
those measures were followed by intensified threats from @entity9 , during which the @entity5 said it would deploy additional missile defenses on its @entity137			0
the @entity8 report also highlighted the murkiness of the @entity1 's decision - making processes -- a particular concern during periods of heightened tensions like the past few months			1
" although @entity1 is unlikely to attack on a scale that it assesses would risk the survival of its government by inviting overwhelming counterattacks by the @entity14 or the @entity5 , we do not know how @entity1 calculates this threshold of behavior , " the report said , using the abbreviated form of @entity14 's official name , the @entity14			0
" @entity1 's use of smallscale attacks and provocative acts leaves much room for miscalculation that could spiral into a larger conflict , " it said			2
@entity0 's @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
