she did n't have enough power to maneuver and effectively trade artillery rounds with enemy vessels in the swift @entity4			2
instead , the locally produced @entity7 , a one - of - a - kind ironclad produced for the @entity5 during the @entity6 , became a stationary floating battery , bristling with artillery pieces			1
the @entity11 , intent on taking @entity4 , @entity7 , refused to take on the @entity7 or other nearby defense obstructions			1
the @entity7 won the battle , but lost the war : the vessel was scuttled in december 1864 shortly before @entity18 forces took @entity4 and presented the city to president @entity20 as a @entity22 present			1
the shipwreck has rested in the murky river since , rarely disturbed and having weathered the indignity of being hit during dredging a couple of times over the years			2
@entity29 sailors laid to rest 150 years later this week , @entity31 divers , working with archaeologists for the @entity33 , retrieved a 64 - square - foot section of the ironclad , a precursor to the long - anticipated removal and preservation of the shipwreck so the city 's vital shipping channel can be deepened			1
@entity41 expects to spend an estimated $ 9.5 million on the project			2
the removal is expected to begin in summer 2014 , although funding has not been finalized			0
" over time the ship 's casemate , the iron - covered upper portion of the warship , came apart , " the @entity45 said in a statement wednesday			0
" the small portion removed tuesday will give archaeologists the ability to assess the condition of the remainder of the ship			0
" @entity58 found on @entity60 floor while thousands watched that remainder includes remaining cannon , pieces of the ship 's power plant and propeller shaft and two chunks of the casemate			0
officials are excited because the recovery of the casemates -- the compartments where artillery pieces were housed -- is believed to be the first of a @entity5 ironclad			1
one of the surviving casemates is huge : 68 feet by 24 feet			0
full moon gets partial blame for @entity6 general 's death divers , who have only a few feet of visibility , have been assessing the @entity7 wreck , so they know what they will be facing next summer			1
the site is adjacent to @entity88 and the main shipping channel			1
" this is just a small section			0
it was not cut off , " corps public affairs specialist @entity91 said of the piece recovered tuesday			0
" it was a small piece they found that would be the most viable to pull up			0
" archaeologists have the challenge of preserving the @entity7 through chemical and other means , making her iron stable so that the remains one day can be displayed in museums			1
this 5,000 - pound chunk of casemate , lifted by crane onto a barge , is being sent to @entity110 for archaeological testing , @entity105 said			0
@entity6 heirlooms bond families with past the remains of the @entity7 may answer some mysteries , including its dimensions and the manner of construction			1
the casemates were made of railroad iron			0
the vessel could handle 10 guns , though fewer were onboard when it was destroyed			0
there are no known blueprints for the ironclad , which was produced in @entity4 in 1862 as part of a defensive naval squadron			2
its wreckage straddles the borders of @entity7 and @entity131			1
according to the @entity33 , @entity4 's harbor will be deepened from 42 feet to 47 feet , " greatly expanding its capability to handle larger cargo vessels			2
" the ongoing expansion of the @entity136 means bigger ships will need deeper water at ports around the @entity140			0
if things go as planned , the remains of the @entity7 and associated artifacts will be on the surface before the 150th anniversary of its sinking			1

the @entity7 never fired a shot in anger during the @entity6
she was scuttled rather than left to fall into @entity18 hands during the war
now the ironclad must be moved so a shipping channel can be deepened
