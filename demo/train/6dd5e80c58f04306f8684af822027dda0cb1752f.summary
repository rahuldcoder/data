@entity0 , @entity1 -- revolutionary forces attacked loyalist strongholds friday in a failed attempt to snuff out continuing resistance from forces loyal to ousted @entity1 leader @entity8			1
in the fallen leader 's hometown of @entity15 , along the @entity12 coast , @entity10 fighters pulled back friday night after a day of chaotic , fierce street fighting			2
the number of casualties was unclear			0
a brigade of fighters from @entity21 wrested control of the @entity24 military base and a civilian airport near the western edge of @entity15 , according to the @entity27			2
@entity28 , a spokesman to the @entity27 , said seven @entity10 fighters were killed and 31 wounded in friday 's fighting in @entity15			1
from the central city , @entity10 fighters retreated to the outskirts after troops loyal to @entity8 put up strong resistance			2
expected support from residents of @entity15 did not materialize as loyalists fought house to house with an intensity that had not been anticipated			2
revolutionary forces said they would try again saturday			0
one of @entity8 's sons , @entity42 , the regime 's national security adviser , may have been coordinating the fighting in @entity15 , according to @entity45 , a revolutionary fighter			1

meanwhile , in neighboring @entity64 , the government refused to heed the demand of @entity1 's @entity66 that it hand over regime officials who had fled there , including another of @entity8 's sons			1
@entity71 arrived sunday in @entity64 , accompanied by eight regime officials " of minor importance , " @entity64 justice minister @entity70 said this week			1

the @entity64 government believes @entity8 's family and loyalists could face the death penalty if they are returned to @entity1 , @entity70 said			1

" i think our estimation is that there 's no indication that he 's left @entity1 , " he told reporters friday			0
" i think what 's perfectly clear is that that regime has collapsed , that they control very , very little territory in @entity1			0
the opposition has fully consolidated control of @entity0 , for instance , and other major population centers			0
so we 're confident that the @entity8 regime has come to an end , but we 'll continue to work with the @entity122 as they seek to bring @entity8 to justice			0
