@entity0 was back in the mix as a grand slam contender after a superb 2014 season			1
he reached the @entity6 final -- taking the world no. 1 @entity7 to five sets -- and ended the campaign by helping @entity11 to a maiden @entity13 title			0
but did all the tennis last year cost @entity0 -- and his 33 - year - old body -- at the @entity16 this year ? was it a hand injury that he sustained earlier this week ? or was his opponent simply too good ? no matter what the potential reasons , the end result is that @entity0 will have to wait for a record - extending 18th grand slam title after he lost to @entity24 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 5 ) 4 - 6 7 - 6 ( 5 ) in the third round in @entity26 on friday			1
there were no such troubles for @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
that @entity24 was the man who knocked out @entity0 was a surprise -- in their 10 previous matches , the @entity32 had never won			1
he had claimed just one set			0
and against tennis ' big three of @entity0 , @entity7 and @entity29 , @entity24 owned a dismal 1 - 25 record			1
but the world no. 46 played one of his best matches , crucially not crumbling when the finish line was in sight			0
instead it was @entity0 who blinked in the fourth - set tiebreak			1
he led 3 - 1 only to double fault at 3 - 2			2
then leading 5 - 4 , @entity0 made a costly backhand unforced error			1
@entity0 rued missed opportunities in the second set tiebreak , too , when @entity24 was there for the taking			1
" it just broke me to lose that second set , " @entity0 told reporters			1
" and actually the fourth , i should win it , too			0
just a brutal couple of sets to lose there			0
" @entity24 completed the upset in stunning fashion , scrambling before hitting an instinctive forehand passing shot winner down the line			1
" for sure it was one of the important shots of my life , " said @entity24			1
@entity0 thus exited , despite winning more points in the match overall , 145 to 144			2
" i felt for some reason yesterday and this morning it was not going to be very simple today , " @entity0 said			2
" even in practice i still felt the same way			0
" i was just hoping it was one of those feelings you sometimes have and it 's totally not true and you just come out and you play a routine match			0
i was aware of the test and was well prepared			0
" just somehow could n't play my best tennis today			0
it was definitely partially because of @entity82 playing very well			0
" perhaps the warning signs were there from his previous round			2
@entity0 lost a set in the second round to @entity24 's fellow @entity32 , @entity88			1
he -- and this is rare for @entity0 -- called for the trainer to address an issue with his hand			2
@entity0 thought he might have been stung by a bee			2
he did n't mention the hand or any other physical issue in his briefing with reporters			0
@entity0 also defended his decision to play exhibition matches in @entity100 in december during tennis ' notoriously short off - season			1
" i wanted to go to @entity100 , " said @entity0			2
" i wanted to go back to @entity11 for @entity102			0
i practiced as hard as i possibly could			0
" ca n't do more than that			0
sure , the year ended late , but one week later than normal			0
at the end of the day , honestly i 'm confident that what i did was the right thing			0
" @entity0 's exit means @entity30 's path to the semifinals has become significantly easier			1
the two - time grand slam champion and @entity0 were , on paper , due to meet in the quarterfinals			1
while @entity0 was sent packing , @entity30 easily dispatched @entity115 's @entity114 6 - 1 6 - 1 7 - 5			1
@entity30 's performance was n't the only topic of conversation during his press conference , though			2
a particular tweet was mentioned , too			0
after @entity29 visibly struggled on court in the second round and was close to vomiting in his five - set victory over @entity124 , @entity30 appeared to criticize the @entity125 in this tweet : " when i cramped and won in the us open last year i was a ' drama queen , unfit , needs to see a shrink , faker ' weird ... " @entity30 wrote			1
but he insisted friday he was n't targeting @entity29			2
" i did n't watch the whole match the other night , but clearly @entity29 was struggling pretty badly , " @entity30 said			1
" it was a great effort to come through it , which rightly is what everyone was saying			0
" but that certainly was n't the case at the @entity135 when i was in a similar state			0
and yeah , i just do n't understand why that would be the case			0
" @entity29 looked better physically on court after suffering from cramps against @entity124 , eliminating @entity142 's @entity141 6 - 1 6 - 0 7 - 5 under the lights in @entity144			1
he saved all seven break points he faced -- and they all came in the third set			0
he said in an on - court interview that he slept a lot in a bid to recover but did n't budge when asked for a percentage of how he felt physically			2
" uh , i was never very good in mathematics , " @entity29 joked			2
@entity29 and @entity30 were joined in the fourth round by seventh - seed @entity153 and 10th - seed @entity155			1
@entity155 survived @entity157 ' upset bid , edging the charismatic 2006 finalist 4 - 6 6 - 3 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 3			0
winners in the women 's draw included third - seed @entity31 and seventh - seed @entity162 .			1

@entity0 loses to @entity24 at the @entity16
the third - round defeat was his earliest in @entity26 in 14 years
@entity0 was one of the contenders after a strong 2014
