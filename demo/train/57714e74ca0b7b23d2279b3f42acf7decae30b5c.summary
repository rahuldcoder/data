@entity1 's new driverless - car prototype is downright hugable			1
the company unveiled its latest self - driving vehicle on monday , and it looks like a cartoon koala crossed with a smart car wearing a fez			2
unlike the mock - up car @entity1 first shared in may , this version is fully functional			1
it even has real headlights			0
the round , white and gray car is designed without permanent driving tools like a gas pedal or wheel			2
however , to comply with @entity19 state law , there are still removable , temporary controls for the required " safety driver " -- a real person who needs to be in the car and ready to take over in an emergency			1
the goal is to eventually remove any interior controls so that passengers can take a nap or knit while the car does all the work			2
@entity1 's self - driving car team will continue to test the vehicle on a private track in @entity19 , where it works its way around traffic lights and mock construction zones			1
@entity1 has said it 's interested in launching a pilot program for the cars in the coming years			0
when the tech company first started experimenting with self - driving technology , it modified existing cars , like a @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , by adding multiple cameras and sensors and an onboard computer			0
now @entity1 has moved on to making its own car from scratch			2
the car 's dome - like shape is optimal for giving sensors the widest field of view			0
a car could help put people 's minds at ease about the controversial technology			0
before self - driving cars can start ferrying us to work , companies need figure out ethical issues ( does it hit a deer or crash into the median ? ) , improve basic driving functions , and work with governments on legislation to allow driverless cars on all roads			1
@entity1 is just one of many companies developing driverless car technology			1
universities and major auto manufacturers such as @entity79 and @entity80 are working on similar vehicles			0
@entity1 hopes to have its version on the road by the end of the decade .			0

@entity1 *debuted* its new , fully functioning driverless car prototype
the round white car still *includes* temporary manual controls for a back - up driver
while cute , the vehicle still has many serious issues to *address* before it can hit *public* roads
