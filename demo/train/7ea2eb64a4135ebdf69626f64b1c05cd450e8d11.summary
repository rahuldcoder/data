-- there are few careers that can match the pedigree of @entity5 coach @entity4			2
having just set a remarkable nine - year unbeaten home league record -- which spanned 150 matches and four clubs in four different countries -- the @entity11 manager is eyeing yet another remarkable record			2
as he leads his real side in the quarterfinal second leg against @entity15 tonight , @entity4 is on the trail of becoming the first coach to win three @entity19 cups with three different clubs			2
but as the 48 - year - old aims to push his career to the next level , there may be the birth of a new star in his midst			0
it was merely a coincidence that @entity29 clinched their 25th title as @entity5 were shocked by @entity31 at the @entity32 -- @entity4 's first home defeat in nearly a decade -- but what is not coincidental is the way @entity29 have dominated their domestic championship this season			1
in a fashion not seen since the heady days of @entity4 between 2002 and 2004 -- when the self proclaimed " @entity40 " plundered two league titles , the @entity42 and the @entity43 -- the youthful , dynamic and ambitious coach @entity44 has swept all before him			1
will @entity4 's record ever be beaten ? @entity44 is @entity4 's protege and student , but aged just 33 -- seven years younger than @entity4 was when he won his first title with @entity29 -- the question is whether the apprentice can match his former master 's astonishing achievements at the @entity52 do @entity53			1
@entity29 have simply outclassed their rivals this season , winning 23 and drawing the other two of their 25 matches to wrap up the title with five games remaining			2
along the way , they have scored 61 goals and conceding a miserly 11 , and are also through to the quarterfinals of the @entity42 -- a competition @entity4 also won , under its former guise of the @entity42 , in his first full season			2
" i can find similarities between @entity44 and @entity4 in the way they started their careers and the way in which they reached immediate success at @entity29 , " @entity66 , a football commentator for @entity11 - based @entity67 told @entity0			1
" furthermore , both of them were not known as players and started coaching very early on , working with some really well known coaches			0
" @entity79 anchor @entity78 , who has followed the careers of both men closely , is even more forthright in his comparisons of the pair			0
" there is no doubt in my mind that @entity44 is the second coming of @entity4			1
he is is a young , ambitious , disciplined football lunatic , who has soaked up as much knowledge as he can from working with the best coach in the world			0
" it is impossible not to draw comparisons between the two men			0
@entity4 learned his trade working as an interpreter for @entity98 at both @entity29 and @entity99 , picking up tips from the legendary @entity102 coach before eventually impressing with his own coaching acumen			1
@entity44 was also at @entity29 in the mid 1990s			1
at the tender age of 17 , and with no football apprenticeship behind him , his mastery of @entity102 and attention to detail impressed @entity98 so much that the veteran coach hired the teenager to work as part of his scouting and statistics team -- sending him to @entity114 to achieve his first coaching badges			0
and when @entity4 returned to @entity29 , after cutting his managerial teeth at @entity117 , he took @entity118 under his wing , going on to employ the willing student at both @entity121 and @entity122 in exactly the same manner as @entity98 had done with him			1
like @entity4 , @entity44 started his coaching career at a small club			1
leaving his mentor behind in @entity127 , @entity44 took over at bottom of the table @entity130 last season , performing a minor miracle to steer a club , without a win before his arrival , to mid-table respectability			1
@entity29 , looking for a coach after sacking @entity138 following their failure to retain the league title and qualify for the @entity43 , quickly came a-calling -- and @entity44 has more than justified the decision to make him the youngest coach in the @entity11 top flight , with the club suffering just one defeat in all competitions			1
" he has had a very strong impact at the club , in the city and in the region , " continued @entity147			0
" he came in after a disappointing season and immediately asserted himself with a positive and confident attitude			0
" his philosophy is similar to @entity4 when he was at @entity29			1
he likes to play attacking football based on ball possession and forcing opponents into submission and his planning is superb			0
he spends countless hours in his office sourcing information to give to his players			0
" and @entity78 believes @entity161 will go on to even greater success in the coming years			0
" his strength is not only tactical , it is his ability to program players into doing exactly what he tells them to do			0
" his organizational and motivational techniques are so good that players really believe they can do what he tells them			0
" even within the pantheon of great football coaches , there are few who have won titles before their 40th birthday ; even @entity4 fails to make the grade			2
but with @entity161 claiming silverware at such a young age , maybe " master " @entity4 should beware of the burgeoning talent of his pupil .			2

@entity44 is following in the *footsteps* of his mentor @entity4
@entity44 has led @entity29 to the @entity11 title at the age of just 33
@entity4 was seven years older when he won his first league title with the club
both men are motivated , ambitious and superb at organizing their players
