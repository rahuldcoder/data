how happy are consumers with no - contract phones and service ? @entity10 recently released the results of its 2011 @entity4 @entity12			1
the no - contract carriers studied were : @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
this year , the overall winner was @entity15 , which scored top marks for its cost of service , account management practices , initial activation process and offers / promotions			1
however , boost scored only a middling grade on performance and reliability , the characteristic that survey participants rated as most important			2
@entity18 , @entity20 , and @entity21 received consumers ' highest ratings for performance and reliability ; while @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity17 fared worst on this front			2
@entity14 received the overall worst customer satisfaction rating this year , with poor to middling marks in all categories			1
according to @entity45 , a media and marketing services company , as of october of last year , 28 % of all @entity4 cell phone service plans did not have contracts ( up from 21 % in 2008 )			0
meanwhile , @entity48 reports that this year , about half of of all no - contract customers have month - to - month plans , rather than prepaid ones			1
in 2008 , only 30 % of no - contract plans were monthly			1
the increase in attractive monthly no - contract offers might start stealing customers away from contracts			1
@entity48 notes : " among customers currently under [ a regular carrier contract of a year or more ] and who say they are likely to switch their carrier during the next year , nearly 40 percent are likely to choose non-contract service			0
" monthly contracts are generally cheaper			0
according to @entity48 : " monthly non-contract customers spend an average of $ 32 less per month than do customers with contracts			0
monthly non-contract customers spend $ 60 per month , compared with an average monthly service cost of $ 92 for customers with service contracts			0
" some smartphones are now available on no - contract plans			1
most no - contract carriers offer some smartphone deals -- usually for @entity76 phones , but increasingly for @entity77 and some @entity79 models , too			1
these smartphones still cost substantially more to buy up front than the simpler , cheaper " feature phones " these carriers mostly offer , and they generally do n't have the latest or most robust technology or operating system versions			2
whether these offerings will entice many first - time smartphone buyers remains to be seen			0
for example , @entity17 currently offers a no - contract @entity90 touchscreen phone running @entity77 2.1 for $ 129 after a $ 50 instant discount and $ 30 mail - in rebate ; the month - to - month plan cost is $ 50			2
similarly , @entity22 is currently offering the @entity95 ( running @entity77 2.2 ) and @entity96 ( running @entity77 2.1 ) for $ 199.99 , with month - to - month plans starting at $ 25			0
right now , the major @entity4 wireless carriers are making considerable revenue off of smartphone customers under two - year contracts			0
and so far , it 's pretty hard to get a higher - end smartphone without a two - year contract in the @entity4 but lower - end smartphones might suffice for many mobile users			2
that 's why offers such as these could alter the @entity4 wireless competitive landscape over the next few years			0
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity113 .			0

boost @entity15 scored top marks overall among *owners* of no - contract phones
among no - contract carriers , @entity14 got the lowest customer satisfaction rating
a few smartphones are now available on no - contract plans
