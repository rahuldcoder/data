@entity0 -- @entity3 conservatives are putting @entity3 speaker @entity4 on notice : the 2014 agenda needs to be about more than railing on the president and the failures of @entity10			1
they say it 's time to lay out a bold @entity14 vision and hold votes on a series of issues to show a contrast with @entity19			1
" republicans right now think that all we have to do is talk about how bad the @entity28 economy is and how bad @entity10 is and we 're going to win in 2014 , " @entity14 rep. @entity20 told reporters at a forum of @entity3 conservatives on @entity23 this week			1
@entity20 said he believes this strategy is what prevented @entity24 from winning the @entity3 in 2012 and predicted if the party adopts the same game plan this year it wo n't take back the @entity34 or win the @entity3 in 2016			1
@entity36 @entity35 rep. @entity35 , who heads a group of more than 170 conservatives called the @entity39 , also said he 's worried top @entity14 leaders do n't have a more proactive agenda ahead of the midterm elections			1
" there 's some people that think that they might want to play prevent defense this year and sit back , " @entity35 said			1
in rare bipartisan action , @entity47 approves $ 1.1 trillion budget since @entity24 took control of the @entity3 in 2011 , those on the right have wielded their growing numbers and influence to stymie @entity4 's plans on major policy debates			1
as @entity24 head to the eastern shore of @entity60 for a closed - door retreat later this month to chart strategy , @entity58 rep. @entity57 said			1
" this is no time to duck in a foxhole			2
this is the time for @entity24 to lead			2
" @entity4 has said he believes the 2014 election will hinge on jobs and the problems with @entity10			1
@entity3 @entity24 leaders are again expected to push similar versions of the jobs bill they pushed in 2013 to keep the focus on the economy , along with some more bills tweaking @entity10 , according to @entity14 aides			2
but @entity79 rep. @entity78 , a tea party favorite who is retiring this fall , said , " that 's not enough , " and @entity3 @entity24 need to give more concrete answers for what they 'll do for working - class @entity85			2
" you can chew gum and walk at the same time , " @entity78 said			2
@entity28 makes case for not adding sanctions on @entity91 asked about conservatives ' demands for votes on a host of issues , @entity4 agreed in principle , saying at his weekly session with reporters , " it 's important for us as a -- as a party , especially in an election year , to tell people what you 're for			1
" perhaps in response to growing calls from his own members , the speaker committed that @entity3 @entity24 would come forward this year with their own proposal to replace @entity10			0
but he did n't guarantee a vote on it before the election			0
the refrain " repeal and replace " was a central @entity14 message right after the president signed the health care law in 2010			0
although there have been more than 40 votes to roll back the entire law or parts of it , there has been no vote on a plan to take its place			0
but what do conservatives want ? even those republicans demanding a " bold vision " from their leaders are n't articulating what that means			2
several @entity3 conservatives admit there are splits about what should be included on the 2014 to - do list , and that divide could take a while to sort out			2
" this is clearly going to be an internal struggle of the @entity24 : are we going to just be the party that says ' hey the other side is worse ' or are we going to show why our side is actually better for the @entity85 people or the public ? " @entity20 asked			0
he and other conservatives are worried that the national party has become too closely aligned with big business , and instead should be targeting its agenda and message at small businesses and individuals			2
in addition to the party laying out its own health care plan , @entity156 @entity155 rep. @entity155 outlined several areas he said voters want to see @entity47 tackle this year			0
he held up tax reform that helps promote new jobs as a must - do priority , something @entity24 put on their agenda for every new congressional session			0
new spot in ad wars over @entity10 perhaps as a response to the @entity19 ' laser focus this year on income inequality issues , @entity155 said the @entity14 should focus on policies aimed at lower - income @entity85 , suggesting welfare reform should be revisited			1
he also said @entity85 want @entity47 to deal with the worries people have about privacy protections			0
" these are four things that help every single family in this country , " @entity155 said , and insisted leaders should schedule votes on bills covering all those conservative priorities			0
one issue that is guaranteed to set up a clash between conservatives and @entity4 is immigration reform			1
the speaker is expected to release a set of principles on immigration reform later this month			0
he has said repeatedly it 's important for @entity47 to fix the broken system , including addressing what to do about the 11 million undocumented workers in the @entity85			0
@entity4 and other top @entity3 @entity14 leaders are adamant they wo n't take up anything resembling the comprehensive legislation the @entity34 passed last year			1
but even moving the piecemeal bills @entity4 has said he supports will be politically messy , because a majority of his own members are reluctant to sign off on any measure that grants eventual citizenship			1
@entity14 rep. @entity206 of @entity207 , a longtime opponent of any measure granting legal status to undocumented workers in the @entity85 , does n't think an immigration debate does anything but help @entity19			1
" every day that we discuss immigration , that helps @entity28 change the topic from @entity10			0
" the first fight is the debt ceiling			0
election year makes @entity0 even more confusing a big test for @entity4 's ability to assuage conservatives comes soon : @entity3 @entity24 need to decide how they will approach the debate over the debt limit			1
treasury secretary @entity225 said the nation 's borrowing authority will run out at the end of february			0
last fall 's government shutdown was a public display of the fight between conservatives who demanded any spending bill defund @entity10 and establishment @entity24 who worried it was a no - win situation			2
but that episode did have a silver lining for @entity4 , who warned the standoff over @entity10 would backfire			1
it served as a teachable moment for conservatives about the limits of what they can demand in a divided government			2
@entity35 said he wants to address the long - term debt as part of the debt debate , but he 's not sure yet what @entity24 should negotiate in return for supporting another increase in the debt ceiling			0
but he did n't seem to think that debate was the best place to take another stand on @entity10			0
" it has to be something achievable and we ought to start with that			0
it ought to be something we can rally the country around and ultimately sign into law that addresses the problem , " @entity35 said			0
how @entity4 handles the delicate relationship with conservatives will be key to the prospects for his 2014 legislative agenda			1
but the speaker is also the top @entity14 leader in @entity0 of a party still struggling to regroup after losses at the national level in 2012 , so the direction he takes will also have an impact on the political message in this fall 's midterm elections .			0

conservatives fear @entity4 will play " prevent defense " ahead of midterms
they feel that presenting a contrast with @entity19 is a winning strategy
conservatives have used their numbers and influence to stymie @entity4 on policy
