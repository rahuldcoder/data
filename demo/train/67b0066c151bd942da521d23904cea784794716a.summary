-- blame it on @entity2 ? no , let 's not			2
this week 's preferred media narrative comes in two parts : first , that comprehensive immigration reform is n't just headed to the back burner but will be completely off the stove until 2015 and beyond			1
and second , that it was the crisis in @entity9 that pushed the issue off the agenda			1
after all , we 're told , how can @entity13 concentrate on anything else when it has to decide whether to approve a military strike against the regime of @entity9 president @entity17 ? the first part is fact , but the second part is fiction			1
it 's true that @entity13 is done with the immigration debate for the rest of this year			1
the @entity26 - controlled @entity25 might hold a vote on a " reform - lite " bill where illegal immigrants get legal status but not citizenship			1
or it might offer legal status only to farm workers and @entity36 , those publicity - seeking undocumented young people who want preferential treatment because they intend to go to college or join the military			2
but any hope of a large - scale reform that offers legal status to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the @entity45 has faded			1
and because @entity13 really only shows up for work in odd - numbered years ( so members can run for re-election in - between ) , we 'll probably be having this conversation in 2015 , 2017 and 2019			1
it is not true , however , that it was @entity9 that killed immigration reform for this @entity13			1
that 's just a quick and easy explanation -- one favored by those who do n't understand the issue in all its complexities -- and it 's also an excuse that comes in handy for lawmakers looking for an exit door			2
one of them is rep. @entity64 , @entity65 , who recently told @entity67 's @entity66 that it is becoming less likely that immigration reform will pass anytime soon because @entity13 is turning its attention to @entity9			1
weeks ago , @entity64 walked away from immigration reform efforts in the @entity25			1
no , a proper autopsy would show that immigration reform is meeting its demise in this @entity13 for a variety of reasons			1
here are three of them : one : the major legislative offering -- the @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity76 -- collapsed under its own weight			0
when the @entity83 's bipartisan " @entity82 " unveiled its masterpiece in april , the bill was 844 pages long			2
the amendment process pushed it past 1,000 pages			0
the folks who have helped pass immigration reform legislation -- i.e. , the 1986 @entity90 -- before will tell you that when you want to pass legislation , you want the bill to get smaller as time goes on , not the opposite			1
besides , there was too much pork			0
many of the giveways have had nothing to do with immigration but were merely intended to get the support of senator so - and - so from such - and - such state			2
that 's because , as @entity108 - based policy analyst @entity107 maintains , the debate was always about politics instead of what it should have been about : policy			1
@entity107 knows this terrain well , having contributed to the debate over reform in 1986 as executive director of the @entity117			2
many advocates this time around were too busy worrying about passing something , anything , to give a thought to whether what they had on the table was worth passing or how it would be implemented			0
two : as broken as @entity127 is on most issues , when the subject is immigration , it is doubly dysfunctional			0
that town is filled with people who use this issue to further their own agendas			0
if you interviewed illegal immigrants and asked them what they would have liked to have achieved in the immigration reform process -- and i 've done just that -- they would ask for three things : a work permit , the ability to travel across borders and a driver 's license			1
what 's not on that list ? @entity148 and the voting privileges that come with it , which is a repeated deal - breaker for politicians			2
@entity127 is also filled with people who think they know more than the folks on the frontlines			0
if you sat down with @entity158 agents and supervisors and asked them what they need -- and i 've done that , too -- they would ask for new roads on the border , surveillance equipment and tunnel detection capability			0
whatever you do , they 'd say , do n't give us more agents to train and more fencing that does n't keep out anyone			0
so what did the @entity83 bill -- thanks to the @entity178 " border surge " amendment -- offer ? more agents and more fencing			0
three : the debate has been inherently dishonest , with neither side able to trust the other			0
posturing and hot air to the contrary , neither party really wanted to have this debate			0
@entity26 have to referee a civil war between nativists who want less immigration because they fear that the country 's complexion is changing , and business interests that want more immigration because they need workers			2
@entity199 have to keep the peace between @entity201 who want illegal immigrants to have a pathway to citizenship because they feel their pain , and some members of organized labor , who -- despite the fact that their leadership supports reform -- would like to give immigrants a one - way bus ticket to their home country because they fear the competition			1
the solution ? fool everyone			0
@entity26 talk tough but go soft on employers by creating loopholes and delaying enforcement efforts			0
@entity199 talk soft but pander to working - class @entity45 by ratcheting up deportations and building walls			0
still , it is one heck of a tough spot to be in			0
now thanks to the crisis in @entity9 , members of @entity13 in both parties have a way out			1
and , with the enthusiasm of a dying man in the desert reaching for a bottle of water , they 're grabbing it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			2

@entity237 : some say @entity9 kept @entity25 from passing immigration reform . that 's bogus
he says debate over until 2015 ; bill was *cumbersome* and pork - laden
he says sticking points are over things not vital to reform movement , such as citizenship
@entity237 : both parties *panicked* ; @entity9 gives them out , but it 's not the real reason
