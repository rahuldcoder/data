-- politics has long mixed with golf -- from the early 20th century , when @entity3 became the first @entity5 president to openly admit his love for the game , to modern - day leaders such as @entity9 and @entity10			1
one of their colleagues , @entity13 , was the first honorary chairman of the @entity16 event , which will this week be contested by the @entity5 and @entity18 teams for the ninth time			1
@entity21 prime minister @entity20 will be the first woman to fulfill the role as 24 of the world 's best @entity24 golfers line up in @entity26 for a series of match play contests starting on thursday			1
the @entity5 have dominated the biennial tournament since it was first played in 1994 , with six wins and a tie			1
the @entity33 ' only win came when @entity34 also staged the 1998 competition -- and @entity21 pm @entity36 was chairman			1
@entity10 and his father have both served in the role , while in 2000 @entity40 became the first sitting @entity5 president to be involved			1
@entity43 president @entity42 ( 2003 ) and @entity45 prime minister @entity44 ( 2007 ) have also accepted the honor			1
players are not paid , and tournament profits go to charity , with more than $ 23 million distributed to 15 countries since 1994			2
while origins of its name are unclear -- the @entity51 , which runs the event , could not give @entity0 a definitive answer -- the tournament 's link with global leaders is undeniable			1
@entity9 , the 2009 chairman , follows in a long line of @entity61 incumbents to love golf			1
this was never more evident than on may 2 this year -- the date he announced that @entity67 leader @entity66 had been killed by @entity5 forces in @entity69			1
on the morning of his address to the nation , president @entity9 deflected any possible attention away from him by indulging in his favorite pursuit , a game of golf at the @entity76 course in @entity77			1
although , quite understandably , he played only nine holes instead of his regular 18 that day , @entity9 's love for the game meant he had a perfect decoy to the dramatic events about to unfold			1
he is not alone in taking to the greens while occupying the @entity84 , with 15 of the last 18 presidents said to have played the sport while in power			0
here is @entity0 's guide to the top golfing leaders			2
@entity91 ( 1961 - 1963 ) video footage of @entity91 playing golf shows how talented he was , although -- unlike president @entity9 -- he was reluctant to associate himself with the game			1
during his run for president in 1960 , @entity91 did everything possible to keep his fellow @entity5 from discovering that he not only loved the game but was nearly as good as a club professional , with a beautiful natural swing			1
throughout @entity102 's two terms , @entity91 had portrayed him as someone who cared more about lowering his handicap than improving the lives of ordinary @entity5 , so information about his own passion for the game only emerged later			1
@entity102 ( 1953 - 1961 ) @entity102 is recognized as probably the most dedicated to the sport , and was often criticized by @entity110 for spending too much time on the golf course			2
@entity102 's solution ? in 1954 he had a putting green installed at the @entity61 , a short stroll from the @entity84 , to enable him to practice while at work			1
it still exists to this day			0
the former five - star general was also a member at the @entity119 , where an overhanging tree on the 17th hole proved such an obstacle to the leader that it was dubbed the " @entity124			0
@entity3 ( 1909 - 1913 ) @entity3 was the 27th president , but the first to openly admit to his love of golf , which had previously been depicted as a sport for the rich			2
in fact , no president has done more to promote golf than @entity3 , who was a regular player at exhibition matches and encouraged the media to report on how he had played -- good or bad			2
despite being a large man , @entity3 was a good golfer , playing off a 20 - handicap			0
however , during one of his regular public rounds at the @entity138 course in @entity139 , he managed to take a massive 27 shots at the 17th hole			0
@entity142 ( 1913 - 1921 ) like his predecessor @entity3 , @entity142 was mad about golf			2
in fact , it is widely rumored that he played a round every day of the week , apart from sunday			0
during his two terms in office , @entity142 played more than 1,000 rounds			0
he even had a set of black balls made so he could play golf in the snow			1
a man of famous quotes , @entity142 described golf as " a game in which one endeavors to control a ball with implements ill - adapted for the purpose			0
@entity162 ( 1933 - 1945 ) @entity162 , the longest - serving president in @entity5 history , started playing golf as a 12 - year - old			1
such was his early addiction to playing , he cleared a patch of land on the family 's four - acre estate to make room for a nine - hole course			0
sadly , illness prevented @entity162 from playing the game for much of his adult life , but he never lost his passion for golf and always kept a lighter in the shape of a golf ball on his desk in the @entity84			0
one of his legacies was the public works program that led to the construction of more than 300 municipal courses with federal money , making the game more accessible to ordinary @entity5			2
there is a public course in @entity190 named after @entity162 in recognition of this			0
@entity10 ( 2001 - 2009 ) president @entity10 was not shy in letting people know about his interest in golf and was often accompanied by the world 's media during a round			1
on one such occasion , he made one of his infamous gaffes which was reported around the globe after he gave a press briefing from the course			0
questioned on violence in the @entity206 , @entity10 told reporters : " i call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers			0
" he then paused and said : " now watch this drive ! " 7			0
@entity13 ( 1974 - 1977 ) an avid golfer and sportsman in general , @entity214 had an unfortunate reputation of being clumsy and accident prone despite being athletic for his age			0
one such occasion happened during a round of golf when his drive accidentally drifted into a crowd of spectators and struck a woman on the head			2
the clip was repeatedly aired on television and parodied by comedians			0
@entity40 ( 1993 - 2001 ) @entity40 was renowned for an entourage featuring @entity235 agents , a police sniper , a man carrying @entity5 nuclear codes , various aides and someone with a secure telephone so he could speak to world leaders during a typical round			2
@entity40 also had a reputation for awarding himself ( and his playing partners ) free shots , known as mulligans , on the course -- a reputation he claimed was greatly exaggerated			0
@entity249 ( 1969 - 1974 ) @entity249 became an avid golfer during his time as vice-president to " golf nut " @entity102			0
however , as the complexities of office took hold towards the end of his tenure , he devoted less and less time to playing , despite having his own private three - hole course at his home in @entity262			2
@entity263 ( 1981 - 1989 ) @entity263 came into politics late and had already perfected a decent swing by the time he took office			0
however , unlike many presidents before him , he actually played less and less golf during his eight years in the @entity61 , although he did indulge in a regular @entity270 round in @entity262			1
on one occasion in 1983 , @entity263 was playing at @entity119 , the home of the masters , when a gunman took hostages in the pro shop and demanded to speak to the former @entity277 actor .			0

@entity9 had the role in 2009 when tournament took place in @entity262
