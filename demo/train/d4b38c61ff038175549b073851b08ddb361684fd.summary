-- when an elderly nun and two fellow peace activists walked undetected onto one of the nation 's most secure nuclear facilities last year , they wanted to call attention to the dangers of nuclear weapons			1
yet their actions in @entity12 , @entity13 , triggered a very different concern : if three older peaceniks can easily trespass onto the @entity16 -- once considered the " @entity17 " for highly enriched uranium -- just how safe are the nation 's nuclear weapons facilities from terrorists ? nuclear weapons interactive : who has what ? sister @entity25 , 83 ; @entity27 - @entity26 , 57 ; and @entity28 , 63 , will stand trial this week on federal charges of destroying @entity32 government property , depredation against federal property exceeding $ 1,000 , trespassing and injuring national - defense premises			1
the last charge alone carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison			1
the trial began tuesday at federal court in @entity42 , @entity13 , according to @entity43 , @entity0 's affiliate in @entity42			1
in the predawn hours of july 28 , 2012 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity28 walked under the cover of darkness through the woods and up a hillside , approaching a chain - link fence surrounding the @entity12 nuclear facility			1
armed with flashlights and a bolt cutter , they cut their way through the fence , fully expecting to be arrested on the spot			0
instead , they walked nearly a mile , cutting through four fences in all , breaching what was supposed to be the most tightly secured uranium processing and storage facility in the country			2
" when we got to the very high security fence where there 's a lethal force authorized ... i thought , maybe we should turn around , " @entity26 told @entity0 's @entity69			0
hours later , the three activists were finally confronted by a guard after hoisting banners , spray - painting messages and splattering human blood on a building that houses highly enriched uranium			2
since the incident , @entity78 has held a series of hearings and issued security recommendations to the @entity83 and its @entity84 , which runs @entity16 and seven other nuclear weapons sites			1
most recently , deputy energy secretary @entity86 testified before the @entity87 in march that the @entity83 has taken " several major actions ... to improve security " since the y - 12 breach , including management changes and independent security reviews			0
today , changes at @entity16 are noticeable			0
a new security contractor is in charge			0
new signs and security fences are going up			0
while last year 's security breach shed light on systematic weaknesses at @entity16 , a former nuclear reactor safety manager at the @entity102 said he does n't think the nation 's nuclear weapons material were ever at any risk			1
" what these people did was more like trespassing than gaining access to any weapons - grade material , " said @entity107 , who is now a vice provost and dean at @entity109			2
" once they got in , they could spray paint things , but it 's just like if you got into @entity17 , you would n't know the combination to the locks			0
" @entity107 said the country 's nuclear weapons material is spread across eight sites around the country that are " usually out in the middle of nowhere " to protect against threats			1
" there 's really only one place where the weapons are fully assembled ; i 'm not going to tell you which one , " @entity107 said			1
" and the reason there are eight places , they do n't want people to have the full knowledge ( of what the other facilities do )			0
" we almost never see an assembled nuclear weapon			2
" but another nuclear security expert said the y - 12 breach was more than just trespassing by a few environmental protesters			2
" this was a very serious incident because they penetrated the protected area , and that 's when there was supposed to be an immediate security response , " said @entity144 , a senior scientist with @entity145 , a watchdog group that monitors the @entity83 and the @entity146			2
" if they had been trained , the kind of paramilitary group that the @entity83 is supposed to be ensuring they can protect against , with hand - carried explosives , other breaching tools , physical access to the building structure ... the guards would have already lost			0
" @entity144 said the breach was not an isolated incident			0
" it was a result of this reduced central oversight , giving contractors more responsibility for supervising themselves , and that 's an invitation of corner - cutting and complacency to set in , " he said			0
the incident not only broke the public 's trust that the government is " exercising good oversight " of its nuclear weapons facilities , according to @entity144 , but he said it also has " global implications			1
" " if we ca n't even control our own nuclear weapons material , it shows what a major challenge it is around the world ... that have comparably dangerous materials but are even less protected			1
and , @entity144 pointed out , if the @entity32 appears to have vulnerabilities in protecting its nuclear weapons material , " then that not only reduces our authority to criticize other countries , it raising questions about the integrity of our own security			1
" @entity0 's @entity69 and @entity196 contributed to this report			0
