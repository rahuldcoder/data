as @entity1 continues its military occupation of the @entity4 district of @entity5 , as @entity6 enunciates a doctrine of military intervention in support of ethnic brethren , and the @entity11 ponders what might be done , @entity0 begin to think again about the 1930s and the origins of @entity15 the @entity1 historian @entity17 , for example , has published a sophisticated comparison between @entity6 's seizure of @entity4 and @entity21 's annexation of @entity22 , seeing both as the beginning of a chain of events with fatal consequences not just for the subjects of the aggression but for the aggressors themselves			1
in @entity30 , where i live , one also hears constant mentions of 1938			0
@entity22 and other citizens of @entity34 countries are beginning to consider what the end of @entity5 might mean for their own @entity0 system			1
the point is not that @entity6 is like @entity21 ; the point is that the removal of a state from @entity0 has consequences for the continent			1
when we consider any state in isolation from the system , it can seem fragile , new , perhaps unnecessary			0
@entity5 today , like @entity22 in the 1930s , is a creation of a dramatic change in the world order			1
@entity22 as an independent republic owed its existence to @entity55 , just as @entity5 as an independent republic owes its existence to the unexpected collapse of the @entity59			1
@entity60 lasted for two decades ; independent @entity5 has existed for only slightly longer			2
for some , an artificial creation that had no right to exist ; for others home to a people indistinguishable from @entity66 , @entity22 had few friends in 1938			1
@entity5 finds itself in much the same position today			1
just as most @entity0 leaders were happy to accept the @entity66 idea that @entity22 had no right to exist , many people around the @entity11 seem ready to forget about @entity5 or to believe the @entity74 's propaganda that half of the country is @entity1			1
@entity5 towns : apricot trees and vanished graves yet the reasons why states are supposed to exist are general , transcending their particular histories			2
the principles of international law are not subject to particular claims about identities			0
as with @entity6 today in @entity5 , @entity21 in 1938 in @entity22 based his claim on the need to protect fellow ethnics			1
it is easy to criticize @entity6 's arguments in some important details			2
he claims to be defending @entity1 citizens			0
but since dual citizenship in @entity5 is illegal , the most visible of @entity1 citizens in @entity5 are ( 1 ) the @entity1 soldiers and sailors based in @entity104 , ( 2 ) the @entity1 soldiers who have just invaded southern @entity5 and ( 3 ) @entity5 riot police who are being given @entity1 citizenship at the @entity1 consulate in @entity100 to reward them for beating @entity5 protesters			1
@entity6 claims to be defending " compatriots , " but that is a category that has no meaning			2
the suggestion is that anyone who speaks @entity1 needs a @entity1 invasion ; that would mean that since i am writing in @entity112 i need an @entity112 invasion			0
but the real problem goes much deeper			0
in both cases the claim of a right of protection of ethnic brethren was only one element of a larger worldview			0
@entity21 in fact cared little for ethnic @entity66 in @entity22 or for @entity22 itself			1
its destruction of @entity22 was meant to show , as it did , that all standards of the @entity0 system were subject to corruption if a single man took a single risk			1
what @entity0 decide to see in the @entity5 revolution might in the end define @entity0			1
the interwar @entity0 system was based on the principle of state sovereignty			2
no doubt this was an imperfect and incomplete moral and legal basis for international relations			0
and yet its violation meant the end of the system itself			0
when @entity0 's leaders abandoned @entity22 in 1938 , they were conceding to @entity21 the right to define the new rules of the new order			1
the immediate consequences were clear enough			0
without the protection of a state , @entity22 's @entity149 minority was subject to anti-semitic violence			2
once @entity22 had been abandoned , @entity0 leaders had little trouble betraying a country that truly deserved their support , democratic @entity157			1
its dismemberment began later that same year			0
once @entity0 had the experience of allowing states to die they could do so again			2
by the time the great powers came to their senses in 1939 it was too late			0
the @entity0 system of today is based on the principle of state sovereignty , combined with the robust international cooperation of the @entity34 , and legitimated by a historically new attention to human rights			1
the @entity34 is based on the premise of learning from history			2
@entity172 and @entity173 are seen as experiences from which @entity0 have learned and extremes to which @entity0 politics must be restrained			2
this system , like the interwar system , is vulnerable to challenge			0
@entity1 has now proposed an alternative , in which @entity1 culture is historically unique and demanding of protection , @entity0 fascism and @entity173 are a trove of constructive ideas , and human rights are nothing more than a facade for western imperialism			0
@entity1 propaganda assigns a particular importance to sexual minorities , with many prominent commentators claiming for example that many in the @entity34 are part of an international gay conspiracy			0
the @entity1 invasion of southern @entity5 is a threat above all to the citizens of @entity5			0
as professor @entity17 has argued , it has threatening implications also for @entity1			0
this was a courageous argument for him to make -- he says he was immediately fired from his position			0
@entity0 who face fewer risks can continue the argument			0
the seizure of @entity4 was meant as a challenge to the @entity34			1
it is meant to prove that @entity0 values can not defend themselves			1

@entity5 crisis is making @entity0 think again about ' 30s and origins of @entity15 , says @entity215
@entity215 : as with @entity6 today in @entity5 , @entity21 in 1938 in @entity22 based claim on need to protect fellow ethnics
once @entity22 had gone , @entity0 leaders easily betrayed @entity157 , which truly deserved support , he adds
seizure of @entity4 was meant as challenge to @entity34 , to prove @entity0 values can not defend themselves - @entity215
