-- many science fiction fans take for granted that there 's no sound in the vastness of space			0
but @entity6 , a physics and astronomy professor at @entity8 , says dramatic events in space do make a kind of music			1
" there 's no air in space to compress to ring against your ear , " she told @entity0 in an interview at the @entity14 conference in @entity15 , @entity16 , in march			0
" but it 's important to realize the universe is n't a silent film , because space itself wobbles and rumbles like a drum in response to all of these things unfolding in the cosmos			0
" " if space itself is ringing and squeezing and stretching , your eardrums can resonate in response ... you could hear the sound of very dramatic events in the universe , " @entity31 said			2
in a talk at @entity14 , @entity31 illustrated her point by conjuring up an example of two black holes spinning around each other and coalescing			1
" black holes can bang on space time like mallets on a drum , " she said			1
watch @entity6 's @entity14 she added in the interview , " we can design experiments that can pick up the ringing of space ... you can plug that into the stereo system and pick up the sound			2
" there are tens of thousands of black holes , which can be formed by massive dying stars , in our galaxy , @entity31 said			1
listening to their music might prove hazardous			0
your ear could hear but , as @entity31 added , " now of course , your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully , so you might have trouble understanding what 's going on			0

@entity6 : *conventional* sound ca n't exist in *vaccuum* of space
she says cosmic events do come with a kind of music
black holes can squeeze and stretch space time , she says
@entity31 : your ear could *detect* the sound , but at great cost to your health
