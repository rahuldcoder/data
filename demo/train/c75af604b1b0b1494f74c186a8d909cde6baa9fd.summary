-- a day after @entity5 lawmakers approved a request from president @entity7 to send military forces across their southern border into @entity10 and ordered forces there to hand over their weapons , leaders in capitals across the @entity3 were sharpening their pencils in hopes that the language of diplomacy could dull the tensions and restore the status quo			1
@entity10 some of the most impassioned speech came from @entity10 's acting prime minister @entity20			0
" this is a red alert			0
this is not a threat			0
this is actually a declaration of war to my country , " he told @entity25			1
" and we urge president @entity7 to pull back his military and stick to the international obligations and bilateral and multilateral agreements that were signed between @entity10 and @entity5			1
" if president @entity7 wants to be the president who started the war between two neighboring and friendly countries , between @entity10 and @entity5 , so he has reached this target within inches			1
we are on the brink of the disaster			0
there is no reason for the @entity5 to invade @entity10			1
and we believe that our @entity45 partners and the entire global community will support the territorial integrity and unity of @entity10 and will do everything we can to stop the military conflict provoked by the @entity5 in @entity51			1
" support he got -- as statements from world leaders quickly clogged reporters ' inboxes			0
but they offered few specifics about how they might twist @entity7 's arm if he did not heed their warnings			1
@entity10 mobilizes troops after @entity5 's ' declaration of war ' @entity64 " we have to recognize the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of @entity10 has been violated and this can not be the way to conduct international affairs , " said @entity65 , @entity64 's foreign secretary , before boarding a plane sunday from @entity67 to the @entity10 capital , @entity69			1
@entity65 said @entity64 will join other countries in pulling out of preparatory talks for the next @entity78 of industrialized nations , which is to be held in @entity80 , @entity5 , in june , " and then we will keep our approach to further @entity78 meetings under review			1
" future decisions " will depend on what happens over the coming days			0
" he predicted that @entity5 will see " the very strong concerns around the world by many , many nations " and called on both sides to avoid conflict			1
@entity65 expressed confidence that the international response could have an impact			1
" it will be a very united diplomatic response -- and not just from the western world but , i think , from many other countries in the world , and that is something that @entity5 will have to think hard about , " he said			1
@entity102 in a statement on saturday , @entity102 's prime minister @entity103 condemned the military intervention as " a clear violation of @entity10 's sovereignty and territorial integrity " and in violation of @entity5 's obligations under international law			1
in addition to suspending its engagement in preparations for the @entity78 , @entity102 recalled its ambassador from @entity116 for consultations			0
@entity102 supports the deployment to @entity10 of international monitors from the @entity120 and the @entity121 , @entity103 said			0
" should president @entity7 continue on this course of action , it will lead to ongoing negative consequences for our bilateral relationship			1
" but again , few specifics			0
a strange scene , and somewhat polite standoff in @entity132 the @entity133 during his sunday address to thousands of worshippers in @entity137 , @entity134 chose not to judge , saying only that he hoped for dialogue and understanding in lieu of other options			0
" i hope that all of the country 's parties will endeavor to overcome misunderstandings and to build together the future of the nation			0
i make a concerned appeal to the international community to support any initiative in favor of dialogue and understanding			0
" @entity154 a two - hour flight north of @entity156 , in @entity157 , @entity154 did not hesitate to lay the blame at the feet of the @entity5			1
" we condemn @entity5 's military escalation in @entity132 , " secretary general @entity160 told reporters , reading from a @entity154 statement			2
" military action against @entity10 by forces of the @entity5 is a breach of international law , it contravenes the principles of the @entity171 and the @entity172			2
" @entity5 must respect its obligations under the @entity120 charter and the spirit and principles of the @entity121 , on which peace and stability in @entity51 rests			2
" he called on @entity5 to withdraw its forces to its bases and urged both parties to seek a resolution through dialogue , " through the dispatch of international observers " under the auspices of the @entity188 or the @entity121			2
he did not elaborate on what the consequences might be if @entity5 does not comply			2
@entity191 @entity191 foreign minister @entity192 said the world was on " a dangerous path , " but that " a new division of @entity51 can still be prevented			0
" in a statement , he called on all those responsible to " desist to take further steps that can only be understood as a provocation			0
anything else would lead to an escalation of uncertain , possibly dramatic consequences and could make many years of constructive cooperation for a more secure @entity51 naught			0
" @entity5 has no right to use its military beyond the rules of the lease on the @entity5 @entity209 on @entity10 territory			2
" then , in a nod to @entity7 's assertion that his forces were trying to protect @entity5 in @entity10 , he added , " we are committed to ensuring that the new political leadership in @entity69 protects the rights and interests of all @entity10			1
this includes in particular an unequivocal protection of the rights of minorities , including the use of languages			0
" @entity225 a spokeswoman for @entity225 president @entity227 said @entity228 too had suspended its participation in preparatory talks for the @entity78			0
@entity227 spoke with @entity7 and " asked him to avoid any use of force and to seek a solution to the crisis with the international community			2
" @entity5 @entity116 's take on the conversation differed			2
" at the request of @entity227 , @entity7 shared his assessment of the situation in @entity10 , stressing that there exists a real threat to the lives of @entity5 citizens and our compatriots , " the @entity240 website said			1
" the two presidents exchanged views on possible ways of resolving the situation in @entity10 and agreed to continue contacts			0
" opinion : how @entity7 carries out power grab			2

" this is actually a declaration of war , " acting @entity257 says
few specifics about what might happen if @entity7 fails to *accede* to @entity45 wishes
" that is something that @entity5 will have to think hard about , " says @entity65
