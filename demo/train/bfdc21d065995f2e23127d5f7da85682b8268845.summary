-- love that chocolate @entity2 ice - cream ? but what about the way its makers treat their farmers ? how about @entity8 and the way its production impacts the environment ? in a campaign to push big companies towards more ethical sourcing , international development group @entity12 is asking people to think about food producers ' attitudes towards issues such as climate change and workers ' rights the next time they dig into their favorite treat			1
@entity12 's " behind the @entity29 " scorecard compares the way the 10 largest global food and drink companies do business			1
the report , first compiled last year , looks at transparency , women 's rights , farmers ' rights and land , water and climate sustainability			1
it relies on a " naming and shaming " strategy which asks people to share their concerns about the industry on social networks			0
according to @entity12 , users asked companies to change their practices nearly 400,000 times since the campaign was first launched last february -- making their requests by sharing information on social media or printing out an information poster			2
a year after its launch , the campaign is now looking at how these companies have improved their business practices			0
of the 10 biggest food and drink companies , nine made improvements to their policies in the last 12 months and improved their scores , @entity12 says			1
@entity62 , the seller of @entity2 and @entity63 , was the only one to see their score drop			0
@entity12 's assessment is not favorable			2
" @entity62 does n't recognize key issues like the right to earn a living wage , " the report said about the company that sells @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity2 or @entity70			2
@entity62 , like other low - performing companies , blames @entity12 's methodology for its poor scores			1
" we do feel our efforts merit a stronger score , " the company 's spokesperson said			0
" @entity62 is strongly focused on sustainability , " a spokesperson for the company said in a statement to @entity0			0
" we regularly report our progress in our annual @entity86			0
our report tends not to mirror the @entity12 scorecard , and because the scorecard is based only on publicly available information , that may be a key factor in their ranking , " the statement said			2
@entity93 , the brand behind @entity95 cereals and global tea business @entity96 , improved its score slightly compared to last year when it finished last -- but in this year 's report , @entity12 still highlights its lack of ethical sourcing policies			1
" in reality , the group 's policies are much , much more effective than @entity12 gives it credit for , " a spokesperson for @entity93 , which finished second to last , told @entity0			1
" at @entity93 , we believe we have policies and practices in place to deliver a genuinely effective corporate responsibility strategy , " @entity93 said in a statement			0
at the other end of the spectrum are the companies @entity12 praises for their drive to change their sourcing attitudes			0
" @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 have joined a race to the top on policies that help address issues like hunger , poverty , women 's rights , land grabs and climate change in their supply chains , " the report said			1
@entity118 scored the highest marks on the issues of climate change and water usage , while @entity120 came top of the table at supporting women 's rights			1
@entity119 , the owner of @entity140 's and @entity141 got thumbs up from @entity12 for their support of small - scale farmers			1
but @entity12 says even the top - ranking companies still have a long way to go			2
" it will take time for them to reverse a 100 - year history of relying on cheap land and labor to make mass products at huge profits but at high social and environmental costs			0
the race to the top is under way and there are clear leaders and laggards , " @entity155 added			0
