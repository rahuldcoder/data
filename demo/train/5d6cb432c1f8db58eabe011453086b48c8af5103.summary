-- as the mug shots of the alleged killers of @entity5 star @entity4 were shown on television , i kept wondering when we were going to see their parents step forward			1
i saw a couple of mothers , but their dads were missing in action			2
@entity14 credits two strong parents with raising him to do right by them			1
dads matter , and it 's ridiculous for us to act as if all it takes is a loving mom			2
now , i do n't know what it means not to have a father in your life			2
i 'm not familiar with a mom being strung out on a crack binge			2
and when my parents were called to the school when there was a discipline problem , @entity28 and @entity29 did n't go off on the teacher or principal			1
in fact , i can still feel the pain of my elementary school principal 's paddle being applied to my butt when i acted a fool			1
the principal could only pop me three times			0
@entity29 ? he had no limit			0
bottom line : i can sit here today and celebrate them and enjoy a wonderful life because my parents were hell - bent on raising their children to do right by them , especially my dad			1
we can spend all day talking about the ills afflicting urban @entity52 -- and there are plenty that are institutional -- but the decaying value of life in inner cities clearly can be traced to the exodus of fathers from the lives of so many young men			1
excuses often are tossed about as to why black men leave their children ( and their children 's moms ) to fend for themselves			1
but a lot of them are just sorry and refuse to accept the responsibility that comes with raising a child			0
a lot of my colleagues will suggest it 's too simplistic to assign such a high value to a dad being in the life of a child			0
but just take a visit to your local jail , juvenile hall or state prison			0
you likely will be confronted with a sea of black men -- strong , able - bodied , creative and restless -- who have spent or will spend years and years with a prison number identifying who they are			1
according to the @entity91 , of all the black men in the @entity52 between the ages of 25 and 29 in 2002 , 10.4 percent were incarcerated			1
@entity93 and white men ? just 2.4 percent and 1.2 percent respectively			1
if a poll were done on how many grew up without fathers , i can guarantee you the numbers would be staggering			1
the rampant poverty that exists has led many young blacks to a life of crime , choosing to sell drugs and involve themselves in gangs as opposed to focusing on education as a way out of the cellar of life			0
but you see , when nearly 70 percent of black kids are born to unmarried parents , likely to a too - young mom , that puts tremendous pressure on grandmothers ( and some grandfathers ) , sisters and brothers to take up the slack			1
but if the person who impregnated that woman were on the scene , not only helping to pay for the raising of the child but also serving as a strong influence , i just do n't believe we would see such a chronic condition			1
and the black men who have done their job are scared to death about what the tendency for black men to leave relationships means for their daughters			1
the day before leaving for vacation , i got word that a good friend , @entity139 attorney @entity138 , had died of pancreatic cancer			0
in our last extensive conversation before he was diagnosed in july , @entity138 pleaded with me to use my national media stage to be a voice to sound the alarm about what 's happening to black men in @entity52 , because he wanted to know that his daughter would have a respectable man to marry one day			1
( i 'm sure if she chose to marry someone who 's not black , @entity138 would n't mind , but he realized that as a nation , we mostly marry within our race			1
) i promised @entity138 that i would do all i can , because this has been an issue for me for many years			0
in fact , my mom gets angry because i 'm always talking about my dad on television , radio and in my books			0
that 's because when you see black men who have " made it , " the accolades are plenty for their moms , and their dads are hardly mentioned			1
i just think it 's critical to show daddy some love , too			0
this is not an issue that black @entity52 can continue to sweep under the rug			2
i 've heard countless folks talk about it , such as @entity177 presidential candidate sen. @entity176 , who noted that his dad left his family when he was a toddler and did n't see much of him growing up			0
even in the @entity181 @entity0 - @entity183 debate , @entity181 candidate @entity180 said fathers are part of the answer to addressing crime in inner cities			2
we should n't shame our young girls who get pregnant , but surely it should n't be seen as a blue - ribbon day			0
teenage black girls and black boys should be focused on picking colleges , not the names of babies			2
when a young girl wants a baby christened , her pastor should be asking to meet with the father as well , even if the two do n't get along			0
we also should be telling black women not to lie down with any fool			1
a moment of pleasure could lead you to a lifetime of raising that child			0
a friend of mine suggested more black men need to mentor young black men			2
but that 's a bandage			0
if we get black men to handle their business in the first place , no one else would have to stand in the gap			2
unless black @entity52 owns up to this problem -- and fast -- we are going to see another generation of young black men who are angry with their lot in life			2
and the result will be more discipline problems in school , which will lead to folks dropping out , and that is nothing but a one - way ticket to jail			0
black men , it 's time to man up			2
enough with the sperm donors			0
we need real men to stand up and accept their responsibility			0
the state of our boys is on us			0
