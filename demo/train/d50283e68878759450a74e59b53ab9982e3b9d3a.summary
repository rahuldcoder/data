the @entity1 administration on wednesday declassified opinions from a secret court that oversees government surveillance showing the @entity5 was broadly collecting domestic internet communications of @entity7 and misrepresenting the scope of that effort to the court			1
the three opinions include one from october 2011 by @entity7 district judge @entity12 , who scolded government lawyers that the @entity5 had , for the third time in less than three years , belatedly acknowledged it was collecting more data than it was legally allowed to			1
" @entity5 acquires valuable information through its upstream collection , but not without substantial intrusions on @entity20 protected interests , " @entity12 wrote			2
the focus of the opinion was the government 's admission that for three years , under its authority to monitor foreign communications , it had been collecting information beyond what it gets from @entity30 service providers , and included data that was entirely domestic			2
the @entity32 estimated the mistaken collection of domestic data , including e-mails and other internet activity of @entity7 , totaled 58,000 communications a year			0
report : @entity5 can see 75 % of @entity7 web messages the @entity5 said the collection was a mistake that went beyond its authority under @entity43 of the @entity44			2
" this was a situation where there was technological problem that could not be avoided , rather than any overreach " by the @entity5 , according to a senior intelligence official who spoke with reporters about the matter			1
the other @entity32 opinions from november 2011 and september 2012 covered @entity5 steps to fix errors it made in over-collecting data and to purge data it should n't have collected			1
those rulings indicated that the matter had been resolved			0
the overall issue , the intelligence official said , was immediately raised with the court			1
" the @entity32 court probed deeply and thoroughly into the issue			0
the government took strong appropriate steps to remedy the problem , and the court determined it had remedied and that the collection could continue , " according to the official who did not speak for attribution			1
" this is not an egregious overreaching by a greedy agency seeking to spy on @entity7 , " the official added			0
@entity5 admits ' mistakes ' amid criticism after audit show is broke privacy rules the administration also released documents provided to @entity81 to persuade lawmakers to reauthorize its surveillance authorities			1
the agency has come under pressure from lawmakers of both parties over the sweeping nature of its secret data collection , most recently surveillance that captures telephone metadata related to communications to and from the @entity7			1
that program and the one addressed in the document release on wednesday were brought to public light through leaks to media outlets by former @entity5 contractor @entity99 , who fled the @entity7 and is now in @entity101 under temporary asylum			1
their exposure also has generated concern from privacy groups and libertarians			0
@entity111 chairman @entity110 , who has proposed legislation aimed at reforming certain provisions of the @entity44 related to the @entity32 , welcomed the newest development			0
" today 's release of documents by the director of national intelligence begins to appropriately draw back the curtain on the secret law of government surveillance , and they also underscore the need for increased oversight and stronger protections for @entity7 ' privacy , " he said in a statement			2
@entity110 is planning a hearing in coming weeks on the document release			0
in 2008 , the @entity5 began collecting what it called " upstream " communications , essentially information that travels across the @entity30 , separate from the what it receives from internet service providers that filter data to respond to agency requests			1
the @entity5 is supposed to be targeting foreign communications , such as e-mail addresses it believes relate to foreign intelligence , that have to do with potential terrorism investigations			2
the @entity5 said it made mistakes because of the way data was collected			0
it could n't separate information that was entirely domestic			0
government lawyers won approval from the court after making changes and later deleted years of data because some of it could n't be separated from domestic communications			0
