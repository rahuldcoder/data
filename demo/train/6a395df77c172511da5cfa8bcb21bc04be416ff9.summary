@entity0 did his research -- his mother made sure of that			1
she did n't want her 18 - year - old son heading to the @entity6 jungle at all -- let alone , without learning everything he could about the supposed " medicine " with the bizarre name that he insisted would help him turn his young life around			1
" i really tried to discourage him ... i kept telling him over and over , there are no easy answers in life , " @entity12 said			2
but she knew she could n't stop him			0
overshadowed by his " overachieving " triplet brother and sister , @entity18 said @entity0 " was going through this teenage crisis , not knowing what he wanted to do with his life			1
" he had dropped out of junior college and was living with his mother , when he somehow discovered ayahuasca , ( pronounced " eye - uh - @entity32 - kuh " ) a psychedelic brew that some believe can help users achieve a higher state of consciousness			1
" he went online and started reading all these positive things about ayahuasca , which is something i had never heard of before , " @entity18 said			2
" apparently there 's a huge , positive movement toward ayahuasca			1
and he thought that that would help him maybe discover who he was			0
" his research led him to the @entity44 in a remote corner of the @entity47 @entity6 region			1
@entity18 said the center 's website made its ayahuasca experience " sound very individualized			1
" it was n't cheap : @entity0 paid more than $ 2,000 in cash to take part in the ritual			1
despite the promises of the center 's website , a very different experience awaited @entity0 in @entity47			1
a death , then a cover - up @entity0 arrived in @entity47 in august 2012 , a rare overseas excursion for a young man who was more of a homebody than a world traveler			1
he journeyed deep into @entity47 's @entity6 with hopes of experiencing a spiritual transformation			1
on the third night of @entity0 's ayahuasca session , he never returned from his hut			1
days later , when he did n't arrive home , @entity18 called the @entity44 and spoke to an interpreter for @entity70 , who led the center 's ayahuasca sessions			1
" he told me , ' oh well ( @entity0 ) just decided he wanted to leave , he took off down the road , and he 's left , ' " @entity18 said			1
" and i said , ' i do n't believe you			0
my son would never ever do that			2
' " so she and her daughter flew down to @entity47 to help local police search for @entity0			1
for three to four days , they searched hospitals and bars and talked to taxi drivers , asking if anyone had seen @entity0			2
" no one ever saw him , " @entity18 said			0
so @entity18 and her daughter returned home to northern @entity88 while the @entity47 police continued their investigation			2
about a week later , @entity18 said she learned from her contact with the @entity44 center that the shaman admitted to police that he had lied about @entity0 leaving the center			2
they had " found him dead outside , under a bush , " @entity18 said			0
they " panicked and covered him up , and told everyone that he was n't feeling well , that he was in his cabin			0
" the shaman told authorities that he and two other men had buried @entity0 's body , according to @entity18 and @entity47 newspaper @entity106			1
" they said they put him in a wheelbarrow , took him about a mile down the road , dug a pit , buried him , and burned all his belongings , " @entity18 said			0
she returned to @entity47 where she had to identify her son 's body			1
an autopsy in @entity47 was inconclusive			0
the shaman , whose real name is @entity119 , and the two other men were arrested			0
@entity119 was eventually convicted of homicide and lying to authorities , and sentenced to five years in prison , according to local @entity47 media			0
@entity0 's body was eventually brought back to @entity88 where @entity18 said another autopsy also came up inconclusive , and he was cremated			1
according to @entity106 , the shaman told police that @entity0 took too much ayahuasca			1
there 's no conclusive evidence of what killed @entity0 , @entity18 said			1
" the only thing there is possibly out there is maybe the toxicology ( results ) , but i ca n't get that unless i go back to @entity47			0
" an unregulated drug it 's still unclear how ayahuasca can kill someone			2
very little is known about ayahuasca and its effects and many shamanic centers , including the @entity44 , require participants to cleanse their bodies for several months before taking ayahuasca -- a regiment that @entity18 said her son followed very closely			2
ethnobotanical organizations are trying to raise money to study ayahuasca and its medicinal qualities , as well as create a health guide for tourists interested in traveling to shamanic centers in the @entity6			1
there 's a growing concern that as more @entity159 tourists head to the @entity6 looking for a psychedelic experience , more fly - by - night " shamans " will pop up looking to cash in on the boom			1
there have been other reported deaths , as well as reports of physical and sexual assaults			0
six things to know about ayahuasca @entity18 admits she still struggles with grief and agreed to talk to @entity171 about her son 's death because she hopes it might help warn young people like her son who are seeking ayahuasca treatment in the @entity6			1
" if you 're going to do this , you really really really need to research it and make sure wherever you find is properly supervised and there 's medical supervision there , " she said			2
" and maybe even staying in the @entity183 if you need to do it			0
" she remains suspicious about the whole ayahuasca tourism boom , saying " i just think it 's become a fad , maybe it 's like the lsd of the ' 60s			2
" but she said she would support some sort of regulation of the ayahuasca tourism industry if it ensured that participants would be monitored by medical professionals			2
" i definitely think it needs to be monitored somehow			0
it 's a hallucinogenic drug			2
... they call it a medicine , but it is a hallucinogenic drug , " she said			0
" obviously there 's side effects to everything			0
anyone can have an adverse reaction to something			0
you do n't leave someone alone with a hallucinogenic drug ( in their system )			0
" @entity18 says she 'll probably return to @entity47 one day when she 's ready			0
she is not considering any further legal action because , as she said , " i ca n't put myself in that position to continue hating someone			0
" " i just have to try to get this behind me			0
i ca n't continue to hate the shaman			0
... i ca n't let him ruin my life any more than he already has , " she said			0
" i need to get beyond it			0

@entity0 , 18 , traveled to the @entity6 seeking ayahuasca , but never returned
