-- the country that once put the @entity2 in serious jeopardy could become the first from @entity5 to host the event			1
on monday , the @entity5 city of @entity8 joined @entity9 in @entity10 as the only bidders for the @entity12			1
having never staged an @entity14 , the bid has been described as a hugely significant moment for @entity5			0
" we 've done exhaustive background work and are now of the opinion the country is ready for a major multi-code sports event , " said @entity16 , president of the @entity17 and @entity18 ( @entity19 )			0
" we are proud to announce our intention to bid for the @entity26			0
it 's a huge step forward in our history - and that of the @entity5 continent			2
" it is also a distant cry from 1986 when the @entity2 took place in the @entity35 capital @entity36			0
now known as the ' @entity37 ' , over half the 59 @entity2 nations refused to compete in protest at the attitude of the government of @entity42 to sporting links with @entity5 , which was then under apartheid rule			1
the 32 nations that stayed away mainly came from @entity5 , @entity46 and the @entity47 , and they put the @entity2 under intense financial strain			1
should @entity8 win the right to stage the @entity12 , it would raise the question of when @entity5 might finally host an @entity14			1
when @entity54 's @entity53 stages the @entity14 in two years ' time , @entity5 will be the only continent not to have hosted the world 's most important multi-sports event			2
@entity57 unsuccessfully bid for the @entity58 while @entity19 had strongly considered bidding for the 2024 event before deciding against it			0
" the ambition is to consider ( the ) 2024 ( @entity14 ) , " a @entity19 spokesperson said in 2011 , a year after @entity5 hosted the first football @entity65 on @entity5 soil			2
but @entity16 believes the time is right for @entity5 to finally stage the @entity2 , following the disappointment of @entity70 capital @entity69 to win the @entity71			1
the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) vice-president says @entity5 's previous ability to stage major sporting events will hold it in good stead			1
" these are exciting times for @entity5 sport , " said @entity16			2
" over the years we have shown our ability to stage the biggest sporting events , with @entity82 and @entity83 being an example , plus of course the @entity84			0
" monday was the deadline for nations to hand over official notes of interest for staging the 2022 event , and their late arrival may have caused some concern for @entity2 officials			1
last month , @entity95 , the @entity72 chief executive , said the @entity2 could end in 2018 , when @entity96 will host , should no bidder for the @entity12 come forward			0
concerns have been growing about the cost of staging the event , with organizers saying that a possible way of avoiding this would be to reduce the number of different disciplines from 17 to 10			0
however , monday 's bids have given the @entity72 a significant boost			0
" this is an exciting development for the @entity2 movement , one that reinforces the @entity2 ' position on the world 's sporting stage , " said @entity72 president prince @entity108			0
" the future outlook for the @entity2 is extremely positive			0
" @entity9 , which last hosted in 1978 , will be @entity5 's rival when the awarding decision takes place in september 2015			1
" hosting the games in 2022 will demonstrate to the world how much @entity9 has evolved , " said mayor @entity120 in a statement			1
@entity10 was the first country to stage the @entity2 , when @entity124 hosted in 1930 , and has held it on three more occasions since			1
both @entity9 and @entity8 need to hand over confirmed bids in march 2015			2
the next @entity2 will take place in the @entity35 city @entity129 in july .			0

@entity9 and @entity8 declare official interest in hosting 2022 @entity2
monday had been last day for bidders to come forward
@entity10 has hosted four previous times , while @entity5 has yet to stage the games
