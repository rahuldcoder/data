@entity0 -- @entity3 teenager @entity2 lived in fear for years until the young stalker who tormented and threatened her was finally convicted			1
@entity2 was on hand at the @entity8 on tuesday to tell her painful story as attorney general @entity10 and other top officials headlined an event designed to call attention to the growing problem of stalking			1
@entity2 is now a 17 - year - old junior at @entity16 near @entity17			2
she says the stalking started when she was in elementary school and continued for so many years she believed living a life in constant fear was normal			1
then , a few years ago , she decided to openly declare her fears and take up a public fight against stalking			2
with the help of her mother , who taught school , a determined policeman and a caring social worker , @entity2 's case opened the eyes of students and adults alike and led to a tough new anti-stalking law in @entity3			1
" they just could n't believe that i was afraid every day , every night , every moment of my life , " @entity2 told the audience in the ornate @entity36 of the @entity8			1
" that 's been happening to me since i was in fifth grade , so that was pretty normal to me , you know ? " the tormenter in @entity2 's case was a girl from the neighborhood who at first hung out for hours and days outside @entity2 's house			2
but after the intimidation escalated to verbal threats to kill @entity2 , the courts finally intervened			2
the offender pleaded guilty and was ordered to stay away			0
because the case was adjudicated in juvenile court , many of the specifics remain under seal , and @entity3 officials and @entity2 's family and supporters wo n't talk about many details			1
attorney general @entity10 paid tribute to @entity2 for " the courage to come forward and share her heartbreaking story with the world			2
" @entity10 said @entity2 and her family had " provided a model for how a potential tragedy can be turned into an opportunity " to pass a law strengthening protection of stalking victims			1
there are millions of victims , and many of them are n't even certain they are being stalked , officials said			1
@entity79 , director of the @entity80 , says much of the abuse and torment has moved online			0
she says virtually every technology program and social networking site is being abused and users are being harassed or stalked			0
in extreme cases , victims are killed			0
in most cases , they are scared or intimidated			0
the government defines stalking as a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear			0
the latest @entity8 statistics are nearly five years old , but they show about 3.4 million people age 18 or older were victims of stalking in 2006			1
@entity79 says the number is surely much higher now			0
there are no available figures on juvenile stalking victims			0
officials urge individuals to report repeated unwanted phone calls , letters or e-mails			0
they also want authorities called if there are repeated incidents in which offenders leave flowers or gifts , show up at places waiting for the potential victim , or spread rumors about that person on the internet			0
authorities stressed the individual acts may not be criminal , but collectively if they cause real fear they can violate the law , and courts can order protections for victims of any age			0
victims come in all demographic groups , but officials say at least three of every four stalking victims are women .			1
