-- a voice heard on an amazing video of 300 feeding alligators says it all			1
" i ai n't never seen so many gators in my life			0
" @entity9 's biggest catch earlier this month , when he went fishing at @entity11 in the @entity12 in southeast @entity13 , was two videos that have made a splash on @entity16 and @entity17			1
as of tuesday night they had garnered nearly 100,000 page views , according to @entity17			0
one of the videos looks like something out of an " @entity23 " special			0
alligator heads bob on the surface while others , in the background , gyrate and thrash in the water as they snap at mudfish , also known as bowfin			1
the alligators are jammed in a canal perhaps 30 feet wide			2
" with a high population of mudfish you can almost smell them , " said @entity33 , supervisory refuge manager at the @entity34			1
" i 've never seen footage like that before , " said state wildlife biologist @entity39 who , along with other wildlife officials , told @entity0 this rare " cooperative feeding " happens once every three or four years			2
@entity46 park manager @entity45 believes it last happened in 2007			0
@entity45 , who was not at the park the weekend of the event , said rangers saw alligators congregating about 10 p.m. july 9 near the quarter - mile - long canal that leads from the @entity46 boat area into open water near @entity55			2
no one had any idea of the scene that would greet @entity9 , 39 , of @entity59 , @entity13 , on the morning of july 10			1
" when i put the boat in you had the awfulest ruckus , " @entity9 said			1
many alligators were in the boat basin			2
he headed out in the early morning light with another boat close behind			0
moments later , they realized they had about 150 alligators in front of them and 150 behind			2
@entity9 said the teeming alligators were hunting together			1
many formed a reptile wall beyond the canal			0
" they would converge together , " @entity9 said			1
" i saw gators pushing them [ the fish ] back [ into the canal ]			2
i saw them push them to the bank and eat them			0
" @entity9 returned to the park the next morning , july 11 , and shot more video			1
he said about 175 gators were visible			0
the alligators were gone by 8 a.m. , according to @entity45			2
although he and other wildlife officials said the waters are safe for boaters , the state park waited to be sure that wild morning			0
" i would n't rent my boats out until they were gone , " he said			0
it is a small portion of the @entity34 's 401,000 - plus acres			1
@entity33 estimates the refuge is home to about 11,000 alligators			0
he said he was concerned that @entity9 and the other boater may have been pushing the gators along and might have hurt them			1
" this was potentially not a safe thing to do			0
" but @entity9 said he waited several minutes for most of the alligators to clear before he proceeded			1
an alligator bumped the boat behind him but was n't injured , @entity9 said			1
the videos were posted by the @entity104			0
@entity9 said he hopes to show additional footage to school groups			1
" by no means is the swamp dangerous , " he said			0
" it 's probably something i never will see again			0
" @entity9 had additional luck that saturday , catching his limit of jackfish and warmouth perch			1
life has almost returned to normal at @entity11 , which is near the town of @entity117			2
@entity120 sightings are at normal levels , it 's hot and the park 's beauty awaits visitors			0
@entity45 is n't sure whether @entity9 's encounter will bring more campers and boaters , but it sure has raised interest in the behavior of alligators			1
" you can never predict what they are going to do , " @entity33 said .			0

@entity13 *fisherman* 's camera catches 300 alligators hunting together
officials in @entity34 says such behavior is *unusual*
@entity9 was heading out to fish at @entity11
alligators were likely eating mudfish ( bowfin )
