-- it came as no surprise to a woman we 'll call @entity5 when , after 16 years of marriage , she and her husband started discussing the possibility of divorce			1
deep down she 'd never believed her marriage , or any marriage , could be genuinely happy			1
still , the reality was crushing			1
" i was desperate , " she says			1
" i thought , ' i 'd do anything to feel better			1
' " how about singing every day , making lists of things that made her happy , and getting a " joy buddy " ? those are among the suggestions given in @entity22 , a class taught by @entity24 , a meditation instructor and founding teacher of @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
a series of exercises , lectures , and meditations stretched over 10 months , awakening @entity34 is designed to bring more happiness to people 's lives			1
like some participants , @entity5 , who heard about the program while attending a meditation retreat at @entity27 , initially balked at the idea of singing			1
" i thought @entity24 wanted me to join a choir , " she says , " but i took it on faith that the singing was going to work			1
" so she started trilling along with the " @entity49 " soundtrack while driving			1
" it seemed ridiculous , but that 's what initially helped me the most			1
" " the course uses practices that lead the mind toward states of happiness and well - being , " says @entity24			1
" in other words , it teaches you to focus on how it feels to feel good			1
" the first and most important step , he says , is intention : making the decision to be happy			1
@entity67 , @entity68 , author of " happiness now ! timeless wisdom for @entity72 " and director of the @entity74 in the @entity75 , agrees that this is key			1
" intention is another word for focus			1
whatever you focus on will become more apparent and will grow			1
for centuries , optimists and pessimists have argued over who 's right , and the answer is they both are ; each sees what they 're looking for			1
if you focus on happiness , that 's what you become more aware of			1
" once participants have made up their minds to be happier , @entity24 gives them the tools -- delivered in lectures to the live class he teaches in @entity95 and in twice - monthly e-mails sent to participants in other areas -- to teach them how to cultivate a positive state of mind			1
among them : writing what the word joy means to you doing some form of physical movement -- such as yoga , dance , or walking -- a few times a week making a " nourishment list " of activities you enjoy , checking off those you do regularly and circling the ones that could be done more often checking in with your " joy buddy , " a kind of running partner in the pursuit of happiness			1
" that 's important , " says @entity67			1
" one of the major blocks to happiness is a sense of isolation			1
if you 're alive , you need help			2
" there are also guided meditations , including instructions on how to be mindful -- being present for whatever you 're doing and , as @entity24 says , " simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different			2
" for @entity5 , that turned out to be a bigger challenge than singing -- especially when her husband suggested that they begin the separation process			2
" @entity34 is n't about being a happy little do bee , " she says			1
" you 're taught that when feelings arise , no matter what they are , you stay with them			2
when my husband said we should contact a mediator , i cried years of tears			2
but by accepting those painful feelings , i had a watershed moment : i realized that i really wanted this marriage			2
" rather than assuming divorce was inevitable , @entity5 started to see other possibilities			2
" from that day to this , it 's been a whole different experience , " she says			2
" my husband and i are still together , and in a way that i honestly did n't think was possible			2
" for @entity24 , the best testimonials come from former skeptics ; he admits that he himself would n't be the best case study			2
" i 've always been a relatively joyful , celebratory kind of person , " he says			2
he found his spiritual path in @entity162 , but when his studies became very serious , so did he			2
" then i realized that the @entity164 was called the @entity165 , and he said , ' go for the highest happiness			2
' that became the focus of my teaching			1
" ( @entity24 points out that one need n't be a @entity170 , or of any particular faith , to reap the benefits of @entity34			1
" ministers , rabbis , and secular experts have successfully used these basic principles , " he says			2
) the idea for the course began eight years ago , when @entity24 's wife , @entity179 , gave him a book called " how we choose to be happy , " by @entity182 and @entity183			2
" the instructions made a lot of sense , but they did n't have a spiritual dimension , " @entity24 says			2
" so i added that and presented it as a series of talks with my weekly meditation group for about three months to see what would happen			0
" the results : " we got happier and happier ! " @entity24 then turned @entity34 into a six - month class and found that participants maintained a positive attitude even after it ended ( as long as they practiced the exercises ; as with diets or working out , continuity is essential )			1
word of mouth about the course that could make people happier began to spread : the first round of @entity22 meetings consisted of about 40 members			1
the next numbered 100 ; the next , 200 , and then 500			0
it went international when its members began e-mailing their monthly homework assignments from the lectures to friends			0
@entity24 was thrilled to receive messages from strangers in @entity215 , @entity216 , and @entity217			0
" it works ! " they wrote			0
apparently , you did n't have to be there to get the joy			1
nor do you have to be the type who can deftly turn a frown upside down			0
" i 'm the person who walks into a nicely designed room and notices only that the painting was hung too high , " says @entity226 , age 56			0
in addition to being a " serious " woman from a depressive family , @entity226 also found herself in chronic pain after sustaining a back injury			0
" it was horrible , " she recalls			0
" @entity237 made me sick			0
i felt guilty about not being able to work , and i thought people were judging me			0
" though a specialist was able to alleviate some of her physical discomfort , @entity226 fell into a deep depression			0
she heard about @entity243 after taking @entity24 's meditation classes at @entity27			0
" the first thing i was hit by was the instruction to notice what it feels like when you 're happy , " she says			0
" i loved the walks i took to help my back , but before , i just plodded down the street , not noticing anything			0
now i 'm aware of how i feel when i 'm walking , which enhances my enjoyment			0
" writing lists of things she 's grateful for was also a big help			0
" a lot of my seriousness has lifted , " she says			0
" i have a lighter heart			0
i still have chronic pain , but i know there 's a lot to feel good about			0
" @entity24 is writing a book about @entity34 and the people who now routinely roll up the windows in their cars so they can sing as loudly as they want to			1
" more than 2,000 people have tested it , so it 's not some airy - fairy idea , " he says			0
" i 've learned that it 's possible to change , no matter what your history or the limiting beliefs you 've held on to			0
if you have the intention to be happy and you do the practices , if you give it your best shot and are very patient , it works			0
" we 're all so used to thinking that we 'll finally be content when we find the perfect partner , lose weight , or get our dream job			1
is it really possible to become happier just by deciding you can ? " we use the language of having , getting , and chasing to describe happiness , rather than being , " says @entity67			0
" what we 've learned about happiness is that it is n't an it or a thing			0
research has proven that there is no one set of circumstances that makes someone happy ; it 's more about having a healthy mental attitude toward whatever you 're experiencing			0
so , you can either chase happiness or you can choose to be happy			0
it really is that simple			0
