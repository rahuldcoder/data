@entity1 @entity0 is eyeing another shot at the @entity4 , but many @entity5 , including those who admire and respect the party 's most recent nominee , are wondering exactly what rationale he has for mounting another campaign in 2016			1
after all , in 2012 @entity0 lost all but one of the battleground states , trailed president @entity14 332 - 206 in electoral votes and @entity5 panned his gaffe - prone campaign , chaotic convention and creaky tech operation			1
one working theory behind @entity20 -- he thinks he got it right on the big issues that decided the last election and that voters have got buyers remorse			2
" he is been proven right on so many of the issues , certainly domestic policy but ( also ) foreign policy			2
he almost looked prophetic there talking about @entity32 and talking about the war on terror , " said @entity29 @entity28 rep. @entity28 on @entity2 's " @entity30 " on sunday			1
aides have told reporters , including @entity2 's @entity37 , that @entity0 sees vindication in a world tipping into chaos and an economic recovery that left the middle class behind			1
at the @entity5 's winter meeting in @entity44 on friday , @entity0 said he has given " serious consideration " to a new run for the presidency , and his lacerating criticism of @entity14 suggested he believes he has earned his chance			1
so how do @entity0 's critiques and promises stand up as he yet again sets foot on the road to the @entity4 ? foreign policy @entity0 's best case for proving he was right may lie overseas			1
not even the most committed @entity14 supporter could convincingly argue that the world is more stable than in 2012			2
it 's only two years since the president brandished his own first term record of ending wars and killing @entity62 to pound @entity0 as heir to a disastrous @entity5 foreign policy legacy			1
but assumptions underpinning @entity14 's statesmanship have started to fray			2
the rise of @entity69 has raised questions about his decision to pull all troops out of @entity74 and his reluctance to plunge into @entity77 's civil war			2
the standoff with @entity79 has left his " reset " of relations with @entity32 looking naive			1
" the results of the @entity84 / @entity14 foreign policy have been devastating , " @entity0 said friday , arguing that terrorist attacks in places like @entity87 and @entity88 proved " the world is not safer			1
" as he watched crises consume @entity14 's foreign policy last year , @entity0 penned an ' i told you so ' op - ed in the @entity95 entitled " @entity96			1
" " able leaders anticipate events , prepare for them , and act in time to shape them , " @entity0 wrote			1
" some simply can not envision the future and are thus unpleasantly surprised when it arrives			2
some simply hope for the best			2
others succumb to analysis paralysis , weighing trends and forecasts and choices beyond the time of opportunity			0
" many @entity0 aides believe @entity32 proves his point			1
in the 2012 campaign , long before @entity79 annexed @entity112 , the @entity5 said that @entity32 " is without question our no. 1 geopolitical foe			1
" @entity14 reacted with derision			0
" the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the @entity120 's been over for 20 years , " he crowed in the third presidential debate			0
but time has n't been kind to that zinger			0
while there is a debate whether @entity1 and @entity32 are really locked in a true @entity120 , the @entity123 is doing a passable imitation of the @entity127			1
@entity32 aircraft are buzzing @entity130 planes in @entity131 and @entity32 stands accused of incursions in @entity133			1
@entity134 rewrote the borders of @entity131 by biting off @entity112 and @entity79 warns the @entity136 wants to " chain " the @entity32 bear			1
while @entity0 predicted @entity134 's belligerence , it 's impossible to know whether tougher @entity142 rhetoric would have changed @entity79 's calculations -- or antagonized him even more			1
and the administration argues that far from being the actions of a geopolitical foe , @entity79 's nationalism represents the thrashings of a weakened and desperate regime , that hardly poses a threat to the @entity142			2
and @entity14 might have adopted a tougher approach to @entity32 himself , had he not had to coax along @entity131 nations who were more reluctant than @entity1 to impose sanctions			1
some of @entity0 's other 2012 foreign policy bets are yet to play out			1
he said that @entity157 's nuclear program is potentially the longest term threat to the @entity142			2
" if we re-elect @entity14 , @entity157 will have a nuclear weapon , " he said in a @entity5 debate in 2011			0
so far , @entity157 has not gone nuclear			0
@entity14 says an interim deal has frozen @entity164 's atomic advances and a final pact is being sought to stop the @entity166 short of the bomb			0
on @entity74 , @entity0 hammered @entity14 in 2012 for not reaching a deal with @entity169 to leave a residual force behind after the war			1
@entity14 pounced , saying that meant his opponent wanted to keep @entity142 troops in the country			0
two years on the tables have turned and @entity14 has dispatched up to 3,000 troops to train @entity74 forces to take on @entity69 -- though the administration insists that they will not be doing any fighting			0
@entity0 was also spot on when he warned the next few years would bring more " chaos and tumult " in the @entity184 and that " jihadists " would continue to spread			1
but given the region 's agonized history , it hardly takes a strategic genius to make such a prediction			0
the economy @entity0 argued in 2012 that @entity14 's economic policy led to an anemic recovery from the worst recession in 70 years			1
he complained @entity14 broke his promise to cut the budget deficit in half and cited @entity197 ( @entity197 ) figures projecting trillion dollar deficits for four years following 2014			0
while @entity0 was wrong about that , the latest @entity197 estimates do offer some support to his wider point			1
the nonpartisan body expects the deficit to only be around $ 500 billion in 2015 but sees a rising trend with trillion dollar deficits in 2022 through 2024 owing to higher health care costs and rising interest payments on federal debt			0
@entity0 's critique of the uneven economic recovery is also accurate			1
" if you are elected president , we will continue to see a middle class squeeze with wages going down , " he said in the first debate			0
he warned that if @entity14 got four more years in the @entity4 , the national debt would approach $ 20 trillion			2
the figure is now $ 18 trillion			0
but @entity0 's claim the @entity142 economy is on " the road to @entity224 " was always hyperbole			1
@entity0 also underestimated the pace of the recovery			1
" you 're going to get a repeat of the last four years , " he said at the second presidential debate			0
he promised to get unemployment under 6 % or lower in his first term			0
consider that promise beaten -- by @entity14			0
in december , the jobless number was 5.6 %			0
@entity0 also promised to create 12 million jobs			2
in the first two years of @entity14 's second term the economy has pumped out 5.2 million jobs and could approach @entity0 's target before he leaves office			1
last year was @entity142 's top year of job growth since 1999			0
but @entity5 still call this the slowest economic recovery on record			2
health care nowhere was the 2012 debate more intense or more dripping with spin and falsehoods than @entity247 -- on both sides			2
in almost every campaign rally , @entity0 claimed the average @entity142 family would see health costs rise by $ 2,500 annually because of the president 's reforms			1
statistics do n't yet offer a full picture of @entity247 's impact on costs -- and the law has so upended the health care industry it is difficult to draw firm conclusions			0
but a @entity263 survey found that health care costs for family coverage in employer - sponsored plans rose 3 % in 2014 , well below @entity0 's figure			2
in the wider marketplace , the picture is complicated because some people who did not have health care before can now get it under @entity247			0
others have chosen better plans now available which may cost more			0
and some patients who bought @entity247 are now paying less for health care			0
total spending for health care in the nation rose 3.6 % in 2013 , slower than the 4.1 % rise the year before , according to the @entity279			0
growth in private health insurance premiums meanwhile grew at 2.8 % in 2013 compared to 4.0 % the year before			0
but @entity5 point to extra costs -- claiming for instance that many people now face higher deductables			0
@entity0 was correct to say however that millions of @entity142 would lose their insurance policies under @entity247 , rejecting the president 's health care whopper " if you like your health plan you can keep your health plan			2
" but that 's only half the story			0
while many people lost plans -- some because they did not reach quality thresholds set by @entity247 -- the @entity4 says millions also signed up to new policies			0
statistics from the @entity299 bear out that claim , finding that in the first half of 2014 , 12.2 % of @entity142 had no health insurance , compared to 17.3 % the year before .			0

@entity0 feels vindication over 2012 campaign
warned @entity32 was a threat and of chaos in the @entity184
but @entity0 underestimated the pace of economy recovery
