-- a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get rock - star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they 're supposed to hate -- government			1
it 's called @entity12 , and it 's a little bit like a @entity14 for geeks			2
we select a few fellows every year , and we have them work with city governments			1
instead of sending them off into the @entity20 , we send them into the wilds of @entity22			0
and there they make great apps and work with city staffers			1
but really what they 're doing is showing what 's possible with technology today			0
watch @entity32 's @entity31 one of the applications the @entity12 fellows wrote last year is called @entity35			1
it lets @entity37 sign up to dig out fire hydrants when they 're covered in snow			0
this is a modest little app , probably the smallest of the 21 apps the fellows built			0
but it 's doing something that very few government technologies are doing : it 's spreading virally			1
it 's open - source , so anyone can take the code			0
@entity51 in the it department of the @entity53 found it and realized he could use it to recruit citizens to check on the tsunami sirens in his city to make sure they 're functioning			1
@entity60 is planning to use it to get citizens to clear clogged storm drains			0
@entity64 has rolled it out to let people sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows			0
there are now nine cities we know of looking to use this app , and it 's happening organically , frictionlessly			0
@entity31 : being young and making an impact this app invites us to think a little differently about government			1
this is not how government normally procures software ; that 's generally a multi-year process			1
one of our teams of fellows built a web app for parents trying to find the right public school for their kids			0
the project took two fellows about two - and - a - half months			1
we were told that if it had gone through normal government channels , it would have taken two years and cost over $ 2 million			1
so an app that takes just a few days to write and spreads virally is a shot across the bow to the institution of government			1
it suggests how government might work more like the internet itself : @entity100 , open , generative			1
but what 's more important is how a new generation is tackling the problem of government , not as the problem of an ossified institution , but as a problem of collective action			1
this is good news , because it turns out we have actually gotten very good at enabling collective action with digital technology			0
and when we can put aside all the emotional baggage we all carry about government , government is simply what we do together			1
if you 've given up on government , i would ask you to reconsider -- because government is changing			2
technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government by being a platform for citizens to help themselves and help others			2
adopt - a - hydrant is a small example of government as a platform , but the story of the possums in @entity130 adds another element			2
many cities now have a 311 line , where citizens can report issues			0
but some of them also have web and mobile apps that do the same thing , and there 's a difference			0
when you call in , it 's person - to - person communication			0
if you use the app , your service request is public			0
one day , on @entity130 's 311 app , a resident reported a possum in her trash can , wondering if it was alive , and asked for help from the city in getting it removed			2
but because it was public , a neighbor saw it , and commented : " walked over to @entity159			0
turned the trash can on its side			0
good night , sweet possum			0
" in this case , a citizen helped another citizen , but government had a critical role : it connected them , and it could have connected them to government services if they 'd been needed			2
but a neighbor helping a neighbor strengthens a community			0
sending out @entity178 just costs money ! @entity31 : @entity181 's radical idea -- charter cities we have this opportunity to reframe government in very promising ways , but " we the people " are going to have to do few things differently if we want this to work			2
for one , we need to understand that government is not the same thing as politics , and that voting ca n't be our only input into the system of government			1
how often have we elected a new political leader and then expected everything to change ? that does n't work , because government is like a vast ocean , and politics is like the 6 - inch layer on top			1
what 's under that is bureaucracy			2
and the contempt that most people have for that word disempowers us			0
it allows a system that we own , and we pay for , to forever be something that works against us			0
people seem to think politics is sexy , but if we want this institution to work for us , we 're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy -- because that 's where the real work of government happens			1
we ca n't do without government , but we do need it to be more effective			1
secondly , we need to remember that we 're not just consumers			0
and we are not going to fix government if we do n't also fix citizenship			1
@entity31 : make data more human the good news is there 's a generation that has grown up on the @entity228 and knows that it 's not that hard to do things together			2
members of this generation have grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted			2
they have dozens of channels where they can express their opinions about any topic , so when they 're faced with the problem of government , they do n't care as much about using their voices			1
they 're using their hands			0
they 're using their hands to write applications that make government work better , but they 're also writing apps that let us use our hands to make our communities work better : shoveling out a fire hydrant , pulling a weed , or turning over a garbage can for a neighbor			2
so , when it comes to the big important things we need to do together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity32 .			1

@entity32 : a new generation has the potential to *reinvent* government
her program puts software experts in city halls , leading to a flurry of innovation
she says projects that would have taken years and millions can be done *cheaply* in months
@entity32 : to overhaul government , electing leaders is n't enough ; bureaucracy must be changed
