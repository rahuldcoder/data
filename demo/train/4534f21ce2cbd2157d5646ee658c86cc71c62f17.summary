-- @entity5 's deadly " @entity4 " returned sunday night with one ominous rallying cry -- " all men must die " -- and few disappointments			1
now that it 's in its fourth season , the fantasy series could be excused if it started to show wear and tear			1
after all , we 've seen programs with simpler plots and fewer cast members lose their edge in less time			0
but sunday 's premiere , " @entity17 , " proved that creators @entity19 and @entity20 are just getting started			1
( in fact , the only real letdown for fans did n't have anything to do with " @entity4 " at all , but @entity5 's mobile platform @entity25 , which crashed due to an overwhelming demand for sunday 's premiere			1
) @entity25 crashes under heavy ' @entity4 ' demand adapted from @entity32 's " @entity31 " book series , " @entity4 " is at its heart a bloody race for power between competitive houses in @entity39			1
after the third season left avid watchers in a state of shock thanks to a gruesome wedding ceremony , they returned on sunday to find the " @entity4 's " major players repositioning themselves on the board			1
with the famous @entity49 steel sword split in two by @entity50 ( @entity51 ) , viewers were made keenly aware of the fissures that abound throughout the @entity53			0
@entity54 ( @entity55 ) is building an army while trying to keep a handle on her still - growing dragons , and @entity59 ( @entity60 ) has begun to cross out names on her list of vengeance			0
in the @entity66 , the @entity64 -- or the @entity65 as they 're called -- have their eyes trained on breaching the @entity68 where the men of the @entity70 , including a @entity71 ( @entity72 ) ready to pay for his broken vows , stand guard			0
and in @entity53 , where the precious @entity53 sits , the ruthless and rich @entity76 are not as secure as they 'd like to believe			0
with a grand wedding approaching for the young @entity79 , there are visitors from @entity81 afoot -- and they , too , like to pay their debts			0
" right off the bat , season four sends the viewer a signal : forget the @entity91 you knew , " warns the @entity88 's @entity87 , who gave the episode a b + grade			2
" forget where on the board you 've mentally placed any of ' @entity4 '' chess pieces			2
it 's not a reboot , but ' @entity17 ' is a starting place that feels distinct			0
" while " fortunes have risen and fallen while we were away , and the awful power of @entity79 seeps deeply into the @entity53 , " the episode " stealthily belongs to the @entity99 -- who are down , but not out			0
that 's an enticingly rich way to begin a season			2
" @entity108 's @entity107 agrees that while " the @entity76 appear strong and unchallenged with the @entity99 out of the picture and @entity111 returned home only slightly worse for wear , the cracks are readily apparent			0
... by all accounts , the season - opener was setting the table for what promises to be a season filled with violence and intrigue			2
for now , the fear is only creeping in along the edges			0
once it arrives in full , that 's when the real fun is likely to begin			0
" it 's true that not much happened in the way of action -- by " @entity4 " standards , anyway -- but it was rich in character development , says the @entity133 's @entity132			1
" ( a ) nd character , ultimately , is what ' @entity4 ' does best , " he observes			1
" some viewers might even complain that there was n't enough sex or swashbuckling in ' @entity17 ' -- that the episode was ' slow			0
' but it is in these slow moments -- the moments between each big plot twist , when showrunners @entity20 and @entity19 decelerate the narrative to linger over the nuances of character -- that ' @entity4 ' truly distinguishes itself from other epic television series			1
" even better , the @entity150 's @entity149 says that the next two episodes should be just as good			1
" the consistent excellence in ' @entity4 ' is truly something to behold , " @entity149 says in a review			2
" even in three episodes , viewers will sense things tightening up -- that winter and war are coming and they are coming on full - stop			2
if there 's anything to complain about with ' @entity4 ' it 's the 10 - episode seasons , which cry out for 13 episodes given the immense world that ' thrones ' inhabits			1

" @entity4 " began its fourth season on sunday
*critics* say it *upheld* the show 's *reputation* as one of the best programs on tv
while it was n't as action - packed , it did *explore* character development
the *subsequent* two episodes are *expected* to be just as good
