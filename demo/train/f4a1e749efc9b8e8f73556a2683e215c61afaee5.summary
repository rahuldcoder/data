@entity2 explorer @entity0 spent 17 years working in the court of @entity5 's @entity4 , but today most foreigners seeking to live and work in the country are n't looking for the same time - invested cultural exchange			1
" it 's the place to make money , " explained @entity9 , a @entity10 who has lived in the southern @entity13 metropolis of @entity14 for four years			1
work as a fashion model has taken @entity19 across @entity4 and the rest of @entity21 , but " now it 's time to find a real career , " she said last month , in an overly - illuminated hotel conference room in the city 's @entity25			1
like hundreds of other visitors from across the world , the graduate in software development from @entity29 was there for the @entity33 for @entity34 ; one of three annual events organized by the @entity13 government , where expats get a rare chance to meet prospective employers face - to - face			1

while economic growth in @entity4 has slowed in the last year , the 7 % to 8 % predicted growth is positively booming compared to @entity47 and the @entity48 , leading many to believe their prospects there might be better than at home			1
however the perception that expats , particularly from western countries , can just walk into a job or career in @entity4 is now out of date			2
" the novelty of being a foreigner has worn off , " said @entity60 - based @entity59 , regional director in @entity4 for recruitment firm @entity61			2
" employers are seeking value			0
demonstrating a genuine commitment to @entity4 is key			0

it 's a figure that is set to increase in the coming years as @entity4 expands its number of higher education institutions , adding to the challenge for foreigners embarking on their careers in the country			1
" that side of the workforce there 's almost an oversupply of junior end candidates , " said @entity59			0
" so it 's hard for expats to compete			1
without @entity94 or local language skills i 'd say it 's almost impossible			1
" @entity96 , ceo at @entity4 , advises graduates to have a cv in both @entity99 and @entity13 , even if they do n't speak the language , and that taking the initiative and targeting prospective employers and @entity13 companies is the best path to a job			1

the recruitment process in @entity4 could also seem quite strange to many westerners			0
" at a market in @entity4 you 're expected to haggle and that applies in some way to job negotiations			0
@entity143 do n't want to feel like they 're haggling over their life , they want to feel wanted , " said @entity96			0
however a larger trend is localizing the workforce across positions , believes @entity59			0
if the employers he recruits for have a wish - list it is usually for a @entity13 national who has gained many years of experience studying or working abroad			2
these " haigui , " or sea turtles as they are called in @entity4 , hit the employment sweet spot with " both the cultural connection and the language skills , " according to @entity59			2
" they provide a pretty good compromise between being able to connect and communicate with local @entity13 staff , but have a good understanding of western business and management practice			2
they bridge the two worlds quite well			0
