-- when i first meet @entity3 she 's as tight - lipped as a closed door			1
this is a woman who does n't do idle chit chat			2
why would you when you 're the world 's most famous female architect ? asked if people needed to be a little afraid of her , the brusque answer is " no , " before shooting me a case - closed expression			1
" i think people are always intimidated by something			2
i do n't do things that scare people off			2
" " full of lies , " is her response , when i refer to one article in which she demanded flight crew swap her plane , while taxiing on a runway			2
forty minutes later , @entity3 has softened somewhat , opening the door on a remarkable life that began in 1950s @entity30 , before smashing through the " boy 's club " of international architecture , to become one of the most celebrated -- and divisive -- designers on the planet			1
perhaps the urban legends about her formidable demeanor are part of the mystique that has built up around the 63 - year - old @entity42 - born @entity41 , who today boasts over 400 staff and 950 projects in 44 countries -- including plans for @entity48 's 2020 @entity47 and the recently opened @entity49 in @entity51 's @entity50			1
dozens of models of @entity3 's distinctive white , sweeping , space - age designs sit on undulating plinths in her gallery in east @entity51 's fashionable @entity58			1
the installation is called " @entity66 , " and sitting a little behind this mini metropolis is the creator herself , dressed in a black cloak at a long table of rippling glass			0
" frames like veins " her latest project is for @entity72 superyacht builders @entity73 -- the same company behind billionaire businessman @entity76 's " @entity75 , " the second - largest private yacht in the world			1
on the wall behind her , a plasma screen flashes computer - generated images of her six boats , their gleaming exoskeleton frames seamlessly weaving together each luxurious level			1
they range from a 128 - meter " master prototype " to a 90 - meter version called " @entity89			1
" there 's barely a right angle in sight			1
so just what goes on in the mind of an architect who has created buildings with the most intriguing shapes ? " the idea was that the frames could be like veins , " explained @entity3			1
" i like this kind of project because every time you do them , you learn about some other type of parameters which you had not always considered			0
" unfortunately , architecture , as much as we 'd like it to float , it does n't			0
that 's one thing that 's different -- architecture is tied to gravity			1
" " i never took ' no ' for an answer " @entity117 across the sweeping roof of @entity3 's @entity119 or the overlapping limbs of @entity123 's @entity122 museum , and you get the feeling these fluid forms are not harnessed by gravity at all			1
for fans , they 're beguiling creations which redefined architecture for the modern age			0
for detractors , they 're overbearing and over budget			0
either way , there 's no denying @entity3 's phenomenal success , the first woman to win the @entity143 in 2004 -- regarded as architecture 's @entity144 -- and in the last decade going from the architect who never built anything to the architect who built everything			1
" i never took no for an answer			0
i never sat back and said ' walk all over me , it 's ok , ' " she says about her headstrong approach			1
" in @entity51 it was very timid , people behave well , they 're polite -- especially if you 're a woman			0
a woman should behave properly			0
it means that you do n't challenge the situation			0
" indeed , when @entity158 's @entity157 museum had an exhibition of her work in 2003 , attendants wore t - shirts emblazoned with @entity3 quotes such as , " would they still call me a diva if i was a man ? " is there a defiant twinkle in her eye as she recalls the incident ? " if you 're a man you 're seen as someone who 's tough and ambitious , " she says			1
" but when a woman is ambitious it 's seen as bad			1
i think things have changed in the last 20 years			0
but there 's still prejudice			1
" from an outside perspective , @entity3 's determination has paid off , finally cracking the notoriously masculine world of architecture			1
" i think it 's a boys ' club everywhere , " she says			2
" and i 'm not privy to that world so much -- they go fishing , they go golfing , they go out and have a drink			2
and as a woman you 're excluded from that bonding			0
it 's a big difference			2
" " we were building a new world " @entity3 grew up in a @entity198 - inspired home in @entity30 , her father leader of the @entity42 @entity200 , a man who highly valued education			1
she and her two brothers were sent to boarding school in @entity205 , before later gaining a degree in mathematics from the @entity208			0
as a teen she was inspired by a 1960s post-war boom in modernist architecture , when exciting new designs made the cover of @entity214			0
" there was a sense of optimism , we were building a new world that was demolished during the war , " she said			1
" there were new ideas , new materials			0
" at 22 she moved to @entity51 to train at the radical @entity223 , under the tutelage of influential @entity226 architect @entity225 , who famously called her " a planet in her own inimitable orbit			2
" what did he mean by that ? " i often wonder that myself , " @entity3 says with a chuckle , revealing a cheeky gap - toothed smile			1
" when he said it at the time , i was upset			0
but in a way he was right -- i should not have a conventional career and he was absolutely spot on			0
" the renegade planet that is @entity3 kept hurtling forward , setting up her own @entity51 practice and , in 1993 , completing her first building -- the @entity243 in @entity72			1
she recently returned for its 20th anniversary			0
" when i go back 20 years later , buildings look very different -- they 're either smaller or not as you expect them			0
" but it was the 1995 @entity250 in @entity251 -- a commission she won twice , but was thwarted by local politicians -- which nearly ended her career , and helped shape the steely woman who last year was honored by @entity257 for her services to architecture			0
" i know a lot of people thought i would give up , because it was such an awful , painful experience			0
i remember the day it happened i thought , ' i will not let this finish me			0
' in a way , it saved me			0
i think it did make me stronger , " she said			0
" i would n't build a prison " today , it 's difficult to imagine many developers turning down the celebrity architect , her buildings dotted everywhere from @entity272 to @entity273			1
is she concerned about the human rights credentials of the countries she works in ? " as an architect , if you can in any way alleviate an oppressive situation , or elevate a culture , then i think that you should			2
it 's different if someone asks you to build a prison -- i would n't do it			2
but if i 'm doing a museum or a library , i think that 's different , " she said			2
and the conditions of the construction workers ? " it 's not your responsibility really			1
i think different nations should take care of their workforce			0
" as an architect , if you are involved in every layer then honestly you do n't do anything			2
i 'm not saying i should n't be thinking about it , but i think it 's a job for the politicians , for the media , for the locals , to deal with it			2
" one country yet to host a @entity3 original is her native @entity42 , though she has been commissioned to build @entity30 's new central bank -- when that will actually happen is anyone 's guess			1
but you get the feeling that no matter how hugely successful @entity3 is , she will always paint herself as the feisty underdog -- as much a part of her distinctive brand as undefinable space - age shapes			1
" when you 're younger you just want to bang ahead			0
but it is very tiring , this constant fighting , " she said			0
" of course , we are more accepted now , but there 's always a reminder of the time when they resisted -- the only fundamental difference is before they resisted because they thought we were crazy			2
" now they resist because they think we 're successful			0
