-- armed renegade soldiers walked through @entity3 's damaged presidential palace on thursday , hours after the troops ' leaders claimed to have ousted the @entity8 nation 's democratically elected leader			1
@entity10 casings , bullet - ridden cars and shattered windows were evident in video from outside the palace , as well as at least one burned - out room inside			0
and there was no sign of or indication of what happened to president @entity20 , with the military group 's apparent leader capt. @entity23 saying little about him beyond that he was " safe			0
" still , within much of @entity3 on thursday night , the situation appeared to be relatively calm as most people appeared to have abided by coup leaders ' call for a nighttime curfew			1
@entity30 , a spokesman for the troops behind the apparent coup , asked citizens to return to their jobs friday , though he gave no timetable as to when @entity3 's borders would reopen			1
earlier thursday , @entity30 was among a group of soldiers wearing fatigues who said on television that they had suspended the constitution and dissolved public institutions because of the government 's handling of an insurgency			1
" considering the incapacity of the regime in effectively fighting against terrorism and restoring dignity to the @entity3 people , using its constitutional rights , the armed forces of @entity3 , along with other security forces , have decided to take on their responsibilities to put an end to this incompetent regime of president @entity20 , " said @entity30			2
surgeons told an aid worker -- who asked to remain anonymous -- that 29 people who had been injured as a result of the recent unrest were in @entity66 's main hospital , while another nine were in a medical facility in @entity68 , about 18 kilometers ( 11 miles ) to the northwest			1
the worker , who is based in the nation 's capital , said he could n't detail how or how seriously these people were injured			2
it is unknown if anyone has been killed			0
as a precaution in case there 's more violence , the @entity76 is on call -- with one team set up ready to retrieve any wounded people and another positioned to help in @entity66 's main hospital should there be a staff shortage or other need for extra help -- the aid worker said			1
the uncertainty surrounding @entity20 , @entity3 's president , further complicated predictions as to what might happen next			1
a 1991 military coup led by @entity20 had ended a dictatorship in the landlocked @entity8 nation			0

hours before the latest coup 's leaders appeared on television , @entity20 posted a message on the official government @entity103 feed that he was writing from the palace to prove that he was still in charge			1
" deserters and other military personnel who do not want to go to the front are mutinied , " he said late wednesday			0
yet the next day , @entity109 , the @entity111 's under - secretary - general for @entity112 , stated that " clearly a coup d'eta has been carried out " -- a development that drew sharp criticism from other nations like the @entity117 and @entity118 , @entity3 's former colonial ruler			1
@entity118 foreign minister @entity120 said in a statement from @entity122 that his country " condemns in the strongest terms the violent overthrow of constitutional order			0

nearly 4,500 @entity118 citizens are registered with the embassy in @entity66 , @entity118 's @entity139 said			0
in a statement from @entity144 , its minister for @entity145 , @entity142 also criticized " any actions which undermine democratic rule and the @entity3 constitution			2
" this sentiment was echoed by @entity150 , chairman of the @entity152 , and @entity111 chief @entity153 , who called for a peaceful resolution			2
the @entity117 , furthermore , called for " the immediate restoration of constitutional rule in @entity3 , including full civilian authority over the armed forces and respect for the country 's democratic institutions and traditions			2
" previously , @entity117 officials had described @entity3 as " one of the strongest democracies on the continent			2
" " our focus and our hope and expectation is that this military action can be quickly reversed , and we can get back to the issue of democratic governance in @entity3 , which we can all support , " said @entity174 spokeswoman @entity173 , adding there are discussions but no decisions yet on whether @entity179 will suspend any or all of the roughly $ 140 million in aid that it sends annually to @entity3 's government			1
a delegation from the @entity183 was caught up in the chaos in the capital thursday			0

@entity191 foreign minister @entity190 said in a @entity193 post that he 'd been holed up inside a hotel in @entity3 's capital , where he had been attending a regional peace and security meeting			1
heavier gunfire can be heard repeatedly , " he wrote thursday			0
a later statement , from his nation 's foreign ministry , said that @entity191 's government was in " direct communication " with @entity190 and others and working with " the @entity111 and other friendly countries " to get him and others out of @entity3			1
@entity30 , the spokesman for the soldiers who claim they 've taken control , said @entity3 security forces have formed the @entity214 ( @entity215 ) to work as a transitional government			1
he accused the government of not providing soldiers with the means to battle local @entity221 nomads , who have long called for the creation of an independent state and have risen up against the @entity3 government a number of times since the 1960s			1
the indigenous tribe are spread across @entity3 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232			0
the latest uprising began to take root late last year but gained momentum in january , when the rebels began attacking towns in northern @entity3			0
and it 's been further energized by an influx of fighters who had been fighting on behalf of former @entity229 ruler @entity241			0
@entity109 , from the @entity111 , said the return of 1,500 to 2,000 fighters from @entity229 " clearly added much firepower and drive " to the insurgency			0
the growing @entity221 insurgency has raised concerns in @entity179 , which sees @entity3 as an important ally against @entity249 , the @entity251 offshoot of the terrorist group			0
the ongoing violence between these rebels and security forces has compelled tens of thousands of @entity3 to flee into neighboring countries and created turmoil in @entity20 's administration			2
conflict in the region has forced the @entity111 to appeal for $ 35.6 million to address the growing humanitarian crisis as throngs of @entity3 flee into neighboring countries			2
the @entity111 spokesman predicted that the coup would only worsen the security situation in northern @entity3 , and further empower the rebels			1
" this kind of action could pose great difficulties against the effort in the north and ... can further ( the insurgents ' ) actions and what they are trying to do , " @entity109 said			1
