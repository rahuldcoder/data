-- @entity2 secretary of defense @entity1 warned that @entity3 must improve its relations with neighboring countries , saying the country is becoming increasingly isolated in the region			1
@entity1 made the comments ahead of his arrival monday in @entity3 , where he will meet with @entity3 and @entity11 leaders in an effort to jump start peace talks			1
" i do n't think there is any question in talking with leaders from @entity3 that they recognize that they 've becoming increasingly isolated in that part of the world , and that 's not ... a good situation , " @entity1 told reporters while en route late sunday to @entity3			1
" i think they recognize that it 's important to do whatever they can to try to improve those relations			0
" tensions in the region have been running high in recent weeks over the @entity30 's bid for statehood before the @entity32 , and @entity3 's plans to build 1,100 new homes in disputed territory in south @entity36			1
" the important thing there is to again reaffirm our strong security relationship with @entity3 , to make clear that we will protect their qualitative military edge , " @entity1 said			1
" as they take risks for peace , we will be able to provide the security that they will need in order to ensure that they can have the room hopefully to negotiate			0
" @entity1 said he plans to offer @entity2 help to @entity3 to improve its deteriorating relationships with some of its neighbors , particularly @entity54 and @entity55			1
" it 's pretty clear , that at this dramatic time in the @entity59 when there have been so many changes , that it is not a good situation for @entity3 to become increasingly isolated			1
and that 's what 's happening , " @entity1 said			2
" and i think for the security of that region , it 's very important that we do everything possible to try to help them re-establish relations with countries like @entity54 and with @entity55			2
" @entity54 and @entity3 have been at odds following the deaths of nine @entity54 activists during an @entity3 commando raid last year on the @entity77 , part of a flotilla of ships that was headed to blockaded @entity80			2
last month , @entity54 prime minister @entity81 expelled @entity3 's ambassador over that nation 's refusal to apologize for the incident			0
public opposition in @entity55 , meanwhile , against its peace treaty with @entity3 appears to be growing			2
protesters last month attacked @entity3 's embassy			0
@entity1 will follow up his trip to @entity3 with a stop in @entity55 , where he said he will encourage leaders to proceed with a promised election process following the ouster of president @entity95			1
the defense secretary said there was little question @entity3 has maintained its military superiority in the region			1
" but the question you have to ask is , is it enough to maintain a military edge if you are isolating yourself diplomatically ? , " @entity1 said			2
" real security can only be achieved by both a strong diplomatic effort as well as a strong effort to protect your military strength			0
" @entity1 's visit to the region follows an @entity3 announcement sunday that it supports a call by the @entity114 -- made up of the @entity2 , the @entity32 , the @entity115 and @entity116 -- for direct talks with @entity11 to resume within a month			1
in a statement , the @entity3 prime minister 's office said @entity3 " welcomes the quartet 's call for direct negotiations between the parties without preconditions			0
" " while @entity3 has some concerns , it will raise them at the appropriate time , " the statement added			0
" @entity3 calls on the @entity30 to do the same and to enter into direct negotiations without delay			0
" @entity30 prime minister @entity130 has repeatedly said @entity11 would not return to negotiations until @entity3 halts all settlement construction and accepts 1967 border lines as a basis for the return to talks			2
@entity1 said he will stress to both @entity11 and @entity3 that rather than set conditions for negotiating , they look for other approaches to resolve the issues			1
" so my main message is , to both sides , you do n't lose anything by going into negotiations and trying to pursue a peace process everyone in the world is hopeful can begin , " he said			0
also on the agenda with @entity3 leadership is @entity151			0
@entity1 said the most effective way to deal with @entity151 " is not on a unilateral basis			0
" later , @entity1 will head to @entity154 , @entity155 , for a meeting of @entity158 defense ministers			1
the coalition has been involved in a number of ongoing military campaigns , including over @entity162 and in @entity163			0
