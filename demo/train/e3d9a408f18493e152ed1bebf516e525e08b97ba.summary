-- with the arrival of @entity3 , 100,000 attendees are expected to descend on @entity5 's @entity4 every day this weekend			1
the event has been sold out for several months , with @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 headlining in addition to an @entity12 - led reunion of @entity13			1
but equally important to @entity15 founder @entity14 is his contingent of top djs , which include @entity18 and @entity19			1
" we are now blowing out our dance artists			0
we have two electronic dance musicians headlining			0
one is justice , the other @entity25 , " he said with genuine excitement			0
dance artists are the new rock stars , and they 're commanding rock star salaries			2
" they 're making millions , " @entity14 said			1
" the agents are asking the same fees they would ask for a rock artist because they 're saying , ' look , we 're as attractive as a rock artist , so why should n't we be making the same amount of money ? ' " @entity14 's band , @entity35 , wo n't be performing at @entity36 this year , but on saturday night they 'll be playing an after - party at the nearby @entity38			1
although tickets sold out in five minutes , fans of the pioneering alternative group will be able to see the show via a 360 - degree live webcast			2
@entity15 has grown in size , but @entity14 hopes to restore some of the intimacy with after - parties -- both official and unofficial ( at last count , there were 31 official after - parties listed on the @entity15 website )			1
" we 're taking the city , and we 're filling the arteries of the city and its nightclubs and ballrooms with our @entity15 audience and musicians			1
we 're taking it up a notch , and we 're taking it to four in the morning , " he said			1
" i just love that			0
it 's not just @entity4 -- the whole city is alive ! " from 1991 - 1997 , @entity15 was a touring festival			1
it went on hiatus in 1998 , returned for one year in 2003 , then resurrected itself as a single location event in 2005			0
it has been an annual fixture in @entity4 ever since			0
in 2011 , @entity14 expanded the brand to @entity72 and @entity73 in 2012 , and will be making a big announcement about @entity15 's plans for expansion this sunday			1
( @entity77 : it 's not a @entity15 cruise			1
) back in @entity5 , doors have barely opened on @entity3 , but wheeling and dealing is already in motion to secure next year 's lineup			0
" you 've got to really work at it			0
you 've got to bring to the people something that they did n't expect , they wo n't forget and they 've never had before			0
it 's not easy to do that , " @entity14 said			2
" that 's something you have to pull out of the ether			0
" his dream headliner ? " there are a couple of legendary rock groups that i would love to get			0
most of the time , the reason that you do n't get to work with them is it 's their problem -- meaning they 're not together , or they broke up , or they hate each other or they 're not healthy			2
" but in the meantime , @entity14 already has one ace in the hole			2
" i already know who 's going to be headlining next year , " he said with a sly smile .			0

100,000 attendees a day are expected to visit @entity15 this weekend
the fest has grown in size , but founder @entity14 hopes after - parties will offer intimacy
headliners include @entity7 and @entity9
