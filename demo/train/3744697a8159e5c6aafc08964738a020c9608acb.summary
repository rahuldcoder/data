@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity3 have been duking it out in the @entity6 world over who 's scoring more points in high - stakes diplomatic wrangling over @entity11 , @entity3 president @entity12 or @entity2 president @entity13			1
@entity14 , @entity3 ambassador to the @entity15 , tweeted thursday : " three days ago there seemed no diplomatic way to hold @entity18 accountable			1
threat of @entity3 action finally brought @entity2 to the table			2
" in her tweet , @entity22 , head of @entity2 's @entity24 television network rt , quipped : " if the @entity2 proposal on @entity11 works , @entity12 , as an honest man , has to give his @entity28 to @entity13			1
" taking @entity11 's chemical weapons out of government control and preventing another horrendous attack on civilians is too serious an issue to reduce to political one - upmanship			1
but after @entity13 's bombshell opinion piece in the @entity40 in which , among other things , he takes @entity3 to task for an " alarming " pattern of intervening in the internal conflicts of foreign countries , it 's obvious something has shifted			2
" it absolutely is a diplomatic win by @entity13 right now , " said @entity46 , expert on @entity13 and director of the center on the @entity3 and @entity48 at the @entity49			1
" if we think about this as judo , which is of course mr. @entity13 's favorite sport , this is just one set of moves , " she said			2
" and right now , he 's managed to get @entity12 off the mat , at least , and get the terms set down that play to his advantage			2
" @entity13 's comments cause a fuss @entity13 stopped @entity12 's drive for military action against @entity11 in its tracks this week as @entity2 's plan to put @entity11 's chemical weapons under international control pushes the action to the @entity15 , just where @entity13 wants it			1
@entity2 has veto power in the @entity70 , and as @entity46 noted , it 's an " arena that they 're really very skilled at , which is usually blocking other people from getting resolutions or moving forward			0
" @entity13 's op - ed is not going down lightly in @entity75			1
@entity77 sen. @entity76 said the piece made him almost want to throw up			0
" mr. @entity13 's personality has been widely demonized in the western world , so anything that comes from mr. @entity13 will be met not only with skepticism but a lot of people will reject just out of hand anything that mr. @entity13 will say , " said @entity79 , director of the @entity80			2
" however , in this particular situation , when so many people are confused in the @entity3 , in @entity48 , including in the political classes of @entity82 countries , the arguments that @entity13 is making so clearly could be used in the domestic debate , " he added			0
analysis : is @entity12 a winner or loser on @entity11 ? @entity79 thinks @entity13 " is trying to insert himself and the @entity2 position into the debate that 's now ongoing on @entity100 , within the @entity3 more broadly , in the @entity48 countries			1
he does not want to leave the field to @entity103 alone			0
he wants to have a voice in that discussion			0
" @entity106 presents in his op - ed struck a chord with some in @entity75 , even if they dislike him			0
one example : " @entity11 is not witnessing a battle for democracy , but an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multi-religious country			0
there are few champions of democracy in @entity11			0
but there are more than enough @entity122 fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government			0
" other points , like his swipe at @entity12 's comment this week trumpeting @entity3 " exceptionalism , " are bound to irritate some of the @entity3 @entity13 is trying to sway			1
sen. @entity130 , a @entity131 from @entity132 , said thursday that " @entity13 was lecturing to the @entity3 , and i could hear ( @entity134 ) @entity133 turning over in his grave as this was going on			0
" some @entity2 claim that @entity12 " owes " @entity13 for getting him out of a bind			1
@entity138 , chairman of the @entity139 , tweeted tartly : " @entity12 should be ' for ' @entity2 's plan with two hands			1
it gives him a chance not to start a new war , not lose in the @entity145 , and not become another @entity146 , " referring to his predecessor			0
@entity46 said @entity13 did do @entity12 a favor			1
" for @entity13 , being the old @entity151 guy , having someone owe him something is always to his advantage , " she said			0
" but this is more about a win for @entity2 here			0
@entity2 gets an imminent @entity3 strike off the table for a while , " @entity46 said			2
the @entity159 is trying to throw the ball back to @entity13 , cautioning that his chemical weapons proposal will boomerang if it does n't work			1
@entity13 " now owns this			0
he has fully asserted ownership of it , and he needs to deliver , " a senior @entity159 official told @entity1			2
@entity166 , president of the @entity49 and former deputy secretary of state in the @entity169 administration , tweeted : " if @entity173 - @entity172 meeting exposes @entity2 proposal as sham , it will strengthen @entity12 's hand with @entity145 , assuring what @entity13 hopes to stop			1
" keep up with key developments in the @entity11 crisis			0

@entity12 and @entity13 in high - stakes diplomatic wrangling over @entity11
@entity13 gets upper hand by giving @entity12 way out of military strike for now
@entity11 chemical weapons issue now at @entity15 , just where @entity2 leader wants it
@entity159 tries to throw the ball back to @entity13 , saying he must deliver
