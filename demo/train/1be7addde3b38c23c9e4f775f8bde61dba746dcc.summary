@entity0 -- it 's sunday morning at the @entity3 in @entity0 , @entity4 , but the man preaching to the choir is no minister			1
" my @entity8 is not finished with me yet , " he tells the congregation			2
the man speaking is @entity9 -- ex-four - term @entity4 governor , ex-four - term congressman and ex-con			1
" i may be old and rancid butter , but i 'm on your side of the bread , " he proclaims from the altar			2
unrepentant and unapologetic , @entity9 is in church not looking for forgiveness			1
the 87 - year - old is looking for votes			2
after almost nine years in prison , the flamboyant showman of @entity4 politics has a fresh act -- running for @entity25 -- co-starring his 35 - year - old wife , @entity27 , and their 1 - year - old baby			1
this is his third marriage			2
ex-governor , convict @entity9 to run for @entity25 fifty years after his first stint on @entity33 , @entity9 would no doubt rather be running for governor again			1
but he 's running for a seat in @entity25 because @entity4 law does n't allow felons to run for state office -- until they 've been out of prison for 15 years			1
by then , @entity9 would be 98 -- so he 's taking this shot instead			1
former @entity4 governor released from prison his chances ? the district is now bright red , but never mind			1
political experts think @entity9 at least has a good shot of making it into a runoff because of his universal name recognition and the size of the field : he 's running against nine republicans , two other @entity54 and one @entity55			1
if no candidate gets 50 % in november , the top two then will face off in december			2
" he is gon na make the runoff hands - down unless some kinda @entity63 morning miracle happens and pushes him out , " says @entity58 , publisher of @entity60			2
@entity9 won the backing of state democrats last week			1
while @entity9 was happy to re-enter the political arena , his wife of four years was n't fully on board			1
did she want him to run ? " not particularly			2
i would naturally support him in whatever he chose to do , " @entity69 says			2
" but it 's not really my thing			0
" @entity9 ' relationship with @entity27 began as his prison pen pal , which led to love at first sight when she visited him			1
" i was expecting him to be angry or bitter , and he just was n't , " she tells us			0
as for @entity9 he recounts what she told him when they met			1
@entity9 : never profited from taxpayers " she said , ' if you do n't mind , i only live 30 minutes from here			1
i 'd like to come back and visit you			0
' that 's like throwin ' a rubber raft to a drowning man			0
" he went to prison in 2002 after a felony conviction of extorting millions in exchange for riverboat casino licenses -- and served his time			1
to this day , @entity9 says he never took a dime from the taxpayers			1
" in all this claptrap about how crooked i am and what i stole , nobody 's ever charged me , or accused me , of taking money from the taxpayers , " he tells @entity1			0
" it had nothin ' to do with my career as a public official			0
" former @entity4 gov. @entity9 gets 10 years in corruption case after getting free in january 2011 , he and @entity27 married			1
last year they had a son			0
so now @entity9 is the father to children in their 60s , a wife half their age and a baby			1
" he gets up with him in the morning , " @entity69 says			0
he bathes him , he puts his clothes on			0
" if this seems like a reality tv show it was -- briefly -- entitled " @entity120 " on the @entity119			0
what was it like for them doing it ? " it 's horrible , " she says			0
his take : " it was unbelievable			0
" the couple now says the whole thing was kind of annoying			0
the critics and viewers agreed			0
they admit they are bit of an odd couple -- and it 's not just age			0
@entity9 is an old - time populist @entity138 who wants to return to @entity25 exactly 50 years since his first stint there			1
when the 6th district congressional seat became open , he says he thought , " that 's my chance			0
i 've got a second chance , and i 'm going to take it			0
and i 'm gon na surprise everyone			0
" as for what he would say to those who ask about sending a convicted felon to @entity149 , " people say , well , they 're all crooks anyhow			0
you might as well send an experienced one			0
" the law finally catches up with @entity9			2
