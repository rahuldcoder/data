-- with her signature friday on @entity3 , gov. @entity1 launched @entity4 into a maelstrom of national controversy , community conflict and extreme fiscal risk			1
in doing so , she failed a basic test of courageous leadership -- recognizing and acting responsibly when political symbolism and populist pandering crosses into dangerous policy			0
the governor should have known better , if only because recent history demonstrates the folly in enacting measures like @entity4 's @entity3			1
@entity3 will be subject to multiple legal challenges , and the state will devote precious resources to defend a law that has so many serious constitutional flaws that it will likely never be implemented			2
the neighboring state of @entity25 faced this circumstance 15 years ago when gov. @entity27 championed @entity28 , enacted by voters in november 1994			0
over half a dozen lawsuits were on file within days of the law 's passage			0
a federal court soon enjoined all but two minor sections of the initiative , and the vast bulk of the law never took effect			0
yet , @entity25 not only paid a lot of state lawyers to defend these suits -- and ultimately paid much of the plaintiffs ' attorneys ' fees as well -- but also had to divert bureaucrats throughout state government from their other tasks to analyze and plan how to implement a law that could never be implemented			1
today , @entity25 could certainly use the tens of millions of dollars expended so many years ago vainly defending @entity28			0
moreover , even though @entity28 was never implemented , @entity25 suffered other repercussions besides the waste of limited state financial resources			2
community conflict increased as some interpreted the initiative 's passage as license for private individuals to harass and interrogate those they believed to be undocumented , which then , as now , was usually based on racial stereotype			0
in addition , support of @entity28 did not help @entity27 's political career , as naturalizations rose and an increasing number of angry @entity69 voters mobilized to oppose the governor and the political party that championed such a negative initiative			0
today , so many years later , the political sins of @entity27 continue to be visited upon the heads of @entity25 politicians from his political party			0
coincidentally , @entity4 's @entity3 suffers from many of the same constitutional flaws as @entity25 's @entity28			1
in particular , the claim that felled the @entity25 initiative applies in even greater measure to the @entity4 bill			1
the federal court struck down @entity28 as an unconstitutional attempt to regulate immigration , which is a role that belongs exclusively to the federal government			2
@entity3 is an even more direct attempt to establish the state 's own immigration law and enforcement scheme			1
indeed , what we have seen since friday is the usual pivot by those who propose and support unconstitutional laws like @entity3			0
sen. @entity96 and others who support the bill are now arguing it does nothing but reiterate existing federal law and that the law is legitimate because police officers always had " inherent authority " to enforce federal immigration law			1
their assertions are dubious as a legal matter because of the very weak support for the " inherent authority " notion and because , in the area of immigration , the states lack even the right to duplicate federal law word - for - word			1
beyond this , i am certain that neither sen. @entity96 nor gov. @entity119 would actually go into their next election campaigns asserting they expended significant time and state resources on a bill that does nothing to change existing law and authority			0
they and other proponents have at various times maintained , in more or less blatant contradiction of their rhetorical defense of the law 's constitutional propriety , that @entity3 is a much - needed change in current law that will strengthen @entity4			1
in fact , the pre-enactment characterization more accurately reflects the bill 's effects : @entity3 would dramatically change every @entity4 's daily experience , especially anyone whose appearance , name , language or accent fits the stereotype of the undocumented			2
it is this invitation or direction to police to engage in racial profiling , together with the state 's unconstitutional attempt to regulate immigration , that makes it unlikely that @entity3 can ever be implemented			2
nonetheless , @entity4 will experience extreme and dire consequences , just as @entity25 experienced a decade - and - a - half ago			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			0

new immigration law follows in *footsteps* of @entity25 's @entity164 . *187* , says @entity165
he says @entity25 found that its attempt to control immigration was *pre-empted* by federal law
@entity172 says @entity4 will have to expend resources to administer and flawed *legislation*
