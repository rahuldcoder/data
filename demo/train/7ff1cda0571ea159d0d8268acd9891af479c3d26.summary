-- as the leader of @entity4 's reform -- or reformasi -- movement , @entity1 has spent much of the past decade in court defending himself against sodomy charges			1
once one of former prime minister @entity11 's closest political allies -- and viewed by many as his heir apparent -- the 64 - year old grew up in the politically - charged environment of post-independence @entity4			1
he made his name as a student activist in various @entity18 youth groups in @entity19 in the late - 1960s , as the country reeled from the protracted @entity23 insurgency of the @entity24			1
arrested in 1974 in student protests against rural poverty , @entity1 was sentenced to 20 months in jail			2
despite his firebrand reputation , he later confounded liberal supporters in 1982 by joining the conservative @entity30 ( @entity30 ) led by @entity11			2
at the time , @entity11 's ability to bring @entity1 on board was seen as a master political stroke , effectively neutralizing a potentially powerful political opponent who risked joining the opposition @entity36 or @entity37			1
@entity1 found not guilty of sodomy he moved quickly through the political ranks throughout the 1980s , heading several ministries until he became deputy prime minister and the favored lieutenant of @entity11 in 1993			1
but by the end of the 1990s , the relationship had begun to sour as @entity1 became increasingly vocal about what he saw as widespread nepotism and cronyism within the @entity4 government			2
protectionist policies set up by @entity11 also came under fire from @entity1 , who supported the @entity52 's recovery plan for @entity4 following the @entity53			1
@entity1 instituted an austerity package that cut government spending by 18 % , cut ministerial salaries and put major infrastructure projects on hold			2
these mega-projects had been the cornerstone of @entity11 's development strategy and his opposition further strained the relationship			1
@entity11 , as prime minister , reversed several @entity66 decisions			0
nevertheless , the tough medicine of the @entity52 package meant @entity4 emerged from the crisis sooner than its neighbors			0
it is currently moving away from manufacturing as a base for its economy , and is now a world center of @entity76 banking and knowledge - based industries			0
in 1998 , @entity1 was fired from the cabinet amid police reports he was under investigation on charges of sodomy -- an illegal act in predominantly @entity18 @entity4			1
appearing in court with a black eye from a beating while in police custody - an injury that then inspector general of police @entity90 later admitted in a royal commission he had personally administered -- @entity1 pleaded not guilty			2
after a two - year trial , which also involved corruption charges , @entity1 was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in jail for sodomy and six years , served concurrently , for corruption			1
in december 2004 , @entity1 was cleared of the sodomy charges , and in 2006 he announced his bid to run for parliament in the 2008 elections after the expiration of a ban from public office related to his earlier conviction			1
in the 2008 elections , the opposition seriously dented the ruling @entity110 coalition 's majority , handing it one of its worst election results since independence in 1957			1
in what the @entity4 media had dubbed " @entity115 , " the opposition leader -- just months after the 2008 elections -- was again charged with sodomy on the basis of allegations from his aide @entity122 who claimed @entity1 had repeatedly sexually assaulted him			1
@entity1 dismissed the charges as a sham , saying they were concocted by the ruling coalition in an effort to discredit him			1
@entity1 has consistently claimed that the charges were trumped up and the last desperate act of a government fighting for its political survival			1
the government , for its part , has denied any involvement in the case against @entity1			0
" the fact that the same plot that was hatched in 1998 is being repeated reflects a certain bankruptcy and lack of creativity on their part , " @entity1 told @entity0 in 2010			0
" they must still believe some segment of the @entity18 electorate , who will likely determine the outcome of the next general election , will be alienated by these charges			0
i doubt that is the case			0
" after a nearly three - year trial , a @entity4 court monday found @entity1 not guilty of the charges against him after the judge said there were questions over whether dna evidence had been contaminated			2
information minister @entity158 hailed the verdict as a victory for @entity4 's judiciary , showing that it was free from government influence			0
with the government expected to call elections in the coming months , @entity1 said he was ready to start campaigning again and challenge the ruling coalition 's 50 - year hold on power			1
@entity1 has brought together a diverse group of opposition parties , including a conservative ethnic @entity172 @entity76 party , a secular party mainly representative of ethnic @entity176 and @entity177 minorities and his own multiracial party			2
at the heart of @entity4 's reform movement is the call for a multiracial alternative to the political status quo in the @entity185 nation			1
@entity4 's controversial policy of bumiputra -- a @entity172 term which means literally means " son of the soil " -- favors the ethnic @entity172 majority , providing them with preference in employment , business , education and housing			0
while proponents say the radical affirmative action campaign -- which was instituted in the early 1970s in response to anti-chinese riots in @entity4 in 1969 -- has lifted many urban @entity203 into the middle class , critics say that @entity176 , @entity177 and the indigenous @entity205 have been excluded from the political process			0
while problems with bumiputra were among the election issues , allegations of government cronyism and nepotism are now high on the list of voter concerns			0
dubbed the post-reformasi generation , educated young @entity4 in their 20s and 30s have been leaving the country to take up opportunities overseas			0
the brain drain is now a serious problem for the coalition government which has embarked on economic reforms , but is accused of doing little to reform the public service or education			0
according to @entity227 , the @entity4 program director for the @entity228 , @entity1 's acquittal will give a boost to the speed of reform			2
" @entity1 still represents the reform agenda , " he said			2
" the anti-corruption drives and drive towards good governance also illuminate a more welcoming view of as to how ethnicities should be treated in @entity4			0
" he said both the opposition and the government were pursuing reforms , swinging the attention of the reform movement towards problems of corruption rather than issues of ethnicity and race			1
one of the unintended consequences of the @entity1 case , he added , was that @entity4 's @entity250 - based legal system had emerged as an independent force in a political structure that critics charge has been compromised by decades of cronyism			1
" i would have to say that for once i am proud of a @entity4 institution , " @entity227 said			0
" the court has been strong enough to make a decision outside of politics and it needs to be applauded			0
" the court made its decision based solely on the facts of the case			0
today is a victory for the @entity4 judicial system and i hope that it heralds a bright new future , " he said .			0
