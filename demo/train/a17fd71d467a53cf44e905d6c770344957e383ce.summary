as he watched the presidential debates , @entity0 was irritated			1
but it was n't the candidates who were getting to him , it was hearing independent voters and undecided voters lumped into the same group			1
the 35 - year - old from @entity10 has registered as an independent since he was 18			1
he has voted for @entity12 and @entity13 over the years			1
the biggest misconception he hears is this : " if you 're registered as an independent , that must mean you 're undecided , " he said			1
" that 's just an opinion that happens to be very incorrect , " he said			2
" being independent has nothing to do with being undecided			2
" living in a two - party country can be tough for this group of voters , but there are more independents these days than ever			1
thirty - eight percent of @entity24 identify themselves as independents , according to a 2012 study on party identification by the @entity28			1
" the proportion of independents now equals its highest level in 70 years , " said a different @entity28 study from 2009			1
" owing to defections from the @entity13 , independents are more conservative on several key issues than in the past			1
" being called an undecided voter irks " independent thinker " @entity0 , as he already has made his decision			2
" in my case , it was already clear who i wanted to vote for , " he said			2
he cast an early ballot for president @entity44			2
@entity45 asked independents why they refuse to align with a party and heard from more than 100 people			1
a variety of themes arose , from not wanting to be labeled to disgust with political rancor to feeling that being independent is the " @entity52			1
" ' i do n't like being labeled ' @entity54 of @entity55 has consistently voted @entity56 but explains that he 's always identified himself as an independent			1
he 's never voted for a @entity13 because " i have n't agreed with any of the candidates ' values , but i reserve the right to vote for a @entity13 if their values match mine , " he said			2
growing up in an impoverished neighborhood in @entity64 where " violence was a problem , " @entity54 faced stereotypes that he has worked to overcome as a diversity consultant and motivational speaker			2
" i do n't like being labeled			1
i 've been labeled a lot of things in my life , " he said			1
@entity73 , a moderate independent , has a similar problem with siding with just one party			1
" it 's mostly the label , " she said			2
" if you say you 're a @entity56 , that must mean you are a left - wing liberal with no personal responsibility			2
if you say you are a @entity13 , you must be a right - wing millionaire who does n't care about others			2
" the @entity85 , @entity86 , voter feels a " lack of respect " toward independents like her and wishes there was more air time given to independent candidates			1
" i think it 's a travesty that the only ' limelight ' that exists is with either @entity13 or @entity12 when there are other options on the ballot with better opinions , much better track records , and a real solution , " she said			2
voting for the ' lesser of two evils ' @entity102 , 37 , identified more with the @entity12 when he was younger , but he started considering himself an independent in 2008			2
" the 2008 presidential race is when i really started getting involved in politics and trying to understand what 's going on in @entity55			2
it 's just unfortunate that there 's a lot of gridlock , and people are playing both sides , " he said			2
in the last few elections , he voted for @entity13 @entity114 , democrat @entity115 and , most recently , @entity44			0
while @entity102 's " progressive values " indicate he leans more to the left , @entity102 said he finds faults with both parties			0
he will be voting for @entity44 on @entity120 , but he 's not enthusiastic about it			0
" i 'm picking the lesser of two evils come this election			0
" it 's the ' @entity52 ' raised as a @entity127 democrat who switched to voting @entity13 in 1999 , @entity125 has voted for presidential candidates from both parties equally			0
she has identified as a " confused " independent for 10 years , she said			0
@entity13 presidential candidates @entity131 and @entity133 excited the right - leaning independent in the primaries , and she " flirted " with the idea of voting for @entity44 back in july			0
ultimately , she says , her vote will go to @entity138 next week			0
but the opinionated @entity139 does n't want to be tied down to a party			1
" i do n't want to be controlled , " she said			0
" i feel better as an independent			0
i feel like it 's a more honest position			0
" voting independent just feels " more @entity24 , " she said			1
" @entity24 was born on the theme of independence , and i find that being a committed independent is therefore truer to our national pride			1
" @entity147 , 66 , voted for @entity44 in 2008 and @entity114 in 2004			0
she agrees with @entity149 's line of thinking			0
" i do n't vote party lines because i do n't always agree with either party , @entity12 or @entity13 , " she said			1
" i 'm not liberal , i 'm not conservative			0
i 'm independent and can make my own decisions			0
" for the @entity156 resident , being an independent goes back to @entity24 's roots			1
" i am an independent voter because i believe in the @entity52 and how and why it was founded , " she said			0
raised @entity13 in @entity158 and now married to a @entity56 from @entity159 , @entity161 's flavor of independence stems from a similar tree			0
" i 've never been one for dogma and do n't feel like any ' side ' could represent my free will well enough to go straight ticket , " he said			0
the 44 - year - old has voted for @entity169 , @entity114 , @entity170 ( twice ) , @entity171 and @entity44			0
he said it 's " too restricting " to affiliate with one party			1
" in the spirit of independence by @entity24 who broke away from political dogma in the 1700s , i 'm proud to be unaffiliated			1
" lost between parties @entity181 confesses he feels " lost " politically			0
growing up in the @entity169 era , the 44 - year - old holds the @entity13 beliefs of smaller government and fiscal responsibility , he said			0
as a veteran , he supports having a strong military			0
but his concerns with the increasing @entity24 debt and @entity114 's presidency made him reconsider the way he voted , he said			1
" years ago , i began to feel disowned by my party , as this debt did n't start in ' 08 ( not that it is n't getting worse ) , " he wrote on @entity193			1
the " rise of the religious right " was the final straw			0
what 's a man without a party to do ? at first he thought about abstaining from voting			1
" i have n't heard a single candidate worth voting for , not in local , state , or federal elections , " he said			0
" they all seem to say whatever they think will get them votes without actually being nailed to anything			0
" the @entity211 , @entity212 , resident admits he was n't going to vote at all this year until controversy arose around @entity217 candidate @entity216 's comments on rape			0
" now i 'm going just to vote against him			0
how sad is that , " he asked			1
be ' free thinkers ' but @entity0 , the voter who emphasized the difference between independents and undecideds , asserts that voting as " free thinkers " is the answer			1
" everyone has the ability to think for themselves and question what other people are saying if they do n't think it 's right , " he said			0
" speak up ! "			0
