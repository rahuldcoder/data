-- have you ever found yourself standing hands akimbo in front of your suitcase in your hotel room thinking " i knew i 'd forget that , " or " why did i bring five pairs of shoes and just one pair of trousers ? " i 'm guilty on all counts			2
ever since , i 've developed a habit of packing three times , especially if i am flying long haul			2
i do n't like being rushed or packing last minute , so i always start three days before i travel			1
the first time , i allow myself to throw everything in i 'd ideally like to take in case of any change in weather or impromptu dinners or downtime ( my tennis racket unfortunately never makes the cut )			2
the second time , i pack with conviction and whittle it down , packing just for work -- how many interviews and locations i 'll film and whether or not i need different outfits for those shoots			2
all zipped up , i test the weight			0
if i can easily pick the suitcase up , say an inch off the ground , it 's about 19 kg. then i leave it for a day , unpack everything and pack one last time folding everything , using every inch of the suitcase as it fills up			1
chargers and adapters in shoes , that sort of thing ! if i 'm staying at a one or two - star hotel i 'll pack little bottles of shampoo and conditioner that i 've collected from a nicer hotel from previous trips ! when it comes to hand luggage , i 'm very particular			0
i pack my handbag in my suitcase and just travel with a waterproof shoulder bag in case it rains or in case i spill drinks everywhere			1
i pretty much travel with the same things on every trip			1
i stopped taking fruit with me ever since i forgot i had an apple in my bag when we arrived in @entity68 back in 2006			0
i was fined $ 60 because i had failed to declare it			0
it was the most expensive apple i 've ever bought -- sorry , that @entity71 ever bought			0
he was my hero but also the one who made fun of me the most about it ! anyway , now my travel essentials are : - note pad and pen - @entity78 and pashmina for any change in weather			1
- a second purse to hold foreign coins - @entity84 -- great for browsing newspapers and twitter feeds , storing photos			1
i still have n't fallen in love with e-books			0
i 'm currently reading what makes @entity92 by @entity93			0
- my yellow headphones -- always more comfortable wearing your own than airline headsets and music is a great escape for little windows of downtime			1
- digital camera -- i am an aviation enthusiast , planespotter , plane geek ! when i can , i prefer to fly during the day so that i can take photos from the window seat of the aircraft wing , winglets or engines during sunsets complete with the @entity110 or with cities down below			1
