@entity0 -- as the nation celebrated the start of another term for president @entity7 , @entity3 congressional leaders had a muted , bipartisan response to his second inaugural address			1
@entity7 's speech ties current issues to founding principles " today is a day for all of us in this country to come together , " @entity15 majority leader @entity14 , @entity16 , told @entity1 , when asked about the president 's speech			1
" it really does n't matter who you voted for , which side you 're on , " @entity14 added			2
" today is a day we can all come together			2
" @entity14 said the president 's speech addressed the issue of upward mobility , a topic of shared concern across party lines			1
transcript : read @entity7 's second inaugural address when asked about online reaction to the speech from republicans who felt it was too aggressive and too liberal , @entity14 again refused to engage in partisan terms			1
opinion roundup : @entity7 's ringing defense of liberalism " i think the president did a fine job certainly laying out what he would like to see happen as far as the future of the country , " the second - highest ranking @entity3 leader in the @entity15 said			1
" there are plenty of areas of disagreement but there are also some things that , fundamentally , we agree on -- and that is this country is one of opportunity , " he continued			0
@entity14 added that there were partisan differences over " the way we get there to help everybody			2
... hopefully , we can bridge those differences			0
" @entity14 's remarks echoed a sentiment shared by @entity66 minority leader @entity65 in a written statement issued as monday 's ceremony at the @entity69 was beginning to wrap up			1
" every four years on @entity72 , @entity71 shows the world that our major political parties can disagree with civility and mutual respect , " @entity70 wrote			0
the @entity66 's top @entity3 said @entity7 's second term represented a " fresh start " for addressing big challenges facing the country , including the issues of federal spending and debt			1
" republicans are eager to work with the president on achieving this common goal and we firmly believe that divided government provides the perfect opportunity to do so			0
together , there is much we can achieve			0
" @entity7 , near the end of his inaugural address on monday , made what appeared to be an oblique reference to the partisan battles between himself , the @entity3 - controlled @entity15 and the @entity66 -- where @entity95 have control but do not have a filibuster - proof majority			1
@entity98 faces own challenges as @entity7 's second term begins @entity15 @entity3 to vote on three - month extension of debt ceiling " being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life ; it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way , or follow the same precise path to happiness , " the president said to the nearly one million people gathered along the @entity104			1
" progress does not compel us to settle centuries - long debates about the role of government for all time -- but it does require us to act in our time			0
" for now decisions are upon us , and we can not afford delay			0
we can not mistake absolutism for principle , or substitute spectacle for politics , or treat name - calling as reasoned debate			1
we must act , knowing that our work will be imperfect			0
we must act , knowing that today 's victories will be only partial , and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years , and forty years , and four hundred years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare @entity135 hall			2
" @entity7 added that " the oath i have sworn before you today , like the one recited by others who serve in this @entity69 , was an oath to @entity140 and country , not party or faction -- and we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service			1
" asked about what occurred during monday 's lunch attended by the president and some members of @entity151 , @entity14 said , " it 's a very nice lunch			2
it is really a continuum of the spirit of the day where both sides come together			0
there 's bipartisan representation at the tables			0
there 's legislative branch , judicial branch , executive branch all sharing tables			0
and just nothing but good			0
hopefully that kind of cooperative spirit can continue			1
" @entity14 said part of the reason the luncheon ran long was because @entity7 " went to every table and shook every hand			2
" @entity1 's @entity172 asked @entity14 how long the bipartisan spirit and goodwill of @entity72 will linger			2
" we hope that this lasts , " @entity14 said , " and then that we can focus on solutions , bridging differences , setting aside differences and trying to focus on what we have in common as @entity71			0
