" the first time you do it you feel a bit nervous , but after two or three times , it becomes normal , like rugby or boxing or any sport			0
" @entity8 could easily be describing bungee jumping			0
but the 44 - year - old @entity10 is talking about something far more terrifying than bouncing on the end of a piece of elastic			1
every year from april to june , the @entity10 island of @entity15 hosts one of the most spectacular and death - defying cultural ceremonies ever conceived			1
known as the @entity20 , it sees men climb flimsy 100 - foot wooden towers and dive headfirst into empty space , with nothing to break their fall but vines tied their ankles			1
my journey to meet @entity8 and his fellow land jumpers begins on a stifling hot saturday morning as i board a 17 - seat @entity32 turboprop in the capital @entity34			1
the flight to @entity36 is n't for the easily rattled , though passengers are rewarded with epic views of @entity39 and @entity40 , active volcanoes on the island of @entity43			0
an hour later , the pilot touches down at @entity45 , a small runway squeezed between the jungle - clad mountains and volcanic beaches of @entity15 's west coast			1
ours is the first of the day 's five planes , all bringing in tourists to land at what 's more of a concrete bunker than an airport			1
organizers say a maximum of 50 tourists are allowed to attend the weekly ceremony to prevent over-commercialization			0
a portion of every ticket helps pay for children 's school fees and church programs			2
dysfunctional marriage ironically , @entity69 missionaries banned land diving on @entity71 in the early 20th century , but the priests never reached the rugged southeast corner of the island , where the ritual was passed on to successive generations			1
the ritual is said to have its roots in a legend about a dysfunctional marriage			0
so the story goes , a woman decided to flee into the jungle to escape daily confrontations with her spouse			0
hotly pursued by her husband , she ran up a tree then tied a vine around her ankle and jumped from the top , landing safely			0
the husband followed suit but without the aid of the vine he hit the ground with a fatal splat			2
inspired by the woman 's act of defiance , the women of @entity71 began land diving for fun			1
but uneasy with seeing the women dangling from trees in compromising positions , the island 's men called an end to their fun and stole the activity for themselves			2
over time , land diving moved from trees to purpose - built towers			1
it 's also been transformed into a ritual rife with religious symbolism -- the success of the all - important yam harvest is said to depend on the courage of the previous year 's divers			1
after the last plane touches down , we 're shepherded to a clearing in the jungle where the impressive tower known as a " @entity123 " stands upon a treeless slope			0
held together by vines without a single nail or screw , this outwardly phallic shrine takes 30 men up to a month to build			2
deadly mistakes at its center is a lopped tree surrounded by a crisscross of pole scaffolding lashed together and anchored into the earth by vines			2
protruding from its face are a dozen diving planks , the lowest of which is for boys who start diving from the age of five			2
the highest is reserved for the most accomplished , with a successful jump -- one that does n't cripple or kill the diver -- delivering wads of social capital			0
despite its primitive appearance , the @entity123 is a marvel of intelligent design			0
the diving boards are designed to snap and hinge downward to absorb much of the divers ' g - force , the wood is freshly cut to ensure strength and vines are carefully tailored to each diver 's weight and height			1
diving is only permitted in the two months following the wet season to ensure the vines contain the water that lends them elasticity and strength			1
adherence to religious customs is also considered essential to a diver 's safety			2
while the tower is being constructed , divers live together in men - only huts and avoid contact with women -- a ritual said to clarify their minds			1
as belief in sorcery is widespread in @entity10 , divers are also prohibited from asking witchdoctors to supply them " love potions " during this period			1
on a few occasions when the rules have been bent , it has cost lives			0
when @entity191 's @entity190 visited @entity15 in february 1974 , a diver died when his vine snapped during an out - of - season @entity20 held in her honor			1
in 2008 , @entity10 cameraman @entity194 was killed when a poorly constructed tower collapsed under his weight during a @entity197 that some said had been held too close to the yam harvest			1
breaking wood the moment the @entity20 begins , it becomes apparent why people come from all corners of the world to see it			0
on a terrace cut into the hill behind the tower , a troupe of about 100 men and boys wearing only penis sheaths begin chanting in @entity213 , the language of @entity15			2
without warning they break into a dance , stomping their feet intently into the ground as women in grass skirts emerge from the trees , adding their voices to the melee			0
one of the dancing men emerges from the group , scampers up the tower and finds his way to the lowest diving board			0
minutes pass as the frayed ends of two vines are tied around the volunteer 's ankles			1
below , the chanting and dancing intensifies			0
once the vines are secured , the diver spreads his arms wide and calls out for emotional support from the dancers			0
the crowd 's yelps and whistles reach fever pitch , the diver crosses his arms against his chest and makes an incredible leap of faith , trying to put as much distance between himself and the sharp edges of the tower			2
@entity253 than bungee when the vines go taut , the sound of breaking wood cracks through the clearing , as the plank gives way			0
instead of bouncing in the air like a bungee jumper , the diver plummets to the ground , skimming his chest on earth that has been heavily tilled to absorb impact			0
assistants rush in , pull the diver to his feet and confirm he 's in one piece			0
the crowd roars with approval			0
happily , all 12 land divers emerge unscathed on this day -- an unusually good safety record			2
but the divers remain well aware of the risks			0
among them , 33 - year - old @entity278 scornfully dismisses comparisons with thrill seekers who use elastic ropes			2
" @entity284 is not so brave , " he says			0
few who have seen the @entity10 land divers in action would argue			1
getting there : @entity289 ( +678 5544 206 ) offers day tours to see the land divers of @entity71 every saturday in april , may and june for 44,000 vatu ( $ 426 )			1
