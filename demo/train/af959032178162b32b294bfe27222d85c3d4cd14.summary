-- @entity1 , who is said to be a candidate for @entity4 's interim prime minister following a military coup , has been regarded as an outsider in his native land because of his international achievements as a diplomat and co-winner of the @entity11			1
an above - the - fray image hurt him when he unsuccessfully ran for president last year in the country 's first democratic elections following the 2011 ouster of despotic president @entity17			1
at the time , @entity1 was a @entity18 - come - lately to the long grind of ground - level politics			2
as if to prove naysayers wrong , @entity1 stayed in the fight for @entity4 's post-revolution government , and he endured as a reformer , becoming an opposition leader			1
@entity1 : fast facts now @entity1 could possibly land deep inside @entity4 's power structure , in the nation 's capital where he was born 71 years ago			1
his political party 's claim saturday -- that @entity1 was chosen to become interim prime minister -- was contradicted later in the day by a spokesman for interim president @entity35 , who said a decision had yet to be made			1
" i hope i 'll be the @entity40 © minence grise , " @entity1 told @entity0 this week , with a measure of laughter			2
" i 'm getting on with the years ... and i think i 'll be much more effective			0
" as a lawyer i want always to be within the bounds of constitutional legality but ... we still are between a rock and hard place , " he continued			0
" either you risk a civil war -- and we have quite a few of them around us -- or , as i said , take extra-constitutional measures to ensure that we get the country together			0
" like his father , @entity1 studied law , earning a bachelor 's degree at @entity56			2
he then left the country , traveling as a diplomat			0
by 1974 , he earned a doctorate in international law from @entity61 , and a decade later , he joined the @entity62 -- which proved to be a brilliant career move because it eventually led him and the agency to share the @entity11 in 2005			2
@entity1 served as chief of the atomic agency for 12 years			1
he and the agency won the honor for their work to curb nuclear proliferation			0
as director general of the @entity62 , he even challenged president @entity74 's claims that @entity75 had a nuclear weapons program before @entity74 ordered a coalition - supported invasion of @entity75 in early 2003			1
with those international laurels , @entity1 was among those who successfully pushed for the ouster of @entity17 after 30 years as president			1
still , @entity1 was considered an above - it - all technocrat who was viewed as an unlikely presidential candidate , though he did join @entity86 protests in @entity4 despite receiving death threats			1
he had no official protection during his participation in those protests			0
@entity1 was reportedly placed under house arrest by @entity4 authorities , but he defied a government curfew and went to @entity94 's @entity93 to join protests in january 2011			1
the next month , @entity17 stepped down			0
in march 2011 , @entity1 announced he was running for president , and 10 days later , thugs attacked his car , keeping him from voting in a constitutional referendum			1
the next month , he returned to his first love -- diplomacy and atomic weapons -- and published a book , " the age of deception : @entity104 in @entity105			0
" the publisher 's blurb states that " @entity1 takes us inside the nuclear fray , from behind - the - scenes exchanges in @entity110 and @entity111 to the streets of @entity113 and the trail of @entity116 nuclear smugglers			2
he decries an us - versus - them approach and insists on the necessity of relentless diplomacy			0
" if that was a campaign strategy , it did n't work : in january 2012 , he quit the presidential race			0
in an example of how politics can make for strange bedfellows , @entity1 then criticized the interim military government -- the same military that has now put him in power -- for failing to bring about " a real democratic system			0
" it 's clear now , however , that @entity1 has the attention of @entity4 's generals .			0

@entity1 was born in @entity94 71 years ago , but has been viewed as an outsider
he traveled as a diplomat and chief of @entity62
he unsuccessfully ran last year for president in first elections since revolution
he endured , however , as an opposition leader
