@entity0 -- @entity2 , one of the world 's iconic sports and entertainment arenas , has been given a decade to relocate after a vote by the @entity8 on wednesday amid efforts to renovate the equally well - known @entity10 that sits below it			1
the council voted to approve a " special permit " that will allow the arena to operate for 10 years while its management seeks to relocate , according to a news release			1
the 47 - 1 vote comes after years of advocacy from city officials and independent groups who have sought to renovate and expand the bustling @entity10			1
@entity2 's 50 - year land - use permit expired in january			0
the original @entity10 , which featured @entity23 columns , vast hallways and glass ceilings , was demolished in 1963 to make way for the construction of the current @entity2 , which opened in 1968			1
" the approval of this permit offers us a great opportunity to reimagine and redevelop @entity10 as a world - class transportation destination and allow time to relocate @entity2 to a new and improved home , " @entity28 and mayoral candidate @entity29 said in a statement			2
watch : @entity0 like you 've never seen it in june , @entity39 called for the creation of a " @entity41 for a 21st century @entity10 , " with the goal of helping to find a new @entity44 home for the arena and to renovate @entity10			1
@entity0 mayor @entity46 had hoped for a 15 - year permit , according to @entity48 , spokeswoman for the mayor			0
if @entity2 does not find a new location , it will have to reapply for a permit once it expires			0
@entity10 accommodates hundreds of thousands travelers per day , and the @entity8 says the @entity2 's placement above it is an " intractable problem			2
" " imagine 220 mph bullet trains that sweep you to @entity58 or @entity59 in 90 minutes or less			0
these plans are on the table , but they can only be realized with a modern , renovated @entity10 , " said @entity60 and city comptroller candidate @entity61			0
" that is not possible as long as the @entity2 sits squarely on top of the nation 's busiest rail transit hub			2
" the arena 's management did not go into the details of the vote , stating rather that it looks forward to its reopening this fall after a " three year , nearly billion dollar " renovation , according to @entity75 , spokeswoman for @entity2			2
@entity2 , home to the @entity77 and @entity78 , first opened its doors in 1879 but has since moved to several locations throughout the city , according to its website			1
