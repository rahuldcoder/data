@entity0 how we view robots -- and the inevitable robotics revolution that we 've been promised for so long -- depends largely on our background			1
for me , as an @entity7 , robots will be inherently linked with @entity9 as a kid , but later with the unstoppable android that was the @entity12			0
so , while i can dream of a cute , trashcan - sized companion , the fantasy is also coupled with an inherent fear that it may one day rise up and attempt to exterminate me			0
for many @entity18 people , robots were a staple of pop culture growing up			1
from @entity22 's @entity21 ( known here by his original name , which translates as @entity21 ) in the 1950s and 60s , to the towering , martial robots of the " @entity27 " and " evangelion " universes , to name but a few , robots have long held a special place in the collective imagination			1
robot pioneers so it really is no surprise that the country is on the leading edge of robot technology , and a visit to the @entity40 of @entity41 , known as @entity42 ( @entity43 ) in @entity0 really drives home the point			1
here , visitors can interact with @entity46 , the @entity48 - developed android that can run , perform tasks , and interact with people			0
@entity48 first unveiled @entity46 a decade ago , and even today it remains a futuristic vision of what robotics may one day hope to achieve on a consumer scale			0
@entity42 also houses other , interactive automatons that show glimpses of what life might be like in 15 , 20 , or 30 years			0
there 's @entity61 , who looks like a young @entity18 woman with silicone skin , flowing hair , and blinking eyes			1
and then there 's @entity68 , an android newscaster that reads headlines to museum visitors , and @entity72 , a creepy - looking communication device that allows you to " speak " to friends or loved ones who are far away -- and feel as if you are sitting with them			2
you can hold and hug the @entity72 , and it hugs you back with its little stubs for arms			0
while giant fighting space robots may be a while off -- although engineers are reportedly planning a moving , 60 ft tall @entity27 -- @entity18 is betting big that robots will have a greater place in our lives in the years to come			1
help at home from housework helpers which can ease the burden of a range of daily chores -- like @entity92 , the multipurpose home care droid currently under development at @entity0 's @entity95			1
with a humanoid upper body and wheeled base , it boasts a dexterity and mobility that would be helpful in any number of tasks , including assisting the elderly			0
@entity104 and his team have the vision of putting robots in everyone 's homes			2
he tells me it will be decades before robots are mass - produced the way cars are today , but what is being developed today could well become commonplace in the future			2
twenty - one is a great example of how @entity18 researchers are thinking of helping the country 's aging population			1
@entity122 -- humanoid robots -- may also one day soon act as companions and helpers to the elderly as @entity18 looks at its current demographic crisis and uses technology in inventive ways to combat a shrinking , aging population			2
nursing homes could also benefit from " wearable , " exoskeleton robots , like @entity136 's @entity135 - 5 , that can assist with mobility			2
thanks to technological advances , including those in " emotion recognition functions , " robots are becoming a lot more sympathetic and " human " for want of a better term , and thus accepted			0
last month , @entity18 telecom company @entity146 showcased @entity147 , " the first robot to read human emotions , " according to the company 's ceo , @entity148			2
elsewhere , national emergencies like the meltdown at the @entity155 reactor have driven home the point that there remain myriad situations for which we soft , fragile humans are ill - equipped			0
economic boon @entity18 's robot revolution is not only underway , but has the backing of the country 's government , which sees it as a potential antidote to decades of sluggish gdp growth			1
last month , @entity18 's prime minister @entity169 said that he is bullish about the future of robotics , after photo ops at a @entity174 nursing home and a @entity0 robotics factory			1
he 's expressed a desire to " set up a council on making a robotic revolution a reality in order to aid @entity18 's growth , " and set a benchmark of tripling the robot market to Â¥ 2.4 trillion ( $ 24 billion )			1
@entity169 also declared his hope that there will be a high profile " robot olympics " in 2020 , a companion piece to the human version , which will be held in @entity0 that year			0
the @entity190 ( as they should clearly be called ) will act as a showcase for advancement in the fields of robotics and engineering			0
" in 2020 , i would like to gather all of the world 's robots and aim to hold an @entity200 where they compete in technical skills , " mr @entity169 told @entity197 agency			0
" we want to make robots a major pillar of our economic growth strategy			2
" already ingrained in the country 's cultural conciousness , the robots of today will hopefully encourage and inspire the next generation of designers , programmers and engineers , in the way that i was inspired by @entity9 , and countless @entity18 youths , by their rich robot anime and manga culture			1
this robot valet will park your car @entity222 , the emotional robot @entity224 in @entity225 contributed to this report			0

@entity18 has long *portrayed* robots in popular culture , *paving* the way for the country 's robotic **industry**
interactive robots at @entity0 *exhibition* give visitors a *firsthand* look at some *innovative* examples
@entity18 's prime minister hopes the robotics **industry** will be a major economic contributor in the future
