-- @entity1 does n't like losing -- and it 's a trait that the tennis star 's nearest and dearest also possess			1
born into a sports - mad family , the @entity6 star had to battle for supremacy within the competitive environment of her childhood home in @entity12 , long before she had designs of making tennis her career			1
both her father @entity16 and older brother @entity17 were professional footballers			2
mother @entity19 played volleyball for @entity21 , where both parents were born -- and lived until @entity16 joined a @entity6 club			2
" @entity26 was in my genes , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity25 program			1
" but nobody would play me because they said i was n't good enough -- they always put me in the umpire 's chair ! " but i was stubborn and started to practice playing tennis every day by hitting balls against a wall			1
i wanted to beat my parents first , then my brother			2
that was the ultimate goal , to beat my brother , and when it happened i was so happy ! " @entity16 has been @entity1 's coach for most of her career , but she has also started working with @entity42 @entity41			1
" my dad is still on court every day as well			0
i think it 's important for me to stick to the same team , " she said			0
" i 've always gotten someone from the outside helping me with small details , and yeah -- i am thinking that can help			0
" @entity1 's recent @entity52 quarterfinal defeat to defending champion @entity53 will have hurt her enormously , not least because it meant she also lost the world number one ranking she had held for 67 consecutive weeks			1
critics bemoan the fact that @entity1 has risen so high before earning a first grand slam title , but she has already won 18 @entity60 tournaments and earned nearly $ 12 million in career prize money			1
add to that her celebrity boyfriend -- top golfer @entity62 , who also hates losing -- and @entity1 is fast becoming a darling of the tabloid press			1
the 21 - year - old has no problems with the attention she receives and relishes being a role model to children , just like @entity71 and @entity72 were when she was an adoring young fan			1
" on the practice courts , i see the small girls wearing @entity76 outfits & @entity78 rackets			0
it 's really nice to see , " said @entity1 , referring to the clothes line she wears and the equipment she endorses			1
" i remember myself when i was a little girl , looking up to @entity71			0
i wanted to play like her and have the same clothes as her			0
" i also remember when @entity72 came to @entity85 for an exhibition			1
i was 12 at the time			2
i went down to the court and asked her if she would play one point with me			0
" she did and i never forget that			0
i think it 's also right to give something back to the people who follow you			0
" @entity1 also gives something back to her fans via the @entity98			1
like @entity62 , she is an avid user of social networking site @entity99 and has accumulated over 270,000 followers			1
@entity62 has a remarkable 800,000 followers , meaning over one million people get to know the couple 's inner thoughts and feelings every day			2
" i like @entity99 a lot , " said @entity1			1
" it is a great way to get the fans knowing another side of you			0
" i also think it is a good way to put things straight that are maybe misrepresented in the media			2
i have fun with it and give @entity62 a hard time on it ! " ( @entity121 tennis player ) @entity122 also gets involved on @entity99			1
i hit two aces against him in the @entity124 and teased him about it on @entity99			2
" but it is @entity1 's achievements on the court which still create the biggest news , not all of it positive			2
however , she has a relaxed attitude to her " slam drought			0
" " my dream as a little girl was to be world number one and to win grand slams			1
i 've finished as number one two years in a row and a slam is obviously my next goal , " she said			2
" it 's just about peaking at the right time and playing well for two weeks			0
i 've reached the finals and semifinals before , so i know i can do it			0
everything has just gone so fast because i am still only 21 but at the same time i feel like i have been on the @entity60 for a while			0
she added : " @entity149 players are starting to come up as well and they will see me as one of the older , experienced ones			0
" i just have to get used to that			0
i used to always be the young one playing without pressure , but i am just happy to be where i am and enjoying my time			0
