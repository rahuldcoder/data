a nationwide shortage of a commonly used imported drug used in capital punishment has prompted 15 states on monday to urge the @entity4 to intervene			1
led by @entity7 officials , the move comes as the 33 states with the death penalty -- all of whom use lethal injection as the primary execution method -- struggle to preserve existing stock or search for legally acceptable chemical alternatives			1
a federal judge in march had blocked the importation of thiopental into states like @entity20 , @entity21 , and @entity22 saying it was a " misbranded drug and an unapproved drug			1
" judge @entity25 in @entity26 ordered state corrections departments to return suspected foreign - made thiopental to the @entity29			1
the states called that a " flawed decision " and now want the @entity29 to appeal that judge 's decision , saying upcoming executions are being undermined			1
attorneys general @entity35 in @entity7 and @entity36 in @entity37 are leading the legal effort			0
" at the very core of the states ' police powers are their powers to enact laws to protect their citizens against violent crimes			0
as state attorneys general , we are tasked with enforcing those laws , including in instances where capital punishment is authorized for the most heinous of crimes , " according to attorneys general from the 15 states			0
states argued the federal agency had routinely released the imported drug for executions , a practice suspended after the judge 's ruling			1
" if the ( court ) decision is not overturned , we as state attorneys general will be forced to take actions to ensure execution by lethal injection remains a viable option			1
" this comes after @entity70 officials disclosed monday they only have enough drugs on hand for 23 more executions			1
the next scheduled execution in the @entity75 is @entity76 in @entity70 on june 6			1
@entity77 earlier this month announced new protocols , and will use an entirely new drug			2
@entity80 is a surgical anesthetic that in large doses can be administered fatally , but has never been used in the @entity75 to put prisoners to death			2
officials in @entity86 , @entity70 and other states last year cited a nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental in their decisions to separately use pentobarbital , a barbiturate that has alternately been used to put animals to sleep			1
some states use a single execution drug , others rely on a three - drug mixture or cocktail			2
@entity100 has become the new legal flashpoint over capital punishment			0
it was used in a @entity75 execution for the first time in december 2010 , when it was administered as the first ingredient in a three - drug cocktail used in a lethal injection given to an @entity7 inmate			1
it also has limited @entity29 approval in smaller doses for humans as a mild anesthetic and to treat some seizures			0
many physicians say they no longer administer it to people for medical purposes			0
the second drug in the three - drug cocktail -- pancuronium bromide -- paralyzes all muscle movement			2
the third drug , potassium chloride , induces cardiac arrest and death			2
in 2009 , @entity86 became the first state to perform an execution with a single drug , using a higher concentration of sodium thiopental			2
there were no reported complications and its use encouraged other states to follow suit			0
the nation 's only manufacturer of sodium thiopental since announced it was stopping production			0
many capital punishment opponents claim sodium thiopental , which renders the prisoner unconscious , can wear off too quickly , and that some prisoners would actually be awake and able to feel pain as the procedure continued			0
the @entity149 manufacturers of both pentobarbital and sodium thiopental have opposed using their products for executions in the @entity75			1
@entity100 is widely available and has been used for physician - assisted suicide , including in @entity154 , where the practice is legal in limited circumstances			0
nationwide , death penalty use continues to decline			0
@entity158 recently became the latest state to ban capital punishment , although the 11 people on death row will remain there			0
only 43 people were executed in the @entity75 in 2011 , down three from the previous year , and a 56 % decline from 13 years ago , when nearly 100 people were put to death			2
eighteen have been executed so far in 2012 .			0
