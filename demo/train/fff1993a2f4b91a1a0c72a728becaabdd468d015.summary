-- @entity2 secretary of state @entity1 will not use the term war to describe @entity5 's impending military action against the jihadist group @entity6 in @entity7 and @entity8 , but others in the @entity11 administration are n't shying away from the word			1
what 's in a name ? on wednesday night , the war - stopping , @entity16 - winning president used a nationally televised address to announce a plan to " dismantle and ultimately destroy " the @entity21 jihadists who have taunted @entity2 by beheading two captive @entity2 journalists			1
" we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country , wherever they are , " he said			0
" that means i will not hesitate to take action against @entity28 in @entity7 , as well as @entity8			0
" the administration , of course , prefers the term @entity28 while many others go with @entity6 , but that 's another story			1
the seeds of uncertainly over what to call the @entity6 - @entity28 campaign were planted by @entity1 on thursday , who told @entity0 in an interview that the @entity2 was not at war with @entity6 , saying the administration 's strategy includes " many different things that one does n't think of normally in context of war			1
" " what we are doing is engaging in a very significant counterterrorism operation , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47			1
" it 's going to go on for some period of time			0
if somebody wants to think about it as being a war with @entity28 , they can do so , but the fact is it 's a major counterterrorism operation that will have many different moving parts			2
" on thursday , deputy @entity59 spokeswoman @entity58 sought to clarify the lexicon of the @entity63 campaign			1
" well , i know there has been a lot of questions about what words we use but as the president said the other night this is a very different campaign from the @entity71 , the last time we used that term , " she said			0
" it will not involve @entity2 combat troops fighting on foreign soil			1
we utilize our air superiority and support for partner forces on the ground			0
" instead , she calls the action " a steady , relentless counterterrorism campaign to take out @entity28 wherever they exist			0
" " this is not also @entity2 's war with @entity28 , " she added			1
" the world is joining us in the fight because of the threat they pose to countries in the regions			0
so we are at war with @entity28 in the same way we are at war with @entity95 and its affiliates around the world			0
" @entity99 press secretary @entity98 on friday said it was @entity28 that had " indicated that they are ready to go to war against the world and this president , as is expected of @entity2 presidents , is stepping up to lead an international coalition to confront that threat			1
" he added , " ultimately , this international coalition will be responsible for degrading and destroying @entity28			0
so i think what you can conclude from this is the @entity2 is at war with @entity28 the same way that we are at war with @entity95 and @entity95 affiliates all around the globe			2
" the @entity115 had a similar take			0
the @entity2 is at war with @entity28 " in the same way we 're at war and continue to be at war with @entity95 and its affiliates , " press secretary rear adm. @entity117 said			2
" there 's not going to be a purely military solution to the threat that @entity28 poses in the region , specifically inside @entity8 , " @entity117 said			2
" there 's not going to be a military solution here			2

@entity1 will not use the term war to describe @entity5 's impending military action
