-- summer is the best time for outdoor musical festivals and blasting music with all the windows open			1
we 've done the legwork for you , and compiled what should be some of the best albums of the season , and the most tent - worthy festivals , organized by region			1
find the ear candy that suits your taste best , and get busy listening : albums @entity18 , " ... like @entity19 , " due june 4 the band 's sixth album , a follow - up to " @entity23 , " welcomes founding bassist @entity24 back into the band , and includes guest spots by @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , among others			1
it 's one of the first meaty rock records of the summer and can be heard here			2
the @entity36 , " the @entity37 , " due june 11 an anecdote to the oh - so - earnest music out there , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 are back with the hilarity , with help from friends @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and more			1
" @entity58 " is a twisted update of " @entity55 , " while " @entity37 " takes bromance to its logical conclusion			2
@entity59 , " @entity60 , " due june 18 his follow - up to " @entity71 " is supposed to be a game - changer -- and we hope that does n't mean too many @entity66 songs such as " @entity67 , " which he played at the @entity68 and the @entity70 upfront			2
a sneak peek of tracks " @entity74 " and " @entity75 " on " @entity76 " suggest that he 's been listening to a lot of @entity78 , while his collaborators include @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , members of @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			2
potential tracks " @entity88 " and " i am not a celebrity " also suggest ' @entity59 is n't leaving his ego at the door			0
the 20 best summer 2013 movies @entity94 , " @entity95 , " due june 18 now that multi-instrumentalist @entity99 's left to go compose elsewhere , the @entity98 band 's sound has transformed from ambient music / dream - rock to something harder and darker , as indicated by first - released tracks " @entity103 " and " @entity104 , " which venture further into prog - metal			1
do n't worry , the gorgeous falsettos are still intact			0
@entity108 , " @entity108 , " june tba the duo 's synth - heavy follow - up to " congratulations " features influences by @entity111 and house music and was recorded with longtime @entity114 producer @entity113 , which only can mean one thing -- expect it to be trippy			1
the first sneak peek track , " @entity120 , " was released on cassette for @entity122 last month			0
the album is expected to include a version of @entity126 's garage rocker " @entity127 " as well as new track " @entity108			2
" what 's new this summer on tv ? @entity132 , " @entity131 , " july tba for the 20th anniversary of " enter the @entity132 ( 36 @entity136 ) , " the @entity134 hip - hop group has a new and possibly final album , named after their 1997 track , " @entity131			1
" @entity140 told the @entity141 that the group has one last mission : " we need to , one time , completely , efficiently , properly represent our brand , " while @entity145 told the @entity146 , " we got verses and s --- , but you got ta make sure it 's right			0
@entity154 , " @entity153 , " summer @entity155 the full album was supposed to be out in april , but the @entity158 rapper gave us a taste of her new music ( outside of last year 's " @entity162 " ) during @entity163 for the runway show of the @entity166 brand @entity167			2
advance word on " @entity153 " was that it was more upbeat than usual ( " @entity174 " ) , but leaked track " @entity171 " is a bit darker : " my existence is militant			0
" @entity154 has said on @entity175 that there are " no collabs " on this album , although she worked with producers @entity178 and @entity179 , whose @entity180 told @entity181 the album has " a lot more bounce to it			0
" @entity188 , " mrs. @entity189 , " summer @entity155 @entity188 has treated us to a few tracks so far from her fifth studio album -- " @entity193 , " " @entity193 , " " @entity190 " -- so we know she 's working on it			1
the only question is how much remains to be done before release , since she 's currently on tour			0
speaking of which ... festivals sure , most of your favorite artists are on tour this summer -- from @entity188 to @entity204 and @entity52 to @entity205 -- but you 'll get more bang for your buck if you check out one of the many music festivals around the country			1
you might even discover a new fave artist while you 're there : @entity213 if you 're on the @entity214 ( or thereabouts ) , you might want to go to @entity216 in @entity217 august 31 - september 2 ( @entity218 )			1
the lineup at @entity216 includes fun. , @entity221 , @entity108 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225			1
@entity221 plans to play the 2003 album " transatlanticism " in its entirety			0
( you know , the one from which @entity231 had the poster on his wall in " @entity235 " ) also , the @entity229 will host an electronic dance music stage			2
those farther south on the coast might want to hit up @entity240 in @entity241 august 9 - 11 which will include @entity242 , @entity245 , @entity244 and @entity243			0
@entity246 if you 're in the @entity246 ( or thereabouts ) , @entity249 in @entity251 's @entity250 should be your destination august 2 - 4			0
the lineup includes @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity18 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262 , plus plenty more			0
granted , it 's not the same as when @entity249 actually toured the country , but this is great for one - stop shopping to fulfill your summer music needs			2
also in the @entity246 , @entity268 in @entity269 , @entity270 , june 28 - 29 -- with @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 and the @entity245			0
@entity275 folks on the @entity275 should try their luck at the governor 's ball in @entity280 june 7 - 9 , which @entity59 is headlining ( @entity281 are slated to make an appearance , but you never know with @entity284 )			0
also on the bill are the @entity286 , @entity271 and @entity287			0
a little farther away from the @entity288 is the sure - to - be - eventful @entity289 on june 2 in @entity290 , @entity291 , which includes more @entity271 , plus a $ @entity292 , @entity132 , @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295			1
the @entity296 in @entity297 , @entity298 , june 21 - 23 offers the @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity242 and @entity244 , while the @entity302 fest in @entity303 august 31 - september 1 has @entity188 leading a lineup curated by her hubby @entity204 : @entity306 , @entity254 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity260 , @entity18 and @entity310			1
( if @entity204 's doc " @entity312 " is released first , watch it to get amped )			0
the @entity313 down @entity313 , big festivals await			1
@entity315 in @entity316 , @entity317 , june 13 - 16 has an eclectic lineup this year , with seasoned vets ( @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 ) facing off against typical festival fare ( @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity286 ) and some beyond the norm choices ( @entity327 ¶ rk , @entity328 , @entity132 )			1
and then there 's the comedy lineup , featuring @entity331 ( in case you did n't get enough of him in the new season of " @entity335 " ) , @entity336 ( ditto for " @entity338 " ) , and @entity339 , who will probably work blue			0
meanwhile , the @entity340 in @entity341 july 4 weekend will cool off with @entity342 , @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 and who else -- @entity188			1
