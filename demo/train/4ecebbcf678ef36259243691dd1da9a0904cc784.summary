-- for discerning clubbers around the world the hottest sound in dance music right now is coming not from @entity5 or @entity6 , but from the townships of @entity8 , @entity9			1
@entity14 's " @entity13 " was the first @entity11 track to receive international attention			2
@entity14 's " @entity13 " became the surprise global club anthem of last year , an instant favorite on dance floors everywhere , with its ear - popping mix of incessant , driving snare drums and retro electronic noises			2
its distinctive sound is part of a larger scene known as @entity11 that comes straight from the townships of @entity8			1
but its improbable journey to glitzy superclubs around the world may never have happened without the help of @entity9 's taxi drivers			1
@entity9 has long been a voracious consumer of imported @entity32 @entity11 music , but over the last few years a small group of producers in @entity8 have begun experimenting with their own sound , more representative of the music of the townships they live in			1
they came up with a style that mixes the raw beats of the @entity9 hip - hop style called @entity44 with @entity11 music 's tempos and electronic sounds			1
but the problem for the @entity50 producers was getting their music heard			0
neither the radio stations nor the big record labels in @entity9 were interested in their rough - and - ready sound -- so the producers decided to go directly to the public			2
@entity57 writes for @entity58 and works for @entity14 's record label , @entity59			0
" in @entity9 , the easiest way to the people is through the taxis , " he told @entity0			2
@entity9 taxis are actually small mini buses and are by far the most popular mode of public transport in a country where car ownership is limited			0
a @entity70 study estimates that between five and 10 million @entity9 use taxis every day			0
the @entity11 pioneers began to give cds of their tracks to taxi drivers			1
the drivers played the cds to a captive audience of commuters and the response was incredible			2
passengers wanted to know where they could buy the tracks they were hearing , and with no record stores stocking the music , taxi drivers began selling cds directly from taxi ranks and roadside stalls			1
do you think @entity11 is the next big thing in dance music ? sound off below			1
@entity57 said that even without radio play the township sound began outselling imported dance music and the record labels began to take notice			2
" these people created a demand , " he said			0
" then @entity14 's ' @entity13 ' blew up on the streets and everything went crazy			0
" but the @entity50 producers are n't the only ones to realize the power of taxi drivers when it comes to promoting a cause			2
@entity8 - based @entity107 spreads the word of @entity109 by giving taxi drivers cds that mix music with messages from the @entity113			1
in the run up to the recent general election , @entity9 opposition party the @entity114 ( @entity114 ) gave taxi drivers cds featuring specially recorded songs that promoted the party message			1
the idea was the brainchild of @entity124 , of the @entity125			0
he told @entity0 that giving the cds to taxi drivers to play in their vehicles was a way of reaching as many people as possible , and that while there was no way of quantifying its effectiveness , he believed that the party had received extra votes because of the cd			1
once @entity8 's taxi drivers had generated a buzz about " @entity13 , " @entity59 stepped in , signing @entity14			1
the track got a low - budget video of township dancers demonstrating their best moves while @entity144 at the roadside			0
the video was posted to @entity147 , where it was spotted by @entity150 labels @entity151 and @entity152			0
the result was a worldwide release , big - name remixes and a global club sensation			0
@entity14 's success has created an international buzz about the @entity50 sound			0
producers like @entity161 are starting to make waves , @entity166 's " @entity165 " has just been released by @entity150 dance label @entity163 and @entity14 is currently scheduled for a @entity32 tour , but has had to cancel because of illness			0
@entity57 told @entity0 , " by combining the electronic sound from @entity170 with the hard drum and the raw snare they 've created something totally unique			0
you ca n't find it anywhere in the world -- only in @entity9			0
" only in @entity9 -- and thanks to @entity8 's taxi drivers , in clued - up nightclubs around the world .			1
