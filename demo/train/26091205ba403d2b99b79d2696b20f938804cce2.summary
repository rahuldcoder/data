it is one of the most enduring mysteries of @entity3 , and for the families , it 's a reason for hope			1
why did n't @entity3 's emergency beacon work ? why did n't the beacon send a distress signal to satellites overhead ? and the clincher : why , if the beacon is designed to activate on impact , should we believe there was an impact ? could the plane have landed intact ? could the 239 passengers and crew still be alive ? the issue resonates with some family members looking for hope where little exists			1
of the 26 questions families recently presented to the @entity25 government , 12 addressed the beacon			1
adding to the mystery : hijackers or renegade pilots can not disable some of the emergency beacons , namely , the ones attached to the plane 's airframe			1
they are powered by batteries and inaccessible to the crew			2
so by all accounts , the attached beacon on flight 370 should have activated if the plane crashed			2
but experts consulted by @entity41 say there are numerous reasons why a beacon could fail in an ocean crash			2
the beacon itself could be damaged by the impact , or its antenna could be sheared from the fuselage , rendering it inoperable			1
and there 's one other possibility considered even more likely by some : the crash impact may have actually activated the beacon , but the damaged plane sank in less than 50 seconds , the time necessary for it to transmit its first emergency signal			1
the beacons do not work underwater			1
on friday , 49 days after flight 370 disappeared , no one can say with certainty what happened with the plane 's beacons			1
that has left some family members with a faint glimmer of hope , but others believing that the beacon system just failed			2
what are beacons ? beacons -- more formally called emergency locator transmitters , or @entity77 -- are devices that transmit an electronic distress signal in the event of a crash			1
unlike the so - called " pingers , " which help investigators zero in on a plane 's black boxes , @entity82 are intended to help rescuers locate the plane itself			0
and , unlike the pingers , they do not operate when submerged under water , owing to the natural laws that govern radio waves			0
@entity3 had four of them , @entity25 officials told @entity41			1
two of the @entity82 were stored with the airplane 's life raft , to be activated by hand or by contact with the water , if the life boats were deployed			0
the third @entity82 was stowed in the cabin			0
but the @entity82 of greatest interest is the remaining " fixed " @entity82 , mounted to the aircraft frame			0
the fixed @entity82 -- a @entity106 406 @entity105 -- was positioned near the rear door and connected to an antenna on top of the aircraft			0
it could be activated , either manually by a pilot in the cockpit , or automatically upon impact , by an inertial " g - switch			1
" the @entity106 406 @entity105 was designed " to provide emergency transmission for aircraft flying over land , " according to @entity106 's published specifications			1
" they are not mandated or designed to work under water , " a @entity106 spokesman told @entity41			1
but experts say any impact -- whether on land or at sea -- likely would have activated the transmitter			1
once activated , the device simultaneously transmits " bursts " -- short , digitally coded signals -- on three frequencies			0
two of the frequencies -- 243 mhz and @entity133 -- are vhf frequencies and can help search planes hone in on a target			0
the third frequency is 406 mhz. that 's where satellites come in			1
help from above in 1979 , the @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and the @entity144 teamed up to provide a global , satellite - based system to detect emergency beacons activated by planes , ships and backcountry hikers and to distribute those alerts to rescuers			1
known as the @entity153 , the enterprise claimed it made its first rescue in september 1982 , saving three people involved in the crash of a light aircraft in @entity142			0
" @entity160 has done an enormous amount of good in the world , but almost nobody has ever heard of us , " said @entity158 , an @entity141 diplomat and head of the @entity160 in @entity161			0
@entity160 relies on six low - altitude , @entity168 - orbiting satellites and six high - altitude geostationary satellites , each with advantages and disadvantages			1
the six low - altitude satellites , whose main function is to provide meteorological information , orbit the poles and give complete but non-continuous coverage of the @entity168 's surface			1
because they can only view a portion of the @entity168 at any given time , the satellite may need to store geographic information from an emergency beacon and rebroadcast it when it comes within view of a ground facility			2
the six geostationary satellites , parked in spots more than 22,000 miles above the equator , cover most of the @entity168 's surface but can not determine the location of the beacon unless the location is encoded in the signal			1
all of the satellites listen for a beacon 's 406 mhz signals and together can identify a beacon 's location to within approximately 3 kilometers , or just under 2 miles			2
if flight 370 's @entity82 had transmitted a 406 mhz signal , it " almost certainly would have been picked up by one of the geostationary satellites , " @entity158 said			1
two satellites , @entity208 's @entity207 and @entity210 's @entity209 , are both parked over the @entity211			2
it perhaps would have also been picked up by an orbiting low - altitude satellite			0
@entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 all have antennas that monitor the satellites ' emergency transmitter			1
some or all of them likely would have received the distress call			2
but authorities say no satellite signals were sent			0
other rescues @entity160 said about five people are rescued every day with the assistance of the satellite system			0
but the disappearance of large commercial jetliners is very rare , and consequently , so is the discovery of them			0
@entity160 said it was instrumental in finding a @entity236 that wandered off course and crashed in the @entity239 jungle in september 1989			0
and when a @entity241 dropped off radar near @entity243 in the @entity244 in 2009 , an @entity82 alert was the first confirmation to controllers that the aircraft had crashed			0
the organization also said it was the primary or sole source of location information in about 25 other cases involving aircraft with 10 or more passengers			2
somewhere in the @entity211 what can explain the lack of a signal in the @entity3 case ? assuming that the device was working correctly , the crash could have broken the antenna or cut the connection with the @entity82 , rendering it useless			1
another possibility , experts say , is that the aircraft could have sunk before the @entity82 began transmitting			0
it takes 50 seconds for the @entity82 to establish the necessary connection			0
it only takes one half - second data " burst " to indicate there is an emergency			2
but it can take a half - dozen bursts -- at the rate of one every 50 seconds -- to provide information that will allow @entity160 to triangulate the beacon 's position			0
" in this case , there was n't even one burst , according to the reports that we received , " @entity158 said			0
if the plane crashed in the southern @entity211 , as @entity286 officials believe , the lack of a distress call could indicate that the plane plunged into the water , or sank quickly , because once underwater , the beacon is ineffective			1
likewise , the water - triggered elts in the life rafts would be ineffective if they became submerged , according to published @entity106 manuals for the devices			0
@entity160 also notes that beacons must have a relatively unobstructed view of the sky to work properly			2
" a submerged beacon , or one with its antenna blocked by the body of an aircraft or vessel , is unlikely to be received by the satellites , " the organization said			2
said @entity306 spokesman @entity305 : " until the recorders are recovered , we do n't want to speculate what could or could not have happened			0
we ask the same thing you do , why did n't the @entity82 operate ? we do n't have the answer			0
" family questions in a recent letter to @entity25 authorities , a family group showered them with questions about the @entity82			0
how many @entity77 are on the plane , they asked , adding that they had gotten conflicting numbers			0
did @entity286 conduct maintenance checks ? when was the latest check for @entity3 's @entity82 ? they asked to see the results of those checks			1
was the 406 mhz beacon certified ? was it possible to break the @entity82 in a crash ? where exactly was it located ? would the @entity82 signal be weakened if it was surrounded by metal ? was the cable and blade @entity333 certified ? how much impact is needed to activate the @entity82 ? had the crew been trained in the use of @entity82 ? can a beacon unlock " and bounce [ float ] to the surface of the water ? " many of the questions remain unanswered			1
but @entity160 officials said that previous accidents have exposed shortcomings with the system and that they are working to improve it			0
among other things , they are testing a new constellation of mid-altitude satellites that can better determine the location of an @entity82			2
and government and industry officials are working on a new generation of @entity82 that can monitor a plane conditions , identify problems and send a distress signal before the plane ever reaches the ground			1

@entity3 had four beacons , or emergency locator transmitters
one was designed to activate on impact , but satellites did not receive a distress signal
the lack of a distress signal boosts hopes of passengers ' families
