-- the @entity1 voted thursday to reduce sentencing guidelines that could shorten prison stays for about 70 % of federal drug trafficking defendants , backing a proposal supported by the @entity6 and some conservative lawmakers			1
the unanimous vote by the commission sets in motion a change in the formula used to determine sentences for federal drug offenders			2
if @entity16 does n't object to the change , it would go into effect on november 1			2
" this modest reduction in drug penalties is an important step toward reducing the problem of prison overcrowding at the federal level in a proportionate and fair manner , " said judge @entity18 , chair of the commission			2
" reducing the federal prison population has become urgent , with that population almost three times where it was in 1991			0
" attorney general @entity31 testified in support of the reduced sentencing guidelines last month and he hailed the vote thursday			1
he said it " represents a milestone in our effort to reshape the criminal justice system 's approach to dealing with drug offenses			0
this reduction in the federal sentencing guidelines , while modest , sends a strong message about the need to reserve the harshest penalties for the most serious crimes			1
" @entity31 months earlier instructed prosecutors to start using their discretion to help accomplish some of the same goals , a move that some lawmakers and at least one federal judge on the sentencing commission interpreted as bypassing the legal authority of @entity16 and the commission			1
judge @entity57 , who serves on the @entity58 and is a member of the sentencing commission , said he was n't pleased that " before we voted on the amendment , the attorney general instructed assistant @entity65 attorneys across the nation not to object to defense requests to apply the proposed amendment in sentencing proceedings going forward			1
that unprecedented instruction disrespected our statutory role			0
" the federal prison system holds 216,000 prisoners			0
with only 5 % of the world 's population , the @entity65 has nearly 25 % of its prisoners			0
@entity31 , in a statement thursday , called on @entity16 to make further changes to sentencing guidelines , particularly those that reduce the discretion of judges on how to deal with drug offenders			1
he said legislation he is championing with some @entity89 lawmakers , such as sen. @entity90 , and @entity91 , such as sen. @entity92 , " would take further steps to reduce our overburdened prison system			0
