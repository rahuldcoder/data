it 's not a country			2
this , unfortunately , is a notion that needs to be constantly reinforced			2
though it is enormous and as diverse as any place can be , we tend , in the @entity9 , to look at it like a monolith			2
in fact , even neighboring countries like @entity13 and the @entity14 can feel , up close , as different as @entity16 and @entity17			2
@entity18 and @entity19 bear almost no resemblance to each other			2
@entity22 and @entity23 ? maybe it 's the sheer size and complexity of @entity27 issues -- the at times crushing weight of history , the ugliness of much of that history , @entity30 and the @entity9 's unambiguous complicity in so much of it -- that keeps us from even trying to look beyond the surface			2
over the years , my crew and i have shot in @entity18 , @entity22 , @entity19 , @entity0 , @entity41 , the @entity14 and much of @entity42			1
but what we 've never done , was step back to our first impressions , to the @entity0 of @entity48 films and nature documentaries that many of us grew up with : vast herds of wild animals charging across the @entity54 , lions and giraffes and zebras and hippos , safari gear , @entity60 and the equally magnificent " natives " in their brightly colored robes			1
does this @entity0 even exist ? and if so , how ? and for whom ? that @entity0 , the @entity65 does exist			1
you can find it in and around the unspeakably beautiful @entity68 in @entity69 where lions and their traditional adversaries , @entity73 warriors , still live much as they did a hundred years ago			1
the lions survive because they are protected			1
visiting @entity69 to gaze at and photograph these beautiful but deadly creatures ( and other animals ) is a major industry , bringing many millions to the country each year			1
it makes financial sense to protect both animals and the environment they live in			1
the @entity73 , on the other hand , believe themselves to be the keepers and protectors of all the world 's cattle			2
their status , their wealth is based almost entirely on number of cattle and goats			2
their diet , traditionally , has been almost exclusively meat ( mostly goat and the occasional bit of cow 's blood ) and dairy			0
they generally use their cattle to provide dairy and tap them for blood ( without harming them ) to mix with curdled milk			0
in return , adult @entity73 enjoy cardio and physical strength and endurance that would qualify as @entity113 any day of the week			0
they are herders -- and warriors			1
their status within their tribe , their image of themselves based largely on their traditional roles as defenders of their herds -- as warriors , lion killers			1
lions eat cattle and goats when they can get them			1
the @entity73 protect and rely on cattle and goats to live			0
lions roam over large areas of terrain , competing for food with any number of other predators			1
@entity73 herd their cattle over large areas of terrain			0
thus it has been for centuries			0
lions are beautiful living creatures worth many millions of dollars from the thousands and thousands of people from all over the world who want to come to @entity69 and gape at them			1
the @entity73 are beautiful living people who somewhat fewer people from all over the world want to come and gape at			0
many hard working , well - intentioned people are trying to help resolve this conflict of interest			0
but it raises , once again , the question we run into frequently in our travels : who does the natural world exist for ? for the people who live there , have always lived there ? even when they become ... inconvenient ? or the animals who also have always lived there , but like their adversaries , are under threat , and can no longer survive without the intervention of ( usually ) pale - skinned experts in comfortable shoes ? it 's an uncomfortable question			1
one would have to be truly monstrous to suggest that one be sacrificed for the other			0
but the slow grind of history is already making that decision for us , and the outcome is often not pretty			0
if we are the guardians of the environment , obligated to do our very best to protect the natural world -- if that natural world , increasingly , exists only at our pleasure and as the result of much hard work and vigilance -- are we not also our brothers ' keepers ? where is that line ? that balance between the needs of man and that of the incredible , graceful , terrible , gorgeous creatures who still manage to survive in what passes for the wild ? i sure as hell do n't know			1
so , on one hand , this episode is the " nature show " we always hoped to do -- the " safari show "			1
and believe me , we did it right			0
i retired , after a long day 's filming on the plains or in the bush , to a hot , freshly drawn bubble bath surrounded by rose petals			0
i drank sherry from a cut glass tumbler on my balcony , looking down into the @entity68			0
woke every morning to my choice of omelets and silver service			0
but the persistent image of this episode , the one that hangs in my memory , and i hope will hang in yours , is of the running man			0
where is he going ?			0

@entity227 steps back to his first impressions of @entity0 , a land of @entity48 films and nature documentaries
the show looks at the tension between lions and masai warriors
where is the line between protecting animals and protecting a way of life ?
