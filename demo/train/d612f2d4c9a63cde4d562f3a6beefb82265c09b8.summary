-- from color - popping dresses to bold prints and shapes , afro - centric designs have been storming catwalks in recent years , catching the eye of fashionistas across the world			0
but for many international consumers , especially those with no access to shops dedicated to @entity15 brands , it can often be hard to get their hands on designer garments from the continent			2
as a result , more and more @entity15 designers are taking their lines to the web in a bid to reach out to a larger market			1
and while many are setting up their own websites , others rely on internet boutiques which have more experience navigating the online market			0
one such store is my asho -- launched in june 2009 , this @entity32 - based web boutique carries the work of established and up - and - coming @entity15 designers , giving them a chance to showcase their creations to a wider audience			1
founder @entity41 says she started my asho -- taken from the @entity44 word " aso " which means cloth -- when she realized that @entity15 designers were not getting the promotion they deserved			1
" i contacted the top designers , i spoke to them and asked them about their struggle and how difficult it is for them , " says @entity41			1
" that 's really how it got started , so to create that credible infrastructure is to show the global demand for the products and that will kick start the productions			0
" today , @entity56 stocks a variety of womenswear , children 's clothes and accessories from more than 30 @entity15 designers			1
@entity41 says she is very careful when it comes to selecting new designers , making sure they have high professional standards			1
" we 're very happy to add new people in the site but we have to ensure that the designers we add are serious , " she says			0
" there are a lot of people out there who claim to be @entity15 designers but it 's more like ' oh , i have a tailor who can sew very well and who can copy items , ' so we have to distinguish between copy - cats and people doing this as a hobby			1
" one of the designers featured on the site is @entity86 who runs clothing label @entity87			0
she says my @entity34 is an ideal platform for her work , helping her to make her creations more visible as well as boost demand			2
" i think there 's still an element of investment that still needs to be done so we are recognized on an international as well as mainstream platform but i think my @entity34 is a perfect platform because since i 've been on there , i 've had a lot of international buyers and got into mainstream magazines			2
" and as this digital expansion is helping create more demand , many @entity15 designers are now having to keep up in their supply			1
@entity107 , a @entity108 - based designer who is the founder of the @entity110 brand , says the biggest challenge for many fashion designers is manufacturing			2
" you get a lot of excitement from so many places but once you get an order , how do you manufacture in large quantities ? " says @entity107			0
" so , that 's the issue that i 'm facing , trying to focus on quality control and trying to ensure that you consistently provide quality and appealing garments to other companies and other markets , " she adds			0
with clients in more than 50 countries , @entity41 's goal is to create a sustainable business model for @entity56			0
at the same time , she also wants her company to help her continent by supporting local @entity15 communities where the clothes are manufactured			1
as a result , @entity135 's prioritized working with ethical brands that show a commitment to fair labor practices and create opportunities for their communities			0
" i 'm supporting @entity15 , helping it grow and creating jobs but it 's not to say that a certain percentage of x is going to here because i do n't think that is a sustainable business model , " says @entity41			1
" i think it is better to create from the start ethical principles and work with designers who pay their tailors well , who are investing in helping their communities grow and then once you grow as a business then you know that they will also grow as well			2
