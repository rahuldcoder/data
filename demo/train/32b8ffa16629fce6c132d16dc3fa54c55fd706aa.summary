@entity0 -- if you 've ever wondered how much money charities spend mailing you those glossy brochures and free address labels along with their request for a donation , the answer might surprise you			0
@entity1 has found that this type of direct - mail marketing cost two veterans charities tens of millions of dollars			1
@entity0 - based @entity14 raised more than $ 22 million in donations over the past three years to help veterans , yet spent approximately $ 18.2 million paying its direct mail fund - raisers , according to @entity18 990 forms			1
for nearly a year , the charity has been trying -- without success -- to get out of its contract with @entity23 and its parent company , @entity24 , according to @entity14 's @entity25			2
" we were told for two years it would be very expensive , then we 'd be going into the black , " @entity25 told @entity1			0
" @entity24 is one of the world 's largest direct - mail providers to charities and non-profits			1
@entity24 is the same fund - raiser hired by the @entity36 - based @entity35 , which collected nearly $ 56 million in donations over the past three years , yet paid @entity24 more than $ 60 million in fees , according to a @entity1 investigation into the charity 's tax records			1
@entity24 confirmed that its relationship with @entity14 is ending because " fund - raising efforts did not prove as financially viable as the client had hoped , " a spokesman wrote in an e-mail to @entity1			1
@entity24 says although it increased the charity 's donor base by more than 700,000 people , the direct - mail provider recommended phasing out the program last august based on its performance			2
and despite @entity53 and @entity24 being paid more than $ 18 million by @entity14 , @entity24 says it actually lost money			0
meanwhile , @entity35 still has a business relationship with @entity56 through 2013			0
the independent group @entity57 gave both charities an " f " grade because of the miniscule amount of money they spend on actually helping veterans			1
" it 's as if you 're looking at these ratios through a fun house mirror , " @entity63 , @entity57 president , told @entity1			2
" it really ought to be reversed , it ought to be flipped , they ought to be giving 80 or 90 percent to helping veterans , not only 12 percent			1
" beyond its finances , the other services that the @entity14 offers to veterans are also questionable			0
on its website , it says one of its principal benefits to veterans is a toll - free hotline , but the @entity80 @entity79 in @entity36 operates several similar toll - free hotlines for veterans seeking a variety of services			0
in a statement , the charity said that it has been in business 27 years and that it serves thousands of veterans each year through its toll - free hotline			0
@entity1 attempted to visit the @entity14 office near the @entity89 , but staffers said that they would not speak on camera , refused to allow @entity1 inside , and declined @entity1 's request to photograph the call center that the charity says it operates there			0
@entity1 's recent investigation into the @entity35 found that the charity was doling out massive amounts of candy , hand sanitizer bottles and many other unnecessary items to veteran aid groups , surplus items it had obtained for free			0
it also claimed in its tax filings more than $ 838,000 in fair market value donations to one charity , although the bill of lading obtained by @entity1 showed that the donations -- which included chef 's coats and aprons -- was valued at around $ 234,000			2
@entity35 vice president @entity112 stressed that " not all the funds " raised by the foundation go to fund - raising			1
" the cost of fund - raising is high , as you know , and it has been for many veteran service organizations who use this kind of direct paying approach , " she said			1
but @entity57 's @entity63 says these charities are wasting public donations , and the only ones benefiting are the marketing firms			1
" we really have to ask why is this going on , what 's the point ? " he said in an interview with @entity1			0
" this really should be called the ' @entity133 - raising foundation ' rather than the @entity14 because ... the amount of help that the veterans receive is so small			2
