@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 investigators have asked diplomats from @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 to help identify the bodies of 72 presumed migrants discovered at a ranch in northeast @entity1			1
the nationalities of the deceased have not yet been confirmed , according to a statement released by @entity1 president @entity16 's office late wednesday			1
@entity8 said its @entity19 was informed there were at least four @entity8 among the dead , the official @entity18 news service reported wednesday evening			1
there was no further information about the identity of the dead @entity8 or exactly how many had been killed , the government - run news agency said			1
the statement by @entity16 said the @entity1 president " strongly condemns the acts that caused the death of 72 people , suspected to be migrants , " and said that drug gangs are repeatedly turning to extortion and kidnapping of migrants as their resources and recruits dwindle			1
" this is a result of the activity of the state against them , which has significantly weakened the operational capacity of criminal groups , " @entity16 's office said			1
initial reports indicated the migrants were headed to the @entity47			2
a surviving immigrant said he and the others were shot when they refused to work for a cartel , news reports said			0
it was not clear whether the cartel was smuggling the migrants or had abducted them			2
the @entity54 , a bipartisan , nonprofit policy institute based in @entity55 , noted in an august report that human smuggling and other illegal activities are playing an increasingly important role as narcotraffickers diversify their activities			0
" the drug cartels have not confined themselves to selling narcotics , " the report said			2
" they engage in kidnapping for ransom , extortion , human smuggling and other crimes to augment their incomes			0
" and the risk is increasing for @entity72 and @entity73 migrants crossing through @entity1 to get to the @entity47 , said @entity1 's @entity74			1
an investigation by the commission showed that 9,758 migrants were abducted from september 2008 to february 2009 , or about 1,600 per month			0
the bodies of the 58 men and 14 women discovered tuesday were found above ground in a building on the ranch , which is about 14 miles ( 22 kilometers ) from the town of @entity85 , near the border with @entity87			0
the @entity1 navy , which was called in to investigate the case , said it is one of the largest discoveries of bodies in @entity1 's 4 - year - old war on organized crime			1
members of the @entity1 navy were tipped off to the site after a man with a gunshot wound approached a military roadblock			1
the man said he had been injured by a criminal gang , according to a statement released by the navy			0
@entity1 's attorney general 's office identified the man as an @entity7 immigrant and said he had a bullet wound to the neck			1
" the navy went to the area where the man came from and encountered gunfights			0
a naval officer was killed and three of the delinquents were killed , " said an officer who answered the telephone at the navy 's communication department			0
the officer , who was not authorized to speak on the record , declined to give his name			0
after the gun battle , authorities said , they found a stash of weapons , including 21 rifles , camouflage uniforms , bulletproof vests and four trucks			0
one of the vehicles had been disguised to look like a truck from the @entity131 , officials said			0
a preliminary investigation indicated the victims were illegal immigrants from @entity6 , @entity5 , @entity8 and @entity7 , said @entity134 , spokesman for national security strategy			2
" this discovery once again demonstrates the extreme danger and violence that @entity72 face on their treacherous journey north , as well as @entity1 authorities ' abject failure to protect them , " @entity136 said			1
" @entity1 must immediately investigate this massacre , bring the perpetrators to justice and establish the identities of those killed so that their families can be informed			1
" wednesday 's gruesome discovery came about a month after authorities in the neighboring state of @entity153 discovered 51 bodies in nine mass graves			0
in that instance , investigators found charred remains , incinerated bone fragments and stains of fire on the ground where bodies were presumably burned in steel drums , the state - run @entity157 news agency said			0
similar mass graves have been discovered in the @entity1 states of @entity170 and @entity171 since late may			2
authorities have linked them to @entity1 's ongoing drug war			2
@entity153 and @entity175 , which border @entity87 , have seen a marked increase in drug violence this year due to an intensifying rivalry between the @entity180 cartel and the @entity182 gang , which was formerly the cartel 's armed branch			0
more than 28,000 people have died in drug - related incidents since @entity16 intensified the government 's fight against drug cartels and organized crime after taking office in december 2006 .			1

new : the dead are *believed* to be @entity72 and @entity73 migrants crossing @entity1
@entity8 says at least four @entity8 were among the dead
@entity16 says criminals are extorting migrants as @entity1 government weakens cartels
three suspects and a member of the @entity1 military were killed in a shootout
