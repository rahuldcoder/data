-- in the end , @entity2 ' massive gamble paid off			1
like many young girls , she sat glued to the tv during the @entity6 , mesmerized by the dazzling gymnasts flipping their way to glory			0
but instead of living vicariously through @entity11 and @entity12 as they won their gold medals , 12 - year - old @entity10 hatched a drastic plan to ensure that fairy tale became her reality : she must train with @entity11 's coach , even if that meant leaving her family in @entity22			1
" she started saying , ' i need that coach			2
i need coach @entity27 , ' " her mother , @entity25 , recalled to @entity26			1
@entity27 soared to international fame as a @entity30 gymnast before settling down in the middle of @entity32 to teach @entity34 gymnasts			1
it was there where @entity11 morphed from a 6 - year - old novice to a world - class athlete			2
@entity2 takes gold but @entity27 's gym was 1,200 miles away from @entity10 , her siblings and her mother , who did n't think the idea would work			1
" i said , well , i ca n't move the family to @entity32			0
i 'm a single parent ; i did n't have the resources to do something like that , " @entity25 said			0
but @entity10 was n't just headstrong ; she was a rare talent who vaulted up the ranks of gymnastics at an early age			1
she won a @entity22 state championship at age 8 , just two years after starting formal training			0
" she just never wanted to come out of the gym , " @entity25 said			0
she would just practice all the time			0
so i saw then the hard work			0
" but in order to reach her full potential , @entity10 insisted she needed an elite coach -- specifically , the one she had admired on tv			1
at age 14 , @entity10 received her mother 's blessing to go train with @entity27			1
the tiny athlete headed west and moved in with a host family with four younger girls , including another one of @entity27 's students			1
' @entity75 ' brings home gold for gymnastics both @entity25 and her daughter would have to learn how to be a family five states apart			2
" that was very painful			0
how would i still be @entity84 back in @entity22 when she 's living in @entity32 ? how does that work ? " @entity25 said			2
it was n't just the physical distance that strained the family			0
@entity10 ' gymnastics took a heavy financial toll , too			1
" sometimes it felt crushing			0
i did n't think i could keep her in this sport , " @entity25 said			0
" but then i 'd think about it and say , you 've got to fight			0
" @entity10 fought , too , battling through nerves and falls during her early days with @entity27 to bounce back in time for the 2012 @entity98 trials -- where she topped the field and nabbed the only guaranteed spot on the @entity98 team			1
along the way , she was nicknamed " the @entity2 " for her remarkably high release moves on the uneven bars			2
in her two years with @entity27 , @entity10 won a team gold medal at the 2011 world championships in @entity108 , another team gold medal at the @entity110 and finally the sweetest prize of them all -- the @entity98 individual all - around championship			1
at 4 feet , 11 inches tall , @entity10 now stands on top of the gymnastics world			2
complete coverage on the @entity110			0

@entity2 of the @entity34 is the new @entity98 women 's all - around gymnastics champion
@entity10 *decided* at age 12 she wanted to work with coach @entity27
she moved away from her family at age 14 to chase her @entity98 dream
