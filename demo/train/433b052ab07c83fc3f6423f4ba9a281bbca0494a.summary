-- one would think that becoming engaged would make a woman happy , right ? well , if status updates on @entity5 are any indication -- and at least two research scientists say they are -- that theory is all wrong			1
@entity8 and @entity9 spend their days tracking trends on @entity5 where the roughly 400 million users give them a totally unprecedented insight into human behavior			2
together , they study what @entity5 calls the " @entity17 , " an application " that measures the positive and negative sentiments expressed in status posts , " and what they 've discovered is that becoming engaged makes women less happy than they were before getting engaged			1
the @entity25 marriage may be a health risk " maybe this is the effect of having to plan a wedding , " @entity8 told the @entity27 in an article ( " @entity29 in @entity30 " ) that ran on may 12			0
" while the process of being engaged is stressful for women , once you 're married , then in general , you 're less negative than you were before			0
but if you 're a man , then something else changes , it increases the negativity			2
these fit the gender stereotypes so perfectly that it 's almost uncanny			0
" @entity5 's " @entity41 " prototype app as someone who has wasted too much time perusing a popular website that pokes fun at status updates from people who are happily -- often annoyingly so -- coupled up , i kind of have a hard time believing these findings			1
it 's all , " ooh , another lovely evening at home waiting for the pizza delivery and watching my husband clip his toenails ! " and : " i 'm getting marrriiieeeeed , suckas ! " whether these people are truly happy or just want people to think they are is open for debate , but i have a hard time believing they 're illustrating " negative " tendencies			2
then again , i deleted my @entity5 account months ago , so maybe i 'm simply missing out on the " woe is me " updates from the newly engaged and married			1
the @entity0 : @entity65 drowns her food in @entity67 another finding the researchers have discovered is that " being in an open relationship ' is uniformly bad , ' decreasing positive feelings by 15 percent compared with single people			0
" interestingly , it 's women who are actually less negative about open relationships than their male counterparts			0
who would have though that ? the @entity0 : bad breakup gave me more confidence on a different note , it 's a little creepy that people on @entity5 -- all 400 million of you -- are unwitting participants in these research studies , is n't it ? as if there were n't already enough performance anxiety when writing one 's status update			1
now you 've got to write about what you had for lunch and worry about what researchers think that says about your happiness level			0

study finds women not - so - happy after getting engagement ring
two researchers gathered data from @entity5 status updates
after wedding , women 's negativity lessens , men 's negativity increases
