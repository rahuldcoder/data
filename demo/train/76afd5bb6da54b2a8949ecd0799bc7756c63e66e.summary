@entity0 -- the connection seems obvious : nearly 400 acres of land set aside to house veterans and thousands of veterans who need a place to call home			1
but @entity0 ' estimated 8,000 homeless vets have been barred from living at the sprawling campus for decades			1
the @entity11 property -- some of the most valuable in the nation -- was donated in 1888 to " establish , construct and permanently maintain " a branch of a national home for veterans , according to the original deed			1
and for nearly a century , that 's what happened : permanent veterans facilities sprang up , including a post office , a trolley system and housing for as many as 4,000 vets , said @entity25 lawyer @entity24			1
but " beginning with the @entity31 era , vets were kicked out , " said @entity24 , who 's leading a class - action suit over the property against the @entity28			1
now , a generation after @entity31 , the facility 's abandoned buildings are off limits to the veterans they were intended to serve			0
" it 's a shame , " said @entity38 , a descendant of the heiress who donated the land			2
veterans should be " given every single opportunity to rehab their lives -- and if they have no place to live , a place to live			2
" the @entity48 saw fit to lease parts of the property to several businesses			1
in september , the @entity48 canceled three leases after rising criticism			2
but other entities remain on the property including a public golf course , a college baseball stadium , a theater and practice fields for the exclusive private @entity60			2
@entity1 's initial requests to the va for its side of the lawsuit were referred to the @entity64 , which said it would n't comment while the case is still pending			0
vet : ' i just wanted to die or go to prison ' @entity70 war veteran @entity69 , 22 , is n't part of the lawsuit , but he has spent years battling addiction , post-traumatic - stress disorder and homelessness			2
as an 18 - year - old high school senior , @entity69 signed up with the @entity76 intending to " go to college and make something of myself , " he said			0
" and the @entity76 said they 'd pay for it			0
" he was deployed to @entity70 for a year as part of a quick response unit that saw constant action			0
upon his return to @entity87 's @entity86 , @entity69 was diagnosed with @entity88			0
nightmares and paranoia haunted him			0
according to @entity76 papers , he once spent a day drinking and sitting on his bed pointing with the barrel of an illegal sawed - off shotgun in his mouth			0
" i just wanted to die or go to prison , " he said			0
" and that was where i was headed and i knew that was where i was going and i was ok with that			0
" after leaving the @entity76 , @entity69 ended up homeless in @entity105 and later @entity0 , where he " was doing a lot of methamphetamines " and " smoking a lot of dope			1
" study : @entity88 signals long - term health problems accurate figures are hard to come by , but the va in its most recent report estimates about 107,000 veterans find themselves homeless on any given night			0
mental illness plagues 45 % of homeless vets and 70 % suffer from some kind of substance abuse , according to the @entity48			1
@entity120 has ok 'd $ 35.5 million to renovate various buildings on the campus including " building 209 for housing facilities for homeless veterans , " according to a bill signed by president @entity126 this month			0
the facility would provide vets with 70 permanent housing units , far short of the living space needed to house @entity0 's homeless vets			1
the @entity48 has launched an aggressive national plan with an ambitious goal : eliminating homelessness among veterans by 2015			2
under the joint program with the @entity137 , homeless veterans get federal vouchers to help them pay rent			0
this summer the @entity48 granted nearly $ 60 million to nonprofit groups that help veterans , including more than $ 7 million to aid an estimated 1,800 vets in @entity143			1
the money aims to prevent veterans and their families from slipping into homelessness by helping with basic expenses such as rent , utilities security deposits and moving costs			0
occupy the park ? @entity154 , whose story was made famous in the 1989 @entity157 film " born on the @entity158 , " said the $ 35.5 million is n't enough			1
paralyzed in the @entity31 , the @entity159 has been working to improve @entity48 treatment of returning troops since his own homecoming in the late 1960s			2
@entity154 is calling for an occupation protest of the @entity0 property , not unlike the current @entity167 movement			1
" if that land was given to veterans and if we were able to put at least a small percentage of what we 're spending on these wars in @entity70 and @entity174 toward building a facility for homeless and disabled veterans , " @entity154 told @entity1 , " i think it would be one of the most honorable things we could do as citizens and one of the most honorable things that the @entity48 could do to make up for the mistakes of the past			1
" @entity185 sen. @entity184 of @entity143 , told @entity1 via an email statement that she 's concerned about the rising number of homeless vets in @entity0 and believes that " updated and new facilities are needed at the @entity48			1
" " i intend keep working to make sure that @entity190 does n't stop " with the latest improvements , she said			0
@entity48 secretary @entity198 " has told me he is committed to renovating two additional buildings on the campus , and we intend to hold him and the administration to that commitment			2
" meanwhile , @entity48 attorneys have asked a federal judge to throw the @entity25 lawsuit out of court			1
" in fact , according to @entity24 the @entity64 attorney said , ' we do n't believe that the @entity48 has any authority or any responsibility to provide housing			2
" but dr. @entity208 , chief of staff of @entity0 ' @entity48 health care system seemed to contradict that			1
" i think we have the resources with the community to end homelessness for veterans in @entity0 , " @entity208 said			2
@entity208 said new housing is being created for homeless vets and those who need help should call 1 - 877 - @entity218 ( 1 - 877 - 424 - 3838 ) to start the process that will put them in safe housing			1
as for @entity69 , he 's currently living at a halfway house in hopes of leaving his homeless life behind			0
he thinks the @entity11 property could help many more homeless vets win their personal battles			1
" it would get a number of people in off the street and get them doing what they need to be doing to get their life together , " said @entity69			0
meanwhile , the judge has refused to throw out the case and has appointed a mediator to try and resolve the situation beginning this week			1
" i promise you that these gates will be open , " said @entity24			0
" we will win this case			0
" @entity1 's @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246 contributed to this report .			0
