@entity0 -- it was , until today , something that happened to sporting codes elsewhere , never in @entity5			1
as a result , the finding of widespread use of banned drugs across professional sports by elite athletes has shocked the @entity5 sporting world			1
the @entity14 's year long investigation also found links between drug use and organized crime and at least one instance of possible match - fixing			1
" it 's cheating , but it 's worse than that			0
it 's cheating with the help of criminals , " @entity5 justice minister @entity23 told a media conference in @entity25 attended by the heads of many of the countries ' major sporting codes			1
the probe uncovered the use of banned drugs , including peptides and a number of others drugs , some of which have as yet not been tested for humans			2
worse , they have been used , according to the @entity14 report , in orchestrated doping programs facilitated by coaches , sports scientists , support staff , doctors and pharmacists			1
it is this that most shocks @entity50 sports commentator @entity49			2
" sports people are always pushing the envelope			2
everyone does that , " @entity49 told @entity1			0
" so if you find a drug and it 's not on the banned list you will give it a go , " he said			0
but that entire teams of elite athletes may be systematically using illegal substances to enhance their performance with the knowledge and help of sports scientists , coaches and doctors , leaves @entity49 astounded			2
" the sports scientists and sports teams which are potentially doping , that 's shocking , " said @entity49			1
" but are they going to go down ? " he asks			0
tip of the iceberg all of this comes in the same week that the @entity77 in @entity78 approached the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) and @entity80 ( @entity80 ) to investigate claims that its players took substances that may be illegal			1
shocking though the claim was , it may turn out to be the tip of the iceberg in a nation which prides itself on being at the forefront of clean sport			0
the substances the @entity77 believes its players may have used are believed to include peptide or related substances that were injected			0
some peptides are legal for athletes to inject			0
the investigation is expected to focus on whether the illegal substances the club believes its players used was inert peptide , or otherwise , and whether the drugs were administered as part of a fitness regime			2
players could face season suspensions , though legendary @entity79 coach @entity105 said after the @entity14 findings were released that suspension might not be enough			1
" we need to get rid of it -- we need to find the people and eradicate them from the sport , " he told local reporters			0
though the @entity14 has not named specific athletes or clubs that are under current investigation , the @entity112 ( @entity112 ) says more than one of its players and more than one of its clubs are under investigation			1
the code has already committed to an audit and register of people supplying performance services to its players and clubs , as well as centralized testing for illicit substances			2
integrity units all sporting codes have expressed shock at the findings as they pledged full co-operation with @entity80 and other investigating authorities			1
the @entity79 , the @entity112 , the @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 have agreed to establish integrity units and have called on athletes to own up and co-operate in return for reduced sanctions			1
@entity49 said he was surprised that the findings were made public while active investigations are ongoing			2
" there are still a lot of qualifiers , " added @entity49			0
but according to @entity150 , the former chief of the @entity80 , the report 's findings are no surprise			1
he said the involvement of criminal networks was well known to the anti-doping agency			0
" having worked with @entity80 for the past five years it was very clear that there were links between elements of organized crime importing and distributing prohibited substances across @entity5 sport , " @entity150 told @entity1			1
nor was @entity79 chief @entity161 surprised by the links between the supply of drugs and organized crime			1
" organized crime is very pervasive , " he told the @entity25 media conference			0
" they find vulnerable players			0
they infiltrate , " said the @entity79 chief			0
" and all of us here today would say that today is the day we draw a line in the sand			0
we address it , we tackle it			0
sport is too important in this community			0
" but @entity161 denied that @entity77 went to the authorities with its illicit drug taking suspicions as a result of the @entity14 investigation			2
the @entity14 's report draws on past international cases to warn of a potential link between the involvement of crime gangs in sport and match - fixing			1
" overseas experience has demonstrated that organized criminal groups involved in match - fixing are increasingly targeting sub-elite athletes due to the ease with which these individuals can be ' bought ' , the lower levels of scrutiny from integrity authorities at sub-elite competitions , and the potential long - term value of these athletes to the criminal group , " it said			1
president of the @entity204 @entity203 said that it 's not surprising that the problem has surfaced in @entity5			2
" it is very clear from @entity208 and we have a close association with them in @entity204 , that the suppliers , manufacturers , traffickers of the performance enhancing drugs are the same people who are connected with the illegal drugs , the same people who are connected with match - fixing and illegal gambling so i guess it 's not surprising that it now surfaces in this country , " @entity203 told @entity50			2
sports betting the deputy victorian police commissioner , @entity224 , said soccer , cricket and tennis were most at risk of match - fixing by organized criminals because they attracted big offshore bets			1
" the increasing betting pools mean that we need to take preventative action now to make these sports more resilient to this threat , " he told reporters			0
former @entity239 coach , @entity238 , now a mentor for the @entity240 , thinks it would be difficult to fix a match in rugby			0
' the one thing that 's magnificent about rugby union is that it 's such a difficult game to even think about match - ixing , '' @entity238 told @entity247 in @entity248			0
'' in other games when the margins are nil - nil results , or a team concedes one goal ... rugby is such a fluid and dynamic game that it would stick out like a sore thumb if you even try to do something that 's match - fixing , " he said			0
an independent senator in the @entity5 @entity262 , @entity263 , wants an immediate suspension of all sports betting until all investigations are complete			1
" these extraordinary findings require an urgent response to protect the integrity of sporting codes that millions of @entity5 love , " senator @entity263 said .			1
