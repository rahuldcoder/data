, observed this week that the @entity5 public typically goes through wartime " cycles " : first showing sweeping support and then , as civilian and military deaths begin , growing impatient and putting pressure on politicians to end hostilities			1
therefore , as @entity1 put it , " the ability of the @entity5 home front to withstand a campaign that lasts for more than a week is a key factor in the outcome			2
" in recent years , though , @entity5 's missile defense system , @entity17 , has had a significant impact on that home front 's resilience -- and therefore on the calculus of @entity5 's leaders			1
of course , @entity5 's overwhelming military superiority over @entity25 - based militants ensures that @entity5 deaths in @entity25 wars have always been relatively low			1
nine @entity5 were killed in the two - week ground offensive in 2009 , @entity29 , compared to well over a thousand @entity30			2
the november 2012 airstrikes , @entity32 , resulted in six @entity5 deaths compared to 167 @entity30			1
but the political impact of rocket attacks is greater than these numbers suggest , particularly when usually safe areas come under fire			1
in 2012 , @entity40 ' longer - range rockets targeted both @entity41 , causing air raid sirens to sound there for the first time since @entity44 fired scud missiles towards the city during the first @entity47 two decades previously , and @entity48 , which had not been struck since 1970			0
although no casualties were inflicted , @entity40 demonstrated its ability to threaten @entity5 's two largest and most important cities			2
it has done so again in the past week , and additionally promised to target @entity52			0
although @entity40 faces difficulties in importing its most sophisticated rockets , owing to the new @entity57 government 's demolition of key tunnels connecting @entity25 with the @entity59 , @entity5 's head of @entity61 estimates that the group has still managed to double its stockpile since the 2012 war , to approximately 10,000 rockets , suggesting that it could sustain attacks for months			1
the @entity5 leadership therefore faces twin pressures			0
on the one hand , as @entity1 suggests , an open - ended campaign of airstrikes that fails to suppress rocket attacks or demonstrate other strategic achievements could meet with increasing public opposition			1
on the other hand , a successful rocket attack that inflicts deaths -- particularly in a symbolic area , like @entity41 or @entity48 -- could put sudden pressure on @entity5 leaders to escalate , and send ground troops into @entity25			1
any such invasion , involving urban combat in a densely populated urban environment that @entity40 knows well , would result in higher @entity3 casualties , extremely high @entity30 casualties , enormous damage to civilian infrastructure , and the prospect of @entity5 troops being taken hostage			1
this is why , despite getting his cabinet to authorize the enlistment of 40,000 reservists last week , prime minister @entity94 has refrained from launching a ground assault			0
@entity5 's @entity17 missile defense system , which came to prominence in the 2012 conflict , affects this dynamic in important ways			1
although there is intense debate over its effectiveness -- critics argue that the system is knocking rockets to the ground without detonating them , and that it destroys fewer than half -- @entity5 says that it has successfully intercepted 90 % of those rockets that it engaged in this campaign			2
even if this is exaggerated , @entity17 's ability to shield population centers and key infrastructure has two important effects			0
first , it buys time for @entity5 to continue airstrikes without facing popular impatience			0
second , it lessens the prospect that a rocket will inflict deaths in a way that forces the government to launch a costly ground invasion it does n't truly want			1
taken together , this suggests that @entity17 gives the @entity3 more time to strike @entity25 from the air , and therefore to weaken @entity40 , with less pressure to put boots on the ground			2
it is important to note that even if @entity17 is highly effective , there are still other sources of pressure on the @entity5 government			0
calling up tens of thousands of reservists in a country of just 8 million people places strain on the domestic economy , and pressure quickly mounts to demobilize those forces			0
moreover , international pressure also grows over time			0
for instance , @entity57 president @entity145 is hostile to @entity40 and has refrained from commenting , but a mounting @entity30 death toll would draw him further into the conflict , possibly persuading him to open land borders with @entity25			0
finally , the longer the conflict drags on , the greater the likelihood that @entity17 's imperfections will be revealed , and that a rocket will get through			0
these factors mean that the clock is still ticking for @entity94 -- though perhaps at a slower pace than it used to			0
how @entity17 blocks rockets from @entity25 , protects @entity5 @entity158 fired into northern @entity5 from @entity159 as @entity25 conflict continues striking @entity25 could buy @entity5 peace for a year , maybe more , analysts say			2

@entity5 deaths in @entity25 wars have always been relatively low , writes @entity166
@entity166 : political impact of rocket attacks is greater than these numbers suggest though
@entity5 invasion of @entity25 would carry big military and political risks , he says
missile defense means @entity5 need not resort to ground troops , @entity166 argues
