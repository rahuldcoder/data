-- amid all the talk of helicopter parents and @entity3 , let us now praise @entity5			1
not to be confused with the @entity6 , who flamboyantly disappoints , the @entity7 exceeds expectations without drawing attention to himself			1
i am the son of a @entity7 , as are a number of my friends			1
several have lost their @entity5 in recent years			1
for the rest of us , time is precious			0
the @entity7 is at the end of a good run			1
social media has made stealth unfashionable , with every utterance now an exhibition			1
and private family milestones have been outsourced to consultants			0
when i read about the parent hiring a coach to teach a kid to ride a bike , i mourned for the @entity7			1
in the end , the passing of a generation will finish the job			2
demographers @entity32 and @entity33 describe @entity34 born between 1925 and 1942 as the @entity35			0
this is the rich vein of @entity7 ore			1
stuck between @entity39 heroes and look - at - @entity40 , the @entity35 never produced a @entity34 president			0
instead , say @entity32 and @entity33 , @entity42 became @entity34 's " facilitators and technocracts			2
" silents had ready access to college and jobs and avoided heavy war casualties			0
silents experienced other frustrations , forever the " gap " in the generation gap that divided @entity55 leadership from 1960s revolutionaries			2
@entity32 and @entity33 explain that , for @entity42 , " their solutions -- fairness , openness , due process , expertise -- reflect a lack of surefootedness , but also a keen sense of how and why humans fall short of grand civic plans or ideal moral standards			0
silent appeals for change have seldom arisen from power or fury , but rather through a self - conscious humanity and tender social conscience			2
" i like the notion of a tender social conscience			2
it fits my own @entity7 , who married the pretty girl at a @entity82 picnic , became a math teacher and then the principal who peacefully integrated the high school in the town of @entity87 , @entity88			1
he served for years as an associate superintendent in @entity90 , indispensable in the technocrat role			0
once retired , he worked as the business manager for a church			0
now , at 76 , @entity94 keeps marshmallows in his pocket , for his granddaughter @entity97			0
my close friends and i are also generational misfits , too young to be authentic boomers and too old to line up neatly with gen @entity101 @entity7 attended some , not all , of our sporting events			1
when @entity7 was there , he never threw a tantrum			1
when he was n't there , we behaved as if he was			0
in crisis , @entity7 lowers the volume			1
@entity7 does n't speak up unless he can improve upon the silence			1
@entity7 is parsimonious with counsel			1
having been spared a thousand aphorisms , we had no choice but to direct our attention to the specific @entity7 behaviors plainly predictive of a successful life			1
@entity7 puts fairness above nearly everything else			1
i walked to my elementary school			0
on the few rainy days when my @entity7 would drive me , he used our family car			1
then he drove back home and set out for the office in a county - owned car provided by the school system			0
this vehicle was only to be used for work			0
while he follows rules , @entity7 challenges authority			2
back in 1968 , when many country clubs where still accessible only to whites , my @entity7 appointed an @entity134 man , @entity133 , to be golf coach for our town 's newly integrated high school			1
my @entity7 was in the audience last month when @entity133 was inducted into the @entity140			2
in the @entity142 we attended through my childhood , there came a time when one half of the congregation grew furious at the other half			0
if you have spent time in baptist churches , this is not as consequential as it sounds			0
yet in this case , the dispute could not be settled without a public airing of grievances			0
the hearing would take place during a business meeting that would follow the sunday service			0
the only thing the feuding groups could agree on was that my @entity7 would facilitate , from the pulpit			2
there i sat in the church balcony , like @entity166 looking down at the trial below , learning to turn off the fury and manifest self - conscious humanity			0
on good days , i can pull it off myself			0
@entity171 to @entity5 everywhere .			2

@entity173 : my **father** was part of a generation of @entity5
he says today 's **father**s are more likely to draw attention to themselves , in social media era
he says his **father** was always there for him when he needed to be
bare : @entity7 does n't speak up unless he can improve on the silence
