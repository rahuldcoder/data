-- people have used animal imagery in their decorating since they were painting ancient beasts on cave walls			1
there 's nothing new about the look , @entity10 interiors editor @entity9 said , but there is a modern approach trotting through homes			1
the current way to use animal prints , figurines , imagery , hides and bones in home decor is full of whimsy , he said			1
it takes the old - world tradition of stately trophies to a very fun place			1
" people have learned to pare down , " he said			1
" more people are spending more time at home , and there 's a freedom , " in the way modern homebodies are decorating			1
" it looks like someone lives there			2
" he keeps two antique , mounted deer heads in his country home in @entity43			2
" i think they are absolutely beautiful			0
i love their antlers , " he said			0
and when he 's greeted at the door by one of those handsome stags , @entity9 said , " it 's like , ' hi ! how are you ? ' " personality is what @entity54 and @entity56 's @entity55 , @entity57 , loft exudes			0
they 're charmed by deer , birds and other woodland creatures , and they 've displayed a taxidermy peacock and fox as well as some of @entity68 's original artwork -- deer , owl and opossum figures shaped from bullet holes			0
" the opossum is the most divisive of all the animals , " @entity68 said of the animal decor in their home			1
" some people are thrilled by it , but others ca n't stand it			1
" and that 's where use of animals in decorating gets controversial , @entity9 said			0
taxidermy animals , deer antlers and animal skin rugs , although considered high style , are not necessarily as accepted today as they were a century ago , @entity9 said			1
in the same way that people choose not to wear a fur coat , he said , people might choose not to decorate with organic animal parts			1
" everyone has their phobias , " he said			0
that 's partially why reproductions and abstract versions -- animal print textiles , ceramic sculpture and " fauxidermy , " for example -- are in vogue , @entity9 said			1
" i think the problem that people have with taxidermy is when it does not make sense , " @entity68 said			1
" when you see a random animal head on a wall it usually looks out of place , but when you go to a museum of natural history , the animals are presented in a scene			1
we have tried to do that , " he said of his loft 's menagerie			0
one of the focal points in the @entity127 ' living room is their collection of antique deer antlers			0
" we started buying antlers at flea markets and antique stores , " @entity68 said			0
" we thought about placing them on a wall in a hunting lodge presentation , but then we found an antique baby wash tub and thought they would make a great centerpiece			0
" " everyone has liked them , " he said , " or they have been too nice to say otherwise			0
" so how can you take advantage of modern animal trends in home decor ? here are some lessons from this week 's @entity149 contributors : animal prints are the new beige " i 've used animal prints in pretty much every room			1
i feel like animal prints are a neutral and i tend to use them in their natural color or off - white			1
" -- @entity158 " i love animal prints such as leopard and zebra because they act as a neutral and go with virtually any color scheme and style			1
it brings a global feel to a room while somehow managing to add whimsy and sophistication at the same time			0
" -- @entity169 take animals seriously , but play with decor " i love animals and i love having them in my home			1
of course it 's all faux decor because i do n't want any animals to get hurt to be in my home			1
it 's the perfect addition of quirkiness and i need it in every room			0
" -- @entity180 " foxes are very much the new owl			0
the woodlands is a great decor trend to follow because it can vary from super sweet and playful to a more dark and mysterious side of the spectrum			2
" -- @entity68 remember that a little goes a long way " i think it 's important when designing a space with animal prints , just as in fashion , to pair the piece with more subdued patterns or solid colors			2
you want the print to pop and not compete with other decor elements			2
" -- @entity201 " my updated - cottage style living room needed a new chair and i wanted something unique			2
the chair already had cool ball and claw feet , which inspired my choice for animal print upholstery			2
" -- @entity210 enjoy rugs for their durability and unique shape " i specifically wanted to use a cowhide rug for its durability			0
it does n't stain ! you can spill red wine and not worry about it ! that makes it an ideal choice for a room where eating is the primary purpose			2
" -- @entity226 " i often recommend animal hide rugs -- @entity228 has gorgeous faux ones if you wanta cruelty - free option -- because the organic shape can bring interest to any space			1
real hide rugs are completely stain repellent so are perfect for high traffic areas or city living			0
" -- @entity201 consider sentiment and stories " i purchased the white ceramic dog because it looks just like my dog , @entity243			0
the ceramic dog is sitting on top of my late grandparents ' 1920s buffet in our dining room			0
since the buffet has a very antique look to it , i wanted to use more modern looking accessories			2
" -- @entity254 " one morning while searching my usual favorite categories on ( @entity256 ) , i typed in ' antlers ' thinking fall was on the way and some loose antlers would be nice accessories			0
to my surprise , this huge mounted pair was listed , ' free to a good home			2
' after i rushed over to pick them up , the man told me that the family story was that his grandfather had acquired the antlers in @entity270 in 1910			0

animal hides and bones have been a part of decor since ancient times
modern versions involve cruelty - free animal decor , like " fauxidermy "
