@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 @entity3 on thursday convicted prime minister @entity4 of contempt of court but gave him just a symbolic sentence that will not require him to serve time in prison			1
the court found @entity4 guilty of the contempt charge after his repeated refusals to ask @entity15 authorities to revive old corruption charges against the country 's president , @entity17			2
that makes him the first sitting @entity1 prime minister to be convicted of a crime			1
but the court sentenced him only for the duration of the hearing , which lasted several minutes			0
he could have faced as much as six months in jail			0
an opposition leader said @entity4 should resign following the guilty verdict , but members of the prime minister 's cabinet insisted he would continue in his role and appeal the decision			1
the conviction means @entity4 could be disqualified as prime minister , but that 's a process that could take up to four months			1
" i think that after the conviction the prime minister should immediately step down from his post , " @entity35 , a prominent opposition leader , said on @entity36			1
by remaining in power , @entity4 risks harming the credibility of parliament , @entity35 said			2
but members of @entity4 's government criticized the court 's decision as being politically motivated			1
" the verdict is unconstitutional and immoral , " @entity47 , the federal minister for capital administration and development , said on @entity50 , a local channel			0
" the prime minister has the confidence of the parliament , so he will continue as the prime minister , " he said			1
@entity56 , the deputy interior minister , said the government planned to appeal against the verdict			2
@entity4 was convicted for " willful flouting , disregard and disobedience of this court 's direction , " said @entity63 as he read out the decision			0
the judge said that " the contempt committed by him is substantially detrimental to the administration of justice and tends to bring this court and the judiciary of this country into ridicule			0
" @entity4 's lawyers argued that the prime minister had not followed the court 's order to press for the reopening of the charges because @entity17 enjoys immunity in @entity1 and abroad as a president in office			1
most observers had expected that a conviction would come without a prison sentence			0
" they donÂ¹t want to make a spectacle out of it , " the columnist and analyst @entity85 said earlier this week			0
" a prison sentence would create an unnecessary political drama			0
" " time in prison would create a wave of sympathy for the prime minister , and that 's something the judges do n't want to see , " said author and political analyst @entity91			1
this is not the first time @entity4 has fallen foul of @entity1 's legal system			2
he served more than five years in prison between 2001 and 2006 on corruption charges brought by the previous military regime of gen. @entity104 -- counts he said were also politically motivated			1
the corruption cases that the @entity3 now wants reopened stem from money - laundering charges against @entity17 and his late wife , former prime minister @entity108			1
a @entity15 court convicted them in absentia in 2003 of laundering millions of dollars			0
after @entity104 granted a controversial amnesty in 2007 to @entity17 , @entity108 , and thousands of other politicians and bureaucrats , @entity1 asked the @entity15 authorities to drop the case			0
in 2009 , the @entity1 @entity3 ruled the amnesty was unconstitutional and called on the government to take steps to have the cases reopened			2
the government did not do so , and the court lost patience			0
since @entity4 is the head of the government , the court justices view him as responsible			2
@entity2 's @entity124 and journalist @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
