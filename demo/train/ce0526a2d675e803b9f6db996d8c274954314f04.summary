-- the @entity4 champions @entity3 -- regarded as one of the most colorful teams in @entity8 history with players nicknamed " @entity10 , " " da coach , " " sweetness , " and a punk quarterback -- has been invited to the @entity2 next month to make up for a visit that was canceled 25 years ago , a @entity2 official told @entity0 thursday			1
as it turns out , president @entity14 , who is from @entity16 's @entity15 , happens to be a big @entity3 fan			1
the team will visit @entity20 on october 7 , the official said			1
the @entity3 ' initial @entity22 visit to the @entity2 was canceled because the space shuttle @entity24 exploded just two days after the january 1986 victory			1
the nation went into mourning over the seven - member crew 's deaths			0
the @entity3 posted a 15 - 1 record that season and are regarded as one of the most dominant teams to win the @entity35			2
what endeared the team to many fans , however , were the team 's colorful personalities -- perhaps too colorful because the @entity3 never became the dynasty that many had expected			2
an attendee list was n't immediately available , but the 1985 team roster included such prominent members as coach @entity46 , whose @entity48 provincialism inspired a " @entity50 " skit with catchphrases such as " @entity52 " and " @entity53 " delivered in ice - hard @entity16 accents ; @entity55 , often dubbed the " punk quarterback ; " the 350 - pound - plus lineman @entity57 " @entity58 ; and erstwhile all - time @entity8 rushing leader @entity59 , who died of cancer in 1999			0
considered a die - hard @entity3 fan , the president said it was difficult to host the @entity64 at the @entity2 in august to celebrate their @entity35 victory last february			1
bears vs. @entity64 is one of the @entity8 's most intense rivalries			0
both play in the @entity70 , nicknamed the league 's bruising " @entity73 " division			0
" this hurts a little bit			0
this is a hard thing for a @entity3 fan to do			1
it does n't hurt as much as the nfc championship game hurt -- but it still hurts -- you guys coming to my house to rub it in , " @entity14 joked while honoring the @entity64 in august			2
" what are you going to do , go to @entity46 's house next ? " the @entity3 lost to @entity64 in the nfc championship game last season , and the @entity64 advanced to the @entity35 .			0

the @entity89 will visit the @entity2 on october 7
oh , by the way , president @entity14 is a @entity3 fan
the *original* @entity22 visit was canceled *due* to the @entity24 explosion
