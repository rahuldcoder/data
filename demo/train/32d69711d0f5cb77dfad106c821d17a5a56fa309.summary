-- between her @entity3 ad and the petition to have her host " @entity6 , " @entity1 has been getting a lot of press lately			1
she 's been in the business since the 1940s , so you can bet @entity12 has a few interesting stories up her sleeve			1
would n't you just love to sit at the kitchen table and eat late - night cheesecake with her ? here are a few of the tales she might tell			2

class of ' 39 ! 2			2
do n't call her @entity24 -- it 's not her name			1
her parents went with " @entity12 " on her 1922 birth certificate because they were n't too keen on any of the other nicknames that can go along with @entity24			1
one of her first gigs was as a disc jockey ( kind of )			2
she was the assistant to @entity35 , who hosted a program called " @entity37 on @entity38 " , a variety show that included playing records just like a radio disc jockey did			2
@entity12 was @entity35 's right - hand woman for a few years in the ' 40s and ended up taking over the show entirely when he left			2
younger viewers know @entity1 mostly from her ditzy role as @entity46 on " @entity47			1
" when our favorite show about sassy elderly women first came on the scene , though , television audiences were most familiar with @entity12 as the tart - tongued , man - hungry @entity54 from " the @entity55			2
" in fact , she was initially offered the role of similarly insatiable @entity58 because of her previous role as @entity60 at the first table reading for the show , @entity61 and @entity12 switched characters to avoid being typecast ( @entity61 had previously played a sweet , na√Øve , @entity46 - type character ) and the rest is tv history			2

she 's been calling the shots since a time when women did n't get to call the shots very often			0
@entity12 received credits as co-creator , producer , and star of the 1952 sitcom " life with @entity24			1
" the show earned @entity12 her first emmy -- outstanding lead actress			1
she would n't see another one until 1975 , when she won for outstanding supporting actress for her role in " the @entity55			1
you probably do n't want to have her over for game night , unless you do n't mind losing			1
in the ' 50s and ' 60s , @entity12 was known as " @entity90 of @entity91 " thanks to her appearances on " password , " " what 's my line , " " to @entity97 , " " @entity98 " and " @entity99			1
in fact , she even married a game show host			1
she met her third husband , password host @entity102 , during a guest appearance			1
if you 're familiar with @entity102 , you know he later started his shows with the trademark phrase , " hi , @entity109			1
" this was his little nod to @entity12 's mom , @entity112 , who was an avid watcher			0
@entity12 and @entity102 were married from 1963 until his death in 1981			1
she might seem sweet , but @entity1 has a wicked sense of humor			1
when fellow golden girl @entity117 was hospitalized after having a stroke earlier this year , a friend of @entity61 's reported that @entity12 had sent a " do n't get well " card that said something along the lines of , " @entity61 , i hope you hurry up and die so i can be the last @entity117 left			0

despite all her success in the television and film industries , @entity12 has said that when her time comes , she would rather be remembered for her work with animals and animal - related charities			0
but do n't call her an activist ! here 's what she has to say about that : " i do n't get into the political side or the demonstrative side			0
i 'm just totally devoted to health and welfare			0
you know what the problem that animal activists sometimes have ? they only concentrate on the heartbreaking things to the point where the general public think , ' oh , here comes those animal folks again and i 'm going to hear all the things i do n't want to hear			0
' they forget to celebrate all the gains that we 've made			0
... sure , there are still big problems , but we 're making some good moves			0
