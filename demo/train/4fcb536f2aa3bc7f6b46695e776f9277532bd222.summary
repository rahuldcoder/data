@entity0 , @entity1 the world 's fourth-most populated country , @entity1 has about 250 million people			1
any of them might have boarded @entity7 , never to come home			1
seven crew members and 155 passengers were aboard -- almost one - third from the same @entity12 denomination			1
there was no single reason that members of @entity16 , a @entity18 faith with about 45,000 members around @entity1 , got on the @entity7 @entity21 plane sunday , beyond a common desire to get to @entity23 in time for @entity24			1
they were n't heading to one event			2
they did n't all necessarily know one another , having attended services at different churches mostly around @entity0 , the @entity1 city where the commercial airliner took off			1
still , their religion tied them together			2
and pastor @entity33 says he hopes that those shared beliefs help their loved ones cope now , as the search for more crash victims continues in the @entity38			1
as @entity33 says , " we 're putting trust in @entity42 's hands			0
" pastor : ' put our trust ' in @entity42 's will about 50 people with relatives on @entity7 spent part of friday afternoon inside a special church for police officers in @entity0			1
it was n't a @entity16 church ; it was chosen because it 's near the hospital where recovered bodies are being identified			1
but it served the same purpose : to allow the grieving to congregate , to reflect and to voice their beliefs			0
so they did , holding their hands high at times , holding each other 's hands in prayers at others			0
they sang , the anguish in their faces starkly evident			0
afterward , church members preferred not to talk to reporters			1
but @entity33 , who is a pastor to some of those on @entity74 , did			2
he acknowledges the struggles these @entity16 members , not to mention scores of other families , are facing			1
they may not understand why the plane went down			2
they may have trouble waiting for definitive word that their loved ones have been recovered , if that ever happens			0
and , despite their fervent faith , they might not grasp @entity42 's role in all of it			0
@entity33 says , " some things that happen in our lives , sometimes we just do n't understand what @entity42 really intends			0
" that does n't mean they lose faith			0
according to the pastor , " we just put our trust -- everything , completely -- in his will			2
because he 's going to bring everything ( that is ) the best in our life			0
" @entity2 's @entity104 reported from @entity0 , as did @entity2 's @entity105			0
