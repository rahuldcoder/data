-- @entity1 says he 's never going to see @entity5 's " @entity4 " because he 's certain it is " disrespectful of my ancestors			1
" @entity5 says he does n't need to waste time responding to @entity1 's accusation			1
that , as they say , is that			0
so why do we insist on staring at two egomaniacs staring down each other ? race			0
the subject that never fails to provoke , antagonize , alienate -- and fascinate rubber - necking onlookers from sea to shining sea			0
fixating on race is an absurdity that has no rational reason to exist , yet no one quite knows how to eliminate it from humankind			0
the only thing dumber than race is underestimating its importance			0
" @entity4 " is @entity5 's latest exercise in genre - bending audacity , an antic ripsnorter folding in most of what its director knows and loves about spaghetti westerns , 1970s blaxploitation thrillers and his own ribald , recklessly violent body of work			1
its title character , played by @entity38 , is a slave bought and freed by a drolly effective @entity41 bounty hunter ( @entity40 ) , who agrees to help @entity42 emancipate his wife , @entity43 ( @entity44 ) , from a decadent plantation owner ( @entity45 )			0
" @entity42 " makes no pretense of being anything other than a phantasmagoric pseudo-western , rife with calculated vulgarity , anachronism and impropriety			0
its body count rivals that of @entity5 's 2003 martial - arts epic , " @entity54 " ( to whose messily operatic set pieces of slaughter " @entity42 " bears an uncanny resemblance )			1
@entity59 blog : what 's the verdict on " @entity62 " ? the movie has so far grossed more than $ 100 million since its @entity65 nationwide release			0
critics ' reactions have ranged from wild - eyed enthusiasm ( the @entity70 's @entity69 : " @entity71 , inside - out , upside - down , simultaneously clear - eyed and out of its mind " ) to wary detachment ( the @entity75 ' @entity74 : " ( @entity76 ) ou may leave ... wishing for both more and less " ) to borderline outrage ( @entity80 's @entity79 : " there 's something about ( @entity5 's ) directorial delectation in all these acts of racial violence that left me not just physically , but morally queasy			1
" ) given advance hype for the movie as extravagant as its violence , i doubt that audience members , whatever their race or age , bought tickets with the expectation of seeing some historically faithful saga of antebellum life , and neither did i. we were buying a comic book			2
many people have a grievance against the very notion of comic books , but i do n't			2
expect a movie or a comic book to explain everything about anything and all you earn is surplus sadness that you do n't really need			1
nevertheless , there are many who , unlike @entity1 , have seen the movie and carry the same grievances as he does			2
the most scathing attack came from that novelist - satirist - poet @entity115 , writing in @entity116 : " to compare this movie to a spaghetti western and a blaxploitation film is an insult to both genres			2
it 's a @entity5 home movie with all the racist licks of his other movies			1
" he aimed this laser shot at the @entity127 - nominated actor who plays the treacherous " house slave " to @entity45 's character : " @entity130 ... plays himself			2
" i doubt @entity130 felt the blow			0
he has , in fact , further provoked the movie 's antagonists by running straight at an interviewer asking about the movie 's prolific use of the " n - word , " refusing to answer the question unless the reporter , who is white , actually says the dread epithet aloud			1
) still , @entity115 's condemnation discloses what may lie at the heart of @entity1 's objection : the debate over whether white artists have the right to tell any part of the black @entity152 story -- which , as @entity115 writes , is as old as @entity154 's 1852 abolitionist novel , " @entity155			1
" it is also as recent as 1967 when the white @entity160 novelist @entity159 published , " @entity164 , " a @entity157 - winning novel told in the first - person voice of the brilliant - but - doomed leader of an 1838 slave rebellion			0
the outcry from @entity152 novelists was so intense that a collection of essays , " @entity159 's @entity167 : ten black writers respond " was published a year later			1
@entity174 , a friend of @entity159 's who was one of the few @entity152 - @entity152 authors speaking out on the book 's behalf , put his position as succinctly as possible : " i will not tell another writer what to write			1
if you do n't like their alternative , write yours			2
" it 's still sound advice -- and in the intervening years , black authors have taken it , from @entity186 's 1976 blockbuster , " roots , " to @entity188 's haunting " @entity187 " from 1987			1
both were adapted for the screen , and while " roots , " the television miniseries , delivered a resounding national impact , the 1998 movie adaptation of " beloved , " even with @entity195 as producer and co-star , earned about $ 26 million , roughly half of its $ 50 million budget			0
i remember many of my @entity152 - @entity152 relatives and friends who told me they were not going to see " @entity187 , " no matter how good it was or who was in it , because they simply did not want to watch a movie about slavery 's legacy			1
some of these same folks , on the other hand , tell me they were psyched about seeing a movie , however " incorrect " on several levels , in which a black ex-slave secures freedom for his wife , kills every white man who stands in his way -- and gets away with it			0
exasperated ? if you 're not , you should be			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			0

@entity226 : @entity1 , @entity5 *spatting* over " @entity4 "
@entity226 says film , which *upends* slavery narrative , is *classic* comic - book @entity5
he says debate is over whether white artists have right to tell any part of black @entity152 story
@entity226 notes @entity174 's sound advice : " if you do n't like their alternative , write yours "
