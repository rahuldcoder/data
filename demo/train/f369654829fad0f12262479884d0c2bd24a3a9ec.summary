-- it 's fun to imagine what @entity3 ' studio must look like : you would assume that the @entity8 - based artist 's workspace has to resemble the lab of a harebrained entomologist , with test tubes , specimen bags and pushpins strewn about			1
in reality , of course , to create the startlingly elaborate sculptural portraits @entity18 is known for , he has to be much more organized than that			1
" it does take a fairly high degree of organization , " assures me			0
" but that 's not the hardest part			0
" take a glance through @entity18 ' work , and you 'll understand what he means			1
technically , @entity18 is a portraitist , though he rarely uses paint			2
instead , the artist recreates the human visage by arranging fragments of a person 's life — photographs , locks of hair , handwriting samples , jewelry — into highly detailed works of art. read more : seven hand gestures that make you look like a real intellectual @entity18 has been making these pieces for years , generally working with subjects intimately close to him			1
but in his newest project , he 's decided to deconstruct ( then reconstruct ) some of the @entity55 ' most famous 17th century portraits , rendering classics like @entity58 's painting of @entity59 into startling franken - portraits			1
each of @entity18 ' pieces are constructed from what he describes as " biographical dna , " the little pieces of physical information he pieces together to create a finished portrait			1
typically , this is a fairly simple process with @entity18 gathering his photos , bits of hair , and handwriting samples from his living subject 's home and then organizing them into a portrait using test tubes , little baggies or pushpins			1
with the @entity55 series , he had to be a bit more resourceful			2
@entity18 begins each portrait by downloading copyright - free images from various museums ' websites			1
from there , he crops each image , zeroing in on certain features like an eyeball , fingertip or face before printing out dozens of each			0
" i 'm occasionally reminded that i 'm not a typical customer when the manager walks the envelope of prints out to me personally with a curious eye , " he says			0

" i tend to produce hundreds and hundreds of samples before i start working with the actual composition , " he explains			0
" in this way , i can work more intuitively in the composition , again , with the spirit of a painter — in a lab coat , so to speak			0
" the process of gathering these bits of biographical dna is an attempt to form some sort of cohesive picture about what the final portrait should look like			2
" i generally tape a number of photos on the wall and ponder where to go from there , " he says			0
of course , @entity18 ' final portrait is going to look a lot like the original , only with a much more of an artistically rendered shrine vibe			2
there are clever and nuanced departures from the 17th - century versions			1
for example , one thing you notice about the @entity55 ' portraits is how utterly pg they are			1
women are shrouded in black , their necks even fully covered			0
" these subjects were surely well known to the artists who painted them , " says @entity3			2
" imagine the restraint required of @entity58 in not including a bit of @entity152 's legs			2
" read more : wildly detailed drawings that combine math and butterflies at a distance , @entity18 ' work echoes the puritanical rigidity of the @entity55 , but when you get up close and really examine what his sculptural paintings are made of you 'll notice photographs of bare legs and bits of cleavage filling out the skin tone of the @entity55 ' subjects			1
@entity18 has even incorporated locks of hair			1
all this is an attempt to shift our perspectives , and hopefully inspire us to re-examine how we perceive what 's around us			0
" my hope , " he says			0
" is that it encourages different ways of processing and interpreting what and how we look at things — art , science or anything			0
