editor 's note : @entity2 is a senior fellow at the @entity3 , a libertarian public policy research foundation			1
he formerly worked at @entity5 and as an economist for @entity8 sen. @entity7 and the @entity9			0
he also served on the 1988 @entity11 transition team			0
@entity2 says an auto bailout would subsidize bad management and reward inflexible unions			1
( @entity15 ) -- @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and the @entity19 are pouring millions of dollars into a lobbying campaign for a taxpayer bailout			2
the money devoted to influence peddling in @entity23 would be better spent on improving quality and finding ways to reduce a bloated cost structure , but both management and @entity19 have decided that fleecing taxpayers is a better option			2
a taxpayer bailout would be a terrible mistake			2
it would subsidize the shoddy management practices of the corporate bureaucrats at @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , and it would reward the intransigent union bosses who have made the synonymous with inflexible and anti-competitive work rules			1
perhaps most important , though , is that a bailout would be bad for the long - term health of the @entity40 auto industry			1
it would discriminate against the 113,000 @entity40 who have highly - coveted jobs building cars for @entity44 , @entity45 and other auto companies that happen to be headquartered in other nations			1
these companies demonstrate that it is possible to build cars in @entity40 and make money			1
putting them at a competitive disadvantage with handouts for the @entity40 - headquartered companies would be highly unjust			1
a bailout also would be bad for @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			2
the so - called @entity56 desperately need to fundamentally restructure their practices			1
more specifically , the car companies need to endure some short - term pain in order to restore long - term viability			2
but that wo n't happen if politicians raid the treasury			0
getting access to taxpayer money would be akin to giving an alcoholic the key to a liquor cabinet			0
it also would be bad for @entity40 taxpayers and the @entity40 economy			1
for instance : a bailout will hurt the overall economy by misallocating resources			2
when politicians grant special favors to a certain industry or a particular union , such decisions necessarily mean that market forces are being replaced by special - interest deal - making			2
this type of interference with free markets is why nations such as @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 tend to grow more slowly and enjoy less prosperity			0
but if @entity40 goes down this same path of government intervention , it is inevitable that we will suffer the same fate of stagnation and higher unemployment			1
a bailout will encourage other industries to seek taxpayer handouts			2
the @entity103 bailout was a disaster in many ways , most notably as measured by the weak stock market and economic volatility			0
but another negative aspect of the bailout is that other industries have now decided that it is ok to stick their snouts in the public trough , as well			0
@entity115 's high fliers get a bailout			0
now the inefficient management and union at the @entity56 want a handout			1
who will be next in line to pillage taxpayers ? giving handouts in exchange for political support is akin to getting high			0
once politicians decide they like the buzz of campaign contributions , they 'll turn into junkies with ordinary @entity40 footing the bill			1
a bailout is a perverse transfer from poor taxpayers to rich taxpayers			0
@entity40 's @entity136 surely never envisaged that the federal government would take money from one group of @entity40 and give it to another group			1
yet much of the federal budget is devoted to redistribution programs			0
bailouts are a particularly bizarre form of redistribution , however , because the corporate bureaucrats at the @entity56 are among the very richest @entity40			1
the @entity19 bosses make extravagant salaries , as well , and even regular union workers make an average total compensation including benefits of approximately $ 70 per hour , far higher than the average @entity40			1
the government should not be in the business of giving unearned wealth to any group of citizens , but surely liberals and conservatives both can agree that politicians should not be taking money from middle class taxpayers and giving it to upper - middle class and rich taxpayers			0
advocates oftentimes admit that bailouts are not good policy , but they invariably argue that short - term considerations should trump long - term sensible policy			0
their biggest assertion is that a bailout is necessary to prevent bankruptcy , and that avoiding this result is critical to prevent catastrophe			1
but chapter 11 protection may be precisely what is needed to put @entity40 auto companies back on the path to profitability			1
bankruptcy laws specifically are designed to give companies an opportunity - under court supervision - to reduce costs and streamline operations			1
@entity186 would not be popular in some quarters , to be sure			0
the bloated management structure would be streamlined and many overpaid executives would be unhappy about having to find new jobs			1
the @entity19 would be equally upset , particularly since bankruptcy might force an end to extravagant pension benefits and inefficient workplace practices			0
but bankruptcy is akin to getting an alcoholic to put down the bottle			0
there clearly will be short - term discomfort , but compassionate people recognize that this is the best approach			0
@entity40 is on a dangerous path			2
the @entity103 bailout was a mistake			0
it transferred a huge amount of money from the productive sector of the economy to the government , and also exacerbated " moral hazard " by rewarding companies and executives who made dumb decisions			0
but this may be the tip of the iceberg			0
a bailout of @entity40 - headquartered auto companies also would be a mistake , as would bailouts of homeowners or any other constituency			1
if politicians genuinely want to help the economy , they should focus on reducing the burden of government , not increasing it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : bailing out the @entity56 would reward shoddy management
a bailout would be unfair to other auto companies making cars in the @entity40 , he says
@entity2 says auto execs , workers and unions are overpaid
bankruptcy would let the companies streamline their operations , @entity2 says
