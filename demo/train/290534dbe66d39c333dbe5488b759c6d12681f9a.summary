perhaps it was a foregone conclusion , what with the @entity3 's proven ability to turn any new technology into a platform for showing naked people			0
but @entity8 's new video - sharing app , @entity9 , is under scrutiny after early adopters started using it to flash six - second porn clips to the app 's users and to the larger @entity8 community			1
it 's an issue that has @entity8 scrambling to appease concerns			2
and it 's raising questions about how @entity19 , the only place where smartphone users can download the app , will respond after recently banning other apps that provide access to sexual content			1
the issue gained attention monday when @entity9 users noticed a video of what was described as hard - core pornography showcased in the prominent editor 's @entity33 section of the mobile app. users took to the comment section of that video to complain			1
@entity8 apologized monday , saying it was a mistake			0
" a human error resulted in a video with adult content becoming one of the videos in @entity34 's picks , and upon realizing this mistake we removed the video immediately , " the company said in a statement sent to @entity48			1
" we apologize to our users for the error			0
" released thursday , @entity9 is a @entity8 - owned app that lets users create and share videos lasting up to six seconds			1
as with photo - sharing app @entity57 , @entity9 users can follow other people , whose posted videos show up in a feed on their phones or can be shared on @entity8 and @entity63			1
the app is available only for the @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity65			0
@entity9 's @entity19 - only status raises interesting questions			1
just last week , @entity19 banned image - sharing app 500px from its @entity71 because it could give users access to sexual content			1
the 500px app features artistically rendered nudes among lots of other photos , but so do other apps with user - generated content , such as @entity80 , which remain available on @entity19 's @entity82 mobile system			1
the @entity9 app is rated 12 + on @entity84 for " infrequent / mild sexual content or nudity , " among other reasons , meaning it 's deemed appropriate for users 12 or older			1
as of monday , it was the fifth most popular free app in the @entity71			0
@entity19 did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment for this story			0
@entity9 had been listed on @entity19 's own editor 's choice list as early as monday morning , but appeared to have been removed by monday afternoon			1
@entity19 observers monday were noting the strange position the company finds itself in			0
@entity19 has famously kept tight reins on what appears in its @entity71 and on its mobile operating system in general			0
the late ceo @entity101 famously argued that control on the front end delivers a user experience free from porn , spam and other digital unpleasantness			0
but as the digital web grows and evolves , it 's becoming tougher to parse the blurry line between apps that promote adult content ( and which are turned down or banned by @entity19 as a matter of course ) and those which simply provide access to such fare			1
what , for example , is the distinction between the banned 500px app and the app for @entity80 , the blogging platform which , among its millions of blogs , includes many that host explicit sexual content ? " from the start , @entity19 has said they 'd get the @entity71 wrong , and come across things they did n't anticipate , but that they 'd learn and grow , " said @entity127 , editor of @entity19 - centric blog @entity128 , in a post monday			1
" this particular problem has been around for years , but as social sharing has become easier , it 's come to the surface again			0
" interestingly , it was just a little less than a year ago that @entity19 banned @entity140 , a video - sharing app that has been compared to @entity9 , because it gave access to user - generated adult videos			1
the @entity145 app was eventually returned to the @entity71			0
on @entity8 's end , the anything - goes aspect of @entity9 jibes with the site 's overall philosophy			1
compared to @entity63 , which believes social sharing is best when tied to a user 's true identity and real - world networks , @entity8 allows its users to register under fake names and has fought governments and law - enforcement agencies seeking user information			2
as such , @entity8 has taken a more hands - off approach on adult content			2
it 's not hard to hunt down hashtags its users are employing to share adult content on a daily basis			2
( # @entity167 becomes a trending topic on the site nearly every day -- clicker beware )			0
by contrast , searching for several suggestive hashtags ( such as # naked or # porn ) on @entity57 , the popular photo - sharing app bought by @entity63 last year , render no results			2
because @entity57 is an @entity19 - like closed environment , sexually explicit images are difficult , if not impossible , to find there			0
by monday afternoon , hours after @entity9 had apologized and deleted the porn video from its @entity33 , what uproar there was online was subsiding			1
as some observers noted , @entity9 is n't otherwise experiencing anything new in the tech world			0
" as virtually every new video or photo - sharing service has shown us since the dawn of the @entity3 , from @entity190 to @entity191 , it 's very difficult to keep these sites or apps g - rated			2
so the companies either learn how to police it well , like @entity190 does , or they wither and die , as @entity191 did , " wrote @entity195 's @entity194 in a post titled " @entity9 has a porn problem because , of course it does			2
" in a statement to @entity48 , @entity8 noted what had already become apparent on the app -- that users can report videos they deem inappropriate			2
" videos that have been reported as inappropriate have a warning message that a viewer must click through before viewing the video , " a spokesperson said in the statement			0
reported videos that are determined to violate @entity9 guidelines will be removed from the site and the user account that posted them may be terminated , according to the statement			0
@entity9 's terms of service ban illegal activity , harassment or abuse and behavior such as impersonating another user or violating trademark and copyright .			0

an error led to a porn video being listed as an editor 's pick in @entity8 's new @entity9 app
@entity9 lets users shoot and post six - second videos from their phones
@entity8 lets users flag *offensive* content , which gives other users a heads - up
@entity9 is only available from @entity19 , which has banned other apps over sexual content
