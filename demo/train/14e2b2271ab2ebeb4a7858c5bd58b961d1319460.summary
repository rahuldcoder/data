-- from fighting common colds to cancer , @entity2 herbal medicines have long been touted for their healing properties			0
but this week , environmental group @entity6 says it found many herbs purchased from @entity2 and @entity9 retail stores contain alarming levels of harmful pesticides			1
one herb , a sample of @entity15 flower purchased from popular chain @entity17 , contained over 500 times the @entity19 safety limit of a restricted pesticide			1
another herb contained over 100 times that limit , according to the report			1
@entity17 @entity25 did not return calls for comment			0
of the 65 herbs sampled by @entity6 , 51 contained pesticides with 26 having chemicals classified as " extremely or highly hazardous " by the @entity32 , it said			1
" these herbs are of doubtful quality and not safe to consume , " said @entity33 , a @entity6 project leader			1
the pesticides pose significant risks for consumers and farmers , @entity6 said			1
" we found some old , obsolete pesticides , with highly hazardous chemicals			1
even a tiny dose can result in acute toxicity or sickness , " said @entity33			0
" other pesticides can affect our immune system or hormones , and some may have an impact on children 's brain development			0
" this is not the first time @entity2 has experienced a pesticide - related food scandal			0
in 2010 , batches of cowpeas in @entity58 province tested positive for a highly toxic pesticide , according to state media			1
last month , an investigation by @entity62 ( @entity62 ) found that farmers in @entity65 province were using " three to six times " the recommended level of pesticides on ginger crops			2
according to @entity6 , @entity2 uses more pesticides than any other country in the world			1
@entity33 said the @entity2 government has " no regulation or guidance " regarding the use of pesticides with herbal crops			0
" we want government agencies to strengthen the control , monitoring , and guidance of pesticide use , " she said			0
" the @entity9 government has more standards than the mainland , but it 's still not enough , " she added			2
dr. @entity89 , an expert on pesticides at the @entity91 , said that @entity9 generally has " adequate safeguards " to protect consumers from pesticides in food			1

@entity105 said pesticide levels that exceed standards set by the @entity19 " do not automatically indicate imminent health risk to consumers			2
" conclusions about risks can not be drawn without taking into account consumers ' " level of intake and consumption frequency , " she added			0
in a statement , the @entity9 @entity118 said , " the @entity118 ( dh ) is concerned about the findings released by @entity6			1
@entity118 is requesting @entity6 to provide us with the full report for detail study			1
in particular , there is lack of information on the testing methods , testing standards and the testing laboratory which are needed to conduct an appropriate risk assessment			0
" " the dh has also in place a market surveillance system to obtain @entity2 herbal medicine samples to test the levels of pesticide residues and heavy metals , " it added			0
" so far no abnormal results have been detected from the decocted @entity2 medicine samples			0
" the @entity2 @entity140 did not respond to requests for comment			0
meanwhile , @entity105 offered a simple piece of advice : " in general , the level of pesticide residues in a crop commodity will be reduced substantially following washing and processing : boiling in particular			2

@entity6 : of 65 herbs tested , 26 contained " highly hazardous " pesticides
@entity6 : one herb contained over 500 times @entity156 safe limit of pesticide
