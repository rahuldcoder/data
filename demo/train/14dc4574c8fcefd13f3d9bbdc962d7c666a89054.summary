the delight of my eyes			2
" so says a poem inscribed in cuneiform on a lump of clay approximately 4,000 years ago			0
why does love inspire such works of art ? recent science points to a possible answer -- and a difference between the way the brain reacts to love and lust			0
last year psychologists in the @entity20 reported on a study where they asked a group of young men and women to imagine taking a long walk with their beloved ( those without a partner imagined taking a walk with an " ideal " one )			1
a different set of volunteers were asked to imagine having casual sex with someone they found attractive but were not in love with			1
before and after , both groups were given a battery of tests to examine their creative and analytical abilities			1
the results : thinking about a romantic partner stimulated " global processing " mechanisms in the brain , which increased long - term focus and improved creativity			1
thinking about sex , on the other hand , stimulated " local processing , " which increased focus on the present and heightened analytical thinking			1
@entity0 : tap into your right - brain thinking there may be a physiological explanation for these results			1
feelings of romantic love can boost levels of dopamine , a neurochemical associated with creativity , while sexual desire can raise levels of testosterone , known to promote analytical skills			2
and these chemical links may have evolved for an important purpose : increasing the likelihood of sexual reproduction			0
in ancestral days , creative individuals may have used their inventiveness to attract future mates , while sex - focused individuals harnessed analytical clarity and short - term focus in order to bed a partner here and now			1
thoughts of either love or sex could pay off in the form of children -- the ultimate measure of survival			2
while we no longer use cave drawings to attract our partners , you can still take advantage of this evolutionary link			2
daydreaming about your sweetheart may boost inventiveness and help you come up with creative ideas , while sexual thoughts could help you solve an analytical puzzle			1
@entity0 : how to fix whatever 's broken in addition , it may be that jilted lovers who want to get over an ex faster would be better off replacing thoughts of what might have been with sexual fantasies			0
this might just help refocus your attention on the present -- and on the steps you need to take to rebuild , so that one day you 'll be ready to write love notes again			0
