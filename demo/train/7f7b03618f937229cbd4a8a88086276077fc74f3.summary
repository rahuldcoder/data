-- watching the post parade at this weekend 's @entity2 will surely fill some of our heads with dreams of horse ownership			2
how did the julep - sipping folks acquire their prized horses ? how much is buying a racehorse going to set you back ? are they sound investments ? these are all tricky questions , but let 's take a look at a few stories of horse sales that turned out to be winning lottery tickets ... and a few that were more dud than stud			1
mr. @entity21 becomes a daddy again and again in 1971 , mr. @entity21 was a yearling that fetched $ 200,000 at auction			1
when he took to the track , he was good but not great ; he won seven of 14 starts but only brought home $ 112,170 during his career			1
still , in 1980 he sold for $ 20 million			1
what happened ? it turns out " mr. @entity34 " was a stud in every sense of the word			1
while his racing career might not have been the most distinguished , it 's tough to argue with his results as a stud			2
he sired a winner of each of the @entity45 races , and his grandchildren and great - grandchildren have been similarly speedy			2
his sons , grandsons , and great - grandsons have combined to win over 30 @entity45 races and pull in around $ 100 million in earnings			1
mr. @entity54 's @entity2 - winning son @entity53 fetched $ 60 million in 2000 , and 18 years earlier , another son -- @entity57 winner @entity56 -- sold for $ 36.4 million			1
@entity0 : did famous horses get their names ? @entity60 drives steel , wins cash when @entity60 , a yearling foaled in 1975 , came up for bids at the @entity65 january mixed sale , he did n't generate much buzz			0
he had fairly mundane bloodlines , he was n't particularly big , and he had a nasty temper -- he got his name from a tendency of smashing steel feed buckets			2
@entity73 bought the unheralded gelding for a modest $ 1,100 investment and hoped he could make a little cash back on the horse			1
how did it work out ? by the time @entity60 retired from racing , he was the top - earning gelding in history with over $ 6.5 million in career earnings			1
he won 25 graded stakes races and was racehorse of the decade for the 1980s			2
not a shabby return on a $ 1,100 investment			0
the @entity88 makes a monkey out of bidders unless you 're a huge fan of the band @entity93 , you might not envision shelling out eight figures for a horse with no name			1
that 's exactly what happened in a january 2006 auction at @entity100 , though			0
when the auctioneers brought a colt who was only known as " number 153 " to the auction block , a fierce bidding war broke out			0
buyers were n't afraid to open their wallets for a colt that was described as " perfect , " and when the hammer dropped the horse went for a record $ 16 million			1
the winning bidders quickly christened the colt @entity114 , and excitement to see how the horse would do in races began to build			0
after all , the colt had run an eighth of a mile in a blazing 9.8 seconds in pre-auction workouts , so anything was possible once he started racing			0
the buyers thought they were getting a @entity45 threat			0
instead they got the thoroughbred version of @entity126			0
the @entity88 could never translate his workout speed into actual races , and in his career , he only managed one third - place finish in a measly three starts			1
in 2008 , his owners retired him from racing to stand at stud			0
if his progeny enjoy the success that eluded the @entity88 , he might make some of his substantial purchase price back			1
it will be tough , though ; right now he only pulls in $ 5,000 as a stud fee			2
@entity0 : 7 things to know about the @entity2 ... but he 's in good company the @entity88 should n't feel too bad			2
the horses he took the " most expensive colt " record from did n't fare much better			0
@entity146 set the yearling price record in 1985 when he went for a cool $ 13.1 million before going on to win $ 150,000 in his five career starts			0
@entity151 's sale in 1983 was the worst investment this side of @entity155 stock ; the first yearling to break the $ 10 million price mark never raced -- and was infertile			0
cigar comes up empty even casual sports fans may remember @entity160 , the bay stallion who racked up an incredible 16 straight wins from 1994 to 1996			0
if @entity160 had picked up just $ 187 more during his career , he would have become the first horse ever to break $ 10 million in race earnings			1
when the former @entity168 came up for sale in 1998 , there were more than a few breeders who wanted to get their hands on him			0
cigar sold for $ 25 million and promptly went out to stud to recoup some of that cash			1
that 's when breeders discovered a problem : the horse that some analysts called " the second - best racehorse ever " was infertile			2
@entity160 's new owners got a record $ 25 million payout on an insurance policy that covered infertility , and the champion stallion is spending the autumn of his years at the @entity190 's @entity189			0
@entity0 : 7 strange stories of lost cell phones			0

mr. @entity21 only won $ 112,170 , but the race horse fathered a some big winners
the @entity88 sold for $ *16m* but his best was a third - place finish
cigar won almost $ *10m* , but turned out to be a big loser as a stud
