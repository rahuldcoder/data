-- in six days , the @entity3 government 's borrowing authority will be exhausted			1
if @entity5 does not act to extend the debt limit , the @entity4 will be left with only its cash on hand -- estimated to be about $ 30 billion -- and whatever revenues it takes in each day			0
because the government is running a deficit , available cash will be insufficient to cover the millions of payments the @entity4 makes each day -- to men and women in our armed forces , veterans , @entity21 and @entity22 beneficiaries , federal employees and retirees , businesses that provide goods and services to the nation , and many others			1
even if @entity5 opts to pass a temporary extension , the threat of default will hang over the economy until a longer - term solution is adopted			1
what does this really mean for the economy , and what does it mean for you ? @entity5 has never in our history failed to extend the debt limit , so no one knows for sure what would happen if , as some @entity46 are now advocating , we tried to operate the government with insufficient funds and no ability to borrow			1
it has long been the view of economists , business leaders and the @entity4 that such a scenario could set in motion a financial crisis			1
presidents and @entity57 of both parties have urged @entity5 never to take that risk			0
@entity60 himself once said , " unfortunately , @entity5 consistently brings the government to the edge of default before facing its responsibility			1
this brinkmanship threatens the holders of government bonds and those who rely on @entity21 and veterans benefits			2
interest rates would skyrocket , instability would occur in financial markets , and the federal deficit would soar			2
the @entity3 has a special responsibility to itself and the world to meet its obligations			2
it means we have a well - earned reputation for reliability and credibility , two things that set us apart from much of the world			2
" @entity60 's view is widely held , but some republicans -- dubbed " default deniers " -- now argue that the debt limit deadline can be ignored without serious harm			1
they have urged the president to continue paying interest on the national debt using available cash and then avoid or delay paying other obligations			0
although it 's not possible to disprove either theory , the default deniers overlook an important problem : paying interest on the debt would not protect the @entity4 against what 's called " rollover risk			1
" that 's the risk that investors would decide , amid the crisis atmosphere generated by a failure to raise the debt limit , to cash out their maturing @entity4 bonds instead of reinvesting ( or " rolling over " ) their proceeds into new @entity110 , as they usually do			2
this would be reminiscent of the famous bank scene at the end of " @entity114 , " only on a huge and frightening scale			0
about $ 100 billion in treasury securities mature each week , so if investors decided to put their money elsewhere , @entity4 's available cash would be nowhere near enough to cash those jittery investors out			0
in those circumstances , the @entity3 would default on both principal and interest payments , and the economic consequences would be swift and severe			1
to the extent that we were able to continue borrowing , investors would demand higher interest rates on @entity110			0
( these rates have already begun to rise as the impasse in @entity130 has worsened			0
) since @entity4 rates are benchmarks for other lending , loans for homes , cars and other needs would become more expensive , and it would become harder to qualify to borrow			0
consumer and business confidence would suffer			0
as in the last financial crisis , falling confidence would have ripple effects , affecting other markets including the short - term lending used by companies to finance themselves			1
this would all dampen economic growth , which is still not as strong as we would like in the wake of the last crisis			0
the stock market would weaken , and retirement savings would dip			1
and of course unemployment would rise			0
meanwhile , the inability to pay the rest of the government 's regular obligations in full or on time would be spreading its own hardship across the economy			1
there is no way to know how bad these conditions would get or how far the financial contagion would spread , but it seems safe to say that no good could come from tempting such a fate			0
the question is : why in the world would we ever choose to take that risk ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			2

in six days , the @entity3 government 's borrowing authority will be exhausted
@entity180 : a @entity3 default could set in motion a financial crisis of global scale
