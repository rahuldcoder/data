" @entity44 explained that @entity9 's digital preservation of @entity13 silent films is an example of how film preservation itself has changed , especially in the last 10 years			1
" it used to be that you preserved on film but now we have a multitude of ways , including making digital copies so that the images are preserved			0
" included in the restored movies is a 1923 film staring then - child - star @entity70 , called " @entity72 , " about a boy who runs away from his uncle to join the circus ; and " @entity78 , " starring @entity77 movie star @entity76			0
