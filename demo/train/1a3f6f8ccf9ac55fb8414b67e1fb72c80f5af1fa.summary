-- at the heart of a $ 600 million complex of @entity5 condominium and office towers , a network of holes in the ground has provided new insight into the people who were there first			1
the holes lay out the foundations of a prehistoric settlement of the ancient @entity15 tribe at the confluence of the @entity17 and @entity18			2
the @entity15 lived in what 's now metro @entity5 until the 1700s , and the holes held pine posts that framed their thatched buildings			1
" we got to the point in recent months where we realized this was n't an isolated circle or structure but a whole complex of buildings , " said archaeologist @entity23 , whose company was hired to conduct a historical analysis of the building site			1
the settlement is likely to have been home to hundreds of people , perhaps as many as 1,000			0
" in some ways , i would say it 's probably the best - preserved prehistoric town plan in eastern @entity40 , " @entity23 said			1
since october , his team has unearthed several thousand holes carved into the limestone that makes up @entity5 's bedrock			2
in addition to the circular layouts , the team found linear structures @entity23 said may have been boardwalks for the waterfront settlement			0
the site also houses the foundations of the @entity53 , one of the resorts built by legendary @entity57 developer @entity56 in the late 19th century			2
but the post holes and various pieces of pottery recovered at the site over the years date back to 500 - 600 @entity62 , @entity23 said			0
the discovery means a new hurdle for the @entity5 complex , which is nearing completion after more than a decade of work			1
the site is slated to house @entity5 , a residential / retail building with a movie theater , but city officials still have to sign off on the final plans			1
" this is the last element of a very extensive downtown development project , all of which has been hugely successful , " said @entity73 , a lawyer for the @entity5 developers			1
the developers have proposed cutting out a section of the limestone , rebuilding a @entity15 structure on top of it using the original post holes and putting it on display in @entity5			1
the structure would be paired with a model of the native village based on the layout @entity23 's team has discovered , @entity73 said			0
" the point of it is to create knowledge -- not just to save things but to understand them , " @entity73 said			0
the company 's plan would allow the public to learn more about the site than they would if the site were simply preserved as is , as another @entity15 site nearby -- the " @entity101 , " identified in 1998 -- has been , he said			2
but the plans will need to be approved by @entity5 's @entity103 , which meets on february 14 , and then the @entity104			2
@entity5 " is a critical element of the entire plan , and the developer needs to meet the schedule , " @entity73 said			1
" it 's already been delayed for the years it took to do this analysis , and it 's time here to move on			0
" @entity114 of the @entity115 and @entity116 told @entity118 affiliate @entity117 he is concerned that the historic integrity of the site could be lost , even with the proposal to display a section			1
" if you have a book and you tear out a chapter , you lose the integrity of the book , " he told the station			0
" you might have this part of it , but you lose part of the story			0
" the @entity15 lived in south @entity57 for roughly 2,000 years , @entity23 said			0
but they had disappeared by the time @entity134 took control of @entity57 from the @entity136 in 1763 , with the remnants of their population believed to have migrated to @entity140 , he said			0
8 very old sites in the @entity142 10,000 - year - old house , other ancient finds unearthed			0

@entity5 *dig* lays out " a whole complex of buildings " in a prehistoric town
but they *'re* on the site of a whole new development in the works
developers have proposed preserving a section of the site as part of their project
@entity5 historic preservation officials will *review* the plan next week
