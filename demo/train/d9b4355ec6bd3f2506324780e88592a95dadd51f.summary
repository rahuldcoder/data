@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 delivered to your gate at the touch of a screen ? it sounds too good to be true , but it 's happening at a handful or airports			1
about 7,000 @entity11 are being installed at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 in @entity15 and @entity17 - @entity16 in the @entity18 in a collaboration between airport food and beverage provider @entity20 and @entity21			1
in the @entity21 terminal at @entity18 , @entity11 at seats in the gate areas will give airline customers up - to - the - minute flight updates , as well as free access to the @entity28			1
plus , fliers waiting for their flights can order food from a selection of new restaurants in the terminal and have it delivered to the gate			1
" if i 'm going to spend $ 10 on a beer , i 'd rather do it on an @entity41 , " said @entity37 , who was traveling recently through @entity18 , " because it 's more fun , more exciting			1
" @entity20 has eliminated most of the chain restaurants and fast food options at the @entity1 airport in favor of restaurants with menus designed by chefs from the @entity18 area			1
the same local concept is being applied at @entity52 and @entity53 airports			1
" the goal behind this was to make travel better for travelers , " @entity20 spokesman @entity54 said			0
" you have to get to the airport earlier now with new ( security ) measures , so why not be able to get to your gate , have a fresh meal , a great glass of wine , the convenience of an @entity41 , charging your devices ? it was really just to make the little things better			1
" when the project is completed late next year , @entity17 - @entity0 airport 's @entity71 will play host to 12 unique restaurants			1
each will also have an @entity41 at every seat			0
ipads in the restaurants will offer color photos of each dish and will -- at least for the ordering aspect of your meal -- replace the need for a server			1
hosts still play a role , @entity20 says , and servers will still see that you 're taken carry of after they bring out your cooked order			1
@entity20 chief technology officer @entity93 had his own hesitations about installing the @entity11			1
" there was a lot of fear that this would somehow reduce the customer service experience , " @entity93 said , " but i think people appreciated the ability to order and feel in control of their environment			2
and i think they enjoyed having access to the internet			0
" traveler @entity106 was waiting recently for his flight at @entity18 and used the @entity41 to place an order			1
" the first time i saw it , it was a little odd , " @entity106 said			0
" but i think after you use it once or twice , it 's pretty user - friendly			2
" and he did n't find that the service aspect of the experience suffered			0
many travelers seemed pleased with the changes			0
some said they liked the ability to check stocks or to stay up to speed on their flight departure , and parents said it was nice because pre-loaded games like tic - tac - toe and checkers gave their kids something to do			0
but not everyone shared those sentiments			0
one man who was hurrying to finish his food and catch his flight called it " impersonal			2
" " i prefer the personal touch			0
i like dealing with people , but the service was good , " he added			0
another passenger said the system was a little confusing at first			0
" the first time i ordered a drink , it was a gin and tonic , and i did n't see the tonic , so i ( accidentally ) ordered a double gin			0
i had to actually go back to the bartender to get them to put tonic water in it			0
... but once you get used to it , i think it 's fine			2
" while @entity20 's @entity11 replace the need for servers to take the initial order back to the kitchen , @entity93 insists that it is n't eliminating restaurant jobs			1
they say they 're merely " changing how we deal with service			0
" " instead of waiters coming to take your order and going back and entering things ( in the computer ) ... we now have servers more geared toward our concierge experience			2
" and what about the security of the devices ? @entity93 says the custom web browser has been designed so that any personal data entered -- whether it be login info for @entity177 or your online bank account -- is completely wiped clean with every press of the home button			2
" we 've designed this to take into account that you 're still inside an airport , " @entity93 said			1
" we want you to feel comfortable			0
we want you to , in a lot of ways , forget that you 're inside an airport			2
but you still have to board a flight , so we 'll remind you about your flight			0
" you can check out the changes now at @entity18 and @entity52			1
@entity53 's @entity11 will debut in early 2013 .			2
