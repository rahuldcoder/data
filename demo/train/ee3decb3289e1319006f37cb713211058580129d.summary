-- when @entity2 and @entity3 first met at a high school just outside of @entity5 , they immediately became firm friends			0
years later , their friendship would serve as the foundation for starting one of @entity11 's first digital advertising companies -- @entity12			1
the firm provides digital screens for corporate clients which can be seen in @entity5 's supermarkets , shops and corporate lobbies			1
it also offers social media services by managing companies ' online presence and growing their fan base			0
" advertising in general was an area of interest " says @entity2			2
" the idea to make it digital was because of the missed opportunity we saw in areas where static adverts were not effective enough to gather interest , for example at waiting areas of an office reception			2
" you can only look at a poster for so long , " he says			0
@entity2 and @entity3 both studied business administration , but were quick to jump on the opportunity they saw in making advertising go digital in @entity11			1
they gathered funds from family and launched their venture			0
" with print , you have to print newspapers every day , but with digital advertising it 's just a matter of changing the content that you have and distributing it online , so the expense of having to go through the printing is minimized , " says @entity2			1
the company now employs seven people and is breaking even , but they hope to start making a profit in the next six months			2
they have already gained patronage from one of the country 's most profitable banks , @entity64 , as well as @entity65 , a large telecom company			1
the young entrepreneurs admit it was n't all plain sailing though -- early challenges included difficulties in coordinating teams which were deployed across @entity11 , and meeting deadlines			1
but @entity2 and @entity3 insist that solving problems helped them learn , and grow a stronger business			0
" what sets us apart from our competitors in the market is that we also create content for them			0
so we 've gone a step further " says @entity3			0
when it comes opportunities for entrepreneurs in @entity11 , both think are great : " many markets out there are saturated , " says @entity2 , " however when you come to @entity11 you 'll find that many businesses that exist in other areas do n't exist in @entity11 , so that 's an opportunity that exists			1
" the team want to expand their business to the country 's classrooms by providing interactive digital solutions for teachers , and they also want to take their screens outdoors : " we envision starting a digital revolution in @entity11 and , who knows , perhaps in other parts of @entity101 as well			1
it would be a dream come true			0
