-- with its luminous body seemingly hovering above the water , and five spidery legs plunging deep into the sea , this futuristic building could be the mothership in a sci - fi film			2
in fact , it 's the design for one of the world 's largest underwater hotels -- and it could be coming to a beach near you			1
introducing the @entity15 , a luxury multi-million dollar resort featuring 21 moveable rooms found in the heart of spectacular coral reefs			1
@entity20 to @entity21 the space - age hotel is now set to be built on the remote -- and postcard perfect -- tropical island of @entity26 in the @entity20 , with the @entity27 giving the go - ahead to the ambitious plan last week			1
the @entity30 may soon be the next home of the high - tech hotel , with a @entity21 construction company also in negotiations to build the surreal structure			1
" there are many people who will never have the courage to dive to these beautiful reefs , " designer , @entity36 , told @entity0			0
" but here you will have the chance to explore an underwater world from the comfort of your bedroom			1
" space - age seascape described as " @entity54 meets the undersea world of @entity56 , " the remarkable building -- valued at up to $ 50 million -- is the brainchild of @entity51 company @entity50 , backed by @entity53 investors			1
the luminous hotel features two large disc - shaped lounges seven - meters above the water , housing a luxury restaurant and spa			2
the lounges are connected to a glass tunnel plunging 30 - meters below the water , leading to 21 opulent bedrooms			0
" a lot of people have said it looks like something from a @entity72 film , " said @entity36			2
" i 'm a big fan of the movies , so perhaps that was an inspiration			0
" " i wanted to keep it as sleek and simple as possible -- so the sphere shape is very efficient			0
" deep end the cutting - edge hotel may plunge deep beneath the ocean , but its luxury facilities are sky - high , including a helicopter landing pad and rooftop swimming pool			2
guests can sit back and enjoy views of vibrant reefs and tropical fish , all from the comfort of their bed			2
those wanting to explore the spectacular underwater world , can also dive straight in from the hotel 's airlock compartment , including its own decompression chamber			1
the more adventurous can even take a ride in a three - passenger deep - sea submarine			0
moving on up not only does the hotel look like a spaceship -- it actually moves like one , with the largest underwater saucer - shaped room able to slide to the surface in emergencies			2
" if you need to replace a window for example , it 's very difficult underwater , " explained @entity36			0
" so we wanted to build a building that can surface any time for maintenance or safety			0
" " it 's a bit like a balloon underwater -- when we let go of the water from the room 's huge tanks , the balloon will surface automatically			0
it does n't need to rely on electricity			0
" environmental concerns developers hope to limit the impact on coral reefs by laying the foundation in as few points as possible			1
there are also plans to rebuild coral reefs , by growing the vibrant eco-systems in a special plantation before relocating them around the hotel			1
" to preserve the natural environment we have developed couple of kinds of foundations depending on the local conditions , " said @entity36			0
" the key is to touch the sea ground in just few points			0
" " most probably the hotel will land on a flat sand area to reflect the sun rays inside the rooms and the reef will be additionally planted around the hotel rooms to enrich the view			0
" the space - age design might seem like something from the future			1
but it seems this unique underwater hotel will be much closer than you think .			1

imagine *waking* from your hotel bed to a dramatic underwater world
soon the dream will be reality , with an underwater hotel to be built in the @entity20
the space - age structure looks like something from @entity72 , features three ' saucers '
developers hope to limit the impact on coral reefs with *sustainable* design
