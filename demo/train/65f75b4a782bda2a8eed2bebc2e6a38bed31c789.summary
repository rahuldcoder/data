@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 used to visit the suburban @entity4 in the summer to escape the scorching temperature in the city			1
now she comes here to turn up the heat on a subject close to her heart			0
animal rights advocate @entity3 mixes leftovers to feed stray cats			1
" this is our experiment to save the city 's stray cats , " said the 62 - year - old retired tv journalist , as she carried two plastic containers full of leftovers out of her villa surrounded by lush greenery			1
calling out a dozen snoozing cats by the bushes , @entity3 watched them rush over and devour the rice mixed with pork and fish			2
@entity3 , who heads the @entity32 , estimates there are some 200,000 stray cats in @entity0 , after her group spent more than two years studying the population			1
she detailed the precarious state of the felines in an 80,000 - word report and decided to start her rescue mission with the 72 cats roaming the sanatorium 's sprawling ground			2
" the health bureau runs this place and agreed to let us take care of the cats , " @entity3 said , lifting up a female kitten to check the healing of the surgery wound on its stomach			1
" we have already neutered and vaccinated a third of them			0
" " we convinced the health officials that stray cats could be a more effective and environmentally friendly way of rodent control than placing 15 tons of rat poisons across the city every year , " she explained			1
this is the kind of win - win solution that @entity3 hopes to replicate throughout the capital , where stray animals are frequently culled by the government on fears of spreading diseases or attacking humans			1
for @entity3 and other members of her @entity74 , saving stray cats is just one uphill battle in their war against animal cruelty in a culture that often treats man 's four - legged friends with little favor			1
for over 15 years and with meager funding , they have been setting up shelters to house abandoned pets , persuading restaurants to take dog meat off the menus and , most importantly , lobbying legislators to pass an animal welfare law -- a goal that nevertheless remains distant			1
" many in the government and society still consider us peripheral and alternative -- and do n't recognize and approve our work , " @entity3 said			2
when @entity0 won the bid to host the @entity100 seven years ago , she and fellow activists perceived a perfect catalyst in expanding animal rights			2
to their dismay , the authorities have since stepped up their campaigns against animals -- pets and strays alike -- aimed at " cleaning up " the city for the @entity109			0
in 2006 @entity0 implemented a controversial " one family , one dog " rule for urban households and required such pet dogs no taller than 35 centimeters ( 14 inches )			2
" it is such a ridiculous law , " @entity3 raised her voice , still livid			0
" anyone with a little understanding of animals would know that the temperament of dogs has nothing to do with their size , but depends on their breed and training			0
" although official policies are difficult to modify , @entity3 feels her efforts have slowly changed the minds of many ordinary citizens			0
" people 's attitude toward animals reflects their attitude toward fellow human beings , " she offered			0
" we should promote love , not hatred , from an early age on			0
" @entity3 has seen more young people grow receptive to the concept of animal welfare and now also counts some unlikely volunteers -- including a former policewoman -- among her 600 - strong group			1
with the @entity149 around the corner , however , @entity3 has become jittery amid reports of an intensifying government crackdown on animals			1
" i feel my heart is in my throat , " she admitted			0
" many officials get money and quotas for culling -- they simply find it so much easier than caring for animals			0
" as she finished feeding the cats at the sanatorium , @entity3 received a phone call from an animal lover living in a residential compound near the @entity149 district			1
" they are crying for help for the 30 stray cats there , " she said			2
" they have neutered and vaccinated 90 percent of those cats , but officials still sealed the cats in the basement with cement because of health and safety concerns during the @entity109			0
" frantically dialing , @entity3 tried to reach the right person before time ran out for the felines			0
" innocent animals should n't have to pay the ultimate price for the @entity149 , " she said			2
@entity185 is a @entity0 - based freelance writer and former @entity2 producer .			0
