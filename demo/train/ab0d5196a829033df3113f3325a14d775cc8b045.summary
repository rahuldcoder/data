@entity0 -- two @entity3 soldiers were convicted of ordering a 9 - year - old boy to open bags they thought might be booby - trapped during @entity3 's incursion into @entity8 nearly two years ago			1
the three - judge military panel said the soldiers knew that endangering civilians is strictly forbidden by military law , according to legal papers obtained by @entity1			1
they have not been named or sentenced yet			0
@entity3 military and criminal investigators have conducted dozens of probes into actions of @entity3 troops during the incursion , known as @entity20 , which was intended to halt the firing of missiles from @entity8 into @entity3			1
more than 1,400 @entity23 died in @entity3 's incursion , according to officials in @entity8			1
the @entity3 military said 1,166 people were killed , 60 percent of whom were " terror operatives			2
" a 575 - page report approved by the @entity30 in 2009 -- accused both @entity3 and @entity31 of " actions amounting to war crimes , possibly crimes against humanity " during the three - week offensive that ended in january 2009			1
earlier this year , the @entity3 military disciplined two officers -- a brigadier general and a colonel -- for allowing artillery shells to be fired into a populated area of @entity8			1
there was at least one earlier criminal conviction , of a soldier found guilty of stealing a credit card			0
another @entity3 soldier faces a manslaughter charge in the death of a @entity23 waving a white flag during a three - week incursion , the @entity3 military said in july			1
the manslaughter charge was filed after an investigation into the shooting , the @entity50 said in a news release			0
" this decision is based on evidence that the soldier , who was serving as a designated marksman , deliberately targeted an individual walking with a group of people waving a white flag without being ordered or authorized to do so , " the @entity50 said			2
in another incident , a battalion commander authorized sending a @entity23 man into a house sheltering terrorists next to his own house in order to persuade them to leave , the news release said			0
the commander was indicted " because he deviated from authorized and appropriate @entity50 behavior " and ignored rules on the use of civilians in military operations , it said			0
the @entity50 statement in july also said a criminal investigation has been ordered into an incident in which a residence holding about 100 members of a family was struck from the air			2
in a separate case , an investigation into an assertion that the @entity88 mosque had been attacked concluded that that did not happen , but that an aerial strike near the mosque had occurred			0
" the aerial strike targeted a terror operative involved in the launching of rockets toward @entity3 who was standing outside of the mosque , " the news release said			2
" injuries caused to civilians inside were unintentional and caused by shrapnel that penetrated the mosque			0
" but the investigation concluded that the officer who ordered the attack had " failed to exercise appropriate judgment " and , as a result , will not be allowed to serve in similar positions of command			0
legal measures were deemed unnecessary , however			0
" the military advocate general decided that the attack did not violate international laws of warfare because the attack did not target the mosque , rather it targeted a terror operative , and when the attack was authorized , no possibility of harming civilians was identified , " it said			0
@entity3 investigators looked into more than 150 reports and conducted nearly 50 probes of incidents during @entity20			1
but @entity23 said @entity3 's actions were unsatisfactory			1
" i think @entity3 should take all responsibility for all the war crimes that it is responsible for during its unjustified war in @entity8 , and what they just announced is too little too late , " @entity23 spokesman @entity125 told @entity1 in july			1
@entity1 's @entity133 in @entity0 contributed to this report .			2
