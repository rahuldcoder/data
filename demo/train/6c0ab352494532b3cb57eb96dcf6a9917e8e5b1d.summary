the tip advised there was information about the heist on @entity8			1
@entity12 's attorney said friday the @entity8 postings may show his client was immature and deserving of a short prison term or probation			1
according to the @entity16 's affidavit , @entity12 told authorities the amateurish scheme was hatched by another teller , @entity44			0
@entity45 was a teller during a previous unsolved bank robbery " and believed staging the robbery would be easy , " according to the affidavit			1
" @entity12 advised the plan was for herself and @entity45 to pick a date where they would both be working the late shift and they would plan for the staged robbery to take place close to closing time , thus minimizing the chances of any customers being in the bank , " according to the affidavit			1
@entity18 and @entity62 , @entity45 's brother , were recruited , authorities said			0

@entity12 allegedly wrote , " i 'm rich " on @entity18 's page on march 25			2
@entity87 , an attorney for @entity18 , told @entity0 that his client was not referring to the bank robbery in his @entity8 posts			1
" i do n't feel the @entity8 thing is as relevant as everyone is making it to be , " @entity91 said			1
" i think it was just young kids talking , " said @entity91 , adding @entity18 , who could face 10 years in prison , has been " upfront " with investigators			0
" he knew he was in over his head			0
" @entity91 said the incident was more akin to an employee theft			0
@entity104 was not a mastermind and his role " should be mitigated " in any prosecution , the lawyer said			0
@entity108 , who represents @entity12 , said the single mother has never been in trouble and likely will enter a plea , arguing her age and maturity should be factors in sentencing			0
