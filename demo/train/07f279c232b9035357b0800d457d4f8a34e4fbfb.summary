-- do i stay or do i go ? almost everyone has already boarded the plane , including dozens of journalists			1
the airport staff , including lots of security guards , are now glaring at me			2
this is the flight many people believe will carry @entity10 from @entity11 to @entity12			1
but there 's no sign of @entity10			1
my cameraman is already on the plane			2
he 's supposed to message me if there 's a confirmed sighting			1
if i get on and @entity10 does n't we 're committing to a @entity12 round trip that will take us a long way from the story			1
there are too many scenarios and no safe bets			2
if i do n't see him and do n't board , he could still join the aircraft on the tarmac later			2
another journalist is already tweeting excitedly about a @entity33 van parked next to the plane			0
i 'm constantly on the phone with @entity36			0
the bosses make a decision			0
there 's only one way to know for sure			1
read more : @entity10 ' free man ' for a story with so few confirmed facts , sending us on a flight to @entity12 , despite the uncertain outcome , was considered a valuable insurance policy			1
when i step on board i see a frenzy of men with video cameras and flight attendants trying to stop them			2
but there 's no @entity10			1
so we wait , nervously glancing between the door and the tarmac			0
there is an unusually high number of men in police - like uniforms surrounding the plane			2
a hungry media pack is desperately looking for any sign of the man as the clock ticks down to our departure time			0
but hope is not dead			0
he could still be whisked out to meet the plane			0
that 's not what happens			2
minutes later the @entity78 jet is in the air bound for @entity80			0
the story remains on the ground somewhere in @entity11			1
after takeoff , we do a row - by - row search			1
we look in the galleys , the washrooms			0
i stick my head in the curtained - off rest area for the flight crew			1
a grey haired @entity93 man stares back with confusion in the dark space			0
it all confirms what we were already pretty sure of			0
read more : no - show leaves reporters stuck on plane there 's only one area we ca n't check - the cockpit			1
it seems unlikely @entity93 authorities or @entity109 would allow @entity10 to travel in the secure pointy end of the aircraft			1
but the circumstances of this story fit the general rule i 've developed through living in @entity93			0
anything , no matter how logic defying , is possible			0
i keep a close eye on the crew coming and going from the cockpit just in case			0
frustrated journalists huddle around seat 17a			1
some earlier reports said this was where @entity10 would be sitting			1
a good part of the flight is spent debating theories on @entity10 's plans for escape and his chances of success			1
what role @entity93 and @entity139 ? it 's all just speculation with a little logic thrown in			2
in other words , like so many people around the world right now , we 're all just guessing			0
but at least we knew he was n't on the aircraft			0
back on earth , my colleagues at @entity0 had no way of being so certain			1
moments before takeoff , i 'd communicated by phone there was no sign of @entity10			1
but that did n't mean he was n't on board somewhere			0
and as we crossed the globe i had no way of passing on the results of our detailed search			2
neither @entity109 nor the @entity93 government had confirmed or denied if he was on the flight			2
so my news organization was still tracking its path across @entity93 , @entity168 , the @entity169 , @entity170 and the eastern states of @entity172			0
we even flew very close to @entity0 's world headquarters in @entity174			1
read more : how hunt humiliated @entity172 it was not until the aircraft doors opened at our destination and i first felt the sticky , warm @entity12 air that i was able to call in again and confirm definitively @entity10 had not left @entity93 on that flight			1
a much dreamed of travel destination for this @entity184 journalist			0
those dreams would remain unfulfilled			0
i 'd arrived with no accreditation or visa			0
i could n't legally enter the country			0
my @entity80 adventure involved one hour in the transit lounge desperately negotiating with officials to allow me back on the same aircraft for the return flight to @entity11			1
but during my brief time in the soulless transit area there were still many incredibly warm @entity80 smiles			0
the return flight was even less eventful			2
@entity202 was spent writing this account and editing the video story of our travels			0
in total we endured around 30 hours of pretty darn comfortable business class travel for little journalistic result			0
it 's not the stuff that inspires enormous work satisfaction in my trade			2
but after arriving back in @entity11 and while sitting in this city 's horrific traffic , one senior @entity0 editor thanked me for making the journey			1
he said the time consuming , sleep depriving , costly act necessary to confirm @entity10 was n't on that flight was highly valuable in our coverage of a story where basic questions remain unanswered			1
what will @entity10 do next ?			1

@entity228 leaker @entity10 was believed to be flying from @entity11 to @entity12
dozens of journalists boarded the flight he was believed to be traveling on
