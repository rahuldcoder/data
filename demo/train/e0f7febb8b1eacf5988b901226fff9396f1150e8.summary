-- raised steins , raised bosoms , leather - clad @entity4 thighs			2
@entity5 's sure got a beer tent full of clichés about it			1
but bet you do n't know why " @entity10 " is untranslatable ( let alone unpronounceable ) , what false teeth were doing in the lost property bin last year and whether the yodeling or oompah tent would best suit your personality			1
@entity4 's biggest beer love - in kicks off in @entity19 on saturday , september 21 , and runs through october 6			2
gird your bosom , hitch those hosen worried that squeezing into a bosom - lifting dirndl or a pair of skin - tight lederhosen will make you look ridiculous ? do n't worry : it will , but considering almost everyone will also resemble an extra in a b - grade medieval romp , you 'll fit right in			1
to put it another way , when in @entity4 , do as the @entity31 do -- and they 're pretty proud of their huntsman - and - strapping - maid heritage			2
rent a costume if you do n't fancy splashing out on your own outfit			1
although -- used lederhosen ? 2			1
learn to belt out " @entity5 der @entity10 " fitting in at @entity5 is all about getting the balance right			2
leather shorts and flouncy dresses : good			2
beer stein hats : bad			2
not anything , though ( unless it 's really late )			0
@entity4 bonding is about sing - alongs , and one such tune you 'll hear time and again at the festival is " @entity5 der @entity10			1
" it 's tricky to translate because " @entity10 " is supposed to mean some fusion of " happiness " and " belonging " that @entity53 are too uptight to understand			0
so try mumbling , " cheers to something - @entity53 - are - too - uptight - to - understand " and then the important bit -- clink glasses			0
find table ; do n't visit rest room you 're thinking : oh , @entity31 sound really jolly			1
not at all the punctuality freaks of @entity62 stereotype			1
well , kind of , but this country did n't set the standard for luxury precision automobiles without thinking ahead			1
which means that @entity67 book tables months in advance in the most popular @entity5 tents ( see below for a tent - by - personality guide )			1
without a reservation you 'll spend hours queuing and , even if you eventually get a seat , will lose it as soon as you pop to the toilet			0
sit on that @entity78 helmet of the thousands of items ending up in lost property each year at @entity83 past , some have been obvious : @entity78 helmets , ( ahem ) wedding rings , @entity87 horns			0
others were less obvious : false teeth , ( live ) grasshoppers			0
lesson : do n't bring anything precious to @entity5 , especially not your dignity			1
drink like a @entity95 you know those patronizing stories about how @entity101 -- unlike @entity98 , brits and @entity100 -- do n't get drunk but sit around sipping @entity102 in sidewalk cafes , quoting @entity104 ? they 're not all lies ! that said , @entity67 do have a word for a paralytic person -- a @entity109 , meaning beer corpse			1
surviving 12 hours of solid drinking is a marathon , not a sprint , so make each liter @entity115 ( those jug - like glasses ) last			0
at up to 8 % , this wheat beer is strong stuff			0
for the record , a @entity115 costs around € 9.80 ( $ 13 ) in 2013			0
tip well if you expect to be served again			0
choose your tent there are 14 tents in all at @entity5 and the one you choose says a lot about you			1
" tent , " though , requires some clarification -- this is n't boy scout - related			1
@entity130 and @entity131 tents each have a mammoth 10,000 seats ( around six million people will attend the festival in total ) , filled with a generally youngish , oompah - singing , rollicking international crowd			0
@entity137 - drinking celebrities hang out in the @entity138 or @entity142 's @entity141 - @entity140 tent			2
arguably the best beer is served in the traditional , family - friendly @entity145 ( where people are likely still to be noticing such things ) , though the roaring lion at the @entity151 would have something to say about that			0
would - be shepherds drink under a painted sky at @entity156 , dubbed the @entity157 der @entity4 ( " @entity158 " ) , while @entity159 has a resident yodeler			0
do your @entity161 luckily , @entity5 food -- make that @entity62 food , in general -- seems designed to protect the stomach , and reputation , against excessive wheat beer consumption			1
a meal of @entity161 in various guises -- pork knuckles with sauerkraut , goulash and dumplings and pretzels as big as your head with @entity177 , a camembert - paprika dip -- is ideal preparation for a more or less civilized session at the stein table			0
@entity182 -- sour calf - lung dumplings -- is another @entity4 speciality , yet one that risks having the opposite effect from that intended			0
the restaurants page on @entity189 has a selection of traditional @entity4 restaurants in @entity19			0
wear your dirndl bow right @entity194 ! banquets ! maidens ! debauchery ... ... er , no. bavarians might let their braces down at @entity5 but while flirting is fine , even expected , it stops at a very firm line			1
you can call a lady fesch ( pretty ) , but do n't imagine you 're in the aforementioned b - grade medieval romp and start praising her @entity204 ( lit. lovely dumplings -- no need to spell it out )			2
ladies , be aware of the signals your dirndl bow is sending out : to the right means attached , to the left , single , in the center -- not recommended and somehow unlikely to be true -- a virgin			1
play the proper tourist believe it or not , there 's more to @entity5 than beer - guzzling , thigh - slapping revelry			0
you can see its more traditional side at saturday 's opening @entity222 , where a thousand tent owners and brewers parade through @entity19 's streets with horse - drawn , flower - bedecked drays laden with barrels			2
it 's also kitsch heaven , with @entity5 - themed steins , fridge magnets and snow globes on sale , plus the chance to get a last - minute embroidered dirndl or lederhosen ( used or unused )			1
visit @entity237 to plan your own @entity5 adventure .			0

do n't worry about looking ridiculous in lederhosen : everyone does
be prepared to sing along in *voluble* if not *terribly* *accurate* @entity62
choose your " personality tent "
@entity247 which way a virgin wears her dirndl bow
