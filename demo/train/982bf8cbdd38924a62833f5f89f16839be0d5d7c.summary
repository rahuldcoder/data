when a suicide bomber detonated his truck outside @entity4 in @entity5 in 2009 , it was n't the first time that type of attack killing @entity10 soldiers took place			1
but the bombing took a different and disturbing turn when investigators determined it was facilitated not by militants on the battlefields of @entity5 but out of one man 's home just north of the @entity10			1
according to the @entity19 , this suicide operation , which killed five @entity10 soldiers and several @entity5 citizens , was orchestrated from @entity23 , @entity24 , by @entity25 , a 36 - year - old accused of being member of a global terrorist recruiting cell that funneled foreign fighters into @entity5			1
though ' @entity25 was arrested in @entity23 in 2011 , where he has been detained ever since , he was extradited to the @entity10 on friday			1
and on saturday , in a federal court in @entity32 , @entity33 , he entered a plea of not guilty to his alleged role in the gruesome attack			0
on april 10 , 2009 , a five - vehicle convoy of @entity10 soldiers were exiting @entity38 in @entity39			1
@entity10 military personnel eyewitnesses described a dump truck coming under fire by @entity5 guards at on the road at the perimeter of the base			2
the truck managed to breach the checkpoint , passing four of the vehicles before detonating next to the fifth vehicle			0
the 60 - foot - deep crater left at the blast site was about 50 yards outside of the base 's entrance			0
the explosion killed five @entity10 soldiers : sgt. @entity56 , @entity57 , sgt. fc @entity58 , cpl. @entity60 and staff sgt. @entity61			1
several @entity5 citizens were also killed			1
` @entity25 is charged not only with the murder of these five soldiers , but also with providing material support to terrorists , as well a conspiracy to commit murder of foreign nationals abroad			0
the last charge stems from a multiyear investigation by @entity24 , @entity72 and @entity10 law enforcement using wiretaps , email surveillance and other physical evidence that places ' @entity78 in an integral role in what is referred to as a " facilitation network			0
" law enforcement officials say ' @entity25 's role in the network included instructing prospective suicide bombers on leaving their homes without raising suspicion , figuring out the route they should take to enter @entity5 and putting them in touch with @entity5 - based terrorists			1
in recorded phone and electronic communications with numerous co-conspirators , including would - be suicide bombers and facilitators based in @entity5 , ' @entity25 often referred to carrying out terrorist attacks as getting " married , " as in marriage to 70 virgins or " farming , " because they " plant metal and harvest metal and flesh , " according to the @entity19 's criminal complaint			2
' @entity25 is accused helping at least eight @entity72 foreign fighters cross into @entity104 , eventually making their way to @entity39 , @entity5 , via @entity106 to meet with his network of @entity5 - based facilitator contacts			2
the investigation , according to @entity110 officials , revealed that at least three of these foreign fighters carried out at least two suicide attacks			0
one of them was the @entity117 attack			0
at least three other individuals listed as " facilitators " were arrested in @entity5 by @entity121 officials and subsequently debriefed by the @entity122 , but it is unclear whether they have or will face similar charges			0
court documents show ' @entity25 regularly checking in with the foreign fighters to find out the status of their " marriages " -- and he even discussed his terrorist activities with his own family based in @entity5			2
they purport that he told his mother how effective that a sniper rife , or " bride with a crown , " would be in @entity134 against coalition forces			0
and that he urged his sister to " learn about weapons and go attack the police and @entity10			0
" in a news release announcing ' @entity25 's extradition from @entity24 , assistant attorney general @entity141 said , " the families of these five @entity10 and all who have lost loved ones to act of terrorism should know that we will never cease seeking to hold terrorists accountable for their acts			1
