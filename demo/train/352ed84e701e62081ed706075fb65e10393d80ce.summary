-- as a teenager , @entity1 was shot in the face with an unsecured firearm			1
he still struggles with the trauma			2
but the @entity7 engineer now believes he has created a device that would have saved him and may save thousands of others			0
he calls it " @entity15 , " and while it still needs final adjustments to the prototype and further investment , @entity1 expects to launch his smart gun technology in @entity18 stores within a year , retailing for around $ 300			1
the device attaches to the trigger of a handgun , which can then only be unlocked by biometric authentication , preventing any unauthorized user from firing the weapon			0
drawing on breakthroughs in mobile technology , the trigger is released by similar fingerprint sensors to those used in @entity31 's @entity30			1
those sensors are approved by the @entity33 , and widely found in security scanners			1
" the key is reliability , " says @entity1			1
" the sensor has proved itself in different sectors over the past few years and the market is aware of its capability			0
" the gun is enabled in under a second from first contact , and engineers are chipping away to further reduce the time			1
eventually , it is hoped the lock will be integrated and the release will be instant			0
" the main point of firearms ownership is home defense , and home defense means quick access , " says @entity1			1
" but the other side of that is accidents			0
" the inventor believes his experience indicates an urgent and avoidable crisis and the statistics support him			0
according to the @entity62 , in 2010 , 62 children aged one to 14 were killed in firearm accidents in the @entity18 , and 785 from 1999 to 2010 -- far higher death tolls than school shootings over the same period			0
@entity1 is not interested in politics and keeps his vision simple			1
" i 'm a gun victim , a gun owner , and i have children			1
i came up with something that fits my needs			0
" i was working as a safety engineer for airbag calibration , and it did n't make sense that there was something so simple that had such an impact on safety , but not for guns			1
in essence , this is a product of that question			0
" surge of innovation even if all goes to plan , @entity1 's will not be the first smart gun system to hit the @entity18 market			1
in february , @entity89 firm @entity88 launched its @entity91 pistol that uses a radio frequency identification ( @entity94 ) chip activated by the owner 's watch , and the competition is growing			1
directives from the @entity99 to promote development of safety technology in the wake of school shootings have led to a surge of innovation			2
there is now an increased appetite and funding for a field that had stalled since the earlier designs in the 1970s			0
the boldest statement is an open challenge from @entity113			0
it was created by @entity116 angel investor @entity115 and serial entrepreneur @entity117 in response to the @entity120 shootings and is making $ 1 million in prizes available for development of the best ideas			1
the foundation claims to have received over 200 entrants after the first month of the submission period , everything from concept stage to working prototype			0
designs include electronic ammunition , remote controls and @entity94 chips buried in the owner 's skin			1
researchers at the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) have been developing biometric designs since 1999			2
the leader of that program , @entity141 , has seen many false dawns but is more confident than ever			0
" the difference now to a decade ago is that there are more types of technology and they are all much better			2
biometric technology failed one time out of four then , now we aim for one in 10,000 failure rates " , says @entity141			2
" the reliability of the safety needs to exceed that of the underlying firing mechanism , so there is never a discussion that the gun would n't work because of the technology			1
" ' production ready ' @entity141 's view is borne out by 2013 research into gun safety technology from the @entity160 ( @entity160 )			1
the report tested reliability in a range of @entity94 and biometric designs against existing firearms , and gave several ratings of " @entity167 or @entity168			0
" " it is only recently that viable product designs have reached a commercializable or production - ready level of maturity , " the report stated			0
@entity137 remains at the vanguard , working with " @entity175 , " perhaps the most ambitious system in development			0
the design uses a battery of sensors to build a " movie " of the user , learning the size and weight of their grip , and even their tics and manner with the gun to be sure of authorizing the correct user			1
as sensor technology continues to improve , the scope for progress is exponential , says @entity141			2
a new prototype will be unveiled in june , promising to improve speed and accuracy , using an enhanced microprocessor that draws less power and needs less space			0
this design is the result of collaboration with military partners @entity205 in @entity206			0
beyond their technical expertise , @entity141 recognizes what military involvement could do for public acceptance ahead of a commercial launch and manufacturing			0
" the technology we have developed is primarily for the civilian population , but to gain traction in those communities it needs to be used and endorsed by icons of gun ownership such as police and military , " says @entity141			1
with the phenomenon of " @entity224 " attacks in @entity226 ( supposed allies carried out dozens of attacks on @entity230 forces in 2012 ) there is mutual interest , says security technologist @entity233 : " re-use of soldier 's weapons is a hot issue and the army are concerned			2
but taking responsibility if ( smart technology ) goes wrong is a massive step			1
i could imagine use in non-critical settings in the near - term future -- the next three to five years -- and then a long period to see if people are comfortable with it			0
" opposition the size of the civilian market is unclear			0
@entity137 research found that 72 % of @entity206 gun owners supported the development of smart technology , and that parents could be a fruitful market			1
but a recent poll from the @entity257 found that just 14 % of @entity18 are likely to buy a smart gun , and the majority believe they are unreliable			1
many gun rights advocates are hostile to the concept , arguing it is a ploy for gun control and is against the @entity265			2
some gun advocates also argue that the electronics could be hacked by criminals			2
opposition to @entity271 's launch has reportedly been strong enough that it forced the vendor to withdraw its products			2
the @entity275 store which announced it would be selling @entity88 products swiftly distanced itself from them following a severe backlash from gun rights activists			2
the major gun manufacturers have also been wary			2
@entity141 works with major gun manufacturers and believes their reluctance stems partly from fears that once the first smart guns are established , the technology will become mandatory			1
he sympathizes : " it would be better if the transformation came through market demand rather than regulatory pressure			0
" such fears may be justified			0
in 2002 , @entity206 became the first @entity18 state to legislate that new guns must be personalized within three years of the technology becoming available			1
the idea is also gaining currency across @entity297			0
should such mandates be enacted , or if the new designs find a strong market , the drip - drip of smart gun innovation may well become a flood			1
gallery : what the @entity305 really looks like web inventor : we need internet freedom			0

@entity1 shot as teenager , now developing smart gun technology
smart guns can only be fired by authorized users
@entity317 *offering* $ 1 million in prizes for smart gun ideas
some guns use fingerprint sensors , others use chip in owner 's watch
