-- anyone who has struggled to be healthy is intimately familiar with the counting game			0
they 've counted calories , carbs , @entity7 points , their heart rate , steps and miles			0
now a new smart eating utensil called the @entity11 will help them count bites during meals , and maybe shame them into eating slower and potentially losing weight			1
technology has made it easier to track the minutiae of everyday life , with smartphones , pedometers and small sensors that can fit in wearable devices such as wrist bands			2
the self - tracking hobby has blossomed into the quantified - self movement , which reaches far beyond the health conscious			0
people are tracking their sleep patterns , heart rate , mood , air quality and work habits , often in a bid to analyze enough data to correct problems with their health or lifestyle			0
" whatever we can measure , we can improve , " said @entity40 , ceo and founder of @entity42			0
in the case of the @entity11 , what can be improved is how fast people eat			1
it takes 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it is full and that it 's time to stop eating , putting speedy eaters at risk for being overeaters			0
the @entity11 team says there are many potential health benefits to eating slower , including decreasing acid reflux , obesity and diabetes			1
the $ 99 fork first gained attention during the @entity63 in january and will be on the market by the end of the year			1
how it works the fork can be used to passively track eating habits and automatically sync that information , including duration of meals and frequency of forkfuls , with a smartphone			2
the @entity11 mobile app will also include a coaching program and tools to connect with friends and family			1
the device can also be set up for behavior modification , vibrating any time the diner is eating too quickly as a gentle reminder to slow down			1
by default it is set to allow a bite every 10 seconds , though the exact time is customizable			1
when the metal tines of the @entity11 touch the mouth , a circuit is closed and a bite is tallied			1
the data is automatically transmitted to a smartphone over @entity93 or can be uploaded using a micro usb port in the base			0
the fork , which can stay charged for 15 days , has a thick plastic handle that houses the electronics			2
the core pops out so the fork can be washed by hand or run through a dishwasher			2
you must hold down a button to turn it on before each meal , but it powers down automatically after you stop using it			0
a hands - on ( and mouth - on ) test i tested the fork out this week on a lunch of seared - tuna salad			2
there are only 10 prototypes of the @entity11 , each thoroughly sanitized between the many test eaters ( i hope )			1
it was a pretty tasty salad , and soon slow , responsible bites turned into shoveling			2
when two bites happened in the same 10 second window , the fork vibrated -- a somewhat unsettling feeling especially if it 's near your teeth			1
i 'd slow down for a while , mostly out of embarrassment , but eventually i 'd forget and the fork would buzz me again			2
it happened about five times during the length of the meal -- a fairly typical count for newbies , according to @entity40			0
@entity42 subscribes to the theory that it takes 21 days to create a habit			0
if you use the fork consistently for 21 days , it should retrain you to automatically eat slower at all times			1
one meal was n't enough time to cure me of my snarfing ways , but i was more aware of how fast i ate for the rest of the day			0
origin of the smart fork the fork was invented seven years ago by @entity147 , who compares the retraining to techniques used by habitual nail biters to cut down on their nibbling			1
such as coating nails with bitter - tasting polish , for example			0
last year @entity147 connected with 5 - year - old health and fitness content company @entity42 , which is based in @entity157 and @entity158			2
the two joined forces just in time to take the first prototypes to @entity63 in @entity163 , where it was an instant hit			0
@entity42 has 120 employees , only 10 to 15 of whom are currently working on the @entity11 project			1
but that ratio could change soon if the fork takes off			2
when can you get one ? on wednesday , the @entity11 team launched a 45 - day @entity172 campaign to raise $ 100,000 and sign up the first 1,000 users			1
those early adopters will be the company 's first chance to collect a large amount of data and test how effective the fork 's vibration is at changing eaters ' behavior			1
@entity42 plans to start shipping the first forks to early @entity172 donors at the end of the summer , and roll the devices out to everyone by the end of the year			1
" we want to cater to a community of people who like to eat mindfully , " said @entity40			2
@entity192 , data everywhere since it has started collecting data from test users , @entity42 has found that people take about 70 fork bites per meal			1
they start eating fast but slow down after six minutes , and in an interesting bit of carb trivia , they tend to eat rice much faster than pasta ( possibly due to the labor - intensive twirling process )			0
this is just a sliver of the kind of insight the fork could give the company and medical researchers into how people eat			1
that potential is what makes the fork more than just a silly and fun novelty gadget			0
it represents an evolution in tracking technology			0
in the coming years sensors will pop up in more and more household objects tracking things like air quality , movement , vital signs and other stats			1
this potential flood of sensors could lead to a mess of data , with each piece of information tracked in its own app. fitness trackers like the @entity227 and the @entity228 are already hugely popular			0
a new company , @entity230 startup @entity229 , recently announced it is working on tracking devices that fit onto water bottles and monitor how much water you drink			0
ideally all the sensor companies will work together so that different data can be shared across apps and devices , allowing it to be analyzed for even more insightful conclusions			0
( do you eat less on days you get more than 8 hours sleep ? does the air quality in your home effect your mood ? )			0

the @entity11 tracks how quickly you eat , vibrating if your bites are less than 10 seconds apart
the company behind the smart fork has launched a @entity172 campaign to raise $ 100,000
@entity252 is one of many household objects that will likely get sensors in coming years
