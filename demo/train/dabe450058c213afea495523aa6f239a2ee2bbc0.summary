no , you 're not			0
that 's where the crisis in @entity4 stood thursday after lawmakers in @entity7 voted in favor of leaving the country for @entity10 and putting it to a regional vote in 10 days			1
this act drew widespread condemnation , with @entity4 interim prime minister @entity14 calling such a referendum " an illegitimate decision			1
" " @entity7 was , is and will be an integral part of @entity4 , " he said			1
it was a sentiment echoed by several world leaders , who called the scheduled vote and possible pullout violations of @entity4 and international law			2
" any discussion about the future of @entity4 must include the legitimate government of @entity4 , " said @entity24 president @entity23			1
" in 2014 , we are well beyond the days when borders can be redrawn over the heads of democratic leaders			0
" it 's not clear how easily the region could split off from @entity4 even if the referendum endorses the move			1
the developments came at a dizzying pace thursday as @entity14 joined emergency talks in @entity39 , @entity40 , called by leaders of the @entity42 who support the @entity44 government and want to de-escalate the crisis			0
the @entity42 and the @entity24 announced plans to freeze the assets of @entity48 , who was ousted as @entity4 's president after he turned his back on a trade deal with the @entity42 in favor of one with @entity10			1
the rejected trade deal prompted months of protests that culminated in february with bloody street clashes that left dozens dead and @entity48 out of office			0
@entity57 said it is reviewing a request by @entity4 authorities that would allow for the arrest of @entity48 on charges of abuse of power and murder , an allegation tied to the death of protesters			2
@entity67 has denounced the events that led to @entity48 's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new @entity4 authorities , putting the two countries on a collision course over control of the @entity7 , a peninsula on the @entity76 that has long ties to @entity10 and has thousands of @entity10 troops stationed there			1
@entity10 president @entity79 has insisted he has the right to use military force in @entity4 if necessary to protect ethnic @entity10 under threat in @entity7			1
@entity4 officials say no such threat exists and say @entity79 is using it as a pretext to control the region			1
as the standoff continued , @entity4 authorities announced the arrest thursday of a leader of a @entity92 movement in the eastern city of @entity94			2
authorities said he is a @entity4 national named @entity97 , a self - proclaimed governor of @entity94			0
in @entity7 , worlds collide growing divide the crisis threatens to not only divide @entity4 , but @entity10 and the @entity101			1
those two sides have exchanged barbs and threatened punitive measures against each other in recent days , all while offering divergent views on the situation in @entity7			2
two diplomats at the center of the crisis -- @entity24 secretary of state @entity111 and @entity10 foreign minister @entity112 -- met face - to - face on thursday			1
they agreed to continue talking " over the course of the next hours , the next days '' to try to find a political solution to end the crisis , @entity111 told reporters following the meeting			0
the diplomats ' bosses , @entity23 and @entity79 , talked for an hour thursday afternoon , with the @entity24 president stating " @entity10 's actions are in violation of @entity4 's sovereignty " and that there is a diplomatic way out , according to the @entity125			1
@entity79 's office said the call -- initiated by @entity23 -- " revealed differences in approaches and assessments of the causes of the crisis and the current situation			1
" he also voiced @entity10 's view it " can not ignore calls for help " from eastern and southeastern @entity4 , before concluding that @entity112 and @entity111 " will continue intensive contacts			1
" such conversations have n't stopped either side from taking action			0
@entity42 nations , for instance , announced thursday they will suspend bilateral talks with @entity10 on visa matters and have threatened travel bans , asset freezes and cancellation of the @entity42 - @entity10 summit			0
" any further steps by the @entity10 to destabilize the situation in @entity4 would lead to additional and far reaching consequences for relations in a broad range of economic areas , " @entity42 leaders said , having also threatened travels bans on certain @entity10 and the freezing of some assets			2
the @entity24 has taken action			0
the @entity163 has imposed a visa ban on @entity10 and @entity4 officials and others that it says are responsible for , or complicit in , threatening @entity4 's sovereignty and territorial integrity			1
@entity23 signed an executive order laying the groundwork for sanctions against individuals and entities responsible for the crisis			0
despite such pressure , @entity10 has n't budged , even refusing to engage in direct talks with the new @entity4 authorities in @entity44			2
as his office noted after the @entity23 call , @entity79 believes this government " is a result of an unconstitutional revolution " and imposed " illegitimate decisions			1
" the dispute has threatened to boil into a military conflict			0
@entity79 has denied claims by @entity4 officials and @entity101 diplomats that @entity10 has sent thousands of troops into the region in recent days			1
@entity67 says the heavily armed troops , who are in uniforms without insignia and who have reportedly encircled @entity4 bases , are local " self - defense " forces			0
meanwhile , @entity10 has begun an air defense drill 280 miles ( 450 kilometers ) from @entity4 's border , reports @entity10 state - run news agency @entity200			1
a military spokesman called it " the largest - ever exercise held by air defense units " in the region			0
@entity10 authorities said the drills are part of a regular combat training cycle , according to the news agency			0
but the move comes a day after the @entity24 military announced it was beefing up the number of fighter jets in the @entity214 , adding six f - 15s to the four participating in a @entity217 mission in the region			0
five possible ways to end the crisis voting for @entity10 or @entity4 ? amid all the diplomatic wrangling , it is @entity4 who are most directly affected			2
and they hardly are speaking with one voice			0
furor in the western part of the country over @entity48 , his powers and his bringing @entity4 closer to @entity10 led to his ouster			2
now , most people here support the new government and oppose @entity10 intervention , as well as the prospect of @entity7 becoming part of @entity10			2
the sentiment tends to be very different in @entity7 -- which was part of @entity10 until being given to @entity4 in 1954 by @entity236 leader @entity235 -- and other parts of southern and eastern @entity4			1
late last month , the parliament in @entity7 installed a new , @entity240 government late last month -- as armed , @entity92 men besieged the parliament building -- and does not recognize the authorities in @entity44			0
citizens will be allowed to vote on march 16 on whether they want an autonomous republic of @entity7 within @entity10 ; or within @entity4			1
the autonomous region has a 60 % ethnic @entity10 population , having been part of @entity10 until it was ceded to @entity4 in 1954 by the @entity236			2
but not everyone may be as keen on coming under @entity67 's direct influence			0
about 25 % of the peninsula 's population is @entity4 and about 12 % is @entity252 , a predominantly @entity253 group			2
as riot police looked on , hundreds gathered thursday in the southern port city of @entity257 under the flag of the @entity259 calling for unity with @entity10			0
" we are all standing here for @entity10 , " one masked protester told @entity263 's @entity262			2
" none of us wants to be part of the @entity42			0
" late thursday , the management of the hotel in the @entity7 capital of @entity270 where @entity263 has been based told the network to stop broadcasting from there			0
other media outlets got the same message , and no reason was given			0
not everyone in this region wants to become part of @entity10			0
protesters , including one topless woman who was dragged away screaming , railed against the @entity7 parliament vote and @entity79			1
but they were drowned out by a heckling , @entity92 crowd			0
@entity284 , from @entity285 , said that his boss asked him , point - blank , " are you for @entity4 or for @entity10 ? " while his boss favors the latter , @entity284 does not , saying he 'd probably leave if @entity7 ends up splitting from @entity4			1
@entity24 paves way for sanctions on @entity10 , @entity4 over @entity7 @entity291 , a former @entity292 ambassador in @entity293 , said that may not happen -- at least easily or peacefully -- even if voters support such a split in the upcoming referendum			1
" for @entity10 to start cherry - picking bits of the @entity259 , cranking up referenda in @entity300 or @entity301 or wherever you like , to try to carve off bits , would be against international law , " @entity291 said , " and it would be something @entity79 has said he does n't want to do			2
" @entity14 said that if @entity4 is broken up , the world will have trouble ever getting another country to give up its nuclear weapons program			0
why ? in 1994 , @entity4 agreed to give up its @entity236 - era nuclear arsenal in return for guarantees -- signed by the @entity24 , the @entity292 and @entity10 -- of its territorial integrity and independence			1
what happens now to @entity4 " will have an impact on nuclear nonproliferation programs , " @entity14 said			0
