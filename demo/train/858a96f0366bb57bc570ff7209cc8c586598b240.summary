the popular image of wrestling may be of @entity4 superstars pretending to fight each other in luridly - colored spandex but @entity8 's version of the sport has a much more earthy appeal			1
with a battle - worn face that wears the story a thousand bouts and more , the @entity12 freestyle wrestler has risen from the mud wrestling pits of rural @entity12 to produce moments of unscripted theater on crash mats around the world			1
today , @entity8 is warming up inside the @entity22 complex tumbling across a padded floor in preparation for some training bouts overseen by his coach			2
the vast gymnasium in the town of @entity30 , a few miles north of @entity31 has become a center of excellence for @entity12 wrestling in recent times with the 32 - year - old becoming one of the country 's most celebrated mat men			1
it might be easy to attribute his success -- @entity8 is a double @entity43 champion and an @entity45 bronze medalist -- to his impressive , muscle - bound physique , but wrestling is n't just about throwing your weight around , he argues			1
it 's also requires brain power			0
" @entity52 is very different compared to other sports			0
it requires equal use of power as well as equal use of mind , " @entity8 told @entity2 's @entity55 series			2
" it is usually said that wrestlers do not have a sharp mind , but the wrestler ( has to ) use their brain really well ... you have to take a decision to attack or defend within a second			0
" the indoor facility he trains in is a world away from the traditional open - air mud wrestling pit -- called @entity72 -- in his home village of @entity74			1
@entity8 took up the sport when he was eight years old , learning an ancient form of wrestling called @entity78 in the mud before switching to mats during his teenage years			1
during his time in the sport @entity8 says wrestling 's popularity in @entity12 has surged			1
" i have seen the difference of day and night			0
when i was small there was a mud pit wrestling area in my village and not a mat , " he says			2
" there was no infrastructure and facilities when we used to wrestle , but today many have turned professional and now everyone wants to be an @entity45 or @entity97 champion , " he added			0
" the most important thing is wrestling was the game of the village and now it has reached the city			0
and now the people in the city like to play and see wrestling			0
" the sport 's growing profile has been aided by @entity8 's success and that of his contemporary @entity110 , a former world champion and @entity45 silver medalist			1
" i 've known @entity110 from the days i started going to the @entity72 and we used to meet each other in national matches , " he said			0
" we have been friends for the past 18 years			0
we have changed the mind set on wrestling in @entity12 with our friendship -- that is a really big thing			1
" while @entity110 has enjoyed the more successful career to date , @entity8 may now be entering a golden period			2
last year was particularly fruitful as @entity8 clinched a second @entity43 title in @entity121 , @entity122 in august before making history at the @entity124 the following month			1
when @entity8 beat @entity126 's @entity125 in the final of the 65 kg freestyle final in @entity129 he ended an @entity12 wrestling drought , winning the country 's first gold medal at the @entity43 in 28 years			1
it was an emotional moment for @entity8 who dedicated the win to his father who died shortly before the 2006 @entity124 held in @entity137 , @entity138			2
" it was my father 's dream that i wrestle for the country and make the name of the country proud , " @entity8 said			2
@entity8 's recent good run might have come earlier had he not been plagued by injuries			2
his cauliflower ears are testament to a life spent grappling with opponents -- head , neck and back injuries have all sidelined him for extended periods			0
but it was injuries to his knees that have threatened to permanently derail his career			0
tears to both the anterior and medial cruciate ligament of his right knee following the @entity161 required two operations and 10 months out of the sport			0
@entity8 completed a triumphant return to action in 2010 winning the @entity43 title and won a bronze at the @entity168 before another knee injury saw him sit out 2013			1
" there was lot of pressure on me that i have to win a medal in 2012 because you have a dream and if a man comes so close to his dream and then ( fails ) it is very painful			0
i go with a mind set that i have to win and if you win only then will the name of the country be known			0
" achieving a podium at the @entity45 -- @entity12 won just six medals in 2012 -- has earned @entity8 a degree of personal fame in his homeland along with some other perks			1
in 2012 , his local government in @entity190 awarded him cash and land following his @entity45 success and the following year he was recognized on a national level when he was the recipient of a @entity195 , @entity12 's fourth highest civilian award			1
his sights are now firmly set on preparing for one final push for @entity45 gold in @entity199 next year			2
" now that i have won gold at the @entity124 , i will try to win gold at the @entity45 and dedicate it to my father , " he said .			0
