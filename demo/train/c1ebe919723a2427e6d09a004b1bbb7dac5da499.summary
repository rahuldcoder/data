-- @entity2 's slim early novel -- written in 1959 , when he was 22 , but only published 40 years later -- gets a dream screen treatment courtesy of producer - star @entity4 and " @entity6 " writer - director @entity5			1
by rights @entity4 -- who already played @entity2 's alter - ego @entity8 in @entity11 's grandly grotesque " @entity9 in @entity10 " -- should be too old to play the latest recruit on a failing @entity14 newspaper in @entity15 , @entity16			1
but even when he 's hung over and wretched ( which is often ) he easily passes for 30 , the age of the book 's " @entity20			0
" of course the fact that this engagingly left field movie has spent three years on the shelf helps			0
when @entity20 washes up in @entity15 , his greatest literary achievement is his resume			0
he 's promptly put on the astrology desk			0
but he 's hungry to make a name for himself , which gives him an edge over his pickled colleagues			0
it 's enough to attract the patronage of local wheeler - dealer @entity32 ( @entity34 ) , a property developer who has big plans for the island -- and his eye - catching girlfriend , @entity38 ( @entity38 )			1
it would be an exaggeration to call " @entity42 " a dry run for " @entity9 " ( and " dry " was n't really in @entity2 's vocabulary , though @entity20 does make vain promises to cut back on the hard stuff from time to time )			1
still , in @entity4 and @entity5 's hands you ca n't miss the roots of @entity49			1
this is more than ever the portrait of the artist as a young man -- fermented , refined and distilled from the book			0
compared to his cartoonish @entity8 ( or his @entity56 ) @entity4 's agreeably deadpan performance is scaled back several notches , though it 's hard to think of another movie heartthrob who uses his body to such clownish effect when the occasion arises			1
frequently shuttered behind a slick pair of shades , @entity20 is a stranger in paradise and not quite sure of his bearings yet			0
he 's an avid observer trying to figure out where a real writer might fit between the stinking shantytowns and the shiny luxury beach houses			0
@entity5 has no doubts about which side he 's on in that fight , and smuggles in pertinent asides on the parlous state of today 's heavily mortgaged newspaper business			0
vibrantly photographed by @entity78 , the movie lays on the local color with gusto -- we get fighting cocks , voodoo and carnival - but we also see broken down plumbing , simmering racial tension , permanent flop sweat and killer lines like @entity32 's , after @entity20 marvels at the beauty of the place : " it 's @entity91 's idea of money			1
" admittedly @entity20 's picaresque misadventures do n't add up to much of a plot -- the wheels come off in a climax that slouches off miserably in search of some future happy ending -- but there 's so much to enjoy along the way , the movie 's delayed release is hard to fathom			2
@entity4 's easy rapport with @entity105 , as photographer / sidekick @entity103 , is a low - key delight			1
i loved the way @entity34 's imperious uber - confidence slips where @entity38 is concerned ; and even anomalies like a jewel - encrusted tortoise ... " i got the idea from a book , " @entity32 explains -- as if it did			2
@entity5 has never topped the riotous comic miserabilism of his first film , the cult classic " @entity6 " -- he 's never even come close -- but " @entity42 " might be considered @entity118 after a 24 - year - long career hangover			2
he 's back in his debauched and debunking element , which is reason enough to celebrate .			2
