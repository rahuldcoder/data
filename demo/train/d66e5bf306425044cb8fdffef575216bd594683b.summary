-- what has @entity1 ever done to @entity3 ? ! did a young @entity3 try to meet @entity1 and @entity1 snubbed him ? did @entity1 in essence give @entity3 " the bird ' ? or was @entity3 just channeling his inner @entity6 ? for those who may have missed it , during last night 's presidential debate , @entity3 said that if elected president he would cut funding to @entity12			1
he even mentioned @entity1 by name			2
( this is even more shocking because @entity3 offered very few specifics on how he would cut the deficit other than slashing support for @entity12			1
) so what happens to @entity1 if @entity3 has his way ? will @entity1 be laid off ? what jobs are out there for an 8 - foot - 2 - inch yellow bird who sings slightly off - key ? will @entity1 become part of the 47 % that @entity3 talked about who believe they are victims and are entitled to government funding ? and what about the other @entity29 ? what will come of them ? how will they survive in this tough economic climate ? entertainment : celebs defend @entity1 to be honest , out of all of them , i think @entity38 and @entity39 ( who reminds me of @entity3 ) will probably fare the best			1
i always suspected they were financially astute			0
they probably have stocks , mutual funds and maybe even some off - shore investments in places like @entity46			0
but what about the rest of the @entity29 ? is there any doubt that @entity51 is living paycheck to paycheck ? will @entity51 turn to crime to support his habit ? will we see the count standing on the side of the road holding up a big sign that reads : " @entity56 " ? i do n't even want to think what will happen to mr. @entity61			1
what hope does a slow moving , wooly brown mammoth have in @entity3 's @entity65 ? ca n't @entity3 sit with the count and try to figure out a way to cut the deficit without cutting out @entity1 ? maybe @entity3 and the rest us simply had a different childhood			1
to be brutally honest , when i was a child , my family could n't afford day care and often tv was a substitute for that			2
the neighbor upstairs would be around for emergencies , but my sister and i would be plopped in front of the tv -- and particularly " @entity81			0
" political ticker : @entity1 mentions explode on @entity83 @entity1 and the @entity29 were not just a tv show to us -- they were , on some level , our friends			2
and more important , they taught us things before we ever stepped foot in school			0
i 'm pretty sure i learned about the letter " c " from @entity51			2
and there was the classic " three of @entity95 together , " teaching us about organization			0
and of course , @entity1 sang about the alphabet so that we understood that the @entity99 were individual letters and not one long word			0
apart from learning , @entity1 and his crew made us laugh -- from @entity104 singing about his rubber ducky to @entity106 singing about the struggles of being green			0
but @entity3 -- like the @entity108 -- would take that all away from the children of @entity65			0
ok , to be fair , @entity12 could exist without federal funding which amounts to about 15 % of its total budget			1
but funding has already been cut , and @entity12 has said this would eliminate programming in its smaller markets			1
@entity3 is not just after @entity1 -- in addition to @entity12 , he wants to cut all federal funding for the @entity120 and the @entity121			1
cutting all funding for the @entity123 , which helps fund @entity12 , would save only $ 450 million -- not much in the face of trillions of dollars			2
is this really the place @entity3 should be targeting ? @entity3 said last night he would not raise taxes , would cut corporate taxes , not cut @entity131 , not cut the defense budget and still reduce the deficit			2
even a @entity29 would call this fuzzy math. my hope is that @entity3 will take a few minutes off the campaign trail and sit with children who are watching @entity1 , @entity38 and the @entity51			1
watch the kids ' eyes light up as they see their favorite @entity29 on the screen			0
hear them giggle to the jokes or sing along in learning about the alphabet			0
perhaps then , @entity3 's heart will grow three sizes and he will give a reprieve to our 8 - foot yellow friend			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			0

@entity3 said he would cut funding to @entity12 , mentioning @entity1 by name
@entity152 asks , will @entity1 be one of the 47 % who believe they are victims ?
@entity152 says @entity51 is no doubt living paycheck to paycheck
he asks : should *public* tv really be @entity3 's target when it really wo n't save much ?
