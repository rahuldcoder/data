-- when senators @entity2 and @entity3 ran the @entity4 , partisan politics was nonexistent and the chamber ran with no hiccups			1
in the late 1990s and early 2000s , they dealt with president @entity9 's impeachment , controversial tax cuts , and welfare reform just to name a few contentious issues			0
but tuesday , the two former majority leaders said that partisanship has gotten so extreme that things need to change			1
" as we have seen throughout our careers , many political decision - makers increasingly favor partisan rancor over reasoned debate in discussing national policies , " @entity3 and @entity2 said in releasing a set of recommendations to turn things around in @entity19			1
@entity3 was the top @entity26 in the @entity4 from 1995 - 05 and @entity2 led @entity27 from 95 - 02			2
they served on a 29 - member committee along with other former members of @entity32 , @entity34 officials , business owners and academics formed to drum up solutions			2
the @entity39 's @entity38 offered changes to the legislative system and the electoral process , recommendations that @entity3 said are aimed at transforming @entity32 " into a high performing " entity			1
among the proposals : * @entity4 only be allowed to change its rules at the start of a session			1
the @entity50 - led @entity4 imposed controversial rule changes in the middle of the current session			2
* lawmakers return to a five - day work week			2
currently , the @entity34 and @entity4 mainly work three - day weeks			1
* @entity32 pass budgets every two years			2
currently , annual budget fights exacerbate partisanship			0
* @entity60 commissions oversee congressional redistricting every 10 years			0
currently , redistricting is conducted by the states based on census shifts every decade , so the time frame would n't change			0
but gerrymandering has created districts loyal to individual parties , which critics say limit competition and exacerbate partisanship			0
* create a national primary day and ease access to voting and registration			1
primaries are staggered nationally , and controversy has flared over @entity27 - led voter id campaigns , which critics say disenfranchises minorities			0
@entity81 , a moderate @entity27 who represented @entity83 in the @entity4 until 2012 , said she decided not to run for reelection when she realized she could not invoke change within the system because " partisanship and politics would not diminish			1
" she said increasingly partisan congressional districts have resulted in a noncompetitive general election , giving primaries an " outsized and disproportionate role " in politics			0
the low voter turnout in primaries results in a minority of people are determining who is elected to office , she said			0
writing the report is the easy part			0
the political heavy hitters plan to use their heft to push the ideas in @entity32 and state legislatures			1
@entity2 said that when he ran it by the current @entity4 leaders , @entity27 @entity110 and @entity26 @entity111 , they were " both moderately not happy			1
" that 's a good place to start , @entity2 said , grinning .			0

two former @entity4 leaders back a plan that would change the political system
recommendations *include* a national primary day and altering redistricting
they say @entity32 is *dysfunctional* and changes are needed to make it work
