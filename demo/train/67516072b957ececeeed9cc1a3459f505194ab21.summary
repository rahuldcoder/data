@entity0 -- @entity2 is a throwback to older , safer times when a knockabout @entity6 bloke could call a sheila " a good sort " and no one among those who understood the slang for a good - looking woman would blink			1
and it seems that much of @entity6 likes him that way -- the latest opinion polls have the 55 - year - old @entity6 conservative opposition leader set to be the country 's next prime minister after the federal election on september 7			1
never mind the fact @entity6 's first female prime minister , @entity20 , went viral with her damning misogyny speech about @entity2 in the @entity22 -- " i will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man			1
" never mind that a suitably solemn @entity2 sat across from the @entity26 as she listed statement after statement of his that cemented his sexist credentials			1
never mind that women around the world cheered to hear a female leader name it and shame it			0
at home , @entity20 's angry performance earlier this year proved to be nothing but a glancing blow			1
those women who had long loathed him as a sexist felt vindicated			2
some commentators tried to de-fang the attack by going to town on the fact @entity20 had conflated sexism and misogyny			1
but it was all water off the backs of those @entity6 who thought then , and now , it 's time for a change of government and @entity2 's attitude to women is not a significant issue			1
as veteran feminist @entity59 says : " he 's an ' old - fashioned ' sexist , not a woman hater			2
it 's just that he does n't get that equality means treating women as normal human beings			2
he ca n't resist making the odd sexist ha - ha comment			2
" his deputy @entity66 disagrees @entity2 is sexist			1
she told @entity68 's today program : " he 's always been very respectful and supportive of me and my other female colleagues			0
" a few months after her famous speech , @entity20 was ousted at the hands of her real rival , the former @entity26 prime minister @entity74 , whom she had helped to remove from office			2
as @entity20 now sits on the sidelines , possibly enjoying a small twinge of relief that she is no longer subjected to almost daily attacks on her appearance , her body shape and voice , @entity6 find themselves in the middle of a testosterone - fueled election campaign			1
yet strangely , as @entity74 exhorts @entity2 to " man up " and @entity2 demands his opponent " be man enough , " the campaign has placed sexism front and center once again			1
this week @entity2 was forced to dump a male candidate over a web forum which , according to media reports , included jokes about women making love on pool tables and " tit banter			1
" @entity2 , meanwhile , has suffered no harm electorally			2
he is an unreconstructed male who loves his sport , likes a beer and bravely tries to don the garb of man who cares about women -- in the right way			0
he now trots out one or several of his female family members , including his gay sister , to prove his credentials as a female - friendly politician			0
trouble is , he just keeps having " @entity114 moments			0
" on the campaign trail outside @entity0 last week he listed " sex appeal " as one of the key attributes of his party 's local candidate , @entity120			2
there was no mention of her mba or successful business career			0
he later described it as " exuberance " and a " dad moment " after his 20 - year - old daughter @entity130 told reporters : " @entity114 is running for prime minister so he ca n't have any sort of daggy [ uncool ] moments			0
everyone 's dad is daggy in their own sort of way at times			0
" his daughter 's comments took the sting out of @entity2 's gaffe and may have convinced a few female voters that he is trying hard to curb outbreaks of his old - school attitudes			1
@entity2 and his team appear to have decided that his sexist gaffes add to his knockabout " larrikin " charm -- always an asset for a successful male @entity6 politician -- and that a few lame " dad " comments will appeal to voters who also pull their rough - hewn males up in this way			1
it would explain why , a few days after his " sex appeal " moment , @entity2 was back in front of the cameras with @entity163 and , far from apologizing , he was on about her looks again			2
commenting on her answer to a question about his economic plan , he quipped : " obviously from that answer she ai n't just a pretty face			0
" @entity163 's response was on message			0
there was no need to apologize for an " absolutely charming compliment between friends			0
" now @entity2 has upped the ante for female voters , throwing on the table what is the most expensive siren call to them @entity6 has ever seen			1
it 's a policy which his minders no doubt hope will erase forever the lingering smear of sexism and misogyny			1
he is offering a generous -- extravagant even , according to economic commentators -- paid parental leave scheme that signals his deeply - held social policy ambitions and old - fashioned family values			0
the scheme has put him at odds with business groups and many in his own party who have failed to dissuade him from it			0
it has also led to claims from unions that the scheme is unfair to low - paid women			0
the a $ 5.5 billion ( us $ 5 billion ) scheme gives working mothers six months ' leave on full pay , capped at a salary of a $ 150,000 ( us $ 135,000 )			0
about half of the cost will be covered by a 1.5 % levy on taxable incomes over a $ 5 million ( us $ 4.5 million ) of the 3,000 largest @entity6 companies			2
this will be offset by a cut in company tax , but what has not been detailed is where the rest will come from , apart from '' associated reductions in other outlays			0
'' the announcement has had a mixed response from female commentators , with @entity59 declaring that the " shrill " criticism of the scheme by some feminists was personal , not political			0
" there are a lot feminist groups that are so anti-abbott that they are objecting to this because it 's come from him			0
" @entity230 publisher @entity229 , who published his book " battlelines , " agrees that @entity2 has been unpopular with women , but of his paid parental leave scheme she stated she was " in favor of anything that assists families to be with their children			2
" it is another nail in the coffin of the national conversation about women and leadership and sexism that @entity20 's show - stopping speech ignited but which died away with her departure from the political stage			1
a @entity250 poll this week confirmed that female @entity26 voters deserted @entity20 and have returned to the fold since @entity74 took over			1
@entity253 , 29 , told the @entity6 she had not backed @entity20 , but would be supporting @entity74			1
@entity20 , she said , had not been a role model for women " and she was n't charismatic ... she could have used her position as a woman more effectively and i never got the sense that she was herself			1
" @entity59 believes @entity20 's speech failed to ignite a national war on sexism because the former prime minister was not much of a feminist			1
" she was not a feminist leader			0
she did n't play the gender card -- although that was a plus			0
she was also not a promoter of the anti-sexist thing			0
she did n't make a big appeal to the women of @entity6 -- she did n't pitch for it			2
" a lot of women were passionate about supporting her , but they were in a minority , " says @entity59			0
it remains to be seen at the ballot box if @entity2 's multi-billion dollar policy pitch to women trumps any " embarrassing dad " sexist tendencies or female @entity26 voters ' preference for @entity74 over @entity20			1
but surely it says something about the level of " old fashioned " political debate in @entity6 when one of the country 's more colorful mining magnates , @entity290 , feels the need to stress his own candidacy with this tweet : " my hair is not as silky as @entity74 's and my body not as toned as @entity2 's but i offer common sense and real business experience # ausvotes			1

@entity6 leadership candidate has been *accused* of sexism , misogyny
polls show @entity2 is on track for an election *victory* on september 7
in 2012 , former *pm* @entity20 's attack on him in *parliament* went viral
@entity6 voters do n't seem disturbed by recent sexist gaffes
