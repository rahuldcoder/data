the august 2012 raids , in the town of @entity20 , on the @entity3 border with the @entity23 colony @entity24 , turned up evidence that the suspected terror cell had links in @entity7 and other @entity16 countries , the ministry said			1
that eventually led to the arrests tuesday			2

between 2008 and 2011 , he had operated in @entity48 and the @entity56 tribal territories of @entity60 , transiting between them , @entity52 said			0

both deny the charges against them and await trial			0
