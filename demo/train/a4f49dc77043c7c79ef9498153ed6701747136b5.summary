what the # @ ! % ? some gamers uploading r - rated videos of themselves playing on the new @entity3 are learning the hard way that @entity5 is trying to crack down on cursing			1
over the past few days , gamers using the @entity7 on @entity8 to share videos online have reported being banned from the network , at least temporarily , after using salty language			1
what do they think this is ? " @entity14 " ? on monday , @entity5 confirmed it 's trying to clean up language in its online community			1
" ( @entity17 ) e take @entity19 moderation via @entity7 very seriously			0
we want a clean , safe and fun environment for all users , " the company said in a statement			1
" excessive profanity as well as other @entity19 violations will be enforced upon and result in suspension of some or all privileges on @entity8			2
we remain committed to preserving and promoting a safe , secure and enjoyable experience for all of our @entity8 members			1
" the statement did , however , quell a rumor that @entity5 was also monitoring direct communications such as @entity33 chats among players using the network			1
because @entity33 often was one of the apps suspended , some players said they thought their behavior on the voice - calling service was being monitored			2
several suspended gamers reported having full services restored after 24 hours			1
not surprisingly , the announcement is n't going over well with some in the gaming community			0
" saying that swearing is not to be tolerated ( at least partially ) in this one area of gaming on top of a platform that is an obscenity cannon just feels squishy , " @entity45 wrote for @entity46			0
" also , it 's inconsistent			0
and as i do n't think that language deemed by some as ' foul ' should be banned while playing games , i do n't think that it should be banned in uploaded videos of games being played			2
" many online were echoing @entity45 's initial point : how can a company crack down on profanity while at the same time promoting video games filled with the stuff ? " @entity8 is suspending accounts for ( foul ) language			2
they do n't want kids hearing four letter words as they go on a virtual killing spree , " said @entity70 on @entity71			0
" if @entity3 is gon na ban 12 yr olds for abusive language they just eliminated their entire fan base , " added @entity71 user @entity76			0
in " @entity82 , " an exclusive title for the @entity3 , " the words " f * * k , " " sh * t , " and " a * shole " can be heard in the dialogue , " according to the game 's " @entity89 " rating from the @entity88			0
players are also able to visit a " xxx supply shop " and buy an adult toy that can be turned into the @entity93 -- a weapon that can be used on zombies			0
@entity5 said players who run afoul of its rules are being temporarily suspended from using certain apps , not banned from @entity8 indefinitely .			1
