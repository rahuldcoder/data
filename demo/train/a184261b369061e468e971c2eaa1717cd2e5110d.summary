@entity0 -- why was the euro created ? the euro , which created the world 's largest trading power , was designed to link together the @entity7 nations for trade and political purposes			1
it was born amid political and economic upheaval as @entity12 headed towards reunification -- with the collapse of the @entity15 in 1989 -- and communism disintegrated in @entity17			0
the @entity18 was put in place after @entity20 , but as the economic winds shifted the drive to create a single economic and political bloc intensified			0
the @entity24 , known as the @entity24 , was signed in the @entity26 city of @entity27 on february 7 , 1992 , before entering into force in 1993			1
it created the structure for a single currency , later named the euro , to be born			1
the currency 's symbol was inspired by the @entity36 letter epsilon , with the notes and coins available by 2001			1
they were issued by the @entity40 , which was based in @entity41 to placate @entity12 's loss of its beloved @entity43			1
but now the @entity7 dream -- which has the euro at its center -- has been hobbled			1
@entity48 members , led by @entity12 , are being forced to bail out the weaker economies in a financial crisis which is threatening the entire existence of the bloc			1
how does the euro work ? creating a currency which could be used across such disparate economies was always a difficult task			1
the idea for a single currency was promoted by @entity59 , a former @entity60 minister of finance , who held the @entity62 presidency from 1985 to 1995			0
the aim was to stamp a @entity7 identity in the markets , bringing , among other things , price stability , growth and trading benefits			0
the @entity59 report of 1989 defined a monetary union objective as being , in part , a " complete liberalization of capital movements			0
" the final structure was a bloc in which political and fiscal integration was minimal ; the euro was not designed to create a ' @entity79 ' of @entity17			1
instead the @entity24 created specific conditions for entry into the single currency			1
among other criteria , member countries must not allow annual budget deficits to exceed 3 % of gross domestic product , and public debt must be under 60 %			1
the bloc 's monetary policy was to be controlled by the @entity40 , which had a remit of setting interest rates and controlling inflation around 2 % or below			1
however , each country would retain its own tax policies , budgets and banks and issue their own bonds -- with prices varying depending on the risks investors associated with each country			0
who belongs to the eurozone ? of the 27 countries in the @entity18 , 17 nations -- comprising almost 332 million people -- use the euro as their currency			1
the eurozone 's biggest economy is @entity12 , followed by @entity60			1
the weaker economies are @entity36 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 , a group which gained the unwanted acronym @entity117 as the crisis unfolded			2
other members are @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , the @entity26 , @entity127 , @entity128 with the most recent edition , @entity130 , joining in january this year			0
@entity131 does not belong to the eurozone but is obligated to do so in the future , according to the terms of the treaty			2
those who do n't qualify for the euro , even though they are members of the @entity18 , are @entity139 , the @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , and @entity145			2
in 2000 @entity146 rejected the adoption of the euro in a referendum , while the @entity150 also stayed out			2
why did n't the @entity150 want to belong to the eurozone ? debate over joining the single currency was fierce			2
@entity154 , conservative prime minister from 1979 to 1990 , was anti-euro			0
the @entity155 remained largely euroskeptic under @entity154 's successor , @entity156			2
then came @entity157 , the day in 1992 on which @entity150 was forced to halt its membership of euro 's precursor , the @entity161			1
@entity157 was seen as proof a monetary union and @entity7 currency could not work , says @entity165 , research professor of economics at @entity168 's @entity167			2
adding to the political humiliation , @entity157 is also remembered as the day which enabled investor @entity170 to collect an estimated $ 1 billion in profits from betting against the pound			2
@entity176 's @entity175 government , which succeeded @entity156 's @entity178 government , was in favor of joining the euro , but only if certain economic tests were met			1
they were n't , and the @entity150 stayed out			0
@entity176 reiterated his support of the euro in an interview with the @entity186 this year , but said the case for @entity150 was not compelling			2
public opinion polls have showed opposition to adopting the currency at up to 75 %			0
according to @entity165 , @entity150 " has always had the problem of wanting to be a part of @entity17 , without really signing up for the @entity7 project			0
" what was the issue with @entity36 ? the @entity36 economy has been in trouble since the country joined the euro , due to a mix of overspending and inability to raise enough revenue			1
in 2004 , it admitted that the country 's financial position was worse than reported and had breached the eurozone entry requirements			1
by 2008 the government had narrowly passed a belt - tightening budget , designed to trim its massive national debt burden , triggering massive protests			2
in 2009 , @entity36 admitted its deficit would be more than 12 % of gross domestic product -- far higher than previous estimates and more than four times the requirements of entry into the eurozone			2
the country was hit with ratings downgrades , pushing its sovereign bonds into so - called " junk " territory , and the damage continued to spiral			0
despite the introduction of brutal austerity measures -- which have prompted waves of violent protests -- @entity36 has been unable to balance its books			0
there is a risk it could be forced out of the eurozone			0
why is the eurozone cracking ? @entity36 's shifting economic data created panic among investors , who stopped buying its bonds , making it impossible to fund itself			1
in may 2010 , @entity36 received a â ‚ ¬ 110 billion bailout from the @entity240 and its eurozone partners			0
a @entity7 bail - out fund was then set up to enable a more organized response to subsequent emergencies			0
the fund was quickly tapped again as turmoil gripped the markets			0
@entity113 's banks were revealed to be a black hole of cash and it was forced to tap the fund for cash			1
@entity112 followed , then @entity36 returned for more financial help			0
while the countries which have been bailed out have specific problems -- @entity36 's lax tax collection , and @entity113 's black hole of a banking system , for example -- the problem has been exacerbated by a currency which shackles the weak to the strong , economists say			1
political difficulties in driving through a decisive plan for reining in the crisis has fed the panic			0
what happens if a member defaults ? nobody really knows , and the uncertainty has fed massive volatility in both the credit and equity markets across the world , driving the costs of global stocks dramatically lower and pushing both @entity17 and the @entity79 -- which is also facing massive financial problems -- toward another recession			0
the return of a recession will likely create increased unemployment and lower wages			0
a default by @entity36 , or its departure from the eurozone , also carries contagion risk			0
that means investors will worry about other nations in trouble -- such as @entity114 , which makes up 17 % of the eurozone economy , nearly seven times bigger than the economy of @entity36 -- and further increase financial instability across the globe			1
politically , it will ignite the debate about whether the @entity7 dream , and the euro , can survive , and if it should have even been created in the first place .			0

the @entity24 which enabled the euro 's creation was signed in 1992
the euro was available as cash by 2001
it is used over the eurozone 's 17 countries
but it is under pressure due to the eurozone 's debt crisis
