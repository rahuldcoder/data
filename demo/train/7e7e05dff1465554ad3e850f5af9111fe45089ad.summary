-- today , president @entity1 and @entity3 president @entity2 signed a treaty fixing a ceiling for each country of 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 deployed nuclear delivery vehicles			1
the new limits are about a third lower than the previous ones negotiated by @entity11 in the 2002 @entity12 of 2,200 per side			2
now that the new treaty is signed , it will be against the law for a president to deploy 1,600 warheads -- unless he first withdraws from the treaty			2
but a new " counting rule " undercuts the significance of @entity1 and @entity2 's achievement			1
each bomber counts as only one warhead , even though each might be able to carry as many as 20 warheads			0
@entity29 's premiere independent expert on the @entity29 nuclear arsenal , @entity31 , of the @entity32 , said " the paradox is that with the " fake " bomber counting rule , the @entity29 and @entity3 could , if they chose , deploy more strategic warheads under the @entity36 by 2017 than would have been allowed by the @entity12 by 2012			1
" on the other hand , almost all arms - control advocates acclaim the new inspection procedures , which lay a strong foundation for future treaties			2
the @entity12 , by contrast , virtually did away with inspections			0
it seemed designed to cancel hopes for any future for arms control			0
debates about the size of the cuts are certainly worth having			2
but they distract from a glaring reality contained in the treaty that is more important and in many ways more surprising			2
the treaty does cut a few hundred warheads , but at the same time it sanctions and , so to speak , blesses , many more -- namely the 1,550 that are permitted			0
this hard fact points to a startling truth : every decade or so , @entity61 and @entity62 sit down and jointly decide that they would like to go on holding one another hostage to mutual annihilation by nuclear arms			0
they ratify the balance of nuclear terror born in the @entity70			1
why ? during the @entity70 , no one had to ask			1
the two superpowers were involved in a global confrontation			0
but once the @entity70 and the @entity75 ended , the arrangement became downright weird			1
was there something in the wary @entity29 - @entity3 friendship of the 1990s or the mild rivalry of the new century that warranted threats of mutual annihilation ? the question is almost never asked			1
certainly , it has never been adequately answered			0
does anyone in the @entity29 want to be in the cross hairs of thousands of @entity3 nuclear weapons ? do we want to thus target @entity3 ? who would answer " yes " to either question ? the geopolitical revolution of 1989 - 1991 had no visible effect on the strategic precincts where the number of deaths in a nuclear war are reckoned			1
the two arsenals , and the arms control agreements that went with them , sailed on into the new era disconnected from political goals or realities			0
@entity70 , some say , is politics conducted by other means			1
but what is this ? true , each time the negotiating teams have met , the cuts have been substantial			0
at the height of the @entity70 , the two countries jointly possessed some 70,000 warheads			1
now we 're down to some 20,000			0
( the difference from the 1,550 figure for each side is accounted for by warheads held in storage )			0
two cheers for that ! but the @entity70 figures were so high that the @entity29 and @entity3 could cut warheads by the hundred or by the thousand for decades and still be capable of wiping each other out many times over			1
consider the 1,550 , for example			0
one hundred warheads used against the hundred largest cities of either country would spell the effectual end of that country			1
that means that the current figure leaves a factor of overkill of at least 15 -- and more if the thousands of stored warheads are counted			0
the cut of a few hundred warheads is a success			0
but the survival , 20 years after the end of the @entity70 , of the 1,550 that each country still points at the other is a gross failure that outweighs it by far			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148			2

@entity148 says @entity29 - @entity3 treaty lowers ceiling for each country 's nuclear arsenals
but " counting rule " undercuts new limits , *theoretically* allows more weapons , he says
cuts are welcome , he says , but why *continue* balance of terror long after @entity70 's end ?
@entity148 : existence of thousands of nukes is failure that outweighs treaty 's *acheivement*
