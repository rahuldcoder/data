the 2016 presidential race is n't an abstract parlor game anymore			0
with a seven - paragraph @entity5 post on tuesday , @entity3 instantly transformed the nascent campaign			1
his decision to " actively explore " a presidential bid accelerates the scramble for donors			0
it also gives the former @entity13 governor time to figure out how to overcome suspicion in the @entity15 base while positioning himself as the establishment candidate in a fragmented field			0
the pre-holiday timing of the announcement was a big surprise to many beyond @entity3 's tight inner circle			1
most of the political spotlight has been on @entity26 this year , leaving @entity28 donors to sit back , hedge their bets and watch the field develop			0
but @entity3 's decision to make a move now -- 13 months ahead of the @entity33 caucus -- speaks to the complicated political decisions facing potential 2016 @entity28 candidates			1
they can maintain the coy stance of insisting they have n't made a decision on running , wait out the calendar and hopefully avoid a long , bruising primary like the one that left @entity44 damaged in 2012			1
or they can start the work now to capture the staff and donors that can take on the @entity51 machine			0
@entity3 chose option @entity53 after all , many @entity28 donors and operatives , who have serious doubts about much of the field but remain uneasy about the prospect of a bruising primary , have been waiting for a clear signal from either @entity3 or @entity44 , who is being pressured by many of his longtime supporters to make a third presidential run			1
@entity3 , until recently , seemed unsure about confronting the rigors of a race			1
@entity66 , who chaired sen. @entity68 's 2008 presidential run , said that prompted his potential opponents who were jockeying for establishment - minded donors to raise doubts about his interest in the race -- doubts that seemed to motivate @entity3 to plant a flag			1
" some of the other candidates out there have been competing for some of those dollars and some of those donors — and some of them have been implying here and there that @entity3 was n't interested , " he said			1
now @entity3 has signaled he 's serious and can begin to lock down commitments from those donors — making it a tougher race for many of his opponents			1
@entity3 " froze the donor sector of the hidden primary , " said @entity13 - based @entity15 strategist @entity89 , noting that by stepping one foot into the race so early @entity3 has created a far steeper climb for @entity93 gov. @entity92			1
" all those @entity97 donor types who absolutely loved @entity92 a year and a half ago , and cooled off to him a year ago , are now not returning his phone calls			1
they kept seeing it over and over again			0
" there are grave concerns within the @entity15 about whether @entity92 can recover from the @entity105 scandal and whether voters will appreciate his bravado			2
centrist @entity15 view @entity109 sen. @entity108 with skepticism , despite his grassroots base and determined drift toward more palatable positions on foreign policy			0
while @entity116 gov. @entity115 appears to be making all the right moves -- enlisting tutors and meeting with activists — he has yet to convince the party faithful that he can pick up the pieces from his disastrous 2012 run			2
other potential candidates like @entity13 sen. @entity124 have intrigued @entity15 voters , but still have a long way to go before demonstrating they can command the field			0
@entity129 , a close @entity130 ally and @entity28 lobbyist , said he does n't believe @entity44 will run if @entity3 becomes the clear frontrunner in the race			1
" i 've spoken with @entity44 , who i consider to be a great friend and a great leader , about 2016 , and i 've always been under the assumption if people he trusts like @entity3 decide to run that he would not decide to do that , " he said			1
watch : @entity3 45 ? but other operatives close to @entity44 said tuesday they did not think @entity3 's decision would foreclose a @entity44 run			1
that could create a situation where donors remain on the sidelines well into the spring to avoid choosing sides			0
though the two men have expressed mutual admiration for one another , they are not close			0
by announcing the formation of a leadership pac and signaling his intentions so early , @entity3 at once acknowledged his considerable advantages and vulnerabilities -- including his positions on immigration and education reforms -- as he mulls a final decision			1
he comes to the race with a committed core of donors , who date back to his father and brother 's bids for the @entity166 , and his allies have been building the @entity169 finance team now for several months			2
@entity3 's establishment of a leadership pac — a step that falls well short of a formal exploratory committee — will also allow him to travel freely to early primary states to test the length of his brother 's shadow on his potential presidential campaign			1
fatigue from the @entity3 years , stemming from the expansion of federal spending and the @entity183 military entanglements in @entity184 and @entity185 , was a huge drag on @entity15 in 2006 and 2008			2
but @entity188 's favorability ratings have rebounded since they hit their low of 32 % in april 2008 , according to polling by @entity191			2
earlier this year , a @entity191 survey showed that 53 % of @entity183 voters now view @entity188 favorably			0
former president @entity195 's approval ratings in that survey — 63 % — were just a point shy of the high marks given to former president @entity51			2
still some @entity15 did not mince words on tuesday about the drawbacks of the @entity3 name			2
" i ca n't see the country electing another @entity3 , " @entity203 @entity202 told reporters off the @entity206 floor			2
" i love @entity3 — i think he 's a nice guy			1
i just ca n't see it			0
" " there are still hard feeling about @entity188 , " @entity202 continued			0
" so you start out with a negative - ( because ) you 've got the wrong last name			0
if he did n't have that last name he 'd be a pretty good candidate			0
" still , there is a large cadre of former @entity3 donors who backed @entity44 in 2012 , and the former @entity13 governor now can test their willingness to come back into the fold -- even as a @entity44 run hangs as a possibility			1
of equal importance , @entity3 now has a long lead time to confront the most formidable challenge facing his bid : winning over core @entity15 activists in the early states of @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 who vehemently disagree with his moderate stance on immigration reform and his support for @entity239 educational standards			1
he signaled his strategy on that front -- and the fact that he will not be cowed by activists hostile to his bid -- during a @entity247 ceo @entity245 meeting earlier this month when he said the @entity28 presidential nominee should n't violate their principles to win the primary			2
by giving himself a year to begin the courtship of activists in @entity231 , @entity232 and other early states , former @entity232 @entity28 committeeman @entity255 said , @entity3 " is taking these issues on and letting them play out -- and they typically lose a lot of their punch when they are played out and discussed over time ... this gives a lot of time to let the air go out of some of those balloons			1
" " if you look at the race basically as geography , he defines a very important part of that geography : the center - right governing conservative spot on the map , " added @entity255 , who supported @entity44 in 2008 and 2012 , " and that typically is the person that we nominate			2
" @entity33 political observer @entity278 , said @entity3 's announcement caught many @entity15 activists in @entity231 off guard because he has spent so little time there , but it was viewed tuesday as a wise move			1
" he needs a longer period of time to communicate to people where he is on education			0
he 's going to have to explain what he wants to happen on immigration , " said @entity278 , former political director of the @entity28 and editor of the @entity231 @entity15 , a website			0
" there 's really only one spot for an establishment candidate in @entity231 ...			0
and it 's as wide open as it 's ever been			0
" @entity298 , a @entity15 strategist , noted that @entity3 's early decision will allow him to lock down staff with expertise in those key states , who can begin the easing the concerns of activists in earnest -- highlighting his conservative record as governor of @entity13 and tackling questions about his current positioning on education and immigration			1
" every single candidate has an ' oppo ' book with their name on the front cover , " @entity298 said			0
" the difference between those candidates winning and losing is the team you put together and the strategy that you execute to overcome many of those vulnerabilities and put yourself in a position to win			0
" @entity232 senator @entity326 hinted at the difficulty of that spade work ahead for @entity3 and all of the 2016 candidates in an interview tuesday			2
" he has n't really been to @entity232 yet , " she said when asked about @entity3 's announcement			1
" i do n't care who you are , you have to do the hard work in @entity232 ...			0
obviously , coming into it with the @entity3 name , he 'll have name recognition			2
but i think everyone will get an open vetting in @entity232			0
" @entity1 's @entity343 , @entity344 and @entity345 contributed to this report .			0

with early announcement , @entity3 sets his mark on money and activists
setting his mark , @entity3 sets up steep climb for @entity92
@entity44 's shadow still lingers over @entity3
