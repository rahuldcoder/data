@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 keeps a handful of photos of her little brother in a faded yellow envelope			2
she has a black - and - white snapshot of him as a baby and some color portraits of him as a successful banker in @entity13 , @entity14			2
and then there 's one of him as a 7 - year - old , about to be airlifted out of @entity1			1
that was the last time she ever saw him			2
" i went to the airport to see him off , " the @entity23 filmmaker said at her @entity0 home			1
her brother @entity27 was one of 14,000 @entity23 children quietly sent to the @entity29 between 1960 and 1962 , at the start of @entity32 's revolution			1
their parents were terrified the new government would strip them of parental authority and ship their kids off to work camps in what was then the @entity40 , or send them into the countryside on literacy campaigns			2
those fears deepened when the state nationalized industries , confiscated private property and closed religious and private schools			0
" our parents thought they would soon join my brother or that this government would n't last , " @entity48 said			0
" my father thought , ' @entity29 wo n't put up with this radical revolution			1
' " her parents wanted to send @entity48 , then 11 , but she refused to go			0
the clandestine program came to be known as @entity57			1
it was backed by @entity59 and coordinated by the @entity60 , which helped @entity23 children get @entity29 visas and once in @entity29 , find a family or go to foster homes or orphanages			1
but things did n't play out as expected			0
to begin with , a @entity68 - backed invasion failed to topple @entity32			1
with the subsequent cuban missile crisis , relations between @entity0 and @entity59 broke off completely , making travel and even communication almost impossible			0
many parents could n't get @entity29 visas , and others could n't get permission to leave @entity1			1
latin pop star @entity76 and former @entity29 sen. @entity77 of @entity14 are perhaps the best - known of the " @entity57 " kids			1
the operation inspires mixed feelings			1
many @entity23 exiles argue that the airlift saved children who might have died trying to escape on rafts or grown up under a repressive regime			1
others say the clandestine program put many kids at unnecessary risk , with a few suffering abuse in foster homes and orphanages			0
@entity93 was airlifted out when she was just 14			0
she did n't come back to @entity1 for more than 30 years but now visits frequently and promotes cultural and religious exchanges			0
" i will always respect my parents ' decision , because they made it at a juncture in time that was when their whole world was falling apart , " she said			0
her parents managed to get coveted @entity29 visas a year later and moved to @entity14			1
" i think at the end of the day we were pawns between political powers , two countries			0
" but it took years for other families to be reunited , and 20 percent of the children never saw their parents again			1
@entity48 's brother @entity27 drifted from home to home , and his family eventually gave up trying to join him			2
" he felt so alone that he wrote to my mother , filling pages with the same sentence : come @entity119			0
come @entity119 , " she said			0
in 1993 , @entity27 died			0
he was only in his 30s			0
" when the bureaucratic hurdles started to ease , it was too late			2
my brother was already sick			0
my mother had already died without ever seeing him again , " she said			0
@entity48 started work on a documentary about the exodus a year later			2
politics still divide the countries , but many families touched by @entity57 have started to reach out to people and places they thought they had lost			1
last year , president @entity133 lifted restrictions on allowing @entity23 - @entity29 to visit relatives in @entity1 and made it easier for them to send money to relatives .			1

14,000 @entity23 children sent to @entity29 at start of @entity32 's revolution
mixed feelings remain about @entity145 @entity57
some families were never reunited
others have started to reach out again as restrictions are lifted
