as the two teams knelt in prayer at the end of the game , many of the more than 97,000 faithful fans in attendance proudly sang the school 's alma mater			1
forging a new meaning for the rally cry ' we are ... @entity5 ' in the student section at one end zone , students , many of whom had camped out for first - row seats since wednesday night , stood shoulder to shoulder with their arms around each other as they belted out the words			1

" @entity5 scandal : where things stand the team had the full support of alumni from near and far and the boisterous cheers from the student section			1
they led into the third quarter and gassed out , losing 24 - 14			0
it was a disappointing outcome for the team , though there were many things stacked against them from the start			1

when the hero falls off the pedestal and in the third quarter it showed			0
costly errors , missed tackles and fumbled passes got the best of them			0
but @entity4 put the blame entirely on himself , falling on the sword in a press conference after the game			0
" i think we all got ta coach better and that starts with me , " he told a packed room of reporters			1
" i got ta coach a lot better			1
" while he may be right and there are still kinks to work out , the scoreboard at the end of the game told only part of the story			0

on friday night the school held its @entity153 pep rally to get students and alums pumped about the new season			1
after nine months of clouds hanging over them they were ready to get the season -- and in many ways the healing -- started			1
they knew that together they have something to prove to the world			0
and they were ready to take the first major step toward writing a new chapter for the storied football team			2
the same could be said about the crowd saturday afternoon , even after losing to a team in a mid-major conference for the first time in a home opener since the 1960s			1
while there were looks of disappointment , the overall enthusiasm did not waver even ask the clock ticked down with @entity182 in the lead			0
chants of " we are @entity5 ! " and " @entity4 ! " rocked the stadium			1
@entity5 's student section , known for being one of the most passionate in the nation , stood the entire game cheering the team on until the very last moment			1
that passion , and more importantly , the support was not lost on @entity4			0
and although he appeared stoic during the press conference , he made sure to acknowledge how much it meant to him			0
" i thought it was a great atmosphere , " he said			0
" i think it was a good crowd and just want them to keep coming and support the football team			2

" as they exited the stadium , many of them said it was a good game and a good start for the team and pledged to be there for them as they seek to get stronger , become more cohesive and move toward even more important games			2
shortly before the game @entity214 stood outside the stadium in glasses with the paws of the @entity9 on her face			0
she 's put them on for 18 seasons ' worth of home games , most of them victories that were vacated as part of @entity87 sanctions against the school			2
none of that -- and nothing that follows -- will change that , she says			2
" we 've been here for 50 years and it 's been a lot of changes , and we have been hurt by many , many things			2
but no matter what , we will always be here for this football team			2
and we will be here for @entity4 -- win , lose or draw			2
we 're here for the long haul			0
" that 's exactly the kind of support @entity4 hopes he can count on and may need as the team looks forward to a tougher schedule			1
