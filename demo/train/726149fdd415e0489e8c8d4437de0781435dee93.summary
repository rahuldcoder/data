-- @entity1 , the @entity2 boy whose killing has enraged , mobilized and emboldened the country 's opposition movement , once harbored dreams of being a police officer			1
but the 13 - year - old changed his ambitions when the government crackdown went into full swing			0
" when he saw police officers kill the people in the revolution , he would say , ' the police kill the people and i do n't want to be like them			0
i do not know what i will be but the police kill people and torture them , ' " according to one of his relatives , who escaped to @entity24 amid the regime 's suppression of protesters			1
the relative asked not to be named out of fear for the safety of his family in @entity33 , the southwestern city where the anti-regime demonstrations started in mid-march			2
family members say @entity1 got separated from his father in the chaos during demonstrations around @entity33 on april 29 , when protesters marched on the city to break the @entity2 military siege and force the delivery of important supplies , such as medicine and milk for babies			1
a few weeks ago , the family received the boy 's body			2
a video that showed up on @entity50 displays an appalling and mutilated corpse ; much of the video is too graphic to broadcast			0
the face is bloated and purple and his body is covered in bruises			0
there are gunshot wounds to his torso and his genitals are mutilated			0
@entity0 can not independently verify what happened to @entity1 or the authenticity of the video			1
his death has punctuated the domestic and international outcry against the clampdown by president @entity70 's government against peaceful protests			2
" i can only hope that this child did not die in vain , " @entity73 secretary of state @entity72 said this week			0
@entity76 , a spokesman for the @entity79 children 's agency , @entity77 , said children are not immune to the civil unrest across the region			1
" the pictures are shocking			0
they have gone all over the world			0
and no one could see that without being deeply moved and ashamed about what happened to that boy , " he said			2
" i have no idea why anybody would brutalize a young boy like that			2
i can not even begin to go there			0
we just know that somehow it happened			0
" @entity77 is calling for investigations so the perpetrators can be brought to justice , " some sort of justice in a situation that 's volatile , " @entity98 said			1
" we want to get to the bottom of it			0
" the relative , interviewed thursday by @entity0 , described @entity1 as a smart kid who loved school and soccer , and who was raised in a modest setting where he was the youngest child of a laborer			1
" he was only 13 years old but he had the maturity of a 30 - year - old , " the relative said			2
the boy supported the demonstrations and would refuse to eat during the military 's late april siege in @entity33 because others did n't have food and he felt it would be unfair to eat while they went hungry			1
@entity1 would accompany his family to protests , waving a @entity2 flag and chanting , " no @entity127 and @entity128			1
we want freedom , " the relative said			2
the relative said he , @entity1 and other members of their extended family took to the streets on the day the boy got lost and apparently swept up by @entity2 officials			1
children accompanied the marchers , the relative said , because " we did not expect people to shoot			2
" " @entity1 was among the children and carried a small @entity2 flag with three stars , the flag of @entity2 independence			1
" after he went missing , his family searched for days but failed to find him			0
eventually , another relative got a tip that @entity1 was being held in prison , saw the boy alive and well , and begged the security forces to free him			1
security officials asked @entity1 's family to return in two days and said they would release the teen			1
however , the first relative told @entity0 , " the security forces were angry at us , asking how we found out where @entity1 was and infuriated that we had found him			1
then they tortured the poor boy for two days			2
" when the parents went to the prison , security officials told them to go to the hospital			0
that 's where they found the corpse			0
" we went to the hospital and what we saw was horrific			0
his mother had a nervous breakdown			0
these are people who are not afraid of @entity178 who do not know @entity178 , " the relative said of the security officials			1
the family took @entity1 back to his village for burial and held a wake in the child 's honor			1
" his father was destroyed and his mother seemed to have lost her sanity crying for him one minute and then yelling shrills of joy for his martyrdom the next , " the relative said			2
the relative said that the night the family received the body , @entity1 's father was arrested and taken away by security forces			1
the security forces threatened him and told him not to speak to any media outlets , human rights organizations or anyone else			0
" they told him we have killed one of your children and we can kill the rest of them too , " he said			2
@entity2 state tv on tuesday ran a segment in which a person identified as the medical examiner in the case said the body 's injuries were sustained when the boy was alive , but there was no evidence on the surface of the body that the boy had been subjected to torture , violence or retaliation			2
the medical examiner said proper procedures to identify the body were followed after the body first arrived , and went on to describe how a body deteriorates in phases after death , turning dark brown , for example , with parts becoming enlarged			0
the boy 's death , he said , was the result of the three gunshot wounds he sustained			1
@entity237 also said @entity70 met with members of @entity1 's family on tuesday , and it showed men it identified as the boy 's father and uncle who said that @entity70 was very welcoming and understanding , and promised reform			1
the relative had fled @entity2 by the time state tv aired the video of the father and uncle thanking @entity70			1
but , he said , " i swear to you they said this because they were threatened			0
they told him they would kill his children and destroy his family			0
they forced him to say this			0
" the man said he is very concerned about the issue of child victims and feels the regime was purposely targeting children to " teach us a lesson			0
" " there is not just one @entity1 in @entity2 , " the relative told @entity0			1
" there are hundreds of @entity272 , and these men do not know @entity178 so they will make a hundred more @entity274			1
" @entity0 's @entity275 contributed to this report .			0
