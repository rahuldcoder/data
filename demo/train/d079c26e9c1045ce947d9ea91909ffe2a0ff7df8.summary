-- when @entity2 announced late last year they 'd be taking up temporary residency in @entity4 at the @entity5 , it was one of those ideas that seemed so perfect the only question was , " what took so long ? " this was , after all , a band whose celebration of the rock & roll lifestyle has been immoralized in a book and may still make it to film			1
so , what better place to lay down roots -- even for just a few weeks -- than in a town nicknamed @entity22 ? as they hyped the residency , @entity2 promised not just the usual exploits but to take the pyro and girls , girls , girls to new levels of excess			1
when it kicked off this past weekend , the debauchery was no greater than usual -- women on stage several times throughout the show , aerialists and lots of confetti and pyro , but no more craziness than a typical @entity2 show			1
after saturday 's show , drummer @entity40 told @entity0 the band is still working out the logistics			1
" we 're doing production s * * t right up until doors open , f * * * * * * crazy , " @entity40 said			1
" but it 's getting better			0
it 's gon na be sick in another show or two			0
" the band has decided to push their creativity and musicality			1
there were , of course , many of the expected hits , from " @entity58 , " " @entity59 " and " @entity60 " to " @entity61 , " " @entity62 " and the closing " @entity63 , " which began with @entity40 on a piano that descended from the ceiling			1
frontman @entity66 had his own @entity68 moment , sailing over the crowd during the song			0
but there were also unexpected moments , including a brief acoustic set in the middle of the show that found them all huddled together in a similar manner to @entity79 's stripped - down concert interludes			0
for the saturday night performance , the @entity2 turned three songs , starting with " on with the show " and wrapping with " @entity82 ) , " into acoustic numbers			1
" doing the acoustic thing for us is something we 've been wanting to do forever , " @entity40 said			2
another new aspect of the performance was the inclusion of a narrator , @entity91 , who worked his way through the crowd and stage , introducing the band members and providing occasional levity between songs			0
it 's another new feature @entity40 was excited about			2
" being able to work the room with @entity91 , our @entity2 , we 've never done anything like that in an arena , having people pop up here and there , " @entity40 said			1
the quartet is using the stay at the @entity110 to live out some performance fantasies			2
" we 're able to place things strategically in the best place in the room , which we would n't really be able to do in arenas , " @entity40 says			2
" being in one place for a while , we 're able to really figure out how to use this building			0
it 's been fun , interesting			0
" the @entity110 shows run through february 19 , but @entity40 hopes the band can take lessons from the residency with them on the road			1
" now we kind of know what we 're getting into here			0
hopefully this 'll set up something else in a bigger venue , a different place , " he says			0
" you just never know			0
