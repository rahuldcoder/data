their presence at the @entity13 has reverberated across @entity1 and is a " big statement " for the democratic society and the rule of law , said @entity37 , a @entity1 political scientist and a high court advocate			1
" it is an indication that yes , responsibility and public action is possible where it is deemed that crimes have happened ; where it is deemed that some people need to be taken to account for their actions , " he said			2
" i think that is a good statement in a political scene such as @entity1 's , and perhaps @entity50 generally , because we have known impunity to thrive , we have known leadership to be unaccountable , and this is a statement that says , ' wait , you better be ready to account for your actions			1
' " the two groups of three come from opposite sides in the country 's disputed presidential election			0

" it came to the knowledge of the chamber through following some articles in the @entity1 newspapers that there are movements toward retriggering the violence in @entity1 , by way of delivering dangerous speeches , " the judge said			2
@entity1 has challenged the jurisdiction of the @entity12 , saying its own authorities will investigate and prosecute the cases on @entity1 soil			2
@entity37 said the case is " most important " because it draws a line for @entity1			1
" it says that ' wait a minute , you can not go about your business and commit all crimes , and do whatever you want to do all in the name of acquiring power , and get away with it , ' " he said			0
