@entity24 , @entity25 : your commercial - free source for classroom news is pondering probes , planets and pumas ! i 'm @entity33			2
first up : interrogation report @entity35 : first up , the @entity4 government launches an investigation into methods used by the @entity6 to question suspects			1
attorney general @entity40 , the country 's top law enforcement officer , said he knew it would raise controversy when he announced the investigation yesterday , but he 's seen enough information to move forward			1
that information comes from a report written by the @entity6 in 2004 about the techniques used by some of its agents			1
former president @entity51 authorized what were called " enhanced interrogation " methods after the september 11th attacks			1
those methods were used on suspected terrorists			1
the @entity6 report refers to some of the techniques that were used as unauthorized			1
attorney general @entity40 's investigation is looking into whether or not the interrogations were illegal			1
the @entity6 says it did n't endorse any behavior that went outside the bounds of official guidelines			1
@entity40 says this investigation will not focus on the people who carried out the questioning , who were following the guidance of the @entity51 administration			1
the second most powerful person in that administration , vice president @entity75 , says that the interrogation methods and the program as a whole were needed to keep the country safe			1
former u.s. vice president dick cheney : the intelligence officers who questioned the terrorists can be proud of their work and proud of the results , because they prevented the violent death of thousands , perhaps hundreds of thousands of people			1
@entity35 : attorney general @entity40 is also considering the country 's safety , and says the investigation wo n't pose a threat to it			1
@entity4 @entity92 , @entity40 : we will not be doing anything that would endanger the @entity4 people or in some way lessen our national security			1
new interrogation @entity35 : in the meantime , president @entity99 is making a change when it comes to who handles the questioning of suspected terrorists			1
that responsibility is shifting from the @entity6 to the @entity107 and a special unit of terrorist interrogators			1
the change is based on a recommendation of a task force that the president created after he took office			2
the new unit will make sure that future interrogations meet certain restrictions outlined in a @entity119 manual			0
is this legit ? @entity120 , @entity25 : is this legit ? there are officially nine planets in our solar system			0
not legit ! according to the @entity126 , there are eight planets , after @entity128 was downgraded three years ago			0
pondering @entity128 @entity35 : two @entity4 states -- @entity130 and @entity131 -- have voted to re-instate @entity128 's status as a planet			1
three years ago , the @entity126 voted that @entity128 was a dwarf planet , and that knocked it off the list of official planets			0
so , what is a planet ? one : it orbits the sun. two : it must be nearly round			0
three : there ca n't be other objects in its path			0
that last one was the sticking point ; @entity128 's orbit has ice and rocks in its path			1
other scientists argue that any round object that orbits the sun should be a planet , and that would include @entity128			0
@entity11 @entity155 @entity35 : moving from planets to plant life , or the lack of it			1
it 's a problem in parts of @entity11 , and it 's being caused by a process called desertification			1
that 's when plants and soil dry up and the land turns into a desert			1
@entity168 examines the impact that this is having in the @entity172 nation , not just on the plants , but on the people			1
( begin video ) @entity168 , @entity176 correspondent : this is a typical dust storm : the unnatural and eerie orange glow , minimal visibility as suffocating tiny particles stirred up by desert winds descend on the people , causing obvious respiratory health concerns			1
over the last few years , the frequency and intensity of these storms have increased , and experts say that 's an indication of a much more ominous problem : the desertification of @entity11			1
@entity192 , @entity193 : " this is a real catastrophe , " @entity190 of @entity11 's agriculture ministry says , " because this crisis threatens food security in this country			1
" @entity198 : @entity11 was among the region 's most fertile areas thanks to the flowing rivers of the @entity202 and the @entity203			1
but take a look at the @entity203 today : it 's anything but flowing			2
in fact , no one who we have spoken to has ever seen its levels this low			0
@entity209 and his father take us on a tour of their once fertile land , which has been in the family for generations			0
they show us their now dying crops			0
@entity221 , farmer : " the risk with the increase of desertification , " he explains , " is that farmers will leave their farms and start looking for new jobs			2
" @entity198 : their farm , for example , only produces around 50 percent of what it used to , barely enough to feed and clothe this extended family of 45 that relies on these lands			0
@entity236 , @entity222 : " there has been no rain in the past three years , " @entity209 's father tells us , " and we 've had more sandstorms			1
we 've never experienced weather this bad			0
" @entity198 : @entity11 's agriculture ministry estimates that 90 percent of the country 's lands now produce unprofitable food			1
@entity192 : " when there is a food shortage , " @entity190 warns , " people will turn to other methods to get what they need , and that includes violence			1
" ( @entity253 ) @entity254 @entity255 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm an island nation that 's located in the @entity259			2
i was settled by @entity261 , but i got my independence from the @entity263 in 1962			0

i 'm @entity266 ! and i 'm home to around 2.8 million people , including the fastest man in the world ! @entity271 @entity35 : it 's like he 's got lightning in his shoes			1
@entity266 sprinter @entity275 , the " fastest man in the world , " recently set two new records at the @entity278			1
@entity275 bolted 100 meters in 9.58 seconds , 200 meters in 19.19 seconds - i do n't think i drive that fast			0
and while he was in @entity281 , @entity280 found out that @entity275 's shoes are seeing success both on the track and in the bank			1
( @entity286 ) people on the street : @entity275 , @entity275			2

fans lined up for hours at this @entity291 flagship store to meet the fastest man in the world			1
@entity275 , fastest man in the world : i think it is all my hard work and dedication			1
i 'm really dedicated to being a champion			0
i want to be a legend			0
so , i have to work really hard if i want to be a champion			0
so , i 'm just doing that and that 's it			2
@entity305 : how about this for legendary : @entity281 dedicated an original piece of the infamous @entity308 to bolt to be displayed in his homeland , @entity266			0
@entity311 : it 's definitely it 's an honor			2
i got my face painted all over it			0
i 'm going to put it in front of my house if i can get it there			0
i 'm looking for that			0
it was an honor getting a piece of the wall			0
@entity305 : many are trying to grab a piece of the pie			0
there 's the @entity266 tourism board , and @entity291 's @entity266 collection is flying off the shelves			2
@entity275 's big success means big money for his sponsor @entity291			1
you have the @entity275 hoodie shirt , a whole @entity266 collection , including t - shirts , and the @entity275 shoes , which are sold out in almost every store			0
@entity339 , ceo , @entity291 : he 's not just an athlete , he 's just an amazing personality , which i think for the first time gives a great opportunity to promote an athlete beyond his sport			2
he 's about fun , he 's about the @entity266 lifestyle , and that 's something that we 're also trying to incorporate into our collections			2
@entity305 : @entity291 believes @entity275 's advertising value goes into the hundreds of millions			2
even @entity275 's dad says he 's never seen so many people sport @entity266 's colors outside @entity266			1
@entity356 , @entity275 's father : that surprises me			2
everybody wants to be @entity266 now			0
@entity305 : but @entity291 may want to watch out			0
head hunters are prowling their star athlete , even at this @entity291 event			0

we will make a million dollar contract			0
here 's my contacts for a @entity373 company			2
here 's my contacts , an advertising contract we would make			2
@entity305 : @entity275 seemed less than interested , but for a man who can mobilize the masses like this , other offers are sure to follow			2

before we go @entity35 : before we go , you might dream about showing up to your class reunion in a @entity400 or a @entity401			0
any exhotic set of wheels			0
this guy decided he only needed two wheels - old school			0
but his wheels still impressed all his former classmates , especially since he rode them 800 miles to get there ! @entity410 -- that is really his name -- he biked from @entity413 , @entity414 to @entity415 , @entity416 for his 50th college reunion just to prove to himself he was n't getting old			0
