-- @entity2 inquiries into the dealings of @entity6 gov. @entity5 's administration , sen. @entity7 and former @entity9 gov. @entity8 represent the highest profile push in federal public corruption cases since the scandal surrounding lobbyist @entity13 nearly a decade ago			1
the cases also present the department with a chance to prove it can do big and notoriously difficult public integrity cases after a series of embarrassments , including the prosecution of former sen. @entity21 , who beat back corruption charges , and its initially successful prosecution of late @entity25 sen. @entity24 , which was dismissed because of prosecutor misconduct			0
@entity6 @entity30 attorney @entity29 's preliminary inquiry into allegations of political strong - arm tactics by top @entity5 appointees so far has n't established proof of a federal crime , according to two people familiar with the matter			1
agents from the @entity41 's @entity6 field office are continuing to do " fact - finding " interviews before determining whether to formally open a full - blown investigation , those people said			1
a formal investigation can be launched if investigators find enough evidence to warrant additional investigative steps			2
so far , @entity29 's office has sought subpoenas from @entity5 's reelection campaign and the @entity51 , which the governor controls			1
potential " can of worms " for a time , federal authorities were reluctant to get involved in the leading @entity5 controversy , which erupted from a @entity57 - led state assembly investigation of suggestions top @entity5 appointees abused their authority by allegedly orchestrating traffic gridlock around the @entity61 in @entity62 last year to politically punish that town 's mayor for not endorsing their boss for reelection			1
@entity5 denies having any knowledge of the alleged scheme			1
some officials did n't readily see a federal crime and were wary of opening what one official called potentially " a can of worms			1
" even before e-mails were released by democratic state assembly members looking into the bridge scandal , @entity29 had received a referral from the inspector general from the @entity79 and @entity6 , which prompted prosecutors to start a preliminary inquiry			1
the @entity79 oversees bridges and tunnels linking @entity84 and @entity6 , and is led by appointed officials from both states			1
after the explosive series of e-mails were released , @entity29 decided to make his inquiry public			0
the ongoing review may yet conclude there is n't a federal crime to pursue , an official familiar with the probe said			1
in addition to the traffic mess involving access lane closures to the @entity61 last september , federal investigators are also examining whether the @entity5 administration conditioned @entity101 recovery aid for @entity102 on support from that city 's mayor for a redevelopment project backed by @entity5 and proposed by a firm with ties to the governor			1
@entity29 's spokeswoman @entity110 declined to comment and administration officials deny the assertion			2
with the highly partisan controversy swirling , @entity29 , a @entity57 political appointee , must show his office is handling the case impartially			2
making it even more complicated , @entity5 is @entity29 's immediate predecessor as @entity30 attorney			1
other cases @entity29 's office has dealt before with potentially controversial political cases			2
in 2012 as @entity7 ran for reelection , @entity29 's office pursued charges against donors to the senator 's campaigns			2
@entity7 called @entity29 to complain after a series of leaks appeared in the press that tied him to brothers @entity129 and @entity131 , who were accused of making illegal campaign donations to his campaign			0
people familiar with the matter said @entity29 reported the contacts to the deputy attorney general 's office in @entity138 under protocols that were strengthened following the scandal over the @entity143 administration 's controversial firings of @entity30 attorneys			1
the @entity2 declined to comment			2
@entity145 , a @entity146 spokeswoman , said : " after hearing from several reporters about leaks of information in the @entity153 case , senator @entity7 both personally and through his attorney expressed his concern about such leaks to the @entity30 attorney			0
he in no way expressed any opinions about how the case should be handled			0
his only concern was that his reputation not be unfairly besmirched by false , anonymous statements			0
senator @entity7 and his campaign , which was a victim of @entity153 's crime , cooperated fully with the @entity30 attorney 's investigation every step of the way and were glad that it was prosecuted to the full extent of the law			2
" federal prosecutors continue to look into @entity7 's involvement with another supporter in @entity175			2
the case ongoing for more than a year involves prosecutors from @entity178 and from justice headquarters in @entity138 looking into whether @entity7 improperly tried intervene in an ongoing fraud probe of a @entity175 doctor with close ties to the senator			2
@entity8 , the former @entity9 governor , is charged with his wife , @entity183 , with public corruption related to gifts the couple received from a friend who heads a nutritional supplements company			0
@entity8 and his wife say they 're innocent in a case that outside observers say could be difficult to prove to a jury			0
they pleaded not guilty on friday in @entity195 with trial set for july			0
a renewed focus the cases come amid a renewed focus on public corruption cases			0
attorney general @entity201 , who began his career in the @entity2 's public integrity section , has made a push to revamp the department 's public corruption efforts in the wake of the @entity24 debacle			1
@entity209 , a former public integrity prosecutor who helped prosecute @entity143 - era vice presidential aide @entity210 in a @entity211 leaks case , says " those cases , particularly the @entity24 case , leave a lasting mark			0
" given the often political nature of public corruption cases , partisan sniping is always in the background as prosecutors lead their probes			0
amid the swirl of public leaks by political opponents cases often look easier than they are , @entity209 said			0
" political corruption cases are notoriously hard cases to make			0
you have to prove corrupt intent , which is a difficult thing to do , " @entity209 said			0
in the allegations swirling around the @entity5 administration , based on public information released so far , @entity209 says that " it does not look like a criminal case at all			1
it looks like political shenanigans , but it does n't seem at first blush that there 's a federal crime there			1
there is a line eventually that can be crossed between pure political favors and extortion			0
but there 's a large gray area in between			0

federal probe of @entity5 administration has n't found any evidence of a crime so far , sources say
@entity41 's @entity6 field office continues " fact - finding " interviews
@entity6 bridge scandal and questions about @entity101 aid have prompted inquiries
