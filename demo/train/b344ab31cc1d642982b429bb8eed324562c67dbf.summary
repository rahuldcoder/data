a jury will be allowed to consider a confession by a suspect with a low iq who is accused of killing a 6 - year - old boy more than three decades ago , a judge ruled monday			1
in may 2012 , @entity8 told police that he choked @entity10 to death in @entity12 in 1979 , police say			1
@entity8 's attorney , @entity13 , argued that his client falsely confessed and the statements were not reliable because @entity8 had been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an " iq in the borderline - to - mild mental retardation range			1
" the statements in question were made during three events across two days in may 2012 : a 7Â½ - hour interrogation , a 20 - minute videotape of the statement following the interrogation , and a statement made at the district attorney 's office the next morning , @entity13 said			0
" i think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished , mr. @entity8 believed he had killed @entity10			1
but that does n't mean he actually did and that 's the whole point of this case , " @entity13 told @entity31 affiliate @entity32			0
but judge @entity36 ruled monday that the confession was admissible , writing that @entity8 's waiver of @entity40 rights was " knowing and intelligent , " according to court documents			1
@entity36 cited reports of two forensic psychology experts who met with @entity8 and determined he was " in fact capable of knowingly waiving his rights , " the decision said			2
the two experts agreed that " although the defendant has a very low iq , that alone does not necessarily prevent a person from understanding @entity40 warnings and making a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights , " court documents said			2
