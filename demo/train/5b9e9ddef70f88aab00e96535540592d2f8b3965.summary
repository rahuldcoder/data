prime minister @entity1 's trip to @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 underscores that the @entity5 remains the cornerstone of @entity9 's @entity8 diplomacy			1
before cutting his trip short to deal with the kidnapping of @entity9 nationals in @entity13 , @entity1 commented , " open seas are public assets and @entity9 will do utmost to protect them by cooperating with @entity5			1
@entity19 's economic rise is definitely a plus for @entity9 but it is important for @entity19 to act responsibly as part of international society			1
" coming amid an escalating territorial dispute with @entity19 over the @entity27 / @entity27 islands , it appears that @entity1 's diplomacy aims to strengthen @entity9 's hand vis - a - vis @entity19			1
ironically , during his last visit to the region back when he was previously premier in 2007 , @entity1 promoted an @entity32			0
at that time the reaction to this values - based initiative aimed at containing @entity19 was lukewarm			2
now @entity19 's muscle flexing in the region has everyone worried			2
@entity40 's growing assertiveness in territorial disputes has raised tensions and left @entity19 diplomatically isolated			1
while everyone is concerned about @entity1 's revisionist views concerning @entity9 's wartime history , especially his caviling about the " comfort women , " there is widespread appreciation in the region for @entity9 's post-wwii contributions to peace and development			1
@entity5 has no concerns that @entity9 represents a threat to regional stability , but the same can not be said for @entity19			2
@entity1 is on a mission to reinvigorate the @entity9 economy , win control of the upper house of the @entity61 ) in summer elections and push through constitutional revision to remove constraints on @entity9 's military			1
hounded from office in 2007 because of his poor political skills and failures to address voters ' economic anxieties , @entity1 seeks redemption and has hit the ground running			2
he has publicly pressured the @entity73 to adopt unlimited monetary easing and a 2 % inflation target , unveiled a $ 117 billion fiscal stimulus package , sent his finance and foreign ministers on key diplomatic missions to @entity80 and @entity81 , and dispatched an envoy to @entity83 to reach out to new president @entity84			0
this flurry of diplomatic activity is driven by economic and security concerns			0
@entity9 companies are investing heavily in the growth prospects of @entity80			0
@entity9 is a leading economic partner overall and @entity1 seeks to reassure its partners , and voters at home , that @entity9 will remain a major global player			1
when the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) took over in 2009 , pm @entity95 promoted warmer ties with @entity40 , but that strategy has not exactly worked out			0
@entity19 maritime and aerial probing in the disputed territory in the @entity102 has escalated security concerns and also damaged economic relations			0
it has been assumed that economic relations would continue to prosper despite chilly political relations , but that calculus no longer holds			0
@entity9 business has played a key role in @entity19 's rapid rise , and will continue to do so , but on a lesser scale as the mood has soured dramatically			1
@entity5 's gdp is less than a third the size of @entity19 , but the region is resource - rich , has a lot of untapped growth potential and represents a good hedge against political risk in @entity19			2
much has been made of the @entity123 strategic pivot to @entity80 involving the reallocation of @entity126 security assets to a region where @entity128 sees the greatest economic opportunities and security risks			0
while the @entity126 was distracted by wars in @entity133 and @entity134 , there was a perception of policy drift towards the @entity137 , leaving @entity19 to expand its influence			0
the @entity139 talks about cooperation with @entity40 on key issues , but seems to have settled into a " contain and isolate " mode			0
he has called for a $ 1 billion ( 2.6 % ) increase in defense spending and will build six new @entity146 patrol vessels			0
he also included significant security - related logistical support in his fiscal stimulus package , is shifting security assets to @entity150 in southwestern @entity9 and is establishing a @entity146 patrol group that will focus on monitoring @entity19 probing in the disputed territory			1
@entity1 also seeks to modify defense guidelines to facilitate expanded security cooperation with the @entity126 part two of the @entity1 pivot is expected following the @entity158 elections			0
if the @entity160 succeeds in winning it will hold the reins in both houses of the @entity61 , creating an opportunity for him to push through his longstanding agenda of removing constitutional constraints on the military			0
while this will prove controversial at home , and in a region where memories of @entity9 's wartime excesses still resonate , @entity128 welcomes the prospect of enhanced burden sharing			1
@entity19 's decade of smile diplomacy -- aimed at reassuring the region that a rising @entity19 is not a threat -- has imploded and its feistiness has only increased its diplomatic isolation			2
equally , @entity9 's rightward political shift and the @entity1 pivot could backfire , alienating the region while stoking tensions			1
the current test of wills and ratcheting up the saber rattling is a dangerous dead - end			0
quiet diplomacy and a cooling off period leading @entity40 and @entity187 to hand each other a ladder to climb down might prove more helpful in averting some grave miscalculation over the divisive islets			2
renunciation of military solutions after all , is a cornerstone of @entity9 's @entity196 success and high esteem in the region .			1
