-- @entity1 knew something was wrong when she saw a bulging cloud of black dust darken the sky			1
drought - like conditions dried this @entity8 bed last year near @entity9 , @entity10			2
she then heard an eerie , train - like whistle as fierce winds rattled her front door and windows			0
when she looked outside , hordes of grasshoppers and crows swarmed over her father 's barren farm			0
after the storm broke , her father walked outside and muttered curses as he scanned the horizon for rain clouds			0
" i can remember my dad just watching the sky so closely , " @entity1 says			1
" a sprinkle would excite him so much			0
" that 's how @entity1 , now 83 , describes growing up on an @entity31 farm during the @entity33 storms in the 1930s			1
for much of that decade , " black blizzards " -- formed by a prolonged drought and poor farming techniques -- ravaged much of the nation			2
now a new generation of @entity40 is again anxiously looking to the sky			2
drought has returned to the @entity40 , and some warn that more tough days are ahead			1
the value of water is starting to become apparent in @entity40			1
over the past three years a drought has affected large swaths of the country , and conflicts over water usage may become commonplace in the future , climatologists say			1
" our focus is oil , but the critical need for water is going to make water the most significant natural resource that we 're going to have to worry about in the future , " says @entity53 , executive director of the @entity54 at @entity55 in @entity56			2
at least 36 states expect to face water shortages within the next five years , according to a report from the @entity68			1
according to the @entity70 , several regions in particular have been hit hard : the @entity71 , @entity72 and the @entity73			0
@entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 have suffered the worst droughts this year , the agency said			0
yet most people do n't need scientists to tell them there 's a water shortage			2
plenty of cities have implemented water bans while state squabbles over water usage are common in some regions			2
what may surprise people , though , are the causes for the recent drought			2
it 's not global warming , some climatologists say			0
the droughts are caused by rapid population growth and unwise agricultural choices			1
@entity99 , a professor of atmospheric science at the @entity101 in @entity102 , says the last three years have been drier than usual in many parts of the @entity40 , but overall there 's been no shortage of rainfall			1
he says the @entity40 mainland experienced worse droughts in the 12th and 16th centuries			2
" the demand for water has gone up , " @entity110 says			0
" the demand has skyrocketed in places like @entity10 and @entity114 because they 've tried to grow crops in deserts			0
" even drought conditions in the @entity71 ca n't be blamed on a shortage of rainfall , @entity110 says			0
the region 's water delivery systems ca n't keep pace with the growth , he says			2
" the rain is still falling , but you 're out of water because the storage facilities are not big enough , " @entity110 says			0
there 's also a public perception that ordinary people are wasting more water , but that 's not true , says @entity134 , a climatologist with the @entity70			0
" per capita use of water is down because we 're learning to be more efficient , " @entity134 says			0
water shortages do n't have to remain a fact of modern life , drought experts say			1
many offer the same solutions : build better water delivery systems to accommodate population growth , develop more efficient uses of irrigation , and shift agriculture from the @entity73 to the @entity149 where it 's easier and cheaper to water crops			1
@entity134 believes a change in attitude is even more vital than changing habits			0
" we take water for granted , " he says			0
" we think it 's a cheap commodity that 's always going to be there			0
" @entity1 , the @entity33 survivor , does n't appear to need that lesson			1
she remembers how precious water was in the 1930s when people fetched water in buckets			1
and when the rains finally ended the @entity33 , she vividly remembers her joyous father driving his family out into his fields just to watch the water settle into the soil			1
@entity1 , who now lives in @entity172 , @entity173 , gets upset when she sees people throw away bottled water or use too much water to wash their cars			1
" we do n't value water and we 're going to regret it , " @entity1 says			1
we 're as dumb as we can be and we do n't learn			0

over the past three years a drought has affected large swaths of the @entity40
report : at least 36 states expect to face water shortages within the next five years
experts say main causes are rapid population growth and unwise farming practices
