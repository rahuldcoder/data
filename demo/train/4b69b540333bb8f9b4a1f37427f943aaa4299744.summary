-- @entity4 settlements have taken a " heavy toll " on the rights and sovereignty of @entity8 , a @entity2 report said thursday			1
the @entity10 report ticked off a range of rights it says have been consistently violated in the @entity14 and @entity15 during what it calls " creeping annexation " by @entity4			1
@entity19 : @entity4 's man of the ' future ' they include " self - determination , non-discrimination , freedom of movement , equality , due process , fair trial , not to be arbitrarily detained , liberty and security of person , freedom of expression , freedom to access places of worship , education , water , housing , adequate standard of living , property , access to natural resources			2
" " the settlements are established for the exclusive benefit of @entity4 jews ; settlements are being maintained and developed through a system of total segregation between the settlers and the rest of the population , " the report said			1
" this system of segregation is supported and facilitated by a strict military and law enforcement control to the detriment of the rights of the @entity8 population			0
" @entity4 defies international criticism of settlement plans palestinians welcomed the report , which calls for the settlement activity to stop and settlers to depart			1
@entity4 , which has long considered the @entity10 as " systematically one - sided and biased " toward the jewish state , said the report will hurt peace efforts			1
@entity4 did not cooperate with the @entity2 three - person mission , whose members are from @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			0
the @entity2 report was issued after @entity4 did not show up at a @entity2 review of its human rights record			2
" the only way to resolve all pending issues between @entity4 and the @entity8 , including the settlements issue , is through direct negotiations without preconditions , " said @entity75 , @entity4 's @entity77 spokesman			2
" counterproductive measures , such as the report before us , will only hamper efforts to find a sustainable solution to the @entity4 - @entity8 conflict			1
" read more : @entity4 says it will build settlements in @entity15 there are about 250 settlements in the @entity14 and @entity15 , the report said , all started since @entity4 seized the lands after the @entity94 in 1967			1
there are about 320,000 people in the @entity14 and 200,000 in @entity15			1
after the war , @entity4 soon annexed @entity15			2
it established a unified @entity15 as its capital and has established settlements in the @entity14 , the @entity8 land , over the decades , but has not annexed any of that territory			1
the country has cited the need for a presence in the @entity14 for security , but @entity106 settlers -- some for religious reasons and others seeking affordable dwellings -- have made their homes in the land			2
that consistently growing presence in @entity15 and the @entity14 has caused great tension between @entity4 and the @entity114 world , including the @entity8			1
@entity115 : inside @entity4 's planned settlement the inability of @entity4 and the @entity8 to reach a political agreement over the @entity14 and @entity15 has arguably been one of the major obstacles to peace in the region			1
the report cited evidence of " dispossession , evictions , demolitions and displacement , " particularly widespread in @entity15			2
it cited the existence of @entity106 settler violence			0
it said that harassment of @entity8 is " institutionalized " and that women alone in their homes , bedouins and other " vulnerable groups are easy targets for settler violence			0
" " the identities of settlers who are responsible for violence and intimidation are known to the @entity4 authorities , yet these acts continue with impunity , " the report said			1
" the motivation behind this violence and the intimidation against the @entity8 as well as their properties is to drive the local populations away from their lands and allow the settlements to expand			2
" the fact - finding mission singled out a " high number of children " seized by authorities " for minor offenses			0
" " they are invariably mistreated , denied due process and fair trial , " the report said			0
in violation of international law , they are " transferred to detention centers in @entity4			0
" @entity169 : new @entity4 settlements a ' setback ' for peace it also said that @entity4 is failing to protect their right of access to education			0
" children suffer harassment , violence and encounter significant obstacles in attending educational institutions , which limits their right to access education , " the report said			0
it also said @entity4 must comply with the @entity186 , which states that occupying powers should n't transfer parts of its civilian population into territory it occupies			0
it calls for stopping all settlement activity and says @entity4 " must immediately initiate a process of withdrawal of all settlers			0
" @entity195 , a member of the executive committee of the @entity197 , called the report " courageous			0
" she hails it for labeling all settlement activities as illegal and noting that serious settler violence is leading to " ethnic cleansing			0
" " instead of boycotting the @entity10 , @entity4 should act in compliance with this report			1
otherwise , it will continue to isolate itself outside the law and it will continue to delegitimize its behavior in all aspects of the occupation , " she said .			0

@entity4 says it thinks the @entity10 is biased
a @entity8 politician *praises* the report
there are more than *500,000* people living in @entity15 and the @entity14
