-- @entity3 striker @entity2 " needs education " after continuing to protest his innocence despite being punished for racial abuse , according to a former @entity7 player			1
@entity2 was banned for eight games and fined $ 63,000 on tuesday , pending an appeal , for comments made to @entity12 's @entity11 during a match in october			1
his club issued a lengthy statement on his behalf after the ruling , as did his teammates before wednesday 's match against @entity19 , and his lawyer held a press conference in @entity22			1
manager @entity23 backed the 24 - year - old on @entity25 , and also wore a t - shirt depicting the @entity22 international as he continued the defense in his pre-game interview			1
" @entity37 will defend their players , they are their assets -- they will defend their players to the hilt , " said @entity30 , a former @entity31 under - 21 international who played for @entity33 and @entity34 but now works with the @entity36 campaign			1
footballers are tv stars , and should act like it " the most important thing now , after the punishment , is education			2
he has highlighted when talking about the cultural differences that he needs some education , he needs to be able to understand that when you come to another country you have to respect the laws and the rules			2
" when i go abroad and my children come with me , you educate them on what is the norm in that environment			2
it 's folly to say that he did n't know that -- he 's an international footballer , he played at the @entity60 in @entity61			0
you ca n't tell me that he did n't understand what was required in this country			0
" @entity2 reportedly called @entity66 - born @entity67 international @entity11 " negrito " -- a @entity69 term meaning " black " which can be endearing when used with friends , but otherwise is considered offensive			1
@entity73 journalist @entity72 said @entity2 , who played for @entity75 club @entity74 from 2007 to the start of this year , had no excuse for pleading ignorance about the potential offense such a word could have in the @entity73			1
" i find this defense breathtakingly implausible from @entity2			2
he 's lived in @entity82 for four years -- the idea that he did n't know that this particular terminology would be deeply offensive to someone like @entity11 is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion , " @entity72 told @entity0			1
" i do n't think it 's an adequate defense anywhere in a multicultural society , in a cosmopolitan environment like football , to say that ' this sort of racist terminology is okay where i come from , so you have to put up with it			2
' " you have to obey the law and conventions of the place you are living in			0
" @entity31 soccer captain @entity100 charged with racism @entity103 president @entity102 caused anger when he told @entity0 last month that there is no problem with on - pitch racism in football , but @entity30 insists that is not the case			1
" i think there is an issue , this proves there is an issue , " the 43 - year - old told @entity0			2
" there are more players that have suffered from racist abuse but never really spoken out about it			1
" i myself suffered from it when i was playing			0
but you find it 's difficult to speak out about it , because the highlight is then put on the victim			0
" one question i was always asked was , ' are you really sure ? ' am i really sure that someone is racially abusing me ? i think i am			0
what is black and white becomes gray , because you get questioned			0
" throughout this situation the most important thing is , ' what was said ? was it said ? ' if it was then it is something we have to deal with -- investigate , and punish if punishment is necessary			0
" @entity3 's @entity2 fined , suspended over racist remarks @entity72 , a former table tennis international who now writes for @entity145 , said racism in @entity7 football is not as much of a problem as it once was			1
" in the 1970s and ' 80s , football was a place where far - right political groups would stalk the terraces for people to sign up for their hateful ideology , " he said			0
" black players were booed , monkey chants were issued towards them , banana skins were thrown on the pitch			0
it 's a lot better now than it was then , no question about that			0
" i 'm rather encouraged by the fact that a lot of top players have come out and instead of condoning and being apologetic for what ( @entity165 captain ) @entity100 and @entity2 are alleged to have said , they 've come out with quite a zero - tolerance approach			1
" @entity31 skipper @entity100 is facing criminal charges over alleged racial abuse of @entity172 player @entity171 , with a possible maximum fine of Â £ 2,500			2
he could face further action from the @entity175 depending on the outcome of his february 1 court case			0
@entity2 's punishment , the first of its kind in @entity31 , paled in comparison to several previous high - profile @entity175 disciplinary rulings			1
former @entity31 captain @entity184 was banned eight months in 2004 for missing a drugs test , @entity183 was sidelined for the same period in 1995 for karate kicking a fan , and in 1998 @entity188 was suspended 11 matches for pushing a referee			0
" there 's not much of a precedent , it 's a bit like plucking a number out of the air , " @entity72 said			2
" but even if this is n't as severe as those cases , it is nevertheless a significant deterrent			0
@entity3 are going to miss @entity2 , no doubt about that			1
" it 's also a partisan case			0
it 's not just the clubs that are divided on this moral issue -- @entity165 backing @entity100 , and @entity3 with @entity2 -- it 's also the fans of both clubs			1
there is an issue for football , the partisanship trumps the bigger moral questions that are the most important ones			0

@entity3 officials and players rally around @entity2 after his punishment for racist abuse
but an *anti-racism* campaigner says the club should be trying to educate the player instead
@entity30 , also a former player , says @entity2 needs to learn cultural understanding
journalist @entity72 tells @entity0 that @entity22 had no excuse for pleading ignorance
