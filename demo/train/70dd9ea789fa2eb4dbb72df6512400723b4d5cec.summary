@entity0 , @entity1 -- " mr. ambassador , as time goes on we know that the odds of my son and the other relatives on the plane having survived becomes smaller and smaller , " said a grey - haired man named @entity12			1
as he addressed the @entity14 diplomat seated at a table just a few feet away in the packed @entity0 hotel conference room , @entity12 began sobbing uncontrollably into a microphone			1
it had been more than 45 days since his son disappeared aboard missing @entity20			0
" to know that somebody is alive , you need to see them			0
to know that somebody is dead , you need to see the body			0
that 's all i ask of you , " @entity12 concluded , weeping			2
members of the audience sobbed quietly in their seats			0
visibly uncomfortable , the representative from @entity14 's embassy in @entity0 , could do little more than repeat his government 's talking points			1
" there 's a team coming to answer your questions			2
let them come , " he pleaded			0
but the words from deputy chief of mission @entity42 only angered the relatives			2
they erupted into fist - waving chants : " live up to commitments ! no more delays ! no more lies ! " each day seems to bring another disappointment to the hundreds of @entity1 relatives waiting for news about missing loved ones			1
153 @entity1 nationals flew aboard the ill - fated flight			1
for more than a month , @entity54 has housed hundreds of their relatives in a number of @entity0 hotels			1
from their improvised headquarters in @entity0 's @entity60 , the families have set up committees , published press releases , printed t - shirts and hats with the slogan " pray for @entity70 , " while also coordinating information with the next of kin of passengers from other countries			1
this agonizing limbo has been punctuated by highly emotional and contentious daily briefings held with @entity14 officials in a windowless conference room in the @entity60			1
last week , relatives stormed out of the hall en masse after technical glitches left a panel of @entity14 technical experts mute on a giant screen			1
the long - awaited video conference with @entity82 was a complete failure			0
" you 're all bloody liars , and you 're lying to us again now ! " one representative yelled , as relatives marched out of the room			2
a committee representing passengers ' families in @entity0 has continued pressing its case , demanding answers to highly technical questions that were translated and submitted in writing to the @entity14 government			1
to better understand the final moments before @entity20 was believed to have crashed into the @entity98 , they wanted the audio recording of the crew 's last radio communications with air traffic controllers , an explanation of how many emergency locator transmitters [ @entity106 's ] the plane was carrying and whether or not the @entity106 's activated as intended at the moment the aircraft hit the ocean			2
" you need to do it yourself , " explained a young @entity1 physicist on the families ' technical committee , who had helped draw up the questions			1
the man asked not to be identified , because he was keeping his father 's disappearance a secret for fear of upsetting his elderly grandmother			2
for several days after the failed video conference , @entity14 diplomats did not appear at daily briefings			1
instead a representative of @entity14 airlines addressed increasingly hostile family members			1
last friday , he pledged that a high - level team of technical experts would come to @entity0 the following monday to brief the family members			1
but that monday , @entity14 informed family members there had been a last - minute change of plan			1
" the authorities in @entity14 would like to move forward in the endeavor to address the missing flight @entity70 , " said @entity42 , the @entity14 deputy chief of mission			1
" while keeping in mind that the family have many questions regarding technical issues , the authorities over the weekend put the view that these important questions should be taken up a little later at an appropriate time and place			0
" the message was not well received			0
for nearly three hours , @entity1 relatives took turns yelling , begging and cursing at the @entity14			1
" are you hiding things from us ? are there things you are not willing to tell us ? " said @entity152 , a spokesman for the families whose wife was a passenger			2
in these highly emotional confrontations , it is clear that many of the @entity1 next of kin believe their missing loved ones are still alive			2
" we have not given up hope			0
we dare to believe , " said mr. @entity12 during his tearful speech on monday			0
however , hope has become a dangerous emotion , according to a psychologist who has helped treat some of the next of kin			0
" that 's a dangerous thing when you artificially manifest hope which in the end can not be sustained			0
you are setting them up for a fall , " said @entity174 , a counselling psychologist who also treated victims of @entity176 , which crashed in @entity177 in 2013 killing at least three people			0
but @entity174 said @entity14 authorities bore some responsibility for the crisis			2
" so many of the moves that they have taken are just so wrong , " @entity174 said			0
@entity14 officials sent to brief @entity1 families are armed with little to no information on the search for the plane			1
meanwhile , in the eyes of many passengers ' relatives , contradictory statements from @entity82 have shaken the credibility of @entity14 officials charged with leading the investigation			1
lack of information has led many to suspect a cover - up , an accusation @entity14 authorities have repeatedly denied			1
while repeatedly challenging the @entity14 government , the passengers ' families face clear limits that appear to have been set by the @entity1 authorities			1
on friday , the family committee announced plans to hold a prayer ceremony for missing spouses in a park near the @entity60			0
instead , the service was held in the same conference room			0
dozens of men and women sat cross-legged on the floor , weeping in front of a banner that said : " honey , it 's not home without you			0
" after the ceremony , the spouses -- many dressed in " @entity70 " t - shirts and baseball hats , marched out of the hotel to the park			0
they were closely followed by uniformed and plain - clothed @entity1 police			2
after a short speech in front of the park gates , they drifted back to their hotel			0
" it 's just like big cage , " said @entity239 , when asked about the hotel			0
the 26 year old has become one of the main international spokespeople for the committee of family members			0
" it is full of bad emotion ... we feel sad and angry and exhausted , " @entity239 added .			0
