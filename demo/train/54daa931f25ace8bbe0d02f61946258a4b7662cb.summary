-- early next year , bidders are expected to shell out millions for cars that stood around in @entity4 's yard for decades			1
the @entity6 truck manufacturing mogul had big dreams for them			1
he wanted to found a museum and build a miniature railroad loop for visitors to ride around and view them , a @entity10 auction house said			1
but the plans evaporated when his business went bust in the 1970s			2
he sold off nearly half of his collection , but 60 of his classic @entity24 luxury and sports cars -- many built in the first half of the 20th century -- remained and collected rust , dust and weeds for about 50 years			1
until car experts from auction house @entity29 recently came upon them in a small town in western @entity6 , not far from @entity33			1
$ 14.9 million now , buyers will probably write checks for hundreds of thousands for just one of the sagging exquisite carriages			1
@entity29 will put them under the hammer in february and expects the crown jewel in the collection , a 1961 @entity41 , to fetch 9.5 million to 12 million euros ( $ 11 million to $ 14.9 million )			1
the convertible was one of only 37 of its kind made , and it is in comparatively great condition , as it slumbered behind the doors of a snug garage , @entity42 said			0
it was piled high with copies of a vintage magazine , @entity53 -- @entity54 -- when @entity29 's car expert @entity55 found it			2
the @entity41 's roommate in the garage was a 1956 @entity58 that auctioneers think will go for 800,000 to 1.2 million euros ( about $ 990,000 to nearly $ 1.5 million )			1
scrapyard most of the rest of the other sleeping beauties lay comatose under roofs of corrugated steel held up by posts ; with no walls to protect them , they were exposed to the elements			0
@entity55 heard about the car yard over the phone and went to check it out			0
at first glance , the cars looked like the rest of the junk in the yard -- old washing machines , metal scrap , barrels			2
but gems gradually sparkled through			0
" nature had taken a hold over the years			0
@entity82 had invaded a car and entirely covered its ( steering ) wheel , while weeds had taken root in a passenger compartment as easily as in a greenhouse , " @entity55 said			0
" in places , the sheets of corrugated iron were resting directly on the cars			0
" @entity4 died about 10 years ago , said @entity29 spokeswoman @entity94			2
@entity4 's son inherited the estate , but when he recently died , his heirs contacted the auction house to sell the unique collection , she added			1
legends most of the cars will require a deep kiss of restoration to reawaken the former glory of their exclusive brands , some of which are no longer manufactured			0
@entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity117 - @entity116 stood motionless in the estate that @entity4 bought to store them			2
the largest contingency of the collected cars hit the streets between 1955 and 1965 , @entity42 said in a statement			0
some have stories to go along with them			0
the 1961 @entity41 was once owned by @entity6 silver screen demigod @entity126 , @entity42 said , and he was photographed sitting in it next to @entity129 in 1964 , and with @entity130			1
legend also slumbers in the peach - colored rust covering a @entity133 , a @entity6 classic brand that died out some 50 years ago			2
@entity42 says this one was driven by former @entity137 @entity136			0

60 luxury cars sat on the grounds of a @entity6 mogul 's estate for decades
@entity4 wanted to build a museum for the cars , but his business *declined*
a 1961 @entity41 is expected to fetch up to $ 14.9 million at auction in february
the auctioneer says it once belonged to actor @entity126 and that @entity129 rode in it
