the thronging mass of people in front of me , which seconds before had been surging forward to see a tar - lined barrel being set aflame , suddenly parts			2
charging towards me , like a blazing bull , is a young man with a raging inferno on his shoulders			0
i duck and weave , looking for an opening in the crowd to escape through , but none exists			0
abruptly , though , the flaming figure performs a pirouette and changes direction			2
i join the chase as the reassembled masses forget their fear and race after the barrel runner , with fire - lust burning in their eyes			1
i 'm in @entity25 , a normally sleepy in the @entity27 region of southwestern @entity28			1
across the country in november , most communities celebrate bonfire night -- a fiery commemoration of a foiled attempt to blow up @entity35 's @entity34 in 1605			2
here they do it by charging up and down the streets with flaming tar barrels held aloft			1
it 's the maddest thing i 've ever witnessed			2
gunpowder plot the health - and - safety defying tradition is at least several centuries old			1
although its exact origins have gone up in smoke , it 's thought they 're linked to the " gunpowder plot " of 1605			2
@entity47 , who 's been involved in the event for 30 years , has been on the 80 - strong organizing committee for the past 22 years and is now life president , explains that many places in southwestern @entity28 once had burning - barrel rolling festivals			1
" but one year a long , long time ago , some bright spark in @entity25 obviously decided that things would be a lot more exciting if you picked the barrel up , " says @entity47			1
" and then our unique tradition was born			2
" interpreted through the eyes of an expert , the festival is a lot more controlled than it appears at first glance			2
for starters , people ca n't just rock up , grab a burning barrel and go for a jog through the crowd			1
" the runners are extremely experienced , " @entity47 explains			0
" they come up through the ranks , starting with the kids ' barrels when they 're eight years old , and then progressing to the intermediate barrels			2
and then -- if they 're big enough and ugly enough -- they move up to the men 's barrels			1
" for @entity47 , it 's about the perpetuation of a proud tradition			1
" many of these guys come from families that have a connection with the event going back generations , " he says			0
" the fathers , grandfathers and great grandfathers of these lads carried barrels			1
" earlier in the evening i 'd witnessed the initiation of a new generation of barrel boys and girls			0
the barrel is slightly smaller for the kids ' event , but the principle is exactly the same : get the flaming thing up on your shoulders and run like mad , without dropping it , until someone else demands it			1
dancing with fire there 's no competitive element -- the challenge is to keep hold of the barrel for as long as possible , and to keep the flames bellowing			2
this explains the pirouettes , which get extra oxygen into the barrel			0
in total , 17 barrels are daubed with tar throughout the year , then set ablaze during the evening of november 5 , starting with the kids , then women and intermediates -- and finally the men			0
traditionally , each barrel is sponsored by a pub. although only four of the town 's original pubs remain , the memory of those that have shut is kept alive in the name of the barrels			1
by the time the men get going , @entity25 's streets are heaving with spectators who flock to the town			1
it 's estimated about 15,000 people come to see the event when it 's on a school night , and up to 20,000 gather when november 5 falls on a weekend			0
inevitably , every year there are complaints from people who feel the event is unsafe			0
@entity47 's message to them is simple : " the atmosphere is lighthearted , but the barrels do get run through the streets			1
if you do n't like it , please stand back			0
" and do n't touch or interfere with the barrels -- the boys really do n't like that			0
" visitors have to remember that they 're getting a free show			0
we do n't make anything out of this -- the collections that take place on the night just about cover costs			0
" every year getting insurance is a problem			0
of course there are injuries , but more of these are caused by factors other than the barrels -- like people boozing too much and falling over			0
" these days the runners are n't allowed to drink until they 've finished			0
but that does n't stop the crowd taking up the slack on the cider - swilling front , and the later the night gets , the more boisterous the atmosphere becomes			0
if the detractors think the event is crazy now , it 's good they were n't here a few years ago , before health and safety became such a big issue			2
" it was proper mayhem when i was young , " reminisces @entity47 , fondly			0
" people used to get cidered - up and there was plenty of fighting over the barrels			0
things used to get sorted out on november 5th			0
" @entity25 's @entity196 takes place on november 5			1
most of the barrels are lit outside the town 's four pubs : the @entity202 , @entity203 , the @entity35 and the @entity204			1
the first barrel runs start at 4 p.m. more at @entity206 @entity207 @entity25 is n't the only @entity209 town to turn fiery celebrations into unusual spectacles			1
the largest november 5 event in the world takes place in the @entity215 , in the southern @entity28 region of @entity217			1
the whole town burns brightly every year as up to 80,000 people come to watch six " bonfire societies " parade through the streets , dressed as smugglers , with burning crosses and ( sometimes controversial ) effigies , before lighting various infernos and letting off fireworks			1
burning tar barrels are also featured here , but they 're rolled , not carried			1
the event commemorates both the discovery of the 1605 gunpowder plot and the burning at the stake of 17 local @entity235 " martyrs			0
" up @entity236 before the 1880s , there was a great winter tradition of tar barreling in @entity242 's @entity241 , which saw local men dragging burning barrels through the town of @entity246 on sledges , getting up to high jinx en route			1
when this was banned , they started celebrating @entity236 , a fire festival that takes place on the last tuesday in january			0
this event features a torch - lit parade by people dressed as @entity258 and culminates with the dramatic burning of a @entity261 - style galley ship .			2
