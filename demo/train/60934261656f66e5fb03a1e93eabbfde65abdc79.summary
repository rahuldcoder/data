@entity2 's global rule - makers explained in a statement : " rule 14 - 1b , which was proposed on november 28 2012 , has now been given final approval by the @entity10 and the @entity11 following an extensive review by both organizations			1
" in adopting @entity42 , the @entity10 and the @entity11 have concluded that freely swinging the entire club is integral to maintaining the traditions of the game and preserving golf as an enjoyable game of skill and challenge			1
" the essence of the traditional method of golf stroke involves the player swinging the club with both the club and the gripping hands being held away from the body			2
" the concept of intentionally immobilizing one end of the golf club against the body ... is a substantial departure from that traditional understanding of the golf swing			1
" before introducing the ban , the @entity10 and the @entity11 first wanted a three - month period for comments to be made amid strong opposition from the @entity8 @entity16 and the @entity17			1

" the @entity93 , the @entity94 and the @entity95 have all supported the new regulation			0
world no. 1 @entity97 had also backed the ban , with the 14 - time major winner calling for the ruling to be implemented " as soon as possible			0
" the use of " belly " or " long - handled " putters fixed to the body has sparked debate in golf for the last two seasons			0
the sport 's governing bodies accepted that their decision wo n't please every player who takes to the green using such a club			1
" the anchored method of stroke has been a subject of controversy within the golf community for quite some time , " the joint statement said			0

" meanwhile , @entity129 's @entity128 captain @entity127 announced tuesday that he will have three wildcard selections for next year 's match against the @entity8 at @entity132 , @entity133			2
