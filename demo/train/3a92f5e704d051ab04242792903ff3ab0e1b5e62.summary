-- picture it : a four - day competition , with two to four workouts a day that consist of running , swimming , muscle - ups , 345 - pound squat cleans , handstand push - ups , rope climbs , double unders , handstand walks , 245 - pound overhead squats and more , against 43 of the most in - shape competitors you know , all with the title of @entity17 on @entity18 on the line			1
now imagine doing it four years in a row â € ” and winning every time			2
that 's what @entity24 did as he secured his fourth consecutive title as the fittest man on @entity18 at the @entity28 this past july			1
@entity1 : 5 beginner - friendly @entity28 workouts @entity24 , who has been said to do up to eight workouts a day , had the pressure of 200,000 live spectators as well as the world watching on his shoulders ( on top of 310 - plus actual pounds ) as he made his way through the grueling games			1
we caught up with the four - time @entity28 champion to learn what it means to be the @entity27 on @entity18 , his training and supplement regimen , and where he went for his celebratory burger post-games			1
can you put into words what it means to be the @entity27 on @entity18 for the fourth year in a row ? it feels good			1
it 's what i train for all year -- it 's the ultimate goal			2
the title 's just the title			1
winning the @entity28 is what i 'm most happy about			1
fittest man on @entity18 is cool , but @entity59 champion is what i most like			1
@entity1 : what hiit is and why it works crossfitters say @entity28 is a great sport for anyone			1
why is that ? do you think all people should try it ? maybe not even as a sport , but as a fitness program , it works			2
pick things up and put them down ; run ; carry stuff			2
it 's what our bodies were made to do -- not sit on a machine and do single joint movements			1
those are good things if that 's what you want to do -- it 's better than sitting and doing nothing			2
people get too caught up sometimes in thinking the traditional @entity28 circuit is [ all there is to it ]			1
but @entity28 is lifting heavy weights , being strong ... and it 's also running , it 's swimming , it 's rowing , it 's biking			1
it 's getting outside the gym			0
i think we did a lot of outside - the - gym @entity28 this year , and that was a little different than years past			1
picking up heavy objects and running with them , pushing the sled			1
a lot of us get caught up in just " gym @entity28			1
" probably because it 's fun			0
i like it , too			0
@entity1 : 5 @entity28 workouts that will kick your butt in terms of injuries , do you think a @entity111 is his or her own worst enemy ? what do you need to look out for so that you do n't get hurt ? yeah , i think people start out too quickly and say things like , " @entity24 does several workouts a day so i can do several workouts a day , too			1
" no , you need to ease into it and find a good coach			0
plenty of people have started @entity28 without a coach and not got hurt , but the best - case scenario is doing it with a good coach and learning the right movements			1
and also , i hate to say it , but people sometimes think they 're injured when they 're really just sore			0
you have to be smart about the workouts , but realize you 're going to be a little sore the first few times you do @entity28			1
for me , doing bodybuilding - type workouts using single - joint movements led to more injuries and more flair ups than i 've had doing @entity28			1
i had shoulder surgery before i did @entity28 , and my shoulder has never been stronger , so i think it 's great			1
every day you 're pushing your body to the limit and constantly challenging yourself			0
what do you do to recover ? i continue to work out , which usually helps with the soreness , but maybe just take the intensity down			0
i feel better when i move			0
when i sit or do n't do anything is when i get more sore or feel more sluggish			1
this year swimming actually helped a lot			2
it 's a great workout , great breathing -- but does n't beat you up as bad as say lifting a barbell 60 times over your head			2
so i 'd say swimming was a good recovery this year			2
do you take ice baths ? at the @entity28 i 'll do some ice baths every once in a while , because this year it was hot , a lot hotter than the years past			1
it 's just so much of a pain to do an ice bath at the house			0
let 's be honest ... an ice bath is not pleasant			0
what workout supplements do you take ? in the morning i do n't really eat a lot			2
i 'll take some type of creatine -- not a lot though			0
then throughout the day i 'll have a protein shake or two , depending on the workouts i 'm doing			0
i usually do n't eat that much during the day and then at night i eat a lot			2
what 's a typical dinner for the @entity27 on @entity18 ? anything			1
whatever my wife @entity172 decides to make , or we go out to eat			0
i 'm not real picky and at that point , since i usually have n't eaten a lot and have been working out all day , food is food			2
sometimes it 's not that healthy			0
but i try not to be ridiculous			0
@entity1 : learn more about @entity28 and try a @entity178 what was your celebration meal post-games ? oh man , what did i have that night ? i think it was a @entity185 burger			1
and then we had some pizza , too			0
you ca n't beat a good hamburger or steak -- some red meat , you know ? what is a typical day at the gym like for you ? usually i wake up around 9 or 9:30 , and i have a crew of people that i work out with			2
and we just kind of go by what we 've done the days past or how we feel or what we need to work on , and do some type of workout			0
then i 'll do some strength training depending on what strength cycle i 'm on , but really it 's just how i feel or what we 've done in days before or what has to be worked on			0
there 's no real schedule to be honest			0
if you looked at any given day , it would be six or seven workouts , but really it 's three or four sessions , that are anywhere from one hour to three hours ... whatever we can get in			0
do you still love @entity28 and working out or do you look at it as a job ? before the @entity28 i looked at it as a job			1
now i 'm starting to have fun again , and enjoy working out and staying healthy			0
you 've mentioned you 're going to move over to teams this year			0
are you not ready to be done with the sport , but individual is just too much commitment to do again ? yeah , that 's basically what it boils down to			0
it takes a lot of sacrifice and a lot of hard work			0
and you 've got to be a little bit crazy to be the best in the world at anything			0
we just adopted a baby girl and i do n't to want to let other things sacrifice or that			2
i 've made a good living for what i 've done so far			2
but i want to have some fun on a team			0
i grew up a team sport guy and i want to try that aspect of it			0
