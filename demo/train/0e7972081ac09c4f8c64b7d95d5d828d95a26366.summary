@entity0 , @entity1 -- the lengthy documents they initially were asked to sign used language even a native @entity4 speaker would struggle to understand			1
the @entity9 interpreters @entity10 first brought in for safety and cleanup training stirred painful memories and suspicions because they spoke to the elders with a @entity9 dialect and used what some described as " communist terminology			1
" the closings of fishing areas have been announced on radio stations these fishermen do n't follow , so some have piloted their boats where they should n't , which means tickets from the @entity27 keep coming			2
for the @entity9 - @entity29 living in the @entity31 region , the oil disaster is especially complicated			1
it 's made murky by language barriers , cultural misunderstandings and a history of challenges that have shaped them for more than half a century			1
their ties to seafood run deep and wide			1
a third of all fishermen in the @entity31 are @entity9 , making them arguably the most affected minority out there			1
more than 24,000 people of @entity9 origin live in @entity1 , according to the last completed census			1
about 6,000 live within a two - mile radius in the neighborhood of @entity49 -- distinguishing it , the area 's priest says , as the greatest concentration of @entity9 people outside of @entity55			1
in the rectory of @entity58 , the rev. @entity56 sits in front of an altar to his ancestors and his catholic faith			2
religious texts in @entity4 and his native tongue fill the high shelves around him , as do books bearing titles like " @entity68 , " " the evolution of @entity70 " and @entity72 's " @entity71			2
" here , he introduces some of the kafkaesque oil - disaster trials facing his own people			1
he talks about their distrust of lawyers -- " sharks , " he calls them -- who 've come in from out of state , circling them with promises and confusing papers			2
he mentions the mental health concerns -- depression , lack of sleep , tensions in homes -- that need to be addressed , a task made difficult by an absence of @entity9 - speaking therapists in a community that still stigmatizes admissions of emotional trouble			1
he worries about the lack of job training and opportunities for a people who 've worked in an industry that may suffer for @entity103 knows how long			1
" these are proud , active people who contribute to their own livelihood , and now they have to be in lines , " asking for handouts , he says			1
" it is a devastating blow			2
" about 80 percent of @entity9 - @entity29 in the @entity31 region are connected to the seafood industry through jobs that include fishing , shucking oysters , packing shrimp , and running stores and restaurants , the priest and others say			1
the work they do is something many brought with them from fishing villages in their native land , a place most of them fled as " boat people " after the 1975 fall of @entity128 and the end of the @entity130			1
that departure was for many the second time they 'd become refugees			1
they 'd already uprooted themselves and started over with nothing in 1954 , when their country divided into @entity140 and they , as the @entity143 minority living in @entity55 , ran from the @entity145 rule that took over the @entity140			1
the former archbishop @entity146 of the @entity147 reached out to them in refugee camps in @entity29 , inviting them to call his home theirs			2
so they came here in the ' 70s and ' 80s with the help of @entity156 and , over the next 30 years , reinvented their lives once more -- in a climate reminiscent of the country they 'd left behind			2
they worked hard in a familiar industry that did n't require them to master @entity4 , often leaving their children to be cared for by older siblings and relatives so they could put in long days			1
they created a self - reliant community where their own local businesses thrived			2
they planted acres of vegetable gardens along levees , incorporating the agricultural roots of their ancestors			2
today , people wearing the traditional conical straw hats stoop in their cultivated yards or walk along streets with names like @entity182			1
a trailer , lined with coolers of freshly caught shrimp for sale at hiked - up prices , is parked in front of a strip mall that includes @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192			2
@entity193 five years ago marked the third time they lost everything and had to start over			1
but it was also the storm that gave them a voice			2
the documentary " a village called @entity204 " -- a reference to the public housing project where they first settled -- debuted on @entity202 last month			2
it chronicles how the @entity9 - @entity29 living in @entity49 galvanized after @entity193 , making theirs among the first neighborhoods to rebuild			1
grass - roots organizers established agencies to fight for assistance and empower people , including one for youth called the @entity215 of @entity0 ( @entity216 - no )			1
the church , which began holding @entity219 just six weeks after the floodwaters destroyed what they 'd created , became a staging ground for construction help and community meals			2
health clinics sprouted up , as did a new charter school			0
and collectively , they protested a planned 90 - foot - high landfill of hurricane debris on their neighborhood 's edge , shutting down a move by the city government that they 'd never confronted en masse before			0
a few years later , in 2008 , they 'd help elect the nation 's first @entity9 - @entity29 congressman , @entity1 @entity238 @entity236			1
the next challenge : oil over a bowl of homemade pho , a @entity9 beef noodle soup , @entity241 provides a glimpse into how the community is mobilizing to face its newest challenge			1
he 's the 30 - year - old deputy director of the @entity58 of @entity248 ( @entity249 ) , established after @entity193 , and serves on the rapid response team created by @entity236 after the oil disaster			1
along with others on the team , he 's been crisscrossing the region , meeting with fishermen and others -- not just @entity9 -- to assess their needs , gather testimonies , answer questions and advocate on their behalf			1
they 've succeeded in gaining the ear of a @entity10 official , @entity263 , who among other things has approved the hiring of qualified and trained bilingual interpreters			0
" we had never been exposed to the @entity9 community , " says @entity263 , the @entity10 manager of government and public affairs for the lower 48 states and the @entity31			1
" clearly , it 's a tight - knit community , and it 's been a steep learning curve for us			0
the interaction has been great			0
" even with all he knows about navigating the system and securing whatever assistance is available , whether that 's food stamps or @entity10 claim dollars , @entity56 ca n't persuade some of his own relatives to get the help they so desperately need			0
" one of my wife 's uncles is a very proud man			0
i told him to come in and talk about services , " @entity56 says			0
" he said , ' i ca n't stand in line			0
what if someone sees me ? ' " while his wife 's uncle wo n't accept assistance , others in the state have driven hours to get simple answers to questions from agencies like the @entity249			0
the hope , @entity56 and others say , is that grass - roots organizations will sprout up elsewhere to help meet the growing and often different community needs			0
one such organization has already been formed in @entity306 , @entity307 , an area that is home to about 5,000 @entity9 - @entity29			1
the @entity308 of @entity309 and @entity310 , led by volunteers , is hoping to step in where the @entity0 organizations logistically ca n't			0
@entity314 , 36 , is working full - time -- on top of her real estate broker job -- to help wherever she can			0
she 's accompanying people to the @entity10 claims office			2
she 's meeting with fisherfolk to discuss their concerns and recognizes with frustration how unqualified she is to talk to them about fights in their marriages			0
she 's sending testimonials to the state judiciary , in an attempt to force @entity307 to expand assistance opportunities			0
and all the while , she 's worrying about what the future holds			0
she sees families falling behind on mortgages -- for their homes and their boats			0
at about $ 1 million a pop , many of the big @entity306 vessels require payments of $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 a month			0
the up to $ 5,000 a month that @entity10 is paying out to captains and boat owners is of little comfort to them , especially when there are home mortgages , too , college tuition payments and more			0
" they 've been doing this for 45 years , 50 years of their life			0
they 've relied on each other , " @entity351 says			0
" if this drags out , it will only get worse			0
" nearly 180 miles away , back over the @entity1 state line , @entity356 is racing around with her clipboard			0
she and her husband own @entity360 in @entity361 , a small fishing community			0
it 's a business they took over from her father - in - law , who 's standing around the dock in his " luck of the @entity368 " t - shirt			0
the shrimp being unloaded off their boat amounts to a third of what they usually bring in , says @entity56 , 27			0
it was out for two months , but given water closures imposed because of the oil disaster , access to shrimp was limited			1
" there 's nothing else we can do , " she says , refusing to ponder what the family 's alternative would be if life does n't get back to normal , and soon			0
" we 've never invested in anything else			0
" but rep. @entity236 holds out hope that the @entity9 community in the @entity31 will pull through -- because it always has			1
" we are resilient people			1
we are survivors , " he says			2
" it 's an obstacle in life , and we will overcome it			0
and we will emerge stronger			0

language and cultural barriers , troubled history complicate oil disaster for @entity9
seafood industry is *lifeline* for 80 percent of @entity9 living in the @entity31 region
starting over not new for people who came here as refugees and rebuilt after @entity193
congressman @entity236 : " we are resilient people . we are survivors . "
