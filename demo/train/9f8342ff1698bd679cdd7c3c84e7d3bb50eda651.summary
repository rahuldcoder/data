@entity1 tanks , @entity1 artillery , @entity1 air defense systems and @entity1 troops -- all heading into @entity5			1
that 's what @entity8 gen. @entity7 , the commander of @entity10 forces in @entity11 , said wednesday that his government has seen over the past few days -- @entity17 's latest such alleged incursion into the nation , parts of which remain in turmoil after months of violence			2
@entity1 officials frequently deny claims that the military has moved into disputed parts of the @entity5 , and this time is no exception			1
in a report from the country 's state - run @entity30 news agency , @entity1 military spokesman @entity27 blasted what he called @entity7 's " alarmist @entity34 allegations			1
" " we 've stressed many a time there are no real facts behind the acts of shaking the air by @entity43 officials , " @entity27 said , referring to the @entity36 capital , where @entity10 is based			1
@entity5 violence flares as ceasefire collapses a day earlier , @entity7 said @entity1 has moved " forces that are capable of being nuclear " into @entity47 , which was @entity5 territory until being folded into @entity1 on the heels of a government turnover earlier this year			1
@entity47 borders southeastern @entity5 , where much of the current unrest is focused and into which @entity1 troops allegedly have moved			1
" whether they are [ nuclear - equipped ] or not , we do n't know , " @entity7 , the top @entity8 general in @entity11 , said tuesday			0
" but they do have the kind of equipment there that could support that mission if required			0
" @entity1 president @entity60 has alluded to his country 's nuclear arsenal , amid criticism of @entity1 's actions			0
in late august , state - run @entity30 reported that he told a youth forum , " i want to remind you that @entity1 is one of the most powerful nuclear nations			2
this is a reality , not just words			0
" asked specifically about possible nuclear movement into @entity47 , @entity60 's spokesman @entity71 said , " @entity10 releases such statements almost on a daily basis			2
we have no intention to react and comment on them			0
" @entity1 defense minister @entity79 did say wednesday that his military is considering forming " a full - fledged and self - sufficient " unit in @entity47			1
those troops ' purpose would be " to ensure the military security of the country and its allies , " said @entity79 , according to another @entity30 report			0
" in many respects , this is connected with the situation in @entity5 , with fomentation of anti-russian moods on the part of @entity10 and reinforcement of foreign military presence in the immediate vicinity to our borders , " the defense minister said			1
opinion : @entity5 or @entity1 -- who will blink first ? the @entity103 @entity102 held an emergency meeting wednesday afternoon on the worsening situation , where one official warned of a return to serious fighting			1
" we are deeply concerned over the possibility of a return to full - scale fighting , " @entity109 , @entity103 assistant secretary - general for political affairs , told the @entity102			1
the alternative to all - out war , still a " catastrophe for @entity5 , " would be months of continuing " low - level battles marked by periods of increased hostilities and further casualties , " @entity109 said			2
all these accusations and actions come amid intensified fighting of late in southeastern @entity5			2
pro-russian rebels claim control of parts of that region , despite a push by @entity5 forces to defeat them			0
the two sides signed a ceasefire deal in september , raising hope that the months - long conflict was nearing an end			0
but now , fighting has returned to levels that preceded the ceasefire , a @entity140 security source who has detailed knowledge of the matter told @entity143			0
as @entity7 said tuesday , " the ceasefire is in name only at this point			0

another @entity5 official , @entity162 , alleged the " armored column " consisted of " a battalion tactical group of the @entity167 , " according to @entity164 state news agency			0
@entity1 accused of sending 32 tanks into @entity5 talking at a government meeting wednesday , @entity146 said that " of course , we expect ...			2
actions " by those forces moving into and around southeastern @entity5			0
he added , " i think the main task is to prepare for fighting			0
