-- after a string of real celebrity deaths last week , the @entity1 and online social networks killed a few more stars			1
pop star @entity6 was among those falsely claimed to be dead recently			1
despite what you may have read , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity6 , @entity11 and @entity12 are alive			0
fake news of their deaths flew across the @entity1 -- particularly on online social networks like @entity19 and @entity20 -- after @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 were reported dead			1
the situation is calling attention to the changing state of the news media : as information online moves faster and comes from more sources , it 's more difficult to verify what 's true and what may be shockingly false			1
some have downplayed the situation , saying the rumors are not harmful			2
others find the situation offensive in light of the actual deaths last week			2
@entity1 - savvy readers can tell the difference between fake news and real information that has been verified by a trusted blogger or mainstream news reporter , said @entity46 , managing editor at @entity47 , a celebrity news and gossip blog not associated with the rumors			1
" it 's easier than ever to publish stuff , and the human condition is a complicated thing			2
some people just like to be responsible for starting something , " he said , noting that the trend is not especially new			0
others say the fake deaths , or " death pranks , " show an inherent problem with the decentralization of news on the @entity1			1
the man who claims indirect responsibility for several of the recent fake celebrity deaths is @entity67 , whose site , @entity69 , allows users to input celebrity names into five false news templates with outlandish stories about their deaths			1
@entity67 said the site 's fans used its story - generation power to start rumors that @entity8 , @entity79 , @entity9 and @entity10 had died			1
traffic on his site jumped from a few thousand users per day to about 500,000 in the two days after @entity21 's death , he said			1
a fake story that appears to have been generated by the site claimed that @entity9 had died after falling off a cliff in @entity87			1
but while a small disclaimer tells readers the story is false , @entity67 said many @entity19 and @entity20 users re-post links after reading only a story headline			0
" i 'm absolutely flabbergasted by the success of this and the impact these social networks have on communication -- and the communication of misinformation , " he said			2
about 85 percent of the recent traffic on @entity67 's site came from @entity20 and @entity19 , he said , adding that the traffic does help him make money			0
@entity0 could not independently verify that the celebrity rumors started from @entity67 's site			1
@entity0 's user - generated news community , @entity106 , was criticized for spreading celebrity death rumors following @entity21 's death			1
one of the site 's users sent in a post saying @entity112 had died			2
that false news about the singer of " @entity115 " was not aired on @entity0 or @entity0 , both of which vet ireports for accuracy before using them in reporting			0
for pop star spears , the recent false news came across @entity19 , a micro-blogging site where users post 140 - character messages			0
after a post said @entity6 had died , a correction was posted to her @entity19 feed on sunday , saying " @entity6 's @entity19 was just hacked			2
the last message is obviously not true			0
she is fine and dandy spending a quiet day at home relaxing			0
" news surrounding deaths is very sensitive and must be correct , said @entity133 , president of @entity134 , an obituary site that verifies deaths , often through funeral homes , before posting			0
" you never want to kill somebody by accident , " she said			0
she added , " i do n't think there 's much good to say about somebody who would joke about something serious like that			0
" the fake news may not be all bad for celebrities			1
@entity8 , for example , went on @entity151 's " @entity150 " to dispel rumors that he had died			1
in the episode , host @entity153 jokes that he thinks @entity8 is dead even as the actor appears on stage beside him			0
@entity8 then posts to @entity19 to try to prove that he is still living			0
" oh my @entity157 ! ladies and gentlemen , i have huge news , " @entity153 says , upon reading @entity8 's tweet on his phone			2
" the dead can twitter			0
" @entity8 then reads his own false obituary into the camera .			0
