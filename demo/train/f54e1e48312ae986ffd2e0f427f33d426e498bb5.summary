@entity0 looks richer in the snow			1
@entity5 , as they always have , stroll the main boulevard , @entity7 , in their fur coats and hats on snowy evenings , basking in the holiday lights and decorations , their capital transformed into an icy wonderland			2
@entity5 's coffee shops are full of young @entity0 still willing to pay 300 to 400 rubles for a latte			1
but the foreign currency exchange shops i pass are an ominous sign			0
just a few weeks ago , 300 rubles was worth about $ 10			0
now , it 's about half that			0
thursday , i exchange dollars for rubles and get a rate of 54.20			0
by saturday it 's 57 rubles to the dollar			0
consumer prices are up about 8 % from a year ago			1
inflation is growing at its fastest pace in three years			0
in the food store where i used to shop , i search in vain for my favorite imported cheese			0
it 's fallen victim to @entity0 's ban on dairy , meat , fruit , poultry , fish and other products imported from the @entity40 -- @entity5 's retaliation for @entity43 and @entity44 economic sanctions over its actions in @entity46			1
even the price of bread , which holds a near - sacred place in @entity0 popular culture , is rising			1
the business daily kommersant reported that bread prices will increase 5 % to 10 % in the near future due to the rising price of " flour , grain , sugar , foreign raw materials , packing supplies and transportation costs			2
" food wholesalers want to adjust consumer prices more frequently , once a week instead of every 45 days , according to the paper			1
in @entity5 's working - class neighborhoods , the falling ruble is reawakening old fears and old methods of coping with economic uncertainty			1
some middle - aged @entity0 , who lived through the economic chaos of the early 1990s , are beginning to put away reserves of salt , matches , macaroni , flour and other staples			1
middle - class @entity0 are buying tvs , cars and household appliances , convinced that prices after @entity79 's will be higher			1
" @entity0 live one day at a time , " a 40 - year - old woman who works for a livery service tells me			1
" we never know what the future will bring			2
" a new @entity0 poll shows that @entity0 are losing confidence in the future and are making plans for only a few months in advance			1
in that poll , by @entity92 , 51 % of those questioned said they are confident in the future , down from 61 % in the spring of this year			2
nearly half said " life is difficult , but bearable			0
" the @entity43 and @entity44 imposed economic sanctions in response to president @entity98 's actions in @entity46 and @entity99 , but @entity98 blames the @entity40 for trying to weaken @entity0			1
his fellow citizens , by and large , agree ; @entity98 's latest public approval rating is an overwhelming 82 %			1
but some , especially among @entity0 's beleaguered political opposition , see a silver lining in the economy 's woes : the end , sooner or later , of the @entity98 regime			1
" my prognosis ? in three years the situation will change , " @entity110 of the liberal @entity111 told me at an opposition conference in @entity5			1
" the country is in economic crisis and no one in the government knows how to solve that			0
" the economy will tank , @entity110 predicted , " and this will elicit mass dissatisfaction among the public			0
that will activate political battles , and that will lead to a peaceful change of power			0
" several people i spoke with at the conference said there 's a perfect storm brewing that could sweep @entity98 from office : low oil prices resulting in plunging profits for @entity0 , @entity138 sanctions , and a faltering economy			1
but no one i spoke with wanted that " perfect storm " to end in revolution			1
the conference , " crisis in @entity0 - @entity145 : causes and @entity151 , " was held on december 12 , @entity0 's @entity146 , and brought together approximately 200 members of the opposition along with some liberal @entity44 politicians			1
it was co-sponsored by @entity0 's liberal opposition party , @entity111 -- short for the @entity154 of @entity0 / @entity155 -- and the transnational @entity44 party , the @entity156			2
one of the hosts : @entity158 , co-leader of @entity111 , who served as minister of finance from 1999 to 2000 and as @entity0 's prime minister from 2000 to 2004			2
@entity98 fired him , along with his cabinet , shortly before running for and winning a second presidential term			2
the current @entity165 policy , @entity158 told me , is " leading nowhere , " and he predicted growing economic and political problems			0
" we want to force the present leadership of the country , using pressure from society , to change its aggressive course in its international as well as domestic policy and abide by the @entity0 constitution , " he said			2
just where that pressure will come from , however , is not clear			0
historically , the opposition has been divided internally , and so far , @entity98 has most @entity0 on his side			1
one participant in the conference , who works in a nongovernmental organization and did not want her name used , told me that @entity98 wo n't willingly leave power			2
" " he will never leave of his own accord , " she said , " so somebody will have to help him			0
and they will do that once they are frustrated enough			0
" his inner circle , she said , could turn on him			0
" they are @entity0 like everybody else , so their patience is very , very long , " she told me			0
" one day , however , it will crack			0
that 's what i think			0
what it will take to crack , i do n't know			0

consumer prices in @entity5 soar , ruble falls , some @entity0 stockpile essentials
poll shows @entity0 ' confidence in future is fading
@entity0 president @entity98 blames economic woes on the @entity40 ; his approval rating still *sky* - high
@entity0 opposition hopes economic " perfect storm " could bring down @entity98 regime
