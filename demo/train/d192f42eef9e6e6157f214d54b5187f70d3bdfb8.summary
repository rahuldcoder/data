the @entity8 , an animal - rights protection group in @entity7 , pulled off the rescue			1
last friday night , a volunteer tipped off the group that hundreds of caged dogs were being loaded onto trucks in @entity5 and headed to various restaurants in @entity16 province			1
the group dispatched a team of five to block the dog - trader while they posted microblogs online calling for help from animal - loving citizens			1
after a standoff and negotiation , the group agreed to pay the dog trader 83,000 yuan ( $ 13,000 ) to secure the caged dogs ' freedom , said @entity8 president @entity29			1
" it 's a compromise we took in an effort to let the dogs free — they are visibly suffering for being packed in small cages with very limited space			2
we spent hours negotiating with the trader , " @entity29 told @entity0 in a phone interview			0
" finally with the help of local government he was willing to hand over the dogs in exchange for 83,000 yuan — 60,000 for personal compensation , another 20,000 for cages that we lack			2
" qiming volunteers are now helping settle down the dogs , according to state - run media			2
dog meat has long been a popular dish in certain regions of @entity3			1
but over time this cultural and culinary tradition is getting more and more unpopular , as international and @entity3 animal protection organizations increase pressure against the dog meat trade			1
@entity3 's attitudes on pets , palates change most dogs rescued saturday were severely dehydrated			1

on the center 's official blog , the group frequently updates the dogs ' latest conditions and solicits donations or voluntary assistance from animal lovers			2
" some dogs were stolen , and now their owners come to us to take back their pets			0
many would leave with a certain amount of money as appreciation for our work , " @entity86 told @entity0			0
" once we 've finished the health check up procedures , we 'll start helping the dogs find new homes			0
" @entity86 says through the rescue she and her fellow volunteers hope to send the general public one message : " no trading , no killing			0
" meanwhile , dog trading remains rife in certain regions in @entity3 due to lack of a national law on animal welfare and protection			1
" a major part of our work is proposing drafts of laws and regulations under which the government can effectively punish this kind of behavior , " @entity29 added			0
" now we can only tackle the traders one at a time , and can hardly tell whether they 'll go back to the business again			0
