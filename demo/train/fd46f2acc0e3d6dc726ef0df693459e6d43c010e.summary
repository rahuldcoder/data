-- nature abhors a vacuum but terrorism relishes one			0
and @entity4 appears to be offering new space for @entity6 and other militant groups , as political rivalries and sectarian animosities deepen			1
the coordinated bomb explosions across @entity11 thursday -- which killed more than 60 people -- bear the hallmark of @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , which is closely associated with @entity6			2
no other group in @entity4 has shown itself capable of such synchronized suicide attacks			0
some , but not all , of the bombings were in @entity19 neighborhoods ; frequently @entity6 's targets appear indiscriminate as part of a strategy to sow fear and stir sectarian tensions			1
the attacks come as @entity4 's @entity19 prime minister , @entity26 , demands the surrender of @entity4 's @entity29 vice-president , @entity28 , on charges that he ordered bombings and assassinations			1
@entity28 has taken refuge in the northern @entity35 - administered part of @entity4 , and the country 's always - fragile tripartite balance now appears to be in grave danger -- with the restraining effect of a @entity41 military presence gone			1
@entity42 , of the @entity43 , believes the presence of @entity41 troops helped stabilize @entity4 's political discourse , and " their premature removal from the political space has altered the manner on which @entity4 's actors interact			1
" but even before their departure , there were ominous signs , as two largely @entity29 provinces declared their intent to become autonomous regions			0
those moves appeared to have the support -- or at least sympathy -- of vice-president @entity62			0
@entity6 in @entity4 has shown before that one of its aims is to spark sectarian bloodshed between @entity4 's @entity29 and @entity19			1
under the leadership of @entity67 , it carried out a double bombing of one of @entity19 's most holy places -- the @entity72 shrine in @entity73 -- in february 2006			2
the plan nearly worked : there were retaliatory attacks against @entity29 mosques and for nearly two years @entity4 was mired in sectarian bloodletting			2
in words that may apply equally today , @entity4 's national security adviser at the time , @entity80 , said : " the main aim of these terrorist groups is to drag @entity4 into a civil war			1
" while political violence in @entity4 is nowhere near its peak of 2006 - 07 , it has never gone away			0
@entity14 regrouped after the death of @entity67 , and after losing support within the @entity29 community because of its vicious attacks on civilians			0
@entity4 officials speak of a " third generation " of @entity6 in @entity4 , with fewer foreign fighters and more battle - hardened @entity4 sunnis			1
analysts say @entity14 has turned to bank raids and other forms of crime to finance its activities , and is targeting police patrols in areas where it is strong , largely north of @entity11			0
@entity41 officials say that unlike @entity6 under @entity67 , the group no longer holds swathes of territory , but acts in smaller cells			1
it is strongest in the city of @entity112 , 260 miles north of @entity11 and one of @entity4 's many sectarian faultlines			1
the city is a base for @entity14 but rarely suffers from its violence			0
but it has shown it can operate across the country			0
on one day in august , 13 people were killed and dozens injured in attacks blamed on @entity14			0
two bombs in @entity11 killed 18 people at the end of october			0
@entity41 officials expected @entity14 to step up its campaign on the heels of a @entity41 withdrawal			1
the former spokesman for the @entity41 military in @entity4 , major general @entity129 said : " it 's likely they will try to harbor their resources for a significant series of attacks after the @entity41 military withdrawal if for no other reason than to demonstrate their relevance			1
" he added that " since august @entity6 has been working really hard to foment sectarian conflict , " and warned that " if the @entity4 security forces are not able to put pressure on them , they could regenerate			2
" but when the @entity41 military left @entity4 , it took its intelligence - gathering with it -- making the job of @entity4 counter-terrorism units more challenging still			2
" without all the enablers we provide , there 's no doubt there will be less capability than there is right now , " @entity129 said a few weeks ago			0
@entity19 militias -- often supported by @entity158 -- have emerged to counter the threat of @entity29 militancy			1
and as @entity4 security forces have gone after @entity29 militants , the balance of power has tipped toward these @entity19 militias -- groups like @entity166 and @entity167			1
@entity41 officials contend that @entity19 groups sponsored by @entity158 were a greater danger than @entity6 to the country 's stability			1
despite his good relations with @entity158 , prime minister @entity26 is well aware that its influence is a double - edged sword -- and is anxious that @entity4 does not become a battleground between the @entity14 republic and the @entity29 monarchy in @entity179			1
" we do not allow @entity158 to use us against others that @entity158 has problems with , and we do not allow others to use us against @entity158 , " he said last week			0
but @entity4 has little control over its own borders , and a former @entity41 military officer who served in @entity4 told @entity0 last week that its security forces were still largely divided on sectarian lines			2
the situation in neighboring @entity190 adds another dimension to the situation			0
thousands of @entity29 took refuge there after the fall of @entity195 , but if the regime of president @entity197 falls , they may need to return home			0
@entity26 has already said that @entity197 's fall could set off a regional sectarian crisis -- one reason perhaps that his government has opposed @entity204 sanctions against @entity190			0
and some @entity4 @entity19 see a @entity179 hand at work in @entity190			1
for its part , @entity158 has all the more reason to reinforce its influence in @entity4 should its long - time @entity211 ally in @entity212 be ousted			2
this regional volatility only adds fuel to an always combustible internal situation			0
last week , @entity41 defense secretary @entity216 said after a visit to @entity11 : " the leadership of @entity4 is committed to a strong and sovereign and independent @entity4 and for that reason i am confident they are going to succeed			2
" @entity6 and its enemies at the other end of the religious spectrum are doing their best to prove him wrong .			0

bombings are an indication that terror groups in @entity4 are finding space to operate
attack came as @entity4 's @entity19 prime minister orders arrest of @entity29 vice-president
@entity4 officials speak of a new @entity6 made up of @entity29 fighters ; @entity41 officials say @entity19 groups sponsored by @entity158 are a bigger danger
meanwhile the prime minister does not want @entity4 to be a proxy battleground for @entity179 and @entity158
