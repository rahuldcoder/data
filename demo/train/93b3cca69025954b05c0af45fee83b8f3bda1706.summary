-- @entity2 's movie " contagion , " which opened in theaters friday , speaks to globalization in an era when risk is shared by the entire planet , but benefits remain prioritized to exclusive , usually wealthy populations			1
this terrible global risk / benefit calculus means viruses may now swiftly enter every region of the world , but the protective gear , treatments and vaccines necessary to save lives remain primarily available to lucky residents of the @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and a handful of other countries			1
there is no governing structure for a pandemic , and little more than vague political pressure to ensure limited access to life - sparing tools and medicines for more than half the world population			1
" contagion " is an action - thriller about the outbreak of a deadly virus			1
the producers behind " contagion " asked me to serve as a consultant because i wrote " the coming plague " in the 1990s and worked as a reporter in at least 20 epidemics , including those of @entity44 in the 1980s , @entity45 and @entity46			1
from my very first meeting with " contagion " director @entity2 and screenwriter @entity49 , i stressed that the days when epidemics could be tackled locally had long passed			1
i argued that the movie had to demonstrate that disease threats in the 21st century are global threats , but the world lacks an appropriate system of governance and trade to permit a genuinely equitable response			1
without equity , pandemic battles will fail			1
viruses will simply recirculate , and perhaps undergo mutations or changes that render vaccines useless , passing through the unprotected populations of the planet			0
a man lucky enough to receive an effective vaccine against a new viral threat in @entity70 may be re-exposed a year later to a mutated version of that germ that circulated among unimmunized populations in poor countries , only to slam @entity75 in a second wave			1
that is what happened with influenza in 1918 , which spread across @entity22 in a mild form , returning months later in its terrifying virulence and killing more than 50 million people ( by recently adjusted estimates perhaps 100 million people )			0
those who see " contagion " will recognize these themes in its plot : @entity94 villagers clamor for vaccines , internet users gravitate to false claims and order anything they think may help , the entire world sees the pandemic unfold on tv and the @entity102 and grows universally fearful			1
@entity103 spreads globally , even as governments fail in their ineptitude and exhaustion , with police , fire , public health and political leaders themselves falling victim to the virus			0
drs. @entity113 and @entity114 , the other scientific consultants to " contagion " and i did everything we could to make the movie accurate			1
but of course it is not a documentary , and the events depicted have , thankfully , not transpired			0
what audiences see is the best rendition of events likely to unfold in such a pandemic as can be estimated , based on how governments , public health leaders , scientists , drug companies , communities , law enforcement and international agencies have responded to recent outbreaks of less virulent germs			1
the hypothetical @entity145 - 1 in " contagion " is based in parts of the @entity149 virus that first surfaced in @entity150 in 1998 , the @entity94 @entity46 outbreak of 2003 , @entity144 swine flu in 2009 , @entity45 in @entity139 in 1995 and government reactions to the anthrax mailings of 2001			1
it is part fantasy , part reality and totally possible			0
as was believed by many in 2000 of the idea of @entity156 successfully attacking the @entity20 , and in 2004 of the likelihood the levees protecting @entity159 would collapse , the ideas shown in " contagion " constitute a low probability event that would have high consequences			1
assessing how likely such things as the 9/11 attack and @entity164 are and determining how to prepare and respond are the jobs of government			2
but governance is a tricky concept			0
a country may be authoritarian , even brutal , but govern its infrastructure quite well			0
of course , the preferred goal is democracy that is well guided , resilient and strong			0
we live in a time , however , when people are angry at their governments , both locally and nationally , and austerity is the maxim in all but the over-heated emerging markets of @entity94 , @entity179 and perhaps @entity180 and @entity181			0
" @entity187 " is the official dirty word of most of the candidates for the @entity185 nomination for president of the @entity20			0
internationally , mechanisms of global health governance are very weak			2
the @entity190 is running a $ 1 billion budget deficit , laying off more than 20 % , or 300 , of its employees this year			0
among the other players in the multilateral health picture only @entity197 , the alliance responsible for child vaccinations , is financially stable and has vibrant leadership			0
most other global health entities are struggling , both financially and politically			2
in the @entity20 , politicians post- 2001 grew tired of our @entity201 , long the world 's premier disease - fighter			2
as i delineate in my new book , " i heard the @entity206 : how @entity20 responded to the 9/11 and @entity212 , " political leaders blamed the @entity201 for failures in the response to the anthrax mailings			2
by the end of the @entity216 administration , @entity213 tilted in a new direction , demanding spending on obesity and diabetes			0
under the @entity222 administration , the @entity201 is led by the very able dr. @entity223 , but congressional mandates have shifted its resources and focus from epidemics and outbreaks to obesity management and chronic disease issues			0
billions of dollars were spent post- 2001 to create systems of high security laboratories around the world , and stockpiles of vaccines and drugs			2
but the biggest chunk of change in that pursuit went for smallpox readiness , despite the dearth of evidence that @entity156 or any other terrorist entity possessed smallpox with intent to use the germ as a weapon			0
all the fancy technology invented post-anthrax will be of little use against a previously unknown , novel entity as depicted in " contagion			2
" moreover , technology for public health is useless if the workforce of doctors , nurses , lab technicians , scientists and other public health workers is weak			0
in these recessionary times , public health budgets are falling to budget axes from @entity263 to @entity264			0
when moviegoers watch " contagion , " i hope they will ask themselves a few very important questions and demand answers from their leaders			2
when an outbreak occurs , what agency is responsible for spotting it , assessing the threat and responding ? if @entity190 funding is diminished and its staffing cut , what organization deals with governing global responses and striving for equitable access to the treatments and vaccines ? when lies and exploitation fill the internet , how can health leaders counter the deceptions , conspiracy theories and profiteering ? when drug companies push pandemic exigencies aside amid concerns about profit - losses , what government can exert appropriate pressure to get billions of doses of drugs and vaccines made in a rapid , safe manner ? " contagion " should serve as a wake - up call not only about the germs , but perhaps more importantly about the frailty of governance , nationally and worldwide			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity306 .			1

@entity306 says movie " contagion " shows global risk of pandemic shared by rich , poor
she says without global equity in the ability to respond , everyone would be *affected*
she says politics , economy have lead to shifting priorities , leaving world poorly prepared
@entity323 : movie a *warning* : global *coordinated* , equitable response to a pandemic needed
