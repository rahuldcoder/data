this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity13 , @entity14 : it 's the best day of the school - week and you 're about to get a front - row seat to world headlines without a single commercial			1
in other words , @entity0			1
i 'm @entity23 ! first up : @entity24 @entity25 : first up : the giant @entity27 flag was recovered in the aftermath of the september 11th attacks in @entity30			1
that was a little over nine years ago , the same day that @entity32 was born			1
she was one of the victims of a shooting last saturday in @entity35 , @entity4			1
so the flag was raised in @entity32 's honor with those who knew and loved the girl walking past it , on the way to a service to remember her			1
five other people were killed in the shooting			1
speaking at a memorial service for all of them on wednesday night , president @entity44 said he wanted @entity47 to be as good as @entity32 envisioned it			1
@entity27 president @entity44 : here on @entity50 , we place our hands over our hearts , and we commit ourselves as @entity27 to forging a country that is forever worthy of her gentle , happy spirit			1
may @entity56 bless and keep those we 've lost in restful and eternal peace			1
may he love and watch over the survivors			1
and may he bless the @entity27			1
@entity25 : @entity4 representative @entity60 is a survivor of the shooting			1
she 's one of six people still in the hospital , and the only one in critical condition			1
wednesday , @entity60 opened her eyes for the first time since the shooting and gave her husband a sign she could hear him			1
@entity5 @entity69 @entity25 : @entity70 is n't the only country dealing with ravaging floodwaters right now			1
we 're gon na take you to @entity5 , @entity47 , a nation in its summer rainy season			1
rains that are out of hand in some places			1
we want you to look at this -- families that are in " extreme risk " of being washed away			1
this includes people in the mountains , and people near riverbeds , as landslides , mudslides , and rising waters leave thousands homeless			1
around 400 people have died , many are missing			1
some families are living in schools and gyms			1
in some spots , the only dry areas you can see are roofs and tree - tops			1
and more rains are in the forecast			1
the country 's government is taking some heat for poor disaster planning and allowing people to build homes in dangerous , mountain areas			1
@entity111 @entity25 : this is what happens when @entity114 's most famous volcano gets active			1
tremors started rumbling in @entity117 's @entity116 on tuesday			1
by wednesday , you can see what was going on			1
the volcano 's on the island of @entity122 , about 18 miles from the nearest town			1
it may be spewing ash , but it does n't seem to be threatening anyone at the moment			1
that was n't the case in 1669 , the date of @entity116 's most violent eruption , which killed 20,000 people			1
@entity133 @entity134 student news : see if you can i.d. me			1
i was born in @entity137 , @entity138 in 1929			1
my name was changed from @entity140 when i was five years old			1
in 1964 , i became the youngest person at the time to win the @entity142			1
i 'm dr. @entity143 , one of the most famous figures in the @entity27 civil rights movement			1
@entity146 @entity25 : many consider @entity143 the face of the civil rights movement			2
between 1957 and 1968 , @entity140 traveled over six million miles and gave more than 2,500 speeches			2
his message : equality through non-violence			2
dr. @entity140 organized boycotts and protests			2
he worked with presidents on creating civil rights laws			2
and in 1963 , he helped lead the march on @entity159 where dr. @entity140 gave his famous " @entity161 " speech			2
in that , he discussed his vision for a world where people would be judged by their character , rather than their skin color			2
on april 4th , 1968 , dr. @entity143 was assassinated in @entity168			2
four days later , the idea of a federal holiday honoring him was first introduced in @entity172			2
that proposal became law in 1983 and the first nationwide observance of the martin luther king holiday was in 1986			2
the holiday is on the third monday of january every year , which is this coming monday , january 17th			2
many people use it as an opportunity to help out with community service projects			2
for everyone , it 's a chance to remember @entity140 's dream and the legacy that he left in his work to achieve it			2
school lunches @entity25 : pizza sticks , tater tots , and hot dogs : the government wants those off your school lunch menu and replaced with foods like chef salad , baked sweet potato fries , and whole wheat spaghetti			1
it 's a new proposal from the @entity27 @entity202 and part of the @entity44 administration 's efforts to cut down on childhood obesity			1
healthier foods often cost more , so the government plans to help poorer schools pay for the changes			1
critics say it should n't be up to the federal government to decide what schools are allowed to serve -- that it 's a state or local issue			1
the rule would limit calories for school breakfasts and lunches			1
if it takes effect , you could see changes several months down the road			2
@entity227 @entity134 student news : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity231 's journalism students at @entity232 in @entity233 , @entity234 ! what is the atomic symbol for gold ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity241 , c ) go or @entity242 ) hg ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the @entity246 word for gold is aurum ; that 's why its symbol is @entity250			2
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! how @entity254 is mined @entity25 : gold , money and dreams : a dangerous combination that has been the downfall of many and the success of a few			2
the california gold rush of 1849 does n't scratch the surface of gold 's historic lure			2
ancient @entity266 and @entity267 wore it			2
entire currencies were based on it			2
but why gold instead of other metals ? well , it does n't tarnish or corrode			2
it 's easy to work with and shape			2
and it 's very hard to destroy			0
@entity276 takes us far underground , where modern miners cash in on methods their predecessors , did n't even dream about			0
( begin video ) @entity283 , @entity285 officer : your self - rescuer is going to go probably on your right - hand side			0
@entity276 , @entity289 : we 're gearing up to go two miles deep into one of the biggest gold mines in the country			0
i ca n't believe we 're two @entity296 buildings down below the surface of the @entity50			0
and we still have quite a ways to go			0
hunting for gold goes all the way back to 4,000 b.c. and today , the obsession continues			0
here , in @entity254 's @entity303 in rural @entity6 , more than one million ounces of gold were mined last year alone			0
that 's over $ 1 billion worth			0
@entity305 , @entity306 : geology has figured out where the pot of ore is , then they just point us toward it			0
@entity313 : but finding gold these days is much more complex and expensive than just , well , panning for it			0
in fact , you ca n't even see the gold in this mine			0
i mean , it 's amazing to me to think that this is gold , but it is			0
@entity324 , @entity306 : yes			0
@entity313 : it 's right here			0
you ca n't see it			0
@entity313 : miners have to drill and blast through layers and layers of rock to reach the gold			0
@entity326 : there 's gold in this			0
and what i 'm going to do is turn this into a pile of muck			0
@entity313 : it looks like dirt , but muck is actually gold ore			0
tiny particles of gold that will eventually make up a gold brick			0
@entity326 : i 'm going to get about 10 truckloads out of here			0
about 10 ounces of gold - 10 to 15 ounces of gold at $ 1,400 an ounce			0
and we 'll do this several times during a day 's work			0
@entity313 : not bad money			0
@entity326 : not bad money			0
@entity313 : so , after the gold ore is mined , about 400 tons of it goes in massive trucks just like this one			0
of that , only four ounces is pure gold			0
it 's taken , it 's crushed , then it 's taken to a mill and then it 's refined			0
@entity370 , process division manager , @entity372 - @entity371 : after of the ore is crushed and ground , we leach the gold out			0
from there we put it into a pressure - cooker environment , high temperature and pressure with various chemicals , and that pulls the gold out			0
this is the final step before pouring the gold bar			0
@entity313 : @entity254 mines gold for around $ 300 an ounce , and gold is selling for record highs , around $ 1,400 an ounce			0
those big margins mean jobs			0
something desperately needed in @entity6 , a state struggling with the highest in unemployment and foreclosure rates in the country			0
@entity398 , @entity399 : i can provide for my family			0
you know ? and i do n't know any other job in this world that can -- i get paid for what i get paid and survive now these days , the way the prices are			0
@entity326 : there 's job security here with gold that high			0
not going to run out of work			0
( @entity413 ) before we go @entity25 : with snow falling and daily temperatures in the 20s this time of year , ideas for outdoor activities can come to a stalemate			0
but not for a pair of local artists in @entity422 , @entity423			0
someone had this kingly idea for them to sculpt an ice chess set ! do n't know how long they pawn - dered the proposal , but it took over a month and a half for them to piece this together and let the game begin			0
goodbye @entity25 : it 's something people can play by day , and by knights			0
a board to keep freedom in check , mate ! i 'm @entity23 , and our next move is gon na be january 18th ! enjoy the martin luther king holiday , and we 'll see you on tuesday !			0
