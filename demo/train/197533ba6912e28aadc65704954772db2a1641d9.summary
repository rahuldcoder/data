@entity0 arrived in court ahead of his defense 's closing arguments in @entity6 , @entity7 , on monday in a dark wool scarf after fighting off a weekend flu that kept him out of court last week			1
" i had a high fever , " he told @entity1 during the coffee break at monday 's trial			1
" but i 'm better now			0
" @entity16 , who was the captain of the @entity18 cruise ship when it crashed into the rocks off the @entity22 island of @entity23 , in january 2012 , is facing 26 years in prison for charges of causing a maritime disaster , abandoning ship and multiple counts of manslaughter for the 32 people who lost their lives in the accident			1
a three - judge panel heard testimony from technical experts , passengers and crew members who were on the vessel at the time of the accident			0
during the 19 - month trial , they also heard from the captain 's female guest on the cruise , @entity45 , a @entity46 dancer who testified under duress that she was in a romantic relationship with the captain and that she was with him on the bridge when the accident occurred			1
@entity16 's lead lawyer @entity52 began his closing arguments on monday by referring to the fact that the champagne bottle used to christen the ill - fated vessel when it was put into service in 2006 did not break			1
" everything about this ship and this process since then has been a mystery so far , " he said			1
@entity52 then addressed each of the charges against the captain , starting with causing a shipwreck and maritime disaster			1
he repeated the accusation that because his helmsman @entity69 allegedly did not understand @entity70 -- a language he was required to speak -- when @entity16 gave the orders to turn the ship away from the island , he , in fact , caused the accident , not @entity16			1
@entity69 was subpoenaed to testify , but his last known address was in @entity76 and he could not be forced to come to the court in @entity7			0
@entity52 said @entity16 had been vilified from the moment the ship wrecked , and that the negative image has hurt his case			1
" this man , the accused , " he said pointing to @entity16 , " was arrested immediately , he was prejudged as an assassin			1
" he then went on to criticize the prosecutor who referred to @entity16 as an " idiot " in his closing arguments last week			1
" @entity16 is a good man , " he said			2
" he is not an idiot			0
" he then suggested that finding @entity16 not guilty would actually be good for @entity7 's image , somehow restoring it in the eyes of the world who have seen this case as an example of @entity95 ineptitude			2
@entity16 's defense has hinged in part on alleged malfunctions of the ship 's equipment and infrastructure , including claims that the ship had faulty watertight doors and generators , and that the elevators did not work when the ship was listing			1
" everything that did not work on the ship is part of the cause of the accident , " @entity52 told the court			2
" lights did n't work			0
" these claims were hard to verify because much of the ship was immersed off the coast of @entity23 for many months after the accident			0
@entity52 tried to explain why his client left the ship ahead of so many passengers , part of the charge of abandoning ship			1
he used an elaborate graphic to illustrate the inclination of the ship at the time @entity16 apparently lost his balance and fell into the lifeboat that took him to shore			1
he said that once on shore , @entity16 was able to conduct the rescue operation and that he never lost control of the operation			2
@entity52 then addressed the famous exchange between @entity135 -- commander of the @entity137 the night of the accident -- and @entity16 , during which @entity135 told @entity16 to " get back on board for f * * k 's sake			2
" @entity52 called @entity135 's tone degrading and said the commander was unprofessional and egotistic at a moment when he should have been a voice of calm			0
@entity52 suggested it was @entity135 's stern manner , rather than @entity16 's apparent ineptitude , that damaged @entity7 's reputation			2
he then showed what were intended to be compromising photos of @entity135 with a local @entity95 journalist to imply that @entity135 was involved in some sort of conspiracy to set up @entity16			2
" in the exchange that gained national attention , @entity135 was painted as a hero when he should not have been , " @entity52 said			0
@entity52 said his client could not have returned to the ship when it was on its side without risking his life			0
" he 's not superman or a spider , " he told the court , before asking them to " absolve @entity16 of abandoning ship			1
" addressing the manslaughter charges , @entity52 tried to bolster his argument that because no one died on impact when the ship slammed into the rocks , @entity16 can not be held liable			1
everyone who perished lost their lives as a result of the chaotic evacuation , he said			0
@entity52 defended @entity16 's decision to delay the call to abandon ship by nearly an hour			1
" stop for a minute to consider what would have happened if he had abandoned ship 1 kilometer from shore , " @entity52 said			0
" there could be 4,500 dead , not 32			0
" ( there were 4,229 passengers and crew on the ship ) five costa officials , including the head of the crisis center , @entity191 , were granted plea bargains with fines paid by @entity195 company and suspended prison sentences , @entity52 said			0
@entity191 and @entity16 were on the phone more than a dozen times between the moment the @entity18 hit the rocks and when the call to abandon ship was made , he said			1
@entity52 accused the @entity204 chairman @entity203 of interfering in the case by moving a large number of @entity204 employees from @entity208 to @entity209 , and essentially paying the fines and buying freedom for the other suspects			0
" @entity16 should be judged like the others at fault , " he said			2
@entity16 was denied a plea bargain similar to that his five colleagues were granted			2
@entity52 instead insisted that money was the motivation behind the @entity204 company trying to pin the blame on @entity16			2
" there is a lot of money at play here , " he told the court			0
" there is a lot of money at risk			0
" @entity16 's third lawyer @entity228 , who is handling the technical aspects of the defense , said that @entity16 navigated the ship " with an organization " -- not single - handedly			1
" he was annoying as a commander , " @entity228 said , referring to @entity16 as someone whose attention to detail borders on perfectionism			0
lawyers for 16 civil parties , including the island of @entity23 , which are included in criminal trials in @entity7 , will have a chance to offer final arguments along with the prosecutor			0
then @entity16 's defense team will have one more chance at a brief final rebuttal before the three - judge panel retires to deliberate			0
a verdict could come on tuesday evening or , more likely , on wednesday .			0
