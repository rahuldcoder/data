-- the ozone hole over @entity3 in 2008 is larger in both size and ozone loss than last year , but not as large as in 2006 , the @entity1 said tuesday			1
some chemical processes produce ozone - depleting gases			0
the hole is a thinning area in the ozone layer over @entity3 and the size of the hole varies every year depending on weather conditions			2
this year , the size of the thinned area reached about 27 million square kilometers ( 10.4 million square miles ) , compared to 25 million square kilometers ( 9.65 million square miles ) in 2007			1
in 2006 , the hole was a record 29 million square kilometers ( 11.2 million square miles ) , larger than @entity17 , the @entity1 said			1
the @entity1 announced its results based on information from @entity21 and @entity22 researchers who analyzed satellite data			0
depletion of ozone is caused by extreme cold temperatures at high altitude and the presence of ozone - destroying gases , such as chlorine and bromine , in the atmosphere , the @entity1 said			2
those gases originate from man - made products like chlorofluorocarbons , or @entity35 , which were phased out under a global agreement two decades ago but continue to linger in the atmosphere			0
@entity38 is a protective atmospheric layer found at an altitude of about 25 kilometers ( 15.5 miles )			0
it acts as a sunlight filter , shielding life on @entity44 from harmful ultraviolet rays that put humans at greater risk of skin cancer and cataracts and harm marine life , the agency said .			1

2008 ozone hole larger than in 2007 , @entity1 says
it covers area of about 27 million square kilometers
ozone layer acts as a sunlight filter , shielding @entity44 from some ultraviolet rays
