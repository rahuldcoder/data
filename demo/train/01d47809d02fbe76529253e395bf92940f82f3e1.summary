" the person looks forward to retirement , " @entity9 said			0
@entity14 was one of three states where three tickets matched the winning numbers -- 2 , 4 , 23 , 38 and 46 , with a @entity19 of 23 -- amounting to an equal share of roughly $ 218.6 million , before taxes , under the annuity option			1
the @entity14 winner , who bought the winning ticket at a @entity26 's convenience store in @entity27 , chose the cash option to collect the winnings -- $ 157 million			1
" they were still just in awe that they had won it , " @entity9 said of the winner , who did n't know the ticket was a winner until monday			2
the other winning tickets were purchased in @entity38 and @entity39			1
the @entity14 winner is the first to officially come forward , just a week after the winning numbers were picked			1
meanwhile , @entity38 lottery officials have been responding to a flurry of questions from the media this week after a @entity45 - area woman told the @entity46 that she had one of the winning tickets			1
however , in a bizarre twist of the story , @entity49 , a 37 - year - old single mother of seven who works at @entity51 , told the @entity46 on friday that she is n't sure where she last had the ticket			2
