-- surveys indicate that most @entity2 did n't think shutting down the government in an attempt to dismantle the new health care law was a good idea			1
they apparently feel the same way about blocking an increase in the nation 's debt ceiling to stop @entity11 , according to a new national poll released on wednesday			1
a @entity0 / @entity14 survey also indicates that a majority of the public would point fingers at @entity18 in @entity19 if the nation 's ability to borrow more money is not increased			1
with the federal government shut down due to a bitter partisan standoff over spending and the @entity11 , an even more chilling deadline is approaching			0
the government faces a debt ceiling crunch around october 17 , when it expects to run out of options to keep below the legal cap on federal borrowing			0
congressional republicans have signaled they want to use this issue to again go after @entity11 , which would set up a new fight with @entity36 and @entity37 , who says he wo n't negotiate			2
according to the poll , 56 % of @entity2 said it would be a bad thing if the debt ceiling was not raised , with 38 % saying it would be a good thing for the country			1
by a 51 % to 43 % margin , the public said it is more important to raise the debt ceiling than to delay @entity11			1
a larger majority , 64 % to 27 % , in a @entity48 survey released tuesday said they opposed blocking an increase in the debt ceiling as a way to dismantle the health care law			2
if the debt ceiling is not raised , just over half of those questioned in the @entity0 poll , 53 % , said congressional republicans would be more responsible rather than @entity37 , with 31 % pointing more fingers at the president			1
those numbers are little changed from july 2011 , the last time @entity37 and @entity19 fought over the debt ceiling , which was eventually raised			1
as with the battle over the government shutdown , the poll indicated that @entity36 and @entity18 do n't see eye to eye over raising the debt ceiling			1
" most republicans think that it would be a good thing for the country if the debt ceiling is not raised , but only 18 % of @entity36 agree , " said @entity0 polling director @entity63			2
" among most other major demographics groups , failure to raise the debt ceiling is seen as a bad thing			0
" " you have bipartisan consensus among economists that not raising the debt ceiling would be a disaster , but politically you have a divide			0
yes , more people say raise the debt ceiling and fight the health care debate somewhere else , but you have @entity18 lawmakers going home , most of them to safe @entity18 districts			2
and they 're being told by many of their constituents not to worry about it , ' you do n't have to raise the debt ceiling ' , " @entity0 chief national correspondent @entity83 said			2
the survey also indicates independents are split			0
" here 's a sales problem for the president			0
even among independents , a pretty even divide on whether raising the debt ceiling is a good or bad thing , " @entity83 added			0

the survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points			0
what do you think ? here 's your chance to weigh in below			0
which do you think is more important for @entity19 to do ? raising the debt ceiling to make sure the government has enough money to pay its debts delaying the date on which major provisions in the new health care law will take effect or are both equally important ?			1

@entity2 do n't think tying @entity11 to debt ceiling hike a good idea , @entity0 / @entity14 poll
@entity122 's ability to borrow more money to pay its bills expires in *mid-october*
survey indicates a majority of the public would blame @entity18 if debt ceiling not increased
