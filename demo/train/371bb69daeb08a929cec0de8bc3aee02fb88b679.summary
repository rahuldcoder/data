-- the lieutenant whose firefighters refused to leave their @entity5 fire station to help a 77 - year - old man who had collapsed outside has filed for retirement , a city official said friday			1
lt. @entity8 -- who commanded the station at the center of the incident -- filed papers on thursday to retire from the @entity5 's @entity14 and @entity13 , said @entity15 , a spokesman for @entity5 's deputy mayor for public safety			1
" it typically takes 45 - 50 days for such paperwork to be processed through channels , " @entity18 explained			0
@entity8 did not respond immediately to an e-mail thursday from @entity0 , and a call to a phone number listed for her was not answered			1
she took the step toward retirement five days after @entity28 held her elderly father in the street and screamed for help			2
a passerby rushed across the street to bang on the door of a fire station , knowing that firefighters are trained to provide emergency medical help			1
but they would n't leave the station			1
the same thing happened when two more people tried to summon the firefighters for assistance , according to @entity28			1
" we looked across the street at the fire station			1
there was a firefighter that was actually standing against the fire apparatus , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity48			1
" everybody started trying to wave him over			0
" but the firefighter said he had to be dispatched first			0
" i even ran to the curb and said , ' are you going to help me or let my dad die ? ' " said @entity28			0
later , after an ambulance finally arrived , @entity58 died at a hospital			0
he had suffered an apparent heart attack			0
authorities subsequently opened an investigation into the incident , though none challenged @entity28 ' version of events			0
" it 's an outrage , " @entity5 mayor @entity68 said at a news conference , who @entity5 news station @entity71 reports has apologized to @entity28			1
" i was absolutely furious			1
" according to the @entity28 family , those who asked for help at the fire station were told to call 911			1
calls to 911 were placed , but a mix - up with the address delayed an ambulance , said @entity83 member @entity82			2
" two things happened , " he said			2
" one was that no one came out of the fire house to help this gentleman			2
the other is the ambulance that was dispatched was dispatched to the wrong place			0
this was a number of fiascos			0
" @entity94 said thursday that two employees of the @entity14 and @entity96 were suspended with pay in the wake of the incident			0
the firefighters ' union said the incident simply should never have happened			1
" we need to find out why it did occur and make sure it never happens again , " said @entity103 , president of the @entity104 , in a statement reported by @entity71			0
the city 's deputy mayor for public safety , @entity109 , has said according to @entity71 that authorities will look at the communications and whether " protocols and procedures " were properly followed			1
there are no protocols that would prevent fire personnel from helping those in need , he told @entity0 thursday			1
" these are people who run into burning buildings			2
they work in the most hazardous conditions imaginable			0
" they cross the streets , they cross highways to get to people			2
this is why it is so troubling that we did not take the appropriate action in this case			0
it 's right across the street			2
" @entity0 's @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
