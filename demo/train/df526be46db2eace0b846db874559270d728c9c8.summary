@entity0 , @entity1 -- for much of this election season , i saw a lot to admire in @entity6			1
i liked the independence and courage he showed in going against the @entity11 establishment by challenging gov. @entity12 in the @entity14 race in @entity15			1
and when @entity6 was viciously and unfairly attacked by presumptuous white liberals for not being authentically @entity17 , i liked him even more			1
and now ? not so much			0
it 's all because of how @entity6 bungled his reaction to an @entity21 law that -- despite supporters ' assurances that it wo n't lead to racial and ethnic profiling -- is certain to lead to racial and ethnic profiling			1
in true @entity28 fashion , @entity6 was against the law before he was in favor of it			1
as the intelligent , charismatic and well - spoken son of @entity34 immigrants , @entity6 rose through the ranks quickly to become speaker of the @entity37 before taking on @entity12 for the @entity11 @entity14 nomination			1
@entity6 had not only vanquished @entity12 's nomination hopes but , in effect , ran him out of the party			1
the governor is now running for the @entity14 as an independent , against both @entity6 and presumptive @entity44 nominee @entity43			1
in fact , things were going smoothly for @entity6 until @entity47 passed a law intended to deputize state and local police officers to act as surrogate immigration agents			1
the idea behind @entity53 is to round up as many illegal immigrants as possible by requiring that police check the immigration status of people with whom they come in contact if officers have " reasonable suspicion " to believe that the person is the country illegally -- whether police want to or not			2
despite the fact that the law is enormously popular with the @entity11 base , @entity6 rightly opposed it as overly broad and flat - out dangerous			1
just a few weeks ago , he said in a statement : " @entity69 certainly have the right to enact policies to protect their citizens , but @entity21 's policy shows the difficulty and limitations of states trying to act piecemeal to solve what is a serious federal problem			1
from what i have read in news reports , i do have concerns about this legislation			0
while i do n't believe @entity21 's policy was based on anything other than trying to get a handle on our broken borders , i think aspects of the law , especially that dealing with ' reasonable suspicion , ' are going to put our law enforcement officers in an incredibly difficult position			1
it could also unreasonably single out people who are here legally , including many @entity95 citizens			0
throughout @entity95 history and throughout this administration we have seen that when government is given an inch it takes a mile			0
" @entity6 was right to be concerned			1
@entity53 is such a deeply flawed piece of legislation that it had to be amended a week after it was signed			2
supporters say the changes prevent racial and ethnic profiling			1
now , police officers can prowl for illegal immigrants only in the course of enforcing some other law or ordinance			2
in the original version , all that was required was " lawful contact			2
" another change is that now , the state attorney general or a county attorney can not investigate complaints based on a person 's race , color or national origin			0
the original law allowed for race , color and national origin to be considered as one of several factors and only prohibited law enforcement from focusing " solely " on those characteristics			0
that was good enough for @entity6 , who now says he backs the controversial law as amended			1
apparently , his concerns about racial profiling have been assuaged			1
trouble is , now i have concerns about @entity6			2
he ca n't be that gullible			0
so he must be in denial			0
the amendments are totally cosmetic			2
in the real world of policing , it 's impossible for law enforcement officers -- particularly those who lack the specialized training given to @entity147 agents -- to make assumptions about one 's legal status without taking race and ethnicity into account			2
we can tell them not to think about race and ethnicity , but that only makes them more likely to think about them			0
anyone who claims otherwise is dishonest , disingenuous or delusional			0
besides , there was an additional change in the law that arguably makes it even more dangerous and more divisive			0
now , the requirement that a police officer must determine the immigration status of an individual who they have a " reasonable suspicion " is in the country illegally extends to those instances where police respond to something as minor as city ordinance violations			0
that could include loud parties , barking dogs , cars on blocks , overcrowded apartments , etc. one can easily imagine neighbors turning in one another , and an environment that is already poisoned with resentment and fear becoming more so			0
supporters say they changed @entity53			0
they made it worse and more likely to lead to abuse			0
anyone who does n't see that must be blind			0
of course , ambition has been known to have that effect on people			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			2

@entity196 used to admire @entity6 , who challenged gov. @entity12 in @entity15 election
but , @entity196 says , @entity6 's flip - flop on @entity21 's immigration law changed his mind
@entity6 opposed the law as racial profiling , now backs amended version , @entity196 says
@entity196 says amendments are cosmetic at best ; @entity6 gullible or blinded by ambition
