the wife of an @entity2 pastor imprisoned in @entity3 pleaded with a @entity5 subcommittee on foreign affairs thursday to do something to free her husband			1
@entity9 said that her husband , @entity10 , went to @entity3 to build an orphanage but was imprisoned unjustly because of his @entity13 beliefs			1
she said that when her family 's " nightmare " began , she anticipated having to fight the @entity3 government			1
but she feels shocked and deeply disappointed because she 's had " to battle my own government			1
" @entity2 president @entity18 pushed for the release of @entity9 and two other detained @entity2 -- @entity20 and @entity21 -- when he spoke on the phone with @entity3 president @entity23 in september			1
@entity10 is a @entity2 citizen of @entity3 birth			1
in january , he was sentenced to eight years in prison , accused of attempting to undermine the @entity3 government and endangering national security by establishing home churches			1
he had converted to @entity13 from @entity28 and became a pastor in @entity30			0
he regularly made trips to @entity3 and was on a bus crossing from @entity33 into @entity3 in the summer of 2012 when immigration officials took away his passport			1

in late november , @entity44 spokeswoman @entity43 was asked why			0
she replied that the talks in @entity47 , @entity48 , concerning the deal were " focused exclusively on nuclear issues			1
" @entity9 told lawmakers thursday that when @entity2 and @entity3 officials met to discuss the nuclear deal , the @entity2 had a " perfect " opportunity to ask for the pastor 's release			1
" i feel my husband has been abandoned , " she said			2
@entity3 's detention and torture of her 33 - year - old husband constitutes an assault against @entity2 national security , she said			1
the detention is " an experiment " because officials there are " curious " to see how strong @entity18 is , and whether he would take action immediately to free the pastor			0
she held up a photo of herself and her two young children taken on their first day of school this year			0
she said that it was a heartbreaking moment to be without her husband and that as @entity74 approaches , she is praying for her husband and praying that her government realizes " how far we 've fallen " with negotiating with @entity3 without pushing more to secure her husband 's freedom			1

between 2000 and 2005 , her husband had previously gotten into trouble with @entity3 's government because he was talking about his @entity13 faith with @entity3 christians in their homes , she said			1
at that time , @entity3 was ruled under a different government			1
it did n't make sense to her , and she finds it outrageous , that her husband would be held now for offenses related to religion			2
" i am standing before you today because religious persecution is real , " @entity9 's statement read			1
" and until we stand up as one -- as @entity2 , as political leaders , and government officials , as people who have been endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights -- we will not truly embrace the responsibility that comes with that freedom			2

" at times he has awoken to find a knife - wielding prisoner standing over him at his bed			0
" her husband has been beaten so badly that he could not stand , she said , and suffered internal bleeding			2
nothing but the " @entity144 " kept him alive , she said			0

it sends prisoners to @entity134 to die			0
" a few months ago , the pastor was given medication and his condition improved , she wrote			0
a letter to the children @entity9 said her father showed her husband pictures of the couple 's two children when he visited him in prison			1
" @entity10 would just stare at the pictures the entire time for the few short minutes they were able to talk , " her statement says			0
once , her husband was able to compose a letter to his children			0
" it is so hard and so heart breaking for me to see these pictures and to know that i am not there beside you as you grow , " he wrote			0

" on the eve of her testimony , the pastor 's wife spoke to @entity187 's @entity186 about the pain her family has endured			0
" i think it 's the worst torture to see your kids suffering and not being able to do anything , " she said			0
" my hope is -- i know it might be too much , hoping too much -- is having him home by @entity74			0
... it will be a very difficult @entity74 scene ... " she said			0
