-- @entity1 has been in the news for helping police foil an alleged attempt to blackmail him , but the late - night star is hardly the first celebrity in this position			0
celebrities ranging from @entity9 to @entity10 have been victims in past extortion schemes here are a few brazen and mostly unsuccessful attempts to blackmail famous people			1
@entity14 @entity14 may be one of television 's most famous family men , but a 1997 extortion attempt tried to claim that his family was a bit bigger than anyone knew			1
that year , a 23 - year - old woman named @entity22 attempted to extort $ 40 million from @entity14 in exchange for not telling the press she was the star 's illegitimate daughter			1
while @entity14 admitted that he had an affair with @entity22 's mother and had given the woman and her daughter over $ 100,000 in support over the years , he flatly denied being @entity22 's father			1
@entity22 's timing probably did n't help , either ; @entity14 received her demand the same day @entity14 's son , @entity35 , was murdered			1
@entity22 , who was convicted along with two accomplices , received a 26 - month prison sentence			0
an appeals court briefly overturned the sentence in 1999 , but quickly reversed itself and sent her back to the clink			0

@entity45 the hefty comic became a target for blackmail after allegedly propositioning a man in a @entity50 casino in 1993			0
at the time , @entity45 was hosting " @entity53 " and starring in the cartoon " @entity52			0
" rather than take a hit to his public image , @entity45 shelled out $ 100,000 in hush money to his blackmailer , @entity58 , to keep the story out of the tabloids			0
@entity58 got greedy in 2000 , though			0
he came back to @entity45 for another $ 250,000 , at which point the comedian went to the cops			0
@entity58 ended up being arrested following a high - speed chase from the @entity65 , and he eventually went to prison for the extortion attempt			0
@entity9 a note to any aspiring actresses out there : if you 're planning on becoming famous , do n't pose for any nude photographs			2
in 1992 , the young model let photographer @entity74 take nude and bondage - themed snaps of her in the hopes of making an entry into the artistic modeling market			0
instead , @entity74 sat on the photos until @entity9 's 2003 film " @entity82 : @entity89 " was about to debut , at which point he made @entity9 an offer : she could buy the pictures for $ 3.5 million , or he would sell them to magazines			1
@entity74 claimed he had a signed release form from @entity9 that allowed him to sell the pictures if he so chose			1
rather than give in , though , @entity9 alerted the authorities			2
it turned out that @entity9 's " signature " was a forgery , and @entity74 was found guilty of attempted grand theft , forgery , and perjury			1
although @entity74 claimed that he was simply offering @entity9 the right of first refusal for the salacious pics , he ended up getting a three - year jail sentence			2

@entity10 @entity106 's @entity105 kept meticulous files on a lot of high - profile entertainers , including the @entity110			2
when @entity10 ' file found its way to the public , it revealed a number of blackmail attempts , including one particularly large case from when @entity10 was serving in the @entity118			1
when @entity10 was stationed in @entity119 in 1959 , he hired @entity121 doctor @entity120 to carry out a series of skin treatments on his famous face and shoulders			1
after a month , @entity10 and his entourage allegedly grew tired of @entity120 constantly making passes at them , so @entity10 fired the dermatologist			2
this angered the doctor , who then threatened to reveal compromising photographs and tapes of the rock star if @entity10 did n't open his wallet , according to @entity105 files			1
@entity10 held firm , though , and only gave @entity120 $ 200 for the skin treatments and a $ 315 plane ticket back to @entity139			1
the files also state that when @entity120 came back for thousands of dollars more , @entity10 refused , and the blackmailer -- who it turned out was n't actually a doctor after all -- eventually left the @entity110 alone			2
