-- it is 1987 , and a young @entity3 man is absolutely murdering a flamenco dance on the green at @entity7 's @entity6			2
around him , star names such as @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 are also partying like it 's 1999			1
and why not ? the @entity14 team has just tasted defeat on home soil for the first time in arguably golf 's most important event , the @entity20 -- a competition where a sport usually defined by its individualism becomes greater than the sum of its parts			1
" that ' 87 @entity20 really was very special for me and it made me realize how special the event was , and i fell in love with it straight away , " recalls said flamenco dancer @entity32 , who 25 years later captained a @entity34 team to another stunning @entity20 on @entity14 soil -- this time at @entity36 in @entity37			1
" the atmosphere is unique			0
you do n't have that sort of cheering in any other event in the whole world			0
you have two teams , the crowd are split in two , they will root for one of the teams			0
they are really loud , " he told @entity0 before the " miracle of @entity51 "			0
" if you look at @entity54 at the @entity20 we played ( in 2010 ) , standing at the first tee people were singing -- you do n't see that in any other event			1
and then you have the team members			0
the camaraderie in that week is unique			0
" the @entity20 is all about partnerships			1
for the first two days , each captain divides his teams into pairs which compete in a variety of 18 - hole match play competitions known as fourballs and foursomes			1
only on the final day of singles matches does it become one versus one , and even then the players will be in the unusual situation of cheering on their teammates			0
in his second season as a @entity77 professional , having already become the first @entity74 to win its top rookie award , @entity32 had the privilege of being paired with one of golf 's greatest icons for his @entity20 debut : @entity9			1
" i 'd heard about the @entity20 , but i never saw one , so i was just amazed at the atmosphere			1
i 'd never seen anything like that before in my life , " said @entity32 , who came from the small @entity85 town of @entity86 , where his family lived and worked on the local golf course			1
until 1977 , the @entity20 had always been @entity92 and @entity93 against the @entity94 helped change that , an exciting @entity3 talent who challenged golf 's long - established world order			1
he was a member of the first @entity34 team in 1979 and was a key figure in its breakthrough victory at @entity103 in @entity104 in 1985 , which was the first year the @entity14 did not win the title since 1957			1
in 1987 @entity9 began what became the most successful partnership in @entity20 history -- out of 15 matches together , he and @entity106 won 11 , halved two and lost two			1
" that week he took care of everything , " @entity32 said			1
" ( captain ) @entity113 did n't know what to do with me because i was a rookie			2
" what was he going to do with me -- i did n't have any experience of the @entity20 -- and all of a sudden @entity9 somehow took care of that			1
i think he approached @entity113 and said , ' do n't you worry , i 'll play with him			0
' " i remember walking from the putting green to the first tee on the first day of the match			2
i was really very , very nervous			0
he walked next to me and said , ' @entity32 you just play your game , and i 'll take care of the rest			1
' it was a great relief when i heard that			0
" @entity9 had spotted @entity32 as a future star several years earlier , even before he had won the @entity133 title in 1984			1
" i was at home , and i got a phone call asking me if i wanted to play in a charity match against @entity9 on his home course			1
first of all , i thought someone was pulling my leg or playing a joke , and i said , ' come on , it can not be true			0
' " it was true			0
i went there and i did n't know what to expect -- i knew @entity9 had won the ( @entity146 ) @entity145 ( in 1979 )			1
for a 15 - year - old to be paired with @entity9 -- in terrible conditions , i must say , it was pouring with rain -- i had the best time of my life			1
" that day was very special , and i think it contributed also to what happened in the future , me pairing with @entity9			1
we understood each other very well , and i think everything was born and happened that day			0
" read how the @entity34 team will honor @entity160 @entity32 grew up on @entity161 , which was developed from farmland			1
on the day it opened as a nine - hole course , his mother put in the flags for each green			2
the next day he was born			0
" when the landlord sold the land , he sold it under one condition -- that all the people who worked on the land would have a job on the golf course in some way shape or form , either as a greenkeeper or someone working on the clubhouse			2
that 's how my family got the job -- my father became a greenkeeper , and my mum and my grandmother were working in the clubhouse			2
" in the center of the course there is an old farmhouse where @entity32 grew up -- it is now converted into a caddy hut			2
" in those days , only wealthy people played , and they used to come at the weekends or holidays , " he recalled			0
" from mondays to fridays there was no one there , so i had the whole golf course for me			2
as soon as i could walk i was hitting balls			0
" @entity32 cemented his friendship with @entity9 , a man nine years his senior , when they played together in @entity14 events			1
" he had tough beginnings , the same scenario -- he had to play golf on the beach with a three iron , " @entity32 said			1
" i remember him telling me that when he was a caddy -- and he was quite a good player at that stage -- he had to sneak onto the golf course in the middle of the night with the full moon to play a few holes			2
" both began their professional careers in an @entity104 - speaking sporting world , without being able to speak much @entity104			2
" when i went to the @entity219 to play a few events , it was virtually him and i , " @entity32 said			2
" we were on our own , the only @entity3 players there , and we spent hours and hours on the golf course together , on the chipping area , having dinner -- he became a mentor for me			2
he prepared me for what was to come			0
he knew how difficult it was as a professional			0
" it was always a lot of fun with him			0
he always had stories to tell			0
he started playing professional golf at the age of 17 , he did n't speak a word of @entity104 and he started traveling all around the world very quickly			2
" like @entity9 , @entity32 went to the @entity219 and conquered the pinnacle of @entity14 golf -- the masters			1
like @entity9 , @entity32 donned the famous @entity240 at @entity241 not once , but twice			1
" i owe a lot to the masters and a lot to the @entity14			0
without my two masters i would n't be considered the player i am today , " he said			0
if his first triumph in 1994 was sweet , the second in 1999 represented an incredible victory over adversity after being stricken by rheumatoid polyarthritis in both feet			0
" i could n't walk for two years , i had to watch golf on the tv , i had to watch my peers making birdies			0
it was one of the toughest moments of my life , " @entity32 said			2
" before , i took golf for granted , and all of a sudden you see all those things vanishing			0
fortunately enough , i came out of it and was healthy again , and that made me appreciate much more what i have -- everyday life , waking up without pain , being able to do things , enjoying the family and the moment that you 're in			0
" while he enjoyed success in the masters , later in 1999 @entity32 suffered @entity20 heartache when he halved a controversial decisive match with @entity275 as the @entity14 won the infamous " @entity276			1
" he would not play for @entity34 again until 2006 , the year after the last of his 31 professional victories , but his final appearance as a @entity20 player was a winning one , as he forged another strong partnership with another @entity74 , @entity281 -- one of the veterans of the current team			1
having been inducted into golf 's @entity284 in 2009 , @entity32 was called up as a vice-captain by @entity287 during @entity34 's 2010 victory in @entity289 , and was a popular choice to take the helm for this year 's event			1
@entity160 wins amateur @entity145 " nothing compares to standing on that first tee , playing the course			0
being the captain is the best i can do at the moment			0
there is always a start and finish to everything , " @entity32 said			2
this @entity20 was the first to be played since the death of @entity9 , who passed away at the age of 54 in may 2011 following a long battle with brain cancer			1
" the good thing about most of the players in the team is they knew @entity9 , " @entity32 said			1
" they got a call at @entity54 from the man himself			0
it meant a lot to them , so hopefully those memories will be there with the players			0
" he was the one who started to change things -- he made us believe that we could win , and hopefully he will be present there			0
