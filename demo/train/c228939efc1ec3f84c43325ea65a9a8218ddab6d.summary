perhaps you 've come across a recipe or two on @entity2 for perfect skin			1
we 've seen them too : banana and orange facials , spicy acne masks , olive oil cleansers and more			1
but whether you 're holistically - minded , frustrated with drugstore finds or having a beauty emergency , it 's not always wise to experiment on your face with that thing you saw on the @entity15			0
we wondered , should you ever put your skin and hair at the mercy of your kitchen pantry ? " for the most part i prefer drug store or department store or cosmeceutical products from your dermatologist because they 're actually tested on the skin and they go through certain quality control measures , " said @entity21 dermatologist dr. @entity20			1
" but in a pinch , there are things you can use at home			0
" you just have to pick carefully and learn a little bit from the past			0
people have been using substances like olive oil , yogurt , vinegar , honey and aloe for skin care for ages , @entity46 said , and now there are scientific studies that explain why they work			1
we asked day , who has a few @entity52 recipes of her own in her book , " @entity55 , " to guide us through the " dos and don'ts " of homemade beauty treatments			0
think different here are some of @entity46 's favorite pantry beauty ingredients			1
@entity61 of @entity46 's go - to products is honey			1
" honey is published widely in medical literature for its use on wounds and diabetic sores , " she said			1
it is antiseptic and creates a barrier on wounds that 's breathable , like skin , she said			1
honey also helps preserve homemade salves , so you can use them for more than one application			1
she includes honey in her recipes for acne treatment , eye de-puffing and exfoliating scrubs			1
it 's excellent for treating eczema , she said			0
@entity86 , like honey , is great for treating wounds , @entity46 said , and other skin irritations			1
it is anti-inflammatory , she said , so it 's great for the pain associated with burns and poison ivy			1
just pop off a piece of an aloe house plant and rub it directly on your irritated skin , she said			1
" but it can sting when you first put it on the skin , so you have to be a little patient that way , " she said			2
@entity107 oil and coconut oil are @entity46 's favorites for home hydration			1
they are gentle on the skin , she said , and good for treating irritation			2
a little bit of these oils massaged gently around the eyes can help hydrate wrinkly skin under the eyes , but take care not to get it in your eyes , she said			2
olive oil can even be used to effectively clean oily skin -- and is often used as a binder for sugar or salt scrubs			1
for silky , shiny , smooth hair , @entity46 recommends putting coconut oil in your hair , letting it soak in for a bit , then massaging in some shampoo before rinsing			1
if you shampoo after you 've got water on your oil - soaked hair , it will be greasy for days , she said			2
@entity138 and sugar are excellent exfoliants , @entity46 said			1
baking soda , as well , can be used as a fine - grained exfoliant , and may have antiseptic and brightening qualities as well , @entity46 said			1
it 's simple to add salt , sugar or baking soda to any cleanser you already have and make it a scrub			1
dissolved epsom salts can also exfoliate the skin when used in high concentration			2
" @entity157 salts are an all - purpose type of thing , " she said			0
" depending on the concentration , you can use it for everything from cleaning your furniture to get the calluses off your feet to help soothe your skin			2
" it can help dry out a poison ivy rash if you use a small amount of @entity157 salt in a bath , she said			0
teaif you want to get antioxidants on your skin , use tea , rather than the often - suggested berries , @entity46 said			1
" you can put blueberries on your face , but that will just stain your skin and probably you wo n't get enough of the blueberry 's antioxidant effect to make a difference , " she said			2
steeped tea bags can effectively de-puff your eyes by themselves or strongly brewed tea can add antioxidant treatment to cucumber slices			2
" white tea has the highest levels of antioxidants and caffeine , so that would be my preferred one for the face , " she said			2
@entity52 facial treatment recipes use milk for wrinkle - banishing properties , but @entity46 said it 's silly			1
milk can actually spoil on your skin , and it 's not strong enough to deliver any lactic acid , she said			2
" it wo n't work , " she said , " and it 's expensive			0
" instead , @entity46 said , reach for the yogurt			1
in a mask , yogurt can deliver enough lactic acid to actually treat certain skin conditions			2
think twice here are some ingredients days says to approach with caution , or consider other options			0
vinegarplain old white vinegar has historically been used as a deodorant , and it does stop body odor , @entity46 said			1
but it has a major drawback : it stinks			0
" it 's killing the yeast and certain bacteria , " that can make you smell bad , she said , " but then you smell like vinegar			0
" adding essential oil to vinegar helps , but does not eliminate the salad smell entirely , she said			2
as for making your hair shiny -- another often - suggested use -- " it might have an effect on the hair cuticle , closing it , " she said , " but i do n't know that i would use it in the hair			0
" after all , coconut oil works better , she said			2
@entity234 whites can provide a temporary tightening effect , a little relief for oily skin , @entity46 said			1
but they come with a risk			0
" you have to be careful with the egg white mask because egg whites sometimes have salmonella , and if you end up ingesting it by accident , you can actually get salmonella , " she said			0
" so these days , unless you know the source of the eggs , i would be very careful with that one			0
" spicesif a @entity52 facial scrub recipe calls for cinnamon , use it at your own risk , @entity46 said			1
" i think that would be irritating			0
you would n't get enough of a concentration of cinnamon and you can probably even get blisters , " she said			0
" it 's a spice			0
if you put pepper on your skin , you can burn your skin			2
" but your skin can benefit from spices in your food , she said			1
@entity268 is anti-inflammatory , she said , and she often suggests adding it to meals			0
" but it will stain your skin orange and you wo n't get enough absorption from using it on your skin to get the benefit , " she said			2
" over-the - counter products that contain turmeric use turmeric extract , and those are better on the skin			1
" @entity283 fruits , like lemons , can irritate skin , @entity46 said			1
so if you 're looking at a beauty recipe that calls for rubbing orange juice on your face or lemon wedges on your lips , stop reading			0
( lips do n't have oil glands , so they 're especially sensitive , " day said			0
) " lemons have a chemical called psoralen , and the psoralen makes you exquisitely sensitive to light			0
it activates in about 10 to 15 minutes , and it takes about 24 hours to wear off			0
so if you do that , and go out in the sun , you can actually blister , " @entity46 said			1
" i see it on people at the beach if they 're having a @entity306 or a margarita , " she said			0
" because they squeeze the lemon and get a rash on the back of their hand			0
it 's the splatter pattern of how they squeezed the lemon , and the sunburn effect			0
" @entity319 lemons , peroxide is often suggested as a home remedy for lightening hair color			0
but @entity46 warns against it			1
" it can bleach , but it can irritate , " she said			0
" peroxide is toxic to skin cells			0
so if you have a wound and you keep putting hydrogen peroxide on it , it wo n't heal			0
" only use it on the first day of your injury to clean a cut or a wound , she advised .			0
