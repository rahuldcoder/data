@entity0 -- could former @entity4 contractor @entity2 be part of a new prisoner swap ? two @entity7 convicted of spying in the @entity8 are pushing for the deal			1
they argue that @entity8 president @entity10 could follow the release of @entity13 sgt. @entity12 with a similar exchange , swapping three of their imprisoned colleagues in exchange for @entity2			1
" the only thing missing is political will , " @entity19 told reporters tuesday , speaking from @entity21 in a teleconference broadcast at the @entity23 in @entity0			2
" i can not think of a reason for him not to do something similar to what he did ( with @entity12 )			2
" @entity2 , 65 , is serving a 15 - year sentence for bringing satellite communications equipment to @entity7 as part of his work as a subcontractor for the @entity36			1
he was convicted in march 2011			0
@entity19 is one of the " @entity37 , " a group of @entity23 agents who were arrested in @entity40 in 1998 and convicted of espionage in 2001			2
two of them -- @entity19 and @entity43 -- were released from prison and have returned to @entity7			2
@entity37 , @entity37 and @entity37 remain in prison in the @entity8			2
since their conviction , the agents have been the focus of an international campaign by the @entity23 government to have them freed			2
both of the freed agents have joined the lobbying effort			0
the pair already say the @entity12 exchange shows a deal is possible , despite the criticism @entity10 has faced since the controversial swap of the @entity8 soldier for five @entity61 figures who 'd been detained at @entity63			1
" i think this is the time to do it			0
i think we had never had a more favorable moment to go that route than we have now			0
i think that the end result would have an important and positive impact , not only on us , but also on future generations , " @entity43 said during tuesday 's teleconference			0
but @entity4 officials have stressed that @entity12 's case is different , given that he was a member of the @entity8 armed forces who was captured in the midst of a military conflict			1
however , @entity4 officials say they are taking steps to ensure that @entity2 is returned to the @entity8			1
" @entity2 is an international development worker , and his situation is not comparable in any way to those of the convicted @entity23 intelligence agents			1
the @entity23 intelligence agents were tried transparently under due process rights that we extend to all defendants in our judicial system , " a @entity4 spokesman said in an e-mail to @entity1			0
" @entity23 government interlocutors frequently attempt to compare mr. gross ' imprisonment to that of five convicted @entity23 intelligence agents , three of whom continue to serve sentences in the @entity8			1
" @entity8 officials said @entity2 was merely trying to help @entity7 bypass the island 's stringent restrictions on internet access			1
but @entity23 authorities say @entity2 was part of a plot to create " a @entity23 spring " and destabilize the island 's single - party communist government			1
@entity8 federal prosecutors called the " @entity37 " a dangerous undercover spy cell			0
the @entity23 government said they were gathering intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks against @entity7			1
the apparent @entity8 reluctance to pursue a swap has n't stopped the @entity23 government from pushing for it and saying that it would be open to discussing the matter with the @entity8			1
" we are not talking about an exchange , we are talking about unilateral decisions which , obviously , would have to be interrelated , " said @entity23 ambassador @entity116			0
" the @entity8 government has called on us to discuss humanitarian concerns			0
we , too , have a number of humanitarian concerns			0
we have said repeatedly that we are willing to seek a solution			0
" @entity1 's @entity125 and @entity126 contributed to this report .			0

@entity7 say the release of sgt. @entity12 shows a prisoner swap is possible
they say former @entity36 contractor @entity2 could be next
@entity23 authorities want the @entity8 to swap @entity2 for three imprisoned @entity23 spies
