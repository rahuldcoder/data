it 's called @entity2 's law			0
the longer a debate rages , the greater the likelihood that someone will compare someone else to @entity7			2
and @entity8 has done just that : on tuesday the former secretary of state reportedly told a private fund - raising party that @entity14 president @entity13 's actions are similar to @entity7 's in the run up to @entity15 her quote ( according to the @entity17 ) : " all the @entity18 that were ... the ethnic @entity18 , the @entity18 by ancestry who were in places like @entity22 and @entity23 and other places , @entity7 kept saying they 're not being treated right			1
i must go and protect my people , and that 's what 's gotten everybody so nervous			0
" of course , what also gets everybody " so nervous " is leading statesmen comparing @entity13 to @entity7 and , thereby , raising the specter of another world war			1
it 's unlikely that @entity35 intended to gain politically from these remarks -- and they were carefully qualified			0
she added that " there is no indication that @entity13 is as irrational " as the @entity18 dictator was			2
but they could indicate that if she wins the 2016 election , @entity43 might gain a slightly more forceful president in foreign affairs , someone more willing to engage directly in @entity49 than @entity50 has			2
you may recall that in the 2008 primaries she was the @entity54 ' hawk candidate -- so much so that @entity55 preferred her to @entity56 ( @entity57 called her " our girl " )			0
but was @entity35 right ? mostly no. it is true that @entity13 's justification for intervention in @entity63 is similar to @entity7 's , that is , threatening to invade a sovereign territory to defend his ethnic brethren			1
but the situation is complex , and the historical comparison is tenuous at best			0
opinion : has @entity13 broken international law ? after all , in the eyes of many ethnic @entity14 , it is the @entity63 nationalists -- not @entity13 -- who are the @entity73			1
the @entity14 have asserted , quite accurately , that the revolution that overthrew a @entity76 , democratically elected leader has resulted in the elevation of @entity79 fascists into key government positions			0
for example , the new secretary of the @entity82 is @entity84 -- co-founder of the @entity85 of @entity63 ( @entity86 )			0
another creator of the @entity86 is @entity88 , a high - profile leader of the @entity90 protests who has blamed @entity63 's problems on a @entity94 conspiracy run out of @entity95			1
@entity63 's new deputy secretary of national security is @entity98 , leader of the @entity100 group , which regards @entity88 as a soft liberal and which flies the old flag of the @entity63 @entity104 collaborators at its rallies			1
in other words , in this situation , who exactly are the @entity73 ? @entity13 's ethnic @entity14 nationalists ? or the fringe of the ethnic @entity63 nationalists ? neither is particularly pleasant			1
of course , the @entity63 @entity104 movement is small , and @entity63 is dwarfed by @entity14 , which puts @entity13 in the role of the dominant regional power picking on a small country and exploiting its extremist politics for the purpose of propaganda			1
but @entity13 is still no @entity7 , because he lacks the @entity18 @entity121 's global vision			1
opinion : @entity13 2014 vs. @entity123 @entity7 worked by an all - encompassing racist ideology that dreamed of turning @entity49 into a giant living space for his people			1
@entity13 -- the leader of a democracy , albeit a highly corrupt and politically stagnant one -- simply meddles in the affairs of countries that could reasonably be said to fall within his country 's historical sphere of influence			2
@entity63 was a part of the @entity133 until two decades ago ( whereas @entity135 was part of @entity14 until 1954 ) , the country contains millions of ethnic @entity14 and , crucially , it has @entity14 military installations that are key to @entity14 's strategic interests			2
in other words , a @entity14 invasion of @entity63 is not going to be a stepping stone to the invasion of @entity143			2
unfortunately , it may well be a stepping stone to involvement in the affairs of the @entity148 -- which are firmly in @entity149 and the @entity150			1
this is why @entity13 's latest ambitions have to be checked			1
nevertheless , calling @entity7 is careless			0
as @entity154 points out in the @entity155 , it 's historically insensitive and ignores the tapestry of cultural clashes and political calculations going on			0
it smacks , too , of the @entity161 division of the world between good and evil that permeated the war on terror and led to so many terrible mistakes and so many @entity43 deaths overseas			0
worse , still , is that such provocative language should be applied to a confrontation with a state like @entity14			0
we are dealing with a major power with nuclear weapons that has the capacity to reduce the world to so much irradiated ash			0
the @entity177 needs to be careful with its words .			0

@entity181 : @entity8 compared @entity13 's @entity63 moves to @entity7 's in 1930s
he says the comment was ill - considered ; @entity13 's justification is similar , but not much else
he says @entity63 nationalists are more @entity104 - like , and @entity13 not *planning* @entity49 invasion
@entity181 : if @entity13 eyeing @entity148 states , which are in @entity149 , @entity150 , his ambition must be checked
