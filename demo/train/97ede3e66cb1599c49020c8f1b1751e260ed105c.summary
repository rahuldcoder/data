@entity0 -- @entity2 , a longtime @entity1 national correspondent , passed away thursday at his @entity0 home at the age of 83			1
@entity2 's broadcast career stretched across 40 years , first at @entity6 , where he hosted the " @entity7 " among other things , then at @entity1 , where he was chief national correspondent before retiring in 2006			1
after his last report for @entity1 , anchor @entity9 paid tribute to @entity2 by saying , " one of our colleagues likes to say that if there were a journalist hall of fame , @entity2 certainly would be in it			1
" below is @entity19 bureau chief and senior vice president @entity21 's note to the bureau on @entity2 's passing : ... i have sad news to report about a beloved member of the @entity1 family			1
our long - time national correspondent , @entity2 , passed away on thursday			1
all of us who worked with @entity2 knew him to be a reporter 's reporter ; a man who cared deeply about journalism , politics and people			1
@entity2 could tell a story like no other , as he effortlessly weaved facts , emotion and history into every one of his news stories			1
a story about a @entity44 race might be full of references to @entity46 , @entity47 , or even @entity48			0
@entity2 understood the importance of historical context			2
without exception each of his stories was unique and brilliantly written			0
simply put , @entity2 was a modern day news poet			1
hear @entity2 remember the legacy of @entity54 politics was @entity2 's specialty and he keenly understood that the actions of a lawmaker or a candidate could have profound consequences that might ripple across @entity61 , across the @entity62			1
he attended virtually every political convention from 1960 through 2004			0
he was a @entity64 correspondent from 1964 - 1993 , and a @entity1 correspondent from 1993 - 2006			2
while at @entity6 , beyond covering campaigns , he reported on everything from @entity68 to the deaths of @entity70 and @entity71 to @entity72			2
at @entity1 , @entity2 was not only our national correspondent , but he also delivered a weekly essay " @entity76 " on our sunday program , " @entity78			1
" that essay , in my opinion , was often the most brilliant two minutes on @entity61 television each week			0
he retired with shelves of @entity83 , a @entity84 , and a @entity85			0
@entity2 was an original member of the famed " @entity86 , " and could share campaign trail war stories with his colleagues and our viewers like nobody else			2
his daughter , @entity91 , told me that working and covering politics for @entity1 was one of @entity2 's great loves			1
i have missed @entity2 's voice on our air these last few years			1
now i 'll miss his emails and his remarkable blog postings , which he updated often			0
@entity99 / a few days ago , he wrote this about the midterm elections : we have off - year elections this year			0
that means elections for the @entity44 -- a third of its hundred seats up for six year terms and all of the @entity110 's 435 seats , for two year terms			0
the @entity0 wo n't vote ; we have no representation in the @entity113			2
in a lot of districts the issues will be local -- a bridge , an allegedly crooked pol. it will be harder , i think , for @entity121 to make president @entity123 's person or policies be issues because he and they have been moderate			0
i can remember when public anger was so strong here -- during the @entity128 or the @entity130 impeachment -- when perfect strangers would yell on the street at those of us who covered the news			0
there 's none of that now			0
it looks like a clean battle for november , followed by the big shootout two years later			0
when @entity2 retired from @entity1 in 2006 , @entity9 ended his @entity142 broadcast by saying , " @entity2 brings something very special to television journalism , a truly unique voice , smart and wry , with a perspective you could only get by covering politics for five decades			1
" " one of our colleagues likes to say that if there were a journalist hall of fame , @entity2 would certainly be in it , " @entity9 said			2
@entity2 -- rest in peace dear friend			2
your words and wisdom will be missed			0
@entity21 people we 've lost in 2014			0
