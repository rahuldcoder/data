@entity0 -- a mystery portrait donated to a @entity4 heritage charity as part of a mixed lot of paintings has been identified as a work by @entity10 master @entity9 -- worth more than $ 30 million			1
the picture , dated 1635 , shows the then 29 - year - old artist in a black velvet cape and hat decorated with outsized ostrich feathers			1
it was given to the @entity17 in 2010 , along with four other artworks			1
at the time it was thought to have been painted by one of @entity9 's pupils , but new tests and research by leading @entity9 scholar @entity24 have shown it is more likely to be by the teacher himself			1
" over the years , it has gone back and forward , " @entity28 , the @entity17 's curator of paintings and sculpture , told @entity1			2
" decades ago it was thought to be a @entity9 , and then the experts said no , that it was by someone in his studio instead			0
" @entity35 , chairman of the @entity36 , said the painting was last examined in 1968 , and that in the intervening years " we have gathered far more knowledge about @entity9 's self - portraits and the fluctuations in his style			1
" he said that x-ray analysis , along with " newly found circumstantial evidence remarkably increased the likelihood that the painting was by @entity9 himself , " and that a recent close look at the picture had confirmed those suspicions			2
the painting was given to the @entity17 by the estate of @entity53 , @entity54 of @entity55 , whose late husband @entity56 , lord @entity56 was a keen art collector and philanthropist			2
" it was part of a very generous gift , of five top - notch paintings , " @entity28 explained			0
as well as the @entity9 portrait , the donation also included two peasant scenes and two maritime scenes			2
but while the @entity17 recognized that the portrait was a high - quality work , it was not put on display at @entity69 , in @entity70 , southwest @entity71 , immediately			1
" it was in storage at first , " explained @entity28			0
" @entity75 not because it was unloved , more because we were waiting for the right place for it -- we wanted to get the display right			0
" " it 's amazing to think we might have had an actual @entity9 hanging here on the walls at @entity69 for the past couple of years , " @entity79 , property manager at @entity69 , said in a statement			1
" we never dared think that it might actually be an original , and many of our visitors will have just passed by it , in what is sure to be a real contrast to the attention it is now going to receive			0
" the self - portrait , the only @entity9 in the @entity17 's huge collection of 13,500 paintings , will remain on display at @entity69 until the end of the tourist season -- where it is expected to attract plenty of visitors -- and will then be sent for further tests to help confirm its new identity			1
" it will undergo a full clean , and technical analysis , " said @entity28			0
" it is painted on a beech panel , so dendrochronology [ tree ring dating ] will allow us to date the panel , and it will be x-rayed to check for under - drawings			0
" the paint will be analyzed , so we can see if the pigments match those used by @entity9 , and when it comes back to us in the new year , we should have the final confirmation			0
" @entity120 : 1990 art heist cracked			0

painting was donated to the @entity17 in 2010 , and put on display at @entity69
work was originally identified as being by a *follower* of @entity10 master @entity9
new tests *reveal* the portrait , which shows @entity9 at the age of 29 , is by the artist himself
*re-attribution* means the painting is now worth more than $ 30 million -- but it can not be sold
