in the arts , " @entity25 " by @entity26 won for fiction , " @entity27 : the @entity29 of @entity30 from the @entity31 to @entity32 " by @entity33 won in the general nonfiction category , and " @entity8 : @entity9 in the @entity10 " by @entity6 won for the category of biography			2
among the winners in journalism categories were the @entity40 ( @entity39 ) @entity38 for public service , the @entity44 ( @entity45 ) @entity43 's @entity42 for editorial cartooning and columnist @entity47 of the @entity48 for commentary			2
for the first time , all 14 @entity2 journalism categories were open for competition from news organizations that publish only on the @entity54			1
entirely online entries were previously permitted in only two categories : breaking news coverage and breaking news photography since 2006 , online content from newspaper web sites had been permitted in all @entity2 journalism categories , but online - only newspapers were not allowed to submit entries			1
despite the opportunity , there were no winners from online only news sites			1
web sites for print magazines and broadcast outlets are not eligible to enter , said @entity71 , administrator of the @entity2			1
@entity72 , deputy director for the @entity74 's @entity73 , said that allowing online - only publications to apply for the prestigious award is recognition of the growing importance of online media			1
" much of [ media ] comes from traditional press , but a lot is coming from non-traditional press as well , and that needs to be recognized along with what 's being produced in traditional media , " she said			0
" we 've clearly hit a point now where we 've seen the audience migration to the @entity90 accelerate			0
" @entity91 said a survey of online journalists conducted by the @entity73 found some concerns about the possibility of online reporting changing the fundamental values of journalism			1
those surveyed cited issues like a focus on speed and loss of accuracy as possible issues that could arise with journalism on the @entity90			2
but with those concerns , @entity91 said , comes the opportunity to tell stories in a multidimensional way			0
" we see some tremendous reporting that could not exist in former modes of communication , " she said , observing that media platforms such as text , photo galleries and video can not only be connected but be used to connect journalists to @entity54 users and internet users to each other			0
" those are tremendous changes , " she said			0
@entity123 , the @entity125 distinguished visiting professor of journalism at @entity126 in @entity127 , said the core values of accuracy and fairness have to be honored , no matter the method of reporting			0
still , @entity123 said , further opening the @entity2 to online publications " gives further weight to the role that digital journalism plays in this era			1
" " in some ways , it 's increased legitimacy for new forms of delivering journalism , " @entity123 said			0
" it also heightens the discussion about the distinction between basic information and substantive journalism			0
just because somebody throws something online does n't mean it is journalism			1
" @entity151 , editor of @entity152 , said his site did not apply for the @entity154 despite what he believes was his publication 's exceptional political , technology and business coverage			1
" we are not a hard - news site , and we do n't do the kinds of stories and projects that have traditionally been awarded , " @entity151 said			1
@entity151 said the recognition for online journalism is more than warranted			1
" it 's an overdue acknowledgement that some of the best journalism in the world and in @entity170 is being created not for print publication but for places that live entirely on the @entity90 , " he said			1
" there 's so much of it that does n't ever get into a print publication and yet is as important to shaping the debate and to changing how people think about things as to anything you might read in one of our great newspapers or magazines			0
" @entity2 for journalism were also awarded to the following : @entity187 and @entity188 of the @entity189 ( @entity45 ) @entity3 for explanatory reporting ; the @entity191 ( @entity192 ) free press staff , and notably @entity194 and @entity195 and @entity196 and @entity197 of the @entity199 ( @entity198 ) @entity43 for local reporting ; and the staff of the @entity202 ( @entity203 ) @entity3 for national reporting			2
