-- a good soldier never publicly contradicts the commander in chief , at least not intentionally , and defense secretary @entity3 is a good soldier			2
a @entity6 veteran , @entity4 provided a robust defense of president @entity9 's approach to @entity11 jihadists in @entity12 and @entity13 when interviewed wednesday by @entity0 national security correspondent @entity14			1
with @entity9 facing criticism over what even a fellow @entity16 called too much caution , @entity4 sought to make clear that the president wants to eliminate any @entity11 threat to the @entity21 and its interests -- both abroad and at home			2
' degrade and destroy ' " we 're providing the president with those options to degrade and destroy " the ability of the group that calls itself the @entity30 to attack @entity21 anywhere in the world , he said			0
when @entity14 pressed for clarity on @entity9 's statement earlier wednesday , asking if the president meant containment , @entity4 sough to clarify what his boss said			1
asked whether @entity9 meant " containment " when he said earlier wednesday that the goal was to manage the @entity11 threat , @entity4 said , " no , it 's not contain			2
" " it 's exactly what the president said : degrade and destroy			0
" why it took @entity9 so long to address his no @entity11 strategy comments and so it went for an hour of questions from @entity14 and some in the audience at the @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54			1
@entity4 repeatedly expressed agreement with @entity9 's positions on @entity13 and @entity57 , where the international community has said @entity60 troops have crossed the border to help @entity63 separatists fighting the @entity57 military			1
asked if @entity9 tipped his hand by rejecting a @entity21 ground invasion against @entity11 three years after bringing home combat forces from @entity12 , @entity4 said , " we 're not going to go back into @entity12 the same way we came out of @entity12 a few years ago			1
" @entity71 's warning to @entity11 : ' we will follow them to the gates of hell ' instead , he advocated @entity9 's broad - based strategy that calls for a new and more inclusive @entity12 government , an international coalition supporting it and limited @entity21 military action like the airstrikes launched last month at @entity11 targets in the north			1
" there 's no question in my mind " that the @entity9 administration approached the @entity11 issue with a " sense of urgency , " @entity4 said , adding that possible airstrikes on the jihadists ' positions in @entity13 were among the options the @entity84 has presented to the president for further steps			1
what can the @entity21 do against @entity11 in @entity13 -- and could it work ? on the @entity57 conflict , @entity4 sounded a similar theme			1
if @entity60 president @entity98 continued to escalate the fighting there , he would face further consequences on top of @entity21 and @entity103 sanctions imposed so far , but " we 're not going to get into a military engagement , a war , over this with @entity60 , " @entity4 said			2
' sick to your stomach ' the @entity11 issue dominated the hour - long interview			0
@entity4 said the videotaped beheadings of two @entity21 journalists by the @entity119 jihadists " makes you sick to your stomach , but it again reminds you of the brutality and barbarism that is afoot in some places in the world			0
" " it wo n't just recede into the gray recesses of history until we stop it , " he said			0
at one point , @entity4 misspoke about the number of @entity21 believed fighting with @entity11			0
" as we have acknowledged publicly , we are aware of over 100 @entity21 citizens who have @entity21 passports who are fighting in the @entity135 with @entity11 forces , " he said , referring to the group by another acronym for the @entity119 jihadists used by some @entity21 officials			0
" there may be more -- we do n't know			0
" the @entity84 later told @entity14 that @entity4 's figure referred to the total number of @entity21 believed fighting in @entity13 with various groups , not just @entity11			1
about a dozen @entity21 are thought to be with @entity11			0
