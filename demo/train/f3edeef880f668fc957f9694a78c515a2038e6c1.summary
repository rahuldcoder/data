-- the apparent suicide of @entity2 , the nurse who inadvertently put through a prank call to the hospital ward where the @entity6 was staying , has provoked outrage , sadness and demands for retribution in all corners of the media			1
the tragedy has revived memories of previous practical jokes that have gone horribly wrong , but also stirred an already febrile debate on ethical boundaries , whether in the mainstream or social media , and what , if any , legal recourse should be available to people humiliated or taunted in public			1
@entity24 , a 46 - year - old mother of two , was found dead friday -- three days after @entity27 djs @entity25 and @entity28 of @entity29 placed a call to the king edward vii hospital in the @entity32 , where the duchess was being treated for morning sickness			1
they pretended to be @entity36 and prince @entity37			1
a statement on the radio station 's website said : " the hosts have decided that they will not return to their radio show until further notice out of respect for what can only be described as a tragedy			1
" @entity46 , ceo of the company that owns the radio station , said saturday the @entity26 were " deeply shattered " by what occurred			1
" this is a tragic event that could not have been reasonably foreseen and we are deeply saddened by it , " he said of @entity24 's death			1
many media organizations played the audio tape of the prank call in part or its entirety			1
@entity0 broadcast part of it -- but not the segment where a nurse in the ward briefly discussed details of the duchess 's condition			1
of the three major broadcasters in the @entity32 , neither @entity68 nor the @entity69 played the call			1
@entity71 played a clip that included the voice of @entity24 ( but did not identify her ) on several newscasts			2
it did n't really matter whether the major broadcasters aired the tape ; the whole conversation was widely available online via @entity80			2
nurse found dead after taking prank call before @entity24 's apparent suicide , the chief executive of the hospital , @entity83 , had already condemned the prank , saying , " i think this whole thing is pretty deplorable , our nurses are caring , professional people trained to look after patients , not to cope with journalistic trickery of this sort			1
" and trickery seems to go the heart of the issue			2
@entity29 has a history of public humiliation			2
in 2009 , a 14 - year - old girl was tricked into acknowledging that she had been raped at the age of 12 -- only to be asked by a dj : " is that the only experience you 've had ? " that led the @entity104 to censure the station -- saying the broadcast did not meet standards of decency			2
the station said it had provided the teenager with counseling and vowed " to prevent anything similar from happening again			2
" but @entity29 has been the subject of several inquiries since ; and this year was told it " must not broadcast material that demeans or is likely to demean women or girls " as a condition of keeping its license			2
that followed a broadcast in which a female journalist was called a derogatory term and told " to watch your mouth or i 'll hunt you down " by @entity26 @entity127			1
the incident provoked a campaign to persuade advertisers to boycott the show , but @entity29 was not fined and @entity127 kept his job			2
he even interviewed @entity27 prime minister @entity133 in july			1
social media entwined in radio prank after its latest prank , @entity29 's website boasted about the " @entity138 , " but in the @entity32 , @entity140 columnist @entity139 said it was " not so funny to hear two grown adults call up a hospital ward full of sick people to try to scam information about one of them			1
" " @entity146 and @entity25 did was borderline illegal , " she added			2
on social media , the tragedy made an impact in a way that many stories do n't			2
" @entity153 created by 24/7 news means few news items actually cause shock ; the death of nurse @entity2 is one such item , " tweeted @entity152			1
it also prompted visceral hostility toward the radio presenters			1
' i hope they 're proud of themselves ' ...			2
" do the moronic callers still find themselves humorous ? " ...			2
" humanity , we have reached another low " were among the thousands of furious tweets			2
both djs have deleted their @entity171 accounts			1
as the @entity32 tabloid the @entity172 put it on its front - page saturday , ' @entity176			1
' around the world , reaction in the op - ed columns echoed the fury			2
in @entity182 , @entity181 wrote : " so a young woman who cared enough to go into nursing , was courteous enough to pick up a phone because a receptionist was n't at her desk , was trusting enough to be helpful -- is dead			1
two children do n't have a mother			1
" but at least a radio station kept their audience entertained			1
" however , some -- a minority to be sure -- said it was too easy to mobilize the virtual lynch mob			2
one @entity182 tweeted : " the two deejays are not responsible for the actions of an unbalanced woman			0
" prank phone calls and other practical jokes have long been a form of entertainment on radio and television			1
most of the time they are harmless enough : both sides get the joke			0
the tv series " @entity210 " ran for years because the great majority of the people tricked by the show were prepared to sign away their dignity for a few minutes			0
but pranks can go wrong			0
back in 2008 , the @entity69 apologized to actor @entity216 after two radio presenters -- @entity218 and @entity219 -- left a series of messages on his phone while on - air , including offensive references to his granddaughter			1
the second message apologized for the first -- but also suggested @entity226 might kill himself because of the content of the previous message			0
the two presenters were later suspended by the @entity69 , and a senior executive resigned			0
the corporation was also fined some $ 225,000 by the @entity32 media regulator and its governing trust described the episode as a " deplorable intrusion with no editorial justification			1
" @entity218 moved on -- to a career in @entity239			0
veteran publicist @entity240 told the @entity140 soon after the incident that @entity218 's career would not be hurt			0
" he 's known to be controversial and , if anything , it will make him more popular amongst his fans , who will have thought this was hilarious , " @entity240 told the newspaper			0
as @entity248 once said , " the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about			0
" @entity216 was at least familiar with the public spotlight as a well - known actor and narrator			0
on november 30 , the @entity254 published a story about @entity253 , a 39 - year old woman who had a rare sexual disorder known as ' persistent genital arousal			0
' the @entity254 worked with @entity253 and read her the entire story before it was published			0
she 'd written to the newspaper thanking it for showing an interest , adding : " i just hope this will educate people that this is serious and really exists , and that other women who are suffering in silence will now have the courage to talk to a doctor about it			0
" the day after the story was published , @entity253 killed herself			0
even sympathetic coverage and subsequent offers of help could not save her			0
it 's unclear whether the publicity about her condition was too much to bear ; she had previously attempted to take her own life			0
" it 's important to understand that suicide is complex , " says @entity276 , chief executive of the @entity277 , a @entity32 group that counsels people thinking of suicide			1
" although a catalyst may appear to be obvious , suicide is never the result of a single factor or event and is likely to have several interrelated causes , " @entity283 said on the group 's website soon after news emerged of @entity24 's death			1
if adults are vulnerable to what they perceive as public humiliation , teenagers are doubly so			0
@entity298 was an 18 - year old student at @entity300 who in 2010 was secretly filmed by his roommate having a sexual encounter with another man			0
a short while later he jumped to his death from a @entity306 bridge			0
@entity307 was not only humiliated but his humiliation was amplified by the fact that his roommate , @entity311 , shared the footage with others and tweeted about it			0
he was later convicted of bias intimidation and invasion of privacy and sentenced to 30 days in jail			1
the case seemed to bring together many of the factors that put the vulnerable even more at risk : technology that can record and distribute private acts in a matter of minutes ; the failure -- especially among many younger users of social media -- to understand the potential consequences of their postings ; and the uncertain state of the law in many places			1
it also highlighted an epidemic of teenage suicides in the @entity337 -- one that has coincided with the immersion of that age group in social media and texting for hours at a stretch			0
schoolyard bullying ends when recess does ; cyber-bullying is 24/7 and reaches into the bedroom , the mall and the classroom			0
when 15 - year old @entity350 killed herself in @entity352 two years ago , another student at her school told the media : " someone told her to go hang herself , and i do n't really know who that was , but she was getting bullied by some people , because there were people talking about her and i guess she did n't like being hated			0
" at first glance , many of these cases bear little resemblance to that of @entity2			0
but there are common threads			0
in the 21st century , personal humiliation can quickly go viral thanks to the reach and appetite of both social and mainstream media			0
within hours , the minor transgressions and innocent mistakes , the private behavior and anxieties of ordinary people can reach , or seem to reach , the ends of the earth			0
for a few , that exposure is quickly overwhelming .			0
