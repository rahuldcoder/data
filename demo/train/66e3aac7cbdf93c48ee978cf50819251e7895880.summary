@entity0 -- @entity4 was released from home confinement at 10:20 a.m. wednesday , 35 days after she began serving her sentence for misdemeanor theft and probation violation , a spokesman for the @entity0 sheriff said wednesday			1
the electronic monitoring bracelet was removed from @entity4 's ankle about 40 minutes before she was officially freed , spokesman @entity9 said			2
the actress was sentenced last month to 120 days in jail after she entered a guilty plea to stealing a necklace from a jewelry store in january			1
the judge had earlier sentenced her to the same jail term for violating her probation by being arrested in the theft case			2
the four months in jail translated into five weeks in home confinement because of jail overcrowding and state rules that allow for credit for good behavior for prisoners , @entity9 said			1
" i am not happy about house arrest , " @entity29 judge @entity28 said during a hearing last week			0
" it was not my sentence			0
" @entity4 must now resume work on the 480 hours of community service ordered as part of her sentence , including 360 hours at the @entity39			1
the last 120 hours will be served at the county morgue			1
@entity41 gave @entity4 a year to complete the community service			1
her supervised probation is scheduled to end within a year , unless @entity4 is charged with breaking any laws before then			2
it has been extended several times because of probation violations , including failed alcohol and drug tests			0
@entity4 failed an alcohol test administered by a probation officer on june 13 and was ordered to go before the judge for a probation violation hearing last week			2
but @entity4 's attorney convinced the judge the testing requirement had lapsed in february			2
@entity41 ruled that @entity4 is now allowed to drink alcohol and she is no longer required to take random drug tests			2
the actress , who turns 25 on july 2 , has managed to avoid more than a few days in jail despite two drunken - driving convictions , a long list of probation violations and the recent theft conviction			1
" because of budget constraints and because we 're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation , nonviolent offenders , lesser crimes , get 20 % of their sentence , " @entity65 's spokesman @entity9 said			0
@entity4 entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge			1
but @entity28 made it clear in court last month that she did n't think drugs and alcohol were the root of @entity4 's legal troubles			0
" she 's got other problems for which she self - medicates , " @entity28 said at her sentencing in may			0
@entity4 's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken - driving arrests in 2007			1
since then , she 's spent more than eight months in substance - abuse rehabilitation programs			0
a probation report released last month said the actress " appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues			0
" " it would appear that the defendant 's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity , " the probation report said , yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail			0
@entity4 tested positive for alcohol use , a violation of probation rules , in february , the report said			0
it also revealed that the drug test failure last august , which resulted in a jail sentence and court - ordered rehab , involved cocaine and amphetamines			1
@entity1 's @entity110 contributed to this report			0
