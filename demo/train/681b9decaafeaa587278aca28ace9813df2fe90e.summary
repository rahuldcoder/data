on mondays , the @entity0 in @entity1 runs a special on various strains of recreational marijuana			1
customers can score an eighth of an ounce of premium weed for the same price they 'd normally pay for a lower - grade , then take it home and use it , just for fun			1
on any given monday in @entity12 , possessing an eighth of an ounce of any grade marijuana is a misdemeanor that can land you in prison for up to 180 days			1
it carries a fine of up to $ 2,000			0
possessing more than 2 ounces means an even harsher punishment			0
the two states illustrate a nation divided by the legalization of marijuana			1
last year , a @entity2 / @entity27 survey found 55 % of those polled supported legalization ; 44 % opposed it			0
on january 1 , @entity1 celebrated its first anniversary of legal recreational marijuana sales			1
@entity33 has allowed the sale of recreational weed since june 1 , 2014			1
@entity36 and @entity37 will join them in 2016			0
voters in the nation 's capital have also approved a recreational marijuana initiative , but the law is still pending congressional approval			1
twenty - seven states and the @entity46 have either legalized medical marijuana or decriminalized marijuana possession -- or both			1
yet @entity12 is one of 23 states that still prohibits cannabis outright			2
how did we get here ? in 1970 , @entity54 passed the @entity55 , which listed marijuana as a schedule i drug			2
since then , it has been illegal to manufacture , distribute or possess marijuana in the @entity60 , according to the federal government			2
however in august 2013 , the @entity62 said it would n't challenge @entity1 or other states with laws legalizing recreational marijuana			1
instead , federal officials decided to focus on stopping drug trafficking and keeping marijuana away from children			2
in other words , states are effectively free to ignore the federal ban			2
so what happens if you 're caught with marijuana varies on where you are			2
private possession of up to 1 ounce carries no penalty in @entity1 , and growing up to six marijuana plants ( with no more than three being mature ) at home is perfectly legal for someone 21 or older			1
@entity33 permits adults to possess up to 1 ounce of cannabis , and / or up to 16 ounces of marijuana - infused solid products and 72 ounces of marijuana - infused liquid products for their own private , personal use			1
using marijuana in public is still a civil violation and subject to a fine			2
similar to @entity33 and @entity1 , the @entity36 and @entity37 laws will also create a commercial regulatory system for the production , distribution and sale of marijuana			2
@entity46 's proposal , while more reserved than others , allows for people 21 or older to possess up to 2 ounces of marijuana for personal use and grow up to six cannabis plants in their home			1
yet @entity54 has authority over the city 's finances , so tucked into the recent spending bill is a provision that bars the @entity46 from using any of its own money or federal funds to regulate the use of pot. as previously mentioned , many states have decriminalized marijuana ; it is still against federal law , but generally speaking , you wo n't get prison time or a criminal record on first offenses for carrying small amounts for personal use			1
you can still be hit with a civil fine , similar to a minor traffic violation			0
these relaxed laws have pro-marijuana legalization activists enthused			0
many are already looking toward 2016 , when ballot initiatives in @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 other states are likely to be put to voters			2
movement on the medical front in august 2013 , @entity2 's dr. @entity141 wrote an editorial , " why i changed my mind on weed			2
" in it , he detailed the reasons he believes marijuana should not be listed as a schedule i drug			0
" it does n't have a high potential for abuse , and there are very legitimate medical applications , " he wrote			0
marijuana contains two main active ingredients : cannabidiol , or @entity157 , and tetrahydrocannabinol , or @entity159			0
the touted health benefits of these ingredients range from pain relief to seizure control			0
while the @entity165 has not made a change in its classification , many medical organizations have called for restrictions on research to be loosened			0
we need to know , they seem to be collectively saying , whether cannabis is more helpful or harmful			0
most recently , the @entity173 released a position paper ( @entity175 ) in support of " efforts to conduct rigorous research to evaluate the long - term safety and effectiveness of marijuana - based products			1
" " further research is needed to determine the benefits and safety of such products , " the authors wrote			0
" this is of paramount importance when marijuana - based products are used in patients with underlying neurologic disorders , or in children whose developing brains may be more vulnerable to the toxic effects of marijuana			1
" as restrictions loosen , the evidence for the legalization of medicinal marijuana is growing			0
a study published in august in @entity201 found that states that have legalized marijuana for managing chronic pain have significantly fewer deaths from prescription painkiller overdoses each year			1
still , research on the long - term effects of marijuana use is limited			1
a study published in september in @entity211 showed teens who use marijuana daily before age 17 are more than 60 % less likely to get their high school diploma than those who 've never used pot. @entity217 adolescent users were 18 times more likely to become dependent on marijuana , seven times more likely to attempt suicide and eight times more likely to use other illegal drugs in the future			0
but is that because of their marijuana use ? or are other factors at play ? another study found that compared to nonusers , teens who smoked marijuana have less gray matter in their orbitofrontal cortexes -- the area of the brain that helps you make decisions			0
researchers have also found that the reward center in the brains of 18 to 25 year olds who smoke marijuana at least once a week is different than the reward center in those who have no history of cannabis use			0
yet some studies suggest the long - term effects may not be as damaging as this research suggests			0
a small study of 110 adults published recently in the @entity255 journal found that while chronic marijuana users may have less gray matter , the connectivity channels in their brain are stronger , which could allow them to compensate , the study authors say			0
many believe that as marijuana laws across the country continue to change , so too will the medical community 's opinion .			1

only four states have legalized recreational marijuana use
twenty - seven states and @entity46 have legalized medical marijuana use and / or decriminalized possession
