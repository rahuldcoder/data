-- along with hearing the announcement about the @entity3 tuesday , we 've learned that @entity5 's @entity4 -- which has been marketed by @entity3 for some time -- will now actually be able to connect directly to the @entity3 network			1
we realize that connecting the device to the network sounds like a no - brainer			0
however , for the past few months , folks with @entity12 have had to buy separate external @entity14 devices in order to connect when @entity16 was n't available			0
now , as @entity5 's exclusivity with @entity18 comes to a close , the @entity4 will be able to connect directly to @entity3 's @entity20 -- and who knows , perhaps even its @entity22 -- network			1
the latter would bring it to parity with @entity28 's @entity27 , a new @entity29 - powered tablet recently announced at @entity30			0
@entity4 with embedded @entity3 chips will be coming soon ; however , an exact release date has n't yet been set			1
the @entity4 first came to @entity3 in october 2010			2
although connecting to the network when @entity16 was n't present did require a bundled @entity14 , costs were comparable and data plans were better than what @entity18 customers were getting			0

@entity5 's @entity4 will now be able to connect directly to @entity3 network
no release date set for @entity4 with embedded @entity3 chips
@entity4 first came to @entity3 in october 2010
