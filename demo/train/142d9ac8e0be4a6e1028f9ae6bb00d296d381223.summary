so much for being underwhelmed			2
after @entity3 's two new @entity2 -- the @entity4 and @entity5 -- disappointed some observers when they were unveiled last week , the first round of reviewers are now rendering their verdicts after spending time with the devices			1
and in contrast to initial reactions , which included yawns from tech sites and a dip in @entity3 's stock price , the first wave of reviews are largely singing the praises of the new phones -- particularly the top - of - the - line @entity4 , which comes packed with an upgraded 64 - bit processor , souped up camera and @entity3 's first - ever @entity23 fingerprint - scanning system			1
many noted that , like the @entity25 before , the @entity4 is more of an upgrade of the 5 than a radically new device , a fact that probably led to a lot of the mixed initial response			1
but under the hood , many say the @entity4 is truly different , and one reviewer is even calling it the best smartphone on the market			1
here are some of those reviews			2
unless otherwise noted , the reviewer is referring to the @entity4			1
@entity39 , @entity40 " the @entity4 is the first digital device i 've seen with a simple , reliable fingerprint reader -- one you can confidently use , without a thought , to unlock the device instead of typing in a passcode			1
... it sounds like a gimmick , but it 's a real advance , the biggest step ever in biometric authentication for everyday devices			2
" " my biggest disappointment is that there have been only minor improvements to the keyboard			2
unlike in @entity56 , @entity3 still bars you from substituting third - party keyboards with better auto - correction ...			2
overall , however , the new @entity4 is a delight			1
its hardware and software make it the best smartphone on the market			1
" @entity66 , @entity67 " @entity3 has worked some behind - the - scenes magic with its latest and greatest , and made some design changes for the better , too , all of which adds up to a new smartphone market king			1
" " at first glance , it 's easy to dismiss the fingerprint sensor as a whiz - bang feature designed to attract eyeballs and do little else			2
but this is n't that			0
... it feels like a mature feature that actually enhances the overall experience of using an @entity4 in a noticeable way that you encounter very frequently			1
" " the hardware may resemble its predecessor in many key ways , as with the 4 - inch retina display , but it improves dramatically in areas like the camera where it makes the most difference to every day users , and in the addition of the fingerprint sensor , which is already a feature i miss when i switch back to older generation devices or the @entity5			1
" @entity97 , @entity98 " like the s - devices that came before it , the @entity4 is left in the unfortunate position of not being able to significantly differentiate itself visually from its predecessor			1
... i think gold is likely the phone i 'd opt for simply because it 'd be very different than everything else i have , but otherwise space grey is probably the best looking of the three devices to me			0
" " it remains to be seen the impact display size has on @entity4 sales			1
anecdotally i know a number of die hard @entity4 users who simply want a larger display and are willing to consider @entity56 as a result			1
i still believe that users do n't really cross shop between @entity56 and @entity120 , but if @entity3 does n't offer a larger display option soon then i believe it will lose some users not because of cross shopping , but out of frustration			0
" " at the end of the day , if you prefer @entity120 for your smartphone -- the @entity4 wo n't disappoint			1
in many ways it 's an evolutionary improvement over the @entity130 , but in others it is a significant step forward			2
what @entity3 's silicon teams have been doing for these past couple of years has really started to pay off			0
" @entity135 , @entity136 " if we 're reaching a point of diminishing returns in hardware breakthroughs , the software breakthroughs are only just getting under way.the new iphones come with @entity120 , a redesigned operating system			0
... this software looks nothing like the old @entity120			0
it 's all white and clean , almost barren			0
... you might love this design , and you might loathe it			0
you also might get used to it			0
but in any case , @entity120 is more efficient to navigate , because nothing on the screen is eye candy ; everything is a button , so you spend less time hunting for things			0
" " if you wanted to summarize ... here it is : @entity3 still believes in superb design and tremendous polish			0
the @entity4 is no longer the only smartphone that will keep you delighted for the length of your two - year contract -- but it 's still among the few that will			1
" on the @entity5 : " it 's essentially identical to last year 's @entity4 , except that its back and sides are a single piece of plastic instead of metal and glass			1
it 's a terrific phone			0
it will sell like hot cakes			0
... but just sheathing last year 's phone in shiny plastic is n't a stunning advance			2
" @entity176 , @entity40 on the @entity5 : " you 've seen this phone before			1
sure , it has a new name : @entity4 5c			1
and its plastic body comes in different colors			2
it also has an attractive price when tied to a wireless contract			0
but the 5c is really a slightly improved @entity4 5 , which @entity3 is no longer offering			1
while the 5c looks and feels very familiar , it 's still a good phone and an improvement over the 5			0
but its improvements are evolutionary , not revolutionary			0
" @entity190 , @entity191 " though it 's easy to dismiss this handset as iterative , the 5s is the first smartphone with full 64 - bit support and a capacitive fingerprint sensor , and it also ships with a fresh , revamped version of @entity120			2
this might not matter to folks who were content with the status quo , but it matters a lot to @entity3 -- and to the company 's future as well -- especially if the company wants to fend off an increasingly fierce pack of competitors			0
" " the 5s is a solid effort from @entity3 , but its true worth is yet to be determined			0
if developers come up with clever ways to take advantage of the @entity217 coprocessor and the 64 - bit support in @entity120 , the 5s will truly shine			0
if not , many people might just wait it out another year			0

early reviews positive for the @entity4
" the best smartphone on the market , " says one reviewer
some say fingerprint scanner is significant , not a gimmick
@entity5 called " @entity4 , but colorful plastic "
