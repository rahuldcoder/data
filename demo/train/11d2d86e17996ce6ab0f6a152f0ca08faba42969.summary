@entity1 ' pessimism about the nation 's economic conditions , and skepticism that government can help solve that problem , delivered @entity7 their midterm beating this cycle , a team of bipartisan pollsters found in a midterm postmortem survey			1
@entity7 pollster @entity13 and @entity15 pollster @entity14 said those were the main takeaways from their final @entity17 of the cycle , conducted dec. 7 - 11 among 1,000 registered voters nationwide			1
and they said the survey has grave implications for the @entity7 if they ca n't craft a cohesive , convincing message on the economy			1
" tell me who is ahead on the economy in 2016 and i 'll tell you who is going to be president , " @entity13 said at a @entity25 event on thursday			2
she noted that " voters ' economic anxiety is deep - seated , and shows no signs of abating			0
" the poll found that a vast majority of @entity1 , 77 percent , said they 're at least somewhat worried about the nation 's current economic conditions			2
and voters in the middle class are the most pessimistic about the economy , the pollsters found			2
that points to why , @entity13 and @entity14 said , @entity7 had so much trouble this cycle and ultimately lost control of the @entity46 to @entity15 and gave the @entity15 their biggest majority in the @entity48 since the 1920s			1
democrats aimed their midterm message at middle class voters , highlighting policies like a minimum wage hike and fair pay legislation that they said polled well with the middle class			0
but that strategy was too " piecemeal , " @entity13 wrote in her analysis of the poll , and " struck voters as falling well short of the level of change necessary to set our country and our economy back on track			0
" and @entity7 had trouble selling the public government solutions for their problems because , the poll found , @entity1 voters are still split on whether government can solve them to begin with			1
" voters want government to intervene , but they fear what the government will do if it wades into the important task of ensuring the economic stability of voters , " @entity14 said			0
a slight majority , 52 percent , said the government should do more to solve problems and help meet the needs of people , while 48 percent said it should get out of the way and let the free market help people get ahead			0
many in the party have diagnosed that very issue as one of the main reasons the party fared so poorly in the midterms .			0
