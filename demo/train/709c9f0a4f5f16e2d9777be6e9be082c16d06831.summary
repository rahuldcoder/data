@entity0 -- @entity5 , the poet whose deeply felt descriptions of rural life in @entity8 managed to carry larger echoes of the island 's violent sectarian split , died friday at the age of 74 , his publisher said			1
@entity5 died in @entity13 , @entity8 , after a short illness , the publishing house @entity15 announced on behalf of his family			2
one of the most widely read poets of the past hundred years , @entity5 carried the long lineage of @entity21 authorship into an era of violence that marked @entity21 for much of the later twentieth century			1
" we are blessed to call @entity5 our own and thankful for the gift of him in our national life , " @entity21 prime minister @entity24 said friday			1
" he belongs with @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 in the pantheon of our greatest literary exponents			1
" @entity5 joined three of those writers -- @entity29 , @entity30 , and @entity31 -- as a recipient of the @entity37 literature prize			1
the 1995 citation noted @entity5 's " works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth , which exalt everyday miracles and the living past " as a reason for bestowing the honor on a fourth @entity41			1
born in 1939 on a farm in @entity48 , in @entity8 , @entity5 's work , which relied heavily on personal observations , evoked the island 's rural heritage at close range			1
the eldest of nine children , @entity5 -- a @entity56 -- described his father to an interviewer in 1994 as a " creature of the archaic world " who " would have been entirely at home in a @entity63 hill - fort			1
" in " follower , " from the collection " @entity66 , " @entity5 recalled being brought up around country farmers , like his father , whom he idealized -- but who later in life came to represent a bygone era : i wanted to grow up and plough , to close one eye , stiffen my arm			1
all i ever did was follow in his broad shadow round the farm			0
i was a nuisance , tripping , falling , yapping always			0
but today it is my father who keeps stumbling behind me , and will not go away			0
the family spoke @entity82 , not @entity21 , and @entity5 described in interviews living in a home without many books			1
he attended a boarding school in @entity87 beginning at age 12 and studied for an @entity82 literature degree at @entity90 in @entity91			0
@entity87 -- ruled by @entity92 , despite a majority catholic population -- would eventually become the center of @entity8 's decades - long period of sectarian violence			2
@entity5 moved in 1972 to @entity13 , where he wrote poems that reflected the struggle navigating between the @entity21 nationalist movement , which he supported , and an allegiance to his birthplace in the @entity103 - ruled @entity102			1
after " @entity66 , " @entity5 's reputation began to grow , and he eventually became the rare poet to achieve both critical acclaim and popular appeal			2
his collections featured a range of themes , from lighthearted love verses to deeply personal meditations on @entity21 's @entity113			1
his collection " @entity102 " was released in 1975 , one of the bloodiest years of @entity8 's sectarian conflict			2
in it , @entity117 mined the roots of @entity21 division , often offering a grim assessment of a nation facing constant misfortune			2
" @entity127 miseries , a bite and sup , / we hug our little destiny again , " he wrote in " @entity124			0
" decades after " @entity102 " was published , @entity5 characterized himself as a poet writing from his own experience rather than a political agenda			2
" what matters is the shape - making impulse , the emergence and convergence of an excitement into a wholeness , " he said			0
" i do n't think i 'm a political poet with political themes and a specifically political understanding of the world			0
" but he nonetheless held a lasting place within the history of @entity8 's struggle for peace , offering his deeply personal view of the @entity113 to a worldwide audience			0
" his mind , heart , and his uniquely @entity21 gift for language made him our finest poet of the rhythms of ordinary lives and a powerful voice for peace			0
and he was a good and true friend , " @entity159 and @entity160 , the former @entity162 president and first lady , wrote in a statement friday			0
as president , @entity165 helped broker the 1999 @entity167 that established @entity8 's system of government			0
later in life , @entity5 turned to producing new translations of well - known works of @entity174 literature , including a well - received version of " @entity176			1
" he worked as a professor of poetry at @entity179 for five years beginning in 1989 , and held various posts at @entity181 for more than two decades			0
