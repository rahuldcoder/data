-- tuesday brought a shocking result -- at least for @entity2 -- from the snowboard halfpipe , a magnanimous gesture from one country to another , and just another , ho hum , two gold medals for @entity9 in its favorite event			1
bad things for @entity12 was it the condition of the halfpipe ? was it the haircut ? or was it that some days you just get beat ? the big newsmaker in the men 's halfpipe was the guy who finished fourth ( which might be the worst place to finish if you make it to the @entity27 )			1
many @entity2 were crushed when they found out @entity12 not only did n't win , he did n't even get a medal			1
he seemed pretty disappointed himself			2
" i had a game plan , i had a specific run i wanted to land and i did n't get to put it down and that 's one of the most frustrating things , " he said of his mistakes			1
" if i get to land my run and i get beat i 'm ok with that , but it did n't work out that way			2
" but do n't pronounce the king dead just yet , he warned			2
those tricks he was landing in practice , ones that he did n't get to break out , they will " carry on for the next few years			2
" @entity12 , 27 , may be an old man among snowboarders , but he 's giving every indication he 'll be back for 2018			1
for now , it 's time for @entity46			2
we 're not referring to his results at @entity50			2
we 're referring to the band for which he plays guitar			1
he said it will be a nice break from competition			2
historic day for @entity2 women @entity59 did n't medal in the women 's ski jump , but she made history that ca n't be taken away			1
years from now , she can brag that she was the first woman to ever ski jump in the @entity65			1
tuesday did n't go the way she planned ; the 19 - year - old , who was a pre-event favorite despite a knee injury , finished 21st			2
after the event , she tweeted again , saying : " ya i did n't win a medal ... you can judge me all you want but you 'll never know how hard i worked to jump compete today as an @entity73			2
" trust me , we 're not judging			0
ski jumping takes equal parts crazy , determination and unreal athleticism			1
obviously at 19 she 'll have a chance to see several more olympics			0
she and the other female jumpers want to compete in a large hill and team event at the 2018 games in @entity87 just like the men			0
we 're thinking they 'll get their shot			0
over at the luge track , @entity91 slid into what is traditionally a @entity95 - only victory celebration and earned a bronze medal			0
it was the first medal for an @entity2 woman in singles			1
" luge is n't the biggest sport at home and we 've never won an individual medal			1
hopefully this gives it a boost			0
i 'm happy to pave the way to the future , " she said			0
@entity111 coach lends a hand , er , ski @entity114 of @entity115 was struggling			1
he was well out of contention in the cross-country sprint event after two crashes			0
during the first he broke a ski			1
during the second it snapped to the point it was unusable			0
still he was trying to complete the race , despite being almost three minutes behind in an event that takes just longer than that time frame			0
that 's when an opponent 's coach trucked out on the course with a spare ski			1
" i wanted him to have dignity as he crossed the finish line , " @entity111 @entity132 told the @entity133			1
he was baffled as to why the @entity133 even wanted to talk to him about the incident			1
any coach would do something like that , he said			1
but that 's just it , none of the other coaches , not even the @entity115 , made a move			1
medal marvels a lot of the sports at the @entity65 are dominated by one nation			0
speed skating -- the @entity152			0
snowboarding -- the @entity2 , well , most of the time			1
but no one has taken home as much hardware as @entity9 , a country of 5 million , has in cross-country skiing			0
they 've won 38 gold medals , the most top finishes in any @entity65 sport			1
they added to the total tuesday when @entity163 and @entity164 won the sprint events			1
it makes sense that @entity9 is so good at the sport			0
according to the @entity170 , in or about the year 1200 , @entity169 of @entity9 was the first to have his troops use skis in battle			0
he ordered his scouts to use them to spy during the @entity175			0
the first timed race was held in @entity9 in the 19th century			0
ok , enough of the history lessons			1
@entity9 now tops the overall medals table with 11 , six from cross-country skiing			0
letter for @entity181 we could all use a fan letter like this			0
@entity185 , who won the first women 's slopestyle snowboard event , received a " precious letter " from @entity189 , who is lives in @entity191 , @entity192 , and is in second grade			1
@entity194 says @entity196 reporter @entity195 noticed the letter posted to @entity185 's @entity199 account			0
@entity195 writes that the letter is beyond cute -- it 's adorable			1
@entity189 even interspersed different colored stars into a cheering letter that reads : dear @entity185 , i 'm so proud you made the @entity207 ( remember , she 's in second grade ) team ! i 've been reading about you and you are really amazing ! i learned that you like biking			0
i like biking , too			0
i hope you go high and do lots of tricks and do a really good job and do a nice job on the @entity196 team			0
you are really good at @entity218			0
rub the penny to get good luck			2
sincerely , @entity189 and @entity189 taped a penny to the letter			2
someone needs to get @entity189 her own gold medal .			2
