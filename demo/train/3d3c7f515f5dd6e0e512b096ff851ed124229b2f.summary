-- @entity2 's appearance before @entity4 legislators on wednesday represents not just a fact - finding mission by committee members and a public relations move by @entity8 , but a clash of cultures that in many ways created the recall controversy			1
" they turned a rather ordinary recall into a brand - threatening crisis , " said @entity13 , a professor of @entity15 studies at @entity18 's @entity17 campus in @entity19			1
indeed , a key reason why @entity2 is in the hot seat is because the company leadership responded in a very @entity17 fashion , @entity17 watchers say			1
" their decision - making process was painfully slow , but the international media and concerned customers do n't want to wait so long for answers , " @entity13 said			0
" anytime the public hears ' brake ' and ' problem ' in the same sentence , they want quick answers			0
" @entity2 's long silence as the company deliberated what to do is a hallmark of the @entity17 culture of consensus building			1
" the decision - making process is really the planning process in @entity17 -- you do n't see a lot of rapid response to a strategic issue , " said @entity43 , president of @entity44 , which provides communications advice to multinational companies			2
difficult , too , will be how @entity2 handles hostile questioning , especially since most of his public experience has been before a largely deferential @entity17 press			1
" there is a huge difference in how @entity17 media cover companies , " said @entity43 , who lived in @entity17 for a decade			2
" they are careful not to upset or annoy business leaders too much , because they do n't want their access to information or press conferences blocked because of negative reporting			0
" in the @entity66 , you take @entity67 , @entity68 or @entity69 -- once they are big , successful companies , they are targets ( of aggressive media ) , " he said			0
" that 's the trade - off for visibility and success			0
" how the two audiences -- @entity4 and @entity17 -- view @entity2 's performance may be very different because of cultural differences in body language			1
" @entity17 when in an apology mode -- especially before an authority like the @entity82 -- will be very humble			0
that means , you do n't necessarily look people in the eye , " said @entity83 , @entity19 managing partner of @entity84 & @entity85 , a communications consultancy			0
" from a @entity92 perspective , that can be mistaken as weakness or perhaps trying to hide something			0
" also , @entity17 language tends to be indirect -- whereas before the committee members are likely to pepper him with direct questions and " be a bit of political theater , " @entity43 added			1
" he 's got to walk a very fine line of polite respect -- which @entity17 have in bucket loads -- and the confidence of being head of one of the largest , most respected companies in the world , " @entity83 said .			2

@entity8 's handling of the recall crisis has elements of a culture clash
@entity2 's long silence is a hallmark of the @entity17 culture of consensus building
@entity2 has little experience dealing with hostile questions from the public
