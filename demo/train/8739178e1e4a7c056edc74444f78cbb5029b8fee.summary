@entity0 -- two @entity3 lawmakers took on the hot - button political issue of gun control monday , introducing legislation that would effectively ban online ammunition sales			1
longtime gun control advocates sen. @entity9 , @entity10 , and rep. @entity11 , @entity13 - @entity12 , introduced the bill that they said would prevent buyers from purchasing unlimited quantities of ammunition through the @entity19 or through the mail			1
the bill would also require ammunition dealers to report bulk ammo sales to law enforcement			2
" it 's time to close the loophole that 's allowing killers -- deranged , insane -- and even terrorists to buy ammunition online , " @entity9 said monday at a news conference on the steps of @entity28 's @entity27			1
" you do n't have to be a scientist to understand how wrong this is			0
" the lawmakers pointed to the @entity38 mass shooting earlier this month , where police in @entity40 said movie shooting suspect @entity41 purchased more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition online			1
@entity41 faces 24 murder counts on monday , @entity41 was charged with 24 counts of first - degree murder in the slayings of 12 people who had packed a screening of the latest @entity51 movie that began shortly after midnight on july 20			2
fifty - eight people were injured in the incident			0
" when you buy a gun on the @entity19 , you have go to a store to pick that gun up , " @entity11 said			2
" well if you 're going to be buying these kinds of large amounts of ammunition , you know what ? somebody should see your face			2
" @entity3 strategists see gun control as political dynamite			1
many democrats blame @entity71 's 2000 presidential election loss on his failure to win conservative states , an outcome they said was due in part to @entity71 's push for gun control			1
and many members of @entity77 admittedly do not want to run afoul of the powerful and well - funded @entity78			2
many @entity3 wo n't touch gun control last week , @entity80 democrat @entity79 , who represents a pro-gun congressional district , told @entity1 the @entity78 " carries with it a threat ... that if you speak against any point of gun control , you automatically face a political threat			1
" in fact , the @entity3 - led @entity86 has not voted on any gun legislation in three years , since defeating a 2009 @entity90 measure that would have required states to recognize each other 's gun laws			1
president @entity94 on thursday made his strongest comments yet on the issue , advocating a " common sense " approach to gun control that would prevent a " mentally unbalanced individual " from obtaining assault weapons			1
but he treaded carefully and did not push for new gun laws			2
" i , like most @entity102 , believe that the @entity103 guarantees an individual the right to bear arms , " @entity94 said			0
" but i also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that ak - 47s belong in the hands of soldiers , not in the hands of criminals			0
" @entity9 and @entity11 's proposed @entity114 would require ammunition buyers who are not licensed dealers to present photo identification at the time of purchase , effectively banning the online or mail order purchase of ammo by regular civilians			1
it also requires licensed ammunition dealers to report the sale of more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition to an unlicensed person within any five consecutive business days			0
@entity9 recognized that changing gun laws is a challenge			0
senate majority leader @entity133 , who controls the @entity86 's agenda , said thursday , " with the schedule we have , we 're not going to get into the debate on gun control			1
" house speaker @entity139 said thursday that existing laws should be enforced			0
" @entity109 , all right , are not allowed to be in the hands of criminals			0
that is the law , " he said			0
nonetheless , @entity9 said he thinks the bill 's chances are " pretty good			0
" " it 's going to be acted upon next week , and we 're very optimistic , " @entity9 said			0
gun owners debate in wake of @entity40 tragedy @entity1 senior congressional correspondent @entity153 contributed to this report .			0
