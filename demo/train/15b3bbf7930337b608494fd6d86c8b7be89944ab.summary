a doctor in rural @entity1 inundated with @entity3 patients says he 's had good results with a treatment he tried out of sheer desperation : an hiv drug			1
dr. @entity8 has given the drug , lamivudine , to 15 @entity3 patients , and all but two survived			1
that 's about a 13 % mortality rate			0
across @entity16 , the virus has killed 70 % of its victims			0
outside @entity8 's @entity3 center in @entity19 , four of his recovering patients walk the grounds , always staying inside the fence that separates the @entity3 patients from everyone else			1
" my stomach was hurting ; i was feeling weak ; i was vomiting , " @entity25 , 23 , says of her bout with the virus			0
" they gave me medicine , and i 'm feeling fine			0
we take it , and we can eat -- we 're feeling fine in our bodies			0
" @entity25 and the other 12 patients who took the lamivudine and survived , received the drug in the first five days or so of their illness			1
the two patients who died received it between days five and eight			1
" i 'm sure that when [ patients ] present early , this medicine can help , " @entity8 said			1
" i 've proven it right in my center			0
" two doctors for 85,000 people @entity8 is mindful that lamivudine can cause liver and other problems , but he says it 's worth the risk since @entity3 is so deadly			1
he also knows @entity53 researchers will say only a real study can prove effectiveness			0
that would involve taking a much larger patient population and giving half of them lamivudine and the other half a placebo			2
" our people are dying and you 're taking about studies ? " he said			0
" it 's a matter of doing all that i can do as a doctor to save some people 's lives			0
" @entity71 warns companies about fake @entity3 drugs @entity8 said he got the idea to try lamivudine when he read in scientific journals that @entity77 and @entity3 replicate inside the body in much the same way			1
" @entity3 is a brainchild of @entity77 , " he said			1
" it 's a destructive strain of @entity77			2
" at first he tried a drug called acyclovir , which is often given to @entity77 patients to treat infections that occur with their weakened immune systems			1
but it did n't seem to be effective			0
then he tried lamivudine on a health care worker who 'd become ill , and within a day or two he showed signs of improvement and survived			0
one woman walked in , and the @entity3 nightmare began dr. @entity93 , director of the @entity94 says that theoretically , @entity8 's approach has some merit			1
@entity97 is a nucleocide analog , and other drugs in this class are being studied to treat @entity3			2
@entity93 asked @entity101 to give @entity8 his email address , saying perhaps his lab could do some follow up work			2
@entity8 says he plans to email @entity93 this weekend			2
woman saves three relatives from @entity3			0
