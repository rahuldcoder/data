-- the bad news just keeps coming for @entity3 champions @entity2			1
already out of the @entity9 and @entity8 , another @entity6 @entity5 defeat to @entity7 at the weekend left the club lagging 15 points behind leaders @entity12 and now an online survey of @entity16 fans reveals the @entity18 club has eclipsed @entity2 as the most popular football club in @entity16			1
@entity12 edged @entity21 ' side as the most popular club with @entity24 side @entity23 third , and ahead of @entity26 giants @entity27 and @entity28			1
@entity29 was chosen as the most popular national side in @entity16 ahead of @entity31 and @entity26 while the @entity3 was the overwhelming favorite national division among @entity16 fans , receiving 50 % of the votes ahead of @entity26 's @entity34 and @entity31 's @entity35 the survey was conducted by @entity38 's center for the @entity39 ( @entity40 ) in @entity6 between september and november last year , and drew a total of 15,586 responses			1
@entity40 researcher @entity43 offered a possible explanation for why @entity16 football fans may prefer @entity12 to @entity2 , which has regularly toured in the @entity46			1
" fans are more likely to support a club team when players from their favorite national squad regularly make the starting line - up , " said researcher @entity43 , who worked on the survey			2
" this means players like @entity56 and @entity57 , both @entity29 international players and players for @entity12 , are likely to fulfill an important commercial and marketing role for club , country and league			2
" @entity12 first played in @entity16 in 1995 but did not tour again until 2011 , reportedly because manager @entity64 preferred to focus on preseason training in @entity66 rather than embarking on potentially lucrative international tours			2
many of @entity12 's @entity3 rivals , including @entity2 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , have traveled to @entity16 and other @entity74 nations in the hope of boosting their preseason coffers			1
but professor @entity77 , director of the @entity40 , argues the potential revenue from a club 's global fanbase is not being maximized			0
" there 's no doubt that clubs generate revenue from @entity16 , @entity86 and @entity87 , " @entity77 explained on @entity81			0
" whether they make a profit is a different matter			0
" typically , less than 10 % of turnover from a @entity3 club comes from overseas sales			2
compare @entity66 football to @entity95 in @entity16 , for example			0
" the @entity95 has physical and marketing infrastructure set up on the ground to capitalize on opportunities to serve fans and customers			0
" for now , @entity12 and its @entity3 peers still deem it worthwhile to travel east to play in front of their global fans , but they face growing competition from @entity16 's domestic game			1
the @entity109 was established in 2004 , rebranding the @entity110 formed a decade earlier , and it has now been expanded to 16 teams			0
@entity112 is the club taking the domestic league by storm and last november it became the first @entity16 winners of the @entity116			1
the @entity16 champions claims it regularly attracts 45,000 fans			0
@entity112 is coached by @entity24 @entity119 , who guided @entity31 to the 2006 @entity120			0
the foundation for @entity119 's success is a group of burgeoning @entity16 talent ; he only has three international players among his ranks largely because the @entity16 league limits each club to employing five international players .			0

@entity12 is the most popular *soccer* club among @entity16 fans , according to a new survey
@entity2 and @entity23 were the next popular clubs in *16,000* - fan survey
@entity3 clubs still *struggle* to profit from overseas *fansbase*
