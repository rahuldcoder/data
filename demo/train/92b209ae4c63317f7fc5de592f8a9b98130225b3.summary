-- a new chapter in the fast - food wars was created with @entity3 hiring @entity4 , former @entity5 ceo , to lead its company			1
despite a decades - long relationship , @entity7 's terminated its contract with @entity3 due to this hiring decision			1
while @entity3 has not publicly addressed its reasons for naming @entity15 ceo , questions have been raised about the strategy behind recruiting him			1
perhaps , given his fast - food experience , the plan was to have him turnaround a relationship that had been falling apart for several years			2
while many perceive the hiring of @entity4 as an abrupt end to the @entity7 's relationship , it actually began souring during the 1973 tomato shortage			1
@entity3 , in a 2011 interview with the @entity30 , revealed that it only was serving two @entity32 markets -- @entity33 and @entity34 -- for @entity7 's			1
within that same article , @entity3 announced new ketchup packaging that , while not specifically developed to lure @entity7 's back , created hope that the door could be reopened			1
to date , that has not happened , and with @entity4 at the helm , the door is now completely closed			0
possibly , @entity3 expected @entity4 fast - food industry background to rejuvenate its @entity7 's relationship and drive revenue from it			1
if that was the rationale , the strategy clearly backfired			2
however , the expectation of success primarily based on prior industry experience parallels a common salesperson hiring strategy			1
executives in search of fast , high performance often focus their recruiting campaigns on candidates within their industry -- with a watchful eye on the competitor 's top salespeople			1
is this a brilliant growth strategy or a myth that , more often than not , leads to failure ? to share a story ... during the @entity68 , i was the director of sales for a large technology training company			2
at that time , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , and @entity73 were experiencing explosive growth -- which created tremendous demand for information technology training to support its products			0
while our company was doing well , a competitor had fallen on hard times which led to my receiving a phone call from one of its top salespeople			0
he , and a group of five others , were interested in joining our firm			0
it would be inaccurate to say that the six salespeople were interviewed by our company			0
the truth is job offers were fast - tracked because of their industry background			2
" this group requires no training and is bringing clients with them ... fast , high performance			0
" -- at least that is what we believed			0
all six accepted the job offers and all six were no longer with the company within ninety days of their hiring			2
we thought they would succeed ( and fast ) because of their industry experience -- but the plan was flawed			1
while they had been successful with a competitor , they were mismatched with our company			0
our executive team , like so many others , was blinded by the myth of assured success when hiring those with industry background			1
while prior industry experience is certainly helpful to a salesperson , it is not a guarantee of success -- far from it			1
many executives cite " complexity of the industry " as a reason to exclusively hire salespeople from competitors -- inferring that industry knowledge is too hard to teach			2
if that 's true , how did these executives learn their industry ? they certainly did n't come out of the womb with that insight			2
those executives are really communicating that they do n't want to train salespeople on the industry fundamentals			2
it also dangerously assumes that the competition is doing a better job of training salespeople than they are			0
of course , another reason executives pursue the competition 's salespeople is the expectation they will bring a book of business with them -- also a myth			0
moving clients from one supplier to another is very difficult to do - unless there are reasons other than the salesperson changing business cards			0
not to mention , there are potential legal issues when salespeople try to move " their " clients when changing jobs			0
limiting salesperson hiring to just those with industry experience creates a scalability problem for the company			1
there are only so many people with industry experience and only a small subset who the company would want on the team			1
what happens when the candidate pool runs dry and there are job openings on the sales team ? rather than blindly pursue those salespeople with industry mastery , first study each sales role and identify the factors that affect performance			0
what causes salespeople to succeed or fail in the role ? understanding the performance factors provides the means to carefully assess sales talent for matches to those factors			0
not only does this help identify which candidates with industry background will succeed in the company , but it also opens the door to strong candidates without prior industry experience			1
cast the " industry experience " requirement aside and hire those salespeople who have what it takes to succeed in the company			1
hiring right is the first step of positioning the business for success			0
the second is to create a sales on boarding program teaching salespeople the requisite knowledge to deliver fast , high performance for the company			0
reviewing performance factors before hiring and developing on boarding programs are not just sales hiring strategies			0
these steps are also applicable for leadership positions			0
had @entity3 taken this approach , they may have selected a different ceo to lead the company			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			2

@entity7 's terminated contract with @entity3 after hiring former @entity5 ceo
management expert @entity234 says hiring former competitors is flawed strategy
ignore " industry experience " hiring practice , says @entity230
