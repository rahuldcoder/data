-- more than 1 million cancer deaths could be prevented around the world if more nations , particularly low - and middle - income countries , implemented known strategies targeting such deaths , two international groups say			1
it 's doable , according to the @entity9 and @entity10 , if countries adopt measures to meet the " 25 by 25 " targets the @entity13 set last year			1
the targets aim to reduce premature deaths due to noncommunicable diseases by 25 % by 2025			1
cancer deaths total about 7.6 million worldwide each year			1
of those , 4 million are in people ages 30 to 69 -- defined as " premature " by the two cancer organizations			1
" with the right strategies , at least 30 % of ( all ) cancer cases can be prevented based on current knowledge , " according to the @entity9			1
the groups made the announcement monday , the eighth @entity26			1
the @entity9 -- the largest nongovernmental cancer - fighting organization with more than 760 partners in 155 countries -- organized the day to raise awareness among individuals and governments about cancer and cancer prevention			1
more than 450 events were held to raise awareness monday , the group said			2
this year 's theme : to highlight and dispel myths and misconceptions about cancer , including that it is a " disease of the wealthy , elderly and developed countries , " according to the organization			1
in reality , cancer affects those of all ages and income levels worldwide			2
more lives being saved : cancer death rates drop 20 % in fact , " more ( cancer ) deaths occur in lower and middle - income countries , than in high - income high cancer countries , even though there are twice as many cases in high - income countries , " said @entity49 , president of the @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52			1
@entity49 is the main author of @entity61 2012 , which was published by the institute and funded by @entity63 for the @entity64			0
according to his report , more than 1.6 million women worldwide will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year , compared with about 641,000 in 1980			2
more than 425,000 will die from the disease each year			0
" i was shocked by some of the things we found , " @entity49 said , adding he believes there are various reasons why women in poorer countries are diagnosed late			0
lack of treatment is one			0
he cites an example : in @entity82 , there is one trained oncologist for 150 million people			0
there 's also a lot of stigma preventing women from seeking treatment			2
" it 's a very , very sad thing , " @entity49 said			2
for example , in @entity92 and @entity93 , 100 % of women seek help with advanced or metastatic breast cancer , said @entity49			2
metastatic breast cancer means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body ; advanced breast cancer means it 's the most advanced stage of breast cancer that has not spread outside the breast			1
in both cases , a late diagnosis can impede efforts toward a cure			0
by comparison , the report said , " it is calculated that less than 10 % of the breast cancer patients in the @entity108 are diagnosed with @entity109 ( locally advanced breast cancer )			2
women in the @entity108 are not immune from late diagnoses			0
" after cancer , my real fight began @entity118 , a former director of the @entity108 @entity119 , on monday addressed the @entity120 in @entity121 , a gathering the @entity63 hosted			1
she described three women who died from cancer , either because they did n't know they had the disease or did n't take advantage of screening			0
they were her aunts , she said , and lived in the @entity108			0
two had breast cancer , and one had cervical cancer			0
@entity118 said it 's a problem " from @entity129 all the way to @entity131			1
" " we must get better at implementing what we already know , " said @entity118 , who is now president of @entity132			0
the summit launched its own " 25 " goal : to improve breast cancer survival and quality of life in 2.5 million women living in low - and middle - income countries by 2025			0
so much could be done , @entity49 said , if existing prevention screening techniques such as mammography and breast self - exams were used and existing treatments were available			0
he quoted the popular @entity147 slogan " just do it			0
" " if every woman in the world had adequate knowledge of breast cancer , had access to early diagnostic programs , had access to high - quality diagnostic services and ( was ) treated according to the most appropriate protocol for their particular disease , then breast cancer mortality would drop rapidly and significantly and have a profound effect on global women 's health , " according to the breast cancer report			1
why i donated my bone marrow			0
