@entity0 -- coroner 's investigator @entity2 returned to the stand in the eighth day of the trial of @entity7 's doctor thursday morning to continue her testimony about what she found in searches of the pop icon 's bedroom			1
the pathologist who conducted the autopsy on @entity7 and ruled his death a homicide could testify later thursday or friday in the involuntary manslaughter trial of dr. @entity18			1
jurors should also soon hear the two - hour interview @entity18 gave to police two days after @entity7 's june 25 , 2009 , death of what the coroner concluded was the result of " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with sedatives			1
@entity30 , who questioned @entity18 , is expected to testify thursday or friday that @entity18 told him he had been administering propofol to @entity7 regularly for two months to help him sleep			1
deputy district attorney @entity32 covered a table with drug vials and medical paraphernalia taken in @entity37 's searches , a visual display of @entity18 's in - home treatment of @entity7			1
@entity2 identified a saline bag that was cut open and an empty 100 milliliter propofol bottle inside			0
the prosecution alleges @entity18 used it as a makeshift iv drip to administer propofol to @entity7			1
the defense contends @entity18 gave @entity7 just 25 milliliters of the surgical anesthetic and used a syringe to push it in			1
twelve bottles of propofol were found in the bedroom during her first search the day @entity7 died , including an empty vial found on the floor next to the bed , @entity2 said			2
seven bottles of medications were on a nightstand next to the bed , including one with lorazepam pills prescribed by @entity18 to @entity7			1
@entity18 's defense lawyers say @entity7 caused his own death by swallowing eight lorazepam pills and orally ingesting propofol while @entity18 was out of the room			1
although crucial to prove that @entity18 is criminally responsible for the pop icon 's death , thursday 's forensic testimony is not likely to match wednesday 's emotional drama when jurors heard @entity7 's slurred voice telling his doctor " i hurt , you know , i hurt			1
" a photograph of @entity7 lying dead on a hospital gurney was later projected onto a large screen in the courtroom , a vivid reminder to jurors of why they will listen to a least a month of testimony			1
while the court camera feed focused on the disturbing image for just five seconds -- the result of an earlier decision to minimize public exposure to such shocking images -- it was displayed on a large screen in front of the jury for about two minutes			2
forensic computer expert @entity91 , who found the @entity7 audio file on @entity18 's @entity93 , said it was recorded on may 10 , 2009 , when @entity7 was preparing for his " @entity97 " concerts set for @entity96 two months later			1
prosecutors , who played a clip of the stunning audio in their opening statement last week , let the jury hear the entire recording in @entity18 's involuntary manslaughter trial wednesday			1
" @entity105 did n't do it			2
beatles did n't do it			2
we have to be phenomenal , " @entity7 said			2
" when people leave this show , when people leave my show , i want them to say , ' i 've never seen nothing like this in my life			0

" in the portion never before heard in court , @entity7 talked about his life and concern for children : " children are depressed			1

i care about them , them angels			0
@entity145 wants me to do it			0
@entity145 wants me to do it			0

" another voice , which the prosecutor said was @entity18 's , is heard saying , " i know you would			1
" " do n't have enough hope , no more hope , " @entity7 said			1
" that 's the next generation that 's going to save our planet , starting with -- we 'll talk about it			0
@entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , my babies			0
they walk around with no mother			0
they drop them off , they leave -- a psychological degradation of that			0
they reach out to me : ' please take me with you			0
' " at the end , @entity7 said he was " going to do that for them			2
" " that will be remembered more than my performances			0
my performances will be up there helping my children and always be my dream			0
i love them because i did n't have a childhood			2

' @entity189 , ' ' @entity190 , ' ' @entity191 , ' ' @entity192			0
' these are the songs i 've written because i hurt , you know , i hurt			0
" at the end , @entity7 told the doctor , " i am asleep			2
" his brother @entity197 wiped tears from his eyes as he listened in court			0
prosecutor @entity32 said in his opening statement that @entity7 was " highly under the influences of unknown agents " when @entity18 recorded @entity7			1
another recording found on @entity18 's phone and played in court wednesday was a voice mail from @entity208 , who was @entity7 's last manager			1
@entity208 's message to @entity18 , left five days before @entity7 's death , suggested that he " get a blood test " from @entity197 because " we 've got to see what he 's doing			1
" he referred to " an episode " @entity7 had at a rehearsal the night before			2
" he 's sick , " @entity208 said			0
concert producer @entity217 testified about @entity7 's illness in the first day of the trial , which he wrote about in an e-mail sent about the same time @entity208 was leaving his phone message			1
" he appeared quite week ( sic ) and fatigued this evening , " @entity217 wrote			0
" he had a terrible case of the chills , was trembling , rambling and obsessing			0
everything in me says he should be psychologically evaluated			0
" @entity18 's @entity93 also contained e-mail attachments that appeared to be @entity7 's medical records sent by @entity18 's office assistant to the doctor , who was gathering them for a @entity233 insurance agent who was arranging cancellation insurance for @entity7 's @entity96 concerts			1
the insurers were concerned about news reports that @entity7 was seen " at various times using a wheelchair " and that he suffered a back injury , lupus , emphysema and cancer , according to an e-mail from the agent to the doctor			2
@entity7 refused to authorize the release of his medical records to the insurance company , @entity18 wrote back , but he added concerning the news reports of illnesses , " let me say they 're all fallicious ( sic ) to the best of my knowledge			1
" one record shown in court , kept under the alias " @entity260 , " indicated that in september 2008 , @entity18 diagnosed @entity7 with insomnia and anxiety			1
it showed he treated him with valium and @entity263			0
files from the phone suggest @entity18 was dealing with the insurance agent 's request around the same time he said he was struggling to help @entity7 go to sleep with sedatives			1
the prosecution wants to show jurors that @entity18 was distracted by a long list of phone calls and e-mails , causing him to neglect @entity7 , who stopped breathing and died			1
prosecutors argue that @entity18 , who was @entity7 's personal doctor as he prepared for planned comeback concerts , is criminally responsible for the singer 's death because of medical negligence and his reckless use of the propofol to help @entity7 sleep			1
if convicted of involuntary manslaughter , @entity18 could spend four years in a @entity286 prison and lose his medical license .			2
