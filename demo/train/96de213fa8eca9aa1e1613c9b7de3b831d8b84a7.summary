do n't think that it matters much who controls the @entity9 , which is what is up for grabs this year			2
i mean , who could be inspired by @entity15 democrat @entity14 as she refuses to say whether she voted for president @entity16 , citing her constitutional right to privacy			0
( as a public candidate for public office , no less			0
) and then there 's her opponent , @entity22 sen. @entity22 , who is so eager to win re-election ( and possibly lead a @entity9 majority ) that while calling for the repeal of @entity27 , he also says that the @entity15 health care exchange — which is working well — could continue			2
" i think it 's fine to have a website , " he allowed			2
huh ? so ok , i get that , to a degree , this is a @entity33 election , a show about nothing			2
except for this : when the show is over , and if control of the @entity9 changes to the @entity39 , it could matter			1
not in the suddenly - we - are - all - going - to - work - together kind of way			0
but rather , in the it 's - in - my - self - interest - to - get - something - done kind of way			2
without being too pollyannish , let me posit this : if there is unified @entity39 control of the legislative branch , @entity39 would be smart to do some much - needed repair work on the brand			1
this is not an argument for voting for @entity39 ; it 's a possible route out of the gridlock			1
right now , too many voters see the @entity39 as just the party of stopping stuff , not inventing stuff			1
in a midterm election , that can work : @entity16 is unpopular , tie all candidates to @entity16			2
but if @entity39 take charge of the @entity70 , they will have run out of excuses			1
and they will have the opportunity to say , hey , it was n't us bollixing up the works			0
ah , you say , but what about president @entity16 ? he 's got a legacy to think about , and he 'll be thinking about it , you can be sure			2
he 's got as much self - interest here as does the @entity39 brand : he came into the @entity84 with a vision of a transformational presidency			1
he 's now all about issuing executive actions			0
that 's not what he really wants , either			0
the issue that comes to mind , of course , is immigration reform — which has been hanging out there so long it just gets messier and messier			1
the governing conundrum is outlined perfectly in the @entity98 analysis : in order to keep their @entity84 majority , congressional republicans do n't need @entity103 votes			1
and @entity103 are conspicuously underrepresented as voters in most of the pivotal @entity9 races of 2014 , excepting @entity106			0
but if the @entity39 actually wants to win a presidential election , author @entity107 writes , " the @entity39 will need a substantial number of @entity103 votes			1
" all of which means that , at a certain point , @entity39 leaders need to decide one thing : do they want to remain a congressional party ? or would they actually like to become a presidential party once again ? if they do something — and get the issue off the front burner — they might actually have a shot at it			1
their biggest burden : convince the recalcitrant , self - interested , hell - no rank - and - filers to actually get something done			0
and , by the way , for the country			0
there 's one logic that rules midterm elections -- in which @entity39 candidates have political reasons to rail against immigration reform			1
then there 's another logic that takes hold when you try to set the table for a presidential candidate , and campaign — no matter what some party diehards argue			1
presidential elections are about big things			0
parties — and candidates — that shrink from solutions seem small , unworthy			0
sure , it depends on the @entity39 candidate			1
( as in : @entity155 or @entity154 ? ) and it also depends on president @entity16			0
what can he accept as a compromise ? would he be willing to accept a measure that provides some sort of secure legal status rather than a complete path to citizenship ? and how would @entity164 react to that ? lots of unknowns , of course			0
and one of the biggest is whether @entity39 — after more than four years out of the @entity84 — have learned how tough it is to run the country from the other end of @entity174			1
if they have n't figured that out , then the cynicism will be warranted			0
this election wo n't matter .			0

@entity179 says some argue this year 's election is about nothing
she says republicans have a chance to make a *difference* after the midterms
@entity179 : if they do well and gain influence , will they want to give party a positive message ?
@entity179 : immigration reform could test whether @entity39 wants to control @entity84 again
