" @entity1 " is wrapping another season chock - full of upstairs , downstairs drama			1
how will it end ? the hit @entity4 import completed its third season in the @entity4 last year , but it has n't stopped a record number of @entity8 viewers from tuning in on @entity9			1
the show is in more demand than ever , winning outstanding ensemble in a tv drama series at last month 's @entity14			2
with sunday 's finale , there are only 95 minutes left to answer the many questions on viewers ' minds			1
season three has been filled with startling revelations from the ever - dramatic @entity23 family and the employees of their @entity26 country estate			1
show creator @entity27 made sure to pack in the first six episodes with as much plot development as there are characters -- from @entity32 and @entity34 's wedding to the release of mr. @entity36 from prison , from the birth of @entity40 's first child ( immediately followed by poor @entity40 's shocking passing ) to the financial hardships plaguing @entity1			1
@entity43 is counting down the top five questions we want answered in the third season 's conclusion			1
@entity9 ' official masterpiece site promises both the flaring up of new romances and the unfolding of a new crisis on " @entity1			1
" let 's make some predictions , shall we ? 1			0
will @entity32 finally get her heir ? @entity32 was most recently seen opening up to husband @entity34 about a surgery she had to ensure she would no longer have problems in the fertility department			0
with that sorted out , it 's time for the handsome couple to get to work on creating an heir to the @entity1 kingdom			1
but with the complications her younger sibling faced during childbirth in the back of her mind , will @entity32 hold off on having children ? all seems well with the newlyweds , and everyone in the @entity23 family is awaiting @entity32 's pregnancy , but nothing is ever as perfect as it appears in this home			0
is @entity76 already moving on from @entity40 ? the finale takes place more than a year after @entity40 's unexpected death , and widower @entity80 may be moving on to someone new			2
for viewers , it 's only been a few weeks since losing the youngest @entity23 daughter , and fans may not be ready for a new woman in @entity88 's life			2
@entity76 finally found his place in the @entity23 family as he became manager of the @entity1 estate			1
but is he getting too comfortable already ? previews for sunday 's episode imply something may be brewing between the chauffeur - turned - gentleman and the new maid			2
will @entity80 give into temptation , or will he remain the consummate gentleman ? either way , quick trysts are n't uncommon within the walls of @entity1			1
are the karma police coming for @entity104 ? the ever - scheming @entity104 spent season three trying to make life a living hell for her former partner in crime , @entity107			2
unfortunately for the maid , everything came to a screeching halt by the end of last week 's episode			0
@entity104 believed she had gotten rid of @entity107 once and for all after @entity114 caught him making unwarranted advances on @entity116			0
@entity107 won the battle by gaining unexpected support from both @entity119 and longtime adversary @entity36			0
the former valet not only retained a position at @entity1 but actually received a promotion			1
@entity104 has been known by viewers for her deviant behavior since the start of the series , but she may have finally met her match this season			2
@entity107 recently brought up the infamous " bath soap incident " of the first season that caused @entity132 's miscarriage			2
will we finally see the two come to blows ? one can only hope			0
will @entity137 finally get some respect ? while @entity32 was getting hitched and @entity40 was getting knocked up , poor @entity137 was getting left at the altar			0
not one to let a man get her down , the ever - resilient middle sister of the @entity23 clan went on a quest to find her own voice			0
@entity137 defied the outdated expectations of her family by taking on a job writing a newspaper column			0
as the cherry on top , @entity137 finally found an exciting gentleman friend in her editor			2
that is , before she discovers he is already spoken for			0
just as @entity137 finds confidence in her independence and becomes a prime example of 1920s feminism , she is forced to quit to avoid the advances of a married man			0
can @entity27 cut @entity137 some slack already ? when will the most jolly nice of all who reside at @entity1 finally have something go her way ? 5			1
who dies ? a death has been teased since production began on season three , but we 're not convinced @entity40 will be the only victim before 1921 's end			1
rumors have surrounded the departure of star @entity173 , who plays resident heartthrob @entity23			0
that said , there has n't been anything set up in the first six episodes to insinuate that @entity34 might be in any trouble			0
as any seasoned " @entity1 " viewer knows , no one knows how to execute a great surprise like @entity27			1
let 's explore all the possibilities before jumping to any conclusions			0
this is the current heir to the @entity1 estate we 're talking about , after all			1
perhaps one of @entity107 ' many victims , from @entity104 to @entity116 to @entity36 , seeks revenge			0
could it be @entity76 joining his beloved wife in the afterlife ? his child is certainly in good hands now that @entity80 has agreed to let @entity88 grow up in the house			0
regardless , viewers may need to get their black garb ready and prepare for the demise of a fan favorite			0
of course , these are n't the only things on our minds as we emotionally prepare for sunday 's finale			1
we are still dying to know who the @entity205 will sass in this episode and why ? and we 're still stunned at the choice to bring heedless @entity209 back for a second episode			2
let 's just hope @entity1 is n't coming down with a case of @entity213 , which famously ruined " @entity215			1
" what do you want to see happen on " @entity1 " ? let us know and check your local listings for its airtime sunday on @entity9 .			1

season three of " @entity1 " concludes sunday on @entity9
there are still plenty of questions to be answered for @entity8 fans
