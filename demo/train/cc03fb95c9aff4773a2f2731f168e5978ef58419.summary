@entity0 -- an @entity3 official assigned to @entity0 to clean up corruption in the 1980s testified tuesday he was overruled by his superiors when he suggested decades ago that @entity6 be shut down as an @entity3 informant			1
" they did n't do it			0
i did n't like it , but there was nothing i could do about it , " said @entity10 , the former assistant special - agent - in - charge of the @entity0 office , who testified his bosses at @entity3 headquarters in @entity16 " felt @entity6 was the person who was going to bring down the @entity20			1
" prosecutors have charged @entity6 with participating in 19 murders in a 32 - count indictment that also accuses the alleged @entity25 mob boss of racketeering , money laundering , and extortion during some two decades			1
defense witness testifies @entity6 did n't seem much of an informant during that time , according to previous testimony from a disgraced former @entity3 agent , @entity6 was also an @entity3 informant instrumental in the takedown of the @entity20 , @entity34			1
@entity35 , who was in charge of the drug task force in the organized crime squad , said he was not more forceful in pushing to cut off @entity6 as an informant because of the @entity3 's " quasi-military " structure , saying it would have been a " violation of protocol " to take his concerns any higher			1
he testified that his recommendation on @entity6 came after a 30 - minute meeting in which @entity6 did most of the talking			1
even though he was the second - highest - ranking agent in @entity0 at the time , @entity35 played down the scope of his authority , suggesting he was undermined by @entity6 's @entity3 handlers , apparently unaware at the time that they were being paid off by @entity6			1
but @entity35 testified monday that during the 30 - minute meeting , @entity6 indicated that the @entity3 was n't paying him , but that he was paying the @entity3			1
asked why he did n't investigate the alleged bribery , @entity35 said , " it could just be a pay - off ... no quid pro quo			0
" prosecutor @entity58 suggested @entity35 was not interested in shutting down a bad informant : " were n't you more concerned about your own bureaucratic career than rocking the boat ? " trying to discredit @entity35 's story , @entity58 read passages from his book , " betrayal , " in which the former agent recounts events at which he was not present			1
@entity58 accused him of creating " an entire imaginary conversation with @entity71 , " and smirked at the notion @entity73 " taunted " the reputed crime boss			2
although the book is portrayed as " absolutely true , " its copyright page lists it as " fiction			2
" on the stand , @entity35 described it as a " memoir , a recitation of things " he believes happened			0
his goal , he said , was to expose corruption in the @entity3 , which is also , he says , why he resigned : " i did n't want to be part of the corruption			1
" during cross-examination tuesday , @entity35 had difficulty remembering his testimony from the previous day			0
" do you have trouble with your memory ? " the prosecutor asked			2
" not that i recall , " answered @entity35 , drawing some quick laughs from the court			0
@entity6 's defense attorneys called @entity35 as part of their attempt to highlight corruption within the @entity3 during the 1970s and ' 80s			1
another witness testified that rogue @entity3 agent @entity106 had access to all @entity3 informant files and therefore to the identities of everyone cooperating with the government			1
one of them was alleged @entity6 crime associate @entity113			1
@entity35 previously testified he went to strike force attorneys requesting the @entity115 be more diligent about putting @entity113 in witness protection			0
@entity113 was cooperating with law enforcement and had implicated @entity6 in the murder of a wealthy @entity120 business man			1
two days later , @entity35 testified , @entity113 was shot to death			0
@entity6 's former associate @entity122 previously testified that @entity6 fired a machine gun in the hit , along with another shooter			1
pointing to judge @entity127 's portrait in court , @entity58 argued that in 1988 , during hearings before @entity127 , @entity35 could not recall going to the @entity115 to help get @entity113 in witness protection			2
the prosecutor also zeroed in on a passage in the memoir in which @entity35 suggests he was present in 2000 when the body of another alleged @entity6 victim , @entity136 , was pulled from the " frozen ground			1
" despite writing that the image was " etched in my memory , " @entity35 could n't recall whether he was actually there			0
@entity35 was not working for the @entity3 at the time @entity142 's remains were exhumed in 2000			1
" you were trying to take credit for something you did n't do , " @entity143 said			0
the prosecution alleges @entity6 ordered a hit on @entity149 , a fisherman , after learning that @entity142 was cooperating with law enforcement on the investigation of a shipment of arms @entity6 intended to send to the @entity155 on the fishing trawler @entity157			2
@entity142 also tipped authorities to a 36 - ton delivery of marijuana on the boat @entity162 in 1984 , months before he was killed , prosecutors say			0
developer describes threats in trial @entity58 brandished documents in court that showed @entity35 vouched for rogue @entity3 agents during the same time he claims he complained about their behavior			2
@entity35 apparently signed off on glowing @entity3 evaluations of disgraced and now - jailed @entity106 , and even signed off on a recommendation for him to go to a @entity175 program			2
on redirect questioning , @entity35 defended his book to the jury			2
" the book is about the criminal justice system , " he said			2
" in my estimation the criminal justice system failed , it failed during this whole situation			0
i wanted to bring it to light , not just for the public , for my family			0
" @entity35 , who is still fighting to receive the full amount of his pension , plans to write another book on this trial , he said in court			0
jury will not be sequestered despite a request by the defense , judge @entity194 decided tuesday not to sequester the jury , saying this late in the trial the jury was unprepared , and it could be prejudicial to both sides to have a disgruntled jury			2
defense attorney @entity202 previously argued that there has " never been a more widely publicized or sensational case in this district , " saying there has been saturated media coverage and " statements that are so hyperbolic and prejudicial towards the defendant ... unlike anything anyone has seen			1
" the judge said her initial instructions to the jury have been reinforced " more importantly by my repeatedly advising them that they not pay attention to media accounts			0
" she also said she does not expect a " great amount of coverage during deliberations			0
" " we have to assume the jurors are following my instructions , " she said tuesday morning			0
" i am not inclined to inconvenience these jurors at this juncture , " she said , particularly when they have had " no notice " of the potential of sequestration			0
the defense has so far called two of its estimated 15 witnesses			0
it took the prosecution 30 days and 63 witnesses to present its case , which it wrapped up friday .			0
