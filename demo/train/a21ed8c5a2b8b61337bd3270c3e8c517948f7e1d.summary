@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a city slashed by war , a tiger fights for life			1
@entity7 , a @entity9 tiger at the @entity10 , has been suffering for days			1
he is on his side , breathing shallowly , his huge paws motionless -- caramel , black - and - white - striped fur covered with flies that he is too weak to brush off			0
a team of animal - welfare experts from @entity22 's @entity21 gently rolls the tiger over and dr. @entity24 , dripping sweat , searches for a vein , then puts in an iv drip to give the animal vitamins			1
asked why the tiger is so sick , the veterinarian replies , " honestly , we do n't know but i believe he 's old , 21 years			1
number two , it was a lot of stress in the surroundings here			0
" during the struggle for @entity0 , gunfire raged just outside the zoo			1
when the fighting was at its height some @entity1 packed up their cars and fled			1
the animals at the @entity10 did n't have that option			1
the deafening sounds of shooting , the acrid smell of battle -- there was no respite for these sensitive creatures			0
shells still litter the zoo grounds			2
as the zoo 's director , dr. @entity59 , leads a @entity2 crew to the mammal house , he points out bullet casings on the sidewalk			1
" this is for @entity66			0
you know @entity66 ? " he asks , referring to automatic rifles			0
in the mammal house , the roof is marred by a a gaping hole blasted by a rocket propelled grenade			0
luckily , no animal died or was injured			2
for two weeks there was no water in much of @entity0			0
for the hippos at the zoo , it was a disaster			2
the huge , stolid animals stand forlornly by their almost - empty pool , now slowly being filled with water from a large hose			2
@entity59 says that during the worst of it , the animals had to drink whatever water remained but they could not swim , as they usually do			2
the staff had to sprinkle them with what water remained to keep their tough skins moist			0
" they 're shiny now , " he says			0
even as fighters shot it out on the streets near the zoo , 15 members of the staff came in every day to feed and water the animals , risking their own lives ; if they had n't , many of the animals would have died within three to four days , @entity59 says			1
in the tiger house , meanwhile , the animal rescue team still struggles to save @entity7 the tiger			1
dr. @entity24 rushed here from @entity106 to help after seeing @entity2 reports about the fate of these animals			1
he grows more quiet as his efforts seem to have little effect			0
" he 's finished , " he finally whispers , acknowledging that the tiger has died			1
" it was too late			0
" the @entity10 , originally opened in 1986 , was under major reconstruction when the revolution broke out			1
without the fighting , it was scheduled to be completed in may			0
but the @entity119 construction company working on the project pulled out because of security concerns , @entity59 says			0
he hopes the project will continue and says the new @entity124 transitional leaders pledge to give the zoo support			1
there will be exchanges with zoos around the world , he says , something that stopped during the @entity132 regime			0
he will be able to attend conferences around the world , to learn new techniques of protecting animals in captivity			2
and , he predicts , the zoo will welcome new animals unscarred by war .			2

animal experts from @entity22 saw @entity2 reports on the @entity10 and rushed to help
animals at the zoo suffered as gun battles raged in the city
the zoo 's director says @entity1 's new leaders pledge to give the zoo support
but for one tiger , the fight for *survival* is lost
