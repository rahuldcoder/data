@entity0 , the former @entity1 intelligence agent who was convicted of spying for @entity2 , could be released before the @entity4 holiday of @entity5 as part of efforts to save @entity2 - @entity9 peace negotiations , an @entity2 official involved in the talks told @entity12			1
suggestions for deals for @entity0 's release have been floated over the years but have not materialized			2
@entity5 starts on april 14			0
talk of @entity0 's possible release came as secretary of state @entity18 traveled to @entity2 on monday to try to mediate a dispute between @entity2 and the @entity9 over the release of @entity9 prisoners			1
@entity18 was in @entity22 on tuesday			2
he was expected to go back to @entity2 on wednesday and to visit @entity23 , @entity24 , but a senior @entity26 official told @entity12 that trip is no longer happening			1
@entity18 stated tuesday night that " no agreement has been reached with respect to any prisoner " -- be it @entity0 , whom he was asked about , or anyone else -- though talks involving all parties are ongoing in hopes of reaching a broader agreement			1
" at this point in time , no agreement has been reached with respect to any prisoner , not even the ones that at this moment are at issue in terms of the transfer			2
the @entity45 in @entity2 has to vote			2
i 'm not sure exactly when that might take place or not			0
so there is no agreement at this point in time regarding anyone , or any specific steps , there are a lot of different possibilities in play , " @entity18 said			2
" it is difficult , it is emotional , it requires huge decisions , some of them with great political difficulty , " he continued			0
" ... we are continuing , even now ... to find the best way forward			0
" @entity66 spokesman @entity65 said tuesday that president @entity67 has n't decided whether to release the convicted spy at @entity2 's request			1
" the @entity2 frequently raise this issue , and they have raised this issue in our discussions , " @entity65 said			2
" beyond that , i 'm not going to get ahead of the work that secretary @entity18 is doing and the conversations that he 's having			2
" @entity0 's possible release was being discussed as part of a broader agreement that has not been finalized , according to sources familiar with the talks			1
in exchange for the release , the sources have said that @entity2 would have to make significant concessions to the @entity9 , which could include a settlement freeze , the release of additional prisoners beyond the current group in dispute and an agreement to continue peace negotiations beyond the end - of - april deadline			1
@entity0 was convicted in 1987 of spying for @entity2 and is serving a life sentence in the @entity1			1
his imprisonment has been a source of tension between the @entity1 and @entity2			1
27 years later , @entity0 case remains a diplomatic thorn parameters the @entity2 official said the parameters of a deal still emerging include negotiations with the @entity9 continuing into 2015 , and an agreement that during that time , @entity9 would refrain from taking their case to international bodies			1
however , @entity106 , a @entity9 lawmaker who met monday with @entity108 president @entity107 to discuss @entity18 's efforts , said the @entity9 leadership believes the @entity2 are making claims of an " emerging deal " to create an impression that a breakthrough is imminent so that when it falls apart , it can be blamed on the @entity9			1
@entity106 doubted the notion that the @entity9 were on the verge of signing a deal and said @entity107 is increasingly convinced that @entity2 is not interested in any process that would lead to @entity9 statehood			1
according to the @entity2 official , though , a fourth @entity9 prisoner release would go ahead and would include @entity2 arabs , the official added			1
an additional 400 @entity9 prisoners would be released			0
@entity2 would determine those to be released , and they would not have blood on their hands , the official added			0
regarding settlements , there would not be a total freeze , but " @entity2 will act with great restraint , " he said			0
but in what one nongovernmental organization 's director called " a blow to the @entity1 efforts in trying to achieve an agreement between the @entity2 and @entity9 , " @entity2 pushed forward tuesday with tenders for new settlement construction in @entity141 , in @entity142			1
" @entity2 today re-announced pushed tenders for 708 new settlement units in @entity141 that were originally published in november , " said @entity143 , director of @entity144 , an @entity2 ngo that monitors @entity2 's settlement construction in the @entity24 and @entity142			2
the @entity2 official said @entity142 would not be included in the provision calling for no tenders for new housing in the @entity24 , although work would proceed on tenders already issued , the official said			0
the halt on new tenders refers to housing only			0
construction of other infrastructure , such as roads and hospitals , he said , would continue			0
asked about the talks and a possible release , @entity161 , a spokesman for @entity162 , said the committee was not " reacting to the news			0
" " their message all along has been that @entity0 should have been freed a long time ago and this should be an outcome of justice in the @entity1 legal system , " he said			1
separately , a spokesman for cabinet minister @entity174 confirmed he had said he was against the release of " murderers " in exchange for @entity0			0
opinion : trade a spy , get @entity182 peace ? parole consideration @entity2 has in the past tried to link @entity0 's release to peace negotiations			1
current and former @entity1 officials and experts have suggested the @entity1 government might tie his release to a comprehensive peace deal between the @entity2 and @entity9			1
@entity0 is up for parole consideration in november 2015 , and the @entity1 is running out of time to use his possible release for leverage with @entity2			1
@entity65 , the @entity66 spokesman , said on monday that it is a " complicated issue " and declined to " get into details " about the negotiations			0
" and with regards to mr. @entity0 , he is a person who was convicted of espionage and is serving his sentence , and i do n't have any update on his situation , " @entity65 said			2
but the fact the @entity1 is apparently willing to discuss his release before even a framework agreement has been reached between the parties shows the extraordinary efforts @entity209 is making to salvage the troubled negotiations			2
when asked whether @entity0 was a topic in @entity18 's talks with @entity2 prime minister @entity214 , @entity26 spokeswoman @entity211 stuck to the @entity66 line and said she had no updates on his status			1
talks hit a snag the peace negotiations , which began in july , have hit a snag over whether @entity2 will agree to release more than two dozen prisoners , including 14 @entity223 whom @entity2 considers terrorists			0
they were scheduled to be freed on march 29 , and now @entity9 negotiators are threatening to end the negotiations over the delay			0
@entity2 has already released three groups of prisoners , most of whom have served lengthy prison terms for attacks on @entity2			0
but this final release is especially contentious because it includes convicted murderers			0
@entity214 has said he would seek approval for any further releases with his cabinet , which has been critical of the previous releases			0
@entity2 deputy defense minister @entity242 told @entity12 he will resign if @entity2 goes ahead with the prisoner release , and other @entity245 members in the @entity45 , along with members of the @entity247 , which has 12 members in the @entity249 , could join him , creating a political crisis			1
@entity214 has also said he would not release any more prisoners if @entity107 did not agree to continue negotiations and to stop threatening to seek recognition for @entity9 before international bodies			0
a new possible stumbling block in the overall talks arose tuesday , when @entity107 signed 15 requests to have his government join international organizations , according to @entity9 lawmaker @entity106			1
asked about this development , @entity18 said none of the organizations that @entity107 asked to join " involved the @entity261 " furthermore , he scuttled any thought that this could derail negotiations while insisting that the key players remain engaged			0
the @entity1 is ready and willing to play a significant role , @entity18 said			2
still , @entity18 stressed that it 's the @entity2 and @entity9 who will ultimately decide if a deal gets done			1
" in the end , this is up to the parties , " he said			0
" ... the leaders have to make the decisions			0
" opinion : the truth about @entity0			0

@entity18 says there 's " no agreement " with regards to any prisoner
@entity0 is a former @entity1 intelligence agent convicted of spying for @entity2
