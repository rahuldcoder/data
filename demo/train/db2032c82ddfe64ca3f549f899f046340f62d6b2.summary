@entity1 @entity0 found his life 's calling after witnessing a tragic scene as a young boy that still haunts him decades later			1
the pioneering @entity10 doctor was just nine years old when a girl was rushed across the border from southern @entity13 to northern @entity10			1
a few years his senior , she was severely dehydrated and barely holding on			2
" everyone was trying to resuscitate her and my uncle , a local pharmacy technician , saw the horrified look on my face			2
i was just a terrified kid , so he took me home			2
" but @entity0 could n't get the girl off his mind			1
he persuaded his uncle to let him return to the hospital a few weeks later to see the girl			0
he was amazed to find she had nearly made a full recovery -- something that would inspire him to help others later in life			0
" another human being managed to bring her back to life and i should also be able to do the same if i try my best , " he recalls thinking			0
though friends and family laughed off @entity0 's interest in medicine , his mother voiced her support			1
" you know , these guys have never seen a black doctor before , " she said at the time			0
looking back , @entity0 admits their reaction was n't too surprising			1
he was , after all , living in a rural part of @entity10 where nomads form most of the population			1
but he refused to let that stand in the way of pursuing his dream -- a journey that has taken him far away from his ancestral home and , eventually , to the @entity54			0
medical milestone @entity0 is currently based in @entity56 , @entity57 , near @entity58 , and best known as a pioneer in endoscopic spine surgery			1
patients , who are usually required to spend days in hospital , can often walk out of his clinic just hours after surgery			1
a fellow doctor from @entity66 became the world 's first patient to undergo one of @entity0 's endoscopic spine surgeries in the mid 1990s			1
he had the first ever endoscopic thoracic decompression and fusion as an outpatient			2
a medical milestone , it was the culmination of several years of research			0
he called @entity77 three days after his surgery declaring : " it 's the first time in four years that i 'm able to stand on one leg while putting on my pants			2
" but back surgery does n't come without serious risks			2
patients undergoing a currently popular minimally invasive surgery ( direct lateral approach for lumbar spinal fusion ) face a complication risk of up to 67 %			1
moreover , such procedures often result in some form of nerve damage			0
@entity0 is able to dramatically reduce those numbers by drilling a hole through the pelvic bone			1
this allows him to access the injured lowest lumbar disc while avoiding damage to spinal muscles or entry into the spinal canal , where nerves can be injured			2
it also does n't involve access through the abdomen			0
the procedure is called trans - iliac approach to lumbosacral junction			2
hundreds of surgeries later , @entity0 says he still has n't come across any side effects in patients			1
he does , however , explain that the method still is n't common in the @entity54 , or around the world			2
this has n't stopped @entity0 from sharing his groundbreaking technique with others			1
now , more surgeons are embracing the approach as they become more familiar with it			0
" it 's my duty to tell the medical community to look at my technique if they truly have the patient 's best interest at heart			0
" he recently released the first clinical result of the approach , while the original study was published in the " @entity128 " in 1997			0
he also introduced a technique called endoscopic foraminal decompression the same year			2
doctors as far away as @entity132 and @entity133 are now practicing the method			0
dr. @entity135 is best known as the former president of the @entity137 and techniques ( @entity139 )			0
he says @entity0 's approach is growing rapidly in popularity among spine specialists around the world -- who are now using the procedure on a routine basis			1
" these are highly specialized surgeons , " explains @entity135 , who currently heads up the @entity147 and @entity148			0
from rural @entity10 boy to world - renowned surgeon @entity0 was born and raised in @entity152 , a place he describes as " a small , but cosmopolitan market town between @entity13 and @entity10			1
" people from different ethnic and religious backgrounds lived together in harmony -- something he says was unusual for a region largely divided into tribal areas			0
each level of education @entity0 completed took him further and further away from his family			1
i moved forward knowing everything was helping me reach my goal			2
i also began seeing black doctors the closer i got to @entity168			0
" he trained at @entity169 , the country 's largest healthcare treatment facility			0
it was n't long before word of his success reached local communities in @entity152 and those needing medical attention sought out his help in @entity168			0
while treating them was a very fulfilling experience , @entity0 grew frustrated , as he was n't able to cater to everyone 's needs			1
this , coupled with the need to complete his post-graduate education , eventually led to his decision to leave @entity10			1
he was accepted to @entity188 's prestigious @entity187 in 1980			0
" i 'm @entity10 wherever i go in the world and nothing can ever change that , " @entity0 told @entity190 's head of surgery , who was sad to see his favorite student go			1
@entity0 eventually relocated to the @entity54 where foreign doctors must get recertified to practice medicine			1
" i wanted to advance technology in spine surgery , but how can i do that while i 'm doing internships for the next three to four years ? so i asked myself , where will the world of spine surgery be ten years from now ? " predicting the future allowed @entity0 to spearhead cutting - edge medical procedures while still transitioning to working as a doctor in the @entity54 inspiring the next generation some 30 years later , his success story appears to have inspired a new generation of high achievers in his rural hometown			1
@entity0 explains his village in @entity152 at one point produced the highest number of doctors , veterinary surgeons , nurses and engineers per capita in @entity220			1
he remembers receiving an email from a young man about 10 years ago			0
it turned out he came from the same village and was studying electrical engineering in @entity226			0
" he said if there was no @entity0 , i probably would n't be here			1
i felt tears running down my cheeks and realized that i 've achieved what i set out to do			0
to lead by example , so others can use their potential to get more out of life			0
" @entity0 's ultimate ambition is to produce an artificial skeleton , which mimics a natural one as closely as technology allows			1
that goal could already be well within his reach			2
he has patents for growing artificial bones and joints -- as well as replacing damaged discs in the spine with biologic materials			1
" i still see that 12 - year - old girl in front of me , " he says			2
" that 's who i 'm treating every day			0
if my patients are smiling , then i have achieved my dream			0
" more from @entity257 voices			0
