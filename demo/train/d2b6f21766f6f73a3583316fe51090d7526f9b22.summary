some say it 's the most famous , perfectly composed news photo of all time			1
monday marks 70 years since @entity3 captured the iconic picture of five @entity6 @entity5 and a @entity8 sailor raising an @entity6 flag over the battle - scarred @entity11 island of @entity12			1
the image was so inspiring that , by 1945 standards , it went viral			2
it triggered a wave of national hope that @entity11 forces would soon be crushed and peace was near			2
it spurred millions of @entity6 to buy war bonds to keep the nation on solid financial footing			1
basically , this simple photo was so powerful it helped win @entity25 but @entity3 was just one of several cameramen on the island 's @entity27 that day			1
their images reveal the entire story behind the famous picture			1
they provide clues into the anger and ugly rumors over whether the @entity38 - winning photo was staged			1
@entity39 , a former executive newsphoto editor at the @entity40 , knew @entity3			1
@entity41 shared with @entity0 the inside story surrounding the photo			1
" the most surprising thing to me is ... that even today there are many people who believe that the picture was posed , " @entity41 said			2
" it still comes up over and over again			2
" social media follow @ @entity50 on @entity51 to join the conversation about photography			2
on february 23 , 1945 , @entity3 , an @entity40 photographer covering the battle for @entity12 , had heard @entity5 were headed up the mountain			1
he decided to make the climb and see what was going on			2
but sgt. @entity58 , a @entity5 photographer for @entity59 , had beat him to it			2
@entity58 was already on the summit snapping photos of @entity5 proudly raising the @entity6 flag			1
for miles around , the sight of @entity65 atop the mountain set off whistles , gunfire and celebrations			2
the noise stirred up a firefight with @entity11 soldiers near the summit			2
@entity58 dove for cover and fell 50 feet , smashing his camera			2
@entity58 decided to descend the mountain to get new equipment			2
on the way , he ran into @entity3 coming up with two @entity5 : @entity80			2
@entity81 , who was also a photographer , and sgt. @entity82 , who was a motion picture photographer			0
according to @entity41 , @entity58 said , " hey , you 're late fellas , there 's already a flag up there			1
" @entity58 told @entity3 that he should keep going to experience the breathtaking view			0
as @entity3 got closer to the summit , the flag began to come into view			1
" he stopped and was struck by a wave of emotion about what it cost to put that flag up there , " @entity41 said			1
@entity3 thought about all the bloody fighting and the @entity5 who sacrificed their lives to capture the mountain			1
reaching the top , @entity3 , @entity81 and @entity82 spotted a group of @entity5 holding a second flag			1
the @entity5 said they 'd been ordered to replace the first flag with a bigger one so more people could see it below			1
suddenly @entity3 knew he had a second chance to photograph an important moment on the summit			0
let 's stop a minute and remember that this was long before today 's sophisticated cameras and digital technology			0
photographers took one picture at a time , often with only one opportunity to get the perfect shot			0
@entity3 had to quickly decide whether to shoot both flags simultaneously -- one rising while the other lowered -- or to photograph the second flag as it was being raised			1
he chose to focus on the second flag			1
@entity3 's choice made all the difference			0
" @entity3 did not pose that picture , " @entity41 said			0
he explains what happened : " while the photographers were taking their positions to get the shot , @entity82 -- the motion picture photographer -- asked @entity3 , " i 'm not in your way , am i ? ' @entity3 turned to look at @entity125 , who suddenly saw the flag rising and said , ' hey , there she goes ! ' " @entity136 came the flag			1
just in time , @entity3 raised his camera to his eye and took the shot			0
there it was : a genuine moment in history , artfully captured for all time			0
" like any good , experienced and talented photographer , there 's a sense of anticipation and a sense of shooting a picture at peak action -- and @entity3 got it , " @entity41 said			0
" you could n't have captured the action at a better peak			0
a moment earlier , and the flag would have been too low			1
if it had been a second later , the flag 's staff would have been straight up and the photo would n't have had that strong diagonal line			1
" this is our cue to talk about the photo 's amazing composition			1
" it 's exquisite , " @entity41 said			0
" you have this strong , diagonal line made by the flag staff			1
you have the flag snapping in the breeze			1
you have the pyramid - like shape of the @entity5 pushing the flag up			1
the men obviously are separate , but they appear as one			0
the blank background enhances the action by providing no distractions			0
also , the photo is gifted with a softly filtered light			1
a very thin haze of clouds filters the light so that the shadows are n't harsh , but there is detail in all the shadows on the uniforms and the flag			1
" think about it : at the exact moment that @entity82 cued @entity3 , sunlight , shadows , wind and the @entity5 all converged perfectly			0
what were the chances ? " i hate to use the word accident , " @entity41 joked			0
" let 's call it serendipity			0
" but what about @entity58 's flag photo ? how was the composition of his image ? " it was perfectly serviceable , " @entity41 said , because it showed the first flag			1
the photo shows a @entity5 in the foreground holding a rifle			1
in the background is the first flag , snapping in the breeze			1
but it 's just not a memorable picture , @entity41 said , which is likely why it never gained fame			0
it did n't have the same powerful visual message and photographic excellence of @entity3 's image			0
" there 's just no comparison , " @entity41 said			0
" i mean , we 're talking about the difference between diamonds and glass			0
" on the other hand , @entity3 's " picture captured the heroism of the whole @entity25 , " @entity41 said			0
" it captured a moment during a ferocious battle and it looked to the future -- to victory and the end of the war			0
" in fact , the image was so good that critics accused @entity3 of staging it -- a myth he fought for more than 60 years			0
the rumor started for a good reason			0
@entity3 actually did stage a photo on the summit			2
but the photo he posed was a different picture that was taken after the famous flag - raising			1
in the staged photo , @entity5 posed in front of the flag , victoriously holding their helmets and rifles in the air			1
that image is referred to as @entity3 's " @entity258 " @entity12 photo			1
before he even saw his photos , @entity3 sent his film by plane to @entity263 , where it was developed and edited			0
the famous photo was transmitted by radiofax to @entity267 before it was shared with newspapers across the nation and around the world			1
when @entity58 saw @entity3 's photo , @entity58 " was pissed off , " @entity41 said			2
@entity58 had missed the second flag - raising , so he did n't know what happened			1
all he knew was that @entity3 's photo was on the front page of virtually every newspaper in @entity6 , and @entity58 's photo was being ignored			1
@entity58 alleged that @entity3 's picture must have been posed			0
according to @entity41 , " someone asked @entity3 if he posed his picture , and @entity3 -- thinking they meant the ' @entity258 ' photo -- said yes			2
" minutes later , @entity3 realized what photo they were talking about and immediately tried to correct his error			2
any journalist knows that " the correction never catches up with the error , " @entity41 said			0
" @entity3 spent the rest of his life defending what was alleged as a ' phony picture			0
' " it took a special meeting in @entity294 between military officials and editors at @entity297 and @entity40 to put the controversy to rest			1
" they came to the conclusion that the picture was not posed , " @entity41 said			0
" it was an authentic news picture of the second flag being raised			2
" years later , @entity3 and @entity58 settled their differences			0
during a @entity5 event somewhere in the @entity309 , they reunited in a hotel room where they shared a bottle of bourbon , @entity41 said			0
afterward , @entity58 acknowledged @entity3 's picture was not posed			0
" he said it was an honest - to - @entity316 picture and they remained friends , " @entity41 said			0
" in fact , @entity3 attended @entity58 's funeral when he died			0
" before @entity3 died in 2006 at age 94 , he told @entity41 he never got over the controversy			0
it always annoyed him -- " the same charges and allegations over and over , " @entity41 said			0
the picture has become almost an unofficial symbol of the @entity5 and @entity328			0
the @entity5 embraced it by transforming the photo into a memorial statue in @entity332 , @entity333			2
@entity335 movies have been made about the flag - raising			1
the @entity337 featured it on a stamp			0
even the shape of the @entity341 , in @entity342 , @entity333 , was inspired by @entity3 's photo			2
@entity41 said that as @entity3 looked back on his life , he was glad his photo came to represent the bravery and sacrifice of the men he called " my @entity5			2

many thought the famous photo of @entity6 troops raising the flag at @entity12 was staged
