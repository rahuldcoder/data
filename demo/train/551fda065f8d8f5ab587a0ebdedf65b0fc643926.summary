ah , @entity0 -- poster boy for the anti-government , rugged - individualist crowd			1
the @entity3 for the conservative fantasy world			0
@entity0 is so bizarre he leaves late night comedians spluttering			1
( just check out one of @entity8 's riffs			0
) his comments about race were so embarrassing that @entity11 , who had called @entity0 " a friend and frequent guest of the show , " had to do a " protest too much " denouncement			1
yes , @entity11 called @entity0 's words " beyond repugnant " -- but only after first promoting him as a patriot par excellence			1
@entity23 office - holders , such as sen. @entity24 , @entity25 , and sen. @entity26 , @entity27 , who had been cheerleading @entity0 and his rabble also had to distance themselves , many of them fumbling with their rhetorical pom - poms in the process			1
here 's the basic background : @entity0 is a wealthy @entity30 rancher who believes he has " beneficial use " claim to grazing lands owned by the federal government			1
ownership of the land is not a matter of dispute			2
@entity0 has been in and out of protracted court battles for decades , and he 's lost every time			1
in 1993 , @entity0 stopped paying the grazing fees for using federal @entity42 land			1
his fees accumulated to $ 1 million			2
finally , after two courts ruled in the bureau 's favor , it moved to seize @entity0 's cattle , planning to sell them at auction to pay for the 20 years ' worth of grazing fees			1
on april 5 , the bureau brought in armed federal agents and began removing @entity0 's cattle			1
@entity0 's son @entity54 was arrested for refusing to leave			1
that night , @entity0 sent a message : " they have my cattle and now they have one of my boys			1
" visions of the @entity62 , anyone ? frontier justice ? or not			0
@entity0 's supporters rallied around him , traveling from out of state			2
that 's when the bizarre started			0
@entity68 , a former @entity69 sheriff , said , " we 're actually strategizing to put all the women up at the front			0
if they are going to start shooting , it 's going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers			0
" how 's that for a jaw - dropper ? the standoff lasted a week , until the bureau announced on april 12 that it would return the seized cattle because of its " grave concern about the safety of employees and members of the public			0
" conservatives and @entity23 cheered			2
well , not all of them			0
you see , @entity0 based his claim that he did not have to pay the grazing fees because -- well , here are his words : " i believe this is a sovereign state of @entity30			1
and i abide by all @entity30 state laws			0
but i do n't recognize the @entity100 government as even existing			0
you see , @entity0 is violating the @entity102 , and therefore the state 's laws			2
@entity105 1 , section 2 of that state 's constitution reads , in part : " ... the @entity110 of every citizen is due to the @entity112 ... and no power exists in the people of this or any other @entity116 to dissolve their connection therewith ... " conservative columnist @entity118 told @entity119 : " this is a man who said that he does n't recognize the authority of the @entity100			0
that makes him a patriot ? i love this country , i love the @entity125 , and it is the @entity125 that established a government that all of us have to recognize			0
and for him to reject it was the beginning of all of this			0
and now what he said today is just the end of this			0
" that 's the point			0
we can disagree about policies and politics , and even whether baseball or football is " @entity100 's sport			0
" hopefully we 'll again get to a place in our civic discourse where we can be civil and compromise for the common good , to move toward that " more perfect @entity147 " the @entity125 mentions			0
but denying the very existence of the @entity100 ? still , that 's not what had other @entity23 and conservative pontificators going , " oops			2
" it was @entity0 's obscene , racist remarks : " and because they [ @entity156 ] were basically on government subsidy , so now what do they do ? they abort their young children , they put their young men in jail , because they never learned how to pick cotton			1
and i 've often wondered , are they better off as slaves , picking cotton and having a family life and doing things , or are they better off under government subsidy ? they did n't get no more freedom			1
" that 's why republicans are distancing themselves from @entity0			2
because @entity0 's words destroy their argument that we should n't talk about race			2
@entity0 's remarks , following so closely on the @entity183 's @entity182 decision , refute chief justice @entity186 ' misguided insistence that " racism will end when we stop helping minorities " and prove justice @entity189 right when she says that the act of ignoring pervasive structural racism is an abdication of judicial responsibility			2
thanks to the federal government and men and women of valor who fought for those words written in our @entity125 , we can have this debate			1
and it is that same constitution that gives even a racist idiot like @entity0 freedom to spew his lunacy while riding his horse and waving his @entity100 flag , even if some @entity23 now pretend they 've never heard of the guy			1
join us on @entity212 / @entity211 .			0

@entity214 looks at the furor around @entity216 and wonders if @entity23 are in denial
@entity0 has been in a dispute over grazing fees he owes to the federal government
@entity0 made comments recently saying that *blacks* were better off as slaves " picking cotton "
