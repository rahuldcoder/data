@entity0 , @entity1 -- i am @entity1 born and raised , and i come from a long line of coal miners			1
my father , grandfather , brothers , husband and son - in - law either are or were coal miners			1
my husband spent 35 years as an underground union coal miner and he died of black lung			1
i live near @entity15 and my community is experiencing a tragedy			2
the situation here , before this disaster , had already compelled me to become an environmental activist , committed to doing everything i can to stop the destructive practice of coal extraction known as mountaintop removal			1
i am not trying to stop all coal mining			1
i believe coal mining will be with us for a very long time , considering our enormous thirst for energy and our slow transition to renewable energy			1
throughout @entity33 , 2,000 miles of headwater streams have been destroyed and over 500 mountains have been decapitated by mountaintop removal			1
i stood by and did nothing until @entity37 brought this fight to my door			1
three years ago , @entity37 applied for a permit to blow the top off the mountain behind my house			1
the company plans to level 6,600 acres of @entity15 and turn it into a moonscape where no living , breathing thing can survive			0
i believe a higher and better use for this mountain is the @entity51			0
on monday , april 5 , an enormous explosion went off at the @entity54 mine at @entity55 , a subsidiary of @entity37			1
thirty - one men in our community did n't come home that day			2
we do n't yet know the names of all of the deceased and i dread the day when the list is read and we , at last , know our connection to those who did n't make it			0
i felt extremely blessed when i knew that my family members who worked at this mine were home and safe			0
i know many friends and neighbors will be among those we lost and i grieve for all of the families involved			0
on april 6 , many heartbroken and terrified families kissed their loved ones at the door and sent them off back to work underground			2
these very brave men enter these mines knowing their fate will probably be the same as their friends ' on april 5 or the same as my husband 's			1
now , although these very proud , brave and strong men make about $ 70,000 a year , if they had a choice , many of them would never go underground again			2
the problem is that we live in a mono - economy and there are no choices			0
the coal industry has a death grip in the state of @entity1 and we have some of the best politicians money can buy			0
we also have some very honest , good and environmentally friendly politicians			0
their numbers are small and it is considered to be political suicide to do anything in @entity1 that appears to be anti-coal			0
many of our representatives have tunnel vision and refuse to advocate for job diversity in the coal fields			0
coal is a finite resource , and no matter when you think , it will eventually run out -- someday we will have harvested all of the economically feasible coal			0
when that day comes , how will the people we love support their families ? i live at ground zero for mountaintop removal and because of the stand that i and many other people have taken to stop it , tensions run high in the coal fields			1
we are all being used by an outlaw industry and corrupt politicians and we are all driven by fear			0
the men who work in surface mining are terrified they will lose their jobs			1
i am terrified that my granddaughter will not have clean drinking water when she is of child - bearing age if we do n't stop this			2
@entity37 's record speaks for itself			2
with an enormous amount of violations and previous deaths at this mine , i will leave it to you to decide if this company puts profits before the safety of its workers or views its employees as a disposable commodity			1
we are coping with this enormous tragedy , and sometimes tragedy brings communities together			0
i can only hope that something good will come out of all of this bad			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			2
