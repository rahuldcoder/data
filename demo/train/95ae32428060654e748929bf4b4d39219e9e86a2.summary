it is nighttime as a pack of masked soldiers silently moves toward the front line of a deadly shootout between law enforcement officials and unknown men in a dimly lit @entity8 neighborhood			1
but the soldiers are too late to prevent the grisly scene that awaits them			0
one of their own is on the ground , seriously wounded			0
one of the attackers is dead , and three others have been shot			0
" they did n't even say a word			0
they just pulled out their weapons and started shooting at our soldiers , " army commander @entity18 said of the scene , which has become all too familiar in @entity8 ' second - largest city			2
@entity26 oversees a unit of soldiers , often masked to protect their identities , who patrol the streets of @entity32 , the so - called murder capital of the world			1
photos : deadly violence grips @entity8 for the second straight year , @entity32 , in northwest @entity8 , has topped a list of the world 's 50 most violent cities , with a rate of 169 intentional homicides per 100,000 inhabitants -- an average of more than three people every day			1
the report , compiled by the @entity46 think tank @entity47 , compared intentional homicide statistics around the world in 2012			1
the report does not include cities in the @entity52			2
the sunny beach resort of @entity54 in @entity46 ranked second on the group 's list , followed by the @entity58 capital of @entity59			1
@entity60 is the murder capital of the @entity62 , according to the report , which ranked the city 17th on the list			1
@entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 were the other @entity62 cities to make the list			0
@entity73 's bloody drug problem @entity32 's challenge , experts say , is that @entity46 's offensive against drug cartels and the active @entity62 deportation of criminal immigrants are pushing the problem south			1
some of this criminal element has ended up in @entity8 , where , like most @entity73 countries , law enforcement has few resources to fight it			2
but city residents say that " murder capital of the world " is an undeserved label that is hurting local businesses			1
there are only three morgues in @entity8 , and one of them is in @entity32			1
residents say that people who are murdered elsewhere and then taken to the city 's morgue are being grouped into the city 's crime statistics			0
" all of the crimes that happen in northern @entity8 are registered as happening here , " businessman @entity101 said			2
" so what we businessmen are doing is an accurate count to determine where crime or violent deaths originate so that the information is truthful			0
" the @entity111 said that only people murdered in @entity32 were tallied in the group 's report -- and that in fact the actual murder rate in the city is even higher			1
the authors of the report defended their research on the group 's website , writing : it " is not the ranking that damages the image of the city but the violence and the government 's inability to contain and reduce it			0
to hide the problems never solves them			0
" @entity8 is far from the only country in the region with a murder problem			2
the top 10 -- and 39 of 50 overall -- most violent cities on the list are @entity137			0
authorities have launched @entity139 in @entity32 , saturating violence hotspots with police and soldiers , and some residents believe the beefed - up security is working			2
" there 's more security now , " said local resident @entity145			0
" and that gives us peace			0
" unfortunately , at least so far , the measures seem to have had little impact on the murder rate .			1

@entity32 , @entity8 , named murder capital of world for second straight year
@entity54 and @entity59 come second and third , respectively , in @entity46 think tank report
