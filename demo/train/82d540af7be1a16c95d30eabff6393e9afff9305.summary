i 've always wanted to go to @entity1 , having often heard that it was a magical place of extraordinary architecture and history ( especially since it mostly escaped bombing during @entity6 )			2
finally , in the week leading up to @entity7 , with visions of castles dancing in our heads , my girlfriend @entity12 and i flew in to begin our central @entity14 adventure			2
we had only one fear : we 're vegans			1
would we find anything to eat that contained absolutely no animal products , or would we be reduced to subsisting on doughy rolls and plain salads ? i 'm happy to report that @entity1 not only surpassed my imagination with its stunning vistas , medieval bridges and palatial grandeur , it turns out to be chock full of fabulous vegan and vegetarian restaurants			1
in fact , @entity27 in general is a hotbed of vegetarianism			1
who knew ? do n't fear the vegan ! it turns out that @entity34 knew			1
i have long used the @entity36 app in the @entity37 to find vegan restaurants			1
but i had low expectations when i clicked on the app in @entity1 , seeking the closest vegan or vegetarian restaurants			1
my assumptions were way off			0
it turns out @entity1 is a mecca of compassionate living with well over a dozen choices popping up : either vegan , vegetarian or veg - friendly			1
within a 10 - minute cobblestone - laden stroll from the historic @entity51 , which dates to the 14th century and overlooks the @entity52 , we were delighted to encounter @entity53 , an ironic name given that we climbed three flights of candlelit stairs to get to it			1
it was worth the hike for the delicious vegan burger made of red beets , chickpeas , tempeh and gherkin			1
the staff is clearly in it for the cause of compassion , hence their motto : " we give food a higher meaning			0
" we liked it so much we came back again and tried the baked beetroot carpaccio			0
next stop : @entity76 , a storybook medieval city whose historic center is a @entity80 and sits about halfway between @entity1 and @entity81			0
surely , i thought , there 's no way we 'll find vegan options in this place			1
wrong again ! this was actually the site of one of our favorite vegetarian restaurants : @entity92			2
sitting on sturdy wooden tables in an open terrace on the banks of the river , we stared up at the famed castle that was started in the 13th century but expanded over time to embrace not just @entity100 but @entity101 and @entity102 styles			0
meanwhile , we nibbled on a vegan sampler for two that included @entity106 , @entity107 and traditional @entity14 flavors			2
6 veggie burgers so good you wo n't miss the meat our waiter was fluent in several languages , and we even bantered in @entity113 for a while			2
it was a magical blending of cultures and centuries at the crossroads of time and taste			0
for a pick - me - up during sightseeing , we sampled the addictive potato swirls sold by a street vendor -- something akin to a medieval order of fries			1
for the piece de resistance , it was off to @entity81			0
would the home of @entity131 and @entity132 have some compassion in its high culture stew ? @entity135 naturlich ! in fact , there were so many vegan options , we hit @entity139 , an ice cream store that features several vegan flavors , for a cone of mindblowing vegan chocolate ice cream even before hitting our main meal ! good thing we were walking at least 5 miles a day			1
then , we discovered @entity146 1 nestled in a small courtyard just a short walk from the historic @entity149 in the heart of @entity81			0
the few outdoor tables were taken , but everyone seated at them generously invited us to join them			0
when we asked for a menu , a friendly lady in an apron pointed to the chalkboard , and we realized that there was a single offering of the day			0
so we each ordered the macrobiotic plate that featured sweet sauteed pumpkin , delicious quinoa , lentils and salad			0
it really felt like we were having a meal with a local family			0
we chatted with the others about @entity170 , the new vegan supermarket chain sweeping @entity27			1
it made me realize , being vegan is like being a member of a compassionate club where you can find a haven with your fellows anywhere in the world			2
all of our vegan adventures were memorable			2
but the one that will always stand out was our lunch at the sumptuous @entity186 , a white glove vegetarian restaurant near @entity81 's renowned @entity188			0
using our @entity190 app to find a spot out of the rain , we had no idea we were stepping into the fanciest vegetarian experience of our lives			1
i 'm talking palate cleansers , hand towels and a suggestion to allow at least an hour and a half for the full experience			0
what a treat : vegan caviar served up in vintage tins , followed by mouth - watering combinations of carefully sculpted vegetables			1
finally , our dessert featured perhaps the most succulent brownie i 've ever tasted			0
@entity12 had strawberry dumplings that were almost too beautiful to eat			0
we devoured every last bite			0
on our last day , before tackling the massive and astounding @entity211 and its sweeping gardens , we filled up at @entity213 , which offered a buffet of hearty plant - based dishes from red lentils with millet , apples , spinach and radicchio to eggplant with pomegranate , pine nuts and basil			2
finally , for a last dessert before heading back to low - calorie reality , we hit a small shop on a @entity81 side street called @entity228			1
we wanted to find that classic , light @entity81 puff pastry , and we did in the form of mini-cupcakes			0
our vegan adventure added so much flavor and excitement to our trip			2
it got us off the beaten path and into the nooks and crannies where real people live			1
we got a real taste of what life in @entity27 is really like .			1

@entity27 might not seem like a hotbed of vegan options , but it is
apps like @entity36 and @entity190 led the author off the beaten path
vegetables are n't just an *afterthought* at these restaurants ; they 're the star
options range from street snacks to high - end dining
