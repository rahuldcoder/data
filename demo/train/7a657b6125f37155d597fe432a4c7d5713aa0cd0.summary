@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 has won a major victory in its long court battle with a @entity7 - based deep - sea salvage company over rights to an estimated $ 500 million in silver and gold coins , officials said wednesday			1
the treasure was recovered in 2007 from a 19th century sunken ship off the @entity1 coast			1
the 11th @entity15 @entity14 in @entity16 on tuesday turned aside another motion from the @entity15 - based company , @entity18 , and @entity1 officials said they now expect the coins -- nearly 600,000 of them -- to arrive in @entity1 soon			1
" with the ruling by the appeals court , the process begins to recover all of the coins taken illegally " from the sunken ship , @entity1 's @entity21 said in a statement			2
@entity18 , which can still appeal to the @entity15 @entity27 , said in a statement , " currently , no final order has been issued in the case and it would be premature to comment at this time			0
" the battle royal began after @entity18 announced in 2007 it had found the sunken treasure			0
it quickly laid claim to the coins , put them in crates and said it flew them to a discreet , well - guarded location in the @entity15			1
@entity1 soon filed suit in a federal court in @entity42 , @entity7 , also claiming the treasure			1
@entity1 says its navy warship @entity45 was carrying the coins			2
the @entity45 , a 34 - gun frigate , left @entity48 in 1804 and crossed the @entity49 to within a day 's sail from @entity1 when @entity52 ships attacked the @entity1 fleet			1
in the ensuing @entity54 , south of @entity55 , the @entity45 exploded after being hit in its power magazine , according to the @entity1 government 's filing to the @entity7 court			1
the federal court in @entity42 in 2009 ruled in favor of @entity1 's claim to the treasure , but @entity18 took the case to the federal appeals court in @entity16 , which ruled last september to uphold the lower court 's ruling			1
at the end of that 53 - page ruling , the three - judge appeals panel wrote , " for the foregoing reasons , the district court did not err when it ordered @entity18 to release the recovered " items to the custody of @entity1 , according to a copy of the order viewed by @entity2			1
since then , @entity18 has filed various motions at the appeals court to overturn or delay the ruling , said @entity80 , a @entity81 , lawyer who is representing @entity1 in the case			2
but on tuesday , the appeals court denied an @entity18 motion , the court 's chief deputy clerk , @entity83 , told @entity2 by phone from @entity16			0
@entity80 , who spoke to @entity2 by phone from @entity81 , said it appears that @entity18 's only possible appeal now would be to the @entity15 @entity27			0
that court agrees to hear only a tiny portion of the cases presented to it			0
the appeals court is expected to send the case in the coming days back to the federal court in @entity42 , which would establish and supervise the procedures for sending the coins to @entity1 , @entity80 said			1
@entity1 believes that the main part of the nearly 600,000 coins are currently in @entity7 , @entity80 said			1
@entity1 's culture minister , @entity102 , told @entity2 in @entity0 on wednesday that the case was never really about the money			0
" we 're not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition , but this is something that enriches our material , artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such , " @entity102 said in an interview			0
he said the coins would be exhibited in @entity1 museums			0
@entity48 has also followed this case			0
the silver and gold came from @entity119 when @entity48 was a @entity1 colony			2
" formally , they have n't claimed anything , but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the @entity119 museums , " @entity102 said			0
the treasure includes a vast trove of coins , included fabled " pieces of eight , " some minted in 1803 in @entity128 , @entity48 , @entity1 officials said at a 2008 news conference			2
the treasure already has crossed the @entity49 twice -- by ship in 1804 and then by plane in the other direction just a few years ago			0
@entity1 officials hope it might finally arrive now for the first time on the @entity1 mainland .			0

the treasure is 600,000 silver and gold coins
the coins went down with a @entity1 warship sunk in battle with @entity52 ships in 1804
a @entity7 - based deep - sea salvage company recovered the coins in 2007
@entity1 filed suit in @entity15 federal court to claim the treasure
