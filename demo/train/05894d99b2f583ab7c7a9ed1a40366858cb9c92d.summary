@entity0 -- with book deals , tv appearances and thousands of readers , moms who detail every moment of their domestic lives online produce some of the @entity9 's most well - read blogs			2
' @entity12 bloggers ' want to stem what they fear is a backlash against their profession			1
many of these " mommy bloggers " even draw the attention of companies that send them free product samples -- everything from toys to baby strollers to video game consoles -- in the hopes of getting positive coverage			1
but to some , these freebies are n't necessarily a good thing			0
readers have complained they can no longer trust their favorite blogger 's advice			0
veteran women bloggers grumble that newcomers sully the genre 's reputation by demanding free products and trips			1
@entity38 published an article last month headlined , " @entity40 or sellout ? " " there has been a turn of goodwill [ against mommy bloggers ] , " said @entity41 , the publisher and editor - in - chief of @entity43			1
" a year ago , bloggers were rising stars			1
six months later , really big marketers like @entity51 got into the game and started backing bloggers			2
" that created a new paradigm : an a-list blogger was not the one who wrote the best and had the most influence , but had the most marketing attention and free products , " she added			0
" it created a new generation of bloggers who blogged to get free stuff			2
" so @entity41 and other women bloggers are taking steps to become more transparent and stem what they fear is a backlash against their profession			1
at last month 's fifth annual @entity73 -- a gathering of more than 1,500 women bloggers in @entity76 -- @entity41 and three other bloggers launched @entity78 , a web site devoted to improving blogger ethics			1
" after a spring and early summer of polarizing debates about blogger compensation , sponsored posts and product reviews , an alarming increase in ethical lapses and idea theft , and a growing backlash against poor blogger relations practices , we believed it was time to refocus on integrity , " the site says			2
as of monday , people from more than 880 blogs had signed the site 's pledge , in which bloggers promise to disclose material relationships , policies and business practices , and let readers know the difference between editorial content and advertising			1
@entity107 , who writes the influential blog @entity108 , was among the first to sign the integrity pledge			0
in an e-mail to @entity1 she wrote , " i signed the pledge to help remind readers , other journalists and government regulators that many , if not most , online writers are committed to honest and ethical writing and that we share the same values as those in the more traditional media			0
" @entity122 , founder of blogging community @entity124 , organized another campaign to free bloggers who feel inundated by @entity128 requests and overwhelmed with product reviews			2
@entity134 's " @entity133 " asks mommy bloggers to go one week -- beginning monday -- without writing about products or services			1
@entity122 , who claims to get up to 75 pitches a day from @entity128 firms , instead wants mommy bloggers to " get back to the basics " and post about their marriages , homes and kids			1
" we are not saying down with @entity128 , we are saying let 's change how we interact with @entity128 and understand the relationship better , " she told @entity1			0
" it is important to get back to brand loyalty , not brand saturation			0
" it should not be about free stuff , " she said , setting up her own joke			0
" unless it is a @entity152			0
" " it seems like this is a case where a few bad eggs are spoiling the omelet , or however that old saying goes , " wrote @entity153 in a recent post on @entity155 , the tech news site			0
" the problem is n't @entity128 , but bloggers who are working with it in a less - than - sincere way			2
" even the federal government is turning its attention to how the mommy blogosphere conducts itself			1
the @entity170 is expected to vote this summer on new ethical guidelines for bloggers			1
while the revised guidelines will apply to all bloggers , @entity170 public affairs specialist @entity173 told @entity1 , " some of the bigger challenges include the mommy blogger issue and the extent to which the blogger must disclose a relationship with an advertiser			1
" @entity185 - based online marketer @entity183 believes many bloggers are n't intentionally deceptive -- just confused about what they should disclose			2
" there is a lack of knowledge [ about ethical rules ] , " said @entity183 , who runs @entity188			0
" the @entity170 did not deliberately set out to confuse everybody but blogging is new for a lot of these women and having that kind of both responsibility and power is new to a lot of bloggers			1
" @entity202 is the founder and ceo of @entity204 , a public - relations firm specializing in marketing to women			2
she believes mommy bloggers often feel overwhelmed by pr pitches and do n't know how to say no. " some bloggers just say ' yes ' because they like being asked and like the stuff , " she said			1
" but what they do n't realize is that they are not going to lose opportunities or not be asked again if they are too busy or overloaded			0
" this week 's @entity128 blackout and the @entity216 campaign may not change the image of mommy bloggers overnight , but they are starting a dialogue			1
" most people want to blog well , " @entity41 said			0
" we can not be the wild , wild @entity222			0
we are instituting a conversation that we all want to be in together			0
that is the best of what blogging is : a conversation			0
