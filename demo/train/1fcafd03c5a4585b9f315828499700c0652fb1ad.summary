-- retired coast guard adm. @entity1 , who is overseeing the federal response to the @entity4 oil spill , said sunday that he is " satisfied " with the amount of dispersants that have been used to clean up the disaster , saying crews have used them only when needed			1
@entity1 's comments were in response to new documents released by a congressional subcommittee that indicate @entity15 officials allowed @entity4 to use excessive amounts of chemical dispersants in the @entity18			1
@entity4 used the chemicals to break up oil after the april 20 deepwater horizon rig explosion sent millions of gallons of crude gushing into the @entity18			1
@entity1 noted that the decision to use the dispersants does not rest with @entity4 ; rather , " it 's a decision by the federal on - scene coordinator , " he said in describing a " very disciplined process			1
" despite a federal directive restricting the use of dispersants , the @entity15 routinely granted exemptions , said rep. @entity33 , chairman of the @entity34			0
in may , the @entity35 , along with the @entity15 , ordered the oil giant to stop surface application of the chemicals during the oil spill except in rare occasions , according to a @entity34 subcommittee on energy and environment			1
in rare cases , exemptions had to be requested , documents show			0
" @entity4 carpet bombed the ocean with these chemicals , and the @entity15 allowed them to do it , " @entity33 said in a statement saturday			1
" after we discovered how toxic these chemicals really are , they had no business being spread across the @entity18 in this manner			0
" @entity1 dismissed @entity33 's allegations during a conference call with reporters sunday			2
" i 'm satisfied that we only use them [ dispersants ] when they 're needed , " he said			0
@entity1 said field commanders on a case - by - case basis have decided to use dispersants when oil has been spotted by surveillance aircraft and no other method of cleaning it up is available in the area			1
" we 're going to accept some impact on the water column " rather than having the oil reach the beach , he said			0
the @entity15 approved more than 74 exemptions in 48 days , @entity33 said			0
in one instance , @entity15 officials allowed the oil giant to use a larger volume of dispersants than it had applied for , he said			2
dispersants are " a toxic stew of chemicals , oil and gas , with impacts that are not well understood , " @entity33 , a @entity77 from @entity78 , said in the letter to @entity1			1
@entity4 issued a statement sunday saying it has worked closely with the @entity35 and the @entity15 over the use of dispersants " since the very beginning " of the disaster			1
" furthermore , we 've complied with @entity35 requests regarding dispersants which are an @entity35 - approved and recognized tool in fighting oil spills , " the statement said			1
@entity96 , @entity4 's chief operating officer , said sunday that the oil company is funding research into the long - term effects of the spill , including the use of dispersants			1
" right now we have n't seen anything that shows us to be concerned , but we 're going to keep looking , " he said			0
@entity33 said the findings are based on an analysis by the @entity105			0
" the use of dispersant is always a difficult decision , with environmental trade - offs that must be taken seriously into consideration , " @entity35 spokesman @entity106 said sunday			2
" as a result , its use in response to the @entity4 spill was subject to numerous strict conditions once it quickly became apparent that @entity4 wanted to use it in unprecedented quantities and in novel ways			2
" @entity4 's use of disperants peaked at 70,000 gallons on may 24 , the @entity35 said			1
it was after that the @entity35 ordered the halt on its use , except for rare occasions			2
from the time that directive was issued , dispersant use dropped 72 percent , @entity106 said			0
initially , the @entity35 was not involved in the day - to - day decisions about which exceptions were granted , but that changed in late june			2
" while @entity35 may not have concurred with every individual waiver granted by the federal on - scene coordinator , the agency believes dispersant use has been an essential tool in mitigating this spill 's impact , preventing millions of gallons of oil from doing even more damage to sensitive marshes , wetlands and beaches and the economy of the @entity146 , " @entity106 said			1
@entity1 said sunday that he and @entity35 administrator @entity147 talk daily about dispersant use , saying " we have n't ignored @entity35 's guidelines			1
" @entity33 said the subcommittee also found contradictions on how much chemical dispersant was being used			0
on other occasions , @entity4 used more than the amount approved by the @entity15 , @entity33 said in his letter			2
the report brings into question the total amount of dispersants used in the @entity18			0
@entity4 says it has used 1.8 million gallons to break up oil flowing from the @entity162 's ruptured well			1
" the validity of those numbers are now in question , " @entity33 said			0
meanwhile sunday , @entity1 announced that the first of two efforts to seal the ruptured well once and for all could begin as early as monday night			2
the " static kill " -- when mud and cement are poured into the well from above -- had been previously delayed while debris that collected during @entity170 can be cleared out			0
@entity96 said that the more likely start for the static kill will be tuesday			0
" i do have a lot of confidence we 'll be successful , " @entity96 said			0
that will be followed by a final " bottom kill " after a relief well intercepts the crippled well -- a step that @entity1 estimated sunday to begin a minimum of five to seven days after the static kill is complete .			0
