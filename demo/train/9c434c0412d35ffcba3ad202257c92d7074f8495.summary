president @entity0 called her " @entity1			2
" such was the power of @entity4 during the @entity5 , a dark time when millions were out of work and struggling to survive			1
into their midst came a little girl in curls , whose films -- such as " @entity13 , " " @entity14 , " " @entity15 " and " captain january " -- allowed them to forget , if just for a little while			2
" @entity4 could make people believe , if only for 90 minutes , that there were no problems in the world , " said a fellow child star , @entity18			1
@entity4 , perhaps the biggest child star in history , died monday			1
there had been child stars before @entity4 -- @entity27 and @entity28 , to name two -- and there is certainly no shortage of them now , with reality tv and child - targeted cable networks minting a perky new imp every six months			1
but with her sparkling personality , song - and - dance talent and sheer box - office power , there has likely been no equal in history			2
photos : child star transformations " ( she ) represented , for many , the epitome of childhood goodness and sentiment , a beacon of hope for the future of @entity53 and the physical embodiment of the perfect child , " wrote a @entity45 sociologist , @entity44 , in " @entity46			1
" share your memories @entity4 everywhere at the peak of her fame in the mid- 1930s there were @entity4 dolls , @entity4 dresses , @entity4 china , @entity4 notebooks , @entity4 soap and @entity4 sheet music			1
there was a nonalcoholic cocktail -- ginger ale with a touch of grenadine , topped with a maraschino cherry -- named for her			2
she was awarded an honorary @entity75 in 1934			2
she was the no. 1 box office star in the nation from 1935 to 1938			2
she almost single - handedly led @entity78 , her studio , back to profitability			2
she was so well - known , so iconic , that even the number of curls in her hair was publicized			0
( it 's 56 , incidentally			0
) " i stopped believing in @entity84 when i was 6 , " she once wrote			0
" @entity85 took me to see him in a department store and he asked for my autograph			0
" through it all , she was barely touched by scandal			0
there were no stories of abusive parents or predatory agents -- though her mother , who did help push her daughter into show business , shaved a year off young @entity4 's age to make her more marketable			1
indeed , the mere suggestion that she was something less than innocent was enough to prompt a furious outcry			0
when @entity45 author @entity104 , then an editor and film critic , wrote in a 1937 review that the 8 - year - old @entity4 was an " adult impersonating a child " and that her co-stars reacted to her " well - shaped and desirable little body , " @entity78 sued			1
the legal challenge ended up putting @entity104 's magazine out of business			0
adulthood , however , did finally put an end to @entity4 's film career			1
in 1940 , @entity78 decided not to renew her contract , which was ok with @entity4 and her family			1
she went off to a @entity121 school and , gradually , adjusted to noncelebrity life			2
she was just about to turn 13			0
@entity4 , the ambassador class and diplomacy she did a bit of acting while in school and after graduating -- one film , 1947 's " @entity130 " with @entity131 , made it into the book " @entity134 " -- but after marrying her second husband , @entity135 , she decided to retire in 1950			1
at 22 , her movie career was over			1
but her life was just beginning			2
@entity4 , child star , became @entity4 , diplomat , who raised three children , served as a @entity140 representative and @entity53 ambassador , and generally kept a low and genteel profile			1
only rarely did she venture back into acting , most notably for a late - ' 50s television series			0
to younger generations , she soon became just a well - known name , her films seen only on late - night tv , her depression - era celebrity all but vanished			0
children of the ' 70s may know her best for an episode of " @entity153 " in which @entity154 becomes obsessed with her			0
children of the 21st century may not know her at all			0
and these days , when being a child star almost invariably comes with a 24 - hour media circus -- followed by calculated moves to showcase adult - like sex appeal -- one wonders if the fame of a @entity4 could last longer than the duration of a @entity163 video			1
( even in her time it was no easy feat , as biographies of any number of child stars indicate			0
) no doubt she 'd be analyzed , objectified and vivisected all over the @entity168 , paparazzi lurking outside her door , waiting for a swear word or a blown - up skirt			0
still , child stars of any era could do worse than model themselves on @entity4			1
when she was a movie star , there was nobody bigger			1
when she was n't a movie star , there were few classier			1
her philosophy was summed up in something she once said in an interview			0
" some people are stuck on this image of the little girl			0
she is not me , " she said			0
" we should n't live in the past			0
