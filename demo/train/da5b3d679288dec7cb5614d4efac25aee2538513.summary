-- there are dueling narratives in the death of @entity4 : one says he was holding his hands up in surrender as officer @entity8 shot him , and the other says @entity4 was the aggressor , and @entity8 shot as @entity4 was rushing toward him			1
investigators will certainly use high - tech tools to try to get to the truth , but they 'll also use a tool as old as the ancient @entity15 : the autopsy			2
three autopsies have been done on @entity4 's body : one by @entity19 ; one privately commissioned by the family and one performed monday by medical examiners from the @entity23 military			1
detailed findings in the private autopsy -- but not from the other two -- have been released			0
based on the circumstances of the case , here are three areas the pathologists likely gave close scrutiny			2
signs of struggle a friend of @entity8 's called into a @entity36 radio show to say that @entity4 " bum rushed " @entity8 and punched him in the face			1
@entity0 confirmed that account matches the one @entity8 told authorities			0
but lawyers for the @entity4 family say the autopsy they commissioned showed no signs of struggle			1
to look for signs of struggle , pathologists pay special attention to the hands , forearms , feet and shins , looking for signs of abrasions , cuts and bruises			1
a bruise on the knuckles might indicate the deceased threw a punch , but a bruise would only show up if the punch was pretty hard , according to dr. @entity61 , a forensic pathologist in @entity62 , @entity63			0
and it would be hard to tell whether the bruise was from a fight with @entity8 or from something else			0
" you really ca n't date a bruise exactly , " @entity61 said			0
" it may have happened two hours ago or five days ago			0
" pathologists also look for another person 's dna under the fingernails to help determine whether the deceased person would have scratched the other person during a struggle			1
the bullet wound at the top of @entity4 's head the family - commissioned autopsy showed @entity4 was shot at the top of his head			1
" that bullet went in there and came out near the eye area , " family lawyer @entity83 said at a press conference			0
" it supports what the witnesses said about him trying to surrender to the officer			0
his head was in a downward position			0
" @entity61 said it 's possible @entity4 was surrendering , but he might have been bent over for other reasons , too : he might have been crouching to dodge bullets or he might have been slumped over because he was weak from his wounds , or he might have been making an attempt to rush at @entity8 with his head down			1
@entity4 was shot at least six times , all to the front of his body , according to the preliminary results of this autopsy			1
four bullets went into his right arm , and he was shot twice in the head			0
gunshot residue @entity8 's friend who called into the radio show said that during the fight inside the officer 's car , both men grabbed for the officer 's gun and it went off			2
dr. @entity118 , the forensic pathologist hired by the @entity4 family , said there was no gunshot residue on @entity4 's skin surface , so at the time the gun went off it was at least a foot or two away			1
but he added that his team had n't had the opportunity to examine @entity4 's clothing , which might have filtered out any gunshot residue			1
' an autopsy is a snapshot ' one crucial question an autopsy alone ca n't answer is whether someone was standing still when he was shot or was moving toward the shooter -- and if he was moving at what speed			0
" an autopsy is a snapshot , " said dr. @entity136 , a forensic pathologist in @entity137 , @entity138			0
" and like a snapshot of a ball in midair , you ca n't tell if it 's going up or coming down , or how fast it 's going up or down			2
" to answer that question , more details from the investigation are needed			0
" it 's uncommon for an autopsy to give you all your answers , " @entity136 added -- even though crime shows on tv often make it look like autopsies answer all questions with illuminating " aha " moments			1
" my mother - in law - loves those shows , so i 've been forced to watch them , but that 's just hokum , " he said			2
