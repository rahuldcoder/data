the first headlines immediately after the attack at the office of @entity4 in @entity5 provide a snapshot of the massacre : two masked men killed 12 people			2
that picture looks much more complex one week later			2
two more attacks -- against a police officer and another that included hostages at a kosher supermarket -- brought the final death toll to 17 , plus three suspects killed			1
the threads that investigators have followed -- from the newsroom of the satirical magazine and the @entity5 supermarket -- have led to other countries , including @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
the untangling of who was behind the attacks has also revealed other suspects , and there have been claims of links to the biggest terrorist groups , @entity35 and @entity36 , which now calls itself the @entity37			2
here is a look at the key people , places and questions that have surfaced as investigators probe more deeply : @entity45 prime minister @entity44 has virtually ruled out a " lone wolf " scenario			1
besides @entity52 and @entity53 , the brothers identified as the shooters at @entity4 who were later killed by police , another man , @entity48 , has been linked to the attacks			1
police killed him last week after he took hostages at the @entity5 kosher grocery store			2
there is one named suspect at large : @entity60 , @entity48 's widow			1
but there are other suspects			2
@entity45 citizen @entity63 was arrested in @entity27 at the border with @entity25 on an unrelated charge , but he faces terrorism charges in connection with the @entity68			1
and @entity45 security services have identified a suspected accomplice in the kosher grocery attack , according to the @entity45 newspaper @entity72			1
police sources cited by the newspaper said one line of investigation is that the accomplice , a man from a @entity5 suburb , may have driven @entity48 to the market , where @entity48 later shot dead four people			1
" we are doing everything we can to dismantle what appears to be a network			2
... no doubt there was complicity and networks and maybe finance also , " @entity44 told @entity0 's @entity84			2
given the magnitude of the operations and the apparent sophistication of the gunmen , many wonder who , if anyone , trained or possibly gave orders to the attackers			2
@entity97 , or @entity97 , has claimed credit for the magazine attack			2
" when the heroes were assigned , they accepted			2
they promised and fulfilled , " @entity97 commander @entity102 said in a video message , referring to the @entity53 brothers and the slayings at @entity4			2
the late @entity109 - born @entity108 cleric @entity107 is the one who masterminded that operation before his 2011 death , @entity97 said			0
past statements by the three main suspects claim allegiance to @entity35 or @entity36 , an unsatisfying answer because the two terror groups are considered rivals			2
both jihadist groups have an @entity120 worldview , however , and it is possible that even if the suspects plotted together , they may have been inspired by different groups			0
@entity53 and @entity124 are both said to have traveled to @entity24			0
@entity53 , before he was killed by police , told @entity0 affiliate @entity126 that he 'd trained in @entity24 with @entity97			2
@entity53 used his brother 's passport to travel to @entity24 in 2011 , two @entity128 intelligence sources with knowledge of the matter told @entity0 , adding that it was likely he had trained with @entity97 there			0
a senior @entity24 national security official told @entity0 that @entity52 had also entered @entity24 multiple times			0
@entity48 also called @entity126 before he was killed			1
he purportedly said by phone that he belonged to @entity36			0
that information has n't been corroborated by authorities , and it 's not known whether he knew any leaders or members of that terrorist group			0
in the aftermath of the @entity5 attacks , his widow , @entity60 , is believed to have fled to @entity26 , where @entity36 operates			1
@entity146 tried to justify market raid to hostages , recording apparently shows terrorism experts say @entity36 and @entity35 have an adversarial relationship , so how are the self - proclaimed @entity35 followers @entity52 and @entity53 linked to the self - proclaimed @entity36 member @entity48 ? @entity124 's wife told investigators that her husband and @entity48 knew each other well			1
@entity45 court documents show that @entity48 and @entity53 were also close associates and plotted to stage a prison break to free a fellow terrorist in 2010			1
@entity53 and @entity48 had a mentor in common , a radical named @entity161			1
once known as @entity35 's premiere @entity163 recruiter , @entity161 was convicted of conspiring to attack the @entity164 in @entity5			0
the attack was years in the making , @entity97 claims , and was conceived as revenge for @entity4 's depictions of the @entity169			0
@entity170 blamed not only the satirical magazine , but also @entity45 and the @entity109 in his statement			0
" it is @entity45 that has shared all of @entity109 's crimes , " @entity102 added			0
" it is @entity45 that has committed crimes in @entity179 and the @entity180			0
it is @entity45 that supports the annihilation of @entity183 in @entity184 in the name of race cleansing			0
" ( " @entity180 " refers to @entity187			1
) @entity109 officials told @entity0 it 's believed that when @entity53 traveled to @entity24 in 2011 , he returned carrying money from @entity97 earmarked to carry out the attack			0
investigators said the terrorist group could have given as much as $ 20,000 , but the exact amount has not been verified			0
it is notable that @entity97 did not claim responsibility for the siege at the @entity5 kosher grocery store where four hostages were killed , along with gunman @entity48			1
@entity97 praised the attack at the kosher grocery store , calling it a " blessing from @entity202 " that happened at the same time as the attack on @entity4 's office			0
@entity60 's name came to light in the @entity5 attacks shortly after the @entity53 brothers were identified			1
she was named a suspect together with her husband , @entity48			1
there were initial reports that she had fled after the kosher market attack , but this was not confirmed , and new evidence suggests that she was not in @entity45 at all during the attacks			0
but she could be a key to unraveling the details behind the attacks			1
authorities are looking into whether @entity60 helped prepare the attacks before leaving @entity45			1
@entity60 arrived in @entity25 from @entity224 on january 2 , five days before the first attack in @entity5 , @entity25 's @entity223 news agency reports			1
@entity60 stayed at an @entity228 hotel and then traveled to @entity26 on thursday , @entity226 said			1
the last place authorities spotted @entity60 was somewhere near @entity25 's border with @entity26			1
a surveillance video image shows her at an @entity228 airport with a man beside her			0
on tuesday , @entity45 's @entity235 newspaper identified the man as @entity237 , describing him as someone known to @entity45 intelligence and who could have ties to a separate jihadist cell			2
@entity237 's brother , the newspaper said , was imprisoned last year for helping send fighters to @entity246 and @entity247			0
he is @entity45 citizen @entity248			0
he was arrested near the border with @entity25 for allegedly kidnapping his son , @entity27 @entity251 spokeswoman @entity250 said			1
the ministry said that @entity63 will remain in custody until at least january 20 , when a " court will consider ( a ) second warrant related to terrorism charges			0
" a @entity27 prosecutor said the terrorism charge is regarding @entity63 's contacts with the @entity53 brothers , @entity259 reported			1
" the charges are for participation in an organized crime group whose aim was ... terrorist acts , " the prosecutor said			0
@entity27 officials referred further questions to @entity45 authorities			1
it is unclear what @entity63 's contact with the @entity53 brothers entailed			0
as @entity45 officials dig deeper into the suspects behind the attacks , they must deal with a new threat from an @entity35 affiliate			0
the affiliate in @entity187 , the @entity180 , published a threat against @entity45 on jihadist websites			1
" @entity45 pays the cost of its violence on @entity108 countries and the violation of their sanctity , " the group said in its statement			0
" as long as its soldiers occupy countries such as @entity179 and @entity184 and bombard our people in @entity26 and @entity297 , and as long as its lame media continues to undermine our @entity169 ( @entity169 ) , @entity45 will expose itself to the worst and more			0
