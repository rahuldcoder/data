@entity1 , @entity0 -- like many of us , and especially those of us staying off the streets of @entity8 , i 've been not knowing things all day			1
that 's because i 've been watching the mainstream media as well as my favorite social media			2
it turns out that not knowing something reveals its own kind of truth			1
yesterday , when we did n't have a suspect no. 1 or no. 2 , we each filled in the blanks			2
we assumed the perpetrators were terrorists , which implies a political motive			2
i 'm going to guess that a vast majority of us assumed that the perpetrators would be male and not very old , because that 's what our experience has shown us			2
we may also have filled in blanks about complexion , religion , and whether we expected them to have accents			2
these are more likely to show us something about how we think the world works			1
for example , as friday has worn on , you probably were not surprised to hear the suspects ' friends and neighbors say that they were " quiet " and " nice , " because that 's what neighbors of mass murderers seem to always say			1
but i was quite surprised when more and more people came forward effusively praising @entity45 as someone who reveled in diversity , who was always helpful , who worked with the cognitively disabled , who was highly social			1
why was i surprised ? because it does n't fit my pre-built narratives			1
it 's made me realize that i only have three @entity52 into which i slot the facts about any particular incident			0
first is the anti-american : someone who so hates this country that he ( and sometimes she ) attacks it			0
@entity60 is the @entity61 : the resentful loner out to take revenge on those who are more popular , or who relishes his or her few minutes of popularity 's stand - in , celebrity			0
@entity70 is the @entity71 : someone completely detached from reality			0
of course , these are not mutually exclusive			0
but why these three ? after all , there are other narratives available by which i could understand these horrific events			0
for example , some people have narratives that involve people being evil , or about weak mortals being tempted by satanic forces , or about brave soldiers fighting the forces of the " @entity87			0
" the narratives that shape our expectations in the absence of actual information can tell us a lot about our most basic understanding of the world			1
for example , my three narratives each assume humans are pretty much autonomous , and therefore we have to look inside them to see the reasons they acted -- a set of political beliefs for the anti-american , impossible social needs for the @entity61 , and totally crazy beliefs for the @entity71			0
further , all three of my narratives assume that empathy and social connection are the natural state for humans , so you have to come up with reasons to explain antisocial behavior ; there are other narratives that say that humans are fundamentally selfish , so you have to explain altruistic behavior			0
i am not recommending my narratives			0
i 'm just saying that seeing how you assimilate scraps of information when you do n't actually know anything can illuminate the basic riverbeds your understanding runs through			1
as the evidence drips in , watch which pieces make sense to you , and which ones do n't			0
his family is from @entity128 ? if you nod as if you knew it all along , that tells you what narrative you prefer			0
if you expected to hear that his @entity133 page was bitter and depressed , then you again know how you 'd like to understand the world			1
this inability to maintain blanks in our understanding is n't a failure of understanding so much as it 's a consequence of what it means to be conscious creatures			1
to understand an event is to see it as part of a sequence of related events -- that is , to see it as part of a story			0
that 's what understanding does			2
it 's perhaps paradoxical that the condition of understanding is also inimical to seeing things in new ways , and often to see them as they actually are			1
we can at times come to new narratives and new understandings , but it 's not easy , it 's rare , and it does n't free us from this basic limitation of thought -- a limitation made clear when we 're sitting in front of our screens not knowing			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			1

@entity178 has been laying low in @entity8 not knowing things all day
he says assumptions *abounded* before suspects were named
if new details have surprised us , we learn something about how we think the world works , he says
@entity178 : we funnel understanding through our assumptions
