-- 2012 has been a tumultuous year in @entity2 politics			1
with the presidential election capping off the year , @entity2 have witnessed a series of bitter domestic battles and turbulent events overseas			1
as the year closes out , it is worth thinking about some of the most important lessons that politicians and voters can learn from this year as they prepare for 2013			1
here are six : the @entity13 brand name is in trouble : the @entity13 took a drubbing in 2012			1
to be sure , @entity16 ran a problematic campaign			2
his inability to connect with voters and a number of embarrassing gaffes hurt the chances for @entity13 to succeed			1
just as important to the outcome was the party that @entity16 represented			0
voters are not happy with the @entity13			1
public approval for the party has been extremely low			0
congressional republicans have helped to bring down the party name with their inability to compromise			0
recent polls show that if the nation goes off the fiscal cliff , the @entity13 would be blamed			1
according to a survey by @entity36 and the @entity37 , 65 percent of people asked for a short word or phrase to describe the @entity13 came up with something negative			1
the @entity13 was also the lowest - rated political institution			1
the exit polls in november showed that the @entity13 is out of step with the electorate on a number of big issues , including immigration and gay marriage			1
if @entity13 do n't undertake some serious reforms and offer fresh voices , all the new messaging in the world wo n't help them as the competition starts for 2016			1
opinion : madness in the air in @entity57 @entity2 has grown more liberal on cultural and social issues : the election results confirmed what polls have been showing for some time			1
if the 1960s was a battle over conservative " traditional family values " and liberal ideals of social relations , liberals eventually won			0
throughout the year , polls showed , for example , that the public was becoming more tolerant of gay marriage and civil unions			1
@entity2 support the view that gay sex should be legal by a margin of 2 - 1 , compared to 1977 when the public was split			1
in the election , same - sex marriage was approved in three states , voters in @entity77 sent to office the first openly gay senator , and two states approved of referendums to legalize the recreational use of marijuana			0
@entity2 are accepting of social diversity , and expect that the pluralism of the electorate will be reflected by the composition of elected officials in @entity57			1
while there are some conservative voices who lament these changes and warn of a nation that is veering toward @entity98 , a majority are more than comfortable that some of the taboos and social restrictions of earlier eras are fading and that we live in a nation which is more tolerant than ever before			0
these social and cultural changes will certainly raise more questions about restrictive practices and policies that remain in place while creating pressure for new kinds of leaders who are responsive to these changes			0
the @entity114 remains a tinderbox : in the years that followed @entity119 's election , there was some hope that the @entity114 could become a calmer region			0
when revolutions brought down some of the most notorious dictators in the region , many @entity2 cheered as the fervor for democracy seemed to be riding high			1
but events in 2012 threw some cold water on those hopes			2
the @entity129 won control of the @entity132 government			2
in @entity133 , the government brutally cracked down on opponents , reaching the point in december where @entity119 's administration has started to talk about the possibility of the @entity139 regime using chemical weapons , though the severity of the threat is unclear			0
the battles between @entity144 and @entity145 raged with rockets being fired into @entity148 and @entity145 bombing targets in @entity149			2
although national attention is focused on domestic policy , it is clear that the @entity114 has the capacity to command national attention at any moment and remains as explosive as ever			2
our infrastructure needs repair : @entity158 devastated the @entity159 in november , leaving millions of @entity2 on the @entity160 without power and with damaged property			1
soon after the hurricane hit , @entity164 gov. @entity163 made an important point			0
the infrastructure of our cities is outdated and needs to be revamped so that it can withstand current weather patterns			0
speaking of the need for levees in @entity164 , @entity163 said : " it is something we 're going to have to start thinking about ... the construction of this city did not anticipate these kinds of situations			0
" regardless of whether @entity179 takes action on the issue of climate change , in the short term cities and suburbs must do more work to curtail the kind of damage wreaked by these storms and to mitigate the costs of recovery -- building underground power lines , increasing resources for emergency responders , building state - of - the - art water systems , and constructing effective barriers to block water from flooding			0
the new immigrants are a powerful political and social force : as was the case in the turn of the twentieth century when @entity205 and @entity207 @entity206 came into this county , massive waves of immigration are remaking the social fabric of the nation			2
latino - americans , @entity212 and other new portions of the electorate who have been coming into the country since the reform of immigration laws in 1965 are coming to represent a bigger and bigger portion of the electorate			0
not only are their numbers growing as a voting bloc , but they are more organized and active than ever before , both on election day as well as in policy making			0
soon after the election , the @entity226 reported that 600 members of @entity229 we dream , a network of younger immigrants who do n't have their papers , met for three days to plan how to lobby for a bill that would enable 11 million illegal immigrants to become legal			2
one of the leaders , @entity237 , explained : " we have an unprecedented opportunity to engage our parents , our cousins , our abuelitos in this fight			0
" they have both parties scrambling as @entity245 are working to fulfill the promises that brought these voters to their side in november , while some @entity13 are desperate to dampen the influence of hardline anti-immigration activists in their party			1
we need to do something about guns			0
the year ended with a horrific shooting at an elementary school in @entity256			1
when a 20 - year - old went on a rampage apparently using guns that had been legally purchased by his mother , the world watched with horror			2
several prominent conservative advocates of gun rights , including former congressman and television host @entity267 as well as sen. @entity268 , made statements indicating that the time has come to impose stricter controls and regulations on the purchase of weapons			2
" i do n't know anybody in the sporting or hunting arena that goes out with an assault file , " @entity268 said			0
over the next few weeks , there will certainly be a big debate about what caused this shooting			0
people from different perspectives will highlight different issues but making it more difficult for people to get their hands on certain kinds of weapons , while not a cure - all , can only diminish the chances of this happening again			0
there are many more lessons but these six stand out			0
after the trauma of the past week , let 's hope the new year starts off with better days			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity300 .			1
