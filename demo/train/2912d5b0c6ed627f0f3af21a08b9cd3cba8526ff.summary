@entity0 -- president @entity2 signed legislation thursday evening extending several key provisions of the @entity5 shortly before they were set to expire at midnight			1
the provisions -- passed after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack -- deal with roving wiretaps , the tracking of alleged " lone wolf " terrorists , and the ability of law enforcement officials to obtain records they deem relevant to an investigation after securing an order from a federal court			0
the bill passed both the @entity19 and the @entity20 earlier in the day			1
@entity2 , currently on a trip to @entity22 , directed the use of an autopen -- a signature reproduction device -- to sign the measure , according to @entity28 spokesman @entity27			1
the @entity19 was forced to briefly delay the start of its @entity31 recess to vote on the measure			1
a protracted dispute over the legislation in the @entity20 , fueled by conservative newcomer sen. @entity35 , @entity36 , muddied voting schedules			1
@entity35 reached a deal with @entity20 leaders to allow votes on whether to table two of his amendments			1
both amendments failed , and the subsequent @entity20 vote on the measure to extend the @entity5 provisions for four years passed easily on a 72 - 23 vote			1
the 250 - 153 @entity19 vote was tighter , with lawmakers on the right and left opposing an extension for various reasons			1
for example , some members of @entity53 are concerned about the law 's impact on civil liberties , while others support the law but think it should be made permanent			0
one of the three provisions , section 206 of the @entity5 , provides for roving wiretap surveillance of targets who try to thwart @entity66 ( @entity66 ) surveillance			1
without such roving wiretap authority , investigators would be forced to seek a new court order each time they need to change the location , phone or computer that needs to be monitored			0
another provision , section 215 of the @entity5 , allows the @entity75 to apply to the @entity66 court to issue orders granting the government access to any tangible items in foreign intelligence , international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases			2
the third provision , section 6001 of the @entity86 and @entity85 of 2004 , closes a loophole that could allow individual terrorists not affiliated with specific organizations to slip through the cracks of @entity66 surveillance			0
law enforcement officials refer to it as the " lone wolf " provision			0
legislators opposed to the extensions claim that the provisions -- particularly related to wiretapping -- are intrusive and unconstitutional			0
supporters argue that they are a critical component of @entity102 anti-terror operations			0
@entity35 , a favorite of the @entity105 movement , engaged in a bitter showdown wednesday with @entity107 , @entity108 , who sought to limit the number of amendments that @entity35 could offer			2
then on thursday , @entity35 complained that it was @entity20 @entity113 leaders now holding up consideration of his amendments			1
in a rare public rebuke of his own party 's leadership , @entity35 said he was " disappointed " by their actions and urged people to contact @entity113 leadership offices in protest			2
" i 've been working for two long days filibustering the @entity5 in hopes that we can have a constitutional debate over certain provisions of it and we can try to reform it to take away some of the encroachments on our freedoms , " @entity35 said			1
" unfortunately , what we 're finding now is that the @entity132 have agreed to allow me to have amendments , but my own party is refusing to allow me to debate or present my amendments			0
" in particular , @entity35 sought to propose an amendment preventing warrantless access to some gun records			2
@entity113 leaders do n't want a vote on his amendment because they are conflicted by it , @entity35 said			2
they do n't want to vote to weaken the @entity5 by making it more difficult for law enforcement to obtain any information -- including gun records -- related to a terrorism investigation , he said , but they also do n't want to take a vote that could be viewed negatively by gun rights groups			2
one @entity20 @entity113 leader , sen. @entity148 of @entity149 , rejected @entity35 's analysis but refused to explain why or even if @entity113 leaders were blocking @entity35 's amendment			1
after reaching the deal to debate two of his amendments , @entity35 said on the @entity20 floor that his motivation was to protect personal liberties rather than to harm the @entity5 or undermine security in any way			1
" it 's very important that we are always vigilant , that we are eternally vigilant about the powers of government , " @entity35 said in arguing for tighter restrictions on the ability of federal investigators to access some gun ownership records			2
he went on to complain in general about what he characterized as a federal overreaction to the 9/11 attacks that reduced individual liberty in the name of security			0
for example , he said , airline travelers are all considered possible terrorists and screened for security reasons ; he described such a strategy as a " shotgun " approach			0
" are we so afraid that we 're giving up all of our liberty for security ? " @entity35 asked , calling for tighter restrictions on what the government can investigate without a search warrant			0
however , fellow conservative sen. @entity188 , @entity189 , said @entity35 's amendment to end warrantless access to gun records would hinder the government 's ability to prevent terrorist attacks within the @entity102			0
" i do n't understand why we would take this tool away from national security investigators , " @entity188 said , adding that there have been " no reports that the government has ever used these provisions to violate anyone 's @entity201 rights			0
" @entity1 's @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this story .			0
