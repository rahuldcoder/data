-- @entity1 would topple gov. @entity2 in @entity3 , and @entity3 voters do n't think @entity5 wants a " @entity7 " president , according to a new poll released thursday			1
the @entity9 indicates that the former secretary of state would carry @entity3 , 50 % -39 % , over the state 's two - term , incumbent governor if the election were held today			0
while @entity2 won convincingly in his re-election bid as a @entity18 governor last year , the odds are still stacked against him electorally			0
the state has a plurality of @entity22 voters , and it has n't voted for a @entity18 presidential candidate since 1988			0
poll : @entity1 ahead in 5 would - be @entity18 match - ups in fact , the same @entity9 survey shows @entity28 has been ahead of @entity2 in hypothetical match - ups since february 2013			1
still , a majority of @entity3 voters ( 53 % ) says @entity2 would not make a good president , slightly down from april , when 57 % felt the same way			1

the last @entity3 guy who got elected president did not carry the state in his 1916 reelection , " @entity38 , assistant director of the @entity9 , said in a news release			2
" and this poll shows we have n't changed in the last century			2
" @entity2 : @entity5 ' missing an enormous opportunity ' on @entity47 if he does make a @entity51 bid , a decision he 's said he 'll make " well into 2015 , " more than six in 10 @entity3 voters think he should resign his governorship , something his aides have said he wo n't do			1
@entity2 had sky - high approval ratings following the devastation from @entity58 in 2012 , but his numbers have been slipping since the @entity61 scandal unfolded earlier this year and as the state 's economic struggles have garnered more attention			0
he also saw criticism in @entity3 for his frequent travels out of state this year as chairman of the @entity69 , a job that took him around the country campaigning for 2014 @entity18 candidates			0
for the poll , @entity9 surveyed 1,340 registered voters in @entity3 over the phone from dec. 3 - 8			2
