-- when then sen. @entity4 was running for president , many of his critics accused him of being a @entity6 -- as if being a @entity6 in a country that prides itself for its freedom of religion is a bad thing			1
in fact a @entity11 poll taken october 2008 found 16 % of voters who identified as conservative @entity14 thought he was , despite numerous photos of him and his family attending a traditional @entity20 church			0
despite @entity4 saying he was a @entity20			1
in july 2012 , that number increased to 30 % despite more photos of him attending a @entity20 church			0
despite @entity4 repeating he is a @entity20			1
in 2008 , his critics accused him of not being born in the @entity26 -- despite the @entity14 governor of @entity28 that he was and birth announcements from 1961 in the state 's two primary newspapers so in 2011 , to appease these critics , @entity4 released the long form of his birth certificate			1
and in 2013 a poll taken by @entity36 found that 64 % of @entity14 believe @entity4 " is hiding important information about his background and early life , which would include what 's often referred to ' birtherism			1
' " or as i like to call it -- craziness			0
which brings us all to @entity47			0
opinion : more gun mayhem , and yet we wait for action in yet another attempt to appease irrational critics , the @entity51 released a photo of the president shooting a gun to prove he is not an enemy of the @entity58 and that he has in fact shot a gun before ( as if that 's required to not want criminals or the mentally ill to have access to semi-automatic weapons			1
) and surprise , surprise skeptics are not satisfied , saying the picture is fake and his affinity for shooting phony , even though there 's evidence of president @entity4 talking about practicing shooting a rifle with members of the @entity73 way back in 2010			1
" one picture does not erase a lifetime of supporting every gun ban and every gun - control scheme imaginable , " said @entity74 , spokesman for the @entity75			0
well @entity80 should tell @entity81 about all of @entity4 's gun - control support because it seems each time there 's been a mass shooting the outspoken mayor of @entity88 tears into the president			1
" the president has spent the last three years trying to avoid the issue , or if he 's facing it , i do n't know of anybody who has seen him face it , " @entity81 said on @entity90 's " @entity93 " days after the @entity92 shooting			1
@entity81 was right of course			0
as a candidate in 2008 , @entity4 talked about reinstating the federal ban on assault weapons , but he had n't aggressively addressed guns from a policy perspective until december 's @entity106 tragedy			1
in fact , in a blatant display of hypocrisy , while the @entity75 demonized @entity4 for something he did n't do , they endorsed @entity112 , who actually did sign a law banning assault weapons while governor of @entity116			2
but those are all just facts			2
and when you 're dealing with crazy people , it does n't really matter how many facts you present , because -- well -- they 're crazy and they 're just going to believe what they 're going to believe			2
@entity124 sings praises of gun ownership i thought the president learned this lesson after the whole @entity6 / birther slander hurled his way in his first term			0
but , barely a couple of weeks into his second term , here @entity4 is once again releasing photos in an effort to silence irrational critics who pay no attention to the facts			1
some of his critics are justified in their challenges to his policies because the facts do n't support some of his administration 's claims			2
some critics are concerned about the direction of the economy and legitimately think he is doing a sub-par job			0
but there are some who just want to watch his world burn and they do n't give a damn what else or who else burns with him			0
and it does n't matter how many documents the @entity51 releases , @entity4 simply will not win those people over			1
" a lot of people want to see his college transcripts , " @entity160 said in an interview with @entity162 last year			0
" they 're not looking at his marks , his grades			0
... they want to see , what does he say about place of birth			2
now , those transcripts have disappeared , nobody seems to be able to get them			0
" after college transcripts it will be his marriage license			0
this constant push to prove " he 's not one of us " is not going to go away			0
so the next time the @entity75 or @entity160 or whoever else feels the need to question @entity4 's cred , instead of posting pictures of him shooting a gun or going to church or what have you , he should post a graphic showing he 's the first president since @entity194 to capture at least 51 % of the popular vote twice			1
@entity4 still backs new gun ban ; top senator less certain that mandate from the @entity26 people is really all the cred he needs			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2

@entity203 : @entity4 has been challenged on his religion and place of birth
he says in both cases @entity4 took pains to demonstrate the truth about his background
now @entity51 has released a photo of president skeet shooting to back up his statements
@entity219 : trying to appease critics who ignore the facts will never work
