will and @entity1 's 11 - year - old daughter , @entity0 , was recently given a tongue - lashing on social media after posting a picture of herself sporting a tongue piercing on @entity6			1
asapniceee : " she is too young for such a provocative piercing			1
why would her parents let her pierce her tongue ? " tiffaneybabeyy : " at your age , @entity0 , i do n't think a piercing should be on you , especially there			1
" mariajx91 : " maybe you should stop rushing to grow up @entity0			1
you 're 11 , and that does n't look good at any age to be honest			1
" though she later revealed that it was in fact a fake , magnetic tongue ring , people were already whipping their opinions back and forth about whether young people are too vulnerable to make permanent ( or potentially scarring ) decisions about their bodies			1
the issue : what is classified as " too young " ? while the battle over body modification typically occurs between parents and their children , state legislatures have entered the conversation as well			1
a tattoo artist 's take on summertime body art in june , @entity37 , a @entity38 grandfather , lost custody of his 10 - year - old grandson after allowing him to get a tattoo of his initials on his right leg			1
a " family tradition , " according to @entity37			0
under @entity38 law , a person younger than 16 years old can not be tattooed except " for medical or dental reasons , " and anyone age 16 to 18 can be tattooed only with the consent of a parent or guardian			1
that law was changed in january 2012 ; it had previously allowed tattooing under the age of 16 so long as the minor had parental consent			1
most states allow tattoos and body piercings for children under the age of majority , which is 18 years old in most of the @entity62 , with parental consent			1
though , some have tightened restrictions			0
in @entity70 , " no person shall knowingly tattoo , brand or perform body piercing on any minor under the age of fourteen ( 14 ) years			1
" in @entity72 , anyone under the age of 21 is prohibited from being tattooed			1
if a person is 18 , a parent can give consent , but anyone under 18 is prohibited from ink of any type			1
and in @entity80 , it is unlawful for anyone under age 18 to receive a tattoo without written parental consent			1
child development experts contacted by @entity85 agree with this age of majority for permanent body modification in young adults , but also assert age is but a number ; maturity level is a much better parameter to go by			1
psychiatrist @entity93 , an assistant clinical professor in the @entity94 at @entity95 , says it helps to look at a child 's functioning in other areas of their life , such as school and peer relationships			0
" the brain of a young person is still developing and they are less risk averse , more impulsive , and more likely to engage in risky behaviors , " says @entity93			1
inking for @entity109 : dozens of church members take @entity113 tattoo challenge " this is because the last part of the brain to develop is the part that tells them to ' put the brakes on ' before they do something potentially harmful and dangerous			0
" it 's also permanent , adds @entity121 , a professor of sociology at the @entity123 and author of " @entity125			0
" " tattoos , for example , have some style credibility because they reflect a willingness to ' trade in skin			1
' they are thus a @entity133 for young people , " says @entity121			2
" the aesthetic commitment they require probably extends too far into a young person 's future -- how will they know they will be the sort of person to like it when they are 30 , 40 or 50 ? but that risk is exactly what makes them appealing			2
" @entity147 recognizes that aesthetic commitment now , but it was a different story when she got her first tattoo at the age of 15			2
" i had just broken up with my boyfriend , ' the love of my life , ' and it 's a heart with a dagger through it on my right calf			0
it 's huge and it 's a horrible reminder of a painful childhood and bad teenage decisions , " kevilus shares on @entity85 's facebook page			0
@entity163 , however , says those reminders are exactly why he does n't regret his decision to get his first tattoo at age 17			2
" i do n't regret my tattoos			2
each one reminds me of where i was at certain stages off my life , and my mindset			0
it 's like keeping a scrapbook , only on my body and not collecting dust on a shelf somewhere taking up space , " he says via @entity172			2
piercing ears is socially acceptable in @entity62 , especially for girls , in contrast to earlobe stretching or tongue rings , like @entity1 's , that are far less common			2
in some @entity187 and @entity188 cultures , it 's customary to pierce a baby girl 's ears shortly after they 're born			0
" children 's bodies are especially susceptible to this kind of social policing			2
we allow them to modify their bodies to some degree so long as they do not step outside the norm ; we see it as our jobs to bring them up as social ideals , " she says			2
@entity121 says the double standard ultimately adds to the appeal for minors			0
" children are very good at detecting this kind of hypocrisy			0
" tattoos : a journey of @entity214 acceptance dr. @entity215 , of @entity216 in @entity217 , says he sees tattoo removal patients as early as their twenties now			2
the three main motivators are relationships , work and motherhood			0
@entity225 got her first -- and only -- tattoo when she was 15 with her mother 's consent , and already began to regret it a few years later when she entered college			2
she has since undergone laser tattoo removal			0
" nobody under 18 knows what he or she wants forever			0
i cringe when i hear young people talk about inking themselves			0
i do n't ( think ) the concept of ' permanent ' or ' forever ' resonates well with the young , " she says			0
" i do n't see laser tattoo removal as a body - changing procedure ; i see it as restoring a person , " says @entity215			0
unless it is a quality - of - life procedure like gastric bypass , he , like @entity93 and @entity121 , also thinks it 's best for young adults to wait to have any body - changing procedures until they 're of legal age			1
it 's ultimately not what the young people are doing , but why			0
" it is important for young people to develop what is on the inside and then what other people see will not matter as much , " says @entity93			0
" at the end of the day , you have to feel good about who you are and often a cosmetic change will not fix what is underneath			0
" would you let your child get a body piercing or tattoo if they were not yet 18 ? did you get a tattoo at a young age ? share your thoughts in the comments			1
seventeen vows it wo n't alter images in its pages on @entity272 , teens ask the world : am i ugly ?			0
