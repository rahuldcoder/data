-- in times of crisis , when there are great challenges and sorrow , a nation naturally turns to its leader			1
we see it in the aftermath of the @entity12 school killings , as we have often in the past			0
that is as it should be , because the president has more power than anyone to shape the course of events			2
no president embodied that responsibility more fully than @entity23 , the decision - maker , consoler - in - chief , and single - minded political pursuer of a just cause			1
as the movie " @entity23 " tops the nomination lists for this year 's film awards , millions more will rush to see it , probably looking for " @entity23 , " or some such fictional character , from a sketch designed to shape school children into patriotic citizens			1
do not expect to find that @entity23 in @entity37 's sometimes brooding , always passionate , extraordinary film			1
do not expect to see the giant of the granite monument			0
this @entity40 is much more interesting , much more complicated , and much more relevant			1
when history speaks : @entity23 's three lessons for a second term " @entity40 " is brilliant because it shows us that the path of virtue is paved with morally ambiguous choices			1
the @entity23 of @entity50 's remarkable screenplay is not a man whose every decision radiates righteousness			1
the movie focuses on a few weeks during the last throes of the @entity56 as @entity23 sought to pressure @entity57 to approve the 13th amendment to the @entity59 , abolishing slavery forever			1
in one scene , familiar from the original trailer , @entity61 ' @entity23 asks about the war eviscerating the nation , " shall we stop this bleeding ? " you might think the answer is " yes , of course , the sooner the better			1
" the film , however , makes an astonishing argument : that @entity23 deliberately allowed the @entity56 to go on , even as the @entity73 sought to make peace			1
he did it for political reasons , in order to win passage of the amendment			0
that theory is not universally embraced by historians , but @entity50 makes a credible case			0
if true , it means @entity23 knowingly allowed thousands to die because he believed that only with the killings unstaunched would he manage to create enough political pressure through the false argument that the amendment was needed to stop the war			1
" think of all the boys who will die if you do n't make peace , " admonishes @entity88 , the elder @entity90 operator ( whose " @entity92 " home is now the official state guest house ) played by @entity94 , exuding wisdom and aplomb			0
@entity23 does , and we can only imagine what demons haunt him as he tours battlefields carpeted with the bodies of young soldiers			1
the movie shows not - always - @entity23 driven by the morally impeccable goal of ending slavery but repeatedly taking questionable steps in the process			1
in this realistic view of a romantic figure , there is no disputing the inspiring words of the rev. @entity114 , a favorite phrase of president @entity116 's , that " the arc of the moral universe ... bends toward justice			1
" but we learn that it can take a muscular push by determined individuals to produce a visible curvature during our lifetime			0
@entity23 and his allies behave in ways that today would send investigative journalists on frantic pursuits			1
they prod members of @entity57 to vote with the president , but often not on the power of the ideal			2
it is striking just how much @entity136 's values and beliefs have changed			2
a mere 150 years ago they called " radicals " the ones who held the fringe belief that all men , including slaves , really are created equal			0
the radicals , by the way , were primarily @entity90			0
to obtain the votes of @entity147 , @entity23 did n't rely on his verbal gifts			1
glowing with determination , he declares , " i am the president of the @entity136 clothed in immense power			2
you will procure me these votes ! " from historian @entity155 , whose biography is one of the main sources of the screenplay , we know @entity23 built a @entity159 from former opponents			2
from that " @entity167 , " the man who ran against him for the nomination is now secretary of state @entity163 , played by @entity164 , as @entity23 's right - hand man in the project			1
( that may have inspired @entity116 to bring secretary of state @entity169 to his @entity159			2
) he hires a gang of political operatives to obtain the votes			0
" the president is never to be mentioned , " @entity163 warns			2
" led by @entity178 's shifty character , they offer thinly veiled bribes , lucrative patronage jobs , in exchange for the vote			2
@entity40 allows the radical @entity90 @entity183 , played by @entity184 , to engage in his own dishonorable means in pursuit of the most honorable of goals			2
the lessons are countless , because the story is told with a heavy dose of realism			0
@entity37 knows how to make an audience cry			0
but this is no @entity194 fairytale ; this is not " @entity196			0
" this is raw politics			0
we look at the world through the lens of our time			0
we see today 's problems transposed like one of those school art books with the transparent sheet where we can trace an outline over a picture			0
we will see today 's political battles over gun control or the fiscal cliff in the high - pressure machinations			0
we will see the fight for same - sex marriage in the changing attitudes and the recalcitrant ones			0
and we will see the challenge , successfully met by @entity23 , of bringing together people of different political parties and different ideologies to achieve major goals , along with the indispensable requirement of a clear vision and an unbreakable determination in pursuit of an ideal			2
the story carries a sobering message for idealists , who would like to hear the violins play as their hero bravely does everything that is right and noble			0
and cynics will take the message too far , justifying every kind of deviousness and inflexibility			0
@entity238 did , at every step , was not free of ethical stain			1
and yet , his long - term perspective provided a strong moral framework , a context to judge how dark a stain was compared to the one he sought to erase			0
the @entity23 of " @entity40 " is brilliant because it shows a political figure navigating the perilous ambiguities of life , making the decisions that history , 150 years later , has judged heroic and correct			1
now , that deserves a giant granite monument , a flurry of awards and the greatest honor of all : a real - life president who emulates @entity23 's courage in times of crisis			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity264 .			0

@entity267 : " @entity40 " is brilliant because it shows that virtue is complicated
@entity270 : everything @entity23 did , at every step , was not free of ethical stain
she says politics is full of morally ambiguous choices , but end goal matters
@entity270 : president @entity116 can emulate @entity23 's courage in times of crisis
