@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 police and soldiers on saturday launched major raids in a once - notorious insurgent stronghold west of @entity0			1
saturday 's raids in @entity8 by @entity1 forces were similar to @entity11 - led sweeps in the city in 2004 , shown here			1
a police official in the @entity15 city of @entity8 told @entity2 that a large number of security forces were scouring its @entity19 district for an array of weapons -- machine guns , mortars , rocket - propelled grenades and small arms			1
the @entity19 area , in @entity8 's southeastern section , is an industrial district with factories , scrap yards and large , abandoned yards			1
the area used to be a stronghold of the insurgency in @entity8 until the militants were driven out in major military operations five years ago			0
at that time , the @entity11 - led offensive was largely in response to the brutal ambush , killing and mutilation of four @entity11 security contractors			0
their charred bodies were left dangling from a bridge over the @entity46 in spring 2004			0
in november of that year , @entity11 and @entity1 forces attacked insurgents in @entity8 , killing about 1,200 militants			1
eight @entity1 soldiers and 51 @entity11 troops , mostly @entity52 , died in urban combat , according to the @entity54			1
about 95 percent of @entity8 's population was displaced			0
@entity8 is about 37 miles , or 60 kilometers , west of @entity0 after the city was pacified , the @entity11 committed more than $ 200 million to reconstruction projects there , and changes became evident			0
small cafes and grocery stores lined the streets once dusty and abandoned			0
@entity1 in @entity8 got back to the rhythms of everyday life : they worked , shopped -- and rebuilt			0
as fragile security gains took root , @entity11 military officials marveled at the resurgent city of several hundred thousand			2
on saturday , a police official denied reports that armed groups were trying to re-establish a foothold in the area			2
the @entity11 military said @entity52 and police in the nearby town of @entity79 were also participating in a combined cache sweep			1
violence has dropped in @entity1 , and president @entity83 's administration has been gearing up to withdraw @entity11 troops			0
the @entity11 military continues to be on guard for flare - ups in violence and insurgent activity			2
the vast and predominantly @entity90 province was a battleground between the @entity11 military and @entity93 in @entity1 during the earlier years of the @entity1 war			1
but the insurgents eventually lost ground when a grass - roots movement called " the awakening " emerged			0
the tribe - based awakening forces rejected @entity93 in @entity1 and turned their allegiances toward the @entity11 and @entity1 government			1
while the awakening does n't have clout in @entity8 , there are pockets of support just outside the city , as well as in the rest of the province			0
@entity93 in @entity1 's strongest presence in the country is now in the @entity114 area , in @entity116 province , north of @entity0 .			2
