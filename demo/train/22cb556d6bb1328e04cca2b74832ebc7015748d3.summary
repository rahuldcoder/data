-- are you still shopping for holiday gifts ? then stop right now			1
do n't buy another present before you read this			1
i want to save you from making the biggest holiday gift - giving mistake of your life			1
look , we 've all heard the @entity11 © gift adage : " it 's the thought that counts			1
" but sometimes you truly have to wonder : what the hell was the person thinking when they bought the gift ? did the person just close his or her eyes and buy the first thing they touched ? or maybe they were drunk while shopping ? regardless of the reason , there are too many good people getting bad gifts			1
this is n't about being ungrateful			2
it 's about being honest			2
we have all received gifts that require us to fake a smile as our eyes dart around desperately hoping to locate the receipt			2
i 'm not alone in feeling this way			0
earlier this week , i posted a simple question on @entity35 and @entity36 : have you ever received a bad holiday gift ? the responses were off the charts			1
@entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , etc. -- it did n't matter , you pick the holiday and i can list you a bunch of bad gifts			1
so , i humbly offer to be your gift - giving guide -- sort of like the ghost in @entity51 ' " @entity50			1
" and in keeping with that classic holiday tale , we will start by looking at holidays past in the hopes that you wo n't replicate the gift - giving catastrophes of bygone days			1
do n't give gifts that imply the recipient is fat or needs to improve his or her looks this came up numerous times			1
people thought they were being helpful by surprising their friend or loved one with a gift certificate for a weight loss program like @entity68 or for a personal trainer			1
the most astounding gift was a voucher for a @entity73 treatment given to @entity74 -- she was 26 years old at the time			2
only give these types of gifts if discussed in advance or prepare yourself for the consequences			1
overly practical gifts these were typically given by husbands or boyfriends to their wives or girlfriends			1
here are a few of the gems : an ice scraper for the car , a battery organizer , @entity89 dishes , and my favorite was this gift to @entity97 : a replacement car antenna -- yes , installation was included			2
these gifts are fine if a person asks for it			2
but barring a specific request : no electric can openers as holiday gifts			2
re-gifting nightmares look , we have all re-gifted things			0
but there 's a right way and a dreadfully wrong way to do this			2
here are examples of what not to do			0
a person received a sweater that was not only clearly used , but it smelled like cigarette smoke			0
( yes , the gift - giver was a smoker			1
) and then there 's @entity121 , whose boyfriend gave her a used @entity124 that had been owned by his ex-girlfriend			0
but it gets worse : he actually wrapped it with an old @entity129 because he could n't find wrapping paper			0
re-gifting should be in the original packaging and the gift should look new			0
gifts that have no connection to the person i have a @entity139 friend who was given a holiday gift of a 12 - pound baked ham			1
i 'm not kidding ! another person received thick wool ski socks even though she had never skied and lived in @entity144			0
and then there was the box of chocolates given to @ maverick_kris -- only problem was that he 's diabetic			0
today , most people are on @entity36 , so you can easily see their interests and shop accordingly			0
so if the person has posted on @entity36 " i hate the outdoors , " do n't buy them camping equipment			0
now let me morph into the ghost of holiday gift future and offer you some tips that may be helpful in your gift selection process : 1			0
ask the person what they would like wow , pretty simple right ? yet for some reason in this world of instant communication where we are all connected via e-mail , text , and / or social media , some would prefer to just guess at what the person may like			0
yes , gift cards are fine if you still have no idea what to buy , then pick up a gift card to a major chain store			0
there may have been a time when these seemed like the least thoughtful gift , but i think most would prefer these over cinnamon flavored candles or a re-gifted fern			0
hopefully , my efforts as the ghost of holiday gifts past and future will help you navigate this holiday season			0
after all , if you are going to expend the effort to get someone a holiday gift , then why not give a gift they will truly enjoy and appreciate ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			1

@entity199 : there are too many good people getting bad gifts for holidays
@entity199 : i want to save you from making gift - giving mistakes ; here are four ways
he says do n't give overtly practical gifts and do n't re-gift something that 's been used
