@entity0 -- only hours after she was freed from prison wednesday , @entity3 member @entity2 vowed to continue the kind of political protest act that led to her imprisonment this summer for " hooliganism " alongside two fellow band members			1
the @entity11 punk band members were sentenced in august for performing a song critical of president @entity13 in one of the @entity16 's most important cathedrals in february			1
although @entity2 walked out of the court building wednesday with a suspended sentence , the court upheld the two - year sentences for @entity21 and @entity22			1
previously on @entity1 : two @entity3 members flee @entity11 to ' recruit foreign feminists ' but in an exclusive interview with @entity1 's @entity26 , @entity2 said the punk rock band still has work to do in opposing @entity13			1
" we are not finished , nor are we going to end our political protest , " she said			1
" the situation in the country has deteriorated since our performance and the trial itself is a testimony to that			2
" @entity3 still exists and will carry out more protest performances , she said , adding that rumors of divisions within the group are unfounded			2
" we have to act in such a way that they " -- meaning @entity11 authorities -- " do not learn about concerts ahead of time ... and arrest us , " she said			2
she will be " more cautious " in her actions going forward , @entity2 conceded			1
meanwhile , her " negative " attitude toward @entity13 and what she calls his " mega authoritarian project " remains unchanged , @entity2 said			1
she said the band 's cathedral protest had been intended as a criticism of the support given by senior members of the @entity16 for a third presidential term for @entity13			1
" we believe that we live in a secular society and in this state , the principles of the secular society should be respected , " she said			2
" the representatives of the church should not interfere with the politics of the country , and we wanted to highlight this problem through our action			0
" however , the flash mob - style act was in no way an expression of hatred for the church or its believers , she stressed			2
footage of the brief but provocative protest action -- in which the band members , their faces shrouded by balaclavas , screamed " @entity79 , please drive @entity13 away " inside @entity80 -- attracted wide attention after it was posted online			1
it also outraged many of the country 's faithful			0
the three women , who were arrested shortly after the protest act , were convicted and sentenced for hooliganism			2
two other members of the female punk rock band have fled @entity11			0
@entity2 said the court 's decision to release her with a suspended sentence was a big surprise , and she has " mixed feelings " about being free after more than six months in custody			1
" of course i am very happy to be out and to be free , but i 'm very upset that @entity21 and @entity22 are still incarcerated , " she said			1
although @entity2 is a member of @entity3 and was involved in planning the protest act , she was stopped by a guard on her way into the church and so did not perform the " punk prayer " song , she said			1
public perceptions of private parts : attitudes on women 's bodies this meant that she could not technically be sentenced for dancing at the altar , as the two others were , apparently leading the court to conclude that her sentence should be suspended			1
supporters responded joyfully in the courtroom as her release was announced			0
both @entity21 and @entity22 were very happy for her , @entity2 said , despite the fact they are expected to serve the remainder of their prison terms in different prisons			1
each of them has a young child			0
they are " very , very upset " about being separated from their children , @entity2 told @entity26 , " but they are holding up very well			2
" while in detention , the three young women were held in separate cells with three or four other women , she said			0
they were kept under close scrutiny and recorded at all times to start with , she said , but suffered no physical abuse			0
asked if @entity3 's action had made a difference , @entity2 said she believes it made a lot of people think differently about @entity13 and his policies			1
their trial has also helped expose the flaws in the @entity11 judicial system and how it is influenced by the opinions of the president , @entity2 said			1
wednesday 's court decision came only a week after @entity2 took on a new legal team for the appeal , saying she wanted to push her defense in a different direction			1
speaking outside court , lawyers for @entity21 and @entity22 said they would try to take their case to the @entity156			1
rights group @entity157 said wednesday 's ruling was " only a half - measure in achieving justice " for the women , and called for all three to be released immediately and unconditionally			2
" any decision that shortens the wrongful detention of the three women is welcome			0
but no one should be fooled -- justice has not been done today , " @entity165 , @entity157 's @entity166 and @entity167 deputy program director , said in a statement			0
" the government has introduced numerous new restrictions to freedom of expression in recent months			0
as this decision demonstrates , @entity11 's judiciary is unlikely to offer much protection to those who fall foul of them			0
" the band 's conviction and sentencing garnered an international outcry , with celebrities from @entity186 to @entity187 to @entity188 backing the cause of the strident trio			0
" say what you will about @entity3 : this might not be your kind of music			0
their actions might offend you			0
but this does n't change the fact that freedom of expression , in whatever peaceful form it takes , is a human right , and one on which the protection of other rights rests , " wrote @entity204 of @entity205			0
a judge rejected the women 's defense that their actions were politically motivated , ruling that they had intended to insult the @entity16 and undermine public order			0
an @entity16 leader has been widely reported as saying @entity13 's years in power have been a miracle from @entity217			2
before the hearing last week , the @entity16 appealed for leniency for the band members , according to state - owned @entity221			2
the church believes repentance will " benefit the souls " of the band members , the news agency said			0
@entity11 prime minister @entity226 has called for the members ' release but also said he is " sickened " by their actions			0
@entity1 's @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 contributed to this report .			0
