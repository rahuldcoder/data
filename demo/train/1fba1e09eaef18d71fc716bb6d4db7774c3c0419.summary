-- until last december , no one had ever seen the bottom of the @entity3 , a trench that drops more than four kilometers below the surface of the ocean			1
a group of @entity9 and @entity10 researchers recently spent a month hundreds of kilometers southwest of the @entity12 coast , exploring the fracture 's depths			0
this funnel - shaped sea squirt , never before seen , will snap shut like a @entity16 around shrimp that are unfortunate enough to go near it			1
@entity19 , a professor at @entity20 and one of the project 's lead scientists , remembers sitting in his control room and watching the underwater life on his monitors with a sense of awe			1
once , he says , none of the scientists or pilots said a word for 10 minutes straight as their submersible glided over an undiscovered coral reef full of urchins and sponges and sea stars			1
the researchers explored the fracture with @entity40 , a remotely - operated submersible the size of a small car			1
on loan from the @entity46 , it carried a high - definition camera that weighed more than 500 pounds and beamed underwater video up to the ship through a long fiber - optic tether			1
at 3,000 meters below sea level , the crew saw thousands of sea spiders			1
at 3,500 , millions of specimens of a new , purple - spotted sea anemone			1
at 4,000 meters , a single never - before - seen carnivorous sea squirt with a funnel - shaped body that snapped shut like a @entity16 around any shrimp unfortunate enough to brush against it			1
back on land , the three new species ( the anemone , the sea squirt , and a new kind of barnacle ) have drawn the most attention , but it 's the team 's coral collection , some 10,000 pieces of it , that can tell us about the history of our climate and , perhaps , its future			1
a coral skeleton acts as a tape recorder of its environment			0
as it grows , the coral 's chemical structure ( specifically the weight of its oxygen molecules ) varies depending on the temperature of the water around it			0
and , because the coral 's uranium decays into thorium over time , it is conveniently datable			0
by charting different corals ' ages and oxygen weights , researchers can map the ocean 's changing temperature			1
during the coming months , expedition scientists will compare 40,000 years of oceanic and atmospheric records			2
the ocean 's temperature and carbon dioxide levels are important because of their impact on our atmosphere			2
the watery part of the world absorbs and stores sixty times more co2 than the atmosphere			0
huge reservoirs of the ocean 's co2 lurk in its coldest , densest waters ( found in the @entity3 and off @entity111 )			1
because cold water releases more co2 into the air than warm water , the rate at which bottom water rises to the surface has a profound effect on the atmosphere above			0
until recently , we had assumed that our climate was relatively stable			0
after all , for the past 10,000 years -- during which we developed the alphabet , electrical wiring , and microchip necessary for this article -- little has changed			0
but early - ' 90s research on @entity111 's ice core proved that , over the past 100,000 years , climate stability has been the exception , not the norm			2
during the last glacial period , global temperatures fluttered up and down by as much as several degrees in as little as a decade			0
@entity106 levels in the atmosphere changed along with the temperature , though more slowly			0
the researchers ' ultimate goal is to see if changes in the ocean followed or proceeded changes in the atmosphere			2
@entity143 suspects that the ocean ( and in particular the depths of the ocean ) played a part in triggering the climate 's sudden fluctuations			2
he 's sure , though , that we 're adding more co2 to the ocean now , in the form of burning fossil fuels , than it has ever held before			2
given how little we know about how the ocean regulates the amount of co2 in our air ( we 've mapped the surface of @entity157 , he points out , but not the ocean floor ) he wonders if that 's such a good idea			2
we do know that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the ocean makes it more acidic			0
and whether or not it sets off a climate shift of @entity166 proportions , acidification could kill the researchers ' newly - discovered , awe - inspiring reef , along with others we have n't even found yet			0
there would be just as much ocean to study , but less to find			0

scientists studied the @entity3 , a deep trench in the ocean
they used a remote - controlled machine which sent back video
discoveries *included* a new anemone , the sea squirt and a new kind of barnacle
