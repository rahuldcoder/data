-- beasts of burden , winners of wars and beloved as the sport of @entity7 -- now horses are being used to cure the ills of modern life			2
from the time ancient @entity11 worshiped feline deities , animals have been viewed as a source of strength and healing			1
renowned psychoanalyst @entity18 believed dogs helped his patients relax during sessions , while the @entity22 used dolphins to treat people with mental health disorders in the 1980s			1
today , rabbits , guinea pigs and even the humble gold fish are used to promote a sense of responsibility and wellbeing everywhere from the classroom to the retirement home			2
and an increasing number of mental health patients are turning to horses as a legitimate form of therapy -- claiming impressive results where traditional counseling has failed			1
no longer viewed as simply a crackpot alternative remedy for the rich and famous , equine therapy has gained a devoted following of psychoanalysts who say it has the power to heal people suffering from depression , bipolar disorder , phobias , anger issues and trauma			1
" it used to be seen as ridiculous , an airy fairy treatment used by celebrities with drug and alcohol addictions , " said @entity53 , clinical director at leading @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , based in @entity56 , south west @entity57			2
" but attitudes have changed a lot			2
we 're now a part of the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) for example			2
" the wife of @entity71 presidential candidate @entity70 helped boost equine therapy 's public profile this year when she revealed it helped her overcome depression , after being diagnosed with @entity76 14 years ago			1
@entity77 , who co-owns a horse which competed in the @entity80 dressage competition , told @entity84 's " @entity83 " that horses had motivated her to get out of bed , even in her darkest days			2
across the pond , equine therapy is going from strength to strength , with the @entity89 ( @entity90 ) , originally based in the @entity91 , training more than 1,500 therapists in @entity93 last year			1
the @entity93 arm says they are now seeing hundreds of new inquiries , compared to just a handful a few years ago			1
patients include domestic abuse victims , young offenders and servicemen suffering post traumatic stress -- often turning to their four - legged friends after finding traditional counseling failed them			2
@entity54 ( @entity104 ) usually involves the patient interacting with a horse , alongside a professional councilor and horse handler			2
activities might include discussing the horse 's character , teaching them to jump over obstacles , grooming and cleaning out stables			0
" for a woman who has been a victim of domestic violence , getting the horse to run around her in a circle , may seem simple , but it 's a very powerful thing , " @entity116 , also clinical director at the @entity117 in @entity118 , in south east @entity57 , said			0
" building a relationship with the horse and getting it to respect them , really builds self esteem and confidence			0
" for people who find traditional psychoanalysis too intense , equine therapy can be a way of opening up dialogue with a councilor			1
" the thought of sitting in a room opposite a councilor and telling them the same story again is too much for some people , particularly children , " @entity116 said			0
" but when a horse pays attention to them , they get that sense of trust and love back			0
it enables traditional therapy to happen , rather than being its own thing			1
" however , scientific evidence of its effectiveness remains thin on the ground , and is mostly anecdotal			1
" i 've never heard of a medical referral for equine therapy , " psychotherapist @entity155 , a member of the @entity156 ( @entity156 ) , said			1
" but factors such as being outside and freed from the confines of an office could be tremendously beneficial for the relationship between the patient and therapist			0
" @entity116 recently completed a study in which 40 teenagers from sexually abusive backgrounds were treated with equine therapy once - a - week			1
the youngsters , aged between nine and 14 - years - old , undertook horsemanship training and counselling as part of their eight - week treatment			1
" the change in their behavior was tangible , " @entity116 said			0
" the first week they were looking at the ground , too scared to interact with people			0
" by the end of the last week they were hugging people , dealing with their anger and managing their emotions			1
" for patients coming from traumatic home lives , the fresh air of the great outdoors and chance to socialize , are just as much a part of the healing process as the horses themselves , added @entity116			0
a 14 - year - old girl who was able to overcome her agoraphobia -- a fear of being in public places - was also highlighted by dr @entity196 , managing director at @entity197 in @entity198 , south east @entity57			0
" she had a love of horses , which was the motivating factor for getting her to leave the house , " dr @entity196 said			0
" it helped her build up a relationship with the psychotherapist and work through a lot of issues			1
" " she 's now able to go on shopping trips with her mother and recently went on her first family holiday			0
" however , therapy does n't come cheap , with a 90 - minute session at @entity197 costing Â £ 82 , usually run once - a - week over a six - week course			1
the healing power of horses goes back to an age - old relationship with man , according to @entity220			0
" we 've got this innate connection to horses			0
they 've been our transport , our friends , our beasts of burden , we 've won wars on them , " she said			0
" they 've very social animals and the emotional part of their brain is very large			2
but there 's also a powerful element to them			0
they 're not domestic like dogs or cats , they 're born wild and have to be tamed			0
you have to earn their trust			0
" for some people who have come up against hardship , equine therapy may be just the thing to help them get back in the saddle of life .			1

throughout history , humans have relied on animals as a way of improving mental health
