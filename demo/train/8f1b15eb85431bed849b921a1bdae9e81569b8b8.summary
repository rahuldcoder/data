each time , @entity70 overruled him			2
there can be " no claim of privilege , regardless of the religion , with respect to communications directly relevant to sexual assault of a child , " prosecutor @entity71 said when the judge invited him to respond to @entity6 ' outbursts			1
prosecutors said the tapes show @entity6 offering " celestial marriage " instructions to his young wives , telling them that tending to his needs will bring them closer to @entity66			1

the last , @entity1 ranger @entity162 , took the stand for 10 hours -- laying out the family background of one of the girls , when and where she married @entity6 and the date of her daughter 's birth			1
@entity6 ' trial started last week			1
he remained silent for more than a day of the trial proceedings			0
but on friday , he began repeatedly objecting -- at one point responding with an hourlong speech about his religious freedom " being trampled upon			0
" he objected to an @entity179 agent 's testimony friday on the grounds that it violated religious freedom , claiming @entity179 agents " touched upon what we find sacred to salvation			0
" " this must stop , in a land ... where we maintain the constitutional right of religious freedom , " he said			0
" we are not a fly - by - night religious organization that just appeared within your borders			2
this is sacred to us , and must remain sacred			0
" prosecutors responded that @entity6 ' @entity197 arguments were not valid in this case			1
over frequent interruptions by @entity6 , they argued that freedom of religion does not extend to polygamy or infringing on a child 's rights			1
the judge previously told jurors that she expected the trial could last two to three weeks			2
but that was before @entity6 won the right to represent himself on thursday			2
@entity6 ' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10,000 followers			2
their practice of polygamy , which the mainstream @entity214 renounced more than a century ago , is part of the sect 's doctrine			0
@entity6 was on the @entity179 's @entity218 when he was arrested five years ago during a routine 2006 traffic stop in @entity220			2
he was convicted in @entity221 of two counts of being an accomplice to rape for using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14 - year - old girl into marrying her 19 - year - old cousin			1
afterward , he was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms of five years to life			0
but in july 2010 , the @entity231 overturned his convictions , ruling that the jury instructions were erroneous			0
@entity221 attorney general @entity234 said last week @entity221 is prepared to retry @entity6 , depending on the outcome of the @entity1 case			1
the @entity1 legal proceedings were set off after about 400 children were taken from the sect 's @entity239 in 2008			0
child protection officials said they found a " pervasive pattern " of sexual abuse on the ranch through forced marriages between underage girls and older men			0
but the @entity248 ruled the state had no right to remove the children			0
the court also said the state lacked evidence to show that the children faced imminent danger of abuse			0
most of the children were returned to their families , although some men at the ranch were charged with sexual abuse			0
