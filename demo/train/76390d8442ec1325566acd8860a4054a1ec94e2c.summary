-- the @entity1 has increased embassy security worldwide after the assault that killed the @entity1 ambassador to @entity5 , @entity6 and three other consular officials , and violent protests at @entity1 embassies in @entity10 and @entity11			2
protesters have been angered by a film that mocks @entity15 's @entity14			1
the online film " @entity16 " has attracted widespread condemnation including remarks from @entity10 president @entity19 and @entity21 's foreign ministry			2
violent protests erupt at embassies as @entity1 seeks killers the tension has also provoked comment throughout the press in the @entity29 world			2
@entity0 samples some of the commentaries : @entity32 in an editorial in the online @entity36 language version of the @entity32 , the paper is critical of the violence but adds " ... after a number of similar reactions in recent years to depictions of @entity14 far less offensive , it should no longer be a surprise " more efforts must urgently be made to contain the spread of such hateful media			1
" while the violent outbursts were the work of a small group of religious extremists , the authorities in the @entity1 must also bear some responsibility for what happened , and for the ability of the attackers to breach embassy security in both countries			2
" it is also vital to view the events in @entity5 and in @entity10 within a context , one in which people 's wider anger , religious fervor or boredom -- or a combination of all three -- has been manipulated by a fifth column to further its own interests			2
" if we are to learn anything from these tragic events , it is that greater religious understanding is needed now more than ever			0
" the @entity73 @entity74 , writing in the @entity73 , focuses on the upset caused by the film - maker and calls on the @entity1 government to act			1
" of course , the producer of the film and the actors taking part in the movie knew exactly what they were doing and knew exactly what the result of this would be -- violence and riots , " she says			2
" i call this insinuation of hatred and an act of terror that is wrapped in velvet			0
and do not say that it is about freedom of speech because it is not ! " after 9/11 , the @entity1 has new laws			2
let 's see the @entity1 government use those against non-muslims too			1
" @entity103 @entity104 , writing in the @entity106 newspaper @entity103 , says : " since the fall of the @entity110 regime , the real problem in @entity10 has been having double standards with the street , which is moving without leaders of public opinion			0
" there are leaders who act as political men , not listening to the demands of revolutionaries in the streets , media , and social platforms			2
there , innocent becomes guilty without trial			0
this is the problem with @entity10 today , and it is the obstacle that will stop it from heading towards the future			0
" countries are not constructed on screams , chaos , or revenge , but they are built on wisdom , thinking , and tolerance			0
unfortunately , this is not the case in @entity10 , and that is evident in demonstrators against the @entity1 embassy , who were @entity15 , @entity140 , and even a group of soccer fans			1
" the @entity143 under a headline of " nothing justifies murder , " an editorial in the @entity143 condemns the perpetrators of the attack on the @entity1 embassy in @entity151 and the film - maker " whose sinister objectives are very clear			1
" it says : " the intentions are to denigrate @entity15 , the faith of more than 1.5 billion people , or around one quarter of the world 's population , most of them living peacefully with followers of other faiths			1
the movie certainly targets these people in a manner that aims to disrupt their relations with others who might view them in a negative light			0
" unfortunately such [ a ] job is made easier by a very small minority of @entity175 who advocate violence or the use of force to impose their views on others -- others here being not only non-muslims , but also @entity175 who do not agree with them , meaning the vast majority of the followers of the faith			1
" in @entity15 and for @entity175 , nothing justifies violence and spilling blood of innocent people			1
" @entity189 in @entity191 , @entity190 writes that the @entity192 should take action against the film - maker			1
in an editorial in @entity189 , the paper says : " we appreciate all those who repudiated the film 's director " @entity198 " , whether @entity200 or otherwise			0
his destiny is to live hiding like the non-believer @entity202 , and likewise			0
" we hope the @entity192 will discipline their ribald , and stay away from our religion and honor , and they should understand very well that @entity175 left the ages of humiliation and degradation , and started their journey to gain their dignity and wealth back			0
" these are not holy words , as whoever reads what their scholars write knows what this means exactly			0
" @entity220 in the @entity222 newspaper @entity220 , @entity221 says malice breeds malice			1
" in the age of hatred that erases all logic , it is not a coincidence that a mosque has been desecrated in @entity231 , and @entity175 in the @entity1 have been warned of a ' holocaust '			1
" this film is just one of the many weapons of mass destruction that threaten the @entity237			0
@entity238 brings malice , and if revolution is a fair game then its enemy will be always ready to spread discrimination in the region : among @entity175 and @entity140 , @entity175 and @entity200 , @entity245 and @entity246 , @entity245 and @entity247			1
" the @entity10 gazette an editorial in the @entity36 language @entity250 assesses the way anti- @entity1 hostility has created a leadership test for both president @entity255 and @entity256 ahead of the presidential election			0
" @entity255 , appearing in the @entity259 , somberly condemned the attack on the @entity1 consulate in @entity151 , projected presidential dignity , called on @entity1 to unite and promised action to protect diplomats in the @entity29 world , " it says			0
" but the president 's unspoken political mission was to exploit and enhance perceptions of him as a steely global leader and to shield his own election prospects from immediate damage from any voter outrage at home			0
" it said @entity256 " unloaded on the administration over a statement issued by the @entity1 embassy in @entity278 which effectively condemned a film by a @entity1 director deemed offensive to @entity15 which sparked the riot			1

" more efforts must be made to contain spread of hateful media , " says @entity283 's @entity32
the @entity143 *concludes* : " in @entity15 and for @entity175 , nothing justifies violence and spilling blood of innocent people . "
