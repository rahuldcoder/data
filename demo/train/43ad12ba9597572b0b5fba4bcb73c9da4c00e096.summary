-- as @entity1 makes a whirlwind round of appearances in her last days as secretary of state , one groundbreaking aspect of her work deserves a moment in the spotlight : in a bold departure with tradition , @entity9 made the promotion of equality for gay people a core value of @entity17 foreign policy			1
that is a transformative change , one that advances the cause of human rights around the world -- not just for gays and lesbians , but for everyone			1
the way governments treat their @entity34 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) citizens can tell us much about their overall approach to human rights and democracy			1
mistreatment of sexual minorities is a microcosm of greater repression			0
take a look at the gruesome spectacle of young gay men executed by the government of @entity47 in the streets , for all to see			0
or , look at the new anti-gay laws coming into effect in @entity52 's increasingly authoritarian regime			0
it is no accident that the growing repression of @entity34 @entity52 coincides with a dramatic deterioration of political freedom and what the nonpartisan @entity60 called " the return of the iron fist in @entity52			2
" it is clear that gays and lesbians are the canaries in the coal mine of human rights			1
when gays live under pressure , everyone should worry			0
that , however , is not how @entity9 explained it 14 months ago , when she stood before the @entity71 in @entity72 , in front of an audience filled with representatives from @entity77 and @entity78 countries , from places where homosexuality is a crime , even one punishable by death , and declared that gay rights and human rights " are one and the same			1
" gay people , she explained , deserve equality simply because everyone does			0
it was @entity91 , the commemoration of the signing of the 1948 @entity94 , and she used the occasion to send a message to the world on behalf of the @entity17			0
she declared unequivocally that there is no exception for gay people when it comes to human rights			1
opinion : president @entity1 ? if she wants it she admitted that the @entity17 record on human rights for gays and lesbians " is far from perfect			1
" but by proclaiming , without caveat or qualification , the @entity17 stance on the issue , she sent a signal to the rest of the world that , while equality for gay people is far from reached , the rightness of the goal is beyond debate , much like it is with equal rights for women or for racial minorities			1
in doing this , she announced it was now the official policy of the @entity17 government to promote the rights of @entity34 people everywhere			1
@entity9 has always been a couple of steps ahead of president @entity131 when it comes to gay rights			2
it 's a safe bet she persuaded him to jump on board and put the full force of the administration behind this new policy			0
in @entity72 that day , she announced that the president had instructed all @entity17 government agencies working in other countries to " combat the criminalization of @entity34 status and conduct " to help protect vulnerable @entity34 , helping refugees and asylum seekers and responding to abuses			1
today , @entity17 diplomats , as part of their official mandate and as an explicit tenet of @entity17 values , must speak up for the rights of individuals experiencing persecution on the basis of their sexual orientation , as when a couple were sentenced in @entity162 for " looking " gay			2
news : @entity1 talks future ' adventures ' @entity17 may be not as influential as it once was , but no country carries more weight ; there 's not even a close second			2
@entity17 's opinion matters if you want foreign aid or political assistance			2
but it matters even more to people on the ground , eager , perhaps desperate to make their case before the authorities , their boss or their family			0
in the latter case , that it was the popular and respected @entity1 making the argument undoubtedly made a difference on a personal level , even if dictators did not relent			0
@entity9 also noted that " being gay is not a @entity189 invention ; it is a human reality , " and noted nations that have enacted protections for their gay citizens , including @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196			2
it was a rebuke to that tragicomic moment in 2007 , when @entity47 president @entity206 told an audience in @entity208 , " in @entity47 , we do not have homosexuals like you do in your country , " prompting an explosion of laughter from the crowd			0
of course , gay people live in @entity47 , where homosexuality is punishable by death			0
@entity17 's stance , promoted so passionately by @entity9 , is gradually becoming the global standard for human rights			1
under intense lobbying from @entity17 , the usually feckless and frequently counterproductive @entity71 adopted a measured entitled " ending violence based on @entity217 and @entity218 , " and another supporting equality , important symbols that this is a standard for the entire world			2
@entity9 moved the issue of equality for members of the @entity34 community to the front of @entity17 's diplomatic agenda ; in the process , she gave a boost to human rights for all and a considerable nudge to the inexorable progress of freedom			1
let 's hope her successor does n't let up			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			0

@entity243 : as secretary of state , @entity9 made equality for gays a foreign policy value
she says treatment of @entity34 citizens is a microcosm of a nation 's human rights approach
she says @entity9 used @entity17 sway to advance lgbt rights as global standard
