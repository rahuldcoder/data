@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was on the stumps of his amputated legs when he knocked down a locked toilet door with a cricket bat to reach his shot girlfriend , a police forensic expert said wednesday , countering the track star 's assertion he was wearing his prosthetic legs at the time			1
@entity1 police colonel @entity13 took the stand to discuss marks on a cricket bat and a bent steel plate found in the bathroom door after the athlete shot model @entity20 on @entity21 last year			1
wielding the cricket bat in his hands , @entity22 squatted down before swinging it at the actual wooden door in a court reconstruction to show the angle of the marks			1
he said the location of the spots on the door was consistent with @entity3 not wearing his prosthetic legs			1
" from the forensic evidence , he was on his stumps , " @entity13 said			0
defense attorney @entity35 countered by suggesting that even with his prosthetic legs on , @entity3 would not be swinging a bat at the same height as an able - bodied person			1
in a change from his bail hearing , when the state based its case for a premeditated murder charge on @entity3 having had his prosthetic legs on when he fired the shots , the prosecution said wednesday he was on his stumps during the shooting and when he bashed down the door			1
the track star has said he did n't have his prosthetics on when he shot at the toilet door after hearing a noise , but then put them on when he tried to break open the door , realizing his girlfriend may be inside			2
the door is being used in the @entity0 court to show the trajectory of the bullets fired at @entity20 , which both sides can use to argue whether it was premeditated murder or not			1
@entity3 , the first double - amputee to run in the @entity64 , regularly wears prosthetic legs			1
if he was not wearing them at the time , the trajectory of the bullets would be lower and the defense can argue that he was feeling vulnerable and did n't have time to think			2
the 27 - year old has pleaded not guilty to murder in the shooting			1
he admits killing @entity20 , 29 , by shooting her through a locked bathroom door in his house			1
however , he says that he mistook her for a burglar in the middle of the night and that the shooting was a tragic mistake			0
@entity3 has said he tried to break open the door when he realized he 'd shot @entity20			2
door in focus the court heard that the door was intact before the shots were fired			0
under cross-examination , @entity13 said the first and only time he went to the crime scene was on march 8 , 2013 , nearly a month after the shooting			0
asked about a mark on the door which he did not investigate , he said it was not from a cricket bat			0
@entity35 asserted it was the mark of a prosthetic leg kicking the door with a sock on and that fabric remained in the mark on the door			0
@entity13 was unwilling to accept that that was the only possible explanation			0
@entity13 told the court there were footprints consistent with police shoes on the bathroom door at one point and photos of this were shown			2
they were later removed and @entity13 said he did not know how			0
he said that from photos , he knew the door was removed from its hinges and left on the floor for some time			0
when @entity35 suggested they were wiped off by someone who did not know the importance of police procedure , @entity13 chuckled			0
close - up photographs of the damaged door were shown in court , as well as scuffs on the autographed cricket bat , prompting a tweet from former @entity1 test cricketer @entity124 : â €			2
