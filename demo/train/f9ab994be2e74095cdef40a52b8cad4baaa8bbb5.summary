@entity0 always understood that the old ways would no longer do			1
he had witnessed the errors of 20th century dictatorship firsthand as a @entity5 agent stationed in @entity6 during the last years of the @entity7			2
the young @entity9 officer was shocked at how " totally invasive " the @entity12 police state 's surveillance was of its own citizens			1
in 2000 , reflecting on those years on the eve of his first term as @entity17 's president , @entity0 said , " i only regretted that the @entity9 had lost its position in @entity19 , although intellectually i understood that a position built on walls and dividers can not last			1
but i wanted something different to rise in its place			0
and nothing different was proposed			0
" more than a decade later , something different has risen to replace the totalitarian models of old			1
modern strongmen are more sophisticated and cunning then their twentieth - century predecessors			1
these savvy authoritarians eschew the most heavy - handed methods -- mass executions , disappearances , brutal crackdowns -- as an extreme last resort			1
instead , subtle forms of coercion are preferred			0
rather than have its activists roughed up , a human rights organization is more likely to be shuttered for fire - code violations			1
these regimes are fluent in the language of democracy and human rights , and may even establish human rights commissions -- despite being the chief perpetrators of any abuses			1
laws are written in vague terms and then applied capriciously against those who question the regime 's ways			1
and fear is always a potent weapon			0
" my father used to say that he would rather live in a dictatorship like @entity60 , " one @entity56 activist told me			0
" at least there you know if you criticized the government , they would put you in prison			0
here they rule through uncertainty			0
" of course , elections are de rigueur in modern dictatorships -- and not the absurd sham polls of the @entity9 that always left @entity72 with 99 percent of the vote			1
today the ballot stuffing usually stops at 70 percent			0
everyone understands that it is better to appear to win a genuine election -- which means you need the opposition to win some votes -- than to participate in a clear charade			1
there is something @entity84 about the way that authoritarianism has evolved			0
because , in many ways , it has never been harder to be a dictator			0
in the past 20 years , the democracy promotion business boomed			0
many dictatorships lost their chief lifeline with the collapse of the @entity9			1
the internet , satellite communication , and smart phones make it incredibly difficult for a regime to keep its worst crimes secret			0
in 1989 , the @entity99 tried to strong - arm @entity100 off the air before they mowed down protesters on the roads leading to @entity104			1
if people assembled in the square today , the regime 's response would be captured on a thousand iphones			2
in response to these pressures , the smartest regimes did not close themselves off from the world or seek to become the next @entity114			2
police states hold no appeal			0
in @entity17 , the @entity118 has responded to protests by passing a raft of laws that enable the authorities to squash activists with fines and prison sentences			0
in @entity56 , @entity126 has engineered the electoral rules with some of the world 's most sophisticated gerrymandering			1
in @entity131 , the government has proposed one reform after another -- without ever curbing the monarchy 's true power			2
in @entity136 , the @entity99 altered its social compact with its people , granting them greater personal freedoms in exchange for keeping tight control of their political rights			0
in @entity145 , the ruling party promised to relax its rule -- right before it banned street demonstrations			0
when people responded in protest , prime minister @entity148 referred to them as a " sign of a mature democracy			0
" it was the perfectly tailored reply of the modern authoritarian			2
in a world of unfettered information and open borders , we should understand authoritarian regimes for what they are			2
they are not the outgrowth of a certain culture , history , or level of economic development			0
rather , they are conscious , man - made projects that must be carefully built , polished , and reinforced			2
but it makes no difference if a regime has developed innovative strategies , political tools , or social controls if it does n't use them			2
no matter how sophisticated these regimes may be , some are finding that their methods are wearing thin			1
since the announcement of @entity0 's return for a third presidential term 12 months ago , @entity0 and the @entity118 have demonstrated a remarkably tin ear			1
the trial of @entity183 is just the most recent example where the regime has appeared flatfooted -- unnecessarily politicizing issues that make it appear overweening and abusive			0
@entity0 has now lost the support of much of the urban middle class and young people -- a group that always polled highly for @entity0 -- and his ruling party 's brand is in shambles			1
as one activist told me , " it is no longer cool to be @entity196			0
" that is an important loss for a regime that banks on the apathy of its citizens			0
in @entity56 , @entity126 's prospects are in question			2
the past month has been his worst politically , with a string of disasters and accidents that underline how much the state has crumbled under his watch			0
workers -- if ever he had a core constituency -- recently booed @entity217 at a rally			0
although his control of the media , oil wealth , and state machinery keeps him formidable , it is increasingly clear ( to @entity56 of all political stripes ) that the country is reaching a breaking point			0
of course , @entity227 offers a daily reminder that some dictatorships still opt for a bloodbath			1
in 1982 , @entity231 brutally ended an uprising in the @entity227 city of @entity234			1
it is estimated that between 10,000 and 40,000 @entity227 were slaughtered in a month			1
@entity236 chose to follow his father 's example in crushing his own rebellion			2
the difference is that in 1982 the elder @entity231 could be confident that he could perpetrate his crimes with impunity			1
his son 's regime looks less tenable by the day			2
no matter what happens , @entity231 's government will never win back its legitimacy			1
apparently @entity231 never learned that the old ways would no longer do .			1

@entity250 : sophisticated authoritarians replacing old totalitarian regimes
@entity254 , election - fixing , *legislation* are tools of the modern strongmen , @entity250 says
despite their sophistication , methods of regimes like @entity0 's are wearing thin
@entity250 : @entity227 's @entity231 is reminder that some dictatorships still prefer a bloodbath .
