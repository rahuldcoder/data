-- the @entity2 season encourages us to think of @entity4 , so highly revered and loved by both @entity5 and @entity6			1
so it is even more tragic to contemplate relations between the two religions today -- and particularly the plight of @entity5 in the @entity6 world			1
in @entity13 , savage killings of @entity5 have led thousands to flee the country			1
in @entity16 , @entity5 are under severe pressure and siege			1
in @entity20 , there are too many cases like that of @entity23 , a @entity5 woman who is facing a death sentence under @entity20 's blasphemy laws for allegedly slandering the @entity26			1
for both of us , a @entity6 and a @entity5 , this violence is a matter of utmost gravity			1
one of us , @entity32 , was educated by @entity34 priests at @entity35 , in @entity20 , and then presbyterian teachers at @entity37 in @entity38 , and gratefully acknowledges the immeasurable debt he owes them , which he attempts to repay in promoting @entity5 - @entity6 dialogue			1
the other , @entity42 , is concerned as a bishop but also as someone also passionately devoted to promoting good relations between @entity5 and @entity6			1
we find that the situation has reached a breaking point because of the crisis in the @entity6 world			0
extremist muslims feel that @entity51 is under siege by the @entity53 and seek to lash out at @entity5 , seeing an attack on @entity5 in their countries effectively as an attack on @entity57 , @entity59 troops in @entity13 or the intelligence agencies behind @entity59 drone strikes in @entity20			1
since 9/11 , we have been speaking out in support of interfaith dialogue and understanding the deep bonds between @entity65 and @entity51			0
the @entity66 named @entity5 , as he did the @entity67 , as " people of the book , " to be respected			1
in @entity51 , @entity4 embodies compassion and the love of @entity72 and is miraculously born of the @entity73			2
not only is @entity4 mentioned in the @entity74 more often than the @entity26 , but an entire chapter is devoted to the @entity73			0
as no other figure in @entity51 , @entity4 can perform miracles , including giving sight to the blind , breathing life into a piece of clay , bringing the dead to life , and curing a leper ( @entity74 3:49 )			2
@entity6 will say that they can not be a good muslim without first being a good jew and a good @entity5			2
@entity5 have always lived in @entity6 lands ; indeed @entity65 is older than @entity51 in these areas			1
@entity5 living in the great societies of @entity51 history , including @entity92 and the @entity93 , largely lived in peace and security according to their own laws			2
yet in the past few years , the persecution of @entity5 has increased in scope and frequency			0
the @entity13 @entity5 population , one of the oldest in the world and said to date from just after the crucifixion of @entity4 , has sharply decreased			1
before the @entity105 , more than 1 million @entity5 lived in @entity13 ; at the time of the @entity59 invasion of @entity13 , the number had fallen to about 800,000			2
two - thirds of those are estimated to have fled			0
the @entity5 who have remained are subjected to pogroms and slaughter by @entity6 groups who are committed to exterminating them			2
the @entity114 has reported high numbers of @entity5 refugees fleeing @entity13 in recent weeks , and it has been noted that the chaotic aftermath of @entity59 's invasion may result in what all other invaders had failed to accomplish : the elimination of @entity13 's @entity5 population			2
in @entity16 , where @entity5 constitute 10 % of the population , @entity5 girls are being kidnapped by shadowy @entity6 groups and lured into @entity6 marriages , with the state looking the other way			1
christians in @entity16 have no problem converting to @entity51 , but if @entity6 want to convert to @entity65 , they are refused permission to register as @entity5 on their id cards , where religion must be stated			1
riots are common , and @entity16 @entity5 live in fear for their lives			0
@entity23 's death sentence in @entity20 has gathered fierce support from certain @entity6 groups , who are demanding the sentence be carried out			0
the blasphemy law is derived from laws passed during @entity20 's " @entity149 " phase under president @entity145 , in which @entity51 warriors were being trained to fight the @entity147 in @entity148			0
it has constantly been misused by @entity151 seeking to attack each other in local feuds , and in today 's high @entity155 atmosphere has increased pressure on the @entity5 tenfold			0
@entity151 president @entity157 must pardon @entity23 immediately and bring this disgraceful episode to a close			0
with this in mind , it is impossible for good @entity6 to be anti-christian			0
we are appalled by the persecution christians are being subjected to and appeal to @entity6 to look to their own faith for how they should treat @entity5 in their midst			0
we need true @entity51 scholarship and learning , not ignorant people quoting holy texts out of context			0
anger or frustration at the way the @entity53 is behaving in the @entity6 world or at their own governments is no excuse for slaughtering and slandering @entity5			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

@entity32 , @entity42 : @entity184 deep between @entity5 and @entity6 ; both faiths revere @entity4
yet , @entity5 being savagely killed in @entity13 , under siege in @entity16 and @entity20 , they say
@entity189 named @entity5 , as he did @entity67 , as respected " people of the book , " they write
writers : @entity51 scholars need to speak out against extremists behind persecutions
