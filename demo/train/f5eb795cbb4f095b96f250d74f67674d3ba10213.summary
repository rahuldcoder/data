the flu season is at the midway point , and it 's shaping up to be a difficult one , according to the @entity4			1
at a press conference friday in @entity7 , @entity4 director dr. @entity5 said the season has been particularly bad for people 65 and older			2
@entity5 also said that five more children have died since the @entity4 last reported figures , bringing the number of pediatric deaths up to 26 since the flu season began in the fall			1
the deaths , however , are believed to be higher due to delays in reporting			2
adult deaths are not tracked , but the @entity4 said that the elderly and people with underlying health conditions are vulnerable to this strain of the flu			1
@entity5 advises doctors to treat people who are sick with the flu with anti-viral medications			2
anti-viral medications are dramatically under prescribed and could prevent thousands of hospitalizations and may even save people from death , he said			0
but pediatrician @entity32 cautions that " not everyone needs antivirals			0
" she said , " they are mostly recommended for those who are most at risk for complications , " meaning the very young or old			0
@entity5 said some doctors do n't think the medications work , but if given early , they help ease some of the symptoms of the flu			0
the @entity4 had predicted the season would be a bad one after most of the samples taken from people with the flu tested positive for the @entity47 strain			1
that strain of virus is " nastier , " according to @entity5 , and generally makes people sicker and results in more hospitalizations and deaths			0
the @entity4 reports that most states are seeing widespread cases of flu			2
in states where the flu season started earlier , it may be slowing down , but there are still weeks of flu left			1
the flu season usually lasts into the spring			1
with that in mind , @entity5 suggests to go get a flu shot if you have n't been vaccinated			0
the flu shot this year is not a perfect match for the virus that mutated , but it is the best protection available for people and can lessen the severity of the illness .			0

flu season has been hard on elderly and those with underlying medical conditions
there have been 26 pediatric deaths since flu season began in fall , @entity4 says
