@entity0 -- a civilian mortician who was recently demoted for misconduct in handling remains of the @entity3 military 's war dead has resigned , the @entity3 @entity2 said friday			1
@entity10 , who worked at the @entity3 military mortuary in @entity12 , @entity13 , was among three supervisors who " illegally tried to suppress ( three employees ' ) disclosures and punish them for their whistleblowing " about mismanagement and mishandling of human remains , the independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency said in a statement			1
" it is not surprising that mr. @entity10 chose to resign , " the agency said			1
" the @entity2 's report of investigation , which will be made public in mid-march and which the @entity27 received in late january , found that mr. @entity10 retaliated against the whistleblowers			1
" the special counsel 's office is awaiting the final decisions by senior @entity3 @entity27 officials on disciplinary action for the two other supervisors , who remain on staff , the agency said			1
the office has been investigating claims by three of the whistleblowers that the @entity27 retaliated against them for bringing up the problems , in one case attempting to terminate the employment of one of them			1
" the government needs to listen to employees who come forward with serious allegations of wrongdoing , " special counsel @entity46 said in a statement			0
" and it needs to take disciplinary action when supervisors suppress or punish whistleblowers			1
failure to do so sends a chilling message			0
" in november , a @entity59 official confirmed that @entity10 , a civilian , was demoted to a non-supervisory job and was working in another area at @entity12 outside the mortuary			1
another civilian , @entity63 , a mortician and funeral director there , was transferred to a non-supervisory job			1
col. @entity67 , the mortuary commander between january 2009 and october 2010 when the incident occurred , was issued a letter of reprimand			0
a year - long @entity27 investigation into whistleblowers ' 14 allegations of wrongdoing involving four @entity3 service members killed in action found that @entity77 sawed off the arm of a dead @entity79 without consulting the @entity79 's family			1
the body was being prepared for viewing by his family and had a badly damaged arm , whose bone had fused at a 90 - degree angle , a @entity59 official said			1
the @entity27 found no wrongdoing and officials say preparing badly damaged bodies can be very difficult			1
but the federal @entity2 , which also investigated the matter , said the family should have been notified , according to a statement issued by that office tuesday			2
in november , @entity3 @entity27 investigators found " serious misconduct " in the handling of remains of the nation 's war dead at the @entity102 , special counsel 's office said			1
air force chief of staff gen. @entity104 referred to " gross mismanagement " in some aspects of the mortuary 's operations			0
secretary of defense @entity109 appointed a panel to review operations at the @entity12 mortuary , @entity104 said then			0
the @entity27 investigation confirmed several of the allegations from whisteblowers , including several instances in which portions of remains from troops killed in action were lost or unaccounted for			1
it included losing an ankle that had been in storage and some bags that held other body parts and remains			0
a @entity59 official confirmed that elements of the @entity129 and @entity27 were criticized for shipping fetal remains from military families to @entity12 in cardboard boxes			1
at a news conference in november , @entity104 said the investigation began after allegations from three employees " became known to us			0
" he did not identify the employees or their positions			0
but the report from the @entity2 identified the three as @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142			0
the @entity27 said all three are still employed by @entity102			1
" the fundamental result of the investigation was that senior @entity27 mortuary operations affairs officials did not meet standards in that they failed to act with clear indications that processes and procedures ... were inadequate to ensure accountability of remains , " @entity104 said in november			1
he said among their findings , investigators " concluded that the loss of two specific portions of remains constituted gross mismanagement			2
" those two cases involved the remains of an @entity129 soldier and those of an @entity27 airman			1
" in one case we have reason to believe that the remains were properly disposed of ; in the second case , we can not make that argument			0
it is simply unknown what happened to the second set of remains , " @entity104 said			0
" this gross mismanagement dealt with the fact that ... supervisors , of which there were three , failed to properly perceive and then act upon ... clear indications that there were systemic issues with respect to accountability of remains in the mortuary			2
" special counsel @entity46 said in november that the @entity27 had n't taken " sufficient disciplinary action against the officials responsible for wrongdoing , " according to an @entity2 statement			1
but @entity104 said last year that he did not believe the situations cited in the report were intentional			0
he emphasized that " this was difficult work , 24/7			0
and while their performance did not meet standards , this was not a deliberate act , in my personal view			0
" the @entity27 said in november that it is improving procedures at @entity12 but admitted that " the mortuary staff failed to maintain accountability while processing remains for three service members			1
" " while it is likely that the disposition of remains was by appropriate method , it could not be shown that it was in accordance with the families ' directions , " the @entity27 said in a statement in november			1
@entity109 noted that " one of the @entity59 's most sacred responsibilities is ensuring that the remains of our fallen heroes are recovered and returned to their families with the honor and dignity they have earned			0
" i was deeply disturbed to learn about questions involving the possibilities of improper handling and preparation of remains of four service members at the @entity27 's @entity229 , " @entity109 said in a statement last year			1
the @entity2 said last year that while the @entity27 investigation " confirmed most of the whistleblower 's factual allegations , " it " nonetheless failed to admit wrongdoing			2
" " the @entity27 did , however , respond positively by changing numerous practices at the mortuary , " the @entity2 said in a statement			2
the @entity2 said that in the incidents in which " three body parts of service members killed while on active duty were lost by the @entity229 , " the @entity27 acknowledged its " negligent failure , " but " still concluded that there was no obligation to notify the families			2
" the @entity2 also criticized last year the handling of some fetal remains from military families that " were shipped to @entity12 inside plastic pails , which were in turn placed in non-reinforced , used cardboard boxes , even though military guidelines require that remains be treated with ' reverence , care and dignity			0
' " the @entity27 acknowledged that this handling was ' substandard ' and that it ' was n't very dignified , ' but nevertheless said the remains were afforded the requisite reverence , care and dignity , " an @entity2 statement said			2
the remains of those killed in @entity265 and @entity266 have regularly been flown to @entity12 since the wars began			0
more than 6,300 deceased individuals have been returned there			0
due to combat injuries , remains are often difficult to identify and officials have long acknowledged that @entity12 does retain some human remains and parts that are so damaged they are not possible to identify			0
" the mortuary for the @entity276 military should boast the best conditions and best practices of any mortuary , " @entity46 said			0
" these events are deeply troubling , as is the @entity27 's failure to acknowledge culpability			2
" in a letter to president @entity284 , the @entity2 said the report " demonstrates a pattern of the @entity27 's failure to acknowledge culpability for wrongdoing relating to the treatment of remains of service members and their dependents			2
while the report reflects a willingness to find paperwork violations and errors , with the exception of the cases of missing portions , the findings stop short of accepting accountability for failing to handle remains with the requisite ' reverence , care , and dignity befitting them and the circumstances			0
' " the @entity27 has contacted families of the war dead and @entity104 has asked @entity109 for an independent assessment of mortuary operations at @entity12			1
former surgeon general @entity312 was to lead that investigation and provide a report to @entity109			0
@entity104 said that he and @entity27 secretary @entity316 " have taken personal responsibility for this			2
" " i want to assure our men and women in uniform , and the @entity3 public , that the @entity27 mortuary standards they expect for our fallen heroes are being met , " @entity104 said in a statement			2
the @entity27 has set up a toll free number for the families of fallen service members to call if they have questions about the investigation			2
they can call 1 855 637 2583 or e-mail dover.pm@pentagon.af.mil			0
