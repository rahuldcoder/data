-- in 2007 , when the @entity3 property market was booming and former headhunter @entity4 was between jobs , he received an interesting request			2
" i was asked to put ads on the pavement in front of ( real ) estate agents ' offices , " he said			2
advertising was something he 'd started thinking about in his already budding entrepreneurial streak			2
@entity15 -- the @entity17 equivalent of @entity18 -- the free online classifieds where viewers can buy and sell almost anything , wanted to do a " clean advertising " campaign in seven @entity17 cities			0
the goal was to get consumers to advertise directly through @entity15 instead of going through a real estate agent			0
the ads were literally cleaned onto dirty pavement at target locations			0
" it was cheeky , a bit more edgy than the normal campaign , " said @entity4			0
" i 'm not sure they ( real estate agents ) appreciated it			0
" the campaign went extremely well , sales of homes advertised directly on @entity15 went up by 800 % , he said			0
what happened next was an explosion of media attention			0
one thing led to another and he found himself doing campaigns for @entity46 in the @entity47 and @entity48 , among others			0
@entity4 says those jobs let him grow his " @entity51 , " a company focusing on outdoor advertising campaigns including @entity54 , street graffiti and grass advertising			1
one of its best - known campaigns was the " @entity59 , " a giant @entity62 face spray painted on a hill in @entity64 for @entity65			1
the business has grown swiftly and this year @entity4 decided he needed to hire an experienced sales director and also move his @entity69 - based company to a bigger office to house his dozen employees			1
before doing this : " i wanted to make sure we had the money in the bank , " explained @entity4			1
local banks did n't seem to grasp his business plan , he said			0
so in august he put his company on @entity80 -- the largest peer - to - peer business lender in the @entity17 -- applied for £ 40,000 ( $ 70,000 ) , watched investors bid and within days he had his loan			1
it has a 9 % interest rate , he says , as opposed to the commercial banks who wanted to charge 10 - 13 %			1
there are many different models of peer - to - peer ( @entity91 ) lending , but essentially @entity91 websites let businesses borrow money directly from individuals , without going through a traditional financial institution such as a bank			1
@entity80 has 5,500 businesses registered and has lent more than £ 300 million ( $ 488 million ) since it started			1
the company is projecting massive growth			0
while banks still provide the majority of lending in the @entity17 -- over 85 % -- @entity80 is confident it can seize a big percentage of that			2
" we look to take a large chunk of that over the next five to 10 years , " said @entity105 , a company spokeswoman			2
@entity80 says the @entity91 business lending industry is tripling in size every year , and has the potential to be worth over £ 12 billion ( $ 19.5 billion ) a year in the @entity17 in the next 10 years , according to research by @entity113 , a charity focused on innovative businesses and ideas			1
@entity117 and @entity118 are the two largest p2p lenders in the @entity119 , with a majority of the market			0
they issued $ 2.4 billion in loans in 2013 , up significantly from $ 871 million in 2012			2
what 's more , a recent report by venture capital firm @entity124 predicts the global market for @entity91 lending could be worth over $ 1 trillion by 2025			1
different @entity91 websites advertise different levels of returns , but @entity80 said whether it 's a small one - off investment ( there is a £ 20 ( $ 34 ) minimum ) or a large investment from a savvy lender , the net return on average is about 6.4 % after fees and bad debt are accounted for			1
bad debt is a hazard of this kind of lending , as is the possibility that the @entity91 website itself will go bust , but the industry is becoming increasingly regulated and @entity91 services include various risk mitigation systems			1
" there is a risk			0
it 's an investment product , not a savings product , " said @entity152			0
despite this , many investors want to lend locally , or support a particular industry or an ethical business and can do this easily in the @entity91 model , she said			1
for another creative company , it was a matter of cash flow and not being paid on time which prompted it to look at another p2p lender , @entity167			2
this online marketplace allows businesses to " auction " their invoices to investors , who bid to provide capital against the as - yet - unpaid earnings			1
@entity3 - based @entity175 , an interior and graphic design company for the food and beverage industry , said it turned to @entity167 in 2012 as a way to get finance against its design invoices			1
" we 've always looked at various forms of funding apart from conventional banking			0
but unfortunately in the design business , because we 're not doing anything tangible , our services are time and ideas , " said @entity186 , financial director for @entity175			2
" @entity167 was the first company that came up with a viable option and said ' you can sell your invoices and release that cash very , very quickly ' , " said @entity186			0
@entity175 , whose client list is long and includes major @entity17 brands @entity200 , boots and @entity203 , as well as @entity204 gourmet food shop in the @entity119 , said facing late payments from clients in its business " could be catastrophic			0
" " people still do n't pay their bills on time , but it ( @entity91 ) has given us an avenue to remove that stress , " said @entity186			1
" it 's our painkiller			0

peer - to - peer finance lets businesses *bypass* bank loans
creative companies with quirky ideas find new lending models advantageous
the @entity91 industry looks set to grow at *incredible* speed over the next few years
