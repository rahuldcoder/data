@entity0 , @entity1 -- seven republicans will be on the stage monday night at the @entity2 / @entity7 / @entity6 presidential debate , but one candidate will likely be the center of attention			1
thanks to his standing at the top of the most recent horse race polls , his fundraising prowess and his top - flight campaign organization , former @entity12 gov. @entity11 is generally considered the front - runner at this early point in the battle for the @entity23 nomination			1
according to a @entity25 survey released monday morning , @entity11 -- who 's making his second @entity28 bid -- grabbed the support of 24 % of @entity23 and independents who lean toward the @entity23			1
former @entity32 gov. @entity31 is second with 20 % , followed by former @entity34 mayor @entity33 and the rest of the field			0
but @entity11 's standing skyrockets to 35 % -- 19 points ahead of the rest of the field -- when @entity31 and @entity33 , both of whom are still on the fence about the race , are taken out of the mix. poll : @entity11 at top of @entity23 field because of his front - runner status and nagging questions among conservatives about the health care law he instituted in @entity12 , expect @entity11 to have a bull 's - eye on his back tonight in the early primary state he needs to win if he hopes to be the nominee			1
here 's what to watch for : @entity60 's target : @entity61 for months , former @entity62 gov. @entity60 has shied away from direct attacks on @entity11 but that 's about to change			1
@entity60 signaled over the weekend that he intends to step up his criticism of @entity11 in hopes of making inroads with fiscal conservatives who might be uncomfortable with the former @entity12 governor			1
the mild - mannered @entity60 needs to start drawing the contrast : despite hiring a blue - chip staff and spending significant time in the first - to - vote states of @entity74 and @entity1 , he remains a single - digit blip in most state and national polls			1
so @entity60 took sharp aim at @entity11 during a @entity80 appearance sunday , tying president @entity82 's health care law to @entity11 's health care legislation in @entity12			1
" the president 's own words is that he patterned in large measure ' @entity87 ' after what happened in @entity12 , " @entity60 said			0
" what i do n't understand is they both continue to defend it			0
" @entity60 lumped both laws together with the invention of a new term : " @entity95			0
" he repeated the criticism later sunday at a campaign stop in @entity1			2
expect to hear more health care talk from @entity60 during monday 's debate			2
the @entity101 relaunch @entity11 will be the center of attention on monday night , but former house speaker @entity104 might have the most to prove			1
@entity101 's entire senior staff abandoned his campaign last week , citing the candidate 's questionable work ethic and fundraising ability			1
and yet , @entity101 has vowed to march on with his bid ; he now has to prove that he can effectively run campaign the way he wants			1
strong performances in nationally televised debates were always key to @entity101 's @entity28 hopes			2
but in the wake of last week 's campaign implosion , he must use monday 's forum not just to show off his presidential timbre			2
he has to demonstrate that his candidacy is still viable			0
ready for @entity120 ? longtime @entity122 congressman @entity121 is making his third bid for the @entity28			0
@entity121 has devoted and energetic followers , but he is thought to be somewhat out of the mainstream of @entity23 politics thanks to his calls to scale back @entity129 military efforts abroad and his crusade to get rid of the @entity131			0
but in the aftermath of the 2010 midterms , which saw @entity23 make gains up and down the ballot after running campaigns built on scaling back the size of government , @entity121 insists that @entity23 are moving toward his proposals			0
he pressed that message while on the campaign trail in @entity1 on friday			2
" some people say , ' why do n't you make your message more mainstream ? ' " he said			0
" well , my message is becoming more mainstream			0
" @entity121 will try to make that case to a national audience tonight			0
@entity150 's debut @entity129 rep. @entity150 of @entity62 has yet to form an exploratory committee , but all signs point to a @entity23 presidential bid			1
she is expected to launch a campaign in @entity155 , @entity74 -- the town in which she was born -- in the coming weeks			2
she has lined up veteran @entity23 strategists @entity158 and pollster @entity159 to help run her political operation			0
and @entity150 has already proved that she can stir the passions of conservative voters in a way that others in the @entity23 field can not			1
@entity150 is already a national figure thanks to her frequent cable news appearances and unabashed criticism of @entity82			1
but establishment @entity23 have questioned whether a three - term member of @entity171 with a meager legislative record and a tendency for over-the - top rhetoric can go toe - to - toe with some of the political veterans seeking the @entity23 nomination ( not to mention the president of the @entity129 )			2
her supporters beg to differ			0
conservative audiences in @entity74 , @entity1 and @entity180 have been impressed by her policy - heavy criticisms of @entity82			2
she will have a chance to demonstrate her seriousness on monday			2
hi , my name is @entity186 @entity186 may be among the least - known of the seven people on the stage			2
but thanks to his staunch opposition to abortion and same - sex marriage , the former two - term senator from @entity190 is popular with social conservatives who have played an influential role in choosing the @entity23 nominee			2
@entity186 often touts his social conservative credentials			0
last week , he told @entity2 chief national correspondent @entity199 , who will moderate the debate , " i talk the talk and i walk the walk , and i think that 's what people are looking for , an authentic conviction conservative			0
" though he has spent more time in the key early caucus and primary states than any of his rivals , @entity186 remains in the low single digits in just about every national @entity23 horse race poll			0
the monday debate could give @entity186 an opportunity to increase his name identification by introducing himself to the country			1
@entity186 also has a more robust foreign policy record than any of the declared @entity23 candidates thanks to his time in the @entity219 , something he might try to highlight on monday			0
rising @entity220 @entity220 remains something of a curiosity to most voters , and @entity23 insiders largely discount his viability as a national candidate			0
but the former @entity228 ceo has started to gain traction among social conservatives and @entity232 activists in @entity74 who are expected to have a major voice in the state 's leadoff presidential caucuses			0
@entity220 has also made frequent appearances in @entity1 and he delivered a strong performance last month at a @entity23 debate in @entity180 , albeit one that lacked @entity11 and featured just five candidates			1
debates always give lesser - known candidates a chance to shine			1
with a knack for clever one - liners and confrontational barbs , he just might charm some @entity23 getting their first look at the @entity23 field			0
@entity249 who ? @entity251 , the former governor of @entity252 who resigned to serve as @entity82 's ambassador to @entity254 , plans to make @entity1 a lynchpin of his campaign			0
despite spending loads of time in the @entity1 over the past month , @entity251 decided to take a pass on the debate , saying that he is not yet an official candidate and still putting the finishing touches on his potential campaign			1
but @entity11 and @entity60 both view @entity251 , with his executive resume and deep pockets , as a serious foe			1
it 's worth watching to see if any of the candidates jab at the absentee candidate over his service in the @entity82 administration or his decision to skip the debate .			1

expect front - runner @entity11 to be the target of his rivals
all eyes will be on @entity104 to see if he can get his troubled campaign restarted
*undeclared* candidate @entity150 has opportunity to prove her bona fides
debates give lesser - known candidates a chance to shine , *woo* potential converts
