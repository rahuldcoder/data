in the middle of his first congressional hearing as the new head of the embattled @entity4 , @entity0 was asked monday how he would restore public trust in the agency after revelations that conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status were targeted for extra scrutiny			1
" it is going to be a difficult process , " acknowledged @entity0 , a career public servant appointed by president @entity13 last month to clean up the mess that is dominating news headlines early in his second term			1
@entity0 described a process of identifying what happened , who was responsible and steps to ensure it can never happen again to address what republicans depict as politically motivated harassment that abused constitutional rights of conservative groups			0
' liar ' charge a step too far for some @entity24 democrats , while expressing outrage over the @entity4 targeting , reject @entity24 inferences that it was a broad political conspiracy reaching as high up as the @entity36			1
in addition to the targeting uncovered by a @entity40 inspector general , a second audit coming out this week described improper spending on @entity4 conferences to buttress @entity24 portrayals of big government gone wild under @entity13			2
the @entity4 spent close to $ 50 million on 225 conferences between 2010 and 2012 , according to briefings given to the @entity47 by the inspector - general overseeing the @entity4			2
one of those , an august 2010 meeting for 2,700 employees in @entity52 , @entity53 , cost $ 4 million , and the agency spent $ 50,000 to produce two videos that were shown at the event , including one with a " @entity58 " theme			0
in a response to the new audit , obtained by a congressional source , the @entity4 says it has cut training costs and reduced spending on meetings by 87 % since 2010			1
" the expenditures related to this 2010 meeting are not reflective of the current spending environment at the @entity4 or the spending that has occurred over the past several years , " wrote @entity65 , the agency 's chief financial officer			1
but @entity65 defended the need for large - scale conferences at the time			0
nearly a third of managers in the division under scrutiny were inexperienced , and the agency faced added concerns about security after a @entity81 man crashed his plane into the @entity4 office in @entity84 , killing himself and two other people			2
" although the average cost per employee was reasonable , the @entity4 recognizes that a number of less significant costs warranted additional scrutiny and were not the best use of government resources , " she wrote			2
@entity4 faces new battle on overspending rep. @entity96 , the chairman of the @entity97 who sat in on his panel 's @entity100 's subcommittee on monday , made clear that he would assess the effectiveness and commitment by @entity0 to uncover the source of the wrongdoing when considering @entity4 funding for next fiscal year			2
" the power of the purse rests in the @entity111 , and we 're prepared to use that purse to get to the truth , " the @entity108 @entity24 said			0
two more congressional hearings are scheduled for this week as @entity24 seek to keep up the pressure on @entity13 and @entity117 over the controversies			0
they follow three previous hearings by @entity36 and @entity121 panels , and the matter also is under investigation by the @entity124 , the @entity40 inspector generals office and @entity126 in his new capacity			0
a former @entity129 official , @entity0 took over from former @entity4 commissioner @entity130 , who resigned under pressure after news of the targeting emerged			1
he described himself monday as a fixer of problems in government			0
" the @entity4 is an agency in need right now , " @entity0 said , adding that he took the job " because i thought it could be helpful			2
" that did n't impress some @entity24 on the @entity100 subcommittee , who expressed frustration with the lack of answers to their main question -- who ordered the targeting ? @entity147 : @entity149 @entity4 employees say direction came from @entity151 @entity0 said he also was frustrated and urged patience to allow the various investigations underway to work through the process			1
both @entity0 and @entity155 , the inspector general who conducted the audit that revealed the @entity4 targeting , repeated past assertions that the findings so far indicated gross mismanagement rather than political malfeasance			0
read @entity4 watchdog 's report meanwhile , @entity36 spokesman @entity163 sought to tone down the rhetoric over an increasingly bitter dispute with congressional @entity24 over the issue			1
asked by reporters about an accusation by @entity47 chairman @entity147 that he was a " paid liar , " @entity163 at first jokingly feigned ignorance , answering : " i had n't heard that			1
" as laughter erupted in the briefing room , @entity163 took a more serious tone			0
" i am not going to get into a back - and - forth with " @entity147 , he said , adding that the @entity36 focus was on finding out what " inappropriate activity " occurred , hold responsible those at fault for " inappropriate , outrageous activity " and ensure it never happens again			2
it was a diplomatic effort to avoid prolonging headlines about harsh statements sunday from @entity147 and a former @entity36 official that escalated the controversy into a full - fledged @entity151 political imbroglio , including name - calling and references to decades - old allegations of wrongdoing			2
@entity163 brushes off @entity147 remark appearing on @entity195 's " @entity194 , " @entity147 said sunday that the @entity36 was misleading the public about the full magnitude of the @entity4 targeting , in which some conservative groups seeking tax exempt status were singled out for extra scrutiny			1
in particular , he called @entity163 a " paid liar " and claimed that interviews with @entity4 officials in the @entity149 office that considered requests for tax - exempt status showed that @entity151 officials were involved			1
however , he stopped short of providing proof of his claim , saying only that further investigation would reveal " the whole truth			0
" in response , former @entity36 adviser @entity212 , a @entity117 strategist , denied any political motivation in the @entity4 targeting			1
in a tweet posted later sunday , @entity212 referred to @entity147 's comments as " strong words from mr @entity219 and suspected arsonist / insurance swindler			1
" by the @entity222 : @entity4 the tweet also called @entity147 " loose ethically today , " adding a link to a story about @entity147 's appearance on @entity195			1
@entity212 's tweet referred to allegations from 1972 and 1982 against @entity147 , the former owner of a car alarm company			0
in 1972 , then - 19 - year - old @entity147 was arrested under suspicion of stealing a car , but charges were ultimately dropped			0
@entity147 's brother , on the other hand , is a convicted car thief			1
in 1982 , the office and factory of two companies @entity147 had purchased -- @entity237 and @entity238 -- caught fire			0
the insurance company 's investigation found " suspicious burn patterns " and company officials noted that in the month before the fire , @entity147 had increased his insurance from $ 100,000 to $ 462,000			0
again , no criminal charges were filed			0
@entity4 investigation takes nasty turn			0

the @entity4 is accused of targeting conservatives and wasting money
new commissioner says restoring public trust in the tax agency will be " a difficult process "
@entity36 spokesman @entity163 laughs off , ignores @entity147 's " paid liar " insult
