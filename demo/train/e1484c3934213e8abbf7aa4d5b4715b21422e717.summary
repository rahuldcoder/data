-- one of this week 's most astounding stories is @entity3 's acquisition of @entity4 , a mobile messaging service that has more than 450 million monthly active users globally			1
the $ 19 billion that @entity3 will spend on buying @entity4 created a collective jaw - drop in the tech world			1
sure , the price tag is getting a lot of buzz -- $ 19 billion is a historically big number for a venture funded company			1
but what exactly is @entity3 getting out of it ? a company just a few years old with less than a billion dollars in revenue and a service that is nearly ( but not quite ) free			2
is all of that worth so much money ? just as with the acquisition of @entity23 by @entity24 for $ 1.65 billion or @entity3 's purchase of @entity26 for $ 1 billion , many people simply have a hard time wrapping their mind around an acquisition of a service that does n't fit with traditional valuation principles			1
in the old world , company valuations were based on a multiple of revenue or free cash flow , while also factoring growth over time			0
but in the new world of @entity39 and social media , revenue is often something that will come later as the result of hyper growth , and traditional valuation techniques do n't apply			0
still , because of the eye - popping price , many are naturally asking if this acquisition is a sign of a tech bubble			0
after all , prices for social media and internet service startups seem to be getting bigger by the day and , well , $ 19 billion is a mind - blowing number			1
to which i would say that while the price seems enormous - mainly because it is - the price per user is actually in line with acquisitions in the past decade			0
when looking at price - per - user from acquisitions over the past decade and throwing out outliers like @entity66 's acquisition of @entity67 for nearly $ 11,000 per user ( nice job , @entity69 ) , what @entity3 paid for each @entity4 user is solidly in the middle of the pack at $ 42 , above @entity26 's $ 28 cost per user and @entity78 's $ 33 per user , but below the $ 48 or so @entity24 paid for each @entity23 user back in 2006			2
so while other acquisitions have been much cheaper in total price paid by @entity3 , that 's because the total user base of these other services has been much lower			0
and that 's the thing that makes @entity4 such an attractive prize for @entity3 : 450 million active users			1
not only is that a massive number , but the number is also growing very quickly , having doubled in just the past year			0
in short , with this acquisition , @entity3 is getting the most popular mobile social messaging app in the whole world			2
the importance of this ca n't be understated			0
@entity3 has been trying over the past few years to adapt to the mobile world with mixed results , and now with @entity4 , @entity96 is not only getting a massively popular mobile social messaging service , but one that is also enormously popular in emerging markets			1
as others have aptly noted , because @entity3 does n't control a mobile platform itself ( unlike @entity24 with @entity101 ) , and with its stock rising , @entity96 likely felt it had to make this move now to add fuel to its transition to the world of mobile computing			2
if @entity3 did n't make this move , @entity24 , which reportedly offered $ 10 billlion for @entity4 , likely would have			2
@entity3 is showing that it is willing to bet big chunks of the company ( the @entity4 acquisition will cost them roughly 10 % of outstanding @entity3 shares ) to disrupt themselves and remain relevant			1
a high price to be sure , but judging by recent history , the price it paid is about right			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity119 .			0

@entity3 bought @entity4 , a mobile messaging service , for $ 19 billion
@entity119 : yes , the acquisition is worth the money , even though company is young
he says @entity4 's 450 million active users make it attractive in terms of growth
@entity119 : @entity3 is showing that it is willing to disrupt itself and remain relevant
