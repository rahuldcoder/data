talk of @entity3 exceptionalism has become headline news , with loud sputtering from @entity6 , who suggested that president @entity7 does n't love @entity8 in the same way that the rest of us do			1
@entity6 wants to dwell on our exceptionalism -- the idea that we 're different from other countries , and much better			1
it 's an old idea that @entity7 took on in the second year of his presidency , when he said : " i believe in @entity3 exceptionalism , just as i suspect that the @entity18 believe in @entity20 exceptionalism and the @entity21 believe in @entity21 exceptionalism			1
" that comment annoyed those who wished him to say : " @entity8 is the best country in the world , bar none ! " somehow the drumbeat for exceptionalism continues			1
this month , @entity31 politician @entity30 introduced a bill that tried to ban @entity34 history classes in his state because the guidelines for teachers did n't talk explicitly about @entity3 exceptionalism			1
the bill passed the @entity40 in his state by a 11 - 4 vote but has since been pulled back for a rewrite , the @entity38 reported last week			2
still , it 's part of a battle that has heated up around the country			2
indeed , six states have introduced bills to change the framework of @entity34 history courses to emphasize the idea of exceptionalism and downplay aspects of @entity3 history that do n't seem , well , exceptional			1
scholars have studied the concept thoroughly , and one of the best books on this topic is by @entity59 : " @entity60 : a @entity61 " ( @entity62 , 1996 )			2
@entity59 identifies five features central to the @entity3 value system : liberty , egalitarianism , populism , individualism and laissez - faire			1
he suggests that we look at most trends in @entity3 history through the prism of these concepts , and to an extent this is a useful exercise			1
the @entity3 is truly remarkable , a nation founded on a set of @entity80 ideals so beautifully expressed by the @entity81 and codified in the @entity3 @entity82			1
we should feel good about our ideals , even when we do n't quite manage to live up to them			1
we are a nation of immigrants , a quilt of many colors , and we 've managed over more than two centuries to create a way of life that allows for a reasonable degree of upward mobility , that prizes individual liberty , promotes freedom of religion and genuinely values equal rights for all citizens			1
at certain times in history -- @entity101 is a fine example -- we have joined forces with those on the side of freedom , willingly sacrificing our young men and women in a war that secured the defeat of fascism			2
yet our history is , like every national story , a complicated one , and @entity3 students deserve a balanced view			1
should we really ignore the fact that @entity116 died in massive numbers ( mostly from diseases carried to these shores by the earliest @entity121 invaders ) ? in the 19th century , the @entity122 was " won " at considerable expense to those who actually lived on the land			0
students need to know about the @entity127 , @entity128 and other sad episodes in @entity3 history			1
this is part of our story			0
we need to talk openly about slavery			0
in doing so , it 's useful to look at the @entity135 and see that more than 12 million @entity136 were kidnapped and shipped to the @entity137 between the 16th and 19th centuries			0
the vast bulk of slaves , in fact , went to the @entity142 and @entity8			0
the @entity144 scholar , @entity143 , has written honestly about this			0
of course slavery , wherever it occurred , was a brutal system , and it set in motion a great deal of bad karma , not helped by the sad period after @entity153 ended in 1877 , when an impoverished @entity8 put into effect @entity156 laws that effectively subjugated blacks for many decades , creating a segregated society that -- to a degree -- continues to plague us			2
( i recommend @entity163 's history of this era , " reconstruction : @entity8 's @entity166			2
" ) but the @entity3 has worked hard to recognize and right its wrongs , passing major legislation on civil rights over the years , and we continue to work at this problem			1
it 's a long and winding road , as the @entity173 might have put it			2
as for @entity8 's military adventures , there are lots of wrinkles			0
the @entity178 is an inspiring moment , well worth dwelling on with students			0
but the @entity181 was a disgrace , " one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation , " as president @entity184 said in his memoirs			0
it was this war that ( in part ) caused @entity188 to refuse to pay his taxes			0
@entity101 may have been an @entity3 triumph of will and courage , but the @entity192 is confusing , and students should consider its odd dimensions			1
@entity195 and @entity196 are also complicated , and yet it 's important for students to know that our interventions in both countries led to a great deal of death and destruction			0
at the very least , 133,000 @entity196 civilians died as a result of our " war of choice " in @entity196			0
this number should never be forgotten , as it set in motion a wave of violence that continues to this day , and it helps to explain anti-american feeling in that region			0
the war in @entity215 is ongoing , and it may take decades to know what happened there and why and whether or not it was worth the effort			0
but it surely does n't help anyone to push these questions under the rug			0
@entity7 loves the @entity3 , and he upholds its values proudly			1
he speaks about its history in clear , rational terms , without pumping up the good side or trying to erase the darker sides			2
we should never forget that @entity116 continue to advocate for individual liberty , equality and self - governance			0
we often step in when it 's necessary to help countries in need			0
but our history needs no whitewashing			2
to attempt this does us a terrible disservice			0
@entity3 politicians who dwell on @entity3 exceptionalism only dishonor us by suggesting we play dumb to our past .			1

@entity245 : @entity6 , @entity31 @entity34 history issue have put focus on @entity3 exceptionalism
@entity245 says @entity3 holds high , noble ideals and struggles to improve on *flaws*
to whitewash our history dishonors our values , he says
