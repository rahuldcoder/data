-- @entity2 ' " an @entity1 : the @entity8 , " describes in chilling detail how a young father 's life was turned upside down and forever changed after his wife was murdered and he was wrongly convicted of the crime			0
like nearly all the 311 dna exonerations in the @entity12 , @entity10 's story exposes enormous flaws in the criminal justice system			2
@entity10 almost certainly would have never been convicted if the prosecutor had not failed to turn over critical evidence pointing to his innocence			1
but if there can be a silver lining to a situation in which someone serves nearly 25 years in prison for a crime he did n't commit , @entity10 's case has revealed a valuable tool for holding errant prosecutors accountable for their deliberate misconduct			1
@entity10 was exonerated of the 1986 murder of his wife , @entity30 , after dna testing of a bloody bandana that was found in the woods near the couple 's @entity34 , @entity36 , home was shown to contain the blood of @entity30 and @entity38			1
@entity38 , who has an extensive criminal history , was subsequently convicted of @entity30 's murder			2
based on dna testing conducted during the @entity10 investigation , @entity38 has also been charged with the long unsolved murder of another young wife and mother , @entity46 , who was killed under chillingly similar circumstances two years after @entity49 's murder			1
during the @entity52 's investigation of @entity10 's case , we learned that the prosecutor , @entity53 , who was subsequently made a judge , failed to turn over evidence to @entity10 's attorney			1
that evidence was a detailed account of the murder from @entity10 's 3 - year - old son @entity61			1
@entity61 told his maternal grandmother that @entity10 was not the attacker			2
other evidence that was n't shared also pointed to a third - party assailant			2
last month , in an extremely rare instance of a prosecutor being criminally punished , @entity53 entered a plea " not to contest " proceedings of " criminal contempt of court " related to @entity10 's case , according to @entity34 , @entity36 , court documents			1
@entity53 was sentenced to 10 days in jail , a $ 500 fine , 500 hours of community service and was forced to permanently surrender his license to practice law			0
he had submitted his resignation from the bench a few weeks earlier			0
read more about @entity10 's case and @entity53 's response @entity36 was able to prosecute @entity53 with criminal contempt because there was evidence he had violated a specific court order and made false statements to a judge			1
during the trial , when it became clear that @entity53 was not planning to call the lead investigator in the case , @entity10 's trial lawyers became suspicious and brought it to the judge 's attention			1
the court in turn ordered @entity53 to turn over the investigator 's complete report for it to review			0
at that time the judge also asked @entity53 directly whether he had any evidence that would be favorable to the defense to disclose , and @entity53 said he did not			0
because there was evidence that @entity53 violated a direct order of the court , he was charged through a unique @entity36 procedure called a @entity106 with criminal contempt and concealment of official records for deliberately disobeying the trial judge 's directives			1
because court orders have been shown to be the key to holding prosecutors accountable , courts should routinely order prosecutors to look in their files or a specified police file for all exculpatory material and to disclose it in a timely fashion			1
the prospective standard for determining what is exculpatory should be a version of the @entity126 3.8 ( d ) that by law applies to prosecutors in 49 states and the @entity130			0
it has been adopted by the @entity132 , and requires prosecutors to disclose all evidence that " tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense			0
" most importantly , the order should clearly state that " willful and deliberate failure to comply is punishable by contempt			0
" wording here is significant			0
it means that negligent , inexperienced , stupid or even reckless prosecutors will not be held in contempt , but those few prosecutors who deliberately and willfully suppress exculpatory evidence can be			2
experienced and ethical prosecutors will recognize that the issuance of such orders will be an effective tool for teaching new prosecutors about their obligations and will help expose those " bad apple " prosecutors who discredit the profession			2
these orders create a mechanism for judges to deal with unscrupulous prosecutors in a way that directly addresses the problem			0
in cases where there is a deliberate violation of such an order , judges can punish offenders directly through contempt citations			0
because contempt is generally not subject to statutes of limitations , prosecutors can be punished even if it takes years -- or decades -- to uncover the failure to disclose , which happened in the @entity10 case			1
the orders -- which are known as @entity178 orders -- also make it easier for state bar disciplinary systems to sanction prosecutors			0
prosecutors yield enormous power over life and liberty , and there must be effective systems in place for making them accountable			0
while the number of prosecutors who deliberately break the rules is small , history shows they tend to be repeat offenders			1
if there is to be justice for @entity10 and all the other people who have been wrongly convicted at the hands of unscrupulous prosecutors , every state and federal judge in the nation will start @entity178 orders tomorrow to deter those few prosecutors who would otherwise deliberately violate their ethical and legal duties			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			0

@entity10 spent nearly 25 years in prison for a murder he did n't commit
@entity52 's @entity205 : case reveals valuable tool against bad prosecutors
courts can order prosecutors to turn over key evidence or face contempt charges
prosecutors who break the rules are few , but they often repeat themselves , @entity205 says
