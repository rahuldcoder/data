-- " there is a market for selling humans			2
" that unsettling fact was pushed into the front of the news cycle on monday when a man who claims to have kidnapped 276 teen girls announced in a video message that he would sell the young women into marriage or slavery			1
" i abducted your girls			2
i will sell them in the market , by @entity21 , " the man , who claimed to be @entity15 , the leader of a @entity17 terrorist group @entity16 , said in the video			1
he smiles while he says that , by the way , which sent chills down my spine			2
" there is a market for selling humans , " he adds , according to a @entity0 translation			0
" @entity21 says i should sell			0
he commands me to sell			0
i will sell women ... " this is no doubt an extreme case , and it 's one that has led to international outrage and demands for the @entity37 and other world leaders to help find the young women that reportedly were kidnapped a month ago from school in @entity17			1
everything possible should be done to find these girls , who may be as young as 12			0
but the story is also a harrowing reminder that slavery , in various forms , remains a pervasive reality worldwide , particularly in poor and violent places such as parts of @entity17			1
international efforts to combat the practice have failed to stamp it out			0
perhaps the only sane thing this crazed leader said is that there is a " market for selling humans			0
" it 's 2014 , and that most certainly is true			0
that fact alone is worthy of sustained , global attention			0
in @entity17 , signs suggest the market is alive and well			1
between 670,000 and 740,000 people are estimated to be in slavery in @entity17 , according to the @entity67 's 2013 @entity66			1
that puts @entity17 at no. 4 worldwide in terms of the total number of people enslaved			1
@entity72 , a @entity73 country i visited in 2011 for a @entity0 story , ranks as having the highest percentage of enslaved people , according to that report			1
advocacy groups say 20 million to 30 million people are enslaved worldwide , and more than 15 % of those people are in @entity82 , according to @entity67			1
it 's unclear what exactly would happen to the girls if @entity16 does follow through on its threats to sell them into marriage or slavery			1
young women sold into slavery or marriage sometimes end up as domestic servants ; some are sexually abused by the " husbands " who purchase or obtain them ; some work under threat of violence ; and other women are sold internationally to work in the sex trade			1
" it appears from the media statements that the intention is to sell the girls into so - called ' marriages , ' which are likely to be nothing more than sexual and domestic enslavement , presumably either in neighboring countries or within @entity17 itself , " @entity100 , executive director of global research at the @entity67 , wrote to me in an e-mail from @entity104 , where she is attending a conference			1
@entity17 acts as a sort of hub for human trafficking , with victims sometimes being sent to @entity119 , especially @entity120 , according to experts and published reports			1
during a september 2013 visit to @entity124 , the @entity126 ' special rapporteur on trafficking in persons , @entity129 , told the story of a 21 - year - old woman who was trafficked from @entity17 through @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 and eventually to @entity120			1
the story highlights not only the international nature of the network but also the importance of global vigilance to spot trafficking victims			2
families sleep in the bushes , fearing more attacks " not only was she trafficked but was held in debt bondage as her father back in @entity152 ( of @entity17 ) had put up his land as collateral for the payment of the 60,000 euros ( $ 84,000 ) fee illegal contract to bring her to @entity119 , " @entity129 said of the woman , who was not identified in an online summary and transcript of the speech			1
" the young woman was moved from @entity159 to @entity160 and @entity161 to sell her body in order to repay her debt			0
she was rescued following a random identification check in @entity120 , where she now benefits from assistance			0
" as we keep the young women in @entity17 on our minds and pressure governments to rescue them before they can be sold into marriage or slavery , we also should think about the conditions that foster slavery internationally			1
poverty , instability and a lack of education tend to make the practice of slavery more likely and help it persist			2
this is particularly troubling given reports that the @entity17 girls were kidnapped because they were at school			1
@entity16 , the group taking credit , has a name that roughly translates to " @entity190 education is a sin			0
" education and stability also could help end slavery			2
" any time there 's conflict -- particularly when that 's accompanied by historic discrimination against women and sex violence and abuse -- it 's actually not uncommon that there would be this type of kidnapping , " @entity195 , director of programs at @entity197 , a @entity198 - based advocacy group , told me			2
it 's crucial not to downplay the importance of finding the young women in @entity17 , but i agree with @entity195 when she says that every potential victim of trafficking and sex slavery has an important story to tell			1
@entity216 : what 's at stake in war against girls ' kidnappers ? it 's impossible for each to become the center of global media coverage			0
but each deserves our advocacy			0
if you live in the @entity37 , asking your legislators to pass the @entity230 is one way to show your support for all of the women around the world who are hurt because of their gender			0
the act would make combating gender - based violence a central goal of @entity37 foreign policy			0
@entity242 has an online petition you can sign			0
i 'm sure there are some people who will read this and think that @entity17 and the issues of slavery and the sex trade are far too distant to matter to them			1
for one , that 's patently untrue			0
trafficking occurs in the @entity37 and @entity119 , as well			0
but , if that is your view , i 'd ask you to consider what @entity257 told @entity0 after the kidnapping in @entity17			1
@entity257 , whose father was kidnapped in @entity17 in a separate incident , according to the @entity0 report , said some people in @entity17 reacted to the news by saying " why do i care ? " and " @entity17 is done			1
" they 'd resigned to the control this extremist group exerts			0
and they 'd lost hope that the country can be made safe			0
" i refused to believe that , " he said , according to the report			2
" we ca n't let this be the new normal			1
" i 'd second that			0
this sort of violence against women could start to seem normal if it 's ignored			2
so do n't ignore it			2
demand , as so many are , that the @entity37 and others do more to help rescue the girls			0
and refuse to ignore the fact that , every day , unseen and unheard women face sex slavery and discrimination on an unthinkable magnitude .			2

@entity17 is home to 670,000 to 740,000 slaves , according to 2013 report
@entity292 : @entity17 kidnappings highlight horrific worldwide *problem*
@entity292 talks with slavery experts about what could happen to the kidnapping victims
@entity17 man : " we ca n't let this be the new normal "
