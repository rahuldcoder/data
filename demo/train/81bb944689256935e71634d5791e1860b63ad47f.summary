-- federal prosecutors want baseball legend @entity2 to serve 15 months in prison for his obstruction of justice conviction , according to a sentencing memo filed in court thursday			1
defense lawyers argued in their filing that the judge should accept the probation office 's recommendation that @entity2 be sentenced to two years probation , fined $ 4,000 and ordered to perform 250 hours of community service			1
bonds , 47 , is set to be sentenced on december 16 in a @entity16 federal courtroom , less than two miles from the ballpark where he broke @entity21 's major league home run in august 2007			1
jurors who found @entity2 guilty in april said he was " evasive " in his testimony to the federal grand jury investigating illegal steroids use by pro athletes			1
" because @entity14 's efforts were a corrupt , intentional effort to interfere with that mission , a sentence of 15 months imprisonment is appropriate , " the prosecution said in its memo to @entity30 district judge @entity29			1
but jurors , who were deadlocked on three perjury counts , said that it was not proven that @entity2 lied when he testified that he had not knowingly used steroids			0
prosecutors decided not pursue a retrial			2
prosecutors still argued in the sentencing memo that @entity2 ' denial that he was " taking steroids and human growth hormone were patently false			2
" " whether his purpose was to protect his drug suppliers or his own reputation , @entity2 's pre-testimony efforts to sway the testimony of @entity51 trainer @entity50 established that he approached his grand jury testimony with a plan , " the prosecution said			1
" that plan was to evade telling the truth to the grand jury through any means possible , whether through lies , half - truths , non-sequiturs , or simply bluffing his way through the testimony			2
" " @entity2 's pervasive efforts to testify falsely , to mislead the grand jury , to dodge questions , and to simply refuse to answer questions in the grand jury makes his conduct worthy of a significant jail sentence , " the prosecution argued			1
@entity14 ' testimony in december 2003 was part of the @entity74 investigation that targeted employees of a @entity77 drug testing laboratory and @entity2 ' personal trainer @entity78			1
the testimony that led to his conviction came when a grand jury prosecutor asked @entity2 if @entity78 ever gave him " anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with			2
" @entity2 told the grand jury that only his personal doctors " ever touch me , " and he then veered off the subject to say he never talked baseball with @entity90			1
a juror , who identified herself only as @entity92 and who would not give her last name , told reporters they agreed unanimously that @entity2 was " not directly answering the question , just kind of evading the question			0
" defense lawyers argued that @entity2 ' thought the creams and ointments @entity78 was giving him were made of flaxseed oils			0
in their sentencing memo , the defense urged the judge to accept the probation office 's conclusion that @entity14 's " prior history of good works , " including " charitable and civic contributions " should factor into the sentencing			1
" it is believed that mr. @entity2 can use his status , as well as his past record of giving to youth - related causes for some beneficial and significant impact to society , " the report said			2
also , the conviction " appears to be an aberration when taken in context of his entire life , " the probation office report said			1
the prosecution rejected the probation office conclusions			1
" @entity2 's conduct was not a spontaneous act of aberrant behavior , and his charitable works , while laudable , should not allow him to escape responsibility for his criminal conduct , " prosecutors wrote			1
" the conduct in this case was neither aberrant nor insignificant			0
to the contrary , @entity2 's actions were the product of a calculated plan to obfuscate and distract the grand jury from its role in getting to the truth in the @entity74 inquiry			1
" @entity2 ' legal troubles began in 2003 when he was subpoenaed to testify before the federal grand jury investigating the illegal distribution of performance - enhancing drugs to athletes			0
bonds was told he was not a target of the investigation , which was centered on the @entity74 , known as @entity74			0
his personal trainer , @entity78 , was a target			0
" all he had to do was tell the truth , " assistant u.s. attorney @entity153 said in his closing arguments last week			0
bonds lied to the grand jury because he knew the truth about his steroids use would " tinge his accomplishments " and hurt his baseball career , @entity153 said			2
" his secret was so powerful that he could n't admit it , would n't admit it			0
" the grand jury transcript showed that when he was asked about anabolic steroids before the 2003 baseball season , he said he had not knowingly used them			2
he did acknowledge using substances @entity78 gave him known as " the clear and the cream			0
" @entity153 argued that it was " implausible " that @entity2 would take drugs " and really not know what they were			0
" a urine sample given by @entity2 in the summer of 2003 , just months before his grand jury testimony , tested positive for anabolic steroids , but another sample taken weeks earlier tested negative for the drugs			0
the @entity51 star ended his 21 - year major league career in 2007 with 762 home runs			0
he also set the record for most home runs in a single season in 2001 , when he hit 73 .			0

the probation office report calls for two years probation , a fine and community service
