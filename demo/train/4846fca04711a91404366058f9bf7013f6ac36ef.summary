his is the ultimate rags to riches tale			0
not many people make the leap from teenage market trader to golf professional , fashion entrepreneur and multi-millionaire			2
but that 's just what @entity12 @entity11 has done			1
this is a man who is equally comfortable sashaying his way around a golf course as he is mixing it with the fashionistas			0
on this particular november afternoon , @entity11 is clad in a crisp , white shirt and stonewash jeans			1
slim and athletic , he appears both smart and casual			0
but compared to his usual look on the golf course , @entity11 's sporting a surprisingly reserved look when we meet			1
famed for his fierce will to win and outrageous attire -- he 's big on bold , vibrant checks -- the @entity12 has coupled a successful sporting career with launching his own clothing label -- which is now in its seventh year			1
@entity32 , so named after its founder 's initials , can trace its roots back to the gritty surroundings of @entity37 -- on the outskirts of @entity39			1
long before making his fortune on the golf course , this was where @entity11 first forayed into the rag trade -- and where he learned some important life lessons			1
notably to keep your options open and have a plan @entity49 " i went with a school friend of mine , " @entity11 , a winner of 16 professional titles who has earned over $ 27 million in prize money on the @entity53 alone , tells @entity1			1
" i needed some extra spare cash , so i was talking to my mate who used to pack away and set up stalls			0
he said , ' why do n't you come with me ? ' " that was at the age of 11 , so that 's what i did on a saturday and took it from there really			2
" the competitive drive which has served the 38 - year - old @entity11 so well during his golf career was also perfectly suited to a market stall 's cut and thrust			1
" i was 13 or 14 when ( the owner ) decided to allow me to run the stall while he went on holiday ... i set it up and i carried the cash bag , " said the 38 - year - old , recalling those early days of entrepreneurship			1
" it was quite daunting but back then i was a little money maker			0
" over the years , @entity11 's revenue stream has widened and the bags of cash have grown exponentially			1
he 's won titles on both the prestigious @entity84 and @entity86 tours and is famed for his @entity88 heroics , particularly when he powered @entity86 to an improbable comeback against the @entity90 at @entity91 in 2012			0
but while chipping , driving and putting his way to a succession of titles , @entity11 's interest in sartorial elegance never diminished			1
golf prides itself on the very best dress etiquette , but @entity11 has done his best to shake things up a little			1
during the @entity100 , he took to the course at the @entity102 in @entity103 wearing a pair of @entity106 trousers			0
since then the bleach - blonde boy from @entity37 has graced the fairways draped in an eclectic mix of designs and even a soccer shirt -- he is a huge fan of @entity114 team @entity113			2
" i wear what i want to wear as opposed to wearing what someone else wants me to wear , " he said			0
" i 'm quite a control freak from that standpoint			0
i like what i wear , so it 's good for me to be able to promote that			0
" many might have laughed and dismissed them as misguided outfit choices , but @entity11 's street trading instincts told him he was on to a lucrative business venture			1
" i felt that we would continue the one - off outfits and see where it took us , " he recalls			2
" shortly after that i realised that we had a business opportunity there			0
" @entity11 is happy to delegate the design end of the business to the experts but he takes a keen interest in what they are doing			1
" i do n't personally put pen to paper , i have a design team that do that for me and they do a good job			2
" it 's about them coming up with fresh ideas , making sure the fabrics are moving with the times and making sure the color palettes and everything go with that			0
" despite successfully launching @entity32 and enjoying a lucrative golf career , there remains one notable gap on @entity11 's resume -- a major championship			1
but @entity11 dismisses suggestions he 'll be best remembered for his trousers rather than his trophies , insisting that he is simply well prepared for life after sport			2
" i 've got 14 titles ( two on the @entity165 , 12 on the @entity86 ) to my name and a pretty good @entity88 record , so i think that outweighs the business side of things , " he said			0
" i think in a few years ' time , if i sit back and look at the trophy cabinet and make sure i 've got a successful business , then i 've done my job			2
" i would n't want to be in a position where my golf career has finished and then i 'm trying to start a business			0
so trying to do the whole thing together is probably the right thing			0
" so , three decades on from his first foray into the world of retail , what would the teenage market trader make of @entity32 ? " i think he 'd be pretty happy to be honest , " replies @entity11			1
" the quality is very good			0
i think its premium , so the stall would look nice and smart			2
" he 'd be very happy			0
