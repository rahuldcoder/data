they got out the camping gear and had food and water for a week in case the power went out			0
" the power goes out fairly often here on the @entity2 , so losing power is not really a big deal , " she said			1
track the storm the shoppers were preparing for a potentially devastating one - two tropical cyclone punch , starting with @entity4 , with winds of 75 mph , and @entity4 , a category 3 storm , about 900 miles behind it			1
@entity4 could bring up to 12 inches of rain , life - threatening storm surges , flash floods and mudslides , forecasters said			1
they predicted @entity4 will weaken somewhat and potentially make landfall late thursday as a strong tropical storm			1
@entity4 , churning behind @entity4 , could affect the islands two days later , though forecasters expect it to brush the state only with its southern outer bands as it passes to the north as a weakened tropical storm			1
customers picked through stores for groceries and other supplies wednesday night and thursday morning			2
at many locations , such as @entity79 in @entity80 , bottled water was sold out , leaving the seller scrambling to get more			0
" we 've been on the phone from very early ( wednesday ) morning , working with our vendors trying to get more water			0
it 's been a very difficult situation because everybody is trying to get water , " store manager @entity86 told @entity0 affiliate @entity87			0
flash flooding on already saturated islands will be a main threat , along with mudslides from some of the mountainous terrain into populated areas			2
" preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion , " the @entity99 said in its public advisory on @entity101 early thursday			2
a hurricane warning was in effect for the easternmost populated island , @entity2 , with some of the state 's other islands -- @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 -- bracing for tropical storm conditions , with sustained winds of under 73 mph			1
even as the storms approached @entity2 , the @entity119 said thursday it is more confident that the other side of @entity122 will see a below - average tropical cyclone year			1
@entity119 said that there is now a 70 % chance that the number of named storms in the @entity128 this year will be at or below the 30 - year average of 12			0
@entity119 had put the chance at 50 % on may 22			0
" we are more confident that a below - normal season will occur because atmospheric and oceanic conditions that suppress cyclone formation have developed and will persist through the season , " @entity130 , lead seasonal forecaster with the @entity132 , said			0
storm dangers @entity4 should bring heavy downpours of 4 to 8 inches over the @entity2 ; in isolated spots up to 12 inches , the hurricane center predicts			1
that could cause rock and mudslides			0
and it would further saturate the ground in advance of @entity4 's arrival with more rain			1

since the 1950s , only two hurricane eyes have hit @entity2 -- and both approached from the south , where water temperature generally is warm enough to sustain the storms ' strength			1
@entity4 , however , approaches from the east , and it would be the first tropical cyclone from that direction to hit the state since the satellite era began in 1959 , @entity0 meteorologist @entity180 said			1
that 's not to say @entity2 has n't had close calls			1
the @entity188 sees an average of about five tropical cyclones a year , and some have brushed the state in recent decades			1
but @entity4 is poised to overcome a number of factors that in recent decades conspired to keep the storms from hitting @entity2 directly or weaken them before they got there			1
the cyclones generally approach from the east after forming in the eastern @entity188			2
but close to @entity2 , dry air , cooler water and wind shear combine to weaken approaching cyclones , dissipating them before they can become a significant threat , @entity0 meteorologist @entity200 said			1
now , however , the water off @entity2 is warmer than usual , and that could keep @entity4 at hurricane strength if it hits @entity2 island as expected thursday , @entity200 said			1
@entity2 's most damaging hurricane in recent decades -- @entity212 of 1992 -- came during an @entity213 year , or a year of above - average sea surface temperatures			1
this year has n't met the criteria for @entity213 , but it could in the weeks ahead , @entity200 said			0
