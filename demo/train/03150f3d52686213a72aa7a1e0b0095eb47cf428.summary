@entity0 -- protesters will resist any efforts to remove them from the @entity6 park where they have been camped for nearly a month , despite mayor @entity8 's order that they vacate the park at 7 a.m. friday so it can be cleaned , an organizer said thursday			1
" come tomorrow morning , we will passively resist and make it as difficult a process to remove us as possible , " said @entity11 spokesman @entity10			1
" it 's not an occupation if you ca n't occupy the park			1
" his words appeared to be backed up by the sentiment of the crowd of more than 1,000 protesters who filled @entity21 thursday night			1
" all day ! all week ! occupy @entity11 ! " they chanted			2
@entity10 called the mayor 's announcement a " not - so - veiled attempt " to force protesters from the park , setting up a possible confrontation with authorities			1

@entity39 of @entity40 said he was planning to deliver to @entity41 more than 350,000 petitions and signatures he received thursday from supporters around the nation			0
" the mayor would do a lot better cleaning up @entity11 than cleaning up the plaza , " he said			2
" the park is clean , " said @entity49 , a councilwoman from @entity50			2

" @entity8 met wednesday with protesters and told them that the decision to clean the park was made after owners voiced concerns about " unsanitary conditions and considerable wear and tear on the park			1
" " the mayor is a strong believer in the @entity93 and believes that the protesters have a right to continue to protest , " deputy mayor for @entity89 said in a written statement			0
but the situation in the park is " not in the best interests of the protesters , residents or the city , " he said			1
the cleaning is to be done in stages , and protesters will be allowed to return to the park as areas are cleaned if they obey the rules set forth by the owners , @entity109 , the statement said			1
