-- the brief but bloody @entity2 conflict between @entity3 and @entity4 marks a clear wake - up call to both sides , and their supporters , on the indispensable need to start serious talks beyond the new cease - fire			1
this development must be seized upon to convert the recent crisis into an opportunity after years of inaction			0
a desperate injection of diplomatic energy is required			0
the alternative is renouncing responsibility and initiative to continuous unpredictability , and becoming its hostage			0
in an increasingly volatile region experiencing historic transformation and shifting alliances , the potential for simultaneous conflict on multiple fronts remains real			2
are you affected by the conflict ? share photos and video , but stay safe			2
diminishing the threat , and its catastrophic consequences , through a credible process is critical to regional stability and international order			2
the cease - fire alone simply marks the end of another chapter in the decades - old vicious cycle of violence between @entity3 and @entity42			1
ideally , a next phase of negotiations should focus on a permanent end of hostilities			0
although its duration would be unknown , it is best to commence sooner rather than later			0
the regional status quo is simply unsustainable in the long - term			1
time is of the essence			0
a continuing game of brinksmanship risks miscalculation and another descent into the abyss at any given moment			0
after all , there is no military solution to the @entity3 - @entity42 conundrum			1
tallying the results of the recent conflict leaves adequate room for each side to claim points and some form of victory			2
however , neither could benefit from further escalation			0
for @entity3 , its @entity73 anti-missile defense system proved increasingly effective			1
its surgical strikes in @entity2 demonstrated greater accuracy			1
although no match for @entity3 's superior firepower , @entity4 's rockets reached alarmingly deeper into @entity3 territory			1
this provided a psychological boost to morale despite relentless @entity3 attacks and considerable physical damage			2
post-conflict reconstruction is nothing new : @entity4 will emerge politically strengthened at home and abroad and it will continue to overshadow @entity89 , which controls the @entity90			2
the credibility of @entity42 president @entity92 is further undermined , even as he actively pursues non-member observer status for @entity42 at the @entity94			2
the presence of intermediaries in @entity97 to negotiate the cease - fire reaffirms the centrality of @entity101 's role to any peace process			1
clearly , without @entity101 , no solutions are possible			2
for now , the cease - fire also marks the most important foreign policy test and achievement yet for new @entity101 president @entity107			1
since @entity109 's ouster and its departure from @entity111 , @entity4 remains increasingly dependent upon @entity101 ideologically , politically , diplomatically and economically			1
throughout the week - long conflict , @entity107 skilfully influenced @entity4			1
furthermore , sending @entity101 's prime minister to @entity2 at the very start of the crisis proved symbolically important , although practically ineffective			1
through the cease - fire , @entity107 has raised his standing at home and abroad			1
a process of establishing himself as a reliable regional broker has begun			2
however , responsible continuity and critical follow up is required			0
statements alone will not suffice			0
in concrete terms , he must prove able to restrain @entity4 when necessary and guide it on a constructive path toward peace			1
sustained diplomatic support from the @entity130 and @entity131 , and particularly financial assistance from @entity133 , will further strengthen @entity107 's hand			1
the increased leverage from positive crisis management must be used effectively by @entity107 at home			2
while he is developing a pragmatic accommodation with the military , serious concerns still linger for political opponents and minorities of his broader agenda			0
@entity107 must reach out beyond his political base and take a more inclusive approach			2
the crisis also underscored the need to strike a balance between public expectations , particularly in @entity151 ranks , and what is realistically achievable in the diplomatic realm			0
while in opposition during the @entity109 era , @entity154 scored easy points with public opinion when condemning government inaction during @entity3 - @entity42 violence			1
now the reality of power demands greater rhetorical responsibility and restraint from islamists in government			0
the current cease - fire also offers president @entity107 the opportunity for renewed , and closer , engagement with the @entity171 , particularly after president @entity173 's election victory and @entity107 's initial blunders following the killing of @entity171 's ambassador to @entity177			1
with the @entity171 election over , the burden is also on president @entity173 to assume a more proactive role in fostering a productive peace process , in collaboration with allies and regional powers			2
@entity173 's first attempt immediately following his 2009 inauguration ended in humiliation at the hands of @entity3 prime minister @entity190			1
although once bitten , @entity173 can not be twice shy			0
@entity171 national interests and international order can not afford it			0
with a drastically transforming @entity194 and in search for a foreign policy legacy , @entity173 must seize the historic opportunity for a new start			0
there is no room for reluctance or excessive caution			0
troubles with @entity204 and @entity111 can not be obstacles to a @entity42 state			0
furthermore , the growing perception of exclusive @entity171 interest in east @entity209 and neglect and indifference to the @entity194 is very destabilizing			0
it creates an increasingly dangerous power vacuum and encourages nefarious forces to fill it			0
@entity173 's penchant for re-start buttons should not lose focus on the @entity194 , and particularly @entity101			1
approximately two months away from election , the cease - fire was the best possible outcome for @entity3 's @entity190			1
he emerges politically stronger and brandishes his leadership credentials as the guarantor of @entity3 's security			1
averting a ground invasion was crucial			0
he exits the crisis with ample support in the @entity90 and avoided greater international isolation			0
however , the regional game has dramatically changed for all players			0
@entity190 no longer enjoys @entity109 's passive acquiescence in @entity101 or a reliably predictable enemy like president @entity233 in @entity111			1
new realities require new approaches			0
failure to adapt will have considerable consequences for @entity190 and @entity3			1
ultimately , a resolution to the @entity3 - @entity42 issue is not a panacea to the ills plaguing the broader @entity194			1
however , it would provide indispensable momentum and unleash new dynamics in confronting other outstanding grievances around the region and beyond			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			2
