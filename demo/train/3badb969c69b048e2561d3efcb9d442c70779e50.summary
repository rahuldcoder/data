-- @entity1 leading @entity2 to a late victory over @entity4 grabbed headlines on the eighth day of @entity7 group play , but before that match began another team had an arguably more important victory			1
@entity12 's 2 - 1 defeat of @entity13 means that the @entity14 will definitely go through to the knockout stage of the competition , regardless of the results of their final group match next week , against @entity20			2
@entity12 becomes the third team guaranteed to go through			0
through : @entity22 @entity23 @entity12 there are also three teams that definitely can not qualify for the knockout stage			2
defending champs @entity27 are the highest - profile early casualty , but they 're not alone			0
out : @entity27 @entity32 @entity33 beyond that , things get more complicated			0
friday sees four teams trying to book a place in the knockout stage , as @entity41 face @entity39 and @entity42 play @entity43			1
all four teams won their first match			0
remember , a team gets three points for a win and one for a draw			0
if two teams have the same number of points , the one with the greater goal difference is ahead , so -- for example -- @entity39 's 3 - 1 victory over @entity2 puts them at the top of @entity58 , while @entity41 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity4 is good enough for second			1
in theory , any of those four teams can still go through at this point , which is why @entity41 's @entity64 said he wants a kiss ( on the cheek ) from the @entity67 if his side beats @entity39 -- that would keep @entity4 's chances alive , if slim			1
it may not be a surprise that @entity58 is turning into the most complex battle so far			0
its teams are , as a whole , the highest ranking in the @entity7 , with @entity2 ranked seventh in the world , @entity41 ninth , @entity4 10th and @entity39 28th			1
the @entity42 - @entity43 match for the top of @entity82 is more likely to produce a group leader			1
each team won their first match and has three points , so a draw will mean each has four and a victory for either side will give them six			0
the other two teams in the group , @entity93 and @entity94 , both lost their first matches and have no points , so they both have to fight for a big win to have much hope of going through			0
if they draw , they get one point each and would only go through if either @entity42 or @entity43 win tonight , and the winner of the @entity93 - @entity94 match also wins big in their last match of the group			1
got that ? @entity7 schedule of matches @entity0 's @entity107 contributed to this report .			2

three teams are now certain to go through to the next stage of the @entity7
three others can not get past the group stage
@entity41 and @entity39 are battling for a place in the final *16* , but it 's complicated
@entity43 and @entity42 face off for bragging *rights* in their group
