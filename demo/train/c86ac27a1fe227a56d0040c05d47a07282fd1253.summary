opening in 1863 , @entity0 has the world 's oldest underground railway but it also has , in austerely beautiful @entity3 , one of @entity6 's most futuristic - looking stations			1
the first metro might have been uncomfortable and unhealthy ( toxic steam often entered the train cars due to poor ventilation ) but it soon became clear that few cities of any size should be without one			1
by the mid- 1920s , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 had their own subterranean networks -- with cleaner , electric - powered trains and often also beating @entity19 in the aesthetic appeal of their stations			0
@entity23 joined the party in 1935 and now boasts one of the busiest metro systems in the world -- carrying more than 6.5 million passengers a day			2
but as the following stations show , more than 150 years after the @entity30 opened , there 's a lot more to a great subway stop than getting from a to @entity34 1			2
@entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 opened in 2012 , @entity35 station defies its depth -- at 50 meters , one of the deepest in @entity36 -- with a design based around themes of light and water			1
a work called " @entity47 " by @entity46 illuminates the station corridor furthest underground			2
this stunning station has competition : it 's part of the city 's network of so - called @entity55			1
@entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 inaugurated in 1998 to little fanfare , this otherwise ordinary looking station took on new life just three years later			2
in 2001 , @entity56 's platform was aesthetically enhanced by 11 enormous , domed lighting fixtures that continuously bathe the surroundings in haunting shades of blue , yellow and red			2
@entity67 ( @entity68 ) , @entity23 @entity67 station 's baroque - style decor , historical mosaics and chandeliered ceilings resemble a grand ballroom			1
opened in 1952 to alleviate the congestion of one of @entity23 's busiest transport hubs , it was @entity79 's infamous 1941 wartime speech that inspired the opulence of the mosaics			0
@entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 in 1998 , @entity83 hosted a world expo , in part to celebrate 500 years of @entity84 inventions			0
built to help transport the expo 's 11 million visitors , the station is a whimsically colorful space that to this day holds its own as a modern work of art. 5			1
@entity3 , @entity0 @entity30 might be the great - great - grandparent of all the world 's metro stations but @entity3 , opened just days before the new millennium , has to be one of the most futuristic - looking			1
the austere concrete and stainless steel design somehow achieves a functional beauty rather than oppressing all those commuters scurrying to and from their offices			0
@entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 above ground , @entity105 's central station looks like a pretty average part of a rapid transit system			1
start boring down , though , and unexpected changes in color and shape reveal a very different animal			0
when commuters reach the bold blue and white , cave - like platform at @entity104 , they 're reminded that they 've indeed ventured underground			0
@entity118 , @entity119 , @entity58 seeking to distinguish his design from the unobtrusive minimalism of other @entity119 stations , architect @entity120 outdid himself with the fantastical entrance to @entity118			1
depicting a train car crashing through the sidewalk , it leaves commuters either shocked or bemused , but rarely indifferent			1
" @entity129 , " @entity130 , @entity131 less than 20 years old , @entity130 's metro is the third - largest in @entity131			1
the curved - glass entrances of many of the stations -- affectionately nicknamed " @entity129 " ( " @entity137 " ) after their creator , @entity133 -- are considered prime examples of the city 's modern , up - to - the - minute style			0
the transparent structures admit plenty of daytime light and at night are lit up			0
@entity145 -- @entity146 , @entity13 in a city as beautiful as @entity13 , this unconventional station entrance at @entity148 still stands out			0
completed in 2000 ( the centennial year of the @entity13 metro ) , @entity152 's " @entity151 " ( " @entity153 " ) intertwines dazzling colored beads to form two protective cupolas			1
a meeker design would be overshadowed by the close proximity of the @entity146 and surrounding classic architecture			0
in this case , however , it adds a touch of cheeky hipness			0
@entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 @entity164 's newest metro stop proves that classic and modern design can coexist harmoniously			2
after many setbacks , the station finally opened for business in december 2011			0
stark curved ceilings and low lighting complement traditional marble and arched platforms in what 's the deepest station in the network			2
@entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 the @entity181 built some extraordinary metro stations but this 2005 effort , named after @entity185 president @entity184 , showed that a capitalist @entity180 could come up with some beauties , too			0
unless , as might appear , it was actually built by @entity188			0
@entity189 , @entity190 all the stations on @entity190 's @entity192 deserve a place in the @entity6 metro hall of fame for their distinctive dimpled metal tunnel walls , but @entity196 is the most visited and photographed			1
a different color for each station , they look like something from the dystopian film " @entity201 , " but the bubble - wrap design actually strengthens the metal			0
what 's the best metro stop -- in @entity6 or worldwide -- you 've ever traveled through ? elbow your way into the carriage in the comments field below .			1

" metro envy " has produced some stunners in @entity6
at 50 meters deep , @entity35 station , in @entity36 , feels filled with light
part of the oldest metro , @entity0 's @entity3 looks *super-futuristic*
