-- @entity1 is poised to produce more cars than @entity3 in 2013 for the first time , hitting a landmark in the country 's rise in the automobile industry and underlining the difficulties for the @entity3 vehicle sector as it faces a challenging 12 months			1
@entity1 is in 2013 set to make 19.6m cars and other light vehicles such as small trucks compared with 18.3m in @entity3 , according to projections prepared for the @entity0 by five forecasting groups			1
the rise of @entity1 is even more striking considering the projections for @entity3 include not just the @entity20 but other nations such as @entity22 and @entity23			1
in 2012 , on the basis of motor industry estimates , @entity3 made 18.9m cars and related vehicles , comfortably ahead of @entity1 's tally of 17.8m			1
the projections are based on data from the @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity34 consultancies together with investment banks @entity37 and @entity36			0
they paint a picture of only a slight recovery in 2013 for the world car industry , where output is expected to climb by a muted 2.2 per cent in the coming year , as against 4.9 per cent in 2012			0
with global sales valued at about $ 1.3tn a year , the car industry is one of the best bellwethers of world economic conditions			0
according to the data , @entity3 will in 2013 make just over a fifth of the world 's cars -- a figure that is well down on the 35 per cent it recorded in 2001			1
in 1970 nearly one in every two cars made in the world originated from a factory in @entity3 -- which is generally recognised as the place where the global auto industry began with the unveiling of a rudimentary three - wheeler in 1885 by the @entity61 inventor @entity60			2
car production in @entity1 in 2013 is likely to be 10 times higher than in 2000 -- when its share of global auto manufacturing was just 3.5 per cent as opposed to a likely 23.8 per cent in 2013			0
@entity65 , an automotive expert at the @entity67 consultancy , said that even with relatively strong growth projected in vehicle output and demand in both the @entity73 and @entity1 , " these markets alone wo n't do much to pull [ the whole world ] forward "			0
mr @entity65 also cautioned that even with a continuation of the recent rise of the car industry in @entity1 , many vehicle markers doing business there " are struggling to make much money " as a result of tough competition and the fact that the market is made up of large numbers of small cars , for which profit margins for manufacturers are small			1
@entity3 's expected fall in production is in response to a steep decline in car sales throughout the continent since the 2008/09 financial crisis , with the problems causing severe difficulties at a number of large vehicle makers , notably @entity102 's @entity101 « n , which is cutting almost 10,000 jobs and is lining up a â ‚ ¬ 7bn rescue package for its financing arm with the @entity102 government			2
most car markers with strong positions in the @entity3 vehicle business are braced for a turbulent period ahead			2
@entity111 , chief executive of the @entity61 luxury carmaker @entity112 , said he expected conditions for selling cars in @entity3 would remain " very challenging " in 2013			0
@entity116 ¥ kan @entity115 , chief executive of @entity117 of @entity118 , said : " [ as for ] the [ @entity3 car ] market , you can only pray			0
