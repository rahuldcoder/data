@entity0 -- a controversial @entity3 page calling for another @entity5 intifada has been pulled off the social media website , following complaints from the @entity9 government that it incited violence against @entity11			1
a statement from @entity3 said the group page entitled the " @entity17 " -- which had garnered more than 350,000 " likes " over the course of the past month -- was removed from the website because it contained direct calls for violence			1
" the page ... began as a call for peaceful protest , even though it used a term that has been associated with violence in the past			2
in addition , the administrators initially removed comments that promoted violence , " the company statement said			1
" however , after the publicity of the page , more comments deteriorated to direct calls for violence			2
eventually , the administrators also participated in these calls			0
after administrators of the page received repeated warnings about posts that violated our policies , we removed the page			0
" we continue to believe that people on @entity3 should be able to express their opinions , and we do n't typically take down content that speaks out against countries , religions , political entities , or ideas			0
however , we monitor pages that are reported to us and when they degrade to direct calls for violence or expressions of hate -- as occurred in this case -- we have and will continue to take them down , " @entity3 said			1
a few other identically named pages have popped up since then , some with the same messages the previous page had			0
the page 's removal follows heavy criticism from the @entity9 government and @entity67 organizations that @entity3 was ignoring its own terms - of - service guidelines , which prohibit the posting of content that is " hateful , threatening , or ... incites violence			1
" @entity72 , @entity9 's minister of public diplomacy and diaspora affairs , said tuesday in a statement that the removal of the page showed that " @entity3 management understood that the page is a blunt abuse of freedom of speech to incite to violent actions			1
" the @entity82 also praised the move			0
" by taking this action , @entity3 has now recognized an important standard to be applied when evaluating issues of non-compliance with its terms of service involving distinctions between incitement to violence and legitimate calls for collective expressions of opinion and action , " said a statement tuesday from @entity85 , national director of the group			2
" as it continues to monitor its pages , @entity3 should be able to apply this standard in response to complaints about other pages with similar content			2
we hope that they will continue to vigilantly monitor their pages for other groups that call for violence or terrorism against @entity11 and @entity9			1
" @entity72 sent a letter to @entity3 founder and chairman @entity112 last week , complaining of content on the page that promoted " the killing of @entity9 and @entity11 and the ' liberating ' of @entity0 and of @entity116 through acts of violence			1
" " you are obviously aware of the site 's great potential to rally the masses around good causes , and we are all thankful for that			0
however , such potential comes hand in hand with the ability to cause great harm such as in the case of the wild incitement , " @entity72 's letter said			0
@entity72 's office had said monday it was satisfied with moves the social media giant had made in monitoring the site and removing objectionable content			0
the @entity3 page in question was set up in early march by a group of unidentified activists who called for a third intifada to start on may 15 , a date known by @entity5 as the @entity145 -- or catastrophe -- which commemorates the displacement of hundred of thousands of @entity5 from their homes in warfare that led to the establishment of @entity9 in 1948			1
the word intifada -- which is literally translated as " shaking off " -- is popularly used to describe a revolt or rebellion			0
@entity5 have staged two intifadas , which began in 1987 and 2000 respectively			0
violence surrounding the second intifada claimed the lives of thousands of @entity9 and @entity5			2
in an administrative post , the activists wrote that the purpose of the page was to liberate @entity116 and fight " against injustice , division , and corruption " following the protest movements in @entity165 , @entity166 , and @entity167			2
in a march 24 post , the administrators said their approach was peaceful and that they were committed to maintaining freedom of expression			0
they also suggested it was not fair to single out their page when thousands of pages on the social media website contained similar content , and threatened a mass @entity183 boycott of @entity3 if the page was pulled down .			1
