@entity0 -- when the government investigates the alleged unauthorized release of sensitive information , the focus is normally on the person doing the leaking			2
but the criminal case against a @entity10 contractor escalated dramatically , putting the spotlight on the person reportedly receiving those communications -- @entity14 reporter @entity13			1
the complex layer of once - secret search warrants for e-mails and phone records involving @entity13 have raised constitutional concerns about press freedoms , balanced against national security			1
the investigation of that adviser , @entity24 , and a separate probe involving clandestine searches of @entity28 records , has prompted president @entity29 to order a review of the federal government 's practices involving leaks of classified material			1
" i am troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable , " @entity29 said recently			1
he has directed attorney general @entity39 to review the government 's guidelines on such matters			1
@entity39 will convene a panel of media organizations scheduled to begin on thursday as part of his review			1
the details of the investigation a look at the legal records in the @entity24 case reveals much about the evolving process of the investigation			1
here is what is known about the ongoing case : in november 2009 , the @entity57 secretly asked a federal court to grant a search warrant for a personal email account through @entity62 servers			1
prosecutors suspected @entity24 , who joined the @entity10 in 2008 , was giving information to @entity13 , classified intelligence about @entity66			1
along with private e-mails and phone records , @entity57 officials tracked the reporter 's movements in the @entity10 using his @entity73 badge			1
@entity24 , 45 , was born in @entity75 @entity74 and moved to the @entity76 when he was a boy			0
his family settled in the @entity79 section of @entity80			0
he has a phd from @entity82 in diplomatic and military history			0
one of his areas of specialty at the @entity10 was @entity66 's nuclear program			2
recently unsealed documents show the government had in 2009 amassed an impressive amount of evidence against @entity24 , a contractor who no longer works at the @entity10			1
@entity39 runs into roadblocks on off - the - record meetings on leaks at the time , an @entity97 agent making the search warrant request , said , " i conclude from the foregoing that mr. @entity24 and reporter a have communicated as recently as august 15 , 2009 by email through both the [ redacted ] @ yahoo.com accounts as well as what appears to be a clandestine e-mail account set up by @entity105 , [ redacted ] @ gmail.com , to communicate with mr. @entity24 and perhaps other sources of information			1
" and what of reporter @entity13 ? as of late 2009 , the government apparently had no interest going after him			1
" the @entity97 is not at this time seeking a search warrant for [ redacted ] @ gmail.com			2
rather it is restricting its request for email search warrants associated with mr. @entity24			1
" the @entity119 account is apparently @entity13 's although he is not mentioned by name in any of the documents			2
six months later , things take a dramatic turn			0
another search warrant application is filed in @entity0 , this time for a personal @entity119 account controlled by @entity126 it is clear from the records it is @entity13 's account and that he was at that time , in the government 's eyes , possibly involved in a crime as " aider or abettor and / or co-conspirator			2
" the warrant application was filed without the prior knowledge of @entity14			2
the government acknowledged it was an unusual situation , but felt it had no choice			0
" the @entity97 has exhausted all reasonable non-media alternatives for collecting the evidence it seeks , " said the may 2010 affidavit about @entity13 's communications			0
" because of the reporter 's own potential criminal liability in this matter , we believe requesting the voluntary production of materials from reporter would be futile and would pose substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation and of the evidence we seek to obtain by the warrant			2
" @entity39 to meet with news execs an attempt to seal the records the @entity29 administration had fought for more than two years to keep the @entity24 and @entity13 search warrant affidavits sealed			1
in an unusual twist federal judge @entity162 last november ordered the records publicly released , but court clerks had for some reason failed to enter the documents in the court 's online docket until last week			0
the publicly available court records do not clearly indicate why the government felt it needed to expand its already strong evidence against @entity24 into a probe of @entity13 's actions			0
the reporter has not been charged with any crime , and while he was listed as a " co-conspirator , " that often does not mean he would be considered a target			2
@entity14 officials have subsequently offered differing versions about when and if they were notified by the @entity57 after the fact about the searches			1
a law enforcement official insisted tuesday the government notified @entity14 's parent company @entity185 it was issuing a request for two days of phone records in 2009			1
@entity57 policy requires those types of notifications to be delivered via certified mail , fax , and e-mail			2
the official said on august 27 , 2010 , two separate notifications were sent to @entity197 , then the general counsel for @entity199 e-mail also was sent to @entity13 on the same day notifying him of the subpoena , the official said			0
the official request , according to this official , was for toll records -- lists of what numbers were dialed from five phone lines associated with @entity13 -- and also the phone numbers of the calls received			0
the records would not reveal any content from conversations			0
but @entity197 , speaking to @entity1 tuesday , said he does n't remember receiving any notification from the @entity57 about a subpoena			2
" i have no recollection of receiving anything from the @entity57 , " @entity197 said			2
" it 's the kind of thing i would remember			0
" search warrants and subpoenas can be different			1
subpoenas in this legal context are orders to a particular party to produce certain records or information			0
search warrants are court orders allowing law enforcement to gather information or collect evidence , often without the prior knowledge of the person being investigated			1
attorney general sign - off @entity57 policy requires the attorney general to personally sign off on any search warrants involving the media			1
a justice official tells @entity238 in fact did just that			0
the actual warrant was approved by a federal magistrate			0
many legal scholars say the only justification for such a search warrant involving the press -- and the high - level approval necessary from @entity39 -- would be if prosecutors firmly believe that reporter is criminally involved in an illegal leak of information , and are prepared to take legal action			1
the government suggested as much when it requested @entity13 's private phone and e-mail records			0
but in the three years since , no indictment has come against @entity13			0
administration officials have yet to explain -- either in court records or in a press conference -- whether @entity13 was a serious target of prosecution , or whether @entity24 was the only person they were planning to prosecute and needed to make the claim about the @entity14 reporter in order to get emails to help the @entity24 prosecution			1
the affidavit involving the @entity13 records says one of the main reasons for the search warrant was @entity24 had allegedly erased some e-mails that investigators were not able to recover			0
the @entity97 believed those missing e-mails could be found in @entity13 's accounts			0
for example , the government was curious about how @entity24 ( reportedly using the alias " @entity278 " ) responded to @entity13 's alleged may 22 , 2009 , e-mail : " @entity278			2
what i am interested in , as you might expect , is breaking news ahead of my competitors			0
" @entity57 says e-mails , letter prove it notified @entity14 of subpoenas @entity39 under fire @entity39 faces questions from @entity289 on @entity290 , who are looking into whether he lied under oath earlier this month when he said he was not involved in the " potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material			1
" " that is not something i 've ever been involved in , heard of , would think would be wise policy , " @entity39 said at the may 15 hearing			2
@entity302 spokesman @entity301 said wednesday that no prosecution ever took place in the @entity14 case , and therefore it was " self - evident " that any charge @entity39 lied to the @entity302 panel was " inaccurate			1
" the attorney general said tuesday he is " not satisfied " with some of the guidelines on how prosecutors conduct leak investigations involving reporters			1
" we 're going to have a real frank , good conversation about this , " @entity39 told reporters following a naturalization ceremony for new @entity76 citizens			2
" and i think , we 're going to make some changes because i 'm not satisfied with where we are			0
" focus on @entity10 contractor while much of the political debate centers around @entity13 and search warrants for members of the press -- from a legal perspective , the criminal case is clearly focused on @entity24			1
in the search warrant affidavit for @entity13 , it is @entity24 's alleged acts that drive the legal narrative			0
the government alleges call records of @entity24 's desk phone at the @entity10 between may and july of 2009 show 36 calls were exchanged between the government contractor and the reporter , including seven on the date @entity13 published a story about @entity66			1
@entity24 himself was interviewed by @entity97 agents three months later in september of 2009 where he denied leaking classified information			0
he allegedly told investigators , according to the redacted affidavit , " i would n't pick up a phone and call [ the reporter ] or [ the news organization that the reporter works for ]			0
" eleven months after that interview -- and three months after the @entity13 search warrant was issued -- @entity24 was indicted for unauthorized disclosure of " @entity354 " and for making false statements to investigators			0
his case has not gone to trial and he denies the charges			0
the case is @entity76 v. @entity24 ( 10 - cr - 225 )			0
@entity1 's @entity362 and @entity363 contributed to this report .			0

@entity57 sought search warrants for *electronic* communication of @entity14 reporter in *connection* with leak investigation
@entity372 focused on @entity10 contractor who may have been in contact with reporter
the reporter has never been charged and as of late 2009 , the government apparently had no interest going after him
attorney general @entity39 has come under fire for @entity57 handling of the case
