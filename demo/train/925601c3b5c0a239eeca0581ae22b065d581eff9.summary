@entity0 -- " no queremos ir pa ' @entity2 ! " we do n't want to go to @entity2			1
those words were repeatedly sung by a young man in his mid- 20s , who had just risked his life to escape the communist island			0
instead , he found himself , along with nine other @entity2 men , lying on the deck of the @entity11			1
the eyes of all 10 filled with desperation and sadness			0
they knew they were going back			0
on this night , the @entity11 received the men from another cutter , less than 10 miles off @entity19 , @entity20			1
in the distance , they could see the lights of the land of freedom they hoped to reach			2
but , like many before them , they would be quickly processed and repatriated			0
this is a different front line of the immigration crisis : the @entity31 , a 90 - mile - long stretch of open water between the @entity34 and @entity2			1
on one side , the @entity35			0
on the other , the @entity38			0
and , in between , an alarming increase in the number of people -- mostly @entity2 and @entity42 -- using makeshift rafts and boats in an attempt to reach @entity46			1
in fiscal year 2014 , which ended september 30 , the @entity11 @entity47 , which patrols this area , saw the highest number of migrants in five years , with 10,126 people found on land and sea			1
that 's over 3,000 more than the previous year			1
" most of it is economic			0
they 're looking for a better way of life , " said lt. @entity59 , commanding officer of the @entity11			1
more attempts , new routes for some of those caught and returned , it 's just the latest chapter in their long journey to freedom			1
@entity1 learned one of the @entity2 men on the @entity11 was on his ninth attempt at crossing the @entity31			1
" there are people that have done this dozens of times , " said @entity59			0
and , since 2012 , the @entity11 says it has seen human smugglers use new routes to get migrants to @entity46 -- namely , by avoiding @entity20 altogether			1
in @entity2 's case , people on the island now have more freedom to visit other countries			1
so , an increasing number of @entity2 are legally flying to smaller @entity88 islands near the @entity89 , then smugglers are bringing them over to the tiny @entity46 territory			1
" that 's a very short maritime distance			2
and so , it 's tough to combat that , " said capt. @entity92 , the chief of response for the @entity94 @entity47			2
for @entity42 , the new routes are longer and more dangerous			0
" there are organized smugglers that will try to lure them from @entity42 through the @entity100 , and then into @entity101			0
that never happened really , before 2012			0
and now , that vector accounts for 40 % of all the @entity42 leaving @entity42 , " said @entity92			0
doing more with less when it comes to dealing with migrants , the @entity11 is in a unique position			1
part of the agency 's mission is humanitarian			2
but , unlike the other military branches , the @entity11 , which now resides within the @entity110 , also has federal law enforcement responsibilities			1
in that capacity , it also serves as the lead agency in charge of stopping human and drug smugglers in open waters			2
and , along the @entity31 , it 's not an easy task			1
" there are organized smugglers here , especially human traffickers -- the lowest of the low , when it comes to trafficking			0
it could be kids , women caught up in the sex trade			0
they 're moving people any way they can to try to get them in the @entity46 , " @entity92 said			1
he said it can get frustrating to deal with these multiple missions , with such limited resources			0
in a recent summary released online , the @entity11 's budget is expected to be about $ 6.7 billion for the 2015 fiscal year -- a fraction of what other military branches receive			1
" we try to do the best we can to be creative , to be nimble and to try to be one step ahead of these smugglers			0
but it 's a challenge , because they 're thinking the same way			2
they 're running a for - profit , multimillion - dollar business , so they have a lot of incentive to get their product to market , whether it 's drugs or people			1
" ' this is what we do ' @entity158 , 33 , is on the crew of the @entity11			1
the 13 - year @entity94 veteran is also the son of @entity2 immigrants , who came to the @entity46 in 1979			1
" they did everything they could to come and have children in the @entity46 , and provide better opportunities for us			2
i 'm able to live the @entity46 dream			2
" @entity158 is one of two @entity169 on the cutter			0
they both admit , at times , it 's hard to separate their jobs from their personal connections to the plight of the migrants they find			2
" it 's a very difficult thing to deal with			2
personally , it 's just difficult for me to see the situation they 're in , " said @entity158			0
it 's a reality that 's not lost on his fellow crew members , including the commanding officer , @entity59			0
" we empathize with them and it 's tough on the human spirit to do it			0
but , we 're in the military			0
this is what we do			0

@entity31 are 90 - mile - long stretch of open water between the @entity34 , @entity2
it 's where many use makeshift rafts and boats in an attempt to reach @entity46
this year , @entity11 has seen the highest number of migrants in five years
