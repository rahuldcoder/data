@entity0 , @entity1 -- shopkeepers and school children in this remote @entity1 farming town giggle and point when @entity7 pedals by on her rusty red bicycle			1
the unwanted attention started a few months ago when the @entity1 high school student posted a video on @entity12			1
wearing a sleeveless pink top and standing next to a mirror showing her profile as she speaks , @entity13 announces to the camera , " hi , my name is @entity7			2
i 'm here to auction off my virginity			0
" @entity13 told @entity2 she made the offer because she was desperate to help her ailing mother			1
she heard about @entity24 , a @entity1 woman who reportedly sold her virginity for $ 780,000 on an @entity27 website seeking virgins			1
@entity24 has reportedly yet to finalize the deal and receive the money , and @entity1 is reportedly investigating whether the website should be charged with human trafficking			1
nevertheless , @entity24 has received widespread publicity and modeling contracts -- including a spread in @entity1 's version of @entity36			1
" i made up my mind right after my 18th birthday , " @entity13 said in an interview with @entity2 last month in her small , one - bedroom house			1
" that 's when my mother suffered a stroke			2
" the stroke left her mother bed - ridden , unable to feed herself or go to the bathroom alone			2
@entity13 said she looked for jobs and tried selling cosmetics and working as a waitress , but without a high school degree , the pay was minimal			1
" i would get 150 reais ( $ 75 ) for working all day , which would just pay the salary of someone to stay with my mother , " she said , after patiently feeding her mother a plate of reheated spaghetti			2
" there comes a time when you have to make decisions to get what you want			0
you have to be strong			0
" about a month ago , she said she used a friend 's @entity12 account to post the video of her offer , which she said got 3,000 hits on the first day			1
@entity12 has taken the post down and the account associated with it " due to multiple third - party notifications of copyright infringement , " although it has been widely reposted on the video sharing site			1
there are questions surrounding the authenticity of @entity13 's altruism			1
a @entity1 tv network offered to pay for her mother 's medical expenses if @entity13 called off the auction			1
while she initially accepted the offer during a television interview , she later rejected it because the network would not pay for a house in a different town where she could " start a new life			2
" there are also questions about whether her offer to auction off her virginity is just a ploy to attract media attention that could lead to lucrative deals			0
in october , @entity13 posted a @entity12 video auditioning for the next installment of the @entity1 version of " @entity100 , " which offers a $ 500,000 prize to the last housemate left on the show			1
in the video , she talks about her hobbies and says that if she wins , she will use the money to help her ailing mother			1
she later told @entity110 , which produces the @entity1 version of the show , that she has n't registered to be a contestant			0
@entity13 said she has received several bids for her virginity -- the highest one for 70,000 reais , or $ 35,000			2
prostitution is legal in @entity1			0
@entity13 's video initially set off a firestorm in her hometown , echoing across the country			2
" when she started the auction , people in the street threw coins at her when she went by , " said a local mechanic			0
" but i never looked at her differently			0
" today , attitudes in @entity0 are shifting , thanks in part to the national attention her story is getting			0
her neighbors seemed largely sympathetic , noting that @entity13 's only sister died young and that she never knew her father			2
" she had no one to go to , no one to help , so this is the only solution she found , " said one neighbor			0
" everyone has the right to decide what to do with their own body , even if that 's not the choice i would make , " said another			0
but her mother , speaking with difficulty from her bed with her daughter sitting beside her , said she is devastated			0
" it 's wrong , it 's wrong ! " she said			0
" she should look for work , she should n't prostitute herself			0
" yet , as her mother 's sole caregiver , @entity13 insists she has few options			1
" it 's a lot of responsibility to face alone , " she said , wiping away tears			0
" i 'm not really prepared			0
" lurid journey through @entity164 2009 : virginity for sale opinion : state ban on sex listings is dangerous @entity2 's @entity170 reported from @entity171 , @entity172 , and @entity2 's @entity173 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 .			1
