-- @entity1 came to @entity3 's rescue again to put the @entity5 champions into the @entity7 semifinals for the first time with a hard - fought 1 - 0 victory over @entity10 in @entity11 on saturday night as both teams missed a penalty			1
the striker , who scored the only goal in the second - round victory over @entity17 , netted the winner with eight minutes to play to become the leading scorer at the @entity21 tournament with five			1
@entity3 will now play @entity22 in @entity23 on wednesday for a place in final after the 2006 hosts thrashed @entity26 4 - 0 earlier on saturday			1
it will be a rematch of the @entity29 final , which @entity3 won 1 - 0			1
" we did n't play well mainly because we did n't get enough of the ball , " @entity3 coach @entity30 told reporters			2
" we are now among the four best teams in the world			0
our next opponents are @entity22 , who are the best team at the moment			0
" @entity10 , playing in the last eight for the first time , had a goal disallowed in the first half and should have taken the lead in the 59th minute but @entity45 's penalty was saved by @entity3 captain @entity46			1
@entity47 then had the chance to put the @entity49 ahead soon after but was also denied from the spot after having to retake his successful first attempt			0
@entity10 , whose coach @entity52 made six changes after the penalty shootout win over @entity56 in the previous round , easily contained @entity3 's renowned attacking prowess in a disappointing first half			1
" we had chances but did n't take them			0
i congratulate my players for their progress at the @entity7 , " @entity52 told reporters			0
the @entity65 felt aggrieved to have a 41st - minute strike by @entity67 ruled out after @entity45 strayed into a marginally offside position , but wasted a glorious chance to go ahead after @entity3 defender @entity70 was booked for dragging on the arm of @entity45			1
but the @entity73 player , who scored the winner against @entity56 , saw his shot saved by @entity46 -- and then at the other end @entity1 was hauled down when clear on goal by @entity78 , who was lucky not to be sent off			0
@entity47 coolly sent goalkeeper @entity79 the wrong way , but the @entity10 captain was more successful the second time after @entity83 referee @entity82 ruled that players had encroached into the penalty area before the initial kick was taken			2
@entity79 was lucky not to concede another penalty as he clattered into @entity88 while trying to gather the rebound , but was helpless when @entity3 finally made the breakthrough			0
substitute @entity91 fired a low shot onto the base of the woodwork , and @entity1 followed up with a strike that hit one post and bounced into the net off the other one			0
@entity10 substitutes @entity100 and @entity101 had late efforts blocked in quick succession by @entity46 , while @entity104 was denied a second by @entity79			2
it was another disappointing night for @entity104 's strike partner @entity106 , who was replaced by @entity88 with 20 minutes to play as he again looked well short of his usual high standards			1
@entity10 's defeat leaves neighbors @entity110 as @entity65 's only representative in the last four , facing the @entity112 on tuesday .			2

@entity3 will play @entity22 in the @entity7 semifinals after beating @entity10 1 - 0
striker @entity1 nets only goal in 82nd minute to go top of overall scoring charts
@entity65 had a goal ruled out and then missed a penalty in second half
