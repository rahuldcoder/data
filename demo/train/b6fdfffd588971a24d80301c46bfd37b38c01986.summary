-- " i 'm sorry i 'm late , it 's that i just woke up ! " laughs @entity0 , at eleven - thirty on a sunday morning in @entity1			1
" we worked until very late last night , " says the 39 - year - old in the rolling @entity7 accent we 've come to love from her character , @entity8 , on " @entity9			2
" about the late thing ? we 'll forgive her , because this is one busy woman			1
not only was she working on a shoot for @entity14 ( she is their new spokesperson ) , but she also just launched her @entity0 for @entity17 fashion line for women of all sizes			1
and she 's in not one but two new movies ( " @entity21 " and " @entity22 " ) , while filming her @entity25 - winning @entity24 show			2
today , the seriously funny actress -- who is mom to her own " @entity28 , " 20 - year - old son , @entity29 -- talks about everything from dreading workouts to the plastic surgery she 's so glad she decided not to get			1
q : the tagline of your fashion line is " work what you got			2
" how can we work what we 've got ? everybody has something			2
somebody has a good pair of legs , even though her midsection is a little chunky			2
so then you can wear tights with miniskirts or you wear tight leggings			2
and if you have nice cleavage , wear things that enhance that			2
@entity3 : the biggest celebrity health stories of 2011 q : was there a time you did n't love how you looked ? oh , of course ! not everybody 's confident their whole life			1
for a long time , i thought that my boobs were too big and i was , like , 14 years old , and i already had these huge boobs			0
i was very skinny also			0
and now that i 'm almost 40 -- we always have our insecurities as women			1
we 're never happy ! q : can you remember the day you started realizing , " wait a minute , i think i 've got it going on ! " in @entity72 we do learn to be more comfortable with our bodies			1
women are not shy to be in a bathing suit , in a g - string			0
but i also did a tv commercial for @entity78 when i was 17 on the beach in a bathing suit			0
and after that , everybody was like , " oh my god , that body			0
" and you know , you start to feel a little bit more confident if you have people thinking that you 're so fabulous ! [ @entity89 ] @entity3 : the hottest ways @entity91 lives healthy q : i guess it helps to have a cheerleading squad			0
of course , of course ! when i moved to @entity72 , i was more voluptuous , and i felt a little different			1
and one time , years ago , i remember my publicist [ at the time ] told me , " i think you should just reduce your boobs because nobody 's going to take you seriously here			0
" my mother almost had a heart attack			0
she was like , " @entity103 is going to punish you ! you ca n't cut your boobs ! " i do n't regret not doing it , because now it 's become a big part of @entity8			1
q : what made you realize , " i 'm going to keep my body the way it is " ? my mother screaming at me that @entity103 was gon na punish me -- what else do you want ! [ @entity89 ] q : oh , right , that would do it ! are you anti -- plastic surgery in general ? i 'm not against it at all			1
but i think that you should go into it more thinking that you want to look beautiful than trying to look young			1
because i do n't really think that plastic surgery can make you look young			1
it can make you look prettier , but if you go with the mentality of being young , i think that 's where accidents can happen			1
@entity3 : thinking about cosmetic surgery ? here 's how to get a better nip or tuck q : you 're a natural blonde , right ? yeah , about five years ago i was auditioning with this body and the attitude of a @entity136 woman , and it did n't match the stereotype of the @entity136 women in @entity91			1
i made it dark for a screen test and everybody really liked it			0
they did n't give me the movie , but i kept the hair color ! q : do you ever feel like people stereotype you ? oh yeah , of course			1
but i do n't mind it			1
i mean , it is the reality			0
i am a @entity136 woman : i 'm voluptuous , i 'm loud , i 'm exactly what a @entity136 woman is [ laughs ]			1
i mean , what am i going to go against it ? no. i do n't think there 's anything bad in being a @entity136 woman			1
what is it ? that we are loud , that we are passionate , that we are voluptuous ? i prefer to be called that than , " you 're boring ; you have a flat a * * ! " [ @entity89 ] q : do you have any stay gorgeous tricks that are n't from a bottle ? my mother always told me to make the last water in your shower really cold			1
i 've always done it			0
q : how are you most healthy ? and not so healthy ? i do n't smoke , i 've never done drugs			1
i think the most unhealthy thing is that i 'm obsessed with dessert			1
and it 's verrry hard for me not to eat it at least once a day			0
q : what are your favorites ? all of ' em. i mean , i can not ... it 's like you saying , " which one of your kids is your favorite ? " i ca n't do that ! oh ...			1
@entity103 ... [ her voice is wavering like it 's " @entity188 " ] it 's so difficult			0
tiramisu maybe ? or just a plain vanilla cake that 's homemade and warm and just out of the oven ? i love that			0
q : you talked to @entity195 a few years ago about how you beat thyroid cancer in 2000			0
how does going through a health scare at such a young age change you ? it changes your priorities			2
it 's a good thing when it comes out with a happy ending because it does make you appreciate things more			1
but , you know , you live your life as healthy as you can			0
i was twentysomething and i had never smoked , i had n't eaten red meat in years , so why did i have a cancer ? no one knows			2
q : what 's your biggest health regret ? you know what i wish ? my face is so much better , because i 've been putting sunblock since i was young on my face			2
nobody ever told me that i needed to put it in my @entity223 ! and so it is more sun - damaged than my face			0
it would n't have been difficult to put a little bit there			2
q : is it true you 're not a fan of gyms ? just working out ! [ @entity89 ] it 's paaaaaainful			0
i hired @entity235 , which is really fun			0
because i mean , if i go alone , i 'll sabotage myself			0
i 'll do half of the workout			0
so i need somebody to force me to do it			0
q : do you complain the whole time or do you just shut up and do it ? ohhh , the whooooole time ! i cry , i get on the floor , i 'm like , " i 'm gon na throw up , enough ! " i mean , he does n't care			1
q : how do you motivate yourself to work out if you 're too tired ? oh my @entity103 , i look at myself in the mirror			0
and i 'm like , i 'm almost 40 years old and i need to go ! q : so seeing your face in the mirror is just inspiration enough ? no , i 'm more looking at my a * * ! [ @entity89 ] or my legs , not my face ! q : what is your favorite way to de-stress ? to be with my son and my boyfriend [ @entity260 ] , just doing nothing			2
and i love lunches with my friends -- just talking and gossiping @entity195 2011			0
