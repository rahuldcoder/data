@entity0 , @entity1 -- after a chorus of cries for social justice echoed through the streets of @entity1 for days , protesters called for a time out wednesday			1
despite the anticipated lull in street marches , the government will beef up security with the deployment of elite police officers and firefighters			2
the protests , which started over a hike in bus fares , have had some effect			1
on wednesday , the state of @entity0 announced that the hike in bus fares would be reversed , state media reported			1
in addition , a handful of states have passed laws to lower the price of a city bus ticket since protests began , and politicians elsewhere showed signs of bending to the public pressure , saying they may also notch fares back down			1
@entity0 mayor @entity34 had earlier warned that eliminating the fare hikes would mean less investment in other areas , but in the end erased the increases			1
not satisfied protesters say the poorest are being short - changed while the government spends the large bills on new stadiums and glitzy infrastructure for the soccer @entity46 @entity1 is hosting next year and the @entity47 coming in 2016			1
they complain that corruption is driving up the costs			2
the country 's investment in those projects includes money for health and public transportation , deputy sports minister @entity50 has said			1
" there is absolutely nothing contradictory between organizing a @entity46 and investing in health and education , " he said			2
but such assurances have not been enough for protesters , who will crank marches back up thursday			1
tens of thousands have confirmed online that they will take to the streets once more cry to out against high taxes and living costs , and for better health care and better education			1
bigger , more festive wednesday 's day off is nothing out of the ordinary for @entity1 protesters , who also took saturday and sunday off			1
but it stands in glaring contrast to the loud , voluminous demonstrations that reverberated across several cities a day earlier			2
crowds originally protesting bus fares grew into multitudes decrying social injustice on tuesday as broad avenues filled to capacity for blocks			1
there were over 200,000 confirmed participants , according to the main organizer , the @entity89			1
the protests come amid the soccer @entity92 tournament , a friendly array of matches , in which the host country , @entity1 , plays against a small group of national teams from around the globe			0
the cup serves as a precursor to the @entity46			0
the @entity103 , made up of specially trained firefighters and police officers , will deploy to states hosting the games , the @entity102 said late tuesday			0
the government has stressed that the force 's mission is to mediate and not repress			0
@entity1 's president , @entity111 , told peaceful protesters tuesday that their message was being heard			1
she praised them as active participants in democracy and said her government is committed to " social transformation			2
" police for the most part stood back , and the atmosphere has grown festive and loud , with throngs singing and beating drums			0
are you there ? share photos or video , but stay safe " it actually reminded me of @entity129 , " protester @entity127 said			0
" all along the avenue , people supporting the cause kept switching their lights on and off in their offices and shouting their support from the windows			0
" path of rubble but hidden in the peaceful multitudes were bands of rowdies , who kicked down doors and broke windows ; looted shops , tipped over cars and set them on fire			0
it left a trail of rubble down the protest routes			2
@entity153 woke up to the smoldering aftermath tuesday morning			0
the @entity155 , who lives and works in @entity157 , took video of smashed store fronts as he arrived at his workplace and posted it to @entity162			0
@entity163 rose out of looted shops			0
across the street , a row of @entity165 stood bashed , with their electronic guts hanging out			0
his colleagues saw the trouble ignite the night before from their office window , they told him			0
" they witnessed a car set on fire in front of our building , " @entity174 said			0
" they told me they were worried that the building would catch on fire			0
" while asking police to back off from peaceful protesters , @entity111 has condemned " isolated and minor acts of violence , " telling police to confront them " with vigor			2
" @entity174 's colleagues in @entity157 wo n't let vandalism keep them off the streets			2
