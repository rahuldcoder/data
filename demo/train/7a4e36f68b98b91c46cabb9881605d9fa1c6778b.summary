-- tonight we find out whether it 's time for a team of destiny or a team that 's a new type of dynasty			0
@entity9 fans have really enjoyed this season of surprises , with their unheralded team battling into its first @entity13 in almost three decades			1
and @entity15 fans have really enjoyed the even - numbered seasons lately			1
it goes like this : 2010 , @entity13 champs			1
2011 , not even in the playoffs			0
2013 , a losing record			0
sure , you can argue that " dynasty " is a label that does n't apply to a team that does n't have a string of trophy wins and does n't come into each new season as the favorite to win another			1
the idea of any team winning titles every year pretty much evaporated in the last century			1
no team has even won back - to - back crowns since the @entity36 in 1998 and 1999			2
so what 's up with these @entity15 ? the secret of the @entity15 ' success really is n't a secret			1
it comes down to good managing and great pitching			0
@entity15 manager @entity44 told @entity45 : " you have to keep calm any way you can and relay that to the players			1
this is a special group			0
they do n't need a lot of help with that part			2
but the manager 's job also is the feel you get for which guys can handle ( pressure ) and who ca n't			2
" @entity62 stations ban @entity63 's ' @entity9 ' ahead of @entity13 that 's what each of his series winning teams have done , played with poise			1
they 've won the tight games , buoyed by the superb pitching and fielders who do n't make errors			1
" pitching and defense are going to win you games			0
i know it 's a cliche answer , but until you can prove to me otherwise , i 'll stick with that answer , " @entity15 reliever @entity80 told @entity81			1
7 reasons @entity62 is a winner the @entity15 are not like the @entity36 of the ' 50s when year after year they put the same nine on the field , and when @entity89 won more rings than fingers on one hand			1
sure , all - star catcher @entity93 has been a constant , but @entity94 notes that the rest of the lineup card has changed			2
" in the team 's three @entity13 pushes , it has had three different second basemen , left fielders , center fielders and closers			1
it has had two first basemen , shortstops , third basemen and right fielders , " writes @entity94			0
@entity44 says having some fresh faces each year gives a fresh desire to win			0
" that was part of our motivation when this whole thing started			0
let 's find a way to give them a chance and get them to the @entity13 , " he told reporters before the @entity13 began			1
it also helps when the new talent fills in the gaps left behind by departures and injuries			0
the big trouble facing the @entity15 on wednesday night is the visiting team factor			1
it 's been forever since a road team won a game 7 in the @entity13			1
it was 1979 when @entity133 took the title at @entity135			0
the @entity9 were involved in one of those games since , winning the @entity138 at home in a final game blowout			1
it was the franchise 's last sniff of glory			0
7 reasons @entity144 is a winner the likeable @entity9 have delighted not only @entity9 fans but hardcore baseball fans , too			1
they have perpetually been underdogs and it 's been refreshing to watch a small tv market team have a chance at a crown			0
but the players do n't think of themselves as party spoilers			2
" we know we 're a good team			0
to us , we 're not the underdogs			0
we 're just going out there and playing the game and having some fun , " third baseman @entity157 told @entity81			2
manager @entity161 said his team does n't pay attention to what the media says			1
they are only concerned with playing their best baseball , and in october , they have been			0
and it 's brought joy to fans all over			0
" i think @entity174 has fallen in love with this group because of their energy , their passion , their fun - loving nature , " @entity161 said before @entity173			2
" even through the most stressful times , you ca n't ( look ) in our dugout and not see them laughing and having a good time with each other , and i think people love seeing that			2
" @entity161 also said he foresees this team being pretty good for years , given a young core of rising stars			2
of course , even if they win tonight , it 's too early to use that " @entity196 " word .			0

the @entity15 have won two @entity13 in recent years
the @entity9 have n't won one since 1985
@entity15 *roster* has changed but their *method* of winning has n't
*royals* do n't pay attention to underdog label , they just go out to have fun
