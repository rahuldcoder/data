-- @entity2 @entity1 governor @entity1 has n't announced another run for office -- but his large campaign spending since winning re-election in 2011 suggests he still has some political ambitions in mind			1
@entity1 's campaign spending totaled $ 1.8 million in 2013 , according to analysis from @entity12 paper @entity11 published tuesday , and said that was more than any other politician in the state for that year			1
he spent more than $ 152,600 in 2012 and 2013 for flights to @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 -- lynchpin states that nearly all potential presidential candidates visit to swing votes in their favor			1

@entity1 has been one of a growing list of @entity32 governors who could run for president in 2016			2
@entity34 , an adviser to @entity1 who formerly served as the governor 's chief of staff , confirmed that the reported spending numbers were accurate , but said a closer look at @entity1 's expenses shows nothing unusual			1
" all of it was n't spent on travel or what not , " @entity34 said , pointing out that about $ 600,000 was spent on a public awareness campaign after @entity1 's education reform policies elicited a lawsuit from the @entity44			1

his firm , @entity58 is among the consultants who has received payments from @entity1 's campaign , according to @entity11			1

it 's a position eyed by presidential hopefuls			0
the @entity71 's top slot has been held by other potential 2016 contenders including @entity77 governor @entity76 , and is currently maintained by @entity79 governor @entity78			0
for months , pundits have speculated about @entity1 's potential 2016 presidential run			2
