-- army sgt. @entity2 's release from @entity4 captivity was largely celebrated at first			1
in the ensuing days , however , several serious issues about death , honor and the law have arisen , and those issues continue to grow			2
is @entity2 in military trouble ? any legal issues about @entity2 , who 's been accused of desertion , will be addressed once he has returned to @entity14 soil			1
he 's now being treated at @entity15 in @entity16			0
a senior @entity14 defense official said this week that @entity2 has not been classified a deserter and is still scheduled to be promoted to the rank of staff sergeant later this month			1
" we have not classified him as a deserter			0
at this point we do not have any understanding of why he left his camp that night " in june 2009 , the official said			0
military officials need to hear @entity2 's explanation of those events , the official said			1
he noted that the @entity31 promoted @entity2 in rank during his captivity			1
one expert , @entity34 , a professor at @entity35 , said the accusations raise " some very serious violations of the uniform code of military justice and arguably violations that led to the loss of life of members of his own unit in their efforts to recover him			0
" " there 's going to be a very deliberate and careful effort to develop the facts , although that also raises complicating issues related to whether or not he is entitled to a @entity53 - type warning under the military code , which might lead him to say he does n't want to talk about it at all , " @entity34 said			0
@entity34 spent 22 years in the @entity31 as an officer and civilian employee , with his last post as the @entity31 's senior law of war expert in the office of the judge advocate general			1
were @entity14 soldiers killed searching for @entity2 ? there is controversy over whether soldiers were killed , directly or indirectly , in the search for @entity2 after he was taken captive by the @entity4			1
former soldiers involved in the operations to find @entity2 asserted to @entity0 this week that at least six soldiers were killed in the search for @entity2 in 2009			1
they provided the soldiers ' names and their dates of death , with circumstances for some of them			0
a day later , @entity79 , a former member of @entity2 's battalion who searched for him that summer in 2009 , wrote in the @entity81 that eight soldiers ' deaths were tied to the @entity2 search			1
@entity79 provided the eight soldiers ' names -- including six names that @entity0 earlier reported			0
@entity89 and @entity31 officials have looked at the claims , and " right now there is no evidence to back that up , " a @entity14 official told @entity0 on thursday			1
asked about the accusations , defense secretary @entity94 told reporters wednesday that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers dying as a result of the efforts to find @entity2			1
@entity2 's former team leader , former sgt. @entity102 , told @entity0 , " i ca n't say for a fact and i do n't know if there is really anyone who can prove that soldiers died on a directed mission to find @entity2			1
however every mission , especially in the following two or more months , those were directed missions			0
everything after that , they were still missions that were in search of @entity2			1
... @entity2 leaving changed the mission			2
" @entity2 : strong , well - rounded and easy to talk to , friends say did @entity2 desert ? an @entity31 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded that @entity2 left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will , according to a @entity14 military official briefed on the report			1
the official spoke to @entity0 tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information			0
there was no definitive finding that @entity2 deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something @entity31 officials could n't learn without talking to the soldier			1
the investigation included interviews with members of @entity2 's unit , none of whom reported seeing him go , the official said			1
it is " unfair " to @entity2 and his family to presume anything about his motivations for leaving the base , @entity143 said wednesday			2
secretary of the army @entity149 said tuesday that " a comprehensive , coordinated " review of @entity2 's case will be conducted			1
the review " will include speaking with sergeant @entity2 to better learn from him the circumstances regarding his disappearance and captivity , " @entity149 said			2
earlier in the week , @entity143 declined to address directly detailed questions about @entity2 's case -- particularly accusations that he deserted , as some of his former brothers - in - arms allege			1
before he went missing , @entity2 spoke of wanting to get lost in the mountains and walking to @entity164 , his comrades said			2
" i believe he totally deserted , " said former staff sgt. @entity165 , @entity2 's former squad leader			1
opinion : five tough ethics issues in @entity2 swap did @entity170 break the law ? @entity2 's captors freed him in exchange for the release of five @entity4 fighters held at the @entity14 prison in @entity177 , @entity178 , but the @entity170 administration did n't tell @entity180 of the releases			1
under law , the @entity182 has to give a 30 - day notice to @entity185 before any terrorists are transferred from @entity177			0
@entity182 national security adviser @entity187 defended president @entity170 's decision not to notify @entity180			1
" given the acute urgency of the health condition of sergeant @entity2 , and given the president 's constitutional responsibilities , it was determined that it was necessary and appropriate not to adhere to the 30 - day notification requirement , because it would have potentially meant that the opportunity to get sergeant @entity2 would have been lost , " @entity189 said			1
the president did indeed break the letter of the law , said @entity200 , a law professor at @entity201			2
but there are questions about the law itself , he added			0
" there 's two different questions here			0
one is , did he violate the federal law ? the answer to that is most obviously yes , " @entity200 said			0
" the second question is whether that law is constitutional			0
and the answer to that is more difficult			0
" this is just a notice requirement			0
there are thousands of such notice requirements			0
and the problem with the president 's argument is there 's no limiting principle , that he could argue that all national security laws could fall into the same unilateral power , " @entity200 said			0
@entity224 wanted tougher deal for @entity2 did @entity2 help the @entity4 ? there 's no evidence that @entity2 helped the enemy directly , though he 's certainly been used in @entity4 propaganda			1
what has partly fueled this accusation is how @entity2 reportedly had sent e-mails to his parents denouncing @entity14 activities in @entity235 , according to a 2012 story in @entity238 magazine			1
@entity2 's former comrades also wondered if he gave the @entity4 intelligence because the enemy executed " very calculated , very methodical " strikes after @entity2 's disappearance , said @entity102			1
but a @entity14 official who has been briefed on the initial @entity31 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after @entity2 disappeared told @entity0 that @entity2 's commanders referred to him as " a good soldier " in that report			1
some of his teammates said he had expressed " boredom " and thought his unit was too passive and should have been " kicking down doors , " the official said			0
@entity4 video shows @entity2 's release in @entity235 was @entity2 tortured ? it 's too early to say how severely @entity2 was mistreated during his five years of captivity			1
officials have yet to state the findings of their medical examination of @entity2 following his release saturday			2
a @entity4 propaganda video of the handover of @entity2 showed him looking gaunt and blinking repeatedly -- as if in disbelief or shock			2
" he does n't look that bad to me , " remarked @entity265 , a former @entity266 lead international hostage negotiator , about @entity2 's condition			1
some experts speculate @entity2 may have experienced @entity271 , in which he may have emotionally bonded with his @entity4 captors over the five years			2
why is his unit coming out against him ? there 's something new and something old motivating the former members of @entity2 's unit to condemn him			2
first there were the immediate reports that @entity2 was being hailed as a hero			2
those accounts incensed the former soldiers			0
the comrades also remembered 2009 and how they searched for @entity2			2
" he walked off , " said former @entity285			0
@entity286 , 27 , of @entity287			0
" he left his guard post			0
nobody knows if he defected or he 's a traitor or he was kidnapped			0
what i do know is , he was there to protect us , and instead he decided to defer from @entity14 and go and do his own thing			2
i do n't know why he decided to do that , but we spent so much of our resources , and some of those resources were soldiers ' lives			0
" in fact , the former soldiers say they are so outraged that they are speaking out publicly at significant peril			0
the former servicemen said they earlier signed nondisclosure agreements about the disappearance and search for @entity2 , but they 're now violating it			2
the six soldiers at center of @entity311 debate is that illegal ? the former soldiers may well be in open violation of that contract			0
but they say they will risk punishment			0
" it 's certainly a possibility , but i do n't think that i could have continued to go on without being able to share with you and the people the true things that happened in this situation , because if you guys are n't made aware of it , it will just go on , he will be a hero , and nobody is going to be able to know the truth , " said former @entity31 sgt. @entity317 , whose back is tattooed with the names of three soldiers who purportedly died while searching for @entity2			1
@entity31 officials did n't immediately return a @entity0 request for comment about what consequences , if any , the former soldiers may face if they 're in violation of a nondisclosure agreement			2
for those former troops , honor is at stake			0
" for me , he 's a deserter			0
@entity14 needs to know , " said @entity165 , the former squad leader			2
" he 's back , and he needs to be held accountable			0
" was @entity2 swap legal ? depends on who you ask official : @entity31 will review freed soldier @entity2 's case but it 's not first priority @entity2 hurts @entity170 's most promising chance to close @entity356 @entity0 's @entity357 and @entity358 contributed to this report .			1

new : @entity89 finds " no evidence " about soldier deaths in @entity2 case , source says
whether @entity2 is in trouble with the @entity31 will have to wait until he 's in @entity14
controversy roils over whether soldiers were killed because of search
@entity170 broke the law in not notifying @entity180 , professor says
