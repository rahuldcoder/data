-- @entity1 has never played in a @entity3 semifinal before , and he has never been ranked no. 1			1
@entity5 lost his top spot at the @entity8 event in @entity9 a year ago , and he wants it back			1
before this week the @entity10 had never made it past the second round of the 64 - man tournament in 11 attempts			0
ideally they would be meeting in sunday 's 18 - hole final in a showdown to see who will depose @entity19 as golf 's top dog , but instead they will have to clash in the semi			1
the winner of that morning match will play either @entity26 or @entity27 , with the @entity28 assured of a shot at the trophy for the first time since @entity32 took it home for the third occasion in 2008			1
" i think it 's the match that most people wanted and definitely the match that i wanted , " world @entity35 told reporters after beating @entity39 's @entity38 3 & 2 in his quarterfinal on saturday			0
" i 'm excited about tomorrow , it should be a lot of fun and very exciting for everyone involved			0
" all i need to do is focus on the match tomorrow morning , and then i think the biggest task for both of us , me and @entity5 , is getting yourself so much up for the semifinal			2
" you have to get yourself up for that again			0
so that will be the tough task because obviously both of us feel you 've got to get past each other -- for @entity5 to get back to number one and me to get there for the first time			2
" you have to put your all into that and then whoever wins tomorrow morning , you get yourself back up again to go back out tomorrow afternoon and win the whole thing			0
" while @entity1 has already won the @entity67 at the age of 22 , the 38 - year - old @entity5 is still waiting for his first major victory -- though he has topped the @entity71 money list and ended @entity32 ' record - breaking run at the top of the rankings in 2010			1
" we 've played a lot together			0
it will be a good match -- i hope it will be a great match , that we both play well and make a lot of birdies , " @entity5 said of the clash with his @entity80 teammate after his 4 & 2 victory over @entity83 's @entity82			2
" my priorities were to win major championships and win @entity8 because i have n't ever won any			2
i 've been at no. 1 a couple of times			0
it would be a different way of thinking to me compared to @entity1 , who has n't been no. 1			2
he may be thinking about it , but my main goal is to play well or play as well as i 've been playing tomorrow morning and try and win that match			0
" neither @entity26 nor @entity27 are ranked inside the top 20 , but have both been in fine form at the @entity99 course this week			1
@entity100 went through after thrashing @entity28 @entity80 teammate @entity101 6 & 5 in the shortest quarterfinal since the tournament started in 1999			1
" @entity101 could n't find the putter today , which is rare for him , because he 's a great putter , " @entity26 said of his 14th - ranked opponent			1
" i got lucky in that aspect			0
but i played solid , did n't make any bogeys and did n't give many holes -- and kept the pressure on him			0
that was nice to do			0
" @entity27 , ranked 42nd and a three - time winner on the @entity114 , cruised past @entity116 's @entity115 4 & 3 , and has yet to play past the 16th hole this week			1
" i do n't think too many people picked me to win , " said @entity27 , who is looking to follow in the example of last year 's winner @entity19 and his predecessor @entity120 -- none of the trio are long hitters .			1

@entity126 @entity1 to play third - ranked @entity5 in @entity3 semifinals
the winner will depose @entity19 at the top of the world rankings if they can also win the title
the @entity28 will have a shot at the title for the first time since @entity32 won it in 2008
@entity28 @entity80 player @entity26 will play *compatriot* @entity27 in the other semifinal in @entity9
