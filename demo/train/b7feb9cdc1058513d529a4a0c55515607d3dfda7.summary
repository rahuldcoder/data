-- remember how we were all freaking out on @entity2 , 1999 , convinced that the world as we know it would end -- at the hands of machines , of course ? well , we weathered that storm and then some			0
still , as we shamble forward into the next decade , it might be prudent to take pause and take stock of the years behind us			0
translation : back up your stuff			0
think of it as stockpiling food and building a fallout shelter for the 21st century			0
we have a ton of information , photos and memories scattered around the web that we would be loathe to lose , and while it 's unlikely that the entire @entity23 is going to come crashing down in the next week or so , it still might be wise to put some of that stuff in an iron box for safe keeping			2
read on , and @entity27 and i will show you how to ... ... back up your @entity30 we 're coming pretty close to living our lives on @entity30 -- it 's our photo album , diary and mailbox , all in one -- so why leave all that info up to the whims of the all - mighty servers ? this october , the social network got hip to data portability after it started allowing users to download their profiles -- photos , statues , updates , videos and all			1
the process is really too simple to forgo			0
here 's how you can stow away your social life for safekeeping : 1 )			0
go to @entity54 2 )			0
click on " @entity55 " and allow @entity30 to download your info 3 )			1
wait for an e-mail that will let you know your info is ready ( it takes a while , what with all the stuff you probably have on @entity30 ) 4 )			1
go through the security test that allows you to download your info ( kudos on that one , @entity30 ) , and , voila , your profile is ported to your desktop in a nifty folder			1
do this before you go through with that @entity75 's resolution to make your profile less scandalous -- you know , for when you 're old and gray and full of sleep and nodding by the fire			0
... back up your tweets yes , the @entity81 is now hoarding tweets , but that does n't do much for the casual user looking to keep a log of his own mundane musings , now does it ? thankfully , you 're got some options			0
there 's @entity89 , which lets you back up your data as well as mine it for information and statistics			2
( be warned , this service takes a looooong time to gather your info )			0
and if @entity98 does n't strike your fancy , @entity100 , a site we covered back in 2009 , will track your data back to 2007 , and , using @entity104 , will even grab your timeline , tweets from friends and direct messages			0
@entity109 , a paid , @entity111 - like ( rip ) tool , also lets you store your tweets -- you can also back up or archive tweets from other usernames or from hashtags , as well as add favorites from a username and turn links embedded in tweets into bookmarks			2
... back up your blog after @entity123 's epic outage the other week , we showed you all how to back up your blogs			0
well , we 're just going to reiterate that right now , along with some solutions for @entity127 as well			1
remember how you felt when your mom threw away all your old journals , crammed to the margins with angsty poetry ? well , that 's not a feeling one would like to replicate later in life ( unless it was relief -- in which case , disregard )			0
@entity123 last year , @entity123 launched a backup app that allows users to save their blogs so that they can be viewed on any computer , burned to a cd or hosted as an archive of static html files			1
the app is super easy to use : simply download , enter your @entity123 sign - in info and save your blog to your desktop			1
you can launch the app and backup more info every time you post as well			1
note , this app is only for @entity156 ( 10.5 or higher ) , but there are other options for those who use different operating systems			2
@entity127 if your blog or website uses @entity127 , grabbing a backup file of all your posts , pages and comments is easy			1
in the @entity127 dashboard , just go to @entity168 , @entity169 and choose what types of posts you want to export			1
if you want a backup of your entire wordpress database , the excellent @entity173 plugin can make scheduled database backups for your @entity127 site at intervals you choose and even e-mail you the backup file			1
... back up your photos if you 're like millions of internet users , you probably upload most of your photos to a photo - sharing site like @entity183 or @entity30			1
while you 're backing up your blog entries , tweets and @entity30 messages , it might be a good idea to go ahead and archive all of your photos , too			1
if nothing else , this is a great way to destroy the evidence from that sorority beer bong tournament in college			0
@entity183 is a great service and in terms of reliability , it 's consistently solid			1
what 's less consistent is the whims of its parent company , @entity198			0
if the @entity111 debacle has taught us anything , it 's that @entity198 is n't afraid to sell off or shut down a service with millions of daily users			2
lots of apps and tools let you back up your @entity183 photo stream , but a quick , fuss - free way to unload years of photo uploads is the @entity213 app @entity214			1
the app works on @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 and downloads a copy of each photo in your stream to a folder of your choice			2
be aware that while this will grab each and every photo , tags , titles and photo sets are not preserved			0
there a few other alternatives if you 're willing to invest more time in the process , but @entity214 gets the job done			2

@entity30 allows users to download their profiles through *account* *setttings*
in @entity127 , go to @entity168 , @entity169 and choose the posts you want to export
@entity213 app @entity214 lets you backup @entity183 photos
