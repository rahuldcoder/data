@entity0 -- house speaker @entity2 is again facing strong opposition from a group of conservatives who are trying to derail his strategy as time runs out to avert a shutdown			1
they are ripping his plan to kick the fight about the president 's executive order on immigration until next year , arguing that voters who supported @entity17 in last month 's midterm elections expect @entity19 to wage the battle now			1
the resistance was expected , but it 's not expected to be fatal to the bill			0
@entity2 and top @entity25 @entity24 leaders knew that any plan short of barring all funding for federal agencies that issue new visas would be rejected by hardliners			1
while the group is loud , and is demanding multiple changes in return for their support , multiple @entity25 @entity24 aides and members are skeptical it will cause the bill to fail			1
but with the @entity25 vote likely coming next wednesday - just a day before the government is slated to run out of money - the continued push and pull between conservatives on both sides of the @entity43 and their leaders will keep the drama high right up until the last minute			1
on tuesday , @entity25 @entity24 leaders outlined a bill to fund most federal agencies for a full year			2
but the bill would only approve money for the @entity50 - which issues new visas - through march			0
in addition , @entity51 scheduled scheduled a vote for thursday on a measure authored by @entity56 @entity24 rep. @entity55 , a conservative who often breaks with leaders , that explicitly calls the president 's immigration actions unconstitutional			2
@entity62 @entity24 sen. @entity24 -- who helped coordinate conservatives ahead of last year 's government shutdown -- made the unusual move wednesday of crossing over to the @entity25 side of the @entity43 to join a press conference with a handful of @entity25 conservatives			1
@entity24 did n't mention @entity2 's name , but his presence with about a half dozen @entity25 members was essentially a stick in the eye to the speaker			1
the @entity76 made his opinion clear on the latest @entity25 @entity24 plan telling the crowd he opposed " having a meaningless show vote			1
" the move clearly frustrated allies of @entity24 leadership in the @entity25			2
when asked about the rally , @entity85 @entity24 rep. @entity84 told @entity1 flatly that " sen. @entity24 needs to stay in the @entity88			0
" referring to last year 's shutdown that many credit @entity24 with instigating , @entity84 added : " i think sen. @entity24 wants to fan the flames here but i think everyone here has become more savvy to his ways			0
" @entity88 @entity24 leaders and their aides expressed confidence the @entity25 bill would get enough @entity24 support to pass the bill and send it to the @entity88			1
they adamantly oppose a government shutdown and the political damage they fear it would do just as @entity17 are taking control of the chamber			1
" there 's not going to be a government shutdown , " incoming senate majority leader @entity110 told @entity111 on wednesday			1
" obviously , we think the president has been way out of line with his executive amnesty and we certainly do n't approve of that			0
but , you know , shutting down agencies of the government that have nothing to do with immigration serves no purpose other than to rattle the economy			0
" those @entity17 opposed to the bill say along with @entity24 , other @entity88 conservatives like @entity127 of @entity128 , @entity129 of @entity130 and @entity131 of @entity132 are pressing for the @entity25 to take a bolder stance			1
some of these conservatives are complaining that this latest plan from @entity24 leaders does n't match the rhetoric they used after the president laid out the details of his plans on immigration last month			2
" it 's hard for me with every major figure in our party -- starting with @entity150 coming down to the lowliest of members like myself -- saying we are going to do everything we can to stop this and to do nothing to stop it really hurts , " @entity143 rep. @entity143 of @entity144 told reporters wednesday			0
but @entity25 @entity24 aides say that discussions among members are n't turning up opposition from large numbers of members outside the group that typically splits with leaders on annual spending bill votes			2
@entity62 @entity167 rep. @entity167 , who was recently elected to head up an influential group of @entity25 conservatives , told @entity1 late tuesday he thought what @entity2 outlined was " a good strategy			1
" " we are where we are , and it 's still a decent way to handle it and still provide some ability to check the president later on , " @entity167 said			0
@entity178 @entity177 rep. @entity177 was among a group of conservative members who met with @entity25 majority leader @entity181 on wednesday morning			2
he told @entity1 he is still reviewing the details , but is open to supporting the leadership 's plan			0
" you fight strategically , " @entity177 stressed , noting he still serves in the @entity185			0
he said despite @entity188 like @entity24 and other outside groups urging a major effort to strip out money for the executive action , the reality is that until next year , @entity193 still control the @entity88 so it 's important to look " at the long term battle			0
" it 's possible some tweaks are made to the plan			0
there is some discussion about moving the date on the provision in the spending bill that funds the @entity50 to late january , or sometime in february so that the newly sworn in @entity88 and @entity25 can try to work on a strategy earlier to challenge the immigration plans			2
@entity84 predicted that @entity17 will still need some democrats will back the measure			0
that 's been the case with every annual and short term spending bill that has come to the floor since @entity2 became speaker			1
@entity25 @entity193 are holding back on how they will approach the vote - saying they are still waiting on final details			1
on tuesday , @entity216 @entity215 called the @entity24 plan " a game " and " bad policy , " but declined to say he would urge his colleagues to oppose it			0
@entity223 @entity222 suggested he could support the plan			0
for now , @entity193 are once again enjoying sitting back and watching the public feud among @entity17 .			0

@entity19 must pass *legislation* by dec. 11 to avoid a government shutdown
conservatives are pushing back on a plan from speaker @entity2
