middle school student @entity0 was simply stating his truth about the school principal who inspires him in his rough @entity5 neighborhood			1
featured in the wildly popular " @entity8 " photo series in january , a picture of @entity0 along with his sentiments went viral , and a subsequent fundraiser pulled in more than $ 1 million for his school			1
that 's how @entity0 , 13 , ended up at the @entity13 on thursday			1
the young man ; his inspirational principal , @entity15 ; and " @entity8 " creator @entity16 all got the chance to meet @entity18			1
( that 's @entity19 in @entity18 's seat in the @entity22			2
) " you do n't do things alone , " @entity18 told @entity0 , according to @entity16 's blog			1
" nobody does things alone			2
" for a young man like you , you should never be too afraid or too shy to look for people who can encourage you or mentor you , " @entity18 said			2
" there are a lot of people out there who want to provide advice and support to people who are trying to do the right thing			2
so you 'll have a lot of people helping you			2
just always remember to be open to help			2
never think that you know everything			2
and always be ready to listen			2
" it 's been a wild ride for @entity0 , @entity45 and their school , @entity48 , a middle school in @entity50 , @entity5			1
it 's known as a " safe zone in a crime - plagued neighborhood			2
" after @entity0 's post took off , @entity16 launched a campaign in late january to benefit the school through a summer trip to @entity58			1
the goal of the trip was to broaden students ' horizons and expand their idea of their potential , @entity16 wrote on the campaign page			2
the fundraising campaign 's rapid success speaks in part to the reach of " @entity8 , " which has a social media following of nearly 12 million on @entity71 alone			1
it 's also a testament to the ability of social media to breathe new life into a feel - good story			0
the first inspirational post featured a picture of @entity0 in a housing project in @entity50			0
he describes @entity45 as the most influential person in his life			0
" when we get in trouble , she does n't suspend us			0
she calls us to her office and explains to us how society was built down around us			0
and she tells us that each time somebody fails out of school , a new jail cell gets built			1
and one time she made every student stand up , one at a time , and she told each one of us that we matter			1
" in a posting on the " @entity8 " @entity71 page , @entity45 talked about the discouragement she felt before the campaign			1
" before all of this happened for our school , i felt broken , " she said			1
" and i think the world felt a little broken too , because a lot of bad things have been happening lately , especially between black people and white people			0
but all of you gave people a reason to feel a little less broken			0
" the picture of @entity0 has been widely shared and drew more than 1 million likes on the " @entity8 " @entity71 page , compelling @entity16 to dig deeper			1
" i ask people all the time about the most influential person in their life , and he was the first person who ever told me his principal , " @entity16 wrote in an email			1
" then when i met ms. @entity15 , i could not have been more impressed			0
she is a force of nature			0
when she let me sit in on a staff meeting , i got a front - row seat to the challenges that her school faces , and i wanted to be involved in the solution			1
" @entity45 and @entity16 discussed how the " humans of @entity125 " community could help further the school 's vision , @entity16 said in a @entity71 post			1
they decided to create a fund to provide each incoming sixth - grade class a chance to get out of their neighborhood and visit @entity58			1
" this is a neighborhood that does n't necessarily expect much from our children , so at @entity48 we set our expectations very high			0
we do n't call the children ' students , ' we call them ' scholars			0
' our color is purple			0
our scholars wear purple , and so do our staff , " @entity45 told @entity16 , who featured her picture on " @entity8			1
" " because purple is the color of royalty			0
i want my scholars to know that even if they live in a housing project , they are part of a royal lineage going back to great @entity155 kings and queens			0
they belong to a group of individuals who invented astronomy and math. and they belong to a group of individuals who have endured so much history and still overcome			0
when you tell people you 're from @entity50 , their face cringes up			0
but there are children here that need to know that they are expected to succeed			0
" the campaign 's scope has expanded as its pot has grown			0
initially , it was intended to cover lodging and transportation costs for three @entity48 classes to make the trip to the @entity181 , @entity182 , campus			0
in an update friday , @entity16 said that funds raised beyond the initial goal would go toward summer programming for the school			1
" learning stops during the summer for my scholars			1
we have what is called a ' summer slide , ' " @entity45 says on the fundraising campaign page			2
" they need a safe place where they can do activities and continue to grow their minds			0
" @entity16 posted that because of the campaign 's success , " we are starting a scholarship fund available to the graduates of @entity48			0
a committee of @entity48 educators and administrators will choose the recipients each year			0
" the scholarship fund will be named for @entity0 , the student who started it all , who will be the fund 's first recipient , @entity16 announced .			1
