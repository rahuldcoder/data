-- it 's just water			0
of course it is frozen in the form of ice			0
driving on ice is a fool 's errand			0
on ice it is hard to stop ( or start ) moving			0
on ice , vehicle control is difficult at best			0
you do n't need to be a transportation engineer to know that crashes increase with snow and especially ice , with its reduced friction			1
the problem is not that @entity19 got snow , but that the snow turned into ice			1
should @entity19 have been better prepared ? in retrospect , the answer is obvious			1
in prospect it should have been as well			0
while it 's hot in the summer , @entity19 is in the foothills of the @entity29 , not the beaches of the @entity31			1
in the past eight decades , it has snowed 4 inches or more 11 times in @entity19			1
there are periodic ice storms			0
according to @entity36 , the average low temperature in january is 34 degrees f , just above freezing			0
in other words , half the time in january the daytime low is below 34			0
i lived in @entity19 for five years			1
as a freshman , i remember a cold spell in january 1985 , when @entity44 's second inauguration was canceled in @entity45 because of cold , and @entity46 , where i was a student , had a delayed opening because it was 8 degrees			0
so winter is something that leaders should be aware of in @entity50			2
@entity19 does not get as much snow as @entity52 , my current home , and where we have stared down a polar vortex , and are now blanketed with about 2 feet of snow			1
@entity19 is certainly not as cold as @entity52 , where unusually , school was canceled two days this week , and five days this school year , and we now look at ice planet @entity58 ( where @entity60 and friends were based at the opening of " @entity64 " ) as an improvement			1
but @entity19 still experiences winter			1
@entity19 still has access to forecasts from the @entity68			1
this storm was not a surprise			1
there are several strategies for dealing with ice storms			0
officials could have tried to prevent the ice			2
unfortunately weather control is not yet very practical			2
the city and state could have tried to mitigate the ice			0
there are many techniques for salting and sanding roads that either prevent ice from forming , melt the ice or make it easier to travel on ice			2
this requires a fleet of vehicles and drivers that are prepared well before the weather event and that continue to be deployed until the roads are cleared			1
the risk is the city and state spend money on preparations for bad weather that does not come			2
such spending is standard operating procedure in northern cities such as @entity52 , where snow and ice are almost guaranteed , but it may not be worthwhile if the ice is infrequent			2
opinion : when 2.6 inches of snow made hell freeze over @entity19 could have tried to avoid the ice			1
if officials knew ice was coming ( and they should have , the weather forecasts were not highly guarded state secrets ) , they should have canceled schools and encouraged people to stay home			1
the risk is you cancel school and it only rains , or the storm changes course			2
officials who cancel school , only to see the weather improve , look bad , are considered " fraidy - cats , " will be mocked by talking heads and monday morning quarterbacks , and more importantly will have a harder time making the right decision the next time			1
a real leader is not so insecure			1
@entity132 mayor @entity131 warned his city about @entity134 despite perhaps being ( in retrospect ) too conservative in his warnings about @entity137			0
in the end , we should ask : is missing a day of school , or working from home instead of the office really the @entity143 ? instead what officials in @entity50 did was accept the damage ( in the form of traffic congestion , crashes , people sleeping in place in their cars and schools instead of at home ) caused by the ice			1
this outcome required no advance preparation or forethought			0
in fact a debacle of this magnitude required a careful absence of preparation			0
worse , everything shut down at once			0
dismissals were not coordinated , exacerbating congestion			0
in the end though , the main problem was not that everyone left work and school at the same time			0
the problem was they were all there in the first place			0
in the long term , the @entity19 area could do much more to avoid its routine congestion			1
but in the short term , if you can not prevent the special congestion caused by the weather , avoid it			2
is weather getting weirder ? i do n't know			1
is weather getting more predictable ? most definitely			2
the science is improving , and the measurements are getting more precise , and there are many more of them , all of which make short - range forecasts very accurate			2
our politicians should listen to the scientists sometimes			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			1

@entity196 : @entity19 area should have been prepared for the weather
he says @entity19 gets little snow , but gets weather forecasts . storm was not a surprise
officials should have kept people off the roads , @entity207 says
@entity207 : real leaders are n't insecure about risking such decisions
