-- president @entity1 on friday urged high school students to e-mail , tweet , and teach their parents to tweet a message to @entity6 to prevent student loan interest rates from doubling on july 1			1
in his continuing push to extend the current 3.4 % interest rate charged on federal student loans , @entity1 told students at a @entity13 high school that the goal is to provide all @entity15 with the best possible education			1
" we ca n't price the middle class out of a higher education , " the president said , sounding a theme of his re-election campaign			2
" that 's why we 've got to make college more affordable			0
" he made no mention of @entity27 , his all - but - certain opponent in november , but took aim at @entity29 who passed a measure last week that would pay for extending the lower student loan rate by cutting from a health care fund that promotes preventive care			1
@entity1 and @entity36 @entity35 want to pay the measure 's $ 6 billion cost by eliminating some corporate tax loopholes			1
in remarks almost identical to previous speeches to college students on the issue , @entity1 said @entity15 is not about a few people doing well while everyone else struggles			2
" @entity15 's about giving everybody a chance to do well , " he said to applause and cheers			0

" i believe in you			0
" the @entity71 warned last week that @entity1 would veto the student loan measure passed by @entity29			1
the @entity36 will vote next week on its own version pushed by @entity35 , and the two chambers are expected to then try to negotiate a compromise version .			1
