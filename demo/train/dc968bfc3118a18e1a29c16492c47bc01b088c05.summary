-- @entity1 was studying at the @entity2 when she met @entity3 in the early ' 60s			1
he was doing stand - up comedy in @entity5 when the two were set up on a blind date			0
they fell in love and she left school to support his burgeoning career in entertainment			0
by 1964 , the two were married and they would go on to have five children together			0
in 1997 , their son @entity16 ( who inspired the character @entity18 ) was murdered , and a few years later dr. @entity19 did a one - on - one with @entity20 explaining how she 'd eventually been able to find joy after mourning the loss of a child			1
throughout that interview it was so clear that you were looking at the real - life @entity27 that even @entity20 seemed a bit star - struck by her poise and grace			0
during her 2000 appearance on @entity20 , @entity1 revealed : " i became keenly aware of myself in my mid-thirties			1
i went through a transition			0
i decided to go back to school , because i had dropped out of college to marry @entity3 when i was 19			1
i had five children , and i decided to go back			2
i did n't feel fulfilled educationally			0
i dropped out of school at the end of my sophomore year			0
so i went back , and when i did , my self - esteem grew			2
i got my master 's , then decided to get my doctoral degree			2
education helped me to come out of myself			0
" when asked why she was n't content to just settle for being the wife of a famous entertainer she continued : " i do n't know exactly what it was , except that for me , integrity is important			2
for me friendships are important , family is important , and it is a blessing if we can have monetary benefits			0
that 's wonderful , and i love it			2
but i have to have the security of people who really care about me , and me about them			0
i want to be surrounded by people who have integrity			0
and , of course , my name is @entity1 , not @entity62			1
" that was a beautiful answer			0
but a lot has changed since then			0
these days , @entity19 is standing alongside her husband during what may turn out to be the worst month of his long career			1
for the last few weeks , the beloved tv dad who used to sell us @entity71 pudding pops has been at the center of an ever - growing scandal			0
he has canceled several appearances , @entity75 has postponed the launch of his stand - up special , @entity74 nixed plans for a new comedy show , and this week @entity81 became the latest woman to make allegations against him ; telling @entity85 that he raped her in 1982 after she 'd done a stint in rehab			0
@entity3 is arguably the most successful @entity89 - @entity88 performer in television history , but this is n't the first time he has found himself under scrutiny for extramarital affairs			1
in his biography , " @entity3 : his @entity104 , " @entity97 makes mention of the legendary comedian 's " roving eye " and even tells an anecdote about how he finally cut back on his womanizing by breaking up with his long - time girlfriend			1
now it seems those softball admissions about having a weakness for beautiful women may have been shrouding something much more sinister than an affair			2
from @entity111 : dear @entity3 , heed your own advice and be accountable in the last decade alone , more than a dozen women have accused @entity3 of rape or sexual assault			1
no formal charges have ever been successfully filed , so even with all the media speculation , these claims are technically only allegations			0
but there is one person in this melee whose anguish is virtually indisputable : his wife , @entity1			1
so how does a woman like that end up spending 50 years of her life beside a man who is now alleged to be a serial rapist ? one can only imagine the embarrassment she must be experiencing through all this			0
but her dilemma is a lot more common than you may think			0
in a world that asks you to be a mother , a wife , a businesswoman and an alluring sexual being , women grapple with finding the balance between respecting themselves and prioritizing their relationships			1
while many say they would leave a spouse who cheats , experts estimate that approximately 50 - 75 % of couples rocked by an affair stay together			0
there are many reasons why some women choose to stay : the fear of being alone , financial dependency , belief that they can alter the behavior of their mate , professional status of their partner , deep emotional investment and family obligations			2
it is hard enough to come back from infidelity in private , let alone when you have the added stress of being a public figure			2
both @entity169 and @entity170 have weathered similar storms with men they devoted their lives to			0
and one could argue that it is a lose / lose situation for any wife who finds herself in that position : if you stay , people judge you for not standing up for yourself , and if you leave there is endless speculation about why your marriage failed			2
but this is n't just a simple case of being cheated on			0
there are some very serious stories coming to the forefront from those who describe @entity3 as a sexual predator , who for decades allegedly drugged and violated young women who looked up to him as a mentor			1
during one of @entity3 's old routines , he actually jokes about drugging young women			1
coincidentally the set is from his album " it 's true ! it 's true ! " which was released in 1969 , the same year @entity201 claims he drugged and raped her			2
we can only speculate on what @entity1 's reasons are for staying in her marriage , when she found out about each rape claim , or whether she believes in her husband 's innocence			1
she 's been stoic and tight - lipped through all this , exuding the unflappable composure that she is known for			1
during the @entity212 , many believed that had @entity169 left her husband , his political career would have collapsed			0
@entity169 may have well understood that her marriage was n't just a union between a man and a woman but a much larger political machine			0
perhaps @entity19 , who is equally responsible for her husband 's career , feels a similar responsibility to maintaining the legacy and philanthropic institution she and her husband have built together			1
few knew that in the original " @entity226 " pitch , @entity3 had planned to have @entity227 be a limousine driver who was married to a @entity229 handywoman			1
programming executives were n't too thrilled with that idea , but it was @entity1 who convinced her husband to go in another direction			1
according to another excerpt in @entity97 's book : " the producers felt strongly that both [ parents on the show ] should be college graduates			1
as @entity3 had proved in his stand - up act , the war of wits between parents and children was even funnier if the parents thought of themselves as highly intelligent people			1
" finally , shortly before 1 in the morning , @entity3 said the words that made @entity248 think that she might be getting someplace : ' i think my wife would agree with you			1
' " ' you will not be a chauffeur ! ' @entity1 said when he briefed her on the meeting			1
' why not ? ' @entity3 asked			1
' because i 'm not going to be a carpenter ! ' @entity1 said			2
" that snippet gives a rare glimpse into the type of bond these two have , and also illustrates that mrs. @entity19 has not just been her husband 's muse , but also a trusted adviser who keeps his career on track , behind the scenes			1
sunday when @entity269 host @entity268 asked @entity3 about the resurfaced rape charges , he was met with a wall of silence			1
later on , @entity268 admitted to @entity0 that during that awkward moment in the interview , the one thing he could n't do was look at @entity1			2
" i did not look at mrs. @entity19 , and i do n't mind saying i might 've been a little uncomfortable doing that anyway , " @entity268 said			2
that 's what many find so unsettling about all this : the deafening silence of it all			0
the same man who has spent years waxing poetic about every social issue under the sun has now fallen completely mute on us , with his equally reticent wife by his side			0
the @entity289 ' union remains seemingly stable through half a century of life 's ups and downs , and as someone who respects the institution of marriage i find that commendable			0
but when does the adage of " stand by your man " go too far ? i 'm rooting for black love as much as the next person -- but not like this			0
from @entity111 : dr. @entity18 no more , @entity3 lost that persona after 13 rape allegations join us on @entity308 / @entity307 .			1
