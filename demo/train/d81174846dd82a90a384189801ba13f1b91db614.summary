@entity0 -- a long way from the big - spending , flag - waving spectacle of competing @entity7 presidential campaigns , a momentous leadership change is quietly unfolding in the world 's second largest economy			1
in november , thousands of specially chosen members of @entity12 's @entity11 will converge on @entity13 for the 18th @entity14			1
there , they 'll announce who 'll fill the soon - to - be - vacant roles of president , vice president , premier and assorted chiefs of important government departments			2
ahead of the congress , @entity1 's @entity24 sat down with three prominent @entity12 watchers -- @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 -- to discuss the leadership change and their views on the fate of the country and its ruling @entity11			1
we preview some of the key issues in the discussion			0
on @entity12 : full show times @entity24 : there seems to be factions at the top , or a lot of discussions about factions at the top , of the @entity11			1
you have the @entity48 faction , the @entity49 faction			0
is that overstated or is this the reality ? @entity27 : many people from outside @entity12 tend to look at the @entity11 of @entity12 as a monolithic group of people			1
but in reality , it is not			0
first of all , personalities do matter			0
secondly , these so - called political camps do exist			0
you have these people in higher positions , which belong to different traditions			0
you have different mentors , you have different associations			0
so this is what we call intra-party democracy in @entity12			1
@entity68 : i think its true there is diversity within @entity73 , but it is not the party 's intention to make it transparent to people who are not in the party or to anyone who is not part of the very political elite			2
if there is conflict , the first reaction of the party tends to be " close the doors , shut it off , do n't let the public see it			0
" so that 's why its public image seems to be secretive , and a bit closed off and monolithic , but there is dissension within the party for sure			2
@entity29 : so much of this stuff is based on guess work , because of the lack of transparency about the internal functions of @entity12			1
but you 'll see it ; these struggles manifest themselves in policy statements			0
and that 's done actually relatively publicly			2
do you live in @entity12 ? share your stories of daily life with @entity1 @entity24 : so your thoughts on presumptive leader @entity110 -- a so - called princeling , or son of a revolutionary leader			1
how was he able to rise to the top ? and how will he fare as @entity12 's next president ? @entity27 : he had a very unique career path ( with ) experience in four provinces and cities -- @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , and @entity123 -- in addition to his very unique and extraordinary experience at the @entity126			1
in addition to that , when he was in a civilian position , @entity110 kept his associations with the @entity12 military through various ways : serving in the reserve forces , taking up leadership of the provincial garrison , for example			1
so that sets him apart from almost all the current civilian leaders in @entity12			1
@entity68 : i think him having the pedigree is actually a plus ; that gives him a lot more leeway in terms of bringing about changes			0
but nobody knows whether he sees it that way or whether he will take the step , and whether politics will allow him to do it			0
i mean , there are just too many things in the balance			0
but what he 's stepping into is a historical period , which actually make changes possible			2
@entity29 : clearly he has a strong personality , much stronger than the previous leadership			2
how he uses that personality to his benefit or to @entity12 's benefit , i think it 's an open question			1
read more : @entity12 's next leaders -- who 's who @entity24 : what do @entity12 -- especially young @entity12 -- want ? is it freedom , democracy , political reform , or apartment , car and economic stability ? @entity68 : i think they want both ...			1
they do expect change for the better , more liberal , better reforms in the political system			0
but they are not basically saying we have to have certain elements that are modeled after a particular @entity187 government			0
@entity24 : so there is this expectation for change ... what does that mean for the @entity11 of @entity12 ? will it stay in power ? what is its fate ? @entity27 : i think that the @entity11 of @entity12 will remain the ruling party for many years , if not for many decades , to come			1
however , that does n't mean that there will be no increasing amount of democracy or democratic participation			0
i think participation in the government , monitoring of the government , supervision of the @entity11 by other democratic parties and by the population in general will increase			2
it may not be the same as in the @entity7 or in @entity214 or in @entity216 countries etc. , it will be very much of @entity12 characteristic , and that will set @entity12 apart from other developed countries for decades to come			2
@entity68 : i think the @entity11 will also continue to be the ruling party , but i think it needs to hear the people , and hear what they are saying , what they need and meet some of their demands , in order to do that			1
@entity29 : i generally agree , but i also think that from 1949 when @entity12 had its revolution until today , the @entity11 has actually been the main source of instability in @entity12 , and that when the party changes direction it causes enormous suffering in this country			1
so if we see significant fractures in that top echelon ( of the party ) , i think all bets are off			0
if they do not remain united , they 're going to sink together			0
if they are united in terms of pushing @entity12 forward and listening to the increasing demands of their people , or some type of political opening , they will be in charge for decades to come .			2
