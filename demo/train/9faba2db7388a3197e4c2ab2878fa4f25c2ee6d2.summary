@entity0 -- secretary of state @entity2 reached an important milestone wednesday in her quest to pay the debt from her failed 2008 presidential bid : for the first time in eight months , her campaign committee reported having more money in the bank than it owes			1
secretary of state @entity2 's campaign committee reported owing $ 2.3 million in debt at the end of march			1
on a day most @entity16 were preoccupied with filing their federal income taxes , @entity15 's campaign committee filed finance documents with the @entity19 , reporting a total of $ 2.3 million in debts at the end of march , compared with $ 2.6 million in the bank			1
the nation 's top diplomat has been steadily chipping away at unpaid campaign bills since suspending her @entity27 bid in june 2008 , when her debt peaked at $ 25.2 million			1
that amount covered $ 12 million owed to vendors , as well as the $ 13.2 million she loaned her campaign from personal funds			2
@entity15 's campaign was unable to repay that personal loan by the time the @entity36 convened in @entity37 , @entity38 , last august , the deadline mandated by the 2002 @entity41 campaign finance law			2
the former @entity43 senator was forced to forgive the entire loan amount			0
her campaign owed $ 6.4 million to 16 creditors at the end of november ; $ 5.9 million to five creditors at the end of december ; and the current $ 2.3 million owed to just one creditor at the end of march			1
that creditor is @entity51 , a political consulting and polling firm that advised @entity15 during her presidential bid			1
the firm 's president , @entity56 , was @entity15 's senior campaign strategist until he stepped down last april amid revelations that he had lobbied on behalf of @entity59 for a @entity16 - @entity59 trade deal that @entity15 opposed			2
@entity56 remained involved with the campaign			0
earlier this year , @entity15 and her supporters raced to pay as much of the debt as possible by the time she was confirmed and sworn in as the nation 's 67th secretary of state on january 21			2
as of that date , @entity15 became subject to a federal law known as the @entity70 , which prohibits federal employees from personally soliciting or accepting political contributions			0
the @entity70 allows others to keep raising money on @entity15 's behalf , without her direct involvement			0
this week , longtime @entity15 ally @entity78 , a @entity1 contributor , sent a fundraising e-mail to @entity81 on behalf of @entity15 's campaign , requesting contributions of as little as $ 5 in exchange for a chance to win one of several prizes , including spending a day with former president @entity15			1
" i wo n't spend a lot of time trying to convince you to help @entity2 , " @entity78 e-mailed			1
" i know what she means to you , and i 'm sure you know how important it is for her to have her campaign pay off all its obligations			0
" it 's unclear whether the campaign will use the $ 2.6 million in the bank to clear its $ 2.3 million in debts in the short term			1
continued fundraising indicates that it will not			0
additional operating expenses and other outlays could emerge			0
any extra money from the campaign could be donated to political causes or returned to donors			0
@entity15 's campaign reported raising $ 938,000 in contributions in the first three months of 2009			1
in addition to tapping traditional fundraising , the campaign also generated money by selling or renting various campaign assets to other organizations			0
it received $ 2.6 million from @entity15 's " @entity123 " @entity120 campaign committee for the sale of unspecified assets and an additional $ 2.2 million from renting out its lists of campaign supporters			1
organizations that have rented @entity15 's lists include the @entity129 , the inaugural committee of then - president - elect @entity131 , and the @entity132			0
those organizations each paid $ 274,297			0
@entity15 's political action committee , @entity133 , rented the lists for $ 822,492			2
among the @entity36 candidates who have rented @entity15 's campaign lists are @entity138 sen. @entity137 ; @entity140 gubernatorial candidate and former @entity15 campaign chairman @entity141 ; @entity43 sen. @entity142 , who was appointed to fill @entity15 's seat ; and @entity43 congressional candidate @entity144 , who hopes to succeed @entity142 in the @entity145 .			0
