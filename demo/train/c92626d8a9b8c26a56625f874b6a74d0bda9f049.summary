-- on sunday , there was a rally in @entity3 to protest something i never thought would need protesting in modern @entity6 : the rise of @entity8			2
the rally was in reaction to a series of strange , unsettling incidents that took place during the recent demonstrations against @entity15 military actions in @entity16			1
in one case , the manager of a supermarket in @entity3 decided to take all the kosher food off the shelves			2
he apparently feared that demonstrators outside might trash the shop ; one member of the staff reportedly said , " we support free @entity16			1
" the supermarket chain called it " an isolated decision ... in a very challenging situation			2
" isolated it may have been , but it is part of a bigger picture			2
there have always been people in the @entity34 who disagree with aspects of @entity15 foreign policy and there has always been a peace movement ready to protest @entity15 's actions			1
but what has made the 2014 protests different is the growing conflation of @entity15 in particular with @entity43 in general			1
not all kosher food comes from @entity15 , not all jews who eat it agree with the assault on @entity16			1
yet such an important distinction between state and racial identity has begun to erode			2
the result : a return of low - level anti-semitism to public life			2
of course , some of it has never gone away			0
just two years after the end of the @entity59 , there were anti-semitic riots across @entity6			0
@entity61 has an insidious history of @entity64 denial , and even a multicultural haven like @entity66 has seen racial tensions flare			0
but in 2014 , @entity8 went global all at once			0
in july , an anti-israeli demonstration in @entity69 broke into racist rioting : @entity43 - owned shops and synagogues were targeted			1
in @entity74 , they were chanting : " jew , @entity43 , cowardly pig , come out and fight alone			1
" in @entity66 , just last week , a @entity43 couple were roughed up by thugs waving @entity79 flags , according to the @entity80			1
in my native @entity6 , anti-semitic attacks have risen and we 've seen the return of old prejudices on anti-war marches			0
it 's important to stress that these are -- like the kosher food disappearance -- " isolated " incidents that do not indict everyone in the peace movement			2
but they are making @entity43 communities which once felt safe suddenly feel threatened			1
emigration to @entity15 by @entity96 @entity43 jumped 70 % in 2013 and will likely be even higher this year			1
at the beginning of the @entity16 operation , @entity98 columnist @entity97 wrote in @entity101 that he was uncomfortable with @entity15 's policies			1
one month later , after the protests , he wrote in the @entity98 that he felt " uncomfortable to be a jew			0
" there is a creeping sense of sickness in all of this			0
like a virus that starts with an itch in the back of your throat -- that you suspect could be something dormant about to break through			0
part of the reason is genuine , understandable anger at what has happened in @entity16			1
but while that might explain fury at the @entity15 state , it does not explain attacks on @entity43 overseas			1
after all , a state does not speak for all its citizens , let alone its ethnic diaspora			0
in @entity129 newspaper , one @entity43 @entity127 wrote , " @entity43 students get anti-zionist hate mail when @entity15 responds to rocket attacks by @entity133			1
the loudest part of supporters of @entity136 has lost all sense and gives all the guilt to anyone who wears a skullcap or a @entity141			0
" he added : " for jews , the danger comes not long only from the right			2
" that is a big part of the problem			0
anti-semitism has historically been associated with the far right , parties of which have capitalized upon the @entity151 and done well in recent @entity61 elections			2
the recession has drawn some back into narrow - minded nationalism , and even the blood and soil politics of the 1930s			0
the most striking examples of this are the virulently racist @entity161 movement in @entity162 or the more subtly racist @entity163 in @entity96			0
but @entity8 has also been allowed , even invited , to enter the left , too			2
the peace movement has been reinvigorated by @entity167 immigration to @entity61 , and aspects of the left have made alliances with people who make spurious claims to be @entity167 community leaders			2
in reality , those leaders do not speak for the vast , vast majority of muslims who understand the distinction between @entity15 policy and @entity43			1
but the influence of this particular brand of @entity183 extremism is being felt on the marches -- as the @entity69 riots attest			0
at the same time , left - wing critics of @entity188 foreign policy have often flirted with the notion that there is an unholy alliance of @entity192 and @entity15 making all the decisions			1
or even that @entity15 is in fact directing what the @entity192 does through a conspiracy of lobbyists , capital and media			1
i encountered this firsthand when i did a tv debate with a leader of the @entity204 in @entity3 last week			0
i was told that the @entity34 was only supporting the @entity205 against @entity206 in northern @entity207 because of @entity192 and @entity15 oil interests			1
i could think of no more fitting response			0
that experience caps several years of noticing a quiet perversion of peace movement politics taking place			0
on a personal note , i am anti-interventionist ( borderline pacifist ) and happily marched with the @entity204 against the @entity216 in 2003			0
but when working as a lecturer a few years later , i quit my labor union when it signed on to a boycott of @entity15 academics			1
and i 've witnessed a strange slide within the anti-war movement toward a variety of politics that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth			0
obviously , i 'm concerned about a rise of a socially acceptable anti-semitism that threatens the well - being of those @entity43 friends that i know and love			1
but i also despair that the @entity61 peace movement has allowed this situation to develop without stopping even to think about it			0
the tolerance that some on the left are showing toward anti-semitism threatens to delegitimize fair and reasonable criticism of @entity15 policy			1
they have allowed a potentially noble cause to be infiltrated by people without a shred of nobility			0
they need to put their house in order before it collapses down on all of us .			0

@entity251 : anti-semitism surfaced in the wake of the *controversy* over @entity16 war
he says some conflate @entity15 and its policies with @entity43 in general
it 's vital to ensure that historic prejudice does *n't* get *revived* , he says
@entity251 : anti-semitism has long been connected to far right , but some on left tolerate it
