@entity1 's @entity0 has pulled off a sort of political magic trick , in that warring sides can read the bill 's text and have not only different reactions , but completely opposite ones			1
while proponents of gay rights dub the bill oppressive , those in favor of the bill becoming law say it represents freedom			1
freedom vs. oppression : that 's the polar contrast gov. @entity21 must consider as she sits down to " listen to both sides " this week ahead of her decision whether to sign or veto the bill that has divided her state and drawn national and commercial interests into the fray			1
@entity27 has until saturday to make her call , and her fellow @entity29 in the state legislature have suggested that a veto is likely			1
in short , @entity0 would amend the existing @entity32 , allowing business owners to deny service to gay and lesbian customers so long as proprietors were acting solely on their religious beliefs			0
the bill 's advocates insist that those claiming @entity42 amounts to bigotry and discrimination have hijacked and misrepresented its aims			1
what 's your take on the issue ? " the attacks on @entity0 show politics at its absolute worse			2
they represent precisely why so many people are sick of the modern political debate			2
instead of having an honest discussion about the true meaning of religious liberty , opponents of the bill have hijacked this discussion through lies , personal attacks , and irresponsible reporting , " said @entity54 , president of the @entity54 , which lent a hand in scribing the bill			1
@entity67 , an attorney for the @entity68 , which also helped craft the bill , called @entity0 a " balancing test " that would protect all religions and sexual orientations while prohibiting @entity72 from " coercing someone to violate their sincerely held beliefs			2
" " this bill has nothing to do with discrimination			0
it 's protecting basic freedoms that belong to everyone , " she said , explaining that it would protect a gay photographer 's decision not to work for @entity85 , or @entity86 who do n't want to sell " pork sandwiches on a saturday			1
" @entity27 has a history a dreadnought of the conservative cause , @entity27 rarely shies from controversy and , often in the face of staunch political and economic backlash , has boldly defended her stances on the economy , gun rights , regulation , taxation , immigration and even wagging her finger in the face of president @entity104			0
" i do n't rely a whole lot on my gut because i have to look at what ( the bill ) says and what the law says and take that information and do the right thing , " she said from the @entity107 's winter meeting in @entity108			1
" i will do the right thing for the state of @entity1			1
" but since thursday , when the state @entity119 ok 'd the bill by a 33 - 27 margin and sent it to @entity27 's desk , what 's right for @entity1 has become somewhat amorphous			1
already , three @entity29 senators who voted in favor of @entity0 , including a co-sponsor , sen. @entity126 , have changed their minds			1
the bill passed the state @entity129 17 - 13 with the " yea " votes of the three senators			0
" while our sincere intent in voting for the bill was to create a shield for all citizens ' religious liberties , the bill has instead been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword for religious intolerance			0
these allegations are causing our state immeasurable harm , " @entity126 and sens. @entity141 and @entity142 said in a letter sent to @entity27 on monday			0
" as @entity1 leaders we feel it is important to loudly proclaim that we strongly condemn discrimination in any form , " the letter said			2
backlash bubbles up the @entity152 , which has scheduled @entity153 for the @entity155 suburb of @entity156 next year , has a like stance , and league spokesman @entity158 issued a monday statement to that effect , saying , " we are following the issue in @entity1 and will continue to do so should the bill be signed into law , but will decline further comment at this time			1
" the state 's own @entity165 was more blunt in its statement , which said it strives to promote " economic vitality " and " adoption of this legislation would not only run contrary to that goal but deal a significant blow to the state 's economic growth potential			2
we do not support this legislation			0
" a few @entity177 companies concur , as @entity178 warned @entity27 in a letter that the legislation " would have profound negative impacts on the hospitality industry , " and @entity184 ceo @entity183 told the governor that signing the bill " would jeopardize all that has been accomplished so far			1
" @entity188 , which is building a glass plant in @entity190 that 's slated to create hundreds of jobs , said monday that it , too , was urging @entity27 to veto @entity42			1
the state @entity192 and @entity194 have come out against the bill as well , and local businesses in @entity196 and @entity155 have also taken strong stances			0
@entity198 of @entity199 has printed off dozens of signs saying " open for business to everyone , " which he 's giving away to businesses			0
in @entity196 , @entity206 's @entity205 took to its @entity208 page to post a photo of a sign reading , " we reserve the right to refuse service to @entity1 legislators			1
" but while opposition to the bill has been loud -- and has included the condemnations of @entity218 and @entity219 , the state 's @entity29 @entity221 senators -- there are those who say the bill is vital in a nation that has increasingly turned hostile toward religion			1
whom does it protect ? said the @entity54 's @entity54 , " simply put , the fear - mongering from opponents is unrelated to the language of the bill , and proves that hostility towards people of faith is very real			2
it 's a shame we even need a bill like this in @entity221			2
but growing hostility against freedom in our nation , and the increasing use of government to threaten and punish its own citizens , has made it necessary			0
" state sen. @entity246 , a hopeful to succeed @entity27 , told @entity248 's @entity247 that @entity1 was a " people friendly " state and that @entity0 was merely a " pre-emptive " measure that would prevent attacks on religion in the future			1
" all of the pillars of society are under attack in the @entity221 : the family , the traditional family , traditional marriage , mainline churches , the @entity261 , you name it , " he said			0
asked if he could cite specific examples of attacks on @entity72 ' freedom of religion , @entity246 replied , " not now , no , but what about tomorrow ? " pressed further about whether the bill could be used to deny service to divorcees or unwed mothers on religious grounds , he scoffed			0
" i think you 're being farfetched , " he told @entity247			0
" who would discriminate against them ? i 've never heard of discrimination against people like that			0
... i do n't know of anybody in @entity1 that would discriminate against a fellow human being			2
" @entity1 constitutionally outlawed same - sex marriages in 2008 , and legal experts say nothing in present @entity1 law would prevent a business owner from discriminating against gays and lesbians , making @entity0 unnecessary			1
@entity27 alluded to these provisions in an interview after @entity42 was passed last week			2
" i think anybody that owns a business can choose who they work with or who they do n't work with , " she said			0
while @entity72 on both sides of the issue , as well as the nation at large , keep keen eyes on @entity155 as @entity27 ponders her decision , the governor has hinted that the issue , for her , may come down to whether the ban or protection of freedom -- depending on how you view it -- needs to be enshrined in state law			0
" i do n't know that it needs to be statutory			0
in my life and in my businesses , if i do n't want to do business or if i do n't want to deal with a particular company or person or whatever , i 'm not interested			0

gov. @entity21 to decide by saturday whether to sign @entity42 into law
