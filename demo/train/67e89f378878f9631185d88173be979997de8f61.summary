-- killing the man proved easier than killing his ideology			1
following a decade - long hunt , @entity3 was finally run to ground in @entity5 two years ago			2
@entity3 did not die on the bloody battlefield of a holy war but in a suburban compound in the comfortable city of @entity10 in northern @entity5 , surrounded by three of his wives and a dozen of his children and grandchildren			2
the anti-heroic death of the @entity19 leader was greeted by only small protests in the @entity22 world			2
and worries that @entity3 's " martyrdom " would unleash a new wave of terrorist attacks have proved unfounded			1
at the time of @entity3 's death on may 1 , 2011 , core @entity19 had already been severely degraded by @entity31 drone strikes			1
drones have killed at least 30 leaders of @entity19 in @entity5 , according to a count by the @entity35			0
some of the most senior @entity19 leaders had also been arrested in @entity5			0
as @entity39 , who headed @entity31 operations against @entity19 in the years after 9/11 , puts it in the @entity42 documentary " @entity43 " : " congratulations , @entity45 , you 're now the no. 3 in @entity19 ; that 's the good news			0
the bad news is , you 're now the no. 3 in @entity19			0
buckle your chinstrap , because your career path is probably going to be short - lived			0
" as a result of @entity31 operations , the @entity19 core is now on life support			0
simultaneously , @entity3 's overall strategy has failed			1
instead of forcing the @entity55 to pull out of the @entity56 as @entity3 had predicted would happen after the 9/11 attacks , the @entity55 , together with its allies , largely destroyed @entity19 in @entity60 and later invaded @entity61 while building up massive @entity55 military bases in @entity22 countries such as @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
@entity67 : agencies often miss warning signs of attacks if @entity3 's strategy of attacking the @entity55 was a failure , his ideas , unfortunately , may have more lasting currency , at least among a small minority in the @entity22 world			1
like many of history 's most effective leaders , @entity3 told a simple story about the world that his followers around the globe found easy to grasp			1
in his telling , there was a conspiracy by the @entity87 and its puppet allies in the @entity22 world to destroy true @entity89 , a conspiracy led by the @entity55			1
as a result of this purported conspiracy , violence against the @entity55 was a necessity			2
@entity3 's single narrative of a war on @entity89 by the @entity87 also purports to explain all the problems of the @entity22 world : for example , that the long - running war between @entity99 and the @entity100 is not a centuries - old imperialist land grab by the @entity99 but is rather a @entity104 war against @entity89			1
so , too , are the @entity55 - led wars in @entity60 and @entity61 , which @entity106 has told investigators were among the reasons he and his brother carried out the bombings that targeted the @entity111 , according to a @entity55 government official who briefed @entity0			0
@entity19 , the organization that @entity3 created during the late 1980s , has now morphed into a loose jihadist ideological movement			0
that movement spawned the most spectacular terrorist attacks in the @entity55 since 9/11 in the form of the @entity106 brothers , who authorities said killed four and injured some 250 others during the course of a five - day killing spree in @entity122 this month			1
this is @entity3 's most toxic legacy : " @entity124			1
" it is an ideological movement that is supported by an entire jihadist ecosystem in which the @entity106 brothers and other militants can easily swim			0
@entity67 : who really killed @entity3 ? the widely available @entity131 webzine inspire is produced by @entity19 's @entity133 affiliate and teaches recruits in the @entity87 how to build bombs			1
password - protected jihadist forums allow militants to " meet " electronically and clandestinely			0
@entity139 clerics preach hate in colloquial @entity131 on the @entity141 , and shadowy overseas militant groups allied to @entity19 or influenced by its ideology have recruited and trained many thousands of militants during the past decade , including dozens of @entity55			2
the most effective of these militant groups today is the @entity145 in @entity146 , which is essentially a rebranded franchise of @entity19 's @entity61 affiliate			2
@entity148 is the most effective force fighting the @entity151 regime and is widely regarded as the most disciplined of the hundreds of opposition groups now fighting in @entity146			0
@entity148 seems to have learned from the mistakes of @entity19 in @entity61 , which wantonly killed fellow @entity22 and imposed @entity155 - style rule on @entity61 's @entity157 population , provoking a tribal rebellion against @entity19 known as the @entity159 that began in 2006 and devastated @entity19 in @entity61			2
@entity148 is avoiding these kinds of mistakes and is actually providing services in a systematic way to the populated area it controls , something of a first for an @entity19 affiliate			0
@entity148 makes large quantities of much - needed bread for the desperate @entity146 population and even controls some of @entity146 's oil fields			2
in the documents that were picked up by the @entity174 seal team that raided @entity3 's compound in @entity10 are many examples of @entity3 and other @entity19 leaders urging fellow militants to avoid causing @entity22 civilian casualties and to learn from the mistakes of @entity19 in @entity61			1
in @entity146 , these lessons , for the moment , seem to be being heeded , while the tragedy in @entity122 shows that the death of @entity3 did not lead to the death of his ideas			1
@entity67 : should we still fear @entity19 ? this is underlined by a poll conducted by the @entity190 in spring 2012 , a year after @entity3 was killed , finding that in @entity5 , 13 % of @entity22 held a favorable view of @entity19			1
in @entity192 , 15 % expressed a positive opinion , and the group received its highest ratings in @entity196 , where 21 % held a favorable view			0
these favorable numbers are , of course , far outweighed by the unfavorable views that @entity19 enjoys in the same countries			0
for most @entity22 , whatever fleeting attraction @entity19 's ideology may once have enjoyed has largely evaporated , in particular because @entity19 and it allies have killed so many @entity22 civilians around the @entity89 world			1
but @entity124 continues to excite a small but not insignificant minority of @entity22			0
we will be living with this ideology for many years to come until it is finally consigned to " history 's unmarked grave of discarded lies , " as president @entity215 eloquently put it in a speech to @entity218 10 days after 9/11 .			0

@entity220 : it was easier for the @entity55 to kill @entity3 than to kill his ideology
the @entity122 bombing is one case in which @entity3 's ideology may have played a role , he says
the *majority* of @entity22 *reject* @entity230 , but there are still some *adherents* , he says
@entity67 : @entity146 conflict is another arena in which @entity230 is active
