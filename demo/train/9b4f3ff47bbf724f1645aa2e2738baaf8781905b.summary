@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 leader @entity6 's momentum has stopped and rebels have been able to hold onto areas that government forces had been poised to capture just a few days ago , a @entity4 official said monday			1
@entity6 has declared a cease - fire , the official said , and the coalition is watching carefully to see if that declaration " is a pledge or just words			1
" an opposition spokesman said monday there is no cease - fire , at least not in @entity19 , a key city about two hours east of @entity0			1
the spokesman , @entity20 -- who would not divulge his last name out of concern for his safety -- said the destruction there is " unimaginable " and that @entity19 was bombarded heavily over the past four days by forces loyal to @entity6			1
" he keeps talking about a cease - fire , but he has n't observed that for one minute here , " @entity20 said			1
based on what he saw at a hospital , @entity20 said monday 's death toll among civilians at the hands of @entity35 forces was 15			2
another 51 civilians died in weekend attacks by @entity35 forces , @entity20 said			0
late monday , state television reported that @entity19 was firmly in the hands of government forces , and it urged residents to celebrate			1
the head of @entity4 forces in @entity1 told reporters that coalition forces had made " very effective " progress monday toward their goal of enforcing a @entity49 resolution intended to protect civilians from attack by forces loyal to @entity6			1
" i assess that our actions to date are generally achieving the intended objectives , " said gen. @entity52 , commander of @entity53			2
" we think we have been very effective in degrading his ability to control his regime forces			2
" no @entity1 aircraft has been observed operating since the military operations began over the weekend , he said			0
in addition , air attacks have stopped @entity1 ground forces from approaching the eastern rebel stronghold of @entity66 , and some are even turning back from the city , he said			0
during the prior 24 hours , he said , @entity4 and @entity70 forces launched 12 @entity72 land attack missiles aimed at command - and - control facilities , a @entity75 surface - to - surface military facility and , in a repeat attack , an air defense site			1
approximately 80 sorties were flown monday , more than half of them by air forces representing countries other than the @entity4 , he said			0
air forces from @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity70 flew missions to maintain a no - fly zone over @entity66 , @entity52 said			0
actions on monday were focused on extending the no - fly zone to @entity90 , @entity19 and then to @entity0 , a distance of about 1,000 kilometers ( more than 600 miles )			1
@entity93 and @entity94 forces joined coalition forces monday , he said , and aircraft carriers from @entity85 and @entity83 have added " significant capability " in the region			2
the coalition is also deciding who should be in charge of its military operations , @entity52 said			1
@entity103 could command the mission , but some @entity106 nations are hesitant to fly under a @entity103 banner and that has held up the move , said one official who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of negotiations			2
if @entity106 nations do n't sign on to a @entity103 mission , the other option would be to create an ad hoc command - and - control structure piece by piece , the defense official said -- but that would take time			1
@entity6 's compound in @entity0 lay in shambles monday after an attack by the @entity4 and its allies			1
@entity52 said the compound contains a command - and - control facility , which he said coalition forces attacked			1
@entity6 himself has not been targeted and there are no plans to do so , @entity52 added			1
in fact , he said , " i could see accomplishing the military mission , which has been assigned to me , and the current leader would remain the current leader			1
" @entity52 continued , " i do n't think anyone would say that that is ideal			0
but i could envision that as a possible situation , at least for the current mission that i have			0
" @entity4 president @entity140 repeated monday that @entity6 " needs to go , " but he acknowledged the strongman may remain in power for some time because the allied military mission in @entity144 has a narrow mandate of protecting innocent civilians			1
@entity140 said he 's hopeful that other " tools " the administration has used , such as freezing billions in @entity1 assets , will eventually help the @entity1 people push @entity6 out			2
a press and information coordinator for rebels in @entity66 said rebel leaders do not want coalition forces to target @entity6			1
that , said @entity157 , is the job of the opposition			0
he added the opposition has compiled a list of names of @entity6 loyalists and imprisoned 150 of them in @entity66 for them eventually to stand trial			2
some of them , he said , had carried out attacks against their fellow @entity66 residents or were planning to			0
@entity1 's request for an emergency @entity49 meeting about the matter was not approved monday			0
the @entity49 resolution , which passed thursday , allows member states " to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country ... while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of @entity1 territory			0
" support for the attacks was not universal			0
the @entity188 government said the mission has killed innocent civilians and urged more caution , and @entity192 , @entity193 , and @entity194 have also spoken out against the airstrikes			0
@entity49 @entity196 ban ki - moon -- who met saturday with @entity197 and other world leaders to discuss @entity1 -- said support from @entity106 leaders was key to the @entity49 's decision			0
@entity202 secretary - general @entity197 told @entity2 monday that the league 's vote on march 12 to support a no - fly zone does not mean that all @entity106 countries will participate			2
@entity207 , @entity208 's foreign minister , has said @entity202 members agreed to support the no - fly zone despite reservations about military intervention			2
the @entity1 government has said that 48 people , mostly women , children and clerics , have died in allied attacks			0
@entity4 vice admiral @entity217 , however , said there is no indication of any civilian casualties			0
@entity83 -- which conducted the first strike in @entity1 on saturday when fighter jets fired at a military vehicle -- also disputed claims of civilian deaths			0
@entity2 's @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 and journalist @entity239 contributed to this report			0
