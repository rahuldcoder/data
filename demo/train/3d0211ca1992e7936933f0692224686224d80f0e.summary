-- for sale : one million barrels of crude oil			1
currently sitting off @entity5 coast			0
that 's what the @entity8 @entity7 are offering potential buyers , much to the fury of the government in @entity13			1
it amounts to a declaration of economic independence , fraying the already tattered ties holding @entity8 together			2
here 's how it works : the @entity19 , or @entity19 , deals with oil exploration companies independent of the central government			1
@entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 are among the companies working in @entity26			0
the crude produced there goes through a pipeline to the @entity31 port of @entity32 in the @entity33			0
then it 's loaded onto tankers and floats about until it finds a buyer			0
the proceeds are held in a @entity31 bank ; the @entity7 say they will take 17 % and the @entity8 government is entitled to the rest			1
who are the @entity8 @entity7 ? along with the @entity44 and the @entity45 , the @entity7 are one of the three dominant groups in the fractious and diverse nation of @entity8			2
while most @entity7 are @entity45 and a minority are @entity44 , they identify first as an ethnic group			0
they are distinct from @entity50 and speak an @entity52 language			0
the @entity19 population numbers 15 % to 20 % of @entity8 , which has a population of 32,585,000 , according to an estimate from the @entity57			1
there are also large @entity19 populations in the neighboring countries of @entity52 , @entity61 and @entity31 , with varying levels of independence aspirations			2
the @entity19 rules an autonomous region with its own cabinet , parliament , president and military forces			1
the region consists of three provinces in @entity8 's north : @entity72 , @entity73 , and @entity74			1
the @entity7 had been oppressed by @entity8 's @entity76 government , but the area has avoided much of the country 's warfare since @entity76 's overthrow in 2003			1
today , @entity8 @entity26 is regarded as a relatively stable and economically booming @entity82 success story , thanks to its oil clout			1
scaling up the @entity19 began exporting small amounts of crude oil in trucks last year , but the pipeline to @entity32 gives it the opportunity to scale up			1
industry sources say more than 100,000 barrels are flowing through the pipeline every day , and more than 2 million barrels are already stored at @entity32			0
altogether , there may be the equivalent of 45 billion barrels of oil under @entity19 land in @entity8 , according to the @entity19			1
aligning with @entity99 the most recent buyer appears to be @entity99			0
late friday , the @entity101 docked at the port of @entity103 , having taken on a load of @entity19 crude from another tanker in the @entity33 a week ago			2
why @entity99 ? it 's not clear who the buyer is , or whether the oil changed hands once or more before finding its final destination			2
but the @entity99 may see the @entity7 as a natural ally in a region where both feel they are threatened minorities			0
problems offloading another much larger cargo -- said to contain 1 million barrels -- has been at sea for more than a month			0
according to shipping sources , the @entity122 tanker was at anchor off @entity125 in @entity5 late last week , still looking for a buyer			0
ship tracking databases had the vessel listed as " for orders , " meaning its cargo does not yet have a destination			0
see maps : where @entity133 has taken over in @entity8 the @entity122 's limbo suggests that despite reportedly offering big discounts for its crude , the @entity19 is having problems offloading it			1
some buyers are worried about @entity13 's threat to sue anyone who buys @entity8 oil other than through the state company			1
the @entity8 government has already blacklisted some agents and importers of @entity19 oil , including the @entity148 company @entity147			1
other buyers @entity150 reported earlier this month that @entity152 oil company @entity151 had bought a cargo of @entity19 crude for a refinery in @entity156 that it co-owns			1
forty one thousand tonnes of oil -- which had been trucked from @entity26 to @entity32 -- were carried by the @entity161 tanker to @entity162 in @entity163 and then sent by pipeline to @entity156 , the agency reported			0
@entity31 says it regards the sales and the use of a @entity31 port as legitimate , but also has political interests at stake in a complex regional picture			0
prime minister @entity171 has developed close ties with the @entity19 leadership in @entity8 -- partly to dissuade it from making common cause with @entity31 's restive @entity19 minority			1
@entity31 also wants to diversify its sources of energy			0
it concluded a 50 - year deal with the @entity19 this month ( though details of the agreement remain sketchy )			2
' playing with fire ' the @entity8 government has begun legal action against @entity185 at the @entity186			1
@entity8 deputy prime minister @entity187 warned @entity31 that it was " playing with fire " and " plundering @entity8 's wealth			1
" the @entity190 also opposes the @entity19 sales as a further destabilizing factor in a country at risk of breaking apart			1
producing or refining companies working in parts of @entity8 still under the control of the central government seem to be avoiding involvement with the @entity7 ' unilateral action			1
need for cash but the @entity19 needs cash -- lots of it and quickly -- because negotiations with @entity13 over the @entity7 ' share of oil revenues have stalled			1
it has also borrowed heavily			0
its monthly wage bill is more than $ 700 million -- that 's 70 % of the entire budget just going on salaries			0
and now that its peshmerga forces are fully mobilized in protecting @entity26 from the @entity213 in @entity8 and @entity61 , or @entity133 , that spending is likely to rise			2
according to a recent study by @entity215 , the @entity19 would need monthly sales from 20 tankers holding a million barrels of oil each to make $ 340 million			1
fraught with peril but @entity221 , senior research fellow at the @entity222 at the @entity223 in @entity224 , believes the sales are fraught with peril			0
" the key issue is transparency and risk - free exports , " she told @entity0			0
" if something is legitimate or legal -- as both the @entity7 and @entity31 claim -- why then does the sale of @entity19 crude remain shrouded in so much mystery and murkiness , with transfers at sea , and buyers and prices not being identified ? " " any sales that may eventually occur will still be considered illicit trading by @entity13 ; and that will entail litigation and brings with it reputational damage			2
" a price as the government of prime minister @entity247 in @entity13 tries to stave off advances by @entity133 , the @entity7 are in a strong bargaining position			0
their peshmerga forces have been able to repulse @entity133 attempts to infiltrate the @entity19 region -- and might yet help government forces go on the offensive			1
but there will be a price			0
above all , the @entity19 wants the major city of @entity258 -- which it now occupies and where @entity7 , @entity259 and @entity45 all live -- to be recognized as part of the @entity19 autonomous region			2
the @entity19 's president , @entity262 , told @entity0 's @entity263 on monday that @entity8 was " falling apart ... and it 's obvious that the federal or central government has lost control over everything			1
" " and we can not remain hostages of the unknown , " he added			0
@entity0 exclusive : " @entity271 is here for self - determination " a new confrontation ? @entity275 forces last week took control of the @entity258 oilfield , strengthening the @entity7 ' hold over @entity8 's northern oilfields			2
the @entity258 oilfield is @entity8 's fourth largest but badly in need of investment			2
but @entity221 , who has followed events in @entity8 for more than 20 years , says the @entity7 ' assertiveness may end up generating a new confrontation			0
" @entity262 does have leverage over the @entity247 government because it is so weak , and the @entity7 ' occupation of the @entity258 fields does strengthen their short - term bargaining position			0
but such weakness and politically expedient alliances may not last forever , " she says			0
" the @entity247 government may be replaced by a more inclusive and therefore stronger government in @entity13 , or a @entity45 @entity50 state may emerge on the @entity7 ' doorstep that may not be amenable to @entity19 demands			2
" relying on @entity31 the @entity7 are also very reliant on @entity31 's goodwill			0
" the @entity8 @entity7 are increasingly dependent on @entity31 as a conduit for their oil and financing , " @entity221 told @entity0 , " and the close relationship between @entity262 and @entity171 is largely responsible for the current arrangement			2
but some groups in the @entity31 parliament and some @entity8 @entity19 politicians have been very critical of this opaque arrangement , " wary of ruining relations with @entity13 and alienating @entity224			1
for now , the @entity31 and @entity19 governments appear to feel that the retaliation threatened by @entity13 can be ignored			0
@entity31 's @entity309 said last week it expected another shipment of @entity19 oil to leave @entity32 soon			1
according to a ship tracking database , that oil is aboard the 85,000 - tonne @entity315 - registered @entity314 , which left the port at the weekend -- destination unknown			0
where is @entity8 's oil ? @entity321 - born jihadists rally to @entity133 's fight in @entity8 and @entity61 @entity8 @entity19 leader : ' we are facing a new reality and a new @entity8 '			1

there may be the equivalent of 45 billion barrels of oil under @entity19 land
@entity190 opposes sales as a destabilizing factor
the @entity19 government needs cash quickly
@entity8 is " falling apart , " the region 's president says
