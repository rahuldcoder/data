for the first time since two people died in the terrifying sinking of the @entity4 in @entity5 , federal officials monday pointed fingers at what likely caused the disaster			1
bounty capt. @entity17 's " reckless decision to sail ... into the well - forecast path of @entity5 " was the probable cause of the tall ship 's october 2012 sinking off the coast of @entity14 , the @entity10 said in a report released monday			1
the ship , carrying 16 crew members , flipped sideways in heavy seas and high winds , spilling everyone into the @entity24			2
@entity17 , 63 , was never found and is presumed dead ; deckhand @entity25 -- a 42 - year - old rookie -- died after @entity27 rescuers were unable to revive her			1
the @entity10 report -- and a similar investigation report expected to be released by the @entity27 -- could lead to changes in rules governing how attraction vessels like the @entity4 are inspected for safety			1
before the ship left port in @entity37 , @entity38 , for @entity39 , @entity40 , the captain indicated he knew the hurricane was moving up the @entity42 , according to crew testimony at @entity27 hearings in 2013			1
heading into the storm 's path " subjected the aging vessel and the inexperienced crew to conditions from which the vessel could not recover , " monday 's @entity10 report said			1
ten of @entity4 's crew members had been aboard for less than a year -- including two who had joined less than a month before the sinking			1
" @entity4 's crew was put into an extraordinarily hazardous situation through decisions that by any measure did n't prioritize safety , " @entity10 chairman @entity55 said in a statement			1
the report said it 's " possible that the captain may have focused too narrowly on the position of the storm 's eye instead of on @entity5 's total expanse			2
" the storm was huge , spanning more than 1,000 miles in diameter			0
the " area into which the @entity4 was heading was already under tropical storm warnings , with conditions forecasted to worsen , " the report said			2
" still the captain seemed to believe that he could outrace the storm			0
" by the time the captain and crew realized the ship was sinking , the @entity76 was tossing in 30 - foot seas and being battered by 103 mph winds about 100 miles off @entity81			1
during the @entity27 hearings 14 surviving crew members testified			0
not one leveled any blame for the disaster at their shipmates or at @entity88			0
on monday , @entity4 survivor @entity89 told @entity6 on the phone that some of the report 's nuances rubbed her the wrong way			1
she said the report mistakenly paints the captain as disregarding the crew 's well being			1
" @entity17 thought a lot about safety , " said @entity89 , who almost drowned during the first few minutes after the ship flipped on its side			0
" but i agree that he also during his career had been walking this line of going out in big storms and making it			0
" they made it through the storms , despite @entity4 's less - than - perfect condition , @entity89 said , because @entity17 " was good -- and the crew was good			1
that boat lasted so long because he was so good			0
" when @entity4 crew member @entity111 spoke with @entity6 tuesday about the @entity10 report , he questioned the command decisions made during the ship 's the final hours			1
@entity111 said that as soon as @entity17 " figured out that the pumps were n't working right -- and that we would n't be able to get them started again -- we probably should have abandoned ship			0
" that was about four or five hours before the ship turned on its side , he said			2
related : a year after the sinking brings messages in a bottle the @entity4 was arguably the world 's most famous traditionally rigged replica ship			1
the three - masted square rigger appeared in several @entity129 films , including the " @entity131 " franchise			0
related : @entity132 on the @entity4 at @entity27 hearings , crew members testified that the @entity4 suffered from a reputation in the tall - ship community for shoddy maintenance and spotty training			1
" contributing to the sinking was the lack of effective safety oversight by the vessel organization , " monday 's report said			2
the report stated that , although the @entity4 took on water even in good conditions and wood rot had been discovered , the captain gave no order to ensure all onboard pumps were fully operational before departing			1
this , despite his knowledge that the ship was sure to encounter rough seas as it sailed closer to @entity5 , according to the report			2
" the vessel could have handled the storm , if everything on the ship had worked right , " @entity111 said			0
" the boat 's pumps did n't work right			0
" it 's a " possibility " that the ship 's owners and @entity17 bear some responsibility , he said			2
" they 're probably the ones who were supposed to keep after that			0
" @entity171 , a representative of the ship owner @entity173 , e-mailed @entity6 : " i am unable to comment on the report ( which we have not seen ) or the pending litigation			0
" @entity111 said he hoped the tragedy would bring to light the extreme difficulty he and his fellow survivors had trying to climb inside the @entity4 's life rafts after the ship sank			1
" i do n't know who makes those rafts , but they should redesign them , " he said			0
he also said immersion survival suits should be designed with cuffs around the neck openings to prevent them from filling with water			0
" if it fills with water , it 's impossible to pull yourself out of the ocean , " @entity111 said			0
for decades before the sinking , the @entity4 sailed as an attraction vessel -- moving from port to port and charging tourists admission to board it while it was docked			2
to charge admission for shipboard tours at dockside , the @entity4 required only a simple , brief @entity27 inspection that checked for obvious safety issues such as major leaks or malfunctioning emergency equipment			0
the @entity4 passed one of these about two months before the disaster			2
@entity211 's family has filed a civil lawsuit against the ship 's owner			1
the case is currently in settlement talks			0
@entity211 's parents are " not doing well at all , " the family 's attorney @entity217 told @entity6			2
" we now have one report â€” and when the next one comes down , that will help put some closure on this for them			0
