@entity0 , @entity1 -- at the start of a three - month reporting stint in @entity6 , i 'd thought vaguely to myself how i would n't mind climbing @entity0 when my assignment was done -- in the way that i 've always vaguely wondered about running a marathon , but never got round to it			1
@entity0 , after all , is a mountain close to the hearts of all @entity1 , an icon of this beautiful country ... and front cover of the @entity16 , which i had furnished myself with prior to departing @entity17 , my regular reporting base			1
then when my producer , @entity19 , told me that she 'd found coming down @entity0 worse than running a marathon , i thought to myself , " it 'll never happen			1
" one day on an early morning flight to @entity23 , @entity19 and i flew over @entity0 -- the most breathtaking view of the mountain i 've had , and the photo that 's got the most likes i 've ever had on @entity27			1
then a month ago i was sent to @entity28 and told i would n't be returning to @entity1 -- my dream of climbing @entity0 was relegated to wistful " it was never meant to be " status			1
but no. this saturday i have to be back home in the @entity32			0
it was always a hard " out date " from @entity34			1
and now the chance has arisen			0
we 'll be accompanying a team from @entity38 as they chart a route to the summit of the 3,776 - meter ( 12,388 - feet )			1
my colleague , @entity41 , was meant to do this last week but the weather was too bad so the trip was postponed			0
cultural gem the @entity47 team plans to map out a path up to the peak for the first time			2
@entity0 was recently granted @entity52 status -- though the @entity54 panel classified it as a " cultural " rather than " natural " heritage site because it had " inspired artists and poets and been the object of pilgrimage for centuries			1
" the plan was to leave the mountain at 6 p.m. local time on friday and depart on my flight to @entity64 the following morning			2
i banked on my frantic last - minute @entity65 ( high intensity interval training ) sessions -- courtesy of my @entity28 producer @entity70 -- to help me deal with my fitness so i could better cope with issues such as altitude sickness			0
but if 300,000 other people manage to climb @entity0 each year , then so could we			1
follow @entity76 on @entity77 too rather than a dose of nature , i readied myself for human traffic jams up towards the peak			0
it 's a heat - wave in @entity6 , the perfect time to escape			2
@entity0 , we 're ready for you ! perfect conditions the weather was perfect when the party set off			1
we were treated to some fantastic views as we traversed to 3,000 meters			0
at this point we had around 700 to go by the afternoon , so everyone prepared to climb into the evening			0
the only slightly troubling thing was that our companions from @entity38 -- our reason for being here -- seemed to be having a few " technical problems			1
" the last thing we heard was that they 'd had to " reboot " the camera -- which is technically 15 cameras set on top of a green contraption on the back of some poor fellow who has to carry all 18kg up the mountain			2
poor @entity38 -- they had to turn back last week because of bad weather			1
but this would not stop us from finishing the climb			0
remarkably our cell phones still worked and i was not feeling the effects of the altitude			0
we were overtaken by a few @entity0 marathon runners who can take the mountain in around 3 hours flat ; that 's at the end of july			1
it was also nice to have @entity2 's long - time friend @entity120 with us			2
he helped out with our coverage during the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck eastern @entity1 in 2011			1
@entity120 is a member of the @entity1 alpine club and the person to speak to about all things @entity0			1
he 's climbed it ten times -- he even showed me the route he skied down in may			1
if you fall on that ice , he says you 'll need an ice - axe to stop , otherwise you 'll slide to your death			0
so only for extreme skiers -- his words			0
i also discovered that @entity137 are a @entity1 invention			2
can this be true ? at any rate if i could remember how they tasted the last ( and possibly only ) time i ate them , i 'd say they 'd never tasted so good			0
but as it is , up here at altitude , that salty and shrimpy mixture was nothing short of perfection			0
plus in @entity1 you 're allowed to slurp them , making the experience all the more fun			2
as we neared the summit , everyone seemed 100 % fit			2
however , @entity2 producer @entity156 started to feel nervous about what was still ahead			0
she was part of last week 's aborted venture and said her muscle ache only went away yesterday			0
@entity162 's climb in pictures above .			0

@entity165 will join team from @entity38 as they chart a route to @entity0 's summit
the *expedition* marks the end of @entity165 's assignment in @entity34
