" this , oddly enough , would not be the only time a ready - to - wear look would be compared to the pelt - wearing villain 's wardrobe during @entity14			0
as fashion week faded to black thursday with the final shows by @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , the stylish affair ended exactly the way it started -- with fur , fur , everywhere , from fox to raccoon to mink			1
on opening day , @entity25 showed off a collection inspired by @entity28 's architecture and the gypsies of southern @entity30			0
amid the layers of chunky knit sweaters and patterned tunics were knee - length , patterned fur vests and cropped fur jackets			1
it 's not only real pelts prancing the catwalk			0
designers such as @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 accented their offerings with faux fur elements			1
" this is almost the golden age in fur , " said @entity46 , the @entity47			1
" our skin prices are going up 20 - 30 % every year			0
" all this fur fervor raises the question : is using real animal hide worth the potential controversy ? after all , it 's difficult to forget the great raccoon incident of ' 96 , in which an animal - rights activist served @entity60 editor - in - chief @entity59 a dead raccoon at her lunch at the @entity63			1
we have n't seen a paint - splashed mink in the headlines lately			0
is it possible the moral outrage over the use of animal skin is over ? veteran furrier @entity72 celebrated his brand 's 30th anniversary with a runway collection of dazzling gowns and statement furs			2
and relative newcomer @entity78 , who previously worked in the fur departments for @entity80 and @entity81 , displayed 20 ensembles , incorporating @entity84 mink and fox fur			2
non-fur - centric designers , like @entity25 , played with fur collars , hats , capes , stoles and detailing			1
there was fur in natural hues , as well as dyed			2
there were even furry boots			0
photos : fashion week in a flash " fur is the most luxurious thing you can use down the runway , " said @entity99 , chief creative officer for @entity25 designs , and @entity25 's wife			1
@entity99 said the brand uses both real and faux fur in its designs , but the runway entices artistic extravagance			1
@entity113 's fall presentation was pelt - heavy , including a nude tulle gown with black fox fur panels			1
for @entity113 , an upstart in the business at just 21 , the appeal comes from fur 's versatility			2
" you can use it on a coat , a jacket , or even a dress , " @entity113 said			0
" you can pair it with leather , sequins , wool			0
" @entity113 said his brand is all about specialty , luxury fabrics , and fur matches that particular mindset			2
the furry look is right on trend for fall and winter of 2013 , according to fashion forecaster @entity139			1
meanwhile , around the tents , many attendees cloaked themselves in fur to keep warm amid the historic snowfall that buried the @entity145 in the middle of @entity14			2
industry experts like @entity46 attribute the fur frenzy to its newfound accessibility -- no longer associated only with the rich , grandmotherly set , it has caught on with a younger , hipper crowd			1
fur is also more widely available to consumers			2
it 's not exclusive to specialty fur boutiques like @entity72 's @entity158 store			2
high - end department stores now carry scads of the fluffy stuff			0
but the fur - lined autumn and winter collections are a sharp contrast to @entity166 's presentation last wednesday , which was billed as the first all - vegan independent fashion house to show during @entity169			1
vegan couture : faux meets fabulous the label 's founder opted for organic cotton velvets and velveteen , colorful faux fur and soy fiber knits			1
@entity178 , who crafted the animal - free men 's shoes for @entity166 's presentation , said the use of leather and fur is tough to rationalize now because of the technological advances of faux products			1
@entity187 's @entity46 disagreed : " the studies have shown that faux fur is an environmental nightmare			1
that it 's a non-biodegradable product made from petroleum whereas fur is very biodegradable and has a long shelf - life			2
" but @entity46 also contends that designers now feel more confident using the real deal after examining the chain of production and finding it humane			1
according to the @entity200 , the @entity199 is the world 's largest producer of factory farmed fur			2
farms like @entity187 's are governed by @entity199 farming regulations			0
@entity206 is the second largest worldwide producer of fur pelts , but the country is often lambasted for its lack of regulation			2
fur farming is currently banned in the @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215			0
" fur is not for everybody , " @entity46 said			0
" for people that have made the decision not to use fur , we certainly respect that			0
but , other people should also respect the right for a designer to use it			0
" saga 's fur auction house , located in western @entity230 , supplies fox , mink and @entity234 raccoon to more than 400 designers globally , many of which are showing at @entity14			1
another reason for the fur boom is that companies like @entity187 are wooing and supporting young designers			1
saga operates a research facility in @entity244 , the @entity245 , and invites established and emerging designers to visit and experiment with new techniques			0
in the case of anticipated newcomers who might not have the capital to purchase the high - end product , @entity46 said the @entity245 will make an investment in their first collection by providing a couple of pelts			0
more than 25,000 fashion industry workers have visited the center since it opened in 1988 , according to @entity187 's website			0
as for faux fur , designers say imitation is the best form of flattery			1
" i think the use of real fur vs. faux fur is up to the designer and the wearer			1
i prefer real fur , it 's more luxe , " designer @entity113 said			0
" a woman should have options and i think a lot of people do buy synthetic furs , " @entity99 said , adding that he thinks the product still needs further development			0
still , staunchly anti-fur designers argue it 's as simple as changing the perception of luxury -- and the definition of cool			0
" in the fashion world , being a villain is definitely a sought after aesthetic and that 's a problem for ethical designers because we come across as the do - gooders , " @entity178 said			0

fur was *omnipresent* in the fall and winter collections at @entity169
fur industry *insider* says designers *approve* of their chain of production and find it humane
animal rights designers say faux fur can be luxurious and stylish , and is a *viable* alternative
