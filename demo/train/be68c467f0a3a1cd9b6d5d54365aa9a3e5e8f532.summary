-- when the doors opened onto @entity5 's @entity4 studios after the televised @entity7 mayoral debate tuesday night , reporters rushed in to surround two people			1
the first was public advocate @entity10 -- in first place , according to a @entity13 poll released earlier in the day			0
but the larger crowd was surrounding @entity15 , the former congressman who is polling in fourth place and who spent much of the night being ignored by his rivals			1
@entity15 may have turned his once - promising campaign into a disaster with the recent fresh crop of sexting revelations , but he has not ceased being the star of the campaign , much to his rivals ' chagrin			1
@entity15 is now reaching for a silver lining from the scandal that has cost him dearly in the polls and sealed off whatever long - shot chances he had at victory			1
he 's taking all the unflattering , pun - filled stories about him and saying " that 's what it 's like to be mayor			2
" he 's turning his unflattering press into evidence of his mettle			2
so , the more fights with the media , the more chances he has to say he 's independent , he 's fighting , he 's ready for @entity44			1
last week , he mocked a @entity47 reporter 's accent during an impromptu interview outside a public housing building where he was campaigning			0
their exchange ended with him giving an unsolicited weather report to viewers in @entity47			0
( " it 's gon na be raining , cloudy and gray			0
so do what you can , guys , " he said			0
) while being mayor of @entity4 is indeed akin to being in the eye of a media storm , what 's happening to candidate @entity15 is different			1
opinion : hey @entity15 , @entity4 does n't like to look stupid he omitted a key detail in the redemption story that he brought to the race : @entity15 continued sexting after resigning from @entity67 and tearfully telling the public how much pain it had caused his wife and those close to him			1
that is what is at the heart of the criticism			0
it 's not the newness of the details but rather the newness of the facts			2
but for a candidate who is less than a month away from the primary , there is little to do but continue			0
he has a reputation to salvage , issues to push and campaign money to spend			0
so , given the circumstances , the bad - news - is - proof - i 'm - ready argument may be @entity15 's only argument			1
and so , in a live interview with @entity94 editor @entity93 on monday , @entity15 fielded questions about his sexting scandal and the role his wife may play in an expected @entity100 presidential campaign , and he accused the @entity101 of " never " liking him , because of his independence			1
( in 2008 , after an unflattering story about his frequent staff changes , @entity15 told me the @entity101 had become " tabloidy			2
" ) hours before tuesday 's debate , @entity15 's campaign released a video showing the candidate happily announcing that he does n't care what the @entity109 or @entity110 say about him , because he 's so independent from them			1
when @entity15 launched his campaign in late april , it was viewed largely as an effort to rehabilitate his image after his 2011 scandal and resignation from @entity67			2
nobody wants the last words on this career to be " sex scandal , " " resignation " or " disgrace			0
" but @entity15 has lost ground since his scandal resurfaced ; just last month , polls had him leading the @entity7 field			1
opinion : @entity131 ' sexters ' give @entity15 a pass ? on tuesday night , @entity15 tried painting the rivals on stage with him as all coming from the same political establishment that has long governed @entity4			1
about halfway through the debate , @entity15 said , " my fellow @entity4 , this is the problem , " referring to his rivals , who had just been arguing with one another on stage			1
" you know they all come from basically the same place ; they 've been part of municipal government for decades now			0
they 've all been part of it : a comptroller , a former comptroller , a public advocate , a speaker			0
they 're from the same place			0
" he told viewers that if they wanted someone to " stop this noise , " he was their candidate			0
" not for nothing , " countered city council speaker @entity159 , " you were in government your whole career until you had to resign from government , so i 'm not sure why you 're finger - pointing at people in government			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			2

@entity169 : @entity15 falling in polls but still draws most attention ; trying to leverage that
he says @entity15 *slamming* press , using media criticism to show he 's ready to be @entity4 mayor
he says media criticism is n't over old details of sexting but new revelations @entity15 kept doing it
@entity185 : with primary *looming* , painting himself as independent may be his best shot
