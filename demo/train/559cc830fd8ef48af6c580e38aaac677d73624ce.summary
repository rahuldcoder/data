, @entity1 in @entity2 have retrenched their opposition in a shocking manner			1
the @entity12 adopted a plank in its platform endorsing reparative therapy for gays and lesbians , even though such treatments have been rejected as harmful by all leading medical and psychological associations and even outlawed in some states			1
@entity2 gov. @entity20 added fuel to the fire by comparing gays and lesbians to alcoholics and refusing to step back from such insulting comments			1
@entity20 's views , however , bear further exploration			2
in his remarks , he used genetic predispositions to make his comparison : " i may have the genetic coding that i 'm inclined to be an alcoholic , but i have the desire not to do that -- and i look at the homosexual issue the same way			0
" at a very superficial level , there is a kernel of truth here			0
scientific studies have demonstrated that biology plays a role in one 's sexual orientation			1
studies of identical twins , who share the same genes , have shown that , if one twin is gay , the other is more likely to be gay , suggesting sexual orientation is influenced by genetics			1
scientists also discovered a " fraternal birth order effect " : the more male children a woman has , the greater chance that the next one will be gay			2
the reason for this effect is unknown , but it suggests there may be some change in the mother 's body that influences the development of the male fetus			2
perhaps the greatest furor over the biological origins of sexual orientation occurred in 1993			1
scientist @entity68 and others published a study in @entity71 that showed a connection between a particular part of the x chromosome and male homosexuality			0
although the study did not find a particular gene , it suggested that such a gene exists on the x chromosome			2
more recent studies have identified other potential links between homosexuality and genetics , and scientists have offered explanations on how same - sex attraction could advance procreation			0
reviewing all the various studies in his 2012 book , " @entity90 : the @entity71 , " neuroscientist @entity100 concludes that , " taken together , the multitude of research studies published since 1991 have greatly strengthened the idea that biological factors play a significant rule in the development of sexual orientationâ € ” in both men and in women			0
" many gay rights activists laud these studies because they support the argument that @entity9 persons should be afforded legal protections because sexual orientation is an immutable trait , akin to race or gender			1
if it 's in our genes , you ca n't discriminate against us			2
but finding the biological origins of same - sex attraction has the potential to undermine the rights of gays and lesbians			2
for example , could someone try to get a patent on a gene related to sexual orientation ? while it is possible to patent certain genetic material , the gene must be " useful " to qualify for patent protection			1
why would a gene related to sexual orientation be useful ? most patents on genes relate to diseases , such as breast cancer , diabetes , or , as @entity20 noted , alcoholism			1
the utility of these inventions is readily apparent â € ” developing treatments for these pathological conditions			0
but what use is a gay gene -- to " treat " gays and lesbians ? i believe such genetic discoveries should not be patent eligible because they are not useful			1
gays and lesbians are not sick , and the medical community agrees			2
the exploration of why a gay gene should not be viewed as " useful " highlights the broader concern with these scientific studies : it becomes easier for @entity9 opponents to argue that gays and lesbians are biologically flawed , akin to a disease that should be and could be cured			1
the 1996 movie " @entity154 " explores this dynamic in the context of a prenatal test that could predict the likelihood that the child would be gay , and the consequent decision of whether to end the pregnancy			0
in a more commercial and thinly veiled context , the 2006 movie " x-men : @entity168 " explored the potential implications of inventing and administering a " cure " for a stigmatized physiological condition			0
even though we tend to view science as objective , it is often laden with moral considerations			0
the concept of a " gay gene " reveals this normative slant			1
why is it the " gay " gene and not just the " sexual orientation " gene , or even the " straight " gene ? calling it the " gay gene " reveals the bias in favor of heterosexuality , which risks viewing gays and lesbians as biologically flawed and thus inferior			1
@entity9 legal rights should not be contingent on biology or immutability			0
and , contrary to @entity20 's insinuation , sexual orientation is not like a disease			1
it is like eye color or left - handedness -- a natural and healthy variation within the population			0
we must take care that our rights do not hinge on biology			0
while it is strange to find wisdom from comic book characters , @entity206 's character storm in the x-men had it right : there is nothing to cure			0
there is nothing wrong with us			0
and our rights should n't depend on it .			0

in @entity2 , the @entity1 endorses reparative therapy for gays and lesbians
@entity223 : sexual orientation is a trait like race or gender , it should n't be fixed
he says if there 's a gay gene , there 's no need for treatment since gays are not sick
@entity223 : sexual orientation is not like a disease , it does n't need to be cured
