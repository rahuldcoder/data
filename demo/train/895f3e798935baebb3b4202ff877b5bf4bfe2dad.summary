-- a busy sunday saw four tournaments across three continents settled to underline the truly global nature of modern golf			1
@entity6 's @entity5 became the oldest winner on the @entity8 as the 48 - year - old took top honors at the @entity11 , while @entity13 's @entity12 won in @entity14 to reclaim the world no. 2 ranking from @entity16			1
in @entity18 , @entity17 held off @entity20 hero @entity19 to take his first title in 15 months at the @entity18 masters and ease the pain of his @entity25 @entity11 heartbreak back in july			1
and if that was n't enough @entity27 's @entity26 completed a hectic sunday by recording victory in the @entity30 at the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33			2
do ' nice guys ' finish last ? how to heal major heartbreak but back to @entity37 , and the heroics of @entity5 who captured his 19th @entity8 title and his 12th since turning 40 , by one shot over @entity27 's @entity42			1
@entity5 , a @entity43 vice captain in the recent @entity20 , recorded a final round of 65 to earn his place in the record books by virtue of being six months older than @entity48 when he won the @entity49 in 2001			1
" it 's very nice -- i hope it 's not the last one , " @entity5 joked in quotes on the @entity8 's official website			1
" the most important thing , i do what i like to do in my life , and golf has given me all of this pleasure			2
winning now , at 48 , my goodness -- 24 years i 've been on the @entity8			1
" i still love it and i think that is fantastic , to love what you 're doing , and enjoy yourself , keep fit , keep working myself a little bit and stretching a lot , and that 's the main thing to do to compete with the new guns			0
" i really love this place			0
i love the golf course -- it 's a great golf course where you have to control the ball very well , it 's not a matter of distance			2
" there were mixed fortunes for two other players who played their part in @entity43 's remarkable @entity20 comeback in @entity79			0
@entity12 cruised to victory at the @entity81 in @entity14 by five shots to reclaim the world no. 2 ranking from 14 - time major winner @entity16			1
@entity12 , who led from the front for most of the competition in @entity87 , still has a long way to go to topple @entity89 who is out in front of the rankings but he was delighted with his win			1
he said on micro-blogging site @entity93 : " @entity95 ! 3rd win of the year - honored to add my name to the great champions that have won the @entity81			2
golfer : i thought i was going to die " loved my week here in @entity14 - the @entity81 is a great event , on a great course , great food , great beer ...			1
it 's just great ! " but @entity19 was pipped to the @entity18 masters crown by @entity17 after the @entity13 carded a disappointing final round			1
with the pair well clear of the chasing pack sunday came down to a straight shoot out between the pair and @entity17 went some way to erasing the painful memory of his @entity25 @entity11 experience , when he led with four holes left and ended up losing			1
@entity17 's triumph means he has continued his run of winning at least one event in every season since 2001			1
after receiving his trophy and the golden jacket that goes with it he set his sights on a jacket of a different color -- the green one awarded to the winner of the masters in @entity130			2
" it 's pretty awesome to be able to slip this jacket on			0
maybe i can set the theme of winning jackets and turn it green next year before i come back to defend , " he was quoted as saying on the tournament 's website			0
" i have n't been dwelling on what happened at the @entity11 at all , i put that out of my head in the week afterwards			0
" i had to , otherwise you 'd never come back to a golf course , would you ? it 's kind of painful			2
i 'd been working hard and i had n't quite got back in that position until today , but i felt good out there			0
" i just had to trust that all the work that i 'd put into my game was going to hold up and to not get in my own way is the big thing			0
" not ( to ) have thoughts of what happened at the @entity11 or any other negative thoughts come into play -- that 's just part of the mental side of this game			0
" the last of sunday 's winner was 28 - year - old @entity26 , who held off the late challenge of @entity158 to end a five - year run without a @entity8 victory			1
he also secured his place at next week 's @entity162 in @entity163 after closing the tournament on 17 - under , despite a blip half way through his round when he fell back to level pegging with his @entity33 challenger			0
" it was great that i came down here , " he told the @entity8 website			2
" one of the bigger reasons was i was 59th in the race to @entity163 standings and i needed a good week			0
" i made it difficult for myself in the middle of the round there but hung in there and stayed patient			0
i played well to shoot 17 under par around here in these windy conditions			0
it was playing a lot harder today			0
