a @entity3 detective justifiably shot a schizophrenic 18 - year - old because he believed another officer 's life was in danger , a group representing police officers said , offering an account vastly different from that of the late teen 's outraged family			1
the @entity3 @entity12 laid out its version of what happened in @entity15 in a statement issued wednesday , three days after @entity17 was killed			2
the most salient part was its defense of a @entity21 police detective for shooting @entity17 after , in its view , determining that the teenager posed a " deadly threat " to another officer			1
the professional organization represents both these officers but not a sheriff 's deputy also at the scene			2
" ( the ) detective ... employed authorized law enforcement action to stop the continuing threat of deadly harm to ( the officer ) and others , " the @entity12 concluded			1
the @entity21 detective 's lawyer , w. @entity37 , has told @entity41 affiliate @entity40 that once investigations into the shooting are complete , " all folks -- everybody -- will conclude that the officers acted appropriately			1
" @entity37 elaborated to @entity41 on wednesday night , claiming that his client fired after @entity17 made multiple attempts to stab the other officer with a screwdriver			1
the other officer was wearing a bulletproof vest and was not injured			0
wednesday 's statements are the most detailed public defense yet of the law enforcement officers involved in sunday 's incident			2
" we can say , based on our preliminary findings , that we are very confident that the officers did what they should have under state law , " the law enforcement trade association 's director , @entity56 , said wednesday night			2
" it 's a very tragic situation , but we do believe the officers			2
" @entity17 's family has offered a starkly disparate view in its pleas this week for justice , as they see it , by holding the @entity21 detective directly responsible			1
" my brother just needed help , and now he is dead , " stepbrother @entity70 said in an emotional video posted to @entity72			0
@entity70 was not there when his stepbrother was shot but wanted to speak on behalf of his family , he said wednesday			0
" this officer who shot my son needs to be behind bars , " said @entity17 's mother , @entity78			1
" he needs to die the way my son died			0
" @entity41 first learned of the shooting through an @entity72 sent by a family friend			0
according to @entity70 , @entity17 had schizophrenia and " was having an episode " when his father contacted police to subdue him so he could get help			0
" he 's not doing very good			0
you 've got to get him someplace , " a man who identified himself as @entity17 's stepfather said on a 911 call , a copy of which was obtained by @entity41 affiliate @entity95			2
" he wants to fight his mother			0
... she 's scared to death of him right now			0
" the caller said that @entity17 " wo n't take his medication " and his family has had " to put him in before , ( and ) he 's getting real bad again			1
" @entity70 said wednesday that @entity15 police were familiar with @entity17 , having gone to the family 's house at least three times before			1
and the family has no qualms with the first two law enforcement officers who responded -- one from @entity15 police and the other a @entity118 's deputy -- with the stepbrother saying they " did nothing wrong			2
" " all they did was taze my brother and try to get him into handcuffs so he could n't harm himself , " said @entity70 , who was n't at the scene but relayed his family 's account			0
" they had the situation under control			0
" but the family says the situation unnecessarily took a turn for the worse when the @entity21 detective arrived			0
stepfather @entity134 told @entity95 that @entity17 had been tased and was pinned when one of the officers said , " we do n't have time for this " and fired his gun			1
seventy seconds after the third officer arrived , @entity95 reported , citing police records , police radioed that the teenager had been shot in self - defense			0
@entity15 police and the @entity147 have both cleared their officers involved in the case after finding , in internal reviews , no evidence they 'd violated policy or state law			0
@entity21 police put its detective -- the man the benevolent association says shot @entity17 -- on paid administrative leave , a step that @entity56 said is standard for any officer involved in a fatal shooting			1
police chief @entity161 said wednesday that the detective 's record is spotless , adding that his department has n't had an officer - involved shooting in about 20 years			1
asked about his detective 's judgment in shooting an 18 - year - old who his family said weighed about 100 pounds , @entity161 said , " well , that 's what i 'm waiting for when i hear all the inquiries that are made			1
" specifically , the @entity174 and the chief prosecutor for the state 's 13th @entity176 are both looking into the matter			0
the @entity3 @entity12 said it " welcomes " these investigations , but at the same time that it " assigned local counsel " to look into the matter			0
its director , @entity56 , explained this investigation consisted of talking to two officers involved who are members of -- and thus represented by -- his association			0
the group said that three officers from three agencies responded to @entity17 's house " due to the dangerous nature of the call			1
" @entity17 " failed to comply with repeated requests to surrender the deadly weapon , " which the 911 caller said was a screwdriver , the @entity12 reported			2
what the officers did next -- such as using a @entity202 -- were " authorized and necessary law enforcement procedures ... to promote safety for everyone involved , including @entity17 , " the group added			1
the detective fired after @entity17 " made physical contact with the ( @entity15 officer ) using the hand holding the deadly weapon , " the police association said in its statement			1
" the officers present realized the immediate and deadly threat to ( the officer 's ) life , " said the group			1
the pain and perhaps anger felt by @entity17 's family is understandable			1
yet @entity56 said that it is important to understand too that the challenges faced by law enforcement , who sometimes have to decide , in a split second , whether they need to act to save their , one of their colleagues or someone else 's life			0
" officers struggle every time they are put in a situation like this , because they are human beings , too , " said the state benevolent association 's leader			2
" it is always a tragedy , no matter how justified ( the use of force ) might be			0
