more @entity1 women have had medical help to have their babies than ever , according to the latest annual report from the @entity5			1
the group represents the greater majority of in vitro fertilization clinics in the @entity1			1
their report showed that doctors at these clinics performed 165,172 procedures , including @entity13 , with 61,740 babies born as a result of those efforts in 2012			1
that 's about 2,000 more babies born using treatments from @entity13 clinics than in 2011			1
that also makes 2012 the year with the highest percentage of babies born through @entity13 than ever reported previously , according to the society			1
that upward trend is the opposite of @entity1 birth rates overall			1
since 2007 , the @entity1 birth rate has been declining steadily			1
in 2012 , more than 3.95 million babies were born , the @entity29 reports ( @entity31 )			2
that 's below what demographers call the " replacement level , " the level at which the generation can replace itself			0
of those births , @entity13 treatments account for about 1.5 % of all babies born in the @entity1 that year			1
this growing trend does n't necessarily mean @entity1 are having more trouble having children			2
it may point to the fact that couples are having babies later			0
@entity1 women are having babies a lot later in life than they used to : in 1980 , the average age of a new mom was about 22			1
now , the average age of a new mom is closer to 26 , according to the @entity29 ( @entity31 )			0
although women today are generally healthier , fertility does decline as people age			2
a woman 's body produces fewer viable eggs when she gets older , and men 's sperm does n't swim as well as they age			0
women ca n't wait too long to seek out treatment , though			2
that is also clear from the annual report			0
the @entity13 success rate was significantly higher for women under the age of 35 compared with those who were older			1
looking only at the @entity13 treatments that used fresh embryos from non-donor eggs , the number of women under the age of 35 who gave birth using @entity13 was about 40 % , compared with only 31 % for women between the ages of 35 and 37			1
only 3.9 % of 42 - year - olds got pregnant as a result of @entity13 treatment			2
@entity13 treatment has become more medically successful over the years and is gaining acceptance			2
it is still , however , cost - prohibitive for a lot of couples			0
most assisted reproductive technologies are not covered by insurance , or the reimbursements are capped , according the @entity89			0
the average cost of one @entity13 treatment in the @entity1 is $ 12,400 , and that 's without the extra medicines the couple may need , according to the @entity95			1
often , couples will need more than one treatment to conceive			0
the number of multiple embryos being transferred in @entity13 treatments has also declined , according to the report			0
doctors prefer that women give birth to a single baby or " singleton , " as they are called in medical lingo			0
that 's because even with medical advances , multiple births are still considered risky for mothers and babies			0
the real reason behind the multiples baby boom			0

about 2,000 more in vitro fertilization babies were born in 2012 than 2011
since 2007 , the @entity1 birth rate has been declining steadily
@entity13 treatment success rates decline as women age
