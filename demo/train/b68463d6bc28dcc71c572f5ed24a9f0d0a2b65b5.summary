-- those of us who knew @entity3 understood that his baseball dreams were all behind him			1
we could n't have been more wrong			2
@entity3 -- he insisted that we call him that ; " mr. @entity3 , " he said , was too formal -- was the one man in our central @entity9 town of 13,000 who had been a professional ballplayer			1
he had been captain of the baseball team at @entity12 , and had led the @entity13 in hitting in 1932 and 1933			1
the people who knew him back then thought he would have a shining career in the majors			2
and in fact , the @entity18 organization signed him to a contract			2
but he injured his knee , and in the big leagues being just half a step slow means you 're probably not going to make it			0
so from 1935 to 1941 , he played in the low minor leagues , for @entity29 and @entity28 teams like the @entity30 , @entity9 , @entity31 , and the @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , and the @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity18			1
which was all right with him			0
@entity38 was the love of his life , and he was very good at it , and he was being paid , although not much , to play it			0
then @entity43 arrived , and he was called to military service and his days on the diamond were over			0
those of us who knew him in the 1950s and 1960s were friends of his children , with whom we were growing up			0
@entity3 and his wife , @entity50 , raised their young family , and @entity3 ran a succession of taverns and restaurants , some more successful than others			1
his love of baseball never died			2
he was an assistant coach at @entity12 for 10 years , and after that he seemed to be a volunteer coach for just about every league in town			2
" @entity64 's been gone for more than 10 years , " his daughter @entity62 told me the other day			0
" and i still run into people who tell me , ' your dad was my @entity68 coach			0
' or , ' your father give me my first baseball glove			2
' " if you were a kid in a summer league around town , you probably saw @entity3 in the stands			1
he was always so encouraging ; his opinion meant more than anyone else 's , because he was the man who had been a pro ballplayer			0
if you were n't especially good -- i can vouch for this -- it meant the world to you to hear @entity3 's voice shouting " @entity82 throw , " or " good hustle			1
" why am i telling you this today ? because in the early 1950s , before any of us were old enough to know him , he ran a tavern called the @entity86			2
he was the owner and the bartender			0
one of his steady customers was a young @entity90 second lieutenant assigned to nearby @entity91			0
the customer 's name was @entity94			1
" @entity64 told me that mr. @entity94 never ordered an alcoholic beverage , " @entity95 said			1
" he would come in and order a @entity97 with a cherry in it			0
and he would sit there and he and my father would talk about baseball for hours on end			2
" this was many years before @entity94 , who died last week at the age of 80 , bought the @entity107 ; @entity94 with his @entity97 and @entity3 behind the bar were just two guys who loved to talk baseball			1
@entity3 never struck it rich in business , but @entity94 , of course , did , and despite the difference in their worlds they remained friends over the years			1
" every time we would see mr. @entity94 , he would say to us children , ' your father taught me everything i know about baseball , ' " @entity62 said			1
it may not have been literally true , but it was a lovely thing to tell the @entity126 children , and they always were grateful for how @entity94 treated their dad			1
when @entity3 was dying in the summer of 1999 , @entity62 said , " the thing that he hated the most was that he had macular degeneration , which meant that his eyesight had badly failed			1
he could n't read the baseball box scores in the newspapers any more			2
that made him really sad			0
" three weeks before he died in a nursing home , he received a telephone call from @entity94			1
" they talked for a very long time , " @entity62 said			0
" we did n't hear the conversation , but we knew what it was about			0
@entity64 and mr. @entity94 talked about baseball			1
just like they always did			0
" @entity3 died on a july thursday in 1999			1
before the funeral , @entity146 's telephone rang			0
he said he planned to do something to honor her husband			0
and so it was , on the day @entity3 was buried in @entity9 , that @entity94 issued an order to his staff at @entity155 in @entity33			1
the @entity107 were n't playing at home that day			0
but @entity94 ordered that the big @entity158 flag in center field be raised , and then lowered to half - staff			1
several weeks later , a package arrived at @entity146 's home			0
inside it was the flag , along with a photo of it at half - staff overlooking the most famous baseball palace in the world			2
" i know that mr. @entity94 was a controversial guy , and that there were a lot of people who did n't like him , " @entity95 said			1
" but i hope you can understand why our family loved him			0
" we who knew @entity3 thought his dreams of baseball glory had drifted away			1
but what did we know ? in the end , against all odds and expectations , this impossible thing came true : he made it all the way to @entity155			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			0
