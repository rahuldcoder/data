this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : hi , everyone			2
i 'm @entity18 , and you 're tuned in to @entity0 ! it 's thursday , may 26th , and you can leave the next ten minutes to us			1
first up : speech to @entity24 @entity25 : first up , president @entity26 makes a speech that some people are calling the main event of his week - long trip to @entity31			2
it happened in front of the @entity24 ; it 's a legislative group that 's kinda like the @entity34			1
during the speech , the president talked about a lot of world issues that the @entity38 and @entity39 have faced together			1
that includes the economic crisis , the wars in @entity43 and @entity44 , and the revolutions , protests and conflict happening right now in the @entity49 world , like in @entity6			1
the president said the @entity38 and @entity39 should and will provide an example for other nations to follow			1
@entity38 president @entity26 : the time for our leadership is now			1
it was the @entity38 and the @entity39 and our democratic allies that shaped a world in which new nations could emerge and individuals could thrive			1
and even as more nations take on the responsibilities of global leadership , our alliance will remain indispensable to the goal of a century that is more peaceful , more prosperous and more just			2
@entity25 : all right , you just heard the president mention the alliance between the @entity38 and @entity39 @entity70 looks back now at some of the recent moments in that close relationship			1
( begin video ) queen elizabeth ii : ladies and gentlemen , we are here to celebrate the tried , tested and , yes , special relationship between our two countries			1
@entity70 , @entity0 anchor : and it 's that special relationship that has defined @entity38 foreign policy for generations			1
@entity86 , former u.s. president : prime minister , the entire world salutes you and your gallant people and gallant nation			2
@entity93 : or remember former prime minister @entity94 , sometimes criticized for being a little too friendly with president @entity95			2
their chumminess got @entity94 in political trouble at home			2
his support for the @entity43 war won him more friends in the @entity34 than across the pond			1
@entity94 , former british prime minister : we will be with you in this fight for liberty			2
and if our spirit is right and our courage firm , the world will be with us			2
@entity93 : and now , the @entity38 and @entity39 have come together on two other wars : in @entity44 and @entity6			1
beyond the battlefield , there are real economic ties that bind			2
each country invests over $ 400 billion in the other 's economy			1
and nearly 200,000 @entity38 citizens live and work in the @entity39			1
so , for prime minister @entity121 and president @entity26 , this relationship is not something either leader takes for granted			1
@entity26 : as @entity125 said on a visit to the @entity38 , above all , among the @entity5 - speaking peoples , there must be the union of hearts , based upon convictions and common ideals			1
( @entity132 ) @entity6 @entity133 @entity25 : president @entity26 and @entity39 prime minister @entity121 both discussed progress being made in @entity6 's civil war			1
but they also said that the conflict could last longer than people expect			0
@entity6 's long - time leader , @entity141 , and his forces are fighting against rebels who want @entity141 out of power			1
and there 's concern about how @entity6 's civilians are being affected in all this			1
@entity149 traveled to the outskirts of one @entity6 town to find out how living conditions -- and living locations -- can change in times of war			1
( begin video ) @entity157 , @entity158 : he 's taking us to see some caves where we 're told families have been hiding from the shelling			1
we 've yet to see the caves , but we 're certainly seeing a lot of children			0
and this is the only place in @entity167 we 've seen children			0
look at them here : families and children			0
they 've deserted the streets of the city and they 're living out here on the edge			1
the caves , we 're told , have n't been lived in by people for about 60 years , but because of the random shelling , they 're now going back to hiding in them again			0
this is the old part of @entity167 , right on the hills , on the edge			0
you really feel like you 're going into the ancient city here			0
you can see the power cable now , running inside here			0
the people can have electricity , some light at night			0
this is a whole underground labyrinth of caves			0
the roof is blackened by soot from fires , years of fires			0
then you come out here into this , and the only way out of here is a ladder			0
it 's an absolute labyrinth			1
every side you look , there 's an entrance here , here , here , here , another room here with a light bulb			1
this was n't here 60 years ago			0
there 's blankets in there if you take a look			1
blankets , carpets , space for people to live and hide from the shelling			0
( @entity132 ) @entity38 @entity221 @entity25 : to the @entity38 now			1
parts of the country 's mid-section are struggling through a historic tornado season			1
officials say more than 500 people have been killed in the storms			0
the latest round of severe weather hit @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234			0
@entity231 's governor declared a state of emergency in 68 of the state 's 77 counties			1
that will help free up resources for recovery efforts			0
emergency personnel were called out immediately after the storms			0
some are searching for victims			0
others are working to get power back up and running for the tens of thousands of people who lost it			0
officials have determined that the tornado that hit nearby @entity253 , @entity254 was a 5 on the @entity255			0
the scale measures tornado intensity based on how much damage they cause			0
a 5 is as high as you can get			0
@entity261 in @entity262 @entity25 : a handful of @entity265 ships are sailing into @entity7			0
that 's because it 's @entity261 ! the @entity268 kicks off the annual event before the vessels drop their anchors at different spots around @entity7			1
@entity261 gives service members the chance for some @entity275 in the @entity276			0
and it gives civilians the opportunity to go aboard these @entity265 ships			0
this week 's @entity261 also brings the @entity280 back to @entity7 for the first time since it was commissioned			1
part of the ship was made from steel that was recovered from the @entity285 that were attacked on 9/11 nearly ten years ago			0
new fuel labels @entity25 : when you go to buy a car , the window sticker gives you a lot of information			1
but government officials want it to give you more , and in a year or two , that sticker will			0
new fuel efficiency labels will be required for all new cars starting in 2013			1
in addition to miles per gallon , you 'll see how much you might save -- or spend -- on gas over five years , and how the vehicle stacks up against similar models			0
environmental groups support the idea of offering consumers this extra information , but some of them wanted the new labels to assign each vehicle a letter grade			1
@entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , things like that			0
critics thought the grades might be too confusing			0
@entity0 @entity318 @entity25 : at @entity320 , we are all about your input			0
we want to know your thoughts on class rankings			0
are you for or against them ? that 's the newest question in our @entity328			2
you can find that on our home page			2
next one is for students			2
as we wrap up our school year next week , we 're going to be talking about the biggest headlines from 2010 - 2011			0
you 'll see a list of the stories on our blog			2
what we want is to hear your thoughts on them			0
why were these headlines significant ? what do you remember most ? so teachers : class rankings			0
@entity320 : get to it ! @entity350 @entity351 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity354 's social studies students at @entity355 in @entity356 , @entity357 ! @entity38 pennies are made mostly of what metal ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) aluminum , b ) bronze , c ) copper or @entity366 ) zinc ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the first pennies were pure copper ; today , they 're more than 97 % zinc			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! before we go @entity25 : a project with pennies is making some students angry in @entity378			1
and it 's not because they 're not worth much			2
@entity381 , student : how has this gotten out of control ? why did this get out of control ? why was n't there a stop to it ? @entity25 : 14,300 pennies laid out on the cafeteria floor			0
she 's not angry about the project			2
she 's talking about what it represents : the @entity38 national debt			1
students spent four hours laying out the pennies , with each one symbolizing one billion dollars			2
the idea was to get other students thinking about the country 's $ 14.3 trillion debt			1
goodbye @entity25 : using pennies as a visual aid ? it 's an idea that makes a lot of cents			2
and it 's definitely a change of pace from your normal economics lesson			2
and if you 're out there groaning , just imagine how i feel			0
you can take that to the bank .			0
