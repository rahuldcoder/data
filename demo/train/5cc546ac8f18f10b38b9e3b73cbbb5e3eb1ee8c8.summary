@entity0 , @entity1 -- it might be many miles away from the usual sporting capitals of the world , but when it comes to long - distance running there 's one tiny place that 's setting the pace			1
nestled amidst rolling farmlands on the green hills of southern central @entity1 , @entity0 is a sleepy town of less than 20,000 people , most of whom are farmers and herders			1
but apart from the wheat and maize growing on @entity0 's fertile soil , this small town a few hours south from capital @entity22 is also the breeding ground for some of the best track and field athletes in the world			1
set at about 2,800 meters above sea level , @entity0 has produced a string of @entity30 champions and world - beating long - distance runners , including multiple olympic gold medal winners @entity33 and @entity35			1
@entity36 , the legendary coach who has so far trained four of @entity0 's olympic gold winners , says that a winning mix of thin air , lean diet and different terrains has helped the town 's rich crop of runners stand out in recent years			1
" our training fields are very conducive for athletics , " says @entity36 , 56 , who is known in @entity0 simply as " coach			1
" " we have downhill , flat land , all of these here in @entity0			1
the food they eat also has an impact , the weather has an impact , the combination of these makes the kids successful			0
" read this : @entity62 teens shoot for @entity64 glory @entity36 is quick to add , however , that favorable weather and training conditions do not guarantee success			1
determination and dedication are key , he says			0
" our runners are successful because they work hard , " he explains			2
" they work with the aim of reaching for success			0
this is what makes them different			0
" and if there 's anyone who should know about success , that 's @entity36			2
for some 25 years he has been discovering and nurturing the talents of some the finest runners in @entity1 -- a global powerhouse in long - distance running , with 35 @entity30 medals in the last 20 years			1
apart from @entity33 and @entity35 , @entity36 has also trained @entity86 , a two - time @entity30 champion , @entity87 , the marathon winner at the @entity89 , @entity90 , winner of the recent 2013 @entity92 , and many others			1

" when i recruit athletes , i look at those who have a desire to put in the work , " says @entity36			2
" i look at their shape			0
kids who are too short wo n't have good results			0
those who are tall walk upright and those who complete their training with passion , i recruit them			0
" they train here for three years after entering the camp			2
after three years , those with good results move on to other clubs			2
after that , based on their time , they compete in other races , even international ones			0
" but for the majority of these young athletes , this is not an easy road			0
poverty is common , sporting equipment does not come cheap and most get by on no more than two meals a day			0
" here athletes have difficulty with getting regular food , with owning shoes , they face a lot of problems , " says @entity36			2
" they have to sew their shoes , manage with little food , work long and hard , but i believe this allows them to become stronger and successful			0

last summer , as @entity33 sprinted through the finish line to win gold in the 10,000 meters at the @entity89 , @entity36 was watching proudly on a screen thousands of miles away			1
" @entity36 knew that my cousin @entity86 ran , " says @entity33			1
" he knew that my sisters ran too , that 's why he encouraged me to start running			0
he used to tell me that i would be a great runner			0
he knew i would be a fast runner that 's why he started coaching me			0
" for @entity33 , representing a country with such a distinguished athletics history brings a feeling of great responsibility			2
" our country is not like other countries , " says @entity33			2
" you should bring back gold when you compete for @entity1			1
the people do n't accept anything less , the people wo n't be happy with anything less			0
" silver and bronze in our country is no better than finishing fifth or sixth			0
i want to make people happy and therefore think of finishing first			0
my heart pounds when i think of this , and that why i train hard , to make the people happy			0
" driven by a strong sense of duty and a strong desire to produce successful athletes , @entity36 shows no signs of stopping			2
instead , he 's always keeping an eye out for the next rising star to come out of @entity0 's rich crop			1
