-- an @entity2 sports announcer was playing the classic game of spot - celebrities - in - the - stands during the gold medal @entity6 match in men 's basketball when this happened : " i know i 'm gon na put that picture on @entity19 , " @entity10 said as the camera showed a young man with curly hair and a red hat , according to a video posted on the blog @entity17			1
" we 've got every executive of note , it seems , worldwide , attending these games			1
" the problem : the man in the audience was n't @entity19 co-founder @entity28			1
it was the actor , @entity30 , who played him in the @entity33 - winning movie " @entity34			1
" @entity6 viewers outraged after @entity2 cuts away oops , right ? well , the @entity37 wo n't quite let a gaffe like that pass without some dissection			1
" hey ball announcer : that was @entity30 who played @entity28 in a movie			1
he did n't create @entity19			1
@entity46 " one user , @entity44 , wrote on @entity45			0
" the @entity47 - when you are absolutely certain that you 're looking at @entity28 but it 's really @entity50			2
# @entity52 , " wrote @entity51			0
another wrote that it was a " @entity54 for the @entity6			2
" it was just another reason to revive what has been the omnipresent @entity54 hashtag during the @entity58			0
that meme mostly has been used by @entity60 who have loved to complain about the fact that many of the 2012 @entity6 events were shown in the @entity60 on a tape delay			2
but maybe there 's something a little more interesting going on here : sports announcers make mistakes all the time			0
sure , it 's live tv			0
but in the same way that the comedian @entity73 sort of became @entity74 during the 2008 @entity60 presidential race , @entity30 became a sort of stand - in for @entity28 's real persona , particularly right after that movie debuted			1
( to make things all the more confusing , the pair appeared together on @entity82			0
) at the time , at least , some people seemed to know the fictional @entity28 better than the real thing			2
or perhaps that 's still the case			0
the man who started # @entity52 on @entity45			0

@entity2 *sportscaster* appears to mistake ' @entity34 ' actor for @entity28
a @entity17 video shows actor @entity30 at an @entity6 basketball match
announcer : " i know i 'm gon na put that picture on @entity19 "
" we 've got every executive of note , it seems , worldwide , attending these games , " he says
