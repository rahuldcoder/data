-- when the @entity2 kicks off this week in @entity3 , @entity4 , the nation will notice one thing before anything else : this is not your father 's or grandfather 's @entity10			1
rather , it 's a party with leaders as diverse as the country it intends to represent			1
with the nation 's changing demographics , @entity10 can no longer rely on the @entity18 and @entity19 to carry them to victory in 2012			1
instead , they must broaden their base into traditionally purple and blue states			2
it 's an uphill battle : president @entity25 leads by a sizeable margin with women and by wide margins with @entity30 and black voters			2
but it 's not insurmountable			0
@entity32 already leads with men by roughly the same number president @entity25 leads with women			0
republicans won a landslide victory in the 2010 fall midterm elections			0
now they must devise a strategy to repeat that			0
republicans , in short , must repeat what they did in their landslide victory in the 2010 fall midterm elections			0
opinion : unfriendly to women ? not my @entity10 bolstered by the rise of the @entity48 , @entity10 won back the @entity49 in historic fashion then			1
independents went to @entity10 by 15 points , an incredible 23 - point swing from 2008			1
republicans virtually eliminated the gender gap with women -- their best showing since 1982			0
writing in @entity59 this week , @entity58 notes , " white noncollege voters and white evangelical @entity61 were only 42 % and 37 % , respectively , of the winning @entity2 coalition in the 2010 congressional elections			1
" 2010 was a watershed year for @entity10 because they were able to lure away much of the @entity65 base , particularly @entity66 and @entity19 suburbanites and college graduates			1
they did so by campaigning on major policy issues and reforms , such as @entity71 and the national debt , that inspired and enthused the electorate			0
as the 2012 @entity10 convention dawns , look for @entity10 to display a similar election strategy : a diverse cast of party leaders with bold policy ideas reaching for a diverse electorate			1
for one of the few times in @entity10 history , the top of the @entity2 ticket hails exclusively from the @entity84 , with @entity32 from @entity85 and @entity86 from @entity87			1
the de facto leaders of the @entity10 bring a newfound party interest in these traditionally blue states			1
already , @entity86 has put @entity87 in play for republicans in some of the latest polls			0
in @entity85 , which president @entity25 won by more than 16 points in 2008 , @entity32 trails @entity25 by only 2 points , according to the @entity98 average of polls in @entity85			0
the nation is familiar with the likes of sen. @entity102 of @entity4 and gov. @entity103 , the @entity104 governor , but in @entity3 , viewers will be introduced to a new , even deeper and more diverse cast			1
scheduled to speak tuesday night is @entity107 , @entity2 candidate for @entity108 in @entity109			1
the son of a @entity112 immigrant , @entity107 rose to attend @entity113 and @entity114 , becoming a gifted orator			2
as the solicitor general of @entity109 , he argued and won high - profile cases in front of the @entity119			0
also speaking on tuesday night is @entity120 , the first female governor in @entity121 and the daughter of @entity124 immigrants			2
she made her name as governor fighting the @entity25 administration 's @entity128 lawsuit challenging @entity131 's right to build a new plant in @entity121			0
the @entity128 dropped the suit after the union reached an agreement with @entity131			0
the plant could bring thousands of jobs to her state			0
opinion : @entity10 -- big tent , or big mess ? with the reshuffled convention schedule , also speaking tuesday will be @entity142 , the mayor of @entity143 , @entity144 , and candidate for the 4th @entity146 there			1
@entity142 , the first black female mayor in @entity144 state history , is already making a name for herself with her outspoken , firebrand conservatism			2
@entity151 , the first female governor of @entity152 and the first female @entity30 governor in @entity155 history , is set to take the stage wednesday night			0
more important than diversity , however , is substance , and this year 's crop of @entity2 leaders is a bolder , more conservative group than we 've seen in decades			1
after paying a steep price at the polls in 2006 and 2008 , the @entity10 might be in a new era in 2012 , one ripe with intrepid , limited government and constitutional reformers such as @entity169			2
@entity170 of @entity87 , @entity171 of @entity172 , @entity173 of @entity174 and rep. @entity86 , now the vice presidential nominee			0
the purpose of a convention , after all , is to coalesce individuals into parties and ideas into causes			0
with the selection of @entity86 for vice president , the race takes on clear shape and focus -- repealing @entity71 , restoring fiscal sanity and jump - starting the economy -- that voters can rally for , rather than just rallying against president @entity25			0
for all the hand - wringing and second - guessing in the @entity2 primaries , the post-convention @entity10 will take on a new , united face			1
the goal , inevitably , is to replicate the results of the @entity10 's 2010 landslide victory			1
but to do that , it must replicate the same vision , clarity and diversity , not for diversity 's sake , but for the sake of the wide swath of @entity155 's voters in need of help			2
look for the @entity10 to harness , focus and refine that message all week in @entity3			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

@entity211 : @entity10 convention will demonstrate the party is as diverse as the nation
he says since 2010 vote brought *people* who traditionally vote @entity65 toward @entity10
he says speakers at convention -- @entity120 , @entity107 , @entity142 -- show party 's diversity
@entity211 : new crop of @entity2 leaders is bolder , more conservative than past
