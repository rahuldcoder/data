" i 've got things i do n't want people to know but i did n't really go running for cover for a new way to encrypt			0
" the comedian gave the closing keynote at the @entity6 conference , ignoring requests from privacy activists and some members of the cybersecurity community to back out of the event			1
a number of security speakers dropped out of the @entity6 conference when @entity25 reported in december that @entity6 had an undisclosed $ 10 million contract with the @entity3 to build a back door for the government agency into encryption software			1
some protesters put on a counter-conference nearby thursday called @entity32 , and protesters passed out @entity35 information outside of a conference location in downtown @entity0			0
though he is not a security expert , @entity2 's reaction was closely watched by those outside of the community			1
@entity6 typically closes out its week - long conferences with big - name speakers , often from the political sphere			2
@entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 have all held the honor at previous conferences			0

many of you see me as a champion of privacy , " said @entity2			2
" which i know because i read your emails			0
" @entity2 was quick to defend @entity6 and his decision to keep the paid gig			1

@entity2 asked if it was fair to boycott this conference when other major companies such as @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 had all been linked to the @entity3			1
he also joked that as a freedom lover , he does n't engage in boycotts			0
and that he had signed a contract so his conscience was clear , as long as his check cleared			0
while the @entity6 got a pass , @entity2 did n't go as easy on the @entity3 or @entity83 , whom he referred to as " practically a war criminal " for taking top secret @entity86 intelligence to @entity87 and then to @entity88			1
" was @entity89 not accepting asylum requests ? " he quipped			0
the lines between the blustering right - leaning character @entity2 plays on tv and the more liberal comedian himself were fluid during the talk , but he seemed genuine in his criticisms of the agency and its famous whistleblower			1
" we can trust the @entity3 because without a doubt it is history 's most powerful , pervasive , sophisticated surveillance agency ever to be totally pwned by a 29 - year - old with a thumb drive , " said @entity2			1
the rest of the talk was a mix of jokes and light political commentary , with some security humor thrown in to appease the cryptographer audience			2
he joked about his own fictional security startup , @entity113 , and took questions from the audience about " @entity116 , " @entity117 , acting and politics			0
in the end , the comedian placed the blame for the @entity3 's programs on @entity86			1
" we all deserve credit for this new surveillance state that we live in because we the people voted for the @entity126			0
democrats and @entity128 alike , " said @entity2			2
" we voted for the people who voted for it , and then voted for the people who reauthorized it , then voted for the people who re- re-authorized it			0
