-- they stepped forward to help reform the way football 's world governing body @entity6 operates - and are now bitterly regretting their decision			1
two female whistle - blowers gave evidence to @entity12 lawyer @entity11 , who over 18 months investigated the bidding process of the 2018 and 2022 @entity14			1
the women claim @entity11 ensured they would have anonymity in his investigative report -- and that he broke his promise			0
it 's a report that has become mired in controversy after @entity22 judge @entity21 -- @entity6 's independent ethics adjudicator -- published a summary of the evidence the @entity12 had collated			1
" our cooperation was facilitated by mr @entity11 's repeated promises - made privately to us and also in public - to ensure the confidentiality of his witnesses , " said @entity26 and @entity27 in a joint statement			1
" he said the report would not be published ; that only four people would see it ; and that the identities of the people he spoke with -- other than current serving football officials or employees -- would remain confidential			0
" this was a crucial element behind our decision to cooperate , as we are private citizens and no longer protected by the legal and pr functions of wealthy football federations			0
" assurances the two women insist that assurances were given to them both in private and public that they would not be compromised after agreeing to give evidence " through a sense of natural justice and a desire to bring closure to a long running chapter in our lives			0
" the women were not identified by name , but they contend they were " clearly identifiable " in @entity21 's summary			2
@entity11 's office declined to respond to @entity0 's request for a response to the women 's statement , while @entity6 has said its disciplinary committee will investigate the duo 's claims			1
former head of corporate affairs in the @entity71 2022 bid , @entity26 told @entity0 that @entity11 - @entity6 's independent ethics investigator -- made a verbal promise to her " more than once " that the report would not be published			1
in september @entity11 said for the first time that his report should be made public with redactions			2
soon after its publication , @entity11 said the 42 - page summary contained " numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations			2
" according to @entity6 , @entity11 and @entity21 are due to meet on thursday to discuss their differences			2
the bidding process surrounding the 2018 and 2022 events has become a lightning rod for criticism of the way @entity6 is run			1
the organization had hoped the report 's publication would put in an end to the intensive scrutiny @entity6 has faced			1
but @entity11 's negative reaction to @entity21 's summary and the two whistleblowers ' subsequent complaints make that seem unlikely			1
in a statement , @entity6 told @entity0 that " any potential breach of confidentiality committed by a member of the @entity103 should be examined by the @entity104			0
" it added : " we can not prejudice any decision that said @entity103 could take in this or any similar situation			0
however , names of witnesses have not been disclosed in the statement of the chairman of the @entity112 of the @entity103 to protect their personality rights			0
" furthermore , the discussion and the public letter by @entity27 and @entity26 underline exactly the confidentiality issue concerning any of the witnesses when talking about a publishing of the full report			0
" @entity21 's report cleared @entity121 and @entity122 , who will stage the 2018 and 2022 events respectively , of wrongdoing and instead was critical of rival bidders @entity127 and @entity71			1
however on @entity21 's recommendation , @entity6 lodged a criminal complaint with the @entity131 judiciary on tuesday in relation to bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity14			1
unmasked @entity26 says she was not notified before the summary into the report was published , claiming the first she knew about it was last friday after @entity6 released the document			2
" the summary by @entity146 clearly breached all such assurances of confidentiality , " added the statement from @entity139 and @entity140 , who was in charge of international media relations for the @entity122 bid until 2010			0
" although not named in the report , we were clearly identifiable and within hours of its publication had been widely unmasked as the ' whistle - blowers ' in @entity22 , @entity155 and @entity156 media			0
" to compound this situation @entity146 used his summary report to question our credibility			2
this is particularly puzzling as the summary simultaneously uses the same information we provided to form significant parts of his inquiry in respect of the @entity156 and @entity122 bids			0
" according to @entity26 , @entity11 told her that @entity6 's @entity168 did not allow for reports to be published			1
confidentiality earlier this year @entity6 's legal director @entity170 told reporters that witness confidentiality for @entity11 's work could prove difficult to sustain if the report was published			1
" the code of ethics is based on certain principles , one of which is confidentiality , " said @entity170			0
" cooperation between witnesses and the ethics committee is based on confidentiality -- if not perhaps certain witnesses , whistle blowers or other parties might not cooperate to such an extent			0
" since @entity21 's findings were made public , @entity6 has faced a barrage of criticism over the way the entire episode has been handled			2
last week @entity193 , president of the @entity194 , warned that @entity196 's 54 member nations could leave @entity6 if the report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 was not published in full			1
his remarks came just before the @entity200 demanded @entity6 hand over a copy of the report , while @entity204 , chairman of the @entity205 warned that " urgent action " must be taken to restore confidence in the world governing body .			0
