a gleaming , modern airport terminal reduced to shattered concrete and twisted metal			2
charred cars in the parking garage			2
the sound of artillery shells exploding nearby			2
these are the sights and sounds that @entity1 's @entity10 observed in and around the besieged city of @entity12 in eastern @entity13			1
six months ago , @entity12 's once proud @entity14 was still in use			0
but the worsening conflict between @entity13 forces and @entity19 separatists in eastern @entity13 has transformed it into a scene of devastation -- a symbol of the wider destruction that 's left the @entity12 region reeling			1
civilians are increasingly falling victim to the fighting , with at least 224 killed and more than 540 others injured in the final three weeks of january , the @entity27 high commissioner for human rights said tuesday			1
the fighting has been among the fiercest in decades in @entity32			1
in @entity36 , about 45 miles northeast of the city of @entity12 , a stream of civilians has fled the shelling			2
the town has been the scene of bloody conflict in recent days as separatist forces seek to surround @entity13 troops			1
a morgue in nearby @entity44 is full with the bodies of fighters and civilians who did n't make it to safety in time			2
there , @entity1 's @entity10 saw one soldier torn in half , placed in a body bag			0
morgue staff who said they 'd seen 200 bodies in the past month were working 24 hours a day to try to keep up with the number coming in			0
in @entity36 , some civilians sought refuge underground in the basement of a building			2
but after a shell hit it , leaving a gaping hole in its side , they , too , fled			0
some who spoke to @entity1 after evacuating to @entity66 aboard ramshackle buses say their politicians have failed them			0
@entity69 , who gave his name as @entity71 , told @entity1 , " me , personally , i 'll take any ruler , just do n't kill me			0
all i want is bread and salt , just do n't kill me			0
" a woman sitting next to him said , " we 're hostages of the situation			0
" @entity71 added , " @entity80 politics is interested in killing simple people			0
they shoot and shoot and kill us			0
" the sense of anger is growing in @entity44 , where a group of women gathered in the town center despite the cold and rain to protest against the war			0
@entity13 's army is so underfunded that its politicians are hamstrung , but that has not exempted them from blame for the suffering of local people			1
" we use snow to clean ourselves , " said one young woman , clearly emotional			0
" and our new president did n't do anything			0
" another woman said , " when they bombed one town , i waited until 5 in the evening , just to move my 2 - year - old granddaughter to the train			0
the @entity13 army bombed us because separatists were there			1
" meanwhile , the road to @entity36 still heaves with @entity13 armor as the government seeks to hold off the separatists ' advance			1
@entity116 and the @entity117 accuse @entity118 of sending military personnel and equipment across the border into @entity13 to bolster the separatist forces			1
the conflict 's total death toll since mid-april , including combatants and civilians , is now at least 5,358 -- an increase of 272 in less than two weeks -- with another 12,235 injured , the @entity27 said tuesday			1
forces indiscriminately shelled residential areas in government - controlled territories such as @entity36 and @entity135 and rebel - held cities such as @entity12 and @entity138 as fighting escalated last month , @entity130 said			2
" bus stops and public transport , marketplaces , schools and kindergartens , hospitals and residential areas have become battlegrounds in the @entity12 and @entity150 regions of @entity13 -- in clear breach of international humanitarian law which governs the conduct of armed conflicts , " the high commissioner said in a statement			1
last month 's most deadly single incident involving civilians occurred in the southeastern city of @entity158 when two attacks involving multiple - launch rocket systems killed at least 31 people and injured 112 others , the @entity27 said			1
" any further escalation will prove catastrophic for the 5.2 million people living in the midst of conflict in eastern @entity13 , " the high commissioner said			1
the @entity27 official called on nations with influence in the region to pressure the combatants to return to a ceasefire agreement reached in september in @entity174 , @entity175 -- a deal that eroded long ago			1
his office also expressed concern about " the implications of the harsh winter months on civilians in conflict - affected areas , with shortages of food and water and power cuts			2
" as the situation deteriorates , the @entity186 is considering sending lethal aid to help the @entity13 government fend off attacks from @entity19 rebels in eastern @entity13 's @entity12 and @entity150 regions			1
this assistance would come in the form of so - called defensive lethal aid , which could include anti-tank , anti-air and anti-mortar systems			0
the @entity198 first reported the possible change in policy , saying @entity202 commander gen. @entity201 is in support of the new lethal assistance , and that secretary of state @entity205 ; gen. @entity206 , chairman of the @entity208 ; and national security adviser @entity209 are all open to considering the idea			0
a @entity186 official told @entity1 that military leadership supports defensive lethal aid being part of the discussion , but the administration is still trying to assess what reaction it could elicit from the @entity118 government , which the @entity186 maintains is backing rebels in eastern @entity13 .			1
