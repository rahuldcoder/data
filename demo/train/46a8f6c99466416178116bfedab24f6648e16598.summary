-- fresh off the news that it 's reached a huge milestone -- 1 billion users -- facebook on thursday rolled out a video comparing the social network to other things that bring people together			1
the video , posted by ceo @entity14 and other @entity4 brass on their pages , came as the site announced it had reached 1 billion accounts that are active at least once a month			1
it took the social media juggernaut six years to hit 500 million and only another two to double that			0
@entity14 said the video , titled " @entity23 , " is the first time @entity4 has ever created a " brand video " and that it is designed " to express what our place is on this @entity27			1
" " we believe that the need to open up and connect is what makes us human , " he wrote			2
" it 's what brings us together			0
it 's what brings meaning to our lives			0
" the 90 - second video takes the unlikely tack of comparing the site , famously birthed in @entity14 's @entity42 dorm room , to everyday items			1
it begins with the image of a red chair levitating in a forest , but quickly moves on to show other chairs being used as children play and adults rest , dance and chat			0
" chairs are made so that people can sit down and take a break , " the narrator says over a stirring musical arrangement			2
" anyone can sit on a chair			0
and if the chair 's large enough , they can sit down together and tell jokes , or make up stories or just listen			0
" @entity71 , airplanes and bridges " are things people use to get together so they can open up and connect about ideas and music and other things people share , " the narrator continues			1
in a universe that can make us feel alone , " maybe the reason we make all these things is to remind ourselves that we are not , " the video concludes			2
marketing analysis site @entity78 reported that @entity4 does n't plan to air the ad on television , instead using it on its own advertising platforms and a website that anyone can visit			1
while it 's a celebration of the milestone , @entity4 also clearly hopes the ad will help attract its next billion users			1
@entity4 plans to advertise in 13 markets -- the @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			0
" we 're creating this for our users , but we think it 's a message that will be interesting and relevant to non-users as well , " @entity104 , @entity4 's head of consumer marketing , told the site			2
" we feel like we need to be respectful and introduce ourselves and to say ' this is what we believe in ' and ' come on board			0
