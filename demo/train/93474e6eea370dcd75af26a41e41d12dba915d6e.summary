-- thousands of people are planning viewing parties for the upcoming annular solar eclipse , a rare event in which the sun will appear as a thin ring behind the moon			1
the eclipse will begin over @entity10 on monday morning , when it will be visible in southern @entity11 and southern @entity12			1
in the @entity14 , the eclipse will be visible on a path from northwestern @entity16 through @entity17 , northeastern @entity18 , southern @entity19 , @entity20 , northern @entity21 and southwestern @entity22 late sunday			1
" i recommend anyone who has the chance to see this , because while they do happen occasionally , it 's a fairly rare event , " said @entity23 , a solar physics specialist with @entity25			0
" it 's a neat thing to see			0
" during an annular eclipse , the moon does not block the entirety of the sun , but leaves a bright ring of visible light at the edges , according to @entity25			1
" for the may eclipse , the moon will be at the furthest distance from @entity43 that it ever achieves -- meaning that it will block the smallest possible portion of the sun , and leave the largest possible bright ring around the outside , " the agency said on its website			1
the last annular eclipse appeared in the @entity14 in 1994			1
the next solar eclipse will be on november 13 , and is expected to be visible over northern @entity51 , according to @entity25			1
in western @entity14 , more than 1,000 people may flood the small town of @entity54 , @entity19 -- population 300 -- to get one of the best views of sunday 's event , said @entity59 , spokeswoman for the @entity61 - @entity60			1
the town is calling the eclipse " the ring of fire			1
" the @entity65 in @entity19 is opening its ski lift so people can watch the eclipse from atop a mountain peak of more than 11,000 feet			2
for $ 8 , visitors will get a ride up the mountain and solar glasses , @entity59 said			2
and instead of football fans , the @entity75 's @entity74 will be occupied by astronomy enthusiasts on sunday			0
" in order to provide the best viewing angles , attendance for the event is limited to 13,000 inside the stadium , " the university said on its website			0
the whole eclipse will last for a couple of hours as the moon passes in front of the sun , creating a partial eclipse			1
the actual annular portion , in which the sun appears as a thin ring , will be about four minutes long , @entity23 said			1
more than 80 % of the sun will be blocked out during the apex , he said			1
outside of the eclipse 's narrow path of less than 200 feet ( 61 meters ) , people will be able to see only a partial eclipse			2
" this will cause less change in the daylight than you might think , " said @entity100 , a senior editor at @entity101			0
" moderately thin clouds would dim the sunlight more			2
and if you 're where the eclipse is only partial , the dimming will be less			2
" @entity23 said people should not peer up at the sky to view the solar event without special viewing equipment			0
looking at the sun with the naked eye can cause blindness			2
@entity120 glasses , dark welder 's goggles or an astronomer 's filter made for sun viewing are recommended if people want to look skyward			1
another way to view the eclipse is by using binoculars and telescopes to project an image of it on the ground , @entity23 said			0
point the binoculars or telescopes at the sun -- without looking through the lenses -- and aim the other end onto a piece of paper or cardboard			0
in northern @entity19 , " ecliptomaniacs " are planning to travel south to view the event , said @entity143 , a @entity25 ambassador in @entity144			0
he said astronomy club members " realize they could either drive four hours to see the eclipse or wait 11 years for the next one			0
" @entity148 said he always looks forward to seeing people 's reactions to an eclipse			0
" you get everything from stoic , staring into the sky ... to people breaking down and crying , they 're just so moved , " he said			0
planning to view the eclipse ? share your photos with @entity159 and they could be featured on @entity0			0
