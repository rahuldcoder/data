-- if you 've thrown a birthday party recently , you might have personally experienced the shortages or price hikes intermittently hitting the helium market			1
unfortunately , balloon customers are not the only ones being affected			0
many helium users , from scientists to manufacturers in a number of industries , have experienced the negative impact of helium shortages and rising prices			1
if steps are n't taken to develop and put into place a long - term strategy for managing this valuable and non-renewable resource , things can get worse			1
everyone has benefited , to some degree , from research made possible by liquid helium			1
cell phones , @entity26 and laptops are possible because of experiments enabled by liquid helium			2
in the medical world , magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity31 ) is but one example of a host of diagnostic and treatment tools that exist only as a result of groundbreaking experiments carried out by using helium			2
in fact , the strong and extremely stable magnetic field that @entity31 devices require to work is accomplished by immersing powerful superconducting magnets inside liquid helium			2
manufacturers of fiber optics cable and semiconductors used in electronic components rely on helium			2
and these are just a few examples of the importance of helium			2
those who are particularly hard hit are members of the scientific community			1
an interruption in helium supply can cause weeks or even months of work to become useless			2
for many of these researchers , helium costs are a significant fraction of their operating budgets			0
the large increases in helium prices that they have experienced over the last few years have placed them in a tight financial bind			0
opinion : do n't deflate the party so , is there anything that can be done ? one of the main causes of the current shortage is the nature of the helium market itself			0
@entity76 , unlike most other gases , is a minor byproduct in the production of natural gas			0
those fissures and crevices that have trapped natural gas below the @entity84 's surface are also capable of trapping helium , although typically in small amounts			1
it takes a certain minimum level of helium concentration to make it economically viable to separate out the helium from the natural gas			0
as a consequence , out of the thousands of sources of natural gas that exist , only 14 are being processed for their helium content			0
and when more than a few of those helium sources are shut down for maintenance and repair , as they have been over the last few months , helium shortages can occur			1
decades ago , the @entity104 established the @entity105 to provide a readily available supply of helium for defense , space , and scientific research needs			1
the reserve , located in the @entity113 panhandle , is the only long - term substantial storage source for helium in the world			1
in the 1960s and 1970s , the @entity104 bought and stored significant amounts of helium there			0
in 1996 , @entity121 directed the @entity122 , the agency in charge of the @entity124 , to sell off helium in order to recoup some of the costs associated with its purchase			0
under current law , those sales are to be completed by the beginning of 2015 , less than two years away			0
right now , the helium being sold by @entity122 accounts for more than 30 % of the helium sold worldwide			0
once @entity122 ends its sales of helium as required by current law , the impact on the availability and price for helium is expected to be significant			0
at the request of @entity122 , the @entity141 studied these issues and made recommendations , including a series of steps to help properly manage the helium reserve for the long term , strategies to protect the most vulnerable of users such as scientists , and ways to develop and implement a plan to protect this very important resource			1
the time is ripe to update the nation 's policies and programs for managing helium			1
if it 's done right , our children will continue to be able to celebrate their birthdays with balloons , and grow up to develop critical new technologies that they 'll need to prosper in the next century			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 and @entity169 .			1

@entity168 , @entity169 : everyone has benefited from research involving helium
@entity168 , @entity175 : we need a long - term strategy for managing this valuable resource
they say the scientific community in particular has been hard hit by helium shortages
@entity168 , @entity175 : the time is ripe to update the nation 's policies for managing helium
