-- it has all the right ingredients for a tense situation : scorching hot weather			2
sidewalks , subways and hotels packed to capacity			2
but instead of being a pressure cooker , downtown @entity13 , @entity14 , is serving up a huge party			1
@entity17 finds the city of @entity13 host to several well - attended events , including @entity21 , @entity23 's season opening football game , the @entity25 and @entity26			1
the weekend 's two largest events , @entity28 and the @entity29 , happen only a few blocks away from each other , essentially taking over the downtown area			1
@entity13 's long - established science fiction and fantasy convention @entity28 and @entity34 's college football extravaganza are the strangest of bedfellows			1
event organizers and attendees readily admit that three years ago , the first pairing of @entity28 and the kickoff game was as an awkward , giggly mashup of @entity44 and face - painted alumni			1
but all are quick to point out that it did n't take long for fans to foster an enthusiastic weekend of unabashed celebration and mutual respect			2
" it 's kind of like the ultimate pop culture weekend , " said @entity51 , a digital marketing consultant			2
" where else can you find a place full of sci - fi and fantasy fans next to beer - guzzling football fans , all decked out in their school colors ? it 's like everyone 's in costume for the weekend			1
" but i think at the end of the day it 's just a lot of people getting excited about what they love and coming together to celebrate it with other people who love the same thing , " she said			0
" i do n't know that there 's so much of a difference , except that we 'll all be wearing @entity77 and they 'll all be wearing costumes			0
" the @entity80 will be playing @entity81 in the big game			0
@entity83 , a chemist and @entity28 attendee , says it 's not always easy for the two groups to get along , but there 's enough room for everyone			1
" i think they are as amicable as possible with each other , " @entity83 said			0
she says that three years on , @entity28 attendees are more accepting of the football fans and are joining in during the buildup toward the game			1
" they 're more willing to say ' @entity98 ! ' or ' @entity99 ! ' or ' @entity100 ! ' which you 'll hear a lot of this weekend , " she said			2
as early as thursday night , people dressed in @entity105 garb were checking into hotels next to people dressed in purple and gold or @entity111 blue			0
and the organizers of the two events are digging the vibe			2
" the truth is , most of @entity28 attendees have a college football preference			1
it 's not the old style stereotype of someone who 's reading comic books and avoiding sports or not caring about sports , it 's someone who 's reading comic books while they 're watching sports			0
i 've had a running e-mail chain for weeks with the chairman of @entity28 about @entity130 versus @entity131 , " said @entity28 spokesman @entity127			1
@entity133 president and ceo @entity132 sent an open invitation to @entity28 attendees for exactly that reason			1
" we 've reached out to them this year to say , ' hey , you have your parade , if you want to come down to @entity141 [ for the @entity143 broadcast prior to the @entity29 ] let 's get the groups together and see what happens here , ' " @entity132 said			1
" i actually know they 'll be getting a lot of takers , " @entity127 said			0
" we do have a group that 's all ready to go right after the parade			0
a lot of people [ will be ] in costume , and we 're going to be going over to @entity143 , to their @entity157 area by the stadium , and just getting to meet some of the football fans			1
" sometimes called " comic con 's little brother , " but fiercely defended by attendees as the country 's most fan - oriented convention , @entity28 had more than 30,000 preregistered guests as of thursday night , @entity127 said			1
celebrities on the @entity169 circuit anticipate an attendance closer to 70,000 people this year , based on over-packed hotel rooms and local visitors			0
" it 's not intimate			0
it 's not a small convention , " @entity83 said			0
because it 's so massive , @entity28 attendees need to prepare , @entity83 said			1
" first thing on my list , a good pair of shoes			0
" you definitely need to bring your patience			0
there are long lines , there 's a lot of people , you definitely need to fight your way through crowds			0
and you need to bring something nerdy , " she said			0
@entity83 suggests wearing a t - shirt with a nerdy quote on it ( like one from " @entity197 " that says " @entity198 , " or " @entity199 " ) or a costume			2
bringing food can also be advantageous for long lines , she said			0
this year the convention spans four of downtown 's largest hotels			2
sharing some of those packed rooms will be the close to 20,000 @entity81 and @entity80 fans in town for the @entity29			1
@entity132 said they are still selling tickets and hopes this year will be another sold - out game .			0
