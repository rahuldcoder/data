@entity0 -- in the most extensive reshaping of the @entity8 administration 's national security team to date , the president will name @entity10 director @entity9 as his nominee to succeed @entity12 as defense secretary , top @entity3 officials said wednesday			1
gen. @entity15 will be nominated to take over as @entity10 director , and lt. gen. @entity17 will succeed @entity15 as head of the @entity3 - led international military force in @entity20 , a senior administration official told reporters			1
in addition , longtime diplomat @entity23 will be nominated as the next @entity3 ambassador to @entity20 , the official said			2
president @entity8 will formally announce the changes on thursday , according to the senior administration official			1
it is the biggest reshaping of @entity8 's national security team since he took office in january 2009 and reflects a longstanding plan by @entity12 to step aside this year			1
more changes also are coming			0
both adm. @entity33 , chairman of the @entity35 , and fbi director @entity36 are not eligible for renomination for terms that expire this year			0
@entity39 will resign effective june 30 , assuming @entity9 gets confirmed by @entity40 in time and is ready to start on july 1 , according to an administration official and a congressional aide familiar with phone calls @entity12 was making to legislators and senior staff members			1
@entity15 will remain in command in @entity20 until @entity17 is ready to take over at the beginning of september , officials said , which could require an interim @entity10 director if @entity9 moves to the defense secretary 's office as planned on july 1			1
in addition , @entity15 will resign from the military once confirmed so that he serves as a civilian @entity10 director , officials said			1
initial reaction from @entity40 was positive , with key legislators on intelligence and security issues praising both @entity9 and @entity15 as good choices			1
" the sum total of these picks is that the president has chosen experienced people with unique capabilities to serve our nation at a dangerous time , " said @entity63 sen. @entity63 of @entity64			0
" this team will provide the leadership to help make our nation safer			2
i could not be more pleased with these selections			0
i hope these nominees receive swift approval by the @entity80			0
" gates was telling legislators and staff members that he recommended @entity9 for his job six months ago , and joked that @entity9 stopped speaking to him for days for doing so , the officials said			1
in addition , @entity12 was saying that @entity17 was a consensus choice to succeed @entity15 , according to the officials			1
it took a meeting with @entity8 to convince @entity9 to accept the job , a source familiar with the discussions told @entity1			1
@entity9 has been happy serving at the @entity10 , but " believes strongly in public service and answering the call from the commander - in - chief , " the source said			1
@entity9 , 72 , took over at the @entity10 in february 2009			1
he served as chief of staff to president @entity100 between 1994 and 1997 , and was previously the director of the @entity102 ( @entity102 )			2
the @entity104 @entity103 served in the @entity105 from 1977 to 1993			0
before coming to the @entity10 , he spent 10 years co-directing a public policy institute with his wife , @entity107			1
he was brought in as a relative outsider , without hands - on intelligence experience , to manage an agency that had been shaken by the exposure and criticism of its controversial interrogation and detention program			0
@entity9 's longstanding ties to @entity40 were seen as a way to restore the administration 's relationship with oversight committees			1
he has been given high marks on both fronts from inside the agency and in @entity40			0
@entity125 , a senior adviser at the @entity126 , said @entity9 brings several important qualities to the table			1
he " learned a lot of lessons " about defense budgeting during his stint as the head of the @entity102 , and knows how to deal with a @entity40 , as he did during the @entity100 administration , @entity125 said			0
@entity9 's former congressional district in northern @entity104 had a huge defense presence , @entity125 said			1
@entity9 has earned the trust and confidence of @entity8 as leader of the @entity10 , and has name recognition , which is important , @entity125 said , adding : " it 's a name @entity3 recognize			1
filling @entity12 ' shoes is really going to be a tough job			2
" @entity125 said the president 's choice of @entity15 to lead the @entity10 indicates that @entity8 is interested in his national security views and efforts and it " indicates that the president cares about the way all those pieces fit together			1
" earlier this month , @entity15 took a highly unusual step for a military officer when he publicly acknowledged the possibility of being in contention for a presidential appointment			1
" it 's probably not appropriate for me to comment on whatever might be considered down the road , " he told reporters in @entity157 when asked about the possible @entity10 nomination			1
" i 've had discussions , but again , it would n't be appropriate to comment			0
" @entity15 , 58 , assumed command of the @entity164 ( @entity165 ) and @entity3 @entity20 on july 4 , 2010 , after serving for more than 20 months as commander of @entity167			1
he previously commanded multi-national forces in @entity169 , leading the so - called " surge			0
" during his time commanding the @entity171 and @entity172 , he oversaw the development of the @entity175 / @entity174			0
@entity23 has served previously as @entity3 ambassador to @entity169 and to @entity177 , while @entity17 became deputy commander of @entity167 in july 2008			0
@entity12 is the only @entity179 member from the previous administration to stay on when @entity8 came into office			2
president @entity182 nominated @entity12 as the nation 's 22nd secretary of defense in december 2006 to replace @entity185 , one of the architects of the @entity187 who was facing widespread criticism			2
gates did not expect to stay on after @entity182 's presidency ended			2
when asked if he would continue under another administration , @entity12 said in 2008 , " i learned a long time ago never to say never , so my answer is : the circumstances under which i would do that are inconceivable to me			0
" but those circumstances arose			0
in december 2008 , then - president - elect @entity8 expressed a desire for continuity at the @entity198 , given the ongoing conflicts abroad in @entity169 and @entity20			2
" i spent a long time hoping the question would never be popped , " @entity12 admitted the day after @entity8 announced his nomination			2
but , he said , @entity8 " impressed " him			2
it is unclear who may replace @entity36 at the @entity204			0
attorney general @entity205 on tuesday did not rule out @entity36 staying on short - term when his 10 - year term expires in september if a successor has not yet been confirmed			2
@entity36 will leave " hard shoes to fill , " @entity205 said			0
@entity205 said he has been discussing potential nominees with @entity212 officials , including vice president @entity213			0
@entity205 said he believes that if a nominee is selected by may , the administration should have time to get the new director confirmed by august			0
if that timeline slips , however , the @entity36 term would end september 4 , one week before the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the @entity222 and the @entity198			0
@entity36 has often remarked that he barely had a chance to find his desk before the 9/11 attacks occurred , and his entire decade was dominated by the fight against @entity228 and its scattered supporters at home and abroad			0
@entity1 's @entity236 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 contributed to this report .			0
