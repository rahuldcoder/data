@entity0 , @entity1 -- on @entity0 's @entity6 , street vendor and sidewalk philosopher @entity3 leaned on his coin and jewelry cart and waited			1
but the tourists from across the border never rushed into the streets of @entity0 , as it 's often called			1
@entity3 made one sale , to a local resident , in an hour			0
" the business , you can see for yourself , it went down 95 percent , " he said			0
" please tell them , the @entity19 , it 's safe to come here			0
we are all @entity22 , @entity23			0
do you see any problems here ? " a few yards away , there was a donkey painted like a zebra , hitched to a cart full of sombreros , a @entity0 photo opportunity			1
but no smiling tourists stepped into the picture frame			2
visitors have been scared off because at least 18,000 people have been killed in @entity1 since president @entity35 dispatched the army to fight the drug cartels in december 2006			1
@entity0 's grisliest murders include decapitations , dismemberments , dozens of police killings and the deaths of three teenagers at school			1
fear of @entity0 's streets seeps deep into @entity47			1
as groups of 240 students from @entity51 near @entity52 , @entity47 , drove down the coast to do missionary work in @entity55 , @entity1 , none ventured to @entity0			1
the missionaries doing spring break volunteer projects in poor neighborhoods were given a simple edict : do not stop in @entity0 @entity60 kneeled , pounding nails into shingles , on a rooftop of a small house taking shape on a dirt road high above @entity55			1
" to be honest , i was a tiny bit nervous crossing the border , " @entity67 said			2
" i 've been to @entity1 before , but not for service projects			1
but now that i have been here [ @entity55 ] a couple days , i am perfectly comfortable			0
" the @entity51 students are taking precautions as part of their annual @entity77 's @entity76 missionary work			1
" we are staying in a group , " @entity67 explained			0
" we are making sure that i am with someone all the time			0
when we went downtown for dinner , we just paired up and walked around in twos , the buddy system			0
we 're just being smart about it			0
" @entity55 welcomes any business it can get , as its tourism trade has also been choked off by concerns about border violence			1
fortunately , cruise ships still dock in @entity55 's @entity91 , a daily divine arrival that spills cash - carrying tourists onto shore			2
but we saw just two visitors who said they drove over the border to visit @entity55			2
all the other beer - carrying , trinket - buying tourists came from the ship			2
" people are afraid of driving by @entity0 , " said @entity102 and beer manager @entity103			1
" that 's what 's hurting us [ @entity55 ] the most			0
" later , in @entity0 , as the shadows stretched out with the dropping sun , we were approached by a man with an outdated nylon jacket			2
his cheeks were chipped by acne scars			0
the camera was far out of sight			0
" i can help you find whatever you need , " he said			0
" what do you want ? i help people find the good clubs and get dates and more			2
" we told him we were journalists on a story and not interested			0
" oh then pay me , and i will tell you a lot for your story , about everything that goes on here , " the hustler said			0
everything -- did he mean drugs or guns , or both ? we had no intent to find out , kept to our tight travel schedule and drove out of @entity0 to a border crossing just several cars deep			1
more than five years ago , that vehicle line extended so far back into @entity1 , a re-entry at @entity140 , @entity47 , could take hours			2
we zipped through the checkpoint in 10 minutes , another sign that @entity1 's border violence is frightening off @entity19 tourists .			1

at least 18,000 people have been killed since @entity1 army began fighting drug cartels
*college* students doing missionary work during spring break told not to stop in @entity0
light *traffic* at border crossings another sign that border violence is scaring off tourists
