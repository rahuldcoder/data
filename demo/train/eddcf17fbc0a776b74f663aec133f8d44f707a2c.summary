inauguration 2013 : a viewer 's guide the dual events this time were due to a confluence of law and pomp			0
that was not the case four years ago when @entity2 and @entity6 also performed the honor twice			1
during that inaugural , @entity2 and @entity6 fumbled the oath before 1.8 million people			1
it all started when @entity6 recited a seven - word phrase , but @entity2 broke in halfway through and repeated the first three words			1
that seemed to throw @entity6 off , and he proceeded to mix up the order of the words in the next phrase			0
@entity1 senior legal analyst @entity46 reported in his recent book , " @entity48 , " that @entity6 is known for his " superb memory " and had obsessively practiced reciting the words at home for weeks			0
government sources told @entity1 and @entity46 that @entity6 and his staff also e-mailed their own copy of the oath to inauguration organizers weeks earlier			2
13 reasons to follow the inauguration on @entity1 's platforms and nowhere else slash marks were clearly indicated to illustrate how the phrases would be divided and where @entity6 would pause , to ensure the president - elect would be on the same page			0
no one is sure why it happened , but " the oath card never reached anyone on @entity2 's staff , " @entity46 wrote			1
they were concerned enough about the small stumble in the sequencing of words on the inaugural platform that @entity2 and @entity6 went through it again the next day in private in the @entity76 - just to make sure they were square with the @entity20			1
back at the @entity11 four years later , it all went off without a glitch just before noon on sunday			0
with @entity6 waiting in the @entity80 , @entity2 strode in before a small gathering			1
he placed his left hand on a @entity83 belonging to his wife 's family and raised his right hand			0
@entity6 had the card with him and the slash marks identifying where he would pause were clearly visible			2
it all took less than a minute to get through the 35 - word oath			0
@entity2 hugged his wife and daughters , exclaiming : " i did it ! " complete coverage : the 2013 presidential inauguration			0
