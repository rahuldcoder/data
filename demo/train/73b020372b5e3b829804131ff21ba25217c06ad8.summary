the medical center offers smoking cessation classes and has plans to revamp signage throughout their facility			0
@entity18 said the response from focus groups and employees has been " good			2
" " we hope it wo n't mean we will lose good employees , but i have no doubt there are going to be folks we wo n't be able to get			2
from a policy standpoint it 's the right direction for us , " he said			0
but dr. @entity45 , a @entity46 professor of public health , said the policy is an invasion of privacy and keeps qualified medical professionals away			2
" from personal experience as a physician , some of the best nurses happen to be smokers , " @entity45 said			2
" are you willing to hire staff that is not the best qualified simply because you 're trying to make this point about how bad smoking is ? " @entity45 , who is quick to note he supports smoke - free workplaces , said " regulating someone 's private behavior in their own home ... really represents employment discrimination and has nothing to do with qualifications for the job			2
if the hospital is so concerned about health , you can make the exact same argument about overweight people			1
" the rate of smoking among physicians is low , @entity45 said			0
but the rate among nurses is more than 20 percent -- higher than the general population			0

" he felt health care workers should n't be smokers			1

@entity13 hires 5,000 employees a year , @entity112 said			0
those who fail the test can reapply in 90 days			0
" it does make sense if you 're a health care institution , you want everyone to be as healthy as possible , " he said , adding that employees are also given incentives to lose weight			1
hospital officials do n't think the policy affects the quality of employees they hire			1
" @entity108 is a center of excellence and when people apply here they really want to come work at this institution			0
we do n't want smokers			0
it 's not in line with our caregiver mission , " he said			0
industries outside health care have also dabbled in banning smokers from employment			1
@entity16 not only bans smokers from employment , it fires employees who smoke			1
