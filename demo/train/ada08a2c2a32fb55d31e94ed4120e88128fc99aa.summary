" i was almost 10 when i received my shoe box , and it was touching to receive a gift as an orphan , someone people do n't care about , " @entity1 says			1

when they were sent to the orphanage years earlier , they were not allowed to bring any possessions with them			0
birthdays were not celebrated and there were no toys to be found on christmas morning			0
all the two siblings had was each other			0
at times , it was hard for them to see how the tough life at the orphanage affected each other			0
" i would see him fight with other boys and i would run into my room and hope he was ok			0
there were so many fights , " @entity18 said			2
for @entity18 , the shoe box gift came when she needed it the most			1
she was 6 years old when it arrived			0
at that point , she was becoming very angry , finding herself in a lot of fights as well			0
she started believing that she had nothing to fight for			0
" i did not care what happened to me , " @entity18 said			2
" people would want to beat up on me			0
i thought , well that is what life is			0
but when i received the shoe box , i realized that someone did care for me in the world , and i thought that i should live a good life			1
" her shoe box had the simplest items : a small towel , a few toiletries , a coloring book and stickers and a small stuffed animal			1
for @entity18 , these possessions meant she was worth something			1
" i realized you can be anyone you want , that you can control your own life , " @entity18 said			2
four years after receiving those first gifts , @entity70 and @entity18 were adopted by a family in the @entity73			1
as they were adjusting to an @entity73 life , learning @entity77 and a different culture , their new older sister came home from school one day with a shoe box present that she was wrapping for " @entity6			1
" the " @entity6 " program was started in 1993 by @entity83 , a @entity84 international relief group			2
that first year , @entity6 collected 28,000 shoe box gifts			1
since then , the organization has received more than 8 million shoe boxes , which have been shipped to more than 100 countries			1
for this holiday season , they are accepting gifts through december 25 and have created a " @entity93 " online tool , where the gifts can be virtually selected and purchased			0
then a @entity83 volunteer packs and wraps the shoe box gift			1
" i knew how it felt to receive that box , how it changed my life			0
if there is a person right now , a child in trouble , thinking of running away , that box could comfort him			0
that is how i felt , " @entity18 said			2
" i realized i could help others			0
" as @entity18 started her own shoe box to send , she included a coloring book , a toothbrush , hard candy , a ball and a puzzle			1
in @entity21 , she loved puzzles because they would give her a focused activity during the many hours she was alone with her thoughts in the orphanage			1
@entity1 's shoe box had similar items , but he made sure his also included a toy car			1
it brought back memories of the one he received in his shoe box gift			1

i put my love in there and what i thought would comfort them			0
to let them know this is for you			0
you can own something now , " @entity1 said			2
one ingredient requested for every shoe box , whether built online or prepared at home , is a personalized note of encouragement for the child who will receive it			1
@entity18 's note was easy for her to write			2
" i told them about myself , that i received a box , and that i hope this box touches their life			2
i also wrote my address and e-mail in case they ever wanted to reach me , " @entity18 said			2
when @entity1 thinks of a child reading his words of support , he recalls the note he received			2
" i used to think about who sent my box , i wondered what they were like and what they enjoyed doing			0
