-- we 're all know the saying " to be the best , you 've got to learn from the best			1
" and while it might be true that there are plenty of quality regular people out there who can help you refine your game -- ski , fish , dunk , bluff , drive -- it 's nice to get instruction from a legit superstar of the craft			1
but book a session with a big name -- an @entity23 hero , a @entity25 champ , an @entity27 star , a @entity29 winner , a @entity31 legend -- and it 's not ( let 's face it ) just about improving			1
it 's about luxuriating in the experience of doing something -- anything -- under the tutelage of a famous , field - tested elite			2
and , yeah , picking up your game a notch , too , and with you 'll never believe who ... ski with @entity44 ( @entity45 , @entity46 ) in 1994 , olympian @entity44 made history by becoming the first @entity49 alpine skier to win two medals ( a gold and silver ) in the same @entity53 -- before he had a @entity55 game named after him			1
today , when he 's not running rivers or guiding heli - skiing trips in @entity58 , @entity44 avails himself to the intermediate - to - expert skiing public at @entity60 as a ski ambassador			1
for half or full days , groups of up to five can arrange for @entity44 himself to whisk them to some of his favorite spots on the hill			2
included in the deal : field - tested @entity44 ski tips and answers to all those pressing questions only a genial @entity70 champion can answer , e.g. what 's it feel like doing this at over 75 mph ? @entity44 @entity77 with @entity78 , @entity79 , others maybe the @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 have missed out on your athletic services , but that does n't mean you ca n't scrimmage with some of the finest former pros who 've worn their colors			1
customized @entity90 ( coordinated by unique experiences specialist @entity92 ) have put together flag football games with @entity78 and @entity94 , hosted by @entity96 personalities @entity97 ; basketball workshops with @entity79 , @entity99 and other former @entity27 stars ; and opportunities to play in places like the @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 in @entity107 and @entity108 in @entity109			1
most fantasy camps can run up to three days for groups of 10 to 20 , and include interactive game instruction as well as actual game play with pros who are n't here to tackle or taunt you -- but welcome you to the team			1
@entity92 @entity119 you can sit behind the wheel of a 600 - horsepower race car , log lap after blurry lap at an official racing track and then get direct feedback from @entity127 @entity126			2
even if your name is n't @entity129 , that 's a pretty sweet ride			2
the @entity119 offers several stock car racing experiences at hallowed ovals around the country -- from shotgun ride - alongs with expert drivers to a " rookie experience " that lets racing wannabes do eight laps in the driver 's seat of a @entity31 vehicle			2
the premier program -- @entity142 -- is a multi-day event held at revolving locations ( next up : @entity145 , @entity146 , in october 2013 ) that lets groups of 10 to 12 people take hundreds of laps behind the wheel with the @entity151 himself , as well as fellow @entity31 legends like @entity154 and @entity155 , in attendance			2
@entity158 with @entity159 and friends " we will teach you to win like us			1
" so says the @entity163 ( the official poker school of the @entity29 ) , whose roster of pro instructors has collectively pooled more than $ 20 million in winnings , and includes bracelet winners @entity159 , @entity170 and @entity171			1
held on select dates at several metro areas around the @entity49 , the @entity163 's curriculum of classes for every skill level includes its flagship , two - day @entity178 ( featuring proven tournament tactics taught by poker stars ) , a @entity181 ( designed to find and fix your weak spots ) and a @entity184 for when you 're ready to turn this all into your day job			1
recent alumni have included a 2011 @entity189 bracelet winner , a 2010 @entity163 event second place finisher ( $ 375,627 ) and several people cleaning up back home at their neighborhood poker nights			2
@entity195 @entity196 with @entity197 ( @entity198 , @entity199 ) competitive bass fishing groupies need no introduction to @entity25 champ @entity197 , who 's logged nearly three decades of wins and @entity204 finishes on the elite circuit			0
@entity207 and amateur weekend anglers alike can glean one - on - one insights from the legend himself during single - or two - day private structure fishing classes on 780 - acre @entity213 , @entity197 ' bass - filled home waters in eastern @entity199 , near @entity215			0
map reading , lure - gear - and - bait selection and effective gps use all factor into the customized open lake curriculum			0
classes center on structure - fishing techniques , but can also include lessons on flippin ' and pitchin ' , top water and shallow swim baits -- and if terms like these are already too familiar to you , you 're ahead of the game			0
@entity197 provides the tackle , but feel free to bring your own			0
in depth fishing golf with @entity235 ( @entity236 ) @entity235 coached @entity237 for years and has helped other huge names in the sport ( or just plain huge names , including five @entity49 presidents ) analyze and improve their games			1
attend an intensive multi-day golf clinic at the @entity244 of @entity246 's @entity245 and you can take your own game to the next level in the company of @entity235 himself -- no green jacket or @entity255 reservation required			1
three days of instruction with @entity235 and his staff ( two - day clinics are available , too ) include nine - hole and 18 - hole lessons at @entity260 and @entity261 , video swing analysis and four nights at @entity264 on the @entity265			1
you 'll be covering long and short irons , wedge and sand shots , trouble shots , chipping , putting and why , in @entity235 's words , " many people play golf , but few truly understand it			1
" @entity235 adventure photography with @entity274 tapped as one of @entity280 's distinguished " @entity279 " and @entity282 's seven " @entity281 , " @entity277 , @entity276 - based photographer and cinematographer @entity274 is a master of capturing humans of all kinds in their element			1
where can you catch up with an award - winning , page - stopping action photog for @entity301 , outside , @entity296 , @entity295 campaigns and beyond ? at a personalized photography seminar catering to small - ish groups inspired to take better shots of interesting people in beautiful places			0
@entity309 's multi-day @entity307 have taken place in @entity312 's @entity311 , @entity314 's @entity313 and @entity316 's @entity315			0
next stop : @entity318 , @entity276 , in october 2014			0
@entity274 drum with @entity320 / @entity321 ( @entity107 ) ok , so maybe you wo n't be @entity323 in this lifetime			1
that 's not an entirely bad thing , and it does n't mean you ca n't meet up with a famous living drummer in @entity107 to briefly pretend			2
housed in a new facility in @entity332 with a separate wing dedicated solely to drum instruction , the @entity329 ( formerly @entity330 ) offers short - and long - term programs focusing on contemporary rhythm music performance			0
but if you just want an hour or two with some big - name drummer , you can hook up for a master class or private lesson			2
the collective 's recent roster of guest teacher names -- @entity343 ( @entity344 ) , @entity321 ( @entity345 ) , @entity346 ( @entity347 ) and others -- may be exactly the quick boost your fantasy drumming career needs			0

private one - on - one hour sessions with dr. @entity353 can be arranged , with advance notice			0
@entity353 's @entity381 motorcycle race with @entity383 ( @entity384 , @entity105 ) handling a sport bike -- at insane track speeds or in comparably crazy road traffic -- takes guts , confidence and ( hopefully not too hard - earned ) experience			0
track or street riders looking to raise their speed and safety quotients ( simultaneously ! ) can take riding lessons from one of the best in the business -- @entity398 champion @entity383			0
headquartered at @entity399 , @entity383 's long - running @entity400 ( skills and techniques of @entity403 ) employs a staff of pro riders who also visit several other tracks around the country during the warmer months -- including @entity409 's @entity408 , @entity411 ' @entity410 and @entity413 's @entity412			0
