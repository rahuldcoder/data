it 's a welcome sign with a caveat			0
president @entity2 and health secretary @entity3 are urging people to try again on the problem - plagued @entity6 website , insisting it will work better by saturday 's self - imposed deadline to improve its performance from last month 's botched launch			1
meanwhile , the administration has been telling its allies to hold off for now on any campaigns to encourage people to sign up right away so that @entity15 does n't get overwhelmed once again this weekend			1
officials fear another huge surge in volume that the site ca n't handle , which is what occurred around the october 1 launch of new insurance exchanges under @entity2 's signature health care reforms			1
the november 30 target for website improvements " does not represent a relaunch of @entity15 ; it is not a magical date , " said @entity24 , spokeswoman for the federal unit in charge of administering the rollout of the health care reforms			1
" there will be times after november 30th when @entity15 does not function properly			1
" in the latest problem with the website , it will be unable to enroll small businesses online for another year , @entity24 told reporters on a conference call			1
small businesses can enroll in other ways in the special small business system known as @entity44 , but problems with @entity15 have prevented their online enrollment so far			1
it was the third delay of the @entity49 component of the website , this time until november 2014			2
until then , " small businesses will be able to enroll directly in a shop plan through an insurer , agent or broker and can get certified for a tax credit after they enroll , " @entity24 said			1
the @entity6 , known as @entity6 , does n't require companies with fewer than 50 employees to buy insurance for workers , though workers are required to have coverage			2
if employers choose to provide coverage workers , they may qualify for subsidies to reduce their costs			0
" we expect that making direct enrollment , tax credit applications and comparison shopping easier will help to ensure that small businesses can take full advantage of the marketplace and tax credits worth up to 50 % of employee premiums in 2014 , " @entity24 said			1
@entity77 to take up @entity6 contraception case however , the head of the @entity80 complained the delay in online enrollment made it harder for small business owners to get all the information they need to enroll			1
" with this delay , it will also call into question how the small business tax credit is applied , " said @entity86 , the group 's president and ceo			0
" not having the ability to apply electronically will now make this process more confusing , cumbersome and time - consuming for employers			0
" @entity97 opponents of @entity6 pounced on the news , with @entity100 speaker @entity99 urging @entity2 to delay implementation of the entire @entity6			1
" this law has been an absolute disaster , leaving us to ask ' what 's next ? ' " the @entity102 @entity97 said in a statement			0
" if the president wo n't repeal it , he should at least delay the entire law before it wreaks any more havoc on @entity113 families and small businesses , as well as our economy			1
" wednesday 's development came as the @entity2 administration prepared for a potential surge in online enrollment in response to its pledge to have the @entity15 website functioning smoothly for most users by the end of november			1
according to a @entity100 official , the administration suggested at a monday meeting with allies that they not drive traffic to the website in the first week of december , following the november 30 deadline it set for website improvements			1
the administration wants to see how the website does before its supporters launch campaign efforts to boost enrollment , the official said			2
recurring breakdowns , error messages and delays botched the federal web portal rollout , opening the reform effort to new and fierce @entity97 criticism while raising questions about the administration 's ability to manage the health insurance overhaul			0
the @entity97 opposition targets the entire 2010 @entity6 , not just the website woes , as the ultimate example of big government run amok			2
despite the website woes , a new @entity153 / @entity152 poll released wednesday showed a majority of @entity113 believe the current @entity6 problems can be solved , and the figures for overall support and opposition remain little changed from a month ago			2
@entity15 was originally planned to handle 50,000 concurrent users , and will reach that capacity by saturday , the @entity100 official said			1
however , big spikes in traffic -- such as the 200,000 who tried to get on at the same time on october 1 -- would cause users to go into a queue to receive an e-mail advising them when to return , the official said			0
@entity3 : @entity6 website improvements ' on track ' @entity170 , president and founder of @entity173 - based software development company @entity172 , said success for the website would be determined by both the number of users as well as how long they are in the system			1
he compared it to a highway , noting that 50,000 people traveling 60 miles per hour is smooth traffic while the same number going 10 miles per hour is a jam			0
in a conference call tuesday with state and local officials , @entity3 said " we are definitely on track to have a significantly different user experience by the end of this month -- that was our commitment -- than people experienced on october 1			0
" " we 've added hardware , we 've added software ; we 're continuing to work on the parts of the website that were too confusing to people , " she continued , urging the officials " to not hesitate to recommend that people go to @entity15 and get signed up because that experience is currently working much better and it will continue to work much better			2
" @entity2 also urged people to go to the website as part of remarks on the economy he made in @entity205			0
enrollment figures for the first month after the opening of the new health insurance exchanges under @entity6 were much lower than initially expected			2
now some states have reported stronger numbers			0
according to a @entity153 count based on available figures , just a little more than 200,000 people have signed up for new private health insurance under @entity6 -- either through the national system or networks set up in 14 states and the @entity218			2
in addition , more than 370,000 have signed up for @entity220 under state programs expanded through the health care reforms , the @entity153 count shows			0
the enrollment period runs until march 31 and officials have said the target for the first year was seven million people			0
to ensure they have coverage starting on january 1 , consumers must sign up by december 23 , the administration recently announced			0
@entity99 signs up for @entity6 , with government support @entity170 cited december 23 as the most significant deadline , noting that demand would be " huge " because people by nature wait until the last minute to act			2
also wednesday , seven @entity237 senators including some up for re-election next year asked @entity2 to appoint a special health care overseer to ensure continuity in efforts to fix the problems			0
while @entity3 is technically the top administration official overseeing implementation of @entity6 , former @entity100 aide @entity243 was brought in last month to oversee efforts to fix the troubled website			1
@entity247 will become a top economic adviser to @entity2 in january			0
in a letter to the president , sens. @entity250 of @entity251 , @entity252 of @entity253 , @entity254 of @entity173 , @entity255 of @entity256 , @entity250 of @entity257 , @entity258 of @entity259 and @entity260 of @entity173 called for @entity2 to name a successor to @entity243			0
separately , an @entity263 official confirmed the government will go with a new web - hosting contractor , @entity266 , for @entity15 early next year			1
the current contract with @entity268 ends in march			0
the official said the decision to go with a different vendor was made several months before any problems with @entity15 were identified and was unrelated to an outage that struck the site in late october , which the administration blamed on the @entity278 subsidiary			2
the @entity266 contract was signed in july .			0

november 30 not a magic *restart* for @entity15 , official says
saturday is the self - imposed deadline for the @entity6 website to perform better
