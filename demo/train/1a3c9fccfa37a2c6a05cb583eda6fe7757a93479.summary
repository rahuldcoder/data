@entity0 -- the @entity3 's sanctions committee has approved a @entity5 request to unfreeze $ 1.5 billion in @entity7 assets to be used for humanitarian and civilian needs			1
" we felt the need was urgent ; that the ( @entity12 ) had to start paying its bills and to start establishing a track record as a clean , democratic organization , " a senior administration official said			2
the money will start flowing " in a few days , " the official said			2
the money will be allocated in three equal amounts , the @entity18 said in a statement			2
up to $ 500 million will be transferred to international humanitarian organizations ; up to $ 500 million will be transferred to suppliers for fuel and other goods intended for civilian use ; and up to $ 500 million will be transferred to a temporary finanical mechanism established to assist the @entity7 people 's food and other humanitarian needs			1
@entity31 had held up the release , expressing concern that no individual body should yet be declared the sole legitimate authority in @entity7			1
the administration compromised by replacing references to the @entity12 with " relevant @entity7 authorities , " the official said			2
" this money will go toward meeting the needs of the people of @entity7 , " said @entity5 secretary of state @entity40 , in a prepared statement			2
" we urge other nations to take similar measures			2
many are already doing so			2
" she called for the @entity12 to move quickly toward building a democracy " that protects the universal human rights of all its citizens			0
" she added , " there can be no place in the new @entity7 for revenge attacks and reprisals			0
" the @entity5 military is looking at options for delivering humanitarian assistance to @entity7 and helping with the return of refugees			1
a senior @entity5 military official with direct knowledge of the effort said there had been no requests for assistance , but the military was doing " prudent planning " to be prepared if asked			0
@entity5 president @entity70 's policy of ruling out any @entity5 troops on the ground remains in effect , he said , but military officials have indicated military aircraft and ships might deliver aid to airfields and ports			2
the @entity12 , which is expected to function as an interim government , was offering few details about its needs , the official said			2
any @entity5 assistance would likely take place within a broader post-conflict @entity85 effort under a @entity0 umbrella , a senior @entity85 official told @entity1			1
@entity85 military officials have begun planning efforts to be ready if they are asked for help , the senior official said			0
that would include planning for humanitarian aid , air and maritime security , and the possibility of training @entity7 military forces at locations outside the country , the senior official said			1
@entity105 allies such as @entity106 , @entity107 and perhaps others are expected to join in any post-conflict effort in order to keep it from looking like @entity85 nations are running the show , the senior official said			2
meanwhile , the @entity113 -- an alliance of countries -- met thursday in @entity115 to discuss how to help rebuild @entity7 's infrastructure			0
@entity5 assistant secretary of state @entity119 , on the sidelines of the meeting , said the @entity120 was expected to officially " seat " the transitional council at league headquarters in @entity124 on saturday			2
@entity119 said part of the proposed $ 1.5 billion in assets , once unfrozen , will help pay oil bills to keep the electricity on in @entity7			1
@entity18 spokeswoman @entity129 said participants were looking forward to a high - level meeting of allies in @entity133 next week			0
@entity135 will unfreeze about $ 505 million in @entity7 assets that have been held in @entity135 banks , @entity135 prime minister @entity134 said thursday			2
the rebels have already gotten some support			0
@entity140 , chairman of the transitional council , revealed that @entity141 had sent $ 300 million to the rebels since july			2
the expected release of financing for humanitarian aid came as a few signs appeared on the streets of the capital that indicated a lessening of tensions in some neighborhoods			1
for the first time in days , a few stores opened and more residents were out on the streets			0
but fighting continued in pockets as the rebels hustled to consolidate power and much of the city remained a no - go zone			2
weapons littered the streets in some areas			2
around one intersection , a dozen bodies lay on the ground , their hands bound behind them			0
rebels said they had been executed by @entity171 's men , but that was not clear			1
the victims were black @entity174 , who composed a large part of @entity171 's army , raising the specter of the revenge killings that @entity179 has cautioned against			1
the opposition has posted a $ 1.4 million bounty for @entity171 's capture or death			1
though he has n't been reported seen since rebel forces began advancing last weekend into the @entity7 capital , he appeared to have issued another audio message in which he exhorted his followers to fight for control of the capital			1
" @entity192 is for you , men and women , " the speaker said			1
" go out , go out and free @entity192			1
destroy them wherever they are , fight them			0
let the crowds from everywhere march to @entity192			1
" the speaker added , " @entity7 is for you " and not for @entity203 or its president , @entity204			0
@entity203 is a leader in the @entity85 mission in @entity7			0
" do not leave @entity192 for the rats , do not leave them			1
fight them , destroy them			0
you are the overwhelming majority , you have marched in millions			0
march with the same millions but fight this time			0
fill the streets and the fields , " the speaker said			0
@entity171 has previously described his adversaries as rats			1
" do not be afraid of bombing , you will not be hit			0
do not be afraid at all			0
they are just stun grenades to scare you			0
do not be afraid at all , do not surrender @entity192			1
" @entity1 can not independently confirm who was speaking in the recording			0
special forces from @entity224 , @entity203 , @entity107 and @entity106 -- on the ground in @entity7 -- have stepped up operations in support of the rebels in @entity192 and other cities			1
but a senior opposition official said much of the capital 's southern neighborhoods remained dangerous			0
" we have 80 % of @entity192 liberated , " said @entity233 , the coordinator of the rebels ' brigades in @entity192			1
" the two suburbs of @entity238 and @entity239 remain contested and fierce fighting with @entity171 forces continues			1
" witnesses told @entity1 that fighting between rebels and @entity171 loyalists erupted thursday at the embattled leader 's compound , the scene of a number of clashes in recent days			1
a giant plume of smoke rose from the compound in @entity254 two days after it was seized by rebels			0
rebels controlled @entity192 's international airport , but were struggling to secure an area east of it			1
@entity171 loyalists destroyed an empty @entity7 airline passenger plane parked at the airport thursday -- the third plane destroyed in 24 hours			1
" the @entity192 airport is under the control of the rebels , but it is still being shelled by @entity171 forces with @entity268 missiles , " @entity233 said			1
@entity85 is trying to learn how many surface - to - air missiles and launchers may still be operational inside @entity7 and who controls them , a @entity85 official told @entity1 thursday			0
several months ago , the @entity5 military estimated @entity7 had an arsenal of 20,000 @entity275 , but it was not clear how many may have been destroyed during the conflict and who has control of the remaining missiles			0
the @entity18 's @entity129 also said the 10 tons of mustard gas stored at the @entity282 in @entity7 are secure " inside massive steel containers within heavy bunkers			0
" but @entity129 also referred to discussions with the transitional council about taking over external security of the facility , raising the question about who is now watching over them			0
a @entity5 official said the same @entity7 government unit that had been guarding the mustard gas stockpile is still doing so , an indication that @entity171 security forces were still present			1
but the official said monitoring of the facility has determined " they have neither abandoned their posts , nor tried to gain access to the materials			0
" the materials " are secure , guarded and not disturbed , " said the official			0
at hospitals across @entity192 , overwhelmed doctors and nurses attempt to care for the wounded			1
@entity309 , a spokesman for the @entity310 , said two surgical teams were en route from @entity313 with the first scheduled to arrive friday			0
in @entity171 's hometown of @entity315 , the @entity12 said it was negotiating with the longtime ruler 's tribal leaders for their surrender without bloodshed			1
@entity233 said the process of moving government ministries from the opposition base in @entity323 to the capital has inched forward , with about four or five ministerial level officials of the @entity12 already in @entity192			1
in the oil - rich city of @entity329 , several crude oil storage tanks continued burning more than six days after they were set ablaze by retreating @entity171 troops , said @entity331 , the refinery fire chief			1
@entity1 's @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity338 , @entity339 , @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 , @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 and @entity348 contributed to this report .			0
