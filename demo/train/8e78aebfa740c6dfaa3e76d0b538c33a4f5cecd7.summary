-- @entity8 winning film " @entity6 " has brought the plight of @entity3 's slum dwellers to the rest of the world			0
but up to a million slum dwellers in the economic capital @entity11 are set for upheaval as the city is poised for a radical makeover @entity15 , where parts of " @entity6 " were filmed , is one of the largest slums in the world			1
five years after the regional government announced its intention to redevelop @entity15 , the vast @entity11 slum where parts of " @entity6 " were filmed , developers are finally submitting their blueprints for the project			1
nineteen consortiums from around the world are vying to redevelop the 500 - plus acres of land occupied by @entity15 and the bulldozers could move in within six months			1
the scheme is the brainchild of @entity33 , an @entity3 architect who made his name in the @entity35 his vision is to use private money to redevelop the slum and turn @entity11 into an international business destination			1
" if effectively designed and well planned @entity15 could be not very different from @entity41 's @entity40			1
if we plan creatively and bring in the best architects in the world we could create a new language of architecture and buildings for @entity11 , " he told @entity0			1
what 's novel about @entity33 's plan is that rather than seeing a need to entice developers into slum regeneration , he views the land as a resource that developers will pay handsomely to get their hands on			0
the plan is for developers to demolish the slum and build apartments on the site , which will be given free of charge to 57,000 families currently living in @entity15			1
the incentive ? for every 100 sq ft of apartment space the developers give away , they will get to build 133 sq ft of commercial space , which they can sell at market rates			0
back in 1997 , it was @entity33 who realized that @entity15 's location made it an asset			1
in the heart of @entity11 , @entity15 is connected by all three of the city 's railway lines			1
the two highways that link @entity11 to the rest of @entity3 both start nearby and just half a kilometer away is the @entity81 , @entity11 's emerging financial hub , where land prices are astronomical			1
@entity33 estimates that the government could end up making $ 2 to $ 3 billion , the developers stand to make huge profits and @entity15 's residents will get real homes with running water			1
so why has the scheme taken 12 years to get off the ground ? part of the problem is the word ' slum			0
' @entity15 is terribly overcrowded , with a chronic lack of clean water and a dearth of toilets			1
@entity100 runs freely and the stench of feces is ever present			0
but there is a real sense of community , the streets are buzzing with activity and thriving cottage industries , such as pottery and recycling workshops , operate from the ground floor of people 's homes			0
" the @entity15 redevelopment should not be thought of as just a housing project			1
almost every house is involved with some kind of economic activity , " says @entity116 , an advisor to the society for the promotion of @entity119 , which has been campaigning for years to ensure @entity15 's residents do n't lose out in the redevelopment			1
@entity116 says it is essential that residents can continue to work from their homes in the new @entity15 , or they wo n't be able to afford the maintenance costs of their new apartments			2
" if this is not considered , people will sell and the area will become gentrified			0
even though new housing stock will be added to the city , the people for whom it is meant will not be able to benefit , " he told @entity0			0
in june 2007 , some 15,000 @entity15 residents marched against the proposals , which they felt benefited developers at their expense			2
@entity33 says planners have been listening to people 's concerns			0
the new apartment buildings will incorporate communal spaces where residents can carry on their trades and thousands of businesses currently operating illegally in @entity15 will be legalized			2
following objections from residents , the floor space allocated to each family has been increased from 225 sq ft to 300 sq ft. but not everyone in @entity15 stands to benefit			2
many residents lease the upper floor of their homes and their tenants are not eligible for the free apartments			0
neither is anyone who moved to @entity15 after 1999 , nor the laborers who sleep in @entity15 's workshops			2
there is only one place for these people to go -- other slums			0
@entity116 concedes that no one knows how many people will be forced out , but it could be tens of thousands			0
although some are still fighting the plan , @entity33 considers it a fait accompli			0
he predicts that work will begin after the summer monsoon and will take five to seven years to complete			0
with over a billion people living in slums globally , @entity33 sees this involvement of private money as essential for slum regeneration around the world			2
" every major university and design and planning institute in the world is studying this model , " he says			2
" developing countries in @entity186 and @entity187 have invited me to have similar projects in their country			0

@entity15 , in the heart of @entity11 , is one of the biggest slums in the world
the *massive* redevelopment of @entity15 could begin within six months
57,000 families will be *rehoused* on site , but many others will have to move on
scheme is " a model that can be used to *rehabilitate* slums around the world "
