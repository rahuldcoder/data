@entity0 -- it is a year since an 18th - century @entity4 vase was sold in @entity0 for $ 68 million , smashing world records			1
now dealers and auction houses in @entity0 are feverishly anticipating a slew of sales as part of @entity11 in @entity0 , a week - long event that has been attracting newly - wealthy @entity4 buyers and collectors to the capital for over a decade			1
@entity15 , chairman of @entity11 in @entity0 , says the week of @entity17 art sales and exhibitions in @entity0 has been running for 13 years , and has seen a " chinese art boom , " with collectors from mainland @entity4 and @entity21 flocking to @entity0 to check out the array of antique wares laid out in the salesrooms and galleries			1
antique vases hailing from the much - sought - after 18th - century @entity28 period are going under the hammer at major auction houses @entity31 's , @entity32 and @entity33 and on display at the commercial galleries , alongside decorative objets d'art and furnishings			1
@entity33 is selling a rare vase estimated to fetch between $ 8 million ( £ 5 million ) and $ 13 million ( £ 8 million )			1
the 50cm tall vase features delicate chrysanthemum blossoms in white and pink tones and bears the @entity28 seal			0
" the @entity28 period is really the apex of the technical achievement for @entity4 porcelain , it was a time of great prosperity that led to great opulence and magnificent objects were produced for the imperial court , " explained @entity43 , a senior specialist in the @entity4 department at @entity33			1
@entity31 's , too , is hosting a round of sales , with lots ranging from ornately decorated vases to a gilt - bronze enamel tiger , estimated to fetch between $ 319,000 ( £ 200,000 ) and $ 479,000 ( £ 300,000 )			2
all houses are anticipating that the buyers of these artifacts will be @entity4 , either from @entity21 or the mainland , with some @entity65 customers as well			1
it 's a trend that has become more and more pronounced in the last decade , driving prices ever higher			0
" it 's a true tide - change , " said @entity17 art dealer @entity68 , whose @entity0 dealership has been running for 50 years			1
" the @entity4 were n't allowed to buy anything under @entity73 and they are developing very quickly , tending to go into an area and exhausting it completely before moving onto another one , " he continued			2
westerners , who at one point collected this type of work , are being increasingly priced out of the market and are now more likely to sell than buy , said @entity68			0
" it 's very patriotic , i 'd put it down to that , " opined @entity31 's specialist @entity83 , as to why @entity4 buyers are so keen to pay such large sums for antiques from their homeland			2
" they want to bring back their heritage , which gives them brownie points at home and if they buy it for a lot of money , there 's a status thing there too , " added @entity68			0
the major auction houses are a regular draw to the new class of @entity4 rich but so are smaller ones , such as @entity106 , the comparatively small auction house in @entity0 that sold the $ 68 million vase in 2010			1
" the market is very strong and people will go to where the object is , " said @entity83			0
" you go to the most remote little auction house that 's difficult to get to and with @entity115 , half of mainland @entity4 is already there , " @entity68 said			2
and with the new class of @entity4 buyers entering the market right now , high prices have become normalized			2
" if you start from day one at this level , then you think it 's normal , " he said			0
" it 's incredible , i think it will have its ups and downs but the long - term trend is that ( prices will keep ) going up , " he continued			0
so why do @entity4 buyers come to @entity0 to buy art ? " where @entity0 's always been very lucky is in the phenomenal levels of expertise here , " said @entity128 in @entity0			1
" you have world - class dealers , which is ironic because there are n't that many collectors here , " he continued			0
" it 's that classic @entity137 thing of being a middleman -- the art comes in from abroad to be sold here to go abroad again			0
it 's what we 're good at , " he said .			0
