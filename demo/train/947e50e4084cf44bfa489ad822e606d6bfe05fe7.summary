-- it 's been more than 20 years since he fought in a sandpit , but @entity4 still recalls the dusty village lots of his youth , unmarked except for footprints stained by sweat and blood			1
stamping about in a ritual known as " lat kha maung , " he slaps his open palms against his elbows , imitating the wings of a fighting cock , as if attempting to summon its spirit			0
@entity18 is performed before the matches as a kind of ritual that originated in farming villages			0
this is the way of @entity24 -- @entity26 's traditional form of boxing			1
hidden from the rest of the world for decades , the sport , like @entity26 itself , is experiencing a revival and rediscovery both at home and abroad			1
in august , the @entity35 in @entity36 hosted an international bare - knuckled @entity24 challenger fight			1
similar events in @entity39 have helped usher in a new era for @entity24			1
fighters turned trainers once derided as a sport fit for only rugged brutes -- @entity4 required eight stitches in his face after a fight at age 17 -- @entity24 is finding new respect at the @entity51 in @entity52			1
here , @entity4 teaches introductory lessons to a stratum of society distinctly different from the fierce yet humble fighters he grew up facing in the @entity58 region			1
his students are local doctors , foreign investment bankers and even @entity26 celebrities , including advertisement pinup @entity61			1
" two years ago , foreigners began coming here , " says @entity63 , founder and director of the gym			0
" today the @entity24 classes are , on average , half foreign and half local			1
" weekend classes can attract up to 10 students , he says			0
the boxing club is especially proud of having trained a headline - making @entity24 fighter from the @entity74 , " mr. @entity75 " @entity73			1
during a fight in 2013 , @entity73 , 44 , displayed a " mental and physical toughness , " according to mr. win , that won over the crowd and landed him a draw in the ring			0
but those interested in taking up the sport do n't have to have professional aspirations			0
" the workout for extreme pro fighters may not be appropriate for starters so we use a more simplified form for our students , " says mr. win , who by day is the @entity87 , an @entity88 ngo			1
mr. @entity63 ( as he prefers to be called ) is @entity95 to @entity4 's @entity96			2
he coached the @entity98 freeweight champion until the fighter 's retirement			2
one of mr. @entity63 's fondest memories of coaching was @entity4 's first fight in @entity104 , 10 years ago			2
competing under @entity24 rules , a local jujitsu star went up against the then - 29 - year - old @entity4			1
@entity4 took him down in less than a minute , leaving the @entity108 crowd astonished			0
" they watched a country boy ko his opponent in the first round , unexpectedly , " mr. @entity63 recalls with pride			0
fewer kicks , higher intensity at @entity116 , @entity4 and mr. @entity63 now work as tag - team instructors , offering training sessions for 5,000 kyat ( $ 5 ) per person			0
the setting is typical of the improvised simplicity familiar across @entity26			1
an iron - wrought roof and plastic tarps are all that shield the gym from the elements			0
novices practice agility by bouncing on tires			0
the modest ring vibrates with energy every saturday , when practitioners spar			0
though it bears some resemblance to the @entity134 practiced in neighboring @entity135 , @entity24 is different in a number of ways			2
" in @entity134 , kicks and knee strikes prevail , but @entity24 fighters use more punches and fewer kicks , " explains mr. @entity63			1
" traditionally , @entity24 fighters do n't fight with gloves , and we use a lot of other components such as throwing , choking and head butts			1
at a more elemental level , the momentum and fighting intensity are much faster			0
" bare - knuckled fighting watching matches , that momentum becomes evident			2
" there are no five or six rounds in @entity160 , " says @entity155 , a 30 - year - old private equity professional from @entity157 , now living in @entity52			0
" fundamentally , it 's a bare - knuckled sport			2
" if you get close and elbow [ your opponent ] once , then you got him			0
it 's really about that one blow			2
" in its traditional form , @entity24 is " fought with bare knuckles bound by cloth , " says mr. @entity63			1
boxing gloves are a recent development			2
as part of its current revival and reform period , contemporary mixed martial arts matches incorporating @entity24 fighters tend to enforce the use of gloves			1
" @entity160 fighters never put on gloves until now , " says mr. @entity63			0
still , the old sandpit spirit perseveres			0
having previously trained under @entity134 rules , @entity155 has over the past year become one of the most dedicated foreign attendees at @entity116			0
above all , he says he 's learned that in @entity160 , self - defense is crucial			0
" before taking up @entity24 , i did n't realize i was so unprotected , " says @entity155			2
" if you wear a 14 - ounce [ boxing ] glove , your chin is protected , but when you are in a @entity24 fight it 's much easier [ for your opponent ] to make contact , so you must be more on guard			1
" it 's a lesson an increasingly diverse array of students is learning in @entity52 and across @entity199			0
