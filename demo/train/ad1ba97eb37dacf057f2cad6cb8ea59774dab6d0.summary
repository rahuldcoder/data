-- @entity2 authorities are considering criminal charges -- albeit not for a hate crime -- against whomever wrote a stark letter to an @entity8 family urging them to either " move or euthanize " their autistic son			1
prosecutors determined that " despite the hateful language used , " the content of the letter " falls below the threshold for a hate crime , " the @entity13 issued a statement tuesday			1
" however , there are other criminal code issues that are being considered , " police added			2
the anonymous letter stirred a far - reaching outcry , as well as prompting neighbors to rally around the targeted 13 - year - old , @entity27 , since it became public			2
the letter -- signed " one pissed off mother " -- castigates @entity27 's family for what they describe as the " nuisance " the teen poses			1
" that noise he makes when he is outside is dreadful ! its ( sic ) scares the hell out of my normal children ! ! ! ! ! " the letter states			0
" they should take whatever non retarded body parts he possesses and donate it to science			0
" the writer tells the family to " go live in a trailer in the woods with your wild animal kid " and to do " the right thing and move or euthanize him ! " " either way we are all better off			1
" the message was delivered to @entity27 's grandmother 's house , about 15 minutes from the @entity27 home in @entity62 , a town 40 miles from @entity63			2
the boy 's father , @entity64 , explained that he works and has multiple sclerosis , so @entity27 goes to his grandmother 's three to four times a week			0
" if someone is sick enough to not only have those thoughts , but to write those thoughts out and then to mail them " @entity73 said , then " they should be considered dangerous			0
" the letter writer has not been identified by authorities , and police have asked people to give them any information on the case			1
as to @entity27 , who is going into the eighth grade this year , his dad said he is not aware exactly of what has happened			0
" but he sure is getting a kick out of all of the attention			0

a letter sent to an @entity8 woman 's house calls her grandson a " nuisance "
it urges his family to do " the right thing and move or euthanize him ! "
police say they are considering criminal charges against the letter writer
but " despite the hateful language , " they say , the words do *n't* *qualify* as a hate crime
