-- one of the men controversially pardoned earlier this year by @entity3 's outgoing governor could land back behind bars after being charged with driving drunk and causing an accident that killed an 18 - year - old woman			1
a @entity8 , @entity3 , grand jury has charged @entity10 with drunken driving leading to a death , felony drunken driving and fleeing the scene of an accident where a death occurred , according to the indictment filed on thursday and obtained monday by @entity0			1
the accident happened in october			0
if convicted , @entity10 could be sentenced to at least 30 years in prison			2
his attorney did not respond immediately to a call on monday for comment			0
after the charges were handed up , @entity10 turned himself in and a judge set bail at $ 50,000 , @entity26 from the @entity8 prosecuting attorney 's office said			1
the 56 - year - old posted bond on friday and was released , according to official online records			0
this is n't @entity10 's first - run in with the law in @entity3			2
he was convicted of felony drunken driving in march 2009 , soon after having been convicted in july 2008 and november 2008 for drunken driving			1
the former @entity36 investigator was one of nearly 200 convicted criminals , including four murderers , whom gov. @entity39 pardoned shortly before leaving office earlier this year			1
the pardons elicited an uproar , with attorney general @entity43 leading a charge to overturn them			0
but after legal challenges , they were upheld			0
@entity10 was still going through a court - mandated drug rehab program when he applied for his pardon last summer			2
on september 30 , the @entity51 sent its review of @entity10 's application to @entity39 , recommending a full pardon in a 3 - 2 vote			1
a week later , on october 7 , @entity10 was driving under the influence again , according to the @entity57			1
@entity59 attempted to pull out onto a highway just outside @entity61 when @entity10 's truck slammed into the side of her car , the patrol says			2
@entity59 was killed , and her older sister suffered serious injuries			0
@entity10 was jailed for violating his probation from his previous @entity69 cases			2
in the grand jury indictment , @entity10 is accused of " willfully , unlawfully and feloniously " driving while intoxicated ; refusing to immediately stop or give his name , address or registration ; and having " negligently " caused @entity59 's death			1
when he received the pardon in january , the convicted @entity69 felon still sat in an @entity78 , @entity3 , jail cell , awaiting formal charges for the arrest tied to that case			0
@entity39 had said that he was n't aware of @entity10 's october 2011 @entity69 arrest when he chose to pardon him			1
but e-mails obtained by @entity0 show that the governor 's office did , in fact , know about it			2
@entity88 , the governor 's chief counsel , and secretary of state @entity91 were told about the october car crash that killed @entity59 just days after it happened			1
@entity94 and @entity91 were even urged by a lawyer in the firm that represented @entity10 not to issue the pardon , according to the e-mails			1
" they knew it , and they did n't stop it , " @entity59 's mother @entity98 told @entity0 last month , after becoming overcome with emotion when she saw the e-mails			1
" why did n't they do something ? " it is not known whether anyone communicated this information to @entity39			0
his spokeswoman would not comment on the e-mails , citing an ongoing case on executive pardon power that is before the state @entity111			0
the full pardon granted by the governor , for the march 2009 conviction , gave @entity10 back the rights that were taken away as a felon , such as voting			1
but his two other @entity69 convictions remain on his record , according to the state attorney 's office in @entity122			0
that means that @entity10 will avoid the possibility of a stiffer sentence if he 's convicted on the charges tied to @entity59 's death , because it will be treated as his third dui offense instead of his fourth			2
however , he could be back to where he was before the pardon : as a convicted felon , thus losing the rights that were restored to him			0
asked monday night about the new charges , @entity98 said she does n't want @entity10 to get any more second chances			0
" i hope no one gives him any more pardons , " charity 's mother said			1
" i pray for justice			0
" @entity0 's @entity142 and @entity143 contributed to this report .			0
