@entity0 slowly climbed out of his parents ' car			1
@entity4 and @entity5 had driven their son to work because he was n't feeling well -- for the past couple of days , simple tasks had left him short of breath and exhausted			1
at 577 pounds , being out of shape was normal for @entity0 , so he ignored it			1
but as he headed toward the door of his office on june 20 , 2010 , the ground suddenly shifted			1
the @entity14 were pulling away when @entity5 's cell phone rang			2
all she heard on the other end was gasping			2
the couple stopped the car and sprinted back to the building , where they found their son lying in the bushes , struggling to breathe			1
the ride to the hospital took only five minutes , but to @entity5 , it seemed like hours			1
@entity0 did n't care how long it took -- he knew he was going to die			1
" i was absolutely convinced that i was having a heart attack			0
i had been told by doctors before that at my size , if i ever had heart problems , they were n't going to be able to operate on me			2
so there was a very good chance that this was the end -- that i would get there and there would n't be anything they could do , " he said			2
out of control for years , @entity0 worked the night shift at a @entity41 call center in @entity42 , @entity43 , 20 miles from his home in @entity45			1
he skipped breakfast , ate fast food for lunch and dinner , then picked up a pizza or some convenience store snacks on his way home			0
he often drank more than a gallon of soda a day			0
by the age of 37 , he had a body mass index around 87			0
a bmi over 30 is considered obese			0
" he was very aware that he had a problem , " @entity5 said			0
" it was out of control			0
" june 20 was possibly the best thing that could have happened to @entity0 , although it certainly did n't seem like it at the time			1
his " heart attack " was actually a pulmonary embolism , or a blood clot that had traveled to his lungs , blocking his oxygen flow			0
according to the @entity74 , " sudden death is the first symptom " in about a quarter of patients who have a pulmonary embolism			0
for six days , @entity0 lay in a hospital bed , covered in bruises caused by the blood thinners being pumped into his body			1
the blood thinners slowly cleared the blockage in his lungs , giving him plenty of time to think			0
" at first , i felt like a victim , like somebody or something had done this to me , " @entity0 said in a @entity83 video about his experience			1
" but then reality set in and the pain turned to anger			0
" several doctors tried to broach the subject of weight - loss surgery while he was in the hospital , but @entity0 refused			1
both he and his mother had friends who had gone through the surgery and were suffering from complications			2
if i can make it out of here alive , he thought , i 'm not coming back			0
small steps today , @entity0 , 39 , tells his story from the driver 's seat of a car that he would n't have fit in two years ago			1
he shops for clothes at department stores , buys one seat on an airplane instead of two and sleeps through the night			0
" the absolute best thing about all the weight that i 've lost is just waking up every day and realizing that i do n't weigh 577 pounds anymore , " he said with a laugh			1
" the biggest rewards are the smallest ones			0
" small steps are what began @entity0 's weight loss journey			1
after leaving the hospital , he began to move -- at first pushing a shopping cart around the grocery store like a toddler learning to walk			2
then he ventured to the mailbox at the end of his driveway			0
soon , he was conquering several miles at a time			0
he lost 130 pounds in the first six months , then dropped another 140 pounds over the course of the next year			1
at 5 - foot - 8 , @entity0 now weighs just under 300 pounds			1
" it turns out it really is true , " @entity0 wrote in his @entity131 submission			1
" if you use more energy than you take in , you will lose weight			2
" @entity0 switched to a day shift at work to conquer his bad eating habits			1
he 's very particular about what he puts in his mouth , refusing to stray from self - prepared lean meats , vegetables and fruits			0
he eats five to six meals a day , every two to three hours			0
he measures his portions so that his total calorie count for the day hits 2,500			0
" food is everywhere , " he said , reflecting on his struggles to keep on track at work or in social settings			0
" i just ca n't eat it anymore			2
i ca n't do it ever again			2
i do n't have the ability to have just a little bit			2
they think i must be miserable because i ... do n't allow myself to have certain things			2
[ but ] the benefits i have gained , the prize is worth the struggle			0
" after dropping his first 70 pounds , @entity0 decided to hire a personal trainer			1
this was n't the first time he had tried to lose weight by exercising , and in the past he had burned himself out pushing too hard , too fast			1
his trainer , @entity165 , started slowly			0
at first , all they did was sit down and stand up			0
for the 500 - pound @entity0 , that was enough			1
last year , @entity0 limped across the finish line of the @entity169 he entered			1
this year , he plans to run the whole race			2
he 's still losing six to seven pounds a month and hopes to eventually get down to 200 pounds			2
simple prayers every morning , @entity5 wakes up and asks @entity172 to give @entity0 one more day			1
she understands the obstacles placed before her son -- most addicts can give up their abusive substance , but he ca n't just give up food			2
" i guess there 's always that little shadow of a doubt , " @entity5 said			0
" but i know also that he 's a very strong person ... if it can be done , he can do it			0
" when @entity0 returned to the doctor , the change in his blood work was almost unbelievable			1
he 's off many of the medications he was on before ; his blood pressure medication has been cut four times over the last two years			0
his ldl cholesterol , the bad kind , is 100 -- an optimal number			0
most importantly , at 577 pounds , @entity0 was prediabetic			1
now , he 's looking forward to a bright , diabetes - free future			0
" i think what gets lost in the advertisements and everything that 's written about weight loss is that if people would keep it simple , that everyone has that power in them			1
you can change your life			0
