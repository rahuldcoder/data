@entity0 -- we all fantasize of one day quitting our jobs in a storm of profanities , middle fingers and toppled computers			2
rarely does it happen , though , so when flight attendant @entity9 lived the dream on @entity9 at @entity12 on monday -- yelling " it 's been great ! , " grabbing a beer and jumping out the emergency slide into airline history -- i sort of had to sit back and applaud			1
it resonated in the industry , too			0
" it was shocking , " said @entity19 , a flight attendant of 18 years who blogs at @entity20 and calls the high - strung northeast the trickiest region for smooth passenger - attendant relations			1
" he basically lived out a fantasy i did n't know i had			0
" tension between airline companies , airline staff and air passengers seems to dip to new lows every year			1
passengers whine about an increase of fees on such things as checked baggage , meals and use of blankets ( the industry makes nearly $ 8 billion a year in such fees , says the @entity42 @entity41 )			1
they also have to surrender harmless toothpaste and disclose sock styles at airport security checks			0
and flight attendants ? they endure long hours ( on average about 80 flying hours monthly , @entity19 says ) and low pay ( starting at $ 14 per hour and topping at about $ 40 )			1
some can join unions , but at @entity52 , @entity51 was n't in a union			0
all too often , they deal with self - righteous passengers who treat them as assistants , or -- in the case of @entity51 -- allegedly become abusive			1
but considering that there are about 50,000 commercial flights daily , our record of getting along peacefully is pretty good			0
that more flight attendants do n't flip out at obnoxious passenger behavior is what 's really surprising here			1
( the worst such behavior i 've seen is a drunk trio refusing to stop singing on a flight from @entity70 , @entity71 , to @entity72 , @entity73 ; i nearly made it a quartet			1
) perhaps more scenarios ought to end like this recent pillow fight on @entity77 ? still , maybe @entity51 had a point , if a tad overstated			0
perhaps it 's time to go over some ground rules			1
here are some tips to keep your flight attendant from going @entity51 on you			1
the folks in the terminal taking your ticket -- or repelling your delusional pleas for free upgrades -- are frequently those serving you on the flight			1
so be nice right away			0
" hey , good ticket skills " is one charmer			0
before crouching to enter the bathroom , good - naturedly ask " will i get a hernia in there ? " if they get it , they 'll love you ; if not , they 're sort of lame			1
flight attendants do n't need to be reminded their airline is struggling -- and face it , nearly all of them are -- so do n't throw out the ol ' " no wonder your airline is on the ropes " if they 're out of cranberry juice			1
certainly wo n't get you a bonus cookie			0
take one for the team			0
when you get the teacher - scolds - child reminders to put your @entity121 away , or tuck that fanny pack deeper under the seat in front of you , just do it with a smile or self - deprecating remark like " gosh , i 'm bad at geometry			2
" @entity19 said attendants actually hate having to remind passengers about this			1
" i dread that part of the job			2
unless you 've lived under a rock , you know about that already			0
" how far have you flown today ? " or " what 's the dumbest passenger question you 've heard ? " can show you 're interested in them as actual people			2
do n't dump trash in the seat pouch			0
treat the airline like a friend 's home -- do n't trash it			1
the pouch in front of you is not a place to put dirty diapers or your sandwich wrappers			0
" i put my hand in puke one time , " @entity19 said			0
" not fun at all			0
some folks , ok mostly guys , treat the aisle as a walkway of delights and visually grope attendants as they saunter down it			2
if an attendant says " snooze the toilet break , " snooze it			2
if you 're not yet at the gate , do n't get up to sneak a first grab at the overhead storage			0
the bag will be there			0
you deserve no bonus privileges above your fellow passengers			2
to the passenger who reportedly ignited @entity51 's meltdown ? after cursing and supposedly pulling a bag out that slammed into @entity51 , like in that @entity178 scene in " @entity179 ? " maybe you ought to laminate this list			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			1
