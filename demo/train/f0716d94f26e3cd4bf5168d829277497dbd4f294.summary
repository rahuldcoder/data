@entity0 -- president @entity2 is expected to make a statement thursday on the partisan standoff over how best to extend the expiring payroll tax cut , according to the @entity6			1
@entity2 will be joined by " @entity7 who would see their taxes go up if the @entity6 @entity9 fail to act , " the @entity6 said			1
some of those people have participated in @entity2 's social media campaign highlighting what a $ 40 loss to a paycheck can mean to the average @entity7			2
wednesday , the president called @entity6 speaker @entity16 and @entity18 majority leader @entity17 to discuss the impasse , the @entity6 said			1
a two - month extension passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support by the @entity30 - controlled @entity18 " is the only option to ensure that middle class families are n't hit with a tax hike in 10 days and gives both sides the time needed to work out a full year solution , " @entity6 press secretary @entity20 told reporters			1
earlier in the day , @entity16 , @entity32 , and @entity6 @entity9 negotiators urged @entity30 to restart talks on the matter , with the goal of an immediate one - year extension			1
we 're ready to work , " @entity16 told reporters on @entity38			0
" we can resolve these differences ... and give the @entity7 people a real @entity41 present			0
" during their phone call , @entity16 told @entity2 that @entity6 @entity9 were " elected to change the way @entity0 does business and that we should not waste the next ten days simply because it is an inconvenient time of year , " an aide to the speaker said			1
at stake : a tax cut for 160 million @entity7 , as well as extended emergency federal unemployment benefits and the so - called " doc fix , " a delay in significant scheduled pay cuts to @entity53 physicians			0
all three measures are currently scheduled to expire december 31			0
despite mounting pressure on @entity60 to give in and pass a short - term extension , a well - placed @entity6 @entity9 source indicated his side would not consider an end - game to the standoff until next week , just days before the deadline for taxes to go up			1
@entity6 : @entity67 inaction a threat to the economy a growing number of political observers believe @entity30 hold the political high ground in the struggle , and that @entity9 are in the midst of squandering their long - held advantage on the tax issue			2
on saturday , the @entity18 voted 89 - 10 to approve two additional months for all three programs			2
the idea , leaders have repeatedly said , is to buy more time to hammer out a longer - term deal			0
the conservative @entity6 @entity9 caucus , however , revolted against that blueprint , calling it an inadequate patchwork plan that will create more economic instability and do little to create jobs			1
on tuesday , the @entity6 voted 229 - 193 on a virtual party - line basis to express its disagreement with the @entity18 plan and call for the creation of a @entity6 - @entity18 conference committee to resolve the matter -- something already ruled out by @entity17 , @entity93			1
the $ 33 billion " bipartisan compromise that was reached on saturday is the only viable way to prevent a tax hike on january 1 , " @entity2 said after the @entity6 vote			1
" it 's the only one			0
" the @entity6 also approved a separate resolution supporting a year - long extension of both the payroll tax cut and emergency unemployment benefits , along with a new , two - year doc fix			2
there is no indication , however , that congressional negotiators would be able to reach a bipartisan agreement by the end of the year			0
further complicating matters is the fact that the @entity18 has adjourned for the year			0
most @entity6 members also left @entity0 after tuesday 's vote			2
dispute creates @entity9 split between @entity6 and @entity18 @entity16 released a public letter to @entity2 tuesday urging him to order the @entity18 back from its holiday break to take part in further talks -- a gesture immediately rejected by the @entity6			1
in a symbolic move , @entity120 rep. @entity119 , a member of the @entity30 leadership , walked onto the floor of a virtually empty @entity6 chamber wednesday morning to call for the @entity6 to hold a direct , up - or - down vote on the bipartisan @entity18 plan			1
@entity16 prevented a direct vote on the @entity18 bill tuesday , signaling that @entity6 @entity9 leaders may lack enough @entity9 support to defeat it in the face of unrelenting pressure from the @entity6 , congressional @entity30 and some @entity18 republicans			1
the @entity134 -- always a critical sounding board for conservatives -- blasted @entity16 and his @entity6 @entity9 colleagues in an editorial wednesday , arguing that they had " achieved the small miracle of letting mr. @entity2 position himself as an election - year tax cutter			1
" " at this stage , @entity9 would do best to cut their losses and find a way to extend the payroll holiday quickly , " the paper 's editorial writers said			0
" then go home and return in january with a united @entity6 - @entity18 strategy that forces @entity30 to make specific policy choices that highlight the differences between the parties on spending , taxes and regulation			2
... the alternative is more chaotic retreat and the return of all - @entity30 rule			0
" asked to respond to the editorial , @entity16 insisted that the @entity9 remains " the party of lower taxes for the @entity7 people			2
" @entity16 's response did not appear to stem a rising tide of criticism from his @entity18 counterparts			2
" @entity167 have painted themselves into a corner			0
they are on their own , " a @entity18 @entity9 leadership aide told @entity1 wednesday			1
" this is a lose - lose situation for us			0
( @entity6 @entity9 ) let the @entity30 get the messaging advantage and , more specifically , we 've turned one of our key issues on its head			1
the republicans look like they are the ones blocking tax relief			0
" " when you are arguing process , you are losing , by definition , " the aide said			0
" we are arguing process while they 've got politics on their side			0
" a number of @entity9 have said the party should have declared victory after winning an agreement by @entity2 -- as part of the payroll tax cut package -- to make a decision within the next 60 days on whether to proceed with the proposed @entity196 oil pipeline from @entity197 to the @entity198			2
republicans and some @entity30 union leaders say the controversial pipeline will create thousands of new jobs ; critics question its environmental impact			0
according to @entity6 @entity9 sources , their strategy is now to generate as much news coverage as possible of their eight appointed conferees in coming days to keep the pressure on @entity30 to negotiate			1
" we are going to try to remind people that we are still in town ready to work , " one @entity6 @entity9 leadership aide said			1
a failure to act could have major economic and political fallout			0
the payroll tax break alone is worth roughly $ 1,000 a year for an average family			0
numerous observers believe @entity2 is preparing to parrot @entity221 's 1948 campaign next year by running against an unpopular , dysfunctional @entity67 controlled partly by the @entity9			2
@entity1 's @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , and @entity228 contributed to this report			0

@entity18 @entity9 aide says @entity6 @entity9 have " painted themselves into a corner "
