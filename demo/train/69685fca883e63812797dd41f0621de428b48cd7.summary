it 's the biggest man - made epidemic in the @entity2			1
that 's how a doctor in @entity5 described it to me as we sat outside the state @entity9 in @entity11			1
he was talking about accidental death from prescription drug overdoses			1
the doctor , @entity14 , medical director for @entity5 's @entity15 , recounted terrifying case after case and told me it was the saddest thing he had ever seen			2
i remember him telling me about a teenager dying because he had taken too much narcotic medication after a dental procedure			0
the most common scenario , he said , involves a man in his 40s or 50s who visits a doctor with a backache and walks out with a pain pill prescription			1
about three years later , typically , the man dies in his sleep from taking too many pills , or mixing them with alcohol			1
they do n't intend to die , but more than 20,000 times a year -- every 19 minutes , on average -- that is exactly what happens			1
accidental overdoses are now a leading cause of accidental deaths in the @entity2 , surpassing car crashes			1
as a neurosurgeon working in a busy level 1 trauma hospital , i had an idea that the problem was growing -- but the numbers still boggle the mind			0
distribution of morphine , the main ingredient in popular painkillers , increased 600 % from 1997 - 2007 , according to the @entity53			2
in the @entity2 , we now prescribe enough pain pills to give every man , woman and child one every four hours , around the clock , for three weeks			1
@entity60 : the truth about prescription medication addiction we often pay close attention if a celebrity dies of an overdose , but truth is , it 's our friends , neighbors and yes , our own family members who are dying			1
in fact , the person who really brought the issue to my attention was former president @entity75			2
he called me a few months ago , and i could immediately tell he was broken up about something			0
i had worked for him in the @entity77 in the late ' 90s , talked to him countless times since then , and i had never heard him like this			0
two of his friends had both lost sons , he told me			0
the cause : accidental overdose			1
i will never forget how he put it			0
" look , no one thinks having a few beers and an @entity89 is a good idea , but you also do n't expect to die			0
" i knew at that moment we needed to do our part in the media to shine a bright light on this issue and find solutions that work			0
as a starting point , 80 % of the world 's pain pills are consumed right here in the @entity2 , according to 2011 congressional testimony from the @entity103 of @entity104			1
no doubt , many are for perfectly legitimate reasons and are not misused or abused			0
yet culturally , we have become increasingly intolerant of even minor amounts of pain and increasingly comfortable with taking heavy - duty medications			2
we know , however , that after just a few months of taking the pills , something starts to change in the body			2
the effectiveness wears off , and patients typically report getting only about 30 % pain relief , compared with when they started			1
even more concerning , a subgroup of these patients develop a condition known as hyperalgesia , an increased sensitivity to pain			2
@entity60 : more is not always better in medicine as you might guess , all of this creates a situation where the person starts to take more and more pills			1
and even though they are no longer providing much pain relief , they can still diminish the body 's drive to breathe			1
if you are awake you may not notice it , but if you fall asleep with too many of these pills in your system , you never wake up			2
add alcohol , and the problem is exponentially worse			2
people who take pain or sleeping pills and drink a couple glasses of wine are playing @entity143 roulette			1
i am not at all sorry for coming off dramatic or scary as i write this			0
i only wish i had been this dramatic years ago			0
truth is , it is easier for a doctor to write a prescription than to explore other effective options to combat pain			1
and it is easier for patients to take those prescription pills than to search for alternatives themselves			1
both those things must absolutely change			0
in my upcoming documentary , i will explain how we arrived in this deadly situation , but more importantly , explore solutions to address it			2
i crisscrossed the country finding what worked and what did n't			0
i spoke to doctors , patients and families who lost a loved one -- even one man i met who shares my last name			0
as i said , it hits close to home			0
@entity75 has dedicated a significant part of his post-presidency domestic efforts to this cause , and it will not come as a surprise that he has identified areas where we can all make a difference			0
you will hear his thoughts on this issue for the first time in the documentary			0
throughout my career , i have traveled the world and seen problems so intransigent that i thought solutions would never come			0
with accidental deaths due to prescription drugs , however , we have an opportunity to fix the problem and end this large man - made epidemic			1
