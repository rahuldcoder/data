-- it 's a good thing that @entity2 is only the president of the @entity3 and leader of the free world , and that he does n't have a really important job like television sportscaster			1
because in that other role , as we learned a few months ago , a man is simply not allowed to publicly compliment a woman on her good looks without getting in big trouble			1
in january , after the @entity17 , the @entity16 commentator came under fire in the media and blogosphere			0
at issue : off - handed comments that @entity14 made about @entity25 quarterback @entity24 's girlfriend , @entity26			2
@entity16 issued an apology , saying that the 73 - year - old veteran sportscaster " went too far " in his commentary			2
in an interview with the @entity33 , @entity31 journalism professor @entity30 called what @entity14 said " extraordinarily inappropriate			2
" on the sports news website , @entity35 , @entity36 suggested that his remarks were , at the least , " weird and creepy			0
" it went on and on			0
opinion : give @entity14 a break so what did @entity14 say back then that was so terrible ? as the camera focused on @entity49 , a former @entity50 , in the stands , the sportscaster turned to his co-announcer @entity51 , a former quarterback at @entity52 , and said : " you quarterbacks , you get all the good - looking women			2
was this an overreaction ? and did @entity14 get a bum rap ? yes , and yes			0
but not many people said so at the time			0
instead , the dominant narrative was that a public figure had succumbed to voyeurism and was essentially " hitting on " this young woman			2
opinion : @entity2 comment sexist ? i call it a compliment by contrast , @entity2 is n't catching much criticism for a similar comment that he made thursday during a swing through @entity72			1
the wince - inducing remark may have been nothing more than innocent banter between old friends , as @entity2 supporters claimed			1
but it is also undeniably sexist			0
how do we know ? because the comment objectifies a professional woman , and it is not something that you 're likely to hear said about a man with the same credentials			1
it all happened at a fundraising lunch thursday in @entity89 , @entity72 , as @entity2 was rattling off the qualities of @entity72 attorney general @entity91 , who is often mentioned as a likely future gubernatorial candidate			1
those of us who live in @entity72 already know that @entity94 is smart , tough and likable			0
now , thanks to @entity2 , we know something else			2
" she 's brilliant and she 's dedicated , she 's tough , " @entity2 said in describing our state 's chief law enforcement officer			1
" she also happens to be , by far , the best - looking attorney general in the country			1
" @entity2 's ' best - looking ' quip : appropriate in the real world ? the fact that the crowd responded with a mixture of chuckles and groans must have signaled to the president that he had stepped in it			1
" it 's true , " he told the crowd			0
" no , mr. president , you come on			0
this is how you talk about a colleague , a fellow elected official , a fellow lawyer with the goods to compete head to head with any man in the country ? all this talk about how @entity2 is a different type of leader for a new century , one unencumbered by the prejudices and stereotypes that plagued earlier generations and one who symbolizes how far we 've come			1
and this is what we get ? " @entity137 " meets " @entity138			0
" so , when a reporter for the @entity141 asked @entity142 , president of the @entity72 chapter of @entity144 , about the president 's comments , she could n't hide her disgust			1
" i wish ( this call ) was about something substantive , " @entity142 told the journalist			0
" i think that is my reaction , is that that seems to be the only time that the @entity156 gets called is n't when full - scope pregnancy coverage is being cut from the budget or something other that 's going to impact women in a detrimental way right here in this city in the state government			1
but we worry about whether the president thinks @entity91 is pretty			1
i guess my comment is no comment , because we 're too busy trying to protect women and girls			0
on friday , according to @entity173 press secretary @entity172 , @entity2 called @entity94 to apologize -- not for his comments , but for the " distraction " they created			2
the president , @entity172 said , did not want " in any way to diminish the attorney general 's profession , accomplishments and her capabilities			1
" he added that @entity2 " fully recognizes the challenges women continue to face in the workplace and that they should not be judged based on appearance			2
" @entity94 ' communications director , @entity187 , said in a statement that the attorney general and @entity2 " have been friends for many years			1
they had a great conversation yesterday and she strongly supports him			0
" those are nice statements			0
but they do n't end the controversy			0
the issue is n't just what @entity2 said but how folks are reacting to what he said			1
there is only one reason the president is skating on these remarks			0
it 's because the people who normally complain about this stuff -- the folks who make up the grievance lobby -- are among his strongest supporters			0
this is an example of selective outrage and double standards			1
that part of the story is n't pretty			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			2

president @entity2 referred to @entity91 as the best - looking attorney general
@entity218 : the president 's comment is inappropriate
he says the remark objectifies a professional woman , and is unlikely to be said about a man
@entity218 : @entity2 is n't getting much criticism , partly because there is selective outrage
