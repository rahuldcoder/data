here are five interesting things you might not know about the royal tyke			0
@entity22 had a low - key birth , relatively speaking			0
as the @entity6 went into labor , prince @entity4 drove her to the hospital in an unmarked minivan -- with minimal security and without a royal entourage -- from @entity29 to the back entrance of @entity31			1
even more down - to - earth ? the announcement of @entity22 's birth first came through e-mail and @entity35			2
it was truly a digital moment , according to @entity38 's @entity37 , who reported live from the hospital that day			2
the duchess , with prince @entity4 present , delivered the baby boy at 4:24 p.m. he weighed 8 pounds and 6 ounces			1
the couple later announced he would be known as @entity44 prince george of cambridge			0
prince @entity4 's first interview as a dad what 's in a royal name ? 2			1
his early days were not spent at the royal palace			2
despite the tradition that royal newborns spend their first days inside palace walls , @entity44 spent his at the duchess ' family home in the village of @entity58			2
the decision was reportedly met with protest from the highest ranks in the royal family , including @entity63 there was a colossal security presence outside the home , inside it remained just the family			0
@entity6 's mother , @entity68 , took on the all - important role of royal nanny while her father , @entity71 , became the royal photographer			1

@entity22 has a special connection with princess @entity76			1
@entity22 's christening was held on october 23 at the @entity78 at @entity79			0
that location was no coincidence ; it was where the body of prince @entity4 's mother , princess @entity76 , lay at rest in the days leading up to her funeral in 1997			1
the event also set the stage for the epic portrait of @entity91 and her three direct heirs , @entity12 , @entity4 and @entity22			2
it was the first time a reigning queen and three generations of heirs were photographed together in more than 100 years			0
while prince @entity4 and the @entity6 are busy with royal obligations , @entity22 is cared for by what some would call a supernanny			1
@entity103 - born @entity102 was trained at the prestigious and selective @entity104 in @entity105 , which specializes in training nannies			2
there she learned everything from basic child care to defensive driving and even self - defense			1
this nanny not only has to handle diaper changes , she also has to worry about potential kidnap attempts and invasive paparazzi			0
in his first year , he 's embarked on an international tour and made quite the fashion statement			0
@entity22 has had a lot of firsts this year , and many of them were in the public eye			0
the royal baby tagged along in april with his mom and dad on their first family trip abroad in @entity129 and @entity130			1
the 9 - month - old followed in the footsteps of his father , who was the first heir to be brought along on a royal trip at such a young age when his own parents toured @entity130 and @entity129 in 1983			2
after his overseas adventures , the public saw @entity22 once again on @entity139			0
but instead of the spotlight shining on his doting dad it was once again on baby @entity22 , who took his first steps in public , carefully holding on to his mom for balance			0
not only that , the overalls he was wearing immediately sold out worldwide			0
