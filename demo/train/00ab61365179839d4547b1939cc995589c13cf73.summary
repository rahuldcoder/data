-- as the dust settled after the latest agreement was struck to solve the @entity6 debt crisis , @entity2 president @entity1 admitted it had been a " mistake " to admit the stricken @entity7 into the monetary union			1
" let 's be clear ; it was a mistake , " @entity1 told @entity2 television			2
" @entity7 came into the @entity12 with numbers that were false and its economy was not prepared to assume an integration into the @entity6			2
it was a decision that was taken in , i believe , 2001 , for which we now are paying the consequence			0
" wednesday 's agreement , reached in @entity23 , will slash @entity7 debt , recapitalize @entity26 banks and more than double the @entity29 bailout fund 's resources to handle future sovereign defaults			1
" it 's great news that we 've got an agreement , " said @entity32 economist @entity31			0
" when @entity26 puts its heads together , they do actually begin to cooperate			0
" however speculation is rife about @entity41 's role in the success of the plan , with suggestions they will provide capital to bolster the euro -- a scenario @entity1 has no qualms about			1
" if the @entity41 , who have 60 % of global reserves , decide to invest in the euro instead of the dollar , why refuse ? " he asked			0
@entity41 has welcomed the @entity56 consensus , whose main elements include a 50 % reduction in the value of @entity7 government bonds , steps recapitalize @entity26 banks and plans to attract capital for the already overburdened @entity65 rescue fund , in order to reduce @entity7 debt from the current astronomical 160 % of its current economy to 120 % of total economic output over the next 10 years			1
@entity41 indicated that it may be in its best interest to contribute to a solution , although made no mention of specific plans to do so			0
" we believe that , as the largest economy in the world , the steady , sound , and healthy growth of the @entity29 economy and the @entity6 is vital to the world economy 's recovery , " @entity75 spokeswoman @entity74 said at a regular press briefing on thursday			0
" we are also ready to work with the @entity29 to overcome the difficulty			0
" but @entity41 support would depend on @entity26 's ability to guarantee the safety of any investment , @entity85 , a member of @entity41 's @entity86 , told the @entity91			2
" it is in @entity41 's long - term and intrinsic interest to help @entity26 because they are our biggest trading partner but the chief concern of the @entity41 government is how to explain this decision to our own people , " @entity85 said			1
@entity85 added that @entity41 could use fiscal support as leverage to deter @entity26 from criticizing @entity41 's currency policy , which is often criticized for being undervalued and unfairly benefiting @entity41 exports			2
@entity26 hopes to attract capital from sovereign wealth funds , particularly from developing nations like @entity41 and @entity107 , to supplement the â ‚ ¬ 440 billion rescue fund , but analysts note that the structure of these investments remains unknown			1
in a phone conversation with @entity1 on thursday , @entity41 president @entity113 made no mention of specific plans to invest in the scheme , but lauded @entity26 's progress in solving the debt crisis			1
the leaders discussed plans for the upcoming @entity124 , with @entity113 saying the annual meeting had become a platform for cleaning up the global economy and that he hopes it can continue to adhere to the spirit of cooperation and common success , @entity41 's state - run @entity121 news agency reported			0
" it is not in @entity41 's interest to fund this scheme , " @entity132 , chief economist at @entity133 told @entity134			2
" it is better advised to sit this out and buy assets at liquidation than to invest in a sinking ship			0
