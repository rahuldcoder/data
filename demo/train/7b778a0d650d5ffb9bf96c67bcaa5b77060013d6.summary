-- the riskiest , trickiest , friskiest movie you can see right now happens to be a documentary			1
do n't let that put you off			0
this is the story of an ambitious @entity8 entrepreneur who buys himself diplomatic immunity for less than $ 200,000			0
that would be @entity12 agent provocateur @entity11 , who greases several palms in a bid to get himself appointed the @entity16 ambassador to the @entity17			1
and why would anyone want to do that ? well , if you think @entity16 could use some governmental oversight , wait until you see what goes on in the @entity17			0
while most of the populace is mired in poverty , let 's not forget that this former @entity28 colony is also home to some of the world 's richest diamond fields ( which is where diplomatic status proves an invaluable investment )			1
we 're used to seeing intrepid reporters digging out a story , but bribing officials to smuggle out blood diamonds ? that 's not something @entity42 would have done , surely ? @entity11 is short and bald , very white , and with a ginger goatee			1
in his previous film , " @entity50 , " he sneaked a peek into @entity46 under the guise of filming a theatrical troupe on a cultural exchange			0
here he dresses the part of a colonial martinet : tight jackets , jodhpurs , riding boots , and even affects a cigarette holder			0
he makes " humorous " remarks about @entity58 in an effort to ingratiate himself with his new friends -- a ploy that works quite well , actually -- and liberally distributes what he calls " little envelopes of happiness " to smooth the way for his business proposal , a plan to build a match factory staffed by the country 's pygmy tribe			1
this is his cover story , a fig leaf for his smuggling plans , and an illustration of the kind of development that might genuinely help the indigenous peoples			0
but it 's also a cruel hoax on the pygmies he meets , collateral damage in his bid to expose their corrupt political masters and the international diplomatic classes who feed off them			2
@entity11 is playing with dynamite here			0
the closest comparison may be @entity91 's knife - edge satirical rubes			1
the film is often very funny even if you feel lousy about laughing -- except that @entity91 has n't put his own neck on the line like this			1
@entity97 can be a dangerous place at the best of times			0
for a long while @entity11 is marooned there ( his documentation has not come through , and in fairness to @entity16 's authorities , it never does ) , and if he needs any reminder of what could go wrong , it all comes crashing home when one of his interviewees is assassinated			2
the movie 's last 20 minutes play like a real - life @entity112 spy thriller : the wheels start to come off the deceit and we have to wonder if he 'll be able to extricate himself without serious injury			1
" the ambassador " is a damning movie on almost every level			1
you might have serious reservations about his methods , but you ca n't fault the man 's nerve			2
it 's extraordinary just how many illicit conversations with important men @entity11 manages to get on camera			2
already the @entity16 president has called for an inquiry , though there seems little likelihood of similar soul - searching in the @entity17			0
in any case , @entity11 has given his testimony and issued his indictments , too .			0

the *filmmaker* plays at a game of deceit to uncover corruption
closest comparison may be @entity91 's knife - edge satirical rubes
" the ambassador " is a damning movie on almost every level
