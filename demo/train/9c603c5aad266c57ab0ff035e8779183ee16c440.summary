@entity0 -- @entity3 officials blocked liberals and people with @entity7 ties from a highly selective program that funneled young lawyers into government jobs , according to an internal investigation released tuesday			1
a bias against liberals existed in a justice program meant to hire young lawyers , an investigation found			1
@entity26 , a political appointee at the @entity3 , " wrote disparaging statements about the candidates ' liberal and @entity7 affiliations on the applications she reviewed and ... she voted to deselect candidates on that basis , " said the report by inspector general @entity17			1
@entity26 , who has left the department , refused to be interviewed for the investigation			0
the report , the first official investigation to document politicization of the @entity3 during the @entity32 administration , is an offshoot of the larger investigation of @entity3 politics triggered by the furor over the firing of nine @entity40 attorneys			1
it found two of three members of a screening committee considered political views and experience when choosing new lawyers for the @entity47 and @entity48			1
the report found that @entity26 and @entity50 , the chief of staff to deputy attorney general @entity51 , engaged in misconduct , an administrative violation			0
the third member of the screening committee , career lawyer @entity54 , was cleared of any involvement in the politicization of the process			2
@entity50 was interviewed by the investigators , who asked him about the role of former @entity3 official @entity61 in politicizing the selection process			2
@entity50 told investigators he could not recall @entity61 telling him to select lawyers who appeared to share attorney general @entity66 ' philosophy			2
@entity61 testified before a @entity68 panel last year that she had told @entity50 he should identify such candidates			0
@entity61 directed @entity50 to lead the selection committee in 2006			1
she and @entity50 have both left the @entity3			0
she refused to be interviewed for the inspector general 's report			0
as a result of the controversy , the hiring process was changed in 2007 to insulate hiring decisions from political considerations			1
both @entity3 policy and federal law prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of political affiliations			2
the report did not find clear evidence that an earlier screening committee took political considerations into account			2
it says data from 2002 shows a disparity in the hiring of liberal and conservative candidates , but there were no complaints about the committee 's work from 2003 to 2006 , when @entity61 put @entity50 in charge of the process			1
the report tuesday is the first of perhaps several to be issued as the broad - ranging investigation into the role partisan politics has played in the @entity3 during the @entity32 administration			0
@entity61 is expected to be a central figure in later inspector general reports examining efforts to increase the influence of conservatives in the department			0
the @entity3 @entity113 , a separate watchdog office that monitors prosecutorial conduct , joined in the inspector general 's investigation			0
@entity1 's @entity117 contributed to this report .			0
