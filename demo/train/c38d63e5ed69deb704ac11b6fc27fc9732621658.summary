-- look , i 'm not saying i 'm a cheap bastard			1
i 'm also not saying i 'm a soulless ginger			2
mind you , both are true			2
i 'm just not saying it			0
but to the first point , it 's necessary to clarify that , despite the fact i 've been known to show signs of lupus over the occasional restaurant bill , i 'm actually an excellent tipper			1
as for everything else in life , i 'm mediocre at best			0
so , this week we 're going to talk about gratuity			1
and it all stems from a recent trending discovery on the interwebs about something called the @entity23			1
now , i do n't throw the word " genius " around too liberally			1
generally , i save it for really important stuff like when a friend suggests we light something on fire			0
but i 'm going to go ahead and drop a g - bomb on this amazing new invention			1
because , for better or worse , when it comes to tipping , the @entity23 is an absolute game changer			1
i 've been known to get things wrong			0
" @entity37 " is still around			0
basically , the @entity23 is an electronic tip jar for store countertops in which a customer can -- as the name suggests -- dip his or her credit card to leave a fixed - amount tip for the clerk			1
and these days it 's sort of a necessity increasingly , we are becoming a cash - free society , preferring the convenience of credit cards to carrying actual paper money			1
while this can be great for the consumer , it sort of screws over the hipster barista behind the counter who no longer gets to keep your change			0
but , hey , he still has giant - gauged ear holes			1
not only is cash becoming less popular , but it also seems that more and more credit card companies do n't even require a signature for small transactions , thus eliminating the opportunity to write in a tip or , perhaps , leave that really cute server an adorable pickup line			1
" i 'm so alone			0
" i almost never carry cash			0
@entity75 , for me , it has less to do with convenience , and everything to do with racking up airline miles i 'm sort of obsessed			0
so much so , that when i actually go to book a flight i do n't even use the miles i have			0
it 's unquestionably because i 'm a complete idiot , and figure why drop 40,000 miles to fly for free when i could spend $ 500 and get ... more miles ? @entity83 pretty much has me by the gonads			2
i get to board in @entity87			0
and these are the things that matter to soulless gingers			0
anyway , @entity23 finally makes it easy for credit card users to tip without signing , and the company makes their money by taking a small percentage of each transaction			1
however , they insist that they 'll always deliver at least 80 cents of every dollar to the store 's employees			2
some people might say this is unfairly taking money from the people who actually earned it , but the counter-argument ( pun absolutely intended because i 'm awesome ) is that this is money they probably would n't have seen in the first place			0
i suppose there 's no right answer here , but we should probably all get unnecessarily worked up and leave hateful , anonymous comments for each other			2
i 'll start : " this writer sucks ! " the future , of course , is cell phones where you either tap - to - pay or maybe just command @entity122 to do something useful for a change			2
" @entity122 , pay the man			0
" " where are your pants ? " " shut up , @entity122			0
" but , for now , until our cell phones officially take over the world , the @entity23 seems to be a decent intermediary			1
that said , we still have to ask : who actually deserves a @entity23 in the first place ? these days , it seems like everyone is soliciting tips			1
and i legitimately do n't know who should get them			0
naturally , we have the old standards			0
servers get 15 % to 20 %			2
bartenders get a dollar a drink			0
and the guy who hooks me up with illegal @entity149 gets 20 bucks and a @entity150			0
but as i spoke to people this week about tipping , and as i researched the topic online , there seemed to be a huge overall backlash against leaving money for anyone with an actual tip jar			1
read : people who might use the @entity23			1
the general consensus was that , in food service , if you physically come to the table with my meal you get a tip. the frozen yogurt girl , on the other hand , can go die in a ditch			1
of course , tipping is n't unique to @entity170			0
but it certainly seems to be a bigger part of our culture than in other countries			0
for example , in the @entity170 we even take care of the taxi driver in the same way we tip a restaurant server			2
and it 's kind of insane			1
" here 's an extra five bucks for talking on your blue tooth for the last 30 minutes			2
you 're the best ! " for comparison , in @entity186 , riders tip , but only a small amount			2
in fact , while on assignment in @entity191 before the @entity192 , i actually spoke to a taxi driver about proper etiquette , and he told me it 's polite to just round up the fare -- that the normal tip is about 50 pence ( or roughly 80 cents )			1
he said , " you do n't look towards a tip , but it 's nice when you do get one			1
" the moral of the story is never leave your house			0
but for those who do wander and buy stuff , the @entity23 is definitely a clever idea			1
still , i seriously do n't know who should get a tip these days			2
so help me sort this out			0
who 's worthy ? and , more importantly , has anyone seen the frozen yogurt girl ?			1

" @entity219 " is @entity217 's weekly , off - *kilter* look at the social web
this week , @entity221 *ponders* the @entity23
the " genius " *product* lets credit card users tip their servers -- or whoever
be kind to your frozen yogurt vendor . seriously .
