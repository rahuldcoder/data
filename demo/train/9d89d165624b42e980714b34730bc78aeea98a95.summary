the black - clad , masked @entity2 @entity1 terrorist who has taken center stage in the group 's hostage videos appeared in a new video on tuesday threatening the lives of two @entity10 hostages , @entity11 and @entity12			1
the terrorist explained that they would be executed in 72 hours if @entity1 is n't paid $ 200 million			1
@entity10 prime minister @entity14 responded on tuesday saying the treatment of the hostages was " unacceptable			1
" @entity1 had similarly demanded 100 million euros ( roughly $ 132.5 million ) in ransom for the release of @entity19 , the @entity20 journalist who was killed by the terrorist group in @entity22 in august			1
like the $ 200 million demand for the @entity10 hostages , the @entity19 demand was never a serious negotiation effort as it far exceeded the amounts of money paid for hostages held by jihadist militant groups in the past , which typically have ranged up to several million dollars			1
but the demand does shine a light on two uncomfortable facts about " @entity34 , " or @entity37 , the dark netherworld of professionals who work to negotiate between murderous groups such as @entity1 and the terrified families whose loved ones have been kidnapped			1
it also includes their worried employers and @entity46 governments such as @entity47 that will pay ransoms , and other governments , notably the @entity20 and the @entity2 , that will not			0
the first uncomfortable fact is that if you pay a ransom , a hostage is more likely to be released			2
the other is that every time a ransom is paid it increases the chance that other hostages will be taken to help fill the coffers of a terrorist group			1
according to an investigation by @entity64 , @entity61 and its affiliates have netted at least $ 125 million in ransoms since 2008			1
that finding is similar to a 2012 @entity68 estimate that $ 120 million had been paid to terrorist organizations during the previous eight years			2
much of this revenue reportedly comes from @entity47			0
@entity47 media reported that the government had paid 20 million euros ( about $ 28 million , reflecting last year 's exchange rate ) for the release of four employees of a @entity47 nuclear firm			2
they were held by an @entity61 affiliate for three years in northern @entity79 and were released last year			0
the @entity47 government denied paying a ransom , but the @entity64 indicated -- based on reports from @entity83 and @entity84 -- that @entity47 did pay in that case and has paid out a total of some $ 58 million to @entity61 or related groups			1
opinion : why countries should think about paying ransoms not surprisingly , the @entity64 also found that of the 53 hostages known to have been taken by @entity61 and its affiliates during the past five years , a third were @entity47			2
the @entity47 government 's purported policy of negotiating with militant groups for the release of kidnapped citizens does appear to work			0
four @entity47 journalists -- @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 , who were kidnapped in @entity22 last year by @entity1 -- were released near the @entity106 border in april , blindfolded and with their hands bound			2
one of those hostages , @entity109 , had been held by @entity1 alongside @entity19			1
@entity109 is free , and @entity19 is dead			0
these are the facts that policymakers must confront as they consider what to do about the other @entity46 hostages still held by @entity1			1
so far , @entity1 has executed a number of @entity46 hostages , including @entity20 journalist @entity116 , and @entity20 aid worker @entity117			1
@entity1 continues to holds one @entity20 female aid worker			2
@entity6 is withholding her name			0
for the hostages held by @entity1 , there is always the chance that their governments will mount a rescue operation as the @entity20 did in @entity22 in july 2014 to try and rescue @entity19 and the other @entity20			1
that mission failed because the hostages had been moved from a location they had been kept in for some months			2
there is also the possibility that hostages could escape , as @entity20 photographer @entity131 did last year when he managed to crawl out of a window of the prison where he was being held in in the @entity22 city of @entity136 by an @entity138 militant group			0
but such escapes are rare , and while successful rescue efforts do happen , they are fraught with risks for the hostages			0
@entity147 , for instance , a @entity2 aid worker held by the @entity144 in @entity145 in 2010 , was killed in a @entity20 rescue operation , likely by a grenade that exploded near her			0
if there 's not an escape or a successful rescue effort , @entity46 governments whose citizens are held by @entity1 have only the options of either a negotiation involving ransom or the real possibility that their hostages may be executed			1
this is the sobering choice that has faced president @entity164 and his national security advisers and now faces the @entity10 prime minister			2
last year , @entity164 ordered a review of @entity20 hostage policy , which is never to negotiate with terrorists			0
the review is reportedly supposed to examine issues such as " family engagement , intelligence collection , and diplomatic engagement policies			0
" but that seems to be rather missing the point			0
the real issue is : will a ransom be paid , or not ? an area of possible wiggle room would be to leave the door open so that ransoms for @entity20 could be allowed to be paid -- not with @entity20 government funds but with private donations			0
in such a case , the government would simply look the other way when private donations were used to free an @entity20 hostage , as paying money to a designated terrorist organization is a crime in the @entity20			0
this is the least bad solution to a terrible quandary , which is if that if you do n't pay the ransom the hostage dies , and if you do pay the ransom , you are helping a terrorist organization .			0

@entity200 , @entity201 : @entity1 seeking $ 200 million for two @entity10 hostages ' freedom
sometimes ransom works , but it can lead to more kidnapping , the *writers* say
