-- @entity4 justice @entity3 was a binge drinker who had a pornography habit or fetish in the 1980s , then changed radically when he stopped drinking alcohol , his former girlfriend told @entity0 on monday			1
@entity10 , who dated @entity3 for several years before he was nominated to the @entity4 in 1991 , provided @entity0 's " @entity12 " program with a harsh depiction of @entity3			1
she said when they first met , he might have been a " raving alcoholic " who used pornography to help fulfill sexual fantasies , but then gave up drinking and transformed into an angry , obsessive man who bullied his son			0
@entity12 said during the program that @entity3 ' office declined offers to comment on the topics of the interview			1
@entity3 almost had his @entity4 nomination derailed when another woman , @entity27 , accused him of sexual harassment when they worked together in the 1980s at the @entity31 @entity30 and then the @entity32			1
during his @entity34 confirmation hearing , @entity3 angrily denied any improper behavior involving @entity27 , calling the allegations a form of lynching			2
@entity10 , a former prosecutor and administrative law judge who has written her own memoir and is seeking a publisher , said she believed @entity27 's account of sexually suggestive statements by @entity3 because of his use of pornography			1
" i suppose i would call it a fetish or a hobby , " she said of @entity3			2
" it was something that was very important to him , something that he talked about			0
" she said the pornography bored her and she would n't watch pornographic videos with him , but she also said she enabled his fantasies tied to the pornography " because we had a sexual relationship			0
" " i did n't disapprove of it			0
i just did n't care , " @entity10 said			2
according to @entity10 , @entity3 underwent a major personality change when he gave up alcohol that eventually caused her to leave the relationship			1
" @entity3 became not the person i knew when i first met him , " she said , adding that he " drank to excess " when they first met and might have been a " raving alcoholic " at that time			2
when he gave up alcohol , she said , he became " angry , short - tempered , asexual " and obsessive with ambition and what she called " weird things , " such as long runs in the dark before dawn			0
asked if she believed back then he was qualified to reach his goal of being a @entity4 justice , @entity10 said it was a difficult question and cited " instability , " a " lack of intellectual curiosity , " and trouble with concentrating when reading for a long time as issues about @entity3 that would make it difficult to do the job			1
@entity3 " went backwards " during the time she knew him and became a bully to his son , @entity10 said , and she added that she once turned him down when @entity3 asked if he and his son could move in with her			1
eventually , @entity10 said , " it was time for me to go			2
" @entity3 is one of the most conservative justices on the nine - member @entity4 , and is known for rarely if ever asking questions during hearings			0
to @entity10 , his conservative rulings amount to a kind of revenge fueled by anger against liberals who he believes turned against him			0
" his enemies are people who are active in civil rights , professors who have criticized him and anybody who disagrees with the conservative friends that he has such as @entity99 , " she said			0
@entity10 had never spoken publicly about her relationship with @entity3 until the recent revelation that @entity3 ' wife , conservative activist @entity102 , left a voicemail for @entity27 asking her to apologize for her 1991 testimony at the confirmation hearing			1
according to @entity10 , she was " tricked " by a @entity107 reporter into commenting on the @entity102 phone call to @entity27 and decided is was time to come forward with her story			0
