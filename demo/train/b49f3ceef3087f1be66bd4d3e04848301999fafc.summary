president @entity0 will renew his push for paid sick days and paid family leave for the millions of @entity5 workers who do n't have either during a visit to @entity7 on thursday , according to @entity8 , senior adviser to the president			1
@entity10 , who used an unconventional outlet to outline @entity0 's expected announcements -- in a blog for @entity14 -- said the president will call on @entity16 to pass the @entity17 , which would allow millions of @entity5 to earn up to seven days per year of paid sick time			1
@entity0 pushes for universal broadband access " how many @entity5 have to show up to work when battling an illness even when they know they wo n't be at their best , it will lengthen their recovery time , and they may likely spread their sickness to others ? " wrote @entity10			2
" the last thing we should do is add guilt , fear , and financial hardship on working parents as they try to do what 's right -- while keeping their job , " she added			0
more than 40 % of private sector workers in the @entity5 currently do n't get paid sick days , according to the @entity37			1
during a lunch with a group of women in @entity7 , the president will also call on cities and states to pass similar laws at the local level			2
in 2006 , @entity46 became the first city in the nation to guarantee access to earned sick days , and in 2011 , @entity50 became the first state to mandate the benefit , according to the @entity53			0
in the november election , the @entity53 said voters approved paid sick leave ballot measures in @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 and @entity61 , @entity62			1
can @entity0 's community college plan get through @entity16 ? the president will also announce programs to help cities and states provide paid leave to @entity5 workers			1
currently , under the @entity69 , workers are eligible for 12 weeks of unpaid leave for specific family and medical reasons , such as the birth of a child or caring for an ill parent			2
many employers , including the federal government , do not pay for that leave			0
in his 2015 budget , the president will propose $ 2.2 billion to reimburse up to five states for three years for their costs associated with implementing a paid leave policy , $ 35 million in grants to states and $ 1 million through the @entity86 for feasibility studies around providing paid leave programs , @entity10 told @entity1			2
last year , the president 's budget included $ 500,000 for feasibility studies , which three states and the @entity93 used to help craft what will become paid leave programs , she added			1
at the federal level , the president will also sign a presidential memorandum directing his agencies to allow federal employees to have access to at least six weeks of paid leave when a new child arrives or to care for ill family members , and propose that @entity16 offer six weeks of paid administrative leave as well , said @entity10			1
the push for paid sick days and paid leave stems , in part , from last year 's first - ever @entity108 , said @entity10			1
" the conversation we had that day was only the beginning			0
it has carried on in the months since then around the country and the president has continued to take action to make progress for families , " she said			0
@entity10 also wrote directly about why the @entity108 chose @entity14 to reveal the news about the president 's push for paid sick and family leave , saying the social networking site was in " the best position to drive change			1
" " this is the world 's largest online audience of professionals			0
and if you 're an employer , the folks who are coming to your company 's pages will be looking to see if you offer precisely these sorts of policies on your books , " wrote @entity10			0
" keep in mind that nearly 1 - in - 2 working parents has turned down a job because it would not work for their family			0
do n't let your job be one of those , " she said			0
opinion : leisure is the new productivity			0
