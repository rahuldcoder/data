" it 's why the @entity2 people hate @entity3			2
unlike the people in @entity3 , we have actual responsibilities			2
" @entity8 gov. @entity7 dropped a bomb on @entity11 house speaker @entity10 and @entity3 for refusing to allow a vote on @entity14 relief in the final hours of the 112th @entity3			1
it was an instant classic of principled political outrage			0
it provided a strong dose of what @entity19 has been missing : blunt , independent leadership			0
@entity7 prosecuted the case by pointing out that hurricane relief had been provided more quickly to others : for victims of @entity26 after 10 days and victims of @entity28 in @entity29 after 30 days			1
but residents of the @entity8 and @entity32 coast have been waiting 65 days to date for some relief			0
@entity7 also accurately pointed out that @entity35 states such as @entity8 and @entity32 send more to the federal government in taxes than they get back in federal aid , unlike many of the red states represented by conservatives in @entity3			1
the " makers versus takers " narratives fall apart fast when confronted with reality			0
pulling no punches , @entity7 declared : " last night , the @entity48 majority failed most basic test of leadership and they did so with callous disregard to the people of my state			1
... it was disappointing and disgusting to watch			0
" he also unapologetically named names : " there 's only one group to blame ... the @entity48 majority , and their speaker , @entity10			1
" he added that the relief bill " just could not overcome the toxic internal politics of the @entity48 majority			2
" but @entity7 also took the high road in terms of decrying the overall atmosphere of hyperpartisanship in @entity19 , arguing correctly that " @entity2 are tired of the palace intrigue and political partisanship of this @entity3 ... this used to be something that was not political			2
disaster relief was something that you did n't play games with			0
" politics : republicans reverse outrage , pledge to back @entity10 @entity7 's broadside drew widespread praise on the @entity80			1
one tweet i saw from " @entity83 " in @entity84 seemed typical : " his dedication to his state is inspiring			0
i 'm a democrat but damn , @entity7 's won me over			2
he has a damn heart			0
" @entity7 's fury was backed up by similar straight talk from @entity32 @entity92 congressman @entity92 of @entity93			1
he blasted @entity48 leadership on @entity95 wednesday morning : " i would say the @entity11 has said it is the party of family values , " he said			1
" last night it turned its back on the most essential value of all , and that is to provide food , shelter , clothing and relief for people who have been hit by a natural disaster			0
and i would say that the @entity11 has turned its back on those people			2
" this display of independence was a reminder that there is a distinct brand of tough @entity114 -- people such as @entity7 , @entity92 and @entity116 -- who do n't simply toe the line with party leadership or ideological litmus tests			1
largely as a result , they are able to connect with centrists and independent voters and win on @entity126 turf			0
this is a lesson for national republicans as they look to reach out beyond their base			0
@entity7 and @entity92 's principled independence and tough talk against their own party leadership brought results			1
within hours , @entity10 and @entity11 @entity48 leadership announced that they would vote for an initial round of @entity14 relief on friday , followed by a vote on the remaining amount on january 15			1
conservative activist groups such as @entity143 , the @entity144 and @entity145 all pressured congressional republicans to vote against @entity14 relief , and while they helped block a bill from coming to a vote on @entity151 , the swift and unsubtle backlash brought a wise reassessment			1
all this is a reminder that straight talk in politics is so rare that it stands out and carries more than its own weight in civic debates			0
it cuts through the spin and resonates beyond party lines because it is credible and rooted in reality			0
most importantly , it gets results			2
@entity10 's turnaround brought to mind a comment made by @entity7 during his press conference : " no one is beyond redemption			1
" follow @ @entity171 on twitter			0

@entity7 blasted speaker @entity10 over failing to vote on @entity14 aid
@entity176 : conservative groups had pressured @entity11 not to *approve* the aid
he says @entity7 pointed out long *lag* in *approving* aid to the @entity35
@entity176 : @entity7 and rep. @entity92 got results , as @entity48 *agreed* to *schedule* votes
