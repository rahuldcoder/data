-- spiraling into oblivion really helps you see things from a different perspective			2
at sunday night 's premiere of " gravity , " @entity5 said she felt she did n't deserve the @entity8 when she won it for " @entity9 " three years ago — and now her performance as an astronaut stranded in orbit when space debris demolishes her shuttle could win her another one			1
the survival drama , out oct. 4 , got an intense reaction as the @entity19 's opening weekend drew to a close , with many marveling at both the technical and emotional achievements of director @entity24 ( " @entity26 , " " @entity25 " and the " @entity27			1
" ) expect " gravity " to be a major player at the @entity8 this year in all the top categories			1
it should easily win in the visual effects category , and will be a heavy - duty competitor in the others			2
@entity5 is also a near certain @entity5 nominee , although she said her 2010 win still has n't sunk in			1
" i think most people have that out - of - body experience when they win the @entity8			1
i had a little newborn at home , so my body was already out of itself , " @entity5 said in response to a question about awards season during the post-screening q&a with festival - goers			1
" i still have n't gotten around to having my moment with it yet			1
maybe one day it will come			2
" she 'll face formidable opponents in the race			2
@entity51 in @entity52 , @entity53 in " @entity54 , " and @entity55 from " @entity56 " are among the potential nominees generating voter buzz			0
@entity5 said awards talk is just part of the fun of festivals , and tried to put the coveted prize in a more grounded context			1
" what it does do is make you realize how hard you have to work to earn it , " she said			0
" i did n't feel worthy of it when i got it			1
so i thought , okay , i 'm going to spend the rest of my life hopefully earning it --- but having a really good time in the process , as well			0
" except the making " gravity " was ... anything but fun			1
since the film is set in orbit , she was often strung up on wires , or locked in a device that spun her wildly in different directions while multiple cameras shot close ups of her face			1
that footage was later woven into photo - real animation of her and @entity88 in jeopardy , floating far above the @entity90			0
" it was painful , i remember			0
not for me -- but for you , " @entity24 said			0
@entity5 did n't hesitate to agree			1
" @entity96 , " she said , imitating his accent as she explained to the crowd : " that 's ' yes			0
' " whenever she got frustrated , she would mock his @entity99 accent , @entity24 said			0
" it was frustrating , it was painful , and it was isolating			0
but how lucky am i that i got to have all those frustrations , you know , built in ? " @entity5 told the crowd			1
" that 's something people who are in the position these characters are in [ would be ] experiencing a thousand-fold			0
" that did n't mean she let @entity110 or @entity111 ( producer of the " @entity25 " films ) escape a little of the agony			2
" after a while you just used it			0
and you wanted to kill @entity111 and @entity24 regularly , and i used that as well , " she joked			0
" just all your hate , and anger , and rage -- you just give forth in your work , and hope it translates on the screen			0
" @entity88 did n't attend the screening ( he 's on the other side of @entity126 shooting director @entity129 's " @entity128 " in @entity127			2
) but most of the movie is focused on @entity5 's character anyway , with @entity88 in a supporting turn as the captain of the space shuttle			1
turning serious , @entity5 said there was one part of the role that was particularly special to her			1
" it was an amazing experience to do as an actor , but i think more importantly as a woman , " she said , thanking @entity139 , who wrote the script with his son , @entity141			0
" it could have very easily [ become ] the role of a man			2
