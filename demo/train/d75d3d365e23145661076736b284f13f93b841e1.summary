-- @entity1 has every reason to feel good as " @entity4 " opens in theaters			1
reviews are strong for the @entity8 - directed @entity7 biopic as a whole , but critics have been particularly pleased with @entity1 , who 's managed to transform himself into the late @entity7			1
" whatever else one may fault about ' @entity4 , ' one thing that 's faultless is its star , @entity1 , who plays @entity7 from age 16 to 60 with a dexterity and invention worthy of his subject , " praised @entity17			1
@entity18 , which thought " @entity4 's " pg - 13 take is too sanitized , was quick to add that " the best thing the movie has going for it is @entity1 's live - wire channeling of @entity7			1
" such words are likely comforting for @entity1 , who , after portraying baseball icon @entity24 in 2013 's " 42 , " was hesitant to take on another biopic , let alone one for a man as seminal as @entity7			1
" when i first saw the script , i was like , i 'm not even going to open it up and read it			0
there 's no way i 'm playing @entity7 , " he told the " today " show , adding that he knew the work it would take to accurately portray @entity7			2
the @entity0 10 : @entity1 , and nine more " @entity35 " " i had to do a lot of soul - searching before i took it on , " @entity1 admitted to @entity18			2
" because to me , nobody should be playing @entity7			0
" according to @entity41 , director @entity8 , who had another summer hit in 2011 with " the help , " spent two months convincing 32 - year - old @entity1 to take the part			0
" i realized that first and foremost , i had to find a brilliant actor , " @entity8 told @entity41			0
" it 's easy to gravitate toward the costumes and the dancing , but i just realized that somebody was going to have to play a 63 - year - old , and that 's what i had him read for			0
so i just searched for an actor with skill , and @entity1 was the guy			2
" to a certain extent , telling @entity7 's story was n't dissimilar to telling @entity24 's			2
in both instances , @entity1 had to put in hours to effectively portray game - changing talent			0
those dance moves you 've seen him do in the " @entity4 " trailers ? the result of five - hour practice sessions five days a week , not to mention what he put in during his downtime			0
" i was obsessed with it , " @entity1 told " today			0
" the effort appears to have paid off as " @entity4 " opens friday , and some are already eyeing @entity69 season			1
" as much as i hate using the @entity75 word seven months before the @entity69 , " said @entity71 critic @entity70 , who credited @entity1 with " carrying and lifting ' @entity4 ' to its most impressive heights , " " i 'm obliged to predict an aisle seat for @entity1 on @entity69 night			1

@entity1 portrays @entity7 in the biopic " @entity4 "
critics are praising his *performance*
at first the actor did n't want to take the role
at least one critic raises the *possibility* of an @entity69 *nod*
