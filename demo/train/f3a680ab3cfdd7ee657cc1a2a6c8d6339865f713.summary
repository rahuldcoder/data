@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a dusty , unkempt field in the middle of @entity1 's second - largest city , crowds of men and boys gather to watch their favorite sport			1
but there is something most unusual about this sight , even in such a cricket - crazy nation			1
on this particular field , the men and boys are the spectators and the girls are the ones wielding bats and bowling balls			2
" i have never seen girls playing cricket anywhere in @entity1 before , " remarks a male watching on the sidelines			1
that is because girls are n't normally given the chance to play			1
they are generally given less value in society than boys			0
@entity1 launches @entity31 " at first people asked : ' why are girls playing cricket			1
it 's a boys ' game , this is a bad thing , ' " 15 - year - old @entity35 said			1
in the slum where she lives , the neighbors taunted her father , saying he was ruining their religiously - conservative society by allowing his girl to play			1
he almost gave in to their demands			0
" then i thought that i could not do anything in my life , so let my daughter do something , " @entity35 's father @entity46 said			2
he was never given the chance to go to school			0
but instead of marrying his daughter off at the age of 14 -- the age his wife married him -- he allowed @entity35 to take classes in a school run by @entity58 , @entity1 's largest non-governmental organization			1
he was impressed with his daughter 's work and even learned a few things from her			2
" i could not sign my name before , but i started learning from my daughter and now i can write my name and some others ' names , " @entity46 said			0
so a year and a half ago , when @entity58 decided to start a girls ' cricket team with funding from @entity69 , @entity35 convinced her parents and went from a shy teenager to the captain of her team			1
" @entity74 willing someday i will be able to play on the national team , " she said			0
there are dozens of girls like her , and now there are enough teams in @entity1 to have a national tournament			1
there is only enough money to hold a handful of formal training sessions from volunteer coaches , but the girls take what they can and work with it			0
coach @entity90 beams when he remembers the hardships the girls have overcome			0
" i am very proud ! my team is not playing very well but we have been able to bring the team from so far with the help of @entity58			0
it 's a miracle ! " but the proudest of all is @entity35 's father : " i am now happy she is learning and she is playing			0
i am delighted with this thing			0
people from all across @entity1 watch her play -- she 's our pride			1
" no matter if the girls ' teams win or lose a match			2
their supporters say they have already aced some life 's biggest tests			0
with the @entity113 being kicked off in @entity1 , @entity35 has gained enough confidence and support to dream even bigger now			2
" i will definitely feel good when we see girls like us playing in the @entity31			0

girls are breaking down social *barriers* by starting to play cricket in @entity1
the sport has long been *dominated* by males in the cricket - crazy nation
@entity1 's religious code has made it difficult for *females* to play the game
but despite a lack of coaching *resources* , girls ' teams are starting to *flourish*
