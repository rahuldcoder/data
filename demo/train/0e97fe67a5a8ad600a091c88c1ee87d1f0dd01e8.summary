@entity51 , ranked by @entity53 as @entity8 's fifth richest man , with an estimated net worth of $ 5.7 billion , adopted the cause after his daughter volunteered in an orphanage in @entity39 in 2008 , where she encountered victims of child sex trafficking			1
@entity51 is a signatory to the @entity63 started by billionaire investor @entity64 , whose members commit to donating at least half their wealth to philanthropic causes			0
the index , which draws on 10 years of research into slavery and was produced by a team of 4 authors supported by 22 other experts , is the inaugural edition of what will be an annual report			1
it ranks 162 countries according to the number of people living in slavery , the risk of enslavement and the robustness of government responses to the problem			1
@entity7 policy and research manager @entity87 told @entity89 the report was intended to shine a spotlight on the issue , and quantify the extent of the problem in different countries before anti-slavery initiatives were launched			2
so far , she said , @entity7 , along with partners @entity97 and the @entity99 , had pledged a total of $ 100 million to stamp out the practice			2

" we needed that information before we started doing any interventions			0
" the index gives a higher estimate of the global number of slaves than other reports -- a report by the @entity119 last year pegged the number at 20.9 million			1
@entity87 said this was a result of the @entity6 using a broader definition of slavery , which included human trafficking , forced labor , as well as practices such as forced marriage , debt bondage and the exploitation of children			2
" our definition of modern slavery includes , for example , forced and servile marriage , a concept not included in the @entity119 estimate , given the focus on ' forced labor , ' " she said			2
the explicit definition used in the report was " the possession and control of a person in such a way as to significantly deprive that person of his or her individual liberty , with the intent of exploiting that person through their use , management , profit , transfer or disposal			2
usually this exercise will be achieved through means such as violence or threats of violence , deception and / or coercion			0
" @entity164 , one of the report 's authors and co-founder of @entity168 , said that the global number of slaves was difficult to quantify			1
but through methods including random sample surveys , researchers were able to arrive at an estimate			0
" we were able to go to households and say ' has anything like this happened to anyone in your family ? ' " he said			0
he believed the index , which he hoped would provide " a bit of a wake - up call " to the world 's governments , had a margin of error of between 5 - 10 %			0
" we always erred on the conservative side			0
" asked why 30 million continued to live in conditions of slavery in 2013 , @entity87 said the reasons varied from country to country , but one constant was that it remained a " hidden problem			1
" read more : no life for a child -- the grim reality of @entity39 's child laborers in some of the worst - hit countries , the report said , the affected parties were citizens ensnared in endemic , culturally - sanctioned forms of slavery -- " the chattel slavery of the @entity207 in @entity29 , the exploitation of children through the restavek practice in @entity38 , the cultural and economic practices of both caste and debt bondage in @entity9 and @entity13 , and the exploitation of children through vidomegon in @entity218			1
" in other examples , including @entity39 , @entity221 and @entity222 , it was migrants who were most vulnerable to exploitation			1
in many examples , noted the report , child and forced marriage was prevalent and child protection practices weak			0
it noted that in @entity9 , the country with the most slaves , the risk of enslavement varied markedly from state to state			1
@entity236 and @entity237 , it said , showed the highest measured level of discrimination against women , with one result being a high level of forced and child marriages within the region , and widespread exploitation of trafficked women as domestic workers and prostitutes			0
vulnerable male migrants also frequently found themselves in exploitative working conditions			0

" it has a national plan to eradicate slavery			0
it has a dirty list where it has every company that 's ever had slavery pollute their products , they have special anti-slavery police squads			0
" he rejected the suggestion that the term " slavery " was an overly emotive or misleading way of defining people who were trapped by crushing poverty			2
" i spend a lot of time talking to people who have been or are in slavery , and when you talk to them about it , they know what the situation is , " he said			2
" we 're not talking about bad choices , we 're not talking about crummy jobs in a sweatshop			0
we 're talking about real life slavery -- you ca n't walk away , you 're controlled through violence , you 're treated like property			0
