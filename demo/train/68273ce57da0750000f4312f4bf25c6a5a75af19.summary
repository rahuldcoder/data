@entity0 , @entity1 -- with @entity5 out of sight for a month , three @entity4 officials popped down to @entity1 for a last - minute visit saturday			1
and they delivered a diplomatic bonbon			0
the three officials told @entity1 that @entity11 is willing to hold a new round of high - level meetings between late october and early november , @entity1 's @entity9 said in a statement saturday			1
" within my memory ... there was never ever such a high - level visit			1
never , " said @entity4 analyst @entity19 , from @entity0 's @entity20			2
@entity19 said two of the three visitors " are essentially number two and number three in @entity4 official hierarchy			0
" right behind @entity5 , the " @entity27 " himself			1
is @entity4 leader @entity5 lying low ? short notice , extensive media coverage it was a sudden " charm offensive , " @entity19 said			1
and it caused a media flurry , with @entity1 television network @entity33 following the delegation 's moves via extensive live coverage			1
the three gave @entity0 short notice on friday that they were dropping in officially to attend saturday 's closing ceremonies of the @entity40 in the port city of @entity42			2
the @entity1 granted permission the same day to @entity44 - so , vice marshal of the @entity46 , @entity47 - gon and @entity48			1
@entity47 - gon is one of @entity4 's top politicians responsible for dealings with the @entity1			1
@entity48 is the former head of the military but was replaced in may , triggering some speculation in the international press that he may have fallen out of favor with @entity5			1
but @entity1 analysts say that he remains extremely influential			2
he holds a seat as secretary on the @entity59 's @entity58 , @entity11 's highest decision - making body , and commands preeminent authority over civilian affairs			2
@entity48 is also chairman of the @entity63			0
the officials ' @entity40 appearance was followed by a lunch with @entity1 officials , and @entity0 's reunification minister greeted the @entity4 at their hotel			1
the delegation met with the @entity1 's national security chief , @entity72 , and later with prime minister @entity73 - won			1
speculation on @entity5 's absence @entity5 has been conspicuously absent even from important state events , and @entity11 officials have said @entity5 is " suffering from discomfort			1
" the last times he was seen publicly , he had gained weight and developed a limp			0
he missed the @entity82 's @entity81			2
a prominent seat remained empty onstage , surrounded by @entity4 's top brass			0
a count of @entity4 announcements about @entity5 's public appearances went from 24 events in july to 16 in august -- then to just one event in september			1
his last listed public appearance was a september 4 concert			0
his absence has triggered conflicting speculation among longtime @entity4 watchers about the security of his position , and on the mechanisms of power in what is arguably the world 's most closed society			0
@entity102 , who was a prominent propagandist for @entity27 , @entity5 's father and predecessor , said the 31 - year - old dictator is a merely the " puppet " of a shadowy oligarchy			1
the old guard who make up the @entity108 and @entity109 ( @entity110 ) are the real " power holders , " @entity102 told @entity2 's @entity112 via telephone from @entity1 on friday			1
they were tied closely to the @entity5 and are not beholden to his son , he said			2
@entity102 , who defected to @entity1 almost a decade ago , told @entity112 that he has spoken with highly placed sources within the regime in recent days			2
the @entity110 , he said , " are calling the shots , and not the words of one man they do not know			0
basically , they 're no longer loyal to the ruling king 's word			2
" neither @entity2 nor @entity124 intelligence officials can confirm whether @entity102 's claims are credible , but @entity126 -- who has studied @entity4 for two decades for @entity127 , a nonprofit agency that provides research and analysis to @entity124 government agencies -- agreed that the @entity110 has enormous clout			2
" it keeps the files on everyone ( in the regime 's leadership ) , and that definitely makes it a very powerful and dangerous organization , " @entity126 said			0
@entity140 , who specializes in @entity142 issues for the @entity143 , downplayed the likelihood of a power struggle in @entity11 , telling @entity2 that high - level maneuvering to influence @entity5 is much more likely than any effort to strip him of power			1
" this is a top - down system			0
there is no number two , " @entity140 said			0
" it is a royal system , a dynastic system predicated on there being a @entity5 and then , dare i say , a ' next of @entity5 ' able to wield authoritative power from the top on an unquestioned basis			2
" @entity19 , the @entity20 analyst , doubts @entity5 is in political hot water			2
" people get sick , " he said			0
" i would n't make much of it			0
" he said he believes @entity5 is still in charge and is behind saturday 's remarkable visit			1
" @entity4 diplomacy has been engaged in concerted , well - arranged , well - managed efforts to improve relations with pretty much the entire outside world			0
and you would not expect it to happen with nobody in control , " he said			0
@entity19 's take on the reason for @entity4 's friendlier approach : economics			0
" they want @entity1 money and they want normal trade , which is subsidized by @entity1			2
" in particular , they 'd like the @entity1 to lift the so - called may 24 @entity180 , a heavy trade sanction taken in 2010 after the @entity46 sank a @entity1 ship , killing 46 sailors			1
toning down the rhetoric in stark contrast to the bellicose gesturing that has haunted relations in the past , @entity4 and @entity1 took conciliatory steps in each other 's direction in february 's first round of high - level talks			1
@entity4 took the initiative in proposing the talks as a measure to build trust			0
at the meeting , both sides agreed to tone down the harshness of their rhetoric			0
@entity11 has been particularly irked by joint military exercises between @entity1 and the @entity124 , and would like them to cease			1
the @entity4 views them as a prelude to an invasion			0
routine military exercises followed later in the same month the first round of talks was held , but were met with less vitriol and military bluster from the @entity4 than in the previous year			0
during joint @entity124 - @entity1 military maneuvers in 2013 , @entity5 flung aggressive threats at both countries and set his military in motion			1
following february 's talks , @entity1 's @entity9 proposed a second round in august			1
the @entity4 side had not responded to the proposal until saturday			0
@entity2 's @entity219 reported from @entity0 , @entity220 reported and wrote from @entity221			0
@entity2 's @entity112 , @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 contributed to this report .			0
