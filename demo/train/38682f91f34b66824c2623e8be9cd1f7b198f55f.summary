-- @entity3 's center - right @entity1 , led by prime minister @entity4 , won saturday 's general election with 48 % of the vote , according to a complete preliminary count			1
it was followed by the @entity9 , which took 25 % of the vote , the @entity11 with 10 % , and the @entity12 with 9 % , the @entity8 said			1
the @entity1 won 61 of 121 seats in the @entity3 parliament , but in his acceptance speech @entity4 said he would seek alliances with smaller parties			1
" i feel humbled and energized by the prospect of a third term			0
over the next few days i will talk to other political parties with the view of putting together a broader majority , " he said			1
pre-election polls had put @entity4 in the lead to win a third term			2
in polling for " preferred prime minister , " @entity4 had 43 % support , compared with 12 % for @entity9 's @entity29 -- this despite allegations on the campaign trail that the prime minister lied to the nation by covertly approving a widespread spying program while publicly denying it			1
one of the most vocal critics of @entity4 has been @entity38 tech entrepreneur @entity37 , who has been a @entity3 resident since 2010			1
while he could not run for office , the @entity40 founder has gradually emerged as a player on the fringe of @entity3 politics , as he fights a legal battle in @entity3 courts to avoid extradition to the @entity48 on criminal copyright charges			0
earlier this year , @entity37 founded a political party , the @entity50 , which teamed up with the @entity52 nationalist @entity51 to contest the 2014 election			0
they campaigned for a more inclusive society , greater digital rights and an end to government electronic surveillance			0
the coalition failed to win any seats in the election , prompting @entity37 to tell the @entity62 that " the brand @entity37 was poisoned ... and i did not see that before the last couple of weeks			0
" earlier this month , @entity37 hosted a trio of @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 in an event he called " @entity72 " in which they alleged @entity4 misled the public			0
the event , however , appeared to have little effect in denting the @entity1 's path to victory			2
under @entity4 , a former foreign exchange trader , the party is credited with keeping the economy on an even keel			0
@entity4 has developed a reputation as a safe pair of hands with a friendly personal style -- although his political brand may have sustained some lasting damage during a bruising election campaign , which saw one of his top ministers resign over alleged involvement in a political smear against a senior bureaucrat			2
the @entity1 won the last election in 2011 with 49.78 % of the vote			1
turnout has fallen " dramatically " in @entity3 over the last two decades , from 85 % in 1981 to 69 % at the last election in 2011 , according to the country 's electoral commission			2
@entity0 's @entity100 contributed to this report .			0
