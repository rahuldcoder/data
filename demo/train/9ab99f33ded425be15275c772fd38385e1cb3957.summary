-- could the phrase " burn a disc " soon be interred in the computing graveyard , resting peacefully alongside 8 - bit graphics and the chirping , buzzing hum of a dial - up modem ? some technology analysts , along with some of the most influential computer makers in the world , say yes			0
optical disc drives take up precious space in our ever - shrinking gadgets , and the ability to stream music or movies on demand has made cds and dvds less essential			2
the disc drive 's spin into obscurity may have started swirling faster last week			1
@entity25 's new @entity24 , its flagship desktop computer , was released friday			1
for the first time , it has no disc drive			0
this marks a trend that has already begun on some laptops , like @entity25 's @entity32 , and of course with mobile devices like smartphones and tablets			1
" over time , an optical disc will be as much of an historical curiosity as a floppy disk , " said @entity37 , a tech - industry analyst with research firm @entity39 according to @entity25 , where sleeker , thinner designs are always en vogue , dumping the disc drive was a no - brainer			1
" these old technologies are holding us back , " @entity47 , @entity25 's head of marketing , told @entity0 sister publication time			1
" they 're anchors on where we want to go			0
we find the things that have outlived their useful purpose -- our competitors are afraid to remove them			0
we try to find better solutions -- our customers have given us a lot of trust			0
" if the company 's track record on such things holds , the optical drive may be doomed			1
the original @entity67 dumped the 5 - inch disk for a 3.5 - inch floppy , and the first @entity24 was one of the first desktops without a floppy disk drive			1
" it 's clearly a long - term trend , but @entity25 's always been aggressive about making moves like this sooner as opposed to later , " @entity37 said			1
the company 's tiny @entity78 , for the record , has been disc drive - free since last year			2
@entity81 has already announced that it will stop making optical drives itself			2
and the release of @entity86 's @entity85 , an operating system that works on disc - free smartphones and tablets as well as laptops and pcs , suggests that computing giant would be well positioned for such a move as well			0
for some users , web habits have already begun trending away from actions that require external media			0
cds ? there 's music streaming or digital downloads			2
dvds ? @entity103 , @entity104 or a host of other online movie sites			0
video games ? there 's digital distribution like @entity110 and , increasingly , downloads from the major console and game makers			0
" as personal cloud services become ubiquitous and broadband speeds increase , there 's very little reason for many consumers to use an optical drive on their computer going forward , " @entity37 said			1
there are always usb ports available on the occasion that an external device is needed ( @entity25 , for what it 's worth , offers an external optical disc drive for $ 79 )			1
much as @entity128 has with its @entity130 service , @entity25 has embraced cloud computing with its @entity133 offering , which lets users store documents , photos , music and movies on web - based servers			1
a move to the cloud could mean internal storage is less of a concern for users going forward			0
combined with advances in " solid state " internal storage and quicker broadband speeds that make downloads and streaming less painful , a @entity146 era could grease the skids for @entity25 and its competitors to make increasingly thin , light and inexpensive computers			1
witness the new @entity156 , laptops that run @entity128 's @entity158 system , that rely almost exclusively on the cloud and sell for around $ 250			0
to be sure , the transition may be rough on some users			0
" for those who still own dvds and want to watch them on their computers , the @entity24 is n't the ideal solution , " @entity164 's @entity163 wrote in a review of the new @entity24			2
" sure , there 's a $ 79 external superdrive that connects via usb cable , but that means shelling out extra for -- let 's face it -- a feature that still comes standard on most pcs. it also means messing with the @entity24 's minimal - looking setup			2
" but like it or not , folks who still pop in a disc may not have long to keep doing so			0
" while it may be too early to say for certain that the optical drive is absolutely dead , " wrote @entity185 , founder of blogging network @entity186 , " it is certainly showing all the early warning signs of a technology that is past its prime			2

new innovations could spell beginning of the end for dvd drives
@entity25 's new @entity24 shipped last week with no optical drive
cloud storage , streaming and faster downloads paved the way
@entity25 was first to can the 5 - inch disk and floppy disk
