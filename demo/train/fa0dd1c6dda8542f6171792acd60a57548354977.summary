@entity0 , @entity1 -- a year ago , nearly half a million protesters took to the streets across @entity1 in perhaps the largest social justice movement in the country 's history			1
it all started when 25 - year - old @entity9 pitched a tent at the end of @entity0 's prestigious @entity12 after being evicted from her apartment and failing to find another she could afford in the city 's pricey market			1
" what happened was i went to see one apartment too many , " said @entity9			2
" i was really p --- ed off , and i 've had it			0
i kind of felt like i do n't want to play by these rules anymore			1
" she was quickly joined by hundreds of others , in what became known as @entity0 's tent city			1
in september last year , close on 500,000 people took to the streets demanding changes to the social and economic systems			0
a year on , @entity9 is living in an apartment in nearby @entity30 and the movement she became a symbol for is more muted -- but a hardy core of protesters continues to demand change			1
@entity9 , whose movement became known as @entity38 after its inception on july 14 , 2011 , is still recognized and greeted on the streets , albeit as a reluctant celebrity			1
she said she was inspired by the @entity42 uprisings , and like them , started writing about her grievances through social media			2
" it came from the gut , and because it came from the gut , i think people related to it , " she said			0
" i think most of the time people do n't want to make the first move because it 's scary , because you do n't want to look like a fool			0
" also on inside the @entity56 : @entity57 , an @entity1 star singing @entity59 songs the government responded with measures it said would resolve the housing shortage and by setting up a committee to address the issues raised by the protesters			2
@entity0 mayor @entity66 , who has been in office since 1998 , was criticized by some for what they saw as a heavy - handed police response to the protests			1
@entity66 says the rise in the cost of housing was a sign of the city 's success			1
" before people did n't find it attractive to live in @entity0 , now everybody wants to live here so the price of real estate goes up			2
" he added : " we are in the middle of creating three projects for affordable housing in the city of @entity0			2
we are doing lots of things we can			0
i 'm trying to manage a very complicated situation as best as i can			0
" for many , however , the issues that sparked the @entity38 movement are still as pressing as they were a year ago			1
@entity95 , a 40 - year - old writer taking part in recent protests , said : " now we are politically matured and we understand in order to change the cost of housing and living , you must change the system			1
" @entity104 , the 23 - year - old organizer of a recent protest , said despite the lower turnout this year , passions run just as highly			0
also on inside the @entity56 : fears for bubble burst after @entity111 boom " numbers are not the issue because many people understood that these protests on the streets are not helping because the government is not listening , " he said			0
@entity9 too says she is not disheartened by the lower profile of this year 's protests , comparing it with the year after the @entity123 student protests of may 1968			1
" first of all it 's like @entity125 ( @entity125 ) from the revolution in @entity123 in ' 68			0
he says every may ' 68 has a may ' 69 , so you ca n't go back			0
" if you want to change the system , you have to create new models			0
" follow the @entity131 the @entity56 team on @entity133 : presenter @entity135 , producer @entity136 , producer @entity137 , writer @entity138 and digital producer @entity139 : @ mairicnn .			0

@entity9 , who started the @entity38 movement in @entity1 , was partly inspired by @entity144 uprisings
@entity9 was angered by @entity0 's high *property* prices : " i do n't want to play by these rules "
a year on , protests against the cost of living continue but are more muted
mayor @entity66 says high cost of housing is a sign of @entity0 's success
