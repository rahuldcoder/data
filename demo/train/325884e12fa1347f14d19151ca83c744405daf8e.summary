hero or agitator ? @entity2 of wrongdoing or threat to the state ? @entity6 has been called many things as he fights the federal government over his firing , for what he says was retaliation after he exposed cracks in the nation 's air passenger security			1
but the @entity16 administration counters the former federal air marshal 's leaks to the media were specifically prohibited by law , and could have had catastrophic consequences			1
now the @entity23 @entity22 for the first time will hear a case involving a federal whistleblower			1
at issue is whether a government employee who makes a disclosure " specifically prohibited by law " -- in this case , security information -- is still immune from employer retaliation			0
a federal appeals court had earlier decided @entity6 's disclosures deserve whistleblower protection			1
the government then asked the justices to intervene			0
oral arguments are set for next tuesday morning			0
@entity40 , a lawyer with the @entity41 who is representing @entity6 , said he is " chomping at the bit " to argue that @entity6 's leak was in the national interest , saying it may have helped prevent terrorist attacks on the @entity23			1
the @entity48 and the @entity49 declined comment , as is custom in a pending legal case			2
@entity6 , now a resident of @entity53 , @entity54 who sells residential solar systems , hopes a @entity22 ruling in his favor will eventually lead to his return to the ranks of the @entity60 , which places armed , plain - clothes officers on commercial airplanes			1
the case began in july of 2003 , when @entity6 , then based in @entity64 , tipped off an @entity66 reporter the @entity48 was suspending overnight missions just days after air marshals were briefed about a new " potential plot " to hijack @entity23 airliners			1
the agency planned the cutback -- which would have kept air marshals off most long - distance flights -- because it was then running out of money at the end of a fiscal year			1
@entity6 also said he had privately voiced his concerns to his government supervisors			2
the news caused an immediate uproar on @entity81 , with sen. @entity82 , and then - sens. @entity83 and @entity84 , among others , writing letters expressing concerns			0
the @entity48 retreated , killing the scheduling cuts before they went into effect			2
a year later , @entity6 appeared on @entity90 -- in disguise and identified only as " @entity60 ' @entity92 ' " -- to criticize the agency 's dress policy , which , he said , made it easier for terrorists to identify the undercover air marshals			1
but someone from the @entity48 recognized @entity6 's voice -- the @entity49 said he used " a disguise that proved to be inadequate " -- and the agency ordered an investigation into @entity6 for an " unauthorized media appearance			1
" during that investigation , he admitted leaking information to the media about the 2003 suspension of long - distance flights			1
the agency fired @entity6 in april of 2006 , saying his leak was an unauthorized disclosure of " @entity111 , " or @entity111			1
supporters say @entity6 brought to public light a @entity48 action that violated federal law , which mandates that the agency give priority to flights that present high security risks , specifically mentioning " nonstop , long distance flights			1
" they say the information he gave was factual and that it ultimately protected passengers by changing a flawed policy			0
@entity6 argued the information he disclosed was not @entity111 , saying the @entity48 sent the information as a text message on his cell phone , instead of as an encrypted message on his password - protected pager			1
and it was not labeled @entity111			2
the former @entity132 veteran and @entity133 agent said his firing was retaliation for his union activities			0
but the @entity137 -- an independent government agency with jurisdiction to review federal personnel actions -- said that even if the scheduling directive was not labeled @entity111 , deployment information was " within the definition of @entity111			2
" @entity6 " admittedly knew that he was not permitted to tell anyone about ( air marshal ) scheduling , yet he did so anyway , and it could have created a significant security risk , " the board said			1
the board also concluded there is " no direct evidence " the agency retaliated or discriminated against @entity6 for his union activities			2
but the @entity152 - based federal appeals court later reversed , holding @entity6 had met the threshold of being eligible for whistleblower protection			1
if he wins at the high court , @entity6 would have to go back to the board and further demonstrate that he reasonably believed that his disclosures " evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety			2
" " frankly , that 's a hearing we would relish because there 's little question that his disclosures were worthy , " said @entity40 , @entity6 's attorney			2
" numerous members of @entity167 attacked ( the travel cuts ) as betraying the department 's ( responsibilities )			0
the @entity171 said it was a mistake and canceled the orders less than 48 hours after his disclosure			0
they only corrected the mistake because of his disclosure			0
" the tricky legal issue is whether the revelations were " specifically prohibited by law , " as the statute indicates			0
the @entity49 will tell the nine justices that these kinds of leaks are covered , since " the phrase ' by law ' is presumed to include both statutes and substantive regulations that have the force and effect of law			0
" " in the course of its efforts to secure the nation 's transportation network , the @entity48 necessarily develops and acquires a great deal of information , including information about security vulnerabilities , that has the potential to cause extreme harm if publicly disclosed , " government lawyers wrote to the court			2
" the ( lower court 's ) decision in this case , however , effectively permits individual federal employees to override the @entity48 's judgments about the dangers of public disclosure			1
" but @entity6 , supported by a range of lawmakers and advocacy groups , strongly disagrees			0
six bipartisan members of @entity167 -- including sens. @entity215 , @entity216 ; and @entity217 , @entity218 , told the court they " know that whistleblowers are more likely to come forward when they can do so without fear of reprisal			0
" a ruling for the government " would open the door to agency over-reach in suppressing inconvenient information , as decades of experience confirms , " said the legislative group , which includes four congressmen			0
" just from reading the statute , it is far from clear whether the particular information @entity6 disclosed is included " in the @entity171 rules			0
@entity6 continues his personal crusade with an active website and unflinching mission			0
in testimony to @entity167 last month , the married father of three called it " a whistleblowing experience i never wanted to have			0
but it forced me to make the most difficult choices and decisions of my life , about my duty to the country as a public servant and law enforcement officer			0
" the case is @entity171 v. @entity6 ( 13 - 894 )			1
a ruling is due by the spring of 2015 .			0
