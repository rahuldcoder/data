-- a @entity2 warship sunk off the @entity4 coast more than 400 years ago will go on display in a new museum friday , along with thousands of artifacts recovered with the wreck			1
the @entity9 , which is still undergoing conservation work , is the only 16th century warship on display in the world , according to the @entity15			1
the 500 - year - old vessel was the flagship of @entity18 and sank in his view off the south coast near @entity15 on july 19 , 1545 , while leading an attack against a @entity23 invasion fleet			1
it remained there until it was raised from the seabed in 1982 to great fanfare			1
over the decades since , the wooden hull has been sprayed continuously , first with fresh water to remove salt and then with a wax solution , to prevent the timbers drying out and shrinking			0
that spray was turned off last month to allow the next phase of conservation to be carried out , the dockyard said			0
while the ship is on display , it will be dried out in a specially constructed airtight glass chamber			0
more than 100 tons of water will be extracted from the hull over the next four to five years , conservationists say			0
once that process is complete , the walls will be removed to give visitors an unimpeded view of the ship			2
the new @entity48 , built at the @entity15 dockyard at a cost of @entity51 £ 27 million ( $ 40.7 million ) , also houses many of the 19,000 artifacts raised with the ship			2
items on display include the skeleton of the ship 's dog , wooden bowls , leather shoes , musical instruments and combs complete with 500 - year - old head lice , as well as weapons such as longbows and metal cannon			1
many of the ship 's crew died when she went down			0
the raising of the ship and its preservation were landmarks in marine archeology , the dockyard says .			0
