-- at a time when most birdwatchers are counting the bird species on the way to extinction , to find a new species previously unknown to science might be cause to pop the champagne corks			1
but to find one in plain view on a construction site in urban @entity12 in @entity13 is nothing short of a sensation in ornithological circles			1
the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) is one of only two bird species found exclusively in @entity13 ( the other is the @entity21 ) and its discovery has the world 's " twitchers " -- as birdwatchers are known -- twitching with excitement			1
" the modern discovery of an undescribed bird species within the limits of a large populous city -- not to mention 30 minutes from my home -- is extraordinary , " said @entity28 of the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) , who was part of the team that investigated the new species			2
" the discovery indicates that new species of birds may still be found in familiar and unexpected locations , " he said in a statement			0
described by the @entity29 as a " wren - sized small gray bird with rufous cap and black throat , " birdwatchers have since found it in abundant numbers in floodplain scrub on the outskirts of @entity12			1
while scientists say the birds can still be found in numbers , they say its habitat is declining and have recommended that the species be classified as @entity54 under the @entity56 's ( @entity55 ) @entity55			0
the remnant floodplain scrub that exists within the @entity13 city of 1.5 million people , however , may go some way to explaining how the bird went unnoticed in the city for so long			2
the bird was discovered by a member of the @entity29 who took photographs of what was first thought to be a similar , coastal species of @entity68 at a construction site on the edge of @entity12			1
the bird in the photographs defied identification and further investigation revealed that it was an entirely unknown species			2
" @entity79 contains a spectacular concentration of bird life , but is also under sharply increasing threats ranging from large scale development projects to illegal hunting , " @entity75 , @entity76 of @entity77 said in a press release			0
" further work is needed to better understand the distribution and ecology of this exciting newly described species to determine its conservation needs			0
" according to the @entity91 publication " @entity92 " , a half century of human conflict in @entity94 -- which made the region off - limits to bird watchers -- has made @entity13 , @entity99 and @entity100 a fertile zone for twitchers , with the past two decades witnessing a flush of new bird discoveries			1
the publication said that while the modern discovery of an undescribed bird species close to sea - level within the limits of a large city in a populous country was extraordinary , it was not unprecedented , citing the discovery of new species of marsh bird close to @entity114 in @entity115 in 2005			2
it said the sheer ordinariness of the @entity68 's scrubby habitat may have kept it hidden until now			0
" this habitat is of little interest to birdwatchers and ornithologists because the other species that it supports are some of the most widespread and abundant birds in tropical @entity79 , " the publication said			0
" even if its habitat were to attract more attention , the denseness of the habitat and the species ' skulking habits would more often than not render it invisible to the casual would - be observer			0

birdwatchers discover previously unknown species of bird in @entity13
the @entity17 was photographed near a construction site in @entity12
the rare find indicates there may be more species yet to be discovered in the region
until now , 50 years of human conflict had made parts of @entity94 off - limits to bird watchers
