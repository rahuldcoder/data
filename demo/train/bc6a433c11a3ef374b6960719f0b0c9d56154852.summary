-- the @entity2 city of @entity3 exploded into chaos early thursday morning as gunmen launched a series of attacks across the country 's commercial capital , killing scores of people and taking hostages in two luxury hotels frequented by @entity14			2
@entity15 says extremists could be reacting to @entity18 's gestures toward @entity19			1
@entity0 's @entity20 spoke with author @entity15 about the situation			1
@entity20 : let 's go to dr. @entity15 , the physician , philosopher			1
his new book is " @entity24 : a story of @entity26			2
" where were you born in @entity2 , @entity15 ? @entity15 : i was born in @entity30 , but i have been in these hotels many , many times			1
i have stayed there , so i know the scene ; i know the restaurants			2
i have been trying to get in touch with my friends and relatives , some of whom i have spoken to , some of whom i ca n't speak to			2
we 're texting each other			2
a friend of mine from @entity45 was in the restaurant at the @entity48 hotel when the firing started , and somehow she managed to avoid the fray , hid in a basement and is now holed up in a room which is right next to the @entity48 hotel and is waiting to be told what to do			2
the situation is complex , @entity20 , because it could inflame to proportions that we can not even imagine			2
it has to be contained			0
we now recognize that this is a global problem , with only a global effort can solve this			1
and you know , one of the things that i think is happening is that these militant terrorist groups are actually terrified that [ president - elect @entity18 ] @entity18 's gestures to the rest of the @entity19 world may actually overturn the tables on them by alienating them from the rest of the @entity19 world , so they 're reacting to this			1
you know , this is @entity18 's opportunity to actually harness the help of the @entity19			1
you know , there 's 1.8 billion muslims in the world			0
that 's 25 percent of the population of the world			0
it 's the fastest - growing religion in the world			0
we can not , if we do not appease and actually recruit the help of this @entity19 world , we 're going to have a problem on our hands			1
and we can not go after the wrong people , as we did after 9/11 , because then the whole collateral damage that occurs actually aggravates the situation			1
in @entity2 , this is particularly inflammatory , because there 's a rise of @entity93 fundamentalism			0
we saw what that did in @entity96 , where , you know , @entity19 were scorched and they were killed , and there was almost a genocide of the @entity19			1
@entity2 has 150 million @entity19			1
that 's more muslims in @entity2 than in @entity102			0
so this is an opportunity right now for @entity2 and @entity102 to recognize this is their common problem			2
it 's not a @entity19 problem right now ; it 's a global problem			1
... @entity20 : do you think that this is just the beginning , that there 's a potential impact , or more ? @entity15 : there is a potential impact of a lot more carnage			1
but it can be contained			0
and right now , one of the questions , you know , after i heard @entity122 talking about how coordinated this is , that there are militant groups that cross international boundaries , is who is financing this ? where is the money coming from ? we have to ask very serious , honest questions			0
what role do we have in this ? are our petrodollars funding both sides of this war on terrorism ? why are we not asking the @entity137 where that money is going that we give them ? is it going through this supply chain to @entity102 ? it 's not enough for @entity102 to condemn it			0
@entity102 should cooperate with @entity2 in uprooting this			0
they should be part of the surgery that is going to happen			0
it 's not enough for @entity2 to blame @entity102			0
@entity2 should actually ask the @entity102 to help them			0
and it 's not enough for us to worry about westerners being killed and @entity152 being killed			0
every life is precious over there			0
we have got to get rid of this idea that this is an @entity152 problem or a @entity14 problem			2
it 's a global problem , and we need a global solution , and we need the help of all the @entity19 , 25 percent of the world 's population , to help us uproot this problem			1
@entity20 : what does @entity2 immediately do ? @entity15 : @entity2 at this moment has to contain any reactive violence from the @entity166 , which is very likely and possible			1
so @entity2 has to condemn that by not blaming local @entity19			1
they have to identify the exact groups			0
and the world has to be very careful that they do n't go after the wrong people			1
because if you go after the wrong people , you convert moderates into extremists			1
it happens every time , and retribution against innocent people just because they have the same religion actually aggravates and perpetuates the problem			1
@entity20 : are you pessimistic ? @entity15 : i think mr. @entity18 has a real opportunity here , but a challenging opportunity , a creative opportunity			1
get rid of the phrase " war on terrorism			0
" ask for a creative solution in which we all participate			0
@entity20 : is it because the war on terrorism really can never be won because the terrorists ( inaudible ) ? @entity15 : because it 's an oxymoron			1
it 's an oxymoron , @entity20 , a war on war , a war on terrorism			0
you know , terrorists call mechanized death from 35,000 feet above sea level with a press of a button also terror			0
we do n't call it that , because our soldiers are wearing uniforms			0
they do n't see what is happening , and innocent people are being killed			2
so , you know , terror is a term that you apply to the other			0
@entity20 : thanks , @entity15 , as always , extraordinarily enlightening .			2
