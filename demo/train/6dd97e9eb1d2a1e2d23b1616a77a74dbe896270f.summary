-- new champions , multiple first - time finalists , big names battling to regain glories -- this has been arguably the most unpredictable tennis season in over 15 years			1
and there could be more surprises to come			0
the four grand slams are done and dusted , but places at the year - end championships are still up for grabs for both the men and women			1
but before we move on to the final leg of the season , it 's time to look back at the sport 's biggest tournaments and draw some conclusions			1
here are five of them			0
@entity23 is becoming a clay - court specialist let 's clarify that			2
@entity28 is still able to go deep at hard - court events , but of the @entity31 's 10 titles since the end of 2010 , only two -- @entity33 last year and @entity34 in 2011 -- have come on surfaces other than clay			1
at the grand slams , @entity28 has won the @entity38 twice and been a runner - up in her three most recent visits to @entity41 , while reaching the semis in 2011 , but the last time she appeared in a final at the other three majors was at the @entity46			1
this year 's trip to @entity38 bailed @entity28 out -- the 27 - year - old did n't get to the quarterfinals in @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
perhaps in the years ahead , @entity28 might tweak her clay - court schedule to make it less taxing			1
her prospects at @entity56 next year should be better with an extra week between the @entity38 and the grass - court event			0
the men 's ' @entity58 ' are more vulnerable when @entity61 defeated @entity62 at the @entity63 in early september , it meant that for the first time in a season since 2003 , two players not named @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 or @entity68 won a men 's grand slam singles title			1
@entity74 , you 'll recall , opened the season by claiming the @entity76			0
it was also the first time since the @entity78 that none of the " @entity58 " showed up in a grand slam final			1
but is this the end of grand slam dominance by the acclaimed quartet -- who have bagged a combined 40 majors ? maybe not			1
while @entity74 has always owned the game to overpower opponents , his victory over @entity66 in january 's @entity76 final had much to do with the @entity91 's back injury			2
remember that @entity66 possessed a 12 - 0 record against @entity74 , without dropping a set , entering the finale			2
if @entity66 had won the title in @entity50 , @entity61 's triumph in @entity52 would be regarded as a blip instead of potentially the lessening of the established stars ' grip			1
if we 're looking for the main reason why the @entity58 's rivals gained ground this year , injuries to @entity66 -- who did n't play at @entity107 due to a wrist problem -- and @entity68 physically struggling to recover from back surgery in 2013 , should be right up there			1
even @entity61 admitted the chasing pack got " lucky			2
" " i think the guys from the second line were a bit lucky because @entity68 was also having trouble with his back ; @entity74 was up and down with his tennis after @entity119 , " he told reporters in @entity52			0
" a few other players were not playing the best all the time			2
" and @entity66 is not here			2
so that opened a little bit the gate for everybody else			0
" now , if two players outside the @entity58 win majors in 2015 ... @entity65 is back as a grand slam contender speaking of injuries ... @entity65 's back problems contributed to a poor summer in 2013 , which included a second - round exit at @entity56 and fourth - round loss at the @entity63			1
but the @entity135 ' health recovery and larger racket led to a return to the later rounds at grand slams in 2014			1
he reached at least the semifinals in three majors -- with @entity143 accounting for @entity65 in the fourth round at @entity38 -- and was a set away from winning his 18th major at @entity56			2
@entity148 began the year strong , so the outspoken @entity150 's win was hardly as surprising as those of @entity152 and @entity153 against @entity65 in @entity51 and @entity52 last year			0
@entity65 's increased forays to the net shorten points and thus figure to add to his longevity , but his net points won in his four losses at grand slams this year -- 59.9 % -- shows you how difficult it is to enjoy success with such tactics against the best opposition			1
although @entity65 did n't win a grand slam in 2014 , a big title could be on the way			0
@entity135 is favored to win the @entity168 after reaching the final last weekend , and if that happens , the only thing missing from @entity65 's overflowing trophy cabinet will be an @entity172 singles gold			0
@entity38 warmup tournaments did n't mean much for @entity66 if buildup tournaments were anything to go by , @entity66 was n't supposed to win the @entity38			0
by his standards , the man who is regularly called the @entity66 slumped in @entity179 and @entity180 , and lost to @entity67 in the @entity182 final			0
his lone title during the @entity185 clay - court swing came in @entity186 , and even then his camp said he was fortunate because @entity62 was injured			0
the @entity189 player bossed proceedings until , feeling the effects of a back injury , he was forced to retire at 3 - 0 in the third set			0
but once @entity66 entered the grounds at @entity38 , that was all irrelevant			0
he progressed to the final in 712 minutes -- his quickest route to the final in nine visits -- and rallied to overcome @entity67 to preserve his unblemished record in those finals			0
as for @entity67 , he -- not for the first time -- wilted in the heat			0
having won his second @entity56 title in july , and then got married , he stumbled in stifling conditions at the @entity63			2
as his coach @entity207 put it , " the sun hit @entity67 first " in his semifinal loss to @entity62			0
there was plenty of variety how rare was it to have eight different singles winners at the grand slams ? very			1
only twice since the @entity217 began in 1968 had it previously happened : 1990 ( @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 ; @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 ) and 1998 ( @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 ; @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity225 , @entity232 )			0
the way @entity234 cruised in @entity52 for her 18th major , she has to be the favorite to pick up multiple grand slams in 2015			1
however , @entity234 wo n't be a shoe - in given how the @entity76 , @entity38 and @entity56 unfolded this year			0
the top - ranked @entity239 failed to reach the quarterfinals in all of the other majors -- an almost unthinkable situation given her dominance at the end of last season			2
it opened the way for three first - time women 's finalists -- @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 -- while @entity254 played a grand slam title match for the first time since 2009			1
@entity234 and @entity67 won the respective season - ending championships in 2014 , but who will triumph at the @entity259 in @entity260 next month and the @entity262 's @entity51 showpiece in november very much remains to be seen .			2

@entity265 ' grand slams came to an end this year when @entity61 won the @entity63
first time in a season since 2003 two players outside men 's " @entity58 " won a major
but injuries may have played a part , especially for @entity274 's @entity66
@entity28 prospered on the clay in @entity41 but struggled elsewhere at majors
