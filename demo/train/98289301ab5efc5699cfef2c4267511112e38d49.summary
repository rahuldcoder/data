@entity0 was only 20 years old when he was shot and killed on april 13			2
of the nearly two dozen people reported killed that day , about half were under age 30			1
sadly , this tally is not rare			2
according to the @entity9 , guns kill twice as many kids as cancer while @entity12 remains stalemated			1
a bill to pass gun reforms failed in the @entity15 on wednesday			1
as @entity18 has reported , 13 young people between ages 10 and 24 are the victims of homicide every single day			1
firearms account for 80 % of those deaths			2
the toll gun violence is taking on young people was the inspiration for @entity25 , a collaboration between the @entity27 and my organization , @entity30			1
more than 70 artists have submitted 111 poster designs against gun violence			1
most of these artists are in their 20s			2
you do not have to agree with the message of each individual poster			2
collectively , they represent the diverse voices of a generation desperate to stop the violence devastating its members			1
in poll after poll , large numbers of @entity46 age 18 - 30 support gun reform measures			1
it is worth listening to what the young people who submitted these posters are trying to say			1
@entity53 , a 23 - year - old from @entity54 , @entity55 , submitted " @entity56			2
" she says people are desensitized to the violence			1
" it is simply how it is , how it has always been			2
this is what guns are like			1
" she grew up outside @entity66 and recalls one of her older sisters coming home from school in the city with terrifying news : " my classmate got shot and they 're dead			0
" it left a lasting impression on her			0
@entity77 , 25 , was around guns while growing up in rural @entity79			1
they were not something bad or dangerous , simply a part of life			0
but a personal experience last spring led to his piece , " @entity89			0
" @entity77 and his wife were considering going to watch the @entity94 @entity93 playoffs game in @entity95 , but decided against it at the last minute			0
that night , gunfire broke out near the arena			0
" i always heard about shootings in cities but never felt a connection because i live in the country , " @entity77 says			0
" that made it real			0
we could have been there			0
i have friends who were there			0
they have video of it on their phones			0
" @entity113 , from @entity114 , sent in a piece called " dissolve the targets			0
" though he supports restrictions on guns , he has a big problem with violence in the media , especially the video game industry			1
young people , he says , " need to see that violence in general is absolutely horrific			1
they need to see humans as humans , not something you can kill and get 100 points			1
" @entity130 lives in @entity131 , but grew up in war - torn @entity132			0
she recalls seeing people threatened and killed			2
her aunt and uncle met while taking cover under a table at a restaurant during a gunfight			0
her poster , " @entity141 , more kindness , " aims to confront the culture of fear she saw in @entity132 and sees today in cities around @entity46			1
can their posters make a dent in a debate dominated by the @entity152 's army of lobbyists ? they think so			1
" we live in a culture of short attention spans and high consumption , " @entity130 says			0
" as artists we create striking images that even if you see for only two or three seconds can change minds			2
" @entity163 co-founded the @entity27 with longtime friend @entity164			0
after @entity165 , artists started asking what they could do to help			0
" older generations accept that this is how the game is played , the need to wait for @entity12 , that leaders ca n't go too far , " @entity163 says			0
" but younger people have seen failure after failure -- on the financial crisis , the environment and guns			1
we 're too fired up to wait or sign petitions that we just have n't seen working			0
" @entity164 , the creator of @entity179 for @entity180 , believes that art and culture can simulate the kind of personal experience that gets people involved			2
" seeing one of these posters forces you to take a stance , " he notes			2
" you ca n't help but decide if you agree , or if you see it differently			0
and now you are more involved			0
" or , as @entity193 puts it , artists can pose a simple question : " what if it was n't like this ? " @entity77 recalls a story in an @entity79 paper about a known felon buying a firearm at a gun show while the local police stood by , helpless			1
" if you 're smart with guns and people are around guns they are n't necessarily bad			1
but seeing this story you realize something has to change for our safety as @entity46			1
" idealistic , yet practical			0
always experimenting with new ideas			0
determined to change the world			1
i can not wait for the best of this next generation to take over .			2
