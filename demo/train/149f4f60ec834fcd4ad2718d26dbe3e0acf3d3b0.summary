-- @entity1 , hammers and laying out - it 's the " ultimate " flying saucer attack			1
and if @entity7 is right , his sport could soon be coming to an @entity8 near you			1
@entity7 is one of an estimated five million people who are taking to green spaces across the @entity12 to play a game that is particularly booming at college level			1
but forget outdated notions of dogs scurrying after flying discs in the park , ultimate is a frenetic pursuit that blends aspects of football and rugby into a dynamic " frisbee " package			1
and @entity7 firmly believes a movement that began with the idle toss of a cake pan lid on a @entity30 beach some 76 years ago is destined for a slot at the greatest sporting show on earth			1
" i think that ultimate will become an @entity8 sport , " @entity7 , who plays for @entity36 - based team @entity34 , told @entity0 's human to @entity38			1
" the sport has got better on the whole			2
there are more players that are picking it up in high school and in middle school , and the level of talent is continuing to get younger			0
" so we have young kids who are coming out and being stars at the highest level because they 're starting so early			0
" there 's a bunch of amateurs already doing it , and i think it 's an international sport , so we can easily play against other teams and we 're already doing it -- it 's just being part of the @entity8			1
" according to the @entity61 website , membership of college clubs has doubled in the past 10 years , while participation internationally is also growing			1
more than 42 countries play the game , with teams from @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 also thriving			1
but how do you play it ? @entity61 is contested between two teams , each consisting of seven players			1
the aim is to pass your way into the opposition 's end zone , just like in @entity79 , but once in possession players are n't allowed to run with the disc			1
the concept was born in @entity83 back in the late 1930s when a teenage @entity84 and his girlfriend started throwing a popcorn lid back and forth on the beach			0
through various incarnations this led to @entity84 manufacturing his own plastic discs , which were then bought in the 1950s and patented as " @entity91 " by the @entity91 company			0
millions were sold worldwide and by the 1970s the origins of @entity61 had been born			2
@entity7 and his @entity34 gang are chief exponents of the sport , winning the @entity61 national championships in 2009			1
the 29 - year - old was also selected in the @entity12 ultimate beach team back in 2011 , his proudest achievement in the game to date			1
players are constantly harrying round the field of play creating space , executing a variety of throws -- including the " hammer " and the " scoober " -- and flinging themselves around attempting to catch the disc			2
@entity7 says any budding players must be equipped with the three pillars of ultimate : to run hard , jump high and throw far			1
but while the game moves at a fast pace , respect is a key component , because ultimate is ultimately self - policed			2
" competition is great , but you want to have good spirit , " @entity7 explained			2
" i am a proponent of it			0
i think it 's great			0
" we do n't have any referees in the game , and so people have to make calls against each other and they have to be respectful			2
we do have observers , though , and they 've been very helpful i think			0
" they help speed up the game , they keep the clock between points , they keep discussions between two players to a minimum			2
they let you discuss what you saw , what the other player saw , but then they 'll try to come to an agreement or a decision quicker than if they were n't there			0
" i think there are still bad calls made -- sometimes observers miss calls just like referees , and they 're human			0
i mean , we 're all human , we 're going to make the wrong call sometimes , but i think on the whole they have a very positive effect on the game			2
" if the sport can be classified as quirky , so can some of the names of the teams who compete in the @entity164 tour alongside @entity7 's @entity165			1
@entity166 , @entity167 ( @entity167 ) , @entity168 and revolver are just some of the clubs involved			0
@entity7 has friends from various teams and says that even though they are spread far and wide , the overriding theme of the league is community			1
" i love ultimate because of the players , the people that are involved with it -- they 're just very inviting , very welcoming , " he said			0
" i think that 's the best part of ultimate			0
" it 's a situation where you can play competitively and then go out for a drink , go out for food afterwards , even though you 're playing against those players you can still be friends off the field			0
" it might only be a small disc weighing just 175 grams but there are many ways to manipulate it around the playing field			0
as @entity7 explains , the two most common throws are backhand and forehand , just like in tennis , and the best players complete pinpoint passes with a simple flick of the wrist			2
the more complicated maneuvers include the hammer , an overhead throw that travels far faster than either the forehand or backhand , used to quickly switch play from one side of the field to the other			0
then there 's the scoober , a short flick used to loop the disc over a defender , typically no more than 15 or 20 yards			0
but despite the variations of throw , @entity7 's favorite aspect of the game is attempting to catch			1
" my favorite thing to do is lay out , " he said			0
" i dive for the disc , leave my feet and catch the disc as it 's going to the ground			0
" it means that i ca n't run it out , i need to extend as far as possible to catch the disc			0
the disc is the most important thing in ultimate			2
" you have to maintain possession , so laying out if you have to do it , you 've got to do it			0
" @entity61 now has two pro leagues in the @entity12 and interest is growing , but for now the @entity229 and their players are doing it purely for the love of the game			1
as @entity7 says with a smile : " i make zero dollars playing ultimate , but i spend way more than that			1

' @entity61 ' is a *largely* recreational sport that is growing in *popularity*
@entity7 is one of the leading proponents of the amateur side of the game
@entity12 believes that ultimate should become an @entity8 sport in *future*
it involves two teams trying to pass a flying disc towards an end zone
