@entity0 -- the first time @entity4 shot up heroin , he was too scared to do it himself			1
so his friend did it for him -- when he was 16			2
" i would shoot up mostly in my feet , " he said			2
" it escalated to almost five or six bags every time i shot up			1
" he spent hundreds of dollars a day feeding his addiction			1
" i was stealing money from my parents , i was doing illegal actions with my friends , i broke into houses , i 've done all of the above besides selling myself			0
" @entity4 , now 17 , is in treatment at @entity20 , a long - term substance abuse program on @entity22 , @entity0 , for youths ages 12 to 17			1
his road to recovery has n't been a smooth ride , however			0
after three failed attempts at outpatient treatment , @entity4 entered an in - patient program at @entity20 , but he ran away five times in the first few months			1
that is not uncommon , said @entity32 , vice president of adolescent services at @entity20			0
" it really requires an extended amount of time , " he said			0
4 arrested , 350 bags of suspected heroin seized in @entity39 case for @entity4 and the others at @entity20 , treatment means removing any distractions to recovery			1
there are no cell phones , personal televisions or computers allowed , except for doing homework			0
teens in the program have mandatory jobs , like service crew , and can work their way up to leadership positions among their peers			0
there 's a primary focus on youths taking responsibility for their own behavior			1
@entity4 ' parents said that in short - term treatment programs , he made new connections with other users that caused him to relapse when he got out			1
" we 're able to have them here for a longer window , where we 're really able to shift the values , " @entity32 said			0
" we do very intense work with the families			0
so we help shift the family 's support system			1
" from heroin addict to @entity75 mom heroin use has exploded in what is being described as an epidemic on @entity0 's @entity22 , where addiction counselors are seeing users as young as 12 -- many from middle - class , suburban families			1
several factors have contributed to this " perfect storm " of addiction according to experts -- among them , proximity to major airports and transportation centers , and a statewide crackdown on prescription painkillers , that has had the unintended effect of pushing more kids to cheaper and more accessible heroin			1
the trend appears to be national			0
the @entity98 says @entity100 drug poisoning deaths involving heroin went up 45 % from 2006 to 2010			1
and the @entity102 says the amount of heroin seized each year at the southwest @entity100 border increased 232 % from 2008 to 2012			1
and the trend is bad for younger users			0
among four age groups , " drug poisoning deaths involving heroin " increased only for the youngest group , ages 15 to 24 , from 2008 to 2010			1
for all the other age groups , the number of deaths was steady or went down , the @entity98 says			1
in @entity22 , it 's gotten so bad that one official dubbed the @entity117 , which runs east across the island from @entity0 , the " @entity119			1
" @entity120 , executive director of the @entity121 on @entity122 , said the death of actor @entity39 puts a national spotlight on drug abuse			1
but he fears the attention wo n't last			0
are heroin death probes created equal ? " what will happen , and what we 're seeing now , is some attention on the overdose , attention on treatment and recovery			1
and then , in a few days , we 'll go back to life as it was , " he said			1
@entity39 " was one of an estimated 100 people yesterday who lost their lives through a fatal overdose , " @entity120 said monday			0
" we probably could have prevented most of those overdoses , through prevention , access to treatment , recovery support			0
so each one is an indictment of what we failed to do			0
but it also should energize us to say we need to get serious about this disease			0
" and @entity120 sees another disturbing trend : " ten years ago , if you used two to three bags of heroin a day , you were considered a chronic heavy user			1
for kids these days , that 's breakfast			1
" how heroin kills you a deadly one			2
heroin has killed a record number of people on @entity22 in the last two years , data shows			1
heroin arrests on @entity22 by the @entity102 are up 163 % in just the last year			1
@entity120 says he 's seen a seven-fold increase in patients in the past five years -- 80 % of them from heroin and other opiates			1
users often do n't fit the stereotype of the heroin addict			2
many are cheerleaders , athletes and straight - a students from loving homes			2
" you could n't have looked at my daughter and said she was a heroin addict , " said @entity176 , whose daughter , @entity177 , died of an overdose at 22			2
" the girl was beautiful			0
she was blond like the rest of these kids -- absolutely beautiful and you did n't know it			2
( @entity186 ) was all over			0
" @entity187 : my state in addiction stranglehold parents are caught between denial and shame over the stigma of having a heroin - addicted child			1
@entity4 ' mother , @entity197 , said she was shocked to learn her son was using the drug			2
" heroin ? my son ? never			2
how did i not see that ? " @entity202 , who lost her son @entity203 at age 28 , says stigma is keeping families from seeking help			0
" our children are just like every other mother or father 's child and they 're not junkies			2
and that term needs to change			0
" getting an addicted child into treatment is difficult , and insurance wo n't always pay			0
@entity176 said short - term programs also did not help her daughter			2
" there have to be long - term recovery programs , " she said			2
" well over a year			0
i think it 's very difficult for these kids to come back			1
" @entity224 , whose 24 - year - old daughter , @entity225 , died of an overdose in her own bed , said in short - term rehab , " @entity229			2
they all know how to conceal , contrive , steal , get more money to support the habit			0
" @entity4 says he believes his 11 months at @entity20 saved his life			0
" i put myself in so many circumstances where i could have died , " he says			0
" being able to say that i have different ways that i can manage my emotions besides getting high , it makes me very happy and excited to go through my future			0
" he 'll begin that future next week , when he graduates from @entity20 , moves back home with his parents and faces the challenge of staying sober			0
his mother , @entity197 , says the program not only saved her son , " it saved us , too			0
