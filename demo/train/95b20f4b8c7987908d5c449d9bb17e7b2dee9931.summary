-- no one can accuse @entity2 of stinting in its efforts to reach for the sky			1
less than a year after construction was halted on a world - beating 838 - meter tower in @entity9 in central @entity2 ( just days after it began ) architects have revealed plans to build something even bigger			1
at one kilometer ( 0.6 miles ) high , the largest of the two @entity14 planned for @entity15 , the capital of @entity17 province in central @entity2 , will be the tallest in the world if completed on schedule in 2017/2018			1
the towers will also be crazily futuristic and super environmentally friendly			0
and pink " yes , [ they are pink ] , " @entity22 of @entity24 - based design firm @entity23 tells @entity0			0
" they reflect the spectacular colors of the sunsets in the region			0
" designed to sit on an island in a lake , the largest of the towers will stand 172 meters ( 564 feet ) taller than @entity34 in @entity35			1
the project is still awaiting government final approval , but if all goes to plan it could steal a march on the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41 , which is also designed to top out at one kilometer , but not until 2019			0
with a 2012 population of 9.7 million , @entity15 is located on the @entity43			2
it 's a major transportation hub that 's been called " the @entity45 of @entity2			1
" biggest kaleidoscope and floating restaurants " [ we were asked ] to create an iconic building for @entity15 , which embodied a strong environmental and social content as well as reflecting @entity2 tradition , " says @entity22			1
the design is inspired by dualism in @entity2 culture -- the traditional @entity2 phoenix symbol of the two birds , " @entity61 " and " @entity62 , " as well as the idea of yin and yang			2
@entity63 , or phoenix , are a pair of mythical birds in @entity2 culture traditionally used to denote royalty			2
three large spheres containing celestial - themed restaurants accessible via " skywalks " will be suspended between the two towers			2
the spheres " represent planets orbiting the @entity14 , " according to the designers			0
if giant pink towers and celestial spheres are n't gaudy enough , the larger building will have the unlikely boast of housing the world 's tallest kaleidoscope driven by a wind turbine			1
it 'll project a psychedelic display for people gazing up from below			0
a ground - level commercial center looks set to continue @entity2 's current obsession with imitating global architectural styles			1
" you 'll have a @entity90 street , a @entity91 street , a @entity92 street and so forth ... to allow people to see the world without necessarily having to leave @entity2 , " @entity22 told the @entity87			1
sci - fi environmental features the towers are designed to have green features such as pollution - absorbing surfaces to filter the city 's air as well as technology to aerate and filter the water			1
thermal chimneys , suspended air gardens and biomass boilers for waste recycling are also part of the plan			0
the towers are designed to be able to generate enough power to fulfill their own needs and those of neighboring areas			0
" the @entity61 tower uses cutting - edge technology to ' feed ' the @entity62 tower with renewable power in a symbiotic process , " the design firm said in a statement			0
the two towers will cover seven hectares of a 47 - hectare site on the island			2
" it is wonderful to work in @entity2 -- the response to new ideas is always enthusiastic and optimistic , " says @entity22			0
" the chance to develop a unique site -- a large lake in a large city -- provides a wonderful opportunity to create something very special for @entity2			0

@entity2 to build the world 's tallest towers , called the @entity138 , in @entity15 in central @entity2
the buildings will reach one kilometer into the sky , 172 meters higher than @entity34 in @entity35
both will feature high - tech environment features as well as the world 's biggest kaleidoscope
