-- " take our country back			1
" almost as soon as @entity3 became president four years ago , we began hearing that phrase , as if black folks had stolen the @entity7			1
each time i see one of those " @entity14 " signs on someone 's lawn , i want to knock on the door and ask , " from whom ? " from whom are you trying to take this country back ? but i do n't , because i already know the answer			1
it 's the same answer to the question of why so many people still do n't believe that president @entity3 was born in the @entity24			1
or why they continue to question his faith or why @entity28 feels comfortable insulting the office by promising his pocket change in exchange for @entity3 's college transcripts , as if the president is a stripper desperate for singles			1
he and his kind are so pathetic			0
they do n't just disagree with him			1
they disrespect him , because in their minds , he 's not supposed to be there			2
he 's not a real @entity24			0
something about him ai n't ... quite ... right			0
opinion : @entity3 's victory wo n't transform @entity24 so when he was awarded the @entity45 , his critics spent more time discrediting the importance of the award than congratulating him for winning it			1
when unemployment fell under 8 % , they accused the @entity3 administration of fixing the numbers			1
when the president opted to campaign instead of surveying the damage caused by @entity55 sooner , he was called selfish			0
when @entity3 left the campaign trail to survey the damage caused by @entity58 , former @entity60 director @entity59 criticized him for responding too quickly			1
nothing he did was good enough for them			0
but on tuesday , it was good enough for the majority of real @entity24			1
we watched then - congressman @entity66 call the stimulus package a failure and then show up for a groundbreaking ceremony for a manufacturing plant made possible by the stimulus			0
we saw @entity73 gov. @entity72 call the stimulus a waste during debates while quietly using stimulus money to balance his state 's budget			0
rep. @entity80 , the supposed numbers man of the @entity81 , repeatedly called the stimulus a wasteful spending spree , and then we found out he wrote letters asking for stimulus money in his district ( @entity87 ) , because according to him , it would " stimulate the local and area economy by creating new jobs			0
" it was hard for real @entity24 to take criticism of the @entity94 seriously when those doing the criticizing were busy talking out of both sides of their anti-obama mouths			0
and that 's exactly what we 've watched for much of four years : the president 's critics being more focused on making him look like a failure than on helping the country succeed			2
either way , despite the disrespect and the disregard and the attempts to suppress votes or intimidate voters , despite the misguided cry of " take our country back , " @entity3 was re-elected because the majority of the @entity24 people saw the truth			1
you remember when @entity80 stood up in front of nation during the @entity127 and blamed the president for a plant closing in @entity130 , @entity131 ? yeah , turns out the closure was planned before @entity3 even took office			2
the people in @entity130 knew the truth , which is probably why more than 60 % of the county it 's in voted for @entity3			2
opinion : five things @entity3 must do there is no need to take this country back , because it has n't gone anywhere ... except forward ... toward a more perfect union where the " @entity146 look " is getting a little bit harder to define			1
that may make a lot of people uncomfortable , but personal discomfort is n't a good enough reason to slight 25 consecutive months of job growth , resurgent house prices and corporations seeing record profit			2
every president since @entity157 has talked about reforming health care , and @entity3 is the one who got it done -- yet his critics say he 's done nothing since he 's been in office			1
now , of course , there is still a lot of work ahead			0
we have a deficit to address , a fiscal cliff that is threatening millions of jobs and a gdp that is limping			0
and the administration is going to make mistakes			0
but now that this election is finally over , maybe more republicans will be willing to take a page from the book of @entity180 gov. @entity179 and give @entity3 some credit for the things he 's done right			2
we can still challenge the president 's ideas without asking for his papers or spitting on our highest office			0
when i think about where this country was four years ago -- with us losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month , engulfed in two wars and disliked by many of our allies -- i believe @entity3 has done a lot that 's right			1
and from the looks of his resounding re-election , the majority of real @entity24 feel the same way			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2

@entity201 : some critics do n't just disagree with him ; they disrespect him
nothing @entity3 has ever done was good enough for them , @entity201 says
but on tuesday , it was good enough for voters , he says
no one needs to take this country back , because it has n't been stolen , says @entity201
