-- as @entity4 's legislators met monday in extraordinary session to consider bills that were not brought to the floor last week , @entity2 @entity1 bemoaned the assignment of a civil - unions bill to a " kill committee " as a harbinger of its likely defeat			1
" sad to see speaker during his speaker 's session assign # civil unions to @entity23 , his kill committee , again thwarting democracy , " said @entity1 in a tweet that referred to house speaker @entity15 and the @entity16 , which has nine members , five of them @entity17			1
none of the @entity17 has expressed support for the bill , he said			1
still , @entity1 , who is gay , held out hope that the bill might ultimately gain passage			1
" we 're going to make our case and maybe somebody will have a change of heart , " he told @entity0 in a telephone interview			0
" we need one person to change their mind			0
" the @entity17 speaker has made no secret of his opposition to the bill , which had garnered bipartisan support			1
" planting corn today , " @entity15 tweeted sunday			0
" what i should be doing tomorrow insread ( sic ) of a special session for the legislature			0
" he expressed similar sentiments monday , when he tweeted , " special legislative session on same sex marriage brought to you by @entity53 @ hickforco and cost picked up by @entity4 families			1
" gov. @entity57 , who had called the special session , said sunday that the bill is not about same - sex marriage , which is banned under @entity4 's constitution			1
and he said the civil unions bill was not the only one that he wished would have passed during the regular session			1
" on the next - to - last day of our legislative session , the civil unions bill came out of committees and they just filibustered , " the @entity65 told @entity0			1
" they would n't let it come to the floor , and when it died , 30 other bills died			2
and these are important to our businesses			0
" but @entity15 said in a telephone interview that the special session amounts to a reset of the process			0
" we start all over again with committee hearings and testimony , " he said			2
" we can get out of here in three days			0
" @entity15 defended his equation of civil unions to same - sex marriage			1
" it 's clearly creating same - sex marriage in @entity4 , " he said about the bill			2
" they can call it whatever they want , but the bottom line is that 's what 's happening here			0
" @entity15 suggested there was a link between what is going on in @entity4 and president @entity101 's announcement last week that he supports same - sex marriage			2
" to me , it 's more than a simple coincidence that all of this is happening at the same time , " @entity15 said			0
" bills die on the calendar every year and we do n't have a special session as a result of it			2
" in a statement , the speaker accused @entity57 and his @entity116 supporters of " pushing a last - minute , divisive attack on our traditional views on marriage for short - term political gain			2
" outside the @entity124 before the special session began , more than 100 gay rights advocates demonstrated monday morning in a call for @entity15 " to give us a fair hearing , " said @entity125 , deputy executive director of one @entity4 , a statewide advocacy organization for gay and transgender @entity127			0
he described as " shameful and unprecedented " last week 's @entity131 shutdown , which blocked consideration not only of the civil unions bill , but of more than 30 other bills			1
a civil union is a legal status created by the state of @entity138 in 2000 and subsequently by a number of other states , according to @entity141 , in a posting on its website			2
" it provides legal protection to couples at the state law level , but omits federal protections as well as the dignity , clarity , security and power of the word ' marriage			0
' " @entity101 said last week that he supports states ' deciding the issue of same - sex marriage on their own , but added that he was " disappointed " by last tuesday 's vote on the issue in @entity161 , where a ban on same - sex marriage was added to the state constitution			1
@entity101 called the amendment discriminatory against gays and lesbians , a spokesman said wednesday			0
five @entity170 states allow civil unions between same - sex couples , but not marriage			1
six states -- @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity138 , @entity178 and @entity179 -- and the @entity181 issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples , while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to define marriage as a heterosexual union			0
in february , @entity188 gov. @entity187 signed a bill that would legalize same - sex marriage beginning in june , but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue			2
@entity197 gov. @entity196 signed into law a bill that permits the state 's same - sex couples to wed as of january 1 , and state residents may vote to affirm such a law			1
@entity204 will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in @entity161 , while @entity206 will have a referendum on allowing same - sex marriage			0
meanwhile , two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice , one from @entity212 and another from @entity175 , could be headed to the @entity170 @entity213 in coming months .			0
