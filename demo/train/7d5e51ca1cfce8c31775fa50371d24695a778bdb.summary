@entity0 -- a journalist at the @entity3 , the @entity4 newspaper that was closed by @entity5 last year , once said : " this is what we do			1
we go out and destroy people 's lives			0
" the @entity4 press , combative and uncompromising , has been a feature of national life for many years			1
but now a high court judge , @entity14 , has decided the government must intervene to ensure it behaves itself			1
will this prove a watershed moment for tabloid newspapers ? or will they revert to type ? the @entity4 press has vowed to clean up its act before , only to end up back where it started			1
when princess @entity25 was killed in @entity26 , with freelance photographers in hot pursuit , the @entity24 vowed never to use paparazzi shots again			1
yet its popular website , @entity31 , now depends on paparazzi images for its success			0
@entity14 was appointed by prime minister @entity34 to carry out a year - long inquiry into press standards when it emerged in july 2011 the @entity3 possibly intercepted voicemail messages left on a cell phone belonging to @entity40 , a murdered schoolgirl , in pursuit of stories			1
it emerged the practice of phone hacking had been widespread at the paper			0
the revelation prompted a wave of public revulsion and left @entity34 in a difficult position			1
he had employed the paper 's former editor @entity52 as his communications director and had a warm personal relationship with another former editor , @entity56 , who ran @entity5 's powerful stable of @entity4 titles			1
the @entity14 report , published on thursday , is 2,000 pages long and runs to nearly 1 million words , but its main recommendation is simple enough			1
the government should pass a law giving @entity66 , a body that already overseas @entity4 broadcasters , the power to approve a new regulatory system that will be independent of the newspaper industry			2
the old system , the @entity73 , was dominated by editors and proved ineffective , @entity14 said			1
@entity34 immediately sparked controversy by declaring he would not pass a law that would give parliament a say in how newspapers are run for the first time in nearly 300 years			1
a glance at friday 's headlines shows that his stance has transformed the pm overnight into a hero in the eyes of newspaper editors and owners			1
in the short - term , the newspapers themselves may be the biggest winners			2
the report says they should continue to regulate themselves , paying for a new complaints body that will be staffed by people from outside the industry			0
it will have the power to levy fines of up to Â £ 1 million and the funds to launch investigations into wrongdoing			0
@entity66 could yet be handed the right to oversee it			0
but in truth a more onerous system could have been imposed			0
the much - maligned police will also find comfort in @entity14 's report			1
@entity110 was criticized for failing to fully investigate phone hacking but the judge accepted its claim it was too busy dealing with possible terrorist threats to prioritize the case			0
some senior police officers were too close to journalists but he found no evidence of corruption			0
politicians were roundly criticized by @entity14 for schmoozing newspaper editors and proprietors for more than 30 years , attending their weddings and birthday parties , enjoying intimate dinners and forming close friendships			1
but none were singled out			0
they too will be relieved @entity14 did n't couch his criticism in stronger terms			2
@entity5 and @entity132 did not get off so lightly			0
@entity14 saved some of his strongest words for the media mogul and his son , a senior executive at the company founded by his father			2
the judge expressed amazement that @entity5 had not sought more information about the likely extent of phone hacking at the @entity3 , one of the company 's flagship titles			0
his failure to read a damning high court judgement about the conduct of @entity3 " says something about the degree to which his organization engages with the ethical direction of its newspapers "			0
referring to @entity5 's claim he did not remember visiting then - prime minister @entity157 to discuss his 1981 takeover bid for the @entity159 at her official country residence , @entity14 said : " it is perhaps a little surprising that he does not remember a visit to a place as memorable as @entity165 in the context of a bid as important as that which he made for @entity172 newspapers			1
however , perhaps that is all i need to say			0
" @entity132 , who ran @entity177 's @entity175 and @entity176 businesses until earlier this year , claimed his own executives had failed to tell him hacking went further than a single reporter at the @entity3			0
but @entity14 said his evidence did not stack up			2
" there are aspects of the account of mr @entity5 that cause me some concern , " he said			0
he did not go further because a major police investigation into phone hacking is ongoing , but the criticism may prove strong enough to damage @entity5 's chance of succeeding his father			2
editors , past and present , are also criticized			2
@entity56 , who edited the @entity3 and its daily sister title @entity192 , was condemned for claiming former pm @entity193 wanted the fact his young son suffered from cystic fibrosis to be made public			0
in fact , the opposite was true , but the @entity192 ran a front - page story revealing the news anyway			0
the @entity4 public , who already hold journalists in low regard , are unlikely to be surprised by any of this			2
nearly 20 years after @entity25 's death , which elicited expressions of remorse from editors , some @entity4 papers printed naked pictures of prince @entity212 in a @entity214 hotel room			1
weeks later , the same papers reacted with fury when a @entity218 magazine carried topless photo of @entity220			0
as @entity14 wryly observed , newspapers apply restraint selectively , and only when it suits them			1
in the meantime , the @entity4 public grumble about journalists , just as they grumble about the weather , but carry on buying their papers anyway , albeit in smaller numbers			2
as @entity14 might also have said , we all get the press we deserve			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			2

after @entity14 's report on press ethics , @entity233 asks what will change
@entity233 : @entity4 press has vowed to clean up its act before , after @entity25 's death
pm @entity34 , newspapers and the police are immediate winners , he says
tabloid editors and the @entity249 were roundly criticized by the report , he adds
