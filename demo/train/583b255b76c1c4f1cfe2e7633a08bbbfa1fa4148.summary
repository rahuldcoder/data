@entity0 -- as the deadline nears for @entity6 troops to exit major @entity8 cities , units in @entity3 are in the midst of a months - long operation to sweep out extremist fighters			1
@entity6 troops have a deadline of june 30 to exit major @entity8 cities			1
the decision on whether to keep troops in the restive northern city beyond june 30 has been a sticking point between the @entity6 and @entity8			1
parts of the city remain under insurgent control and high - profile attacks continue , unlike the vast majority of the country			1
" we still have a major operation going inside of @entity3 with all forces assisting and helping out			2
we expect that to end here within about 30 to 45 days , and then there will be a decision to be made , " the top @entity6 commander in @entity8 , gen. @entity24 , told reporters at the @entity26 on friday			1
" i was just up there saturday , and we conducted a joint assessment , " he said			0
" there 's some problems that we have to work through but , in fact , there 's potential that they [ @entity8 forces ] can handle the mission " when they take over in july			1
despite concerns about the continuing violence , the government of @entity8 said last week it will not extend the deadline for @entity6 combat troops to leave @entity8 cities			1
the joint operation to clear @entity3 of insurgents has been going on for 75 days , neighborhood by neighborhood , according to @entity24			2
" it 's going to take us another 30 days to finish that , " he said			0
@entity3 has become the last major fighting ground in @entity8 as insurgents , mainly @entity55 , were pushed north out of @entity56 during the @entity6 troop " surge " that started in 2007			1
insurgents were able to entrench in the city as @entity6 and @entity8 forces cleared and held @entity56 and other regions			1
a number of @entity6 troops were moved out of @entity3 to help with surge operations farther south , leaving @entity3 and surrounding areas mainly to @entity8 forces and a smaller @entity6 military contingent			1
while @entity24 said the current operations are " having a good impact , " in @entity3 , continued high - profile attacks haunt commanders there			2
on may 1 a suicide bomb was detonated near a coffee shop , killing at least six people			0
five @entity6 soldiers were killed on april 10 when a suicide bomber breached the outer security barrier of @entity8 national police headquarters in southern @entity3			1
it was the single deadliest attack on @entity6 troops in more than a year , the @entity6 military said			2
@entity24 noted the tactic of using women as suicide bombers is being used by insurgents in @entity3			0
" we 've seen a few in @entity3 -- a couple of attacks were connected by @entity92 foreign fighters that came in , we think , through @entity94			0
we actually detained the leader of the cell , so now we 're learning more and more about it , " he said			0
@entity6 and @entity8 forces are also facing a recent increase of attacks in @entity56 , which @entity24 and other @entity6 military officials pin on @entity55 trying to again foment sectarian violence			1
" we 're trying to get inside of these cells			0
we 're trying to understand where they 're coming from and we have been successful			0
we are picking people up , " the general said			0
he said the @entity6 has improved its intelligence sharing with the @entity8 forces over the past six months , helping to impair the ability of the insurgents to move around			2
" their [ @entity8 forces ' ] strength is the human intelligence			0
our strength comes in other ways			0
and so we 're trying to combine those together so we can work toward solving this problem , " he said			0
but with 45 days left until the security agreement with @entity8 takes @entity6 troops in @entity56 off the streets and back to their bases , there is some uncertainty about how @entity8 forces will contain the current violence			1
" there 's a potential that this could actually work , if the @entity8 are able to maintain in the cities and we 're able to , then , to spend more of our time in the support zones outside of the cities , " he said			2
" we actually could come up with , actually , a stronger method of going after these forces			0
but we 'll have to wait and see			0
