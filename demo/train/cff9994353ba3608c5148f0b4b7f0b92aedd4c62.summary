-- country music fans are loyal and they do n't like to see their legends fall			2
@entity4 , one of the genre 's most revered traditional singer - songwriters , was arrested this week after being found naked , smelling apparently of alcohol and lying on a remote roadway in northern @entity9 , authorities said			1
in a genre largely led by artists who can achieve chart - topping tunes and high - grossing concert tours , industry consultants and radio station personalities say @entity4 , 53 , faces significant challenges ahead and should first address whatever issues may have led to this incident			1
country 's unique " cradle to the grave " fan base will likely stick with @entity4 , one industry expert told @entity0			1
" country music fans are notorious for their loyalty , " said @entity23 , senior chart manager for @entity24 in @entity25			2
" they tend to live the artist 's lives with them -- good , or bad , ( but ) only up to a point			2
" country singer @entity4 arrested , accused of @entity32 some say @entity4 may have reached that point tuesday evening			1
@entity4 was driving his black 1998 @entity35 , which went off the north side of a highway just west of @entity38 , @entity9 , where he resides , and struck several barricades in a construction zone , said @entity42 trooper @entity41			1
@entity4 was found naked , @entity41 said			1
when the singer was brought to @entity45 at 3 a.m. , after a hospital visit , he still did n't have clothes , sgt. @entity43 said			2
" he was given a paper suit , which is a jail uniform made out of paper , " @entity43 told @entity0			2
@entity4 was charged with driving while intoxicated and felony retaliation , after allegedly threatening to fatally shoot highway patrol troopers who responded to a concerned caller who notified authorities of " a man lying in the roadway " tuesday			1
the incident happened just six months after he pleaded no contest to public intoxication in another case			1
the singer 's camp has not responded to @entity0 requests for comment			2
@entity4 , of course , is n't the first country star to run into problems			1
@entity67 and @entity68 were known for their tumultuous lifestyles and drinking			0
@entity68 even earned the moniker " @entity68 " because he missed so many performances			0
" the difference is @entity68 had his clothes on , " said country radio consultant @entity74			2
and it 's certainly not the first time a celebrity from any genre has found himself in the middle of a personal and public relations challenge			0
@entity85 star @entity84 worked his way back up the charts after he was convicted three years ago of assaulting ex-girlfriend @entity88			2
former " @entity90 " star @entity89 is back on television after a very public firing and meltdown			0
@entity94 , a @entity25 - based publicist who has represented country singers , said @entity4 should postpone his current tour and issue a statement indicating he is getting help			1
" he should apologize to the officer , the public , friends and fans to indicate he will get his life back on track , " said @entity94			0
@entity4 burst onto the country music scene in 1986 with " @entity106			1
" the @entity109 - born singer 's debut album sold nearly 4 million copies and made him a star of the " new traditional " scene			2
@entity4 was in his heyday from the mid- 1980s to the mid- 1990s , recording such classics as " @entity115 " and " @entity116			1
" his baritone voice and songs and even his retro wardrobe harkened to a traditional country style			0
@entity121 , now program director at @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity125 , said @entity4 and @entity126 came in like a breath of fresh air during the mid- 1980s , when country radio stations were suffering low ratings			1
" it was horrible , " said @entity121			0
" we were just coming out of @entity134 and the whole ' urban cowboy ' thing			0
" @entity4 ran out a string of successful songs and albums			1
" the two of them together saved the format , " @entity121 said			0
" i do n't know why @entity68 endured and @entity4 did n't			1
" @entity4 eventually moved toward gospel music and today he largely plays smaller venues , including casinos			1
@entity126 , meanwhile , is still bringing large crowds to arenas			0
while he has a predictable sound , according to @entity24 's @entity23 , @entity152 " is very adept at making it sound fresh from album to album			0
" " i do n't think we can blame @entity4 ' decline on the format , " @entity23 said			1
long time since a hit record observers point out that @entity4 has n't had a top - selling record for a decade			1
finding one now could give him a needed boost			0
" he has to make a hit record that will work on country radio with today 's country fans , " said @entity74			2
" you would be hard - pressed to find a @entity4 song on a contemporary country radio station today			1
" an estimated 2,000 stations , most of them " contemporary , " are considered the primary marketing vehicle for country music , @entity23 told @entity0			0
listeners ages 25 to 54 are the key demographic , and successful musicians keep the songs coming			0
" if you take it in general terms , @entity4 is considered a veteran artist , " said @entity23			1
" @entity4 does n't have singles on the radio all the time			1
current artists have a new single on the radio all the time			2

@entity4 ' last major hit came in 2002 with " @entity202 , " a song about faith and redemption			1
there are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway , why there 's not four of them , @entity210 only knows			0
i guess it 's not what you take when you leave this world behind you , it 's what you leave behind you when you go			0
@entity4 " was able to tell it with sincerity and it was a hit , " @entity23 said			1
@entity223 , program director and on - air personality at @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity227 , said her station plays some traditional country songs favored by the likes of @entity4			1
" if it is not the right song , it is hard to find the right place to play it , " @entity231 told @entity0			2
@entity235 provides consultant services to 27 stations , a few of which are " classic " -- meaning they play songs from the 1950s to the 1990s			2
he spoke thursday with an individual at one such station			0
while they discussed @entity4 ' most recent incident , they never discussed whether his songs should be taken off the air			1
" i do n't think the legacy of his music is necessarily tarnished by what he did , " said @entity74			0
difficulties include lawsuits the past two years have been difficult ones for @entity4			1
he divorced his longtime wife in 2010			0
according to a lawsuit filed earlier this year , @entity258 remained his personal manager until she terminated the agreement in 2011 -- without proper notice , the suit alleges			0
