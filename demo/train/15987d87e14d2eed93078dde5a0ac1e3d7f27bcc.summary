-- stalk much ? @entity1 , a new app for the site , is super simple -- and will probably be super popular			1
it lets users pick certain friends whose relationship status they 'd like to monitor			1
if one of those relationships changes , the user gets notified by e-mail			2
they 're in a relationship			0
be the first to know when they 're out of it , " promises the app 's website			0
so , if that old high school flame suddenly becomes " single " or the receptionist you 've pined for decides that her on - again , off - again relationship is now " complicated , " you can swoop right in			0
created by developer @entity23 , the app , at least in concept , definitely has a stalkerish vibe			0
but among single - and - interested folks , who can deny that the social - networking mega-site is used to keep up with the romantic doings of others ? " sure , it 's a little creepy but i imagine that it will be hugely popular , " wrote @entity32 for the tech blog @entity34			0
" [ a ] nd hey , if you 're worried about being stalked maybe you should be more careful about who you approve as a @entity1 friend ? " theoretically , the app could be used by friends who just want to keep up with the love lives of their buddies so they can be there with a pint of ice cream and a shoulder to cry on when things go sour			1
as of last week , there could be more relationship statuses changing than usual			2
@entity1 added " in a civil union " and " in a domestic partnership " to its list of options .			1

@entity1 lets users pick friends and monitor their relationship statuses
if a relationship status changes , the app notifies the user
@entity1 just added civil unions and domestic partnerships to its relationship list
