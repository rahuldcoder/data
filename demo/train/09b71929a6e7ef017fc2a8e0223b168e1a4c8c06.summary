@entity0 -- convicted " shoe bomber " @entity2 was given permission to correspond from prison with members of his family this summer , after the @entity7 allowed restrictions on him to expire			1
@entity2 was arrested in december 2001 , accused of trying to blow up a plane with explosives in his shoes			1
but several homeland security experts say that even with wardens screening every letter , they 'd prefer to see imprisoned terrorists held completely incommunicado			1
" if a terrorist can communicate with his family , with other associates -- even with monitoring -- he could use codes ; he could be directing other terrorist acts , " said former @entity20 @entity19 , who is now a security consultant			1
" this is somebody who tried to blow up hundreds of innocent people on an airliner , and in my view , he should be totally restricted			1
" @entity19 first voiced his concern in an interview with the @entity35 over the weekend			0
watch reaction to new rights for @entity2 Â» the @entity38 - born @entity2 pleaded guilty seven years ago to trying to blow up a jetliner flying from @entity40 , @entity41 , to @entity42 , @entity43 , in december 2001 using explosives hidden in his shoes			1
he was sentenced to life in prison and is jailed at the high - security " @entity52 " federal penitentiary in @entity50 , @entity51			2
a @entity7 spokesman said that after a thorough review , the special administrative measures that @entity2 had been under were not renewed in june , on the recommendation of three agencies : the @entity57 , the prosecuting @entity60 attorney 's office and the @entity7 's @entity61			1
@entity2 had sued the @entity7 over the issue			1
even with the restriction lifted , @entity64 spokeswoman @entity63 says , the only people a @entity52 inmate can correspond with are his direct family members , his attorneys and the media			2
in addition , " any regular inmates , especially terrorism convicts , have all their communications screened , both incoming and outgoing , " she said			0
but limiting letters to family members does not prevent wider dissemination , says @entity77 , former inspector general for the @entity78			2
" those letters could be forwarded by family members to others , " he said			2
another risk , according to @entity77 : " the propaganda potential is huge for these kinds of things			0
terrorists can be hugely inspiring figures " to young militants hearing jailhouse manifestos , he says			0
several years ago , three convicted terrorists from the 1993 @entity90 bombing managed to send at least 90 letters to militants overseas , including those linked to the @entity93 , @entity94 , train bombings			0
and according to a @entity7 's inspector general report of september 2006 , one of them also " praised @entity96 as a hero in a letter sent to @entity100 newspapers			0
" but in the wake of that report , @entity7 spokesman @entity102 says , all phone calls and mail from international terrorist inmates are now screened			0
" @entity108 is not delivered to or sent from such inmates until it is read ( translated if necessary ) and analyzed for intelligence purposes , " with the help of @entity57 personnel and on - site @entity113 - language specialists , @entity102 says			0
" if suspicious content is found , the correspondence is referred to the @entity57 for analysis before being processed any further			0
" in addition to @entity2 , @entity52 houses some of the most notorious convicted terrorists , including 1993 @entity90 bombing mastermind @entity120 , september 11 conspirator @entity121 , " dirty bomb " plotter @entity122 and " millennium bomb " plotter @entity125			1
