-- facing widespread outrage over the @entity5 's response to the @entity7 , @entity8 , school massacre , the group 's president thursday tried to clarify , saying that schools should decide for themselves how to protect their children			1
" some will want police officers there			2
others of them will want private security guards , " @entity13 said in an exclusive @entity0 interview			1
" there may be some place they want volunteers to do it			2
we 're willing to work with everybody on those questions			2
" the nation 's largest teachers union liked some of @entity13 's comments , but said the @entity5 is ignoring crucial points to prevent school shootings			1
@entity13 's interview came nearly a week after @entity5 executive vice president @entity32 addressed media -- but did not take questions -- and said that all schools in the @entity36 should immediately have armed officers			1
that is the only way , @entity32 said , to prevent another massacre like that at @entity41 , which left 20 children and six adults dead			1
on december 21 , @entity32 called for armed officers in " every single school " and said that action should be taken before children return to school at the start of the year			1
" i call on @entity50 today to act immediately to appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation and to do it now to make sure that blanket safety is in place when our kids return to school in january , " he said			1
@entity32 continued , " before @entity50 reconvenes , before we engage in any lengthy debate over legislation , regulation or anything else , as soon as our kids return to school after the holiday break , we need to have every single school in @entity36 immediately deploy a protection program proven to work , and by that i mean armed security			1
" read transcript of @entity32 's statement on thursday , @entity13 took questions about @entity32 's statements , which were heavily criticized , even by some @entity5 members			1
the @entity5 boasts 4 million members			1
" whether an individual school wants that kind of protection or does n't want that kind of protection is really up to the individual school , " @entity13 said			1
" and when we made that statement , when @entity32 spoke about a week ago , he suggested that what has to happen , and what should happen , is in every school district , administrators , teachers and parents should sit down and ask what 's needed to protect the students in that school			1
" @entity13 seemed to be broadening the @entity5 's position by encouraging wider discussion , said @entity97 , executive director of the @entity98 , a nonprofit nonpolitical group that trains armed officers in schools			1
but @entity97 is alarmed that the @entity5 thinks " armed guards " in school is a solution			1
in his nationally televised address on december 21 , @entity32 said armed guards should work in school like they do at " airports , office buildings , power plants , court houses , even sports stadiums			1
" " we want some clarification on what he means by armed guard , " said @entity97			2
" an officer working in a school has to work with students , be engaged in the school day , develop relationships with students			2
they must be trained to do that , to be involved			0
" " we feel that could create more problems than it solves , " he said			0
while talk continued , in @entity130 teachers were learning how to shoot			0
the @entity131 and the @entity130 - based website opsgear.com are offering a free shooting class this week to teachers			1
the " safe to learn @entity137 to teach " class is free and lasts for six hours , just as extensive as a routine conceal - and - carry training course in the state			1
the course covers how to handle a firearm , how to carry it and maintain it , and provides information about @entity130 and federal handgun laws			0
council chairman @entity143 explained why be believes teachers should learn to fire weapons			0
" when we talk about more guns , are more guns the answer ? who do you think they call and why do they call the police when something like this happens ? " he said on @entity0 thursday			0
" because they know the police will show up with their guns			0
the only problem is the police show up a little too late			0
they have lots of guns and equipment and man power , but just a little too late			0
" the first responders at @entity7 and in @entity170 were the teachers themselves , who put their lives in front of these shooters , " he said			0
" let 's not disarm these folks			1
" teachers in @entity130 have had guns in the classroom for years , he said			0
" this is not new for @entity130			0
you just have n't heard about it before , " @entity143 said			0
" teachers have been carrying firearms in locked drawers for 12 years now			0
and my opponents will say the dire predictions were going to be that every argument between a teacher and student would result in gunfire			1
" that has n't happened			0
we have n't had accidental shootings			0
we have n't had guns left behind			0
and we also have n't had any [ school ] gun shootings			0
" but there are some who oppose the idea			1
former special education teacher @entity202 told @entity0 affiliate @entity203 that having a firearm at school makes her nervous			2
" i would be terrified that one of my students would find my weapon and bring it out , " she said			0
armed guards , too , are not an absolute solution either , said the @entity211 , an influential teachers ' union with 3 million members			2
to argue otherwise " denies the tragedy at @entity170 , " @entity211 president @entity214 told @entity0 , reacting to @entity13 's interview			1
" they had armed guards and it did n't stop the tragedy			0
" an armed guard watching @entity221 's @entity220 in 1999 was unable to prevent the slayings			2
the county sheriff 's office released an account explaining why			2
" at @entity7 , the doors were locked , " @entity214 added			0
" they had a buzzer			0
" @entity97 said that the push for armed , trained police officers in @entity36 schools goes back to the 1950s			2
but an effort to put guards in schools was federally funded during the @entity237 presidency			2
school - based partnership grants in the 1990s paid police agencies to send officers into schools in order to reduce school - related crimes such as drug dealing or alcohol use on campus			1
the grant program awarded more than $ 17 million to 155 agencies in the late 1990s , according to the @entity249			0
the program has not been funded recently			0
while @entity214 agreed that it might be wise to return to that , guards in school can not be the only solution			0
" @entity13 's statement includes good things and neglected points , " he said			1
" the part about how everyone needs to sit down is a good point			0
what 's missing is there are other solutions that should be addressed , including metal health and common sense laws that keep guns out of the hands of people that should n't have them			2
" @entity214 believes there must be a debate over banning large ammunition magazines like the kind @entity277 used to mow down his victims at @entity41			1
@entity32 , at least , seems hesitant to consider that			1
he appeared on @entity281 's @entity280 a few days after he gave his december 21 statement to reporters			2
@entity286 magazines , @entity32 said , is " not going to make any kid safer			1

@entity5 president @entity13 says there should be discussion first about arming schools
executive *vp* @entity32 said last week that schools should arm " immediately "
discussion comes after massacre at @entity41 in @entity8
teacher 's union *welcomes* @entity5 idea for broad - based discussions
