-- since 2008 , @entity1 and his nonprofit , @entity2 , have provided hundreds of wheelchairs and mobility aids to people living with disabilities in rural @entity7			1
@entity8 and his group also teach recipients how to use their chairs and maximize their quality of life			1
@entity0 asked @entity8 for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the @entity16 of 2011			1
@entity0 : where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a @entity16 @entity20 ? @entity1 : i was at home in @entity23 , @entity7			1
i am honored to be one of the @entity16			2
the door has been opened to show the world the huge need for wheelchairs in @entity7 , the plight of those who are stuck in their house because they ca n't move , and all the lives we are changing			1
@entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean to the @entity2 ? @entity8 : i hope that many people and organizations will come alongside of @entity2 to help provide mobility and a better quality of life to the many disabled of @entity7			1
... i hope that people will realize that poverty is poverty and ( that ) those who have so much ( should ) help those in desperate need , in whatever country			2
i hope new volunteers , individuals or organizations -- from schools , churches -- will come to @entity7 to give away a wheelchair , to encourage , to inspire and to change a life			1
i started this organization because i saw the happiness , joy and ability of @entity60 , a 17 - year - old girl who i gave her first wheelchair			2
when @entity64 volunteers participate in a wheelchair donation , they realize the huge difference they can make in another person 's life and the unexplainable feeling of watching someone get up off the floor into their first wheelchair			2
the one who receives the wheelchair laughs , and the mother cries tears of joy			2
i hope that not a single used wheelchair in the @entity64 will ever be thrown into a dump and that every wheelchair that is sitting in a garage or basement will now be given to someone who desperately needs it			2
i hope this award means we will be able to provide a new life and opportunities to all those in @entity7 who deserve to be as independent and successful as people with disabilities in the @entity64 @entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a @entity95 ? @entity8 : every penny will go to @entity2 to continue the work we 're doing			1
in the past couple months , our financial levels have been dropping , and i was wondering if we would last another year			0
we have new cities we want to go to , and there are thousands of people in @entity7 who need wheelchairs			1
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity8 : in many rural , impoverished , uneducated areas of @entity7 , people do n't even know what a wheelchair is			1
they do n't know what their disability is or why they ca n't walk			0
they have no hope , no expectation for the future , and no resources to change their situation			0
... we host clinics and camps to teach them how to use their wheelchairs so they can get out of their house			0
we use able and disabled volunteers to encourage them and give them hope			0
the @entity7 government is trying to help , but does n't have the financial resources or connections in remote areas to contact or help everyone			1
many people in tiny pueblos have no electricity , dirt floors and cook using a wood stove			0
for a person with a disability to have a wheelchair is an unthought - of luxury			0
i have seen the lives of many people changed after receiving a wheelchair			2
@entity148 , who fell out of a tree when he was 12 , is now an artist and helps support his family			0
@entity151 s was in a car accident , is now married , works in @entity153 and has been promoted from greeter to the electronics department			0
@entity60 is married and has two children			0
( with ) a wheelchair , some motivation , a new perspective , love -- a new life is created			0
no degree , no training , no qualification is necessary			0
just a willingness to provide mobility , motivate and encourage are all that is needed to help someone get to where they never imagined they could be			0
