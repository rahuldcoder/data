@entity1 prime minister @entity0 does not deny a report that he told @entity4 secretary of state @entity3 and @entity4 ambassador to @entity1 @entity6 " not to ever second guess me again " on how to deal with @entity7 , though he said the report did not reflect the general " tone and substance " of the calls			1
" first let me make a general statement about our relationship with the @entity4 , " @entity0 said in @entity12 on saturday evening when an @entity4 journalist asked about the report from @entity15 of the @entity16			1
" i think the @entity4 has been terrific			0
" @entity0 then praised president @entity21 's " unequivocal stand with @entity1 on our right to defend ourselves " as well as the " untiring efforts " of @entity3			2
he also called @entity6 " a great ambassador " and thanked @entity25 for passing an additional $ 225 million to help @entity1 pay for its @entity27 defense system			0
some @entity1 officials believed the attempt by @entity3 and @entity32 @entity31 ban ki - moon to broker a cease - fire with @entity7 -- the militant group that controls @entity35 and which the @entity4 government considers to be a terrorist organization -- was ill - conceived			2
just 90 minutes into the 72 - hour cease - fire , @entity1 accused @entity7 of breaking it with an attack on @entity1 soldiers through one of its tunnels			0
though officials tend to sing from the same song sheet in public , there is a clear behind - the - scenes tension between the @entity21 and @entity0 administrations over many issues , sources tell @entity52 -- including whether @entity1 's military operations in @entity35 are excessive and resulting in preventable civilian deaths			1
in his news conference saturday night , @entity0 attempted to lump in the @entity16 report , which neither @entity4 nor @entity1 officials have denied , with a supposed transcript of a phone call between @entity21 and @entity0 that has been widely rejected as bogus by officials in both governments			1
" there is a lot of support and we deeply appreciate it , and that is the substance of our relationship , that 's the tone of our relationship , which gets to the question of these reports that are not only of my conversation with ambassador @entity6 but also with the president that are full of incorrections , full of distortions and are wrong in both tone and substance			0

@entity16 report said @entity0 had *warned* @entity3 on second - guessing him
@entity0 does *n't* deny it , but says the report *missed* the general " tone " of the calls
" i think the @entity4 has been terrific , " @entity0 adds
sources say the @entity21 and @entity0 administrations are at odds over @entity35
