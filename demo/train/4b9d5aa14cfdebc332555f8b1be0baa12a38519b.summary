-- @entity1 has granted citizenship to thousands of stateless people in the country 's @entity5 region , a move seen as a gesture to placate the predominantly @entity11 country 's restive minority			1
state - run media said president @entity13 on thursday issued a legislative decree granting " @entity1 @entity11 nationality " to people registered as " foreigners " in @entity17 , the northeastern region where @entity18 reside			1
there has long been discontent in the @entity5 region , and protests have been held there in recent days			0
many @entity18 have been stateless , and @entity24 said they have faced obstacles , such as getting work and state services			1
@entity28 has promised to deal with the issue over the years			0
" in 1962 , an exceptional census stripped some 120,000 @entity31 -- 20 percent of the @entity1 @entity5 population -- of their @entity1 citizenship			1
by many accounts , the special census was carried out in an arbitrary manner , " @entity24 said in a july report			2
" brothers from the same family , born in the same @entity1 village , were classified differently			2
fathers became foreigners while their sons remained citizens			0
the number of stateless @entity18 grew with time as descendants of those who lost citizenship in 1962 multiplied ; as a result , their number is now estimated at 300,000			1
" @entity24 , which notes that the @entity18 are the largest non-arab ethnic minority in @entity1 , estimated the @entity5 population to be 1.7 million , about 10 percent of @entity1 's population			1
the @entity1 government , viewing @entity5 identity as a threat , has suppressed the group 's political and cultural rights			1
demonstrations in 2004 over longstanding complaints led to harassment and protests were put down with " lethal force , " @entity24 said			2
at that time , at least 36 people were killed , 160 were injured , and more than 2,000 detained amid " widespread reports of torture and ill - treatment of detainees , " @entity24 said			2
@entity68 , a @entity5 journalist and human rights defender based in @entity70 , told @entity0 there are two forms of stateless @entity18 -- the majority , around 220,000 , are called " foreigners " and they are the ones that the decree addresses			1
but there 's another class of stateless people , numbering about 80,000 , who are n't included in the decision			0
" this is not enough			0
we need more , " @entity68 said , referring to the political , social , and economic demands the people have made for decades			0
" we as @entity18 in @entity1 do not have the minimal ethnic rights , no schools , no cultural centers			1
we can not even use our languages in the universities			0
we want to be equal to the @entity18 living in @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			2
" he said the regime made the move to placate @entity18 , who 've been angry over their treatment			1
however , three major @entity5 parties have called for protests friday in @entity100 , @entity101 and other @entity1 cities			2
along with the basic rights they want , @entity18 would like to see the @entity105 rule come to an end and have more political parties formed			0
they also want freedoms in media and other realms , @entity68 said			0
they do n't want to see the controversial 48 - year - old emergency rule replaced by an equally oppressive terrorism law , and they demand a civilian rather than a military court system			0
@entity0 's @entity115 contributed to this report .			0
