-- the ex-boyfriend of @entity3 exchange student @entity2 says he has returned to @entity4 to fight his new murder conviction in the death of @entity8 's onetime roommate , @entity9			1
in a @entity0 interview monday evening , @entity10 said he and his current girlfriend were in neighboring @entity13 , preparing to celebrate what he had expected to be his exoneration by an @entity4 court			1
instead , that court found @entity8 and @entity10 guilty for a second time last week , sentencing him to 25 years			1
@entity8 , who returned to the @entity3 after her 2009 conviction was overturned , said last week that she " will never go willingly " back to @entity4			1
but @entity10 said he came back " as soon as i understood the verdict			2
" " i 'm trying to be as positive as possible in a situation like this , " he said			0
" it 's very traumatic , the situation here now			2
but on the other side , i still have to fight			0
i have chosen to be here and to fight against this ordeal			0
" @entity4 police said @entity10 was stopped in the northern @entity4 town of @entity32 , near the border with @entity13 and @entity34			1
in an interview on @entity0 's " @entity36 360 , " @entity10 said he thought his relationship with @entity8 hurt him			1
" why do they convict me ? " he said			0
" why do put me on the corner and say that i 'm guilty just because in their minds i have to be guilty because i was her boyfriend			0
it does n't make any sense to me			0
" @entity45 , 21 , of @entity46 , was found stabbed to death in 2007 in the house she shared with @entity8 in @entity49 , where both women were exchange students			2
prosecutors said @entity45 was killed after she rejected attempts by @entity8 , @entity10 and another man , @entity54 - born @entity9 , to involve her in a sex game			1
@entity56 is the only person in jail for the murder , and many aspects of the crime still remain unexplained			0
both @entity8 and @entity10 have maintained their innocence , and their 2009 convictions led to questions about the effectiveness of @entity4 's justice system			1
the trial revealed widespread doubts over the handling of the investigation and key pieces of evidence , and the convictions were overturned on appeal in 2011			0
but in march 2013 , @entity4 's @entity76 overturned the pair 's acquittals and ordered a retrial			2
that proceeding resulted in the convictions being reinstated on thursday			0
" i do n't know what to think , because objectively , there 's nothing against me and nothing very strong against @entity2 , " @entity10 said			1
