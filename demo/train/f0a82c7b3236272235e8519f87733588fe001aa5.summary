@entity0 -- health care reform is a signature issue for @entity4 , but the attempt to overhaul the nation 's health system has pitted liberals against centrists , exposing fissures 11 months before the 2010 midterm elections			1
a year ago @entity4 were united in victory after winning back the @entity13 and picking up additional seats in @entity15			2
but with victory comes expectations that are accentuated when a party controls both ends of @entity20			0
for @entity4 , it is the party 's political base -- voters who turned out in 2008 to help elect @entity25 president and boost the @entity27 majorities in the @entity13 and @entity28 -- which is demanding results			1
simply by the numbers , the health care overhaul should easily pass @entity15			1
@entity4 comfortably control the @entity32 , and with the assistance of two @entity27 - allied independents have the 60 votes needed to overcome a @entity37 filibuster in the @entity28			1
except it is not about numbers on health care			1
it is about differences in ideology on the public option and abortion that has slowed down the bill			1
@entity48 advocacy organizations wasted little time this week condemning @entity27 leaders when news broke that a @entity28 deal had been struck to replace the public option with another proposal to help cover the uninsured			1
the deal was intended to address concerns by some centrist @entity4 over the public option			1
the news enraged some liberal activists			0
@entity61 organizers sent a note to the e-mail boxes of its 5 million members			0
it opened with three words : " how could they ? " " @entity4 have just announced a tentative health care deal that does n't appear to include a real public health insurance option , " the organizers wrote in the note			1
" instead of pulling out all the stops , they 've bargained away the heart of health care reform -- allowing conservative senators like @entity76 and @entity77 to hold the process hostage and protect @entity79			1
" @entity76 is an independent from @entity81 politically aligned to the @entity27			2
@entity77 is a centrist @entity82 from @entity83			0
the @entity84 was more aggressive in its reaction			0
" this is outrageous , " @entity84 officials wrote in an e-mail that was sent to 300,000 people			0
" we need to fight back now			0
" the fissures in the @entity27 do not end at health care			1
the president 's decision to send 30,000 additional @entity95 troops to @entity96 was met with skepticism by some @entity27 lawmakers and outright opposition by others			1
the decision frustrated anti-war groups			0
" in terms of the policy , i think it is a dreadful mistake , " said former rep. @entity103 , a @entity104 @entity82 who is national director of @entity105			0
" the whole idea of getting out of @entity96 by escalating is like fighting a fire by throwing gasoline on it			2
" some liberals express concern that policy decisions made by the @entity25 administration and @entity27 leaders could hurt the party in the 2010 elections			1
" i think the @entity27 base -- the danger is it becomes a no - show in 2010 , " @entity103 said			2
" an element that was so critical to the success in 2006 and 2008 is going to be on the sidelines			0
people are going to be so dispirited			0
" @entity127 , @entity61 's director of political advocacy , echoed @entity103 ' concern and said that while @entity61 members " trust " @entity25 , " they are sincerely concerned about the gap between his campaign promises and the reality of the legislation that is being passed			2
" " i think we are going to see , if this trajectory plays out , a depression in 2010 and that is deeply concerning , " she said			0
an analysis of @entity1 polling indicates that support for the president and congressional @entity4 has slipped among self - described liberals			1
in june , a @entity148 poll showed that @entity25 had an 89 percent favorable rating with liberals			2
in december , his favorable rating with this group fell to 73 percent			0
in october , a @entity1 / @entity154 poll showed @entity4 had an 87 percent favorable rating with liberals on the generic congressional ballot			2
it has since dropped to 79 percent			0
" from @entity96 to the public option to abortion to the economy , the past few months have seen president @entity25 and @entity4 in @entity15 taking actions that some liberals do n't like , " said @entity158 , @entity1 's polling director			1
at the same time , @entity25 is facing increasing pressure from the @entity165 to pay more attention to issues affecting the @entity169 - @entity95 community			2
rep. @entity170 , @entity171 , issued a statement following the president 's economic speech this week that prodded him to do as much			0
" while we agree with the president that support for small businesses , infrastructure investment and green jobs is essential , we also believe that much more needs to be done , particularly for those @entity95 who are hurting most , " said @entity175 , chairwoman of the caucus			2
one of the more troubling signs for @entity4 , perhaps , is that liberal advocacy groups have been spending money on television ads targeting @entity27 lawmakers on health care			1
after the @entity13 approved its health care bill , @entity61 ran tv ads against seven @entity27 lawmakers criticizing them for voting against it			1
the @entity84 also has run ads against @entity4 as has @entity196 , an umbrella group that represents 1,000 organizations , including major unions and liberal - leaning groups			0
there is even an organization that is trying to recruit liberal candidates to challenge more conservative democrats in next year 's primaries			0
but for all the talk of @entity27 infighting , a senior official at the @entity206 shrugged it off and said disagreements are par for the course when you have a " big tent " party			1
" what is occurring in the @entity27 is no different than what always occurs in the @entity27 , " said @entity215 , the @entity206 communications director			2
" it is the most diverse collection of people and ideas of any political party that has walked the face of the earth ... from the very liberal members to the very conservative members			0
it really is no surprise that when you have such a big and diverse party there are going to be differences			0

@entity27 differences on public option , abortion slows down health care overhaul
move for more @entity96 troops also stirs opposition among @entity4
support for president @entity25 , congressional democrats slip among liberals
