-- for all the difficulties of the @entity4 's rollout , @entity1 are more patient than you might think : a new poll shows a majority expressing optimism that the problems are going to be ironed out			1
not only that , a majority continues to support the law or think it did n't go far enough			0
nevertheless , the conservatives rooting for its demise have been expressing not just vindication , but triumph			2
" we could be looking at the collapse of @entity1 liberalism , " said columnist @entity19			1
" liberalism is crumbling in front of our eyes , " echoed @entity22			0
yes indeed , a glitchy website and people moving from junk insurance to real insurance prove once and for all that government should have as little to do with health care as possible , and the entire liberal project lies in tatters			1
that 's a little like proclaiming that your team will inevitably lose the @entity36 , then go bankrupt and disband because the other team scored a run in the first inning of game 1			0
but the momentary political situation aside , conservatives still face a fundamental problem when they confront @entity1 's health care system			1
their ideology dictates only one solution to all health care problems , and that solution -- less government , more free market -- is exactly what gave us our dysfunctional health care system in the first place			1
let 's step back a moment to consider why we needed the @entity4 and what it says about the health care market			1
the basic conservative position is that the more you let market forces operate , the better the outcome will be			0
" more markets " is the answer to everything : let people buy insurance across state lines			0
make it virtually impossible to sue for medical malpractice			0
create more health savings accounts			0
but where do you think the problems of @entity1 's health care system came from ? it was n't government that gave us nearly 50 million uninsured @entity1 and denials for pre-existing conditions			1
it was n't government that gave us the yearly and lifetime caps on insurance coverage that have sent so many people into bankruptcy when they 've faced a serious illness or accident			0
it was n't government that gave us " rescissions , " where your insurance company cancels your policy if you get sick			0
it was n't government that gave us a system in which the gap between what we spend and what we get is so enormous			2
it was the free market			0
the conservatives who profess to love markets so dearly seem unable to grasp that the market for health care is n't like the market for shoes or cars			1
other developed countries understand this			0
every one of our peer nations has a system with more government control than ours , ranging from almost completely socialized systems like @entity115 's to ones like those in @entity118 and the @entity119 , which resemble @entity4 but with tighter regulation			1
we do n't have to wonder whether a health care system built on capitalist profit - seeking is more efficient and less expensive than those in which the government exercises more control			1
there has been a test running for decades , with many developed countries doing it one way , and the @entity1 doing it the other			2
the results could n't be clearer			0
on almost any criterion you can come up with , the government - controlled systems work better			2
they cover everyone , while spending far less than we do			0
their health outcomes are as good or better than ours			0
a recent @entity144 analysis rated @entity1 's as the world 's 46th most efficient health system , right above @entity147 and right below @entity148			1
among the developed countries in the @entity150 , the @entity1 ranks first ( by a mile ) in health spending per capita , but 26th in life expectancy			1
there are some , however , who love the @entity1 health care system			1
@entity1 doctors make far higher salaries than their counterparts in other countries			2
@entity1 insurance companies do very well			2
as a recent @entity165 investigation revealed , makers of devices like artificial hips mark up their prices double , triple , or even more when they sell to @entity1 hospitals as they do when they sell the same devices to @entity172 hospitals			2
the same is true of a hundred other devices and procedures			0
why ? because in @entity172 , @entity176 , and other places with highly regulated health care , government rules keep the costs low			1
in the @entity1 system , there are multiple points where companies do the rational thing : extract as much money as possible from the system			1
that 's why an mri costs three times as much in the @entity1 as it does in @entity190 or @entity191			1
but people living under the oppression of those other governments ' systems must hate them , right ? wrong			0
the @entity197 recently released a study of health systems in 10 developed countries around the world which included a survey of satisfaction			1
@entity1 's health system was the least popular , with only 25 % of @entity1 saying it works well and the other 75 % saying it should be fundamentally changed or completely rebuilt			1
the most popular was the most socialized , @entity115 's , with 63 % saying it works well			0
you may remember that the opening ceremonies of the 2012 summer olympics in @entity211 included a tribute to the @entity213 , so proud are @entity214 of their health system			2
despite all the problems created by @entity1 's private health care market , we do have versions of big - government , socialized insurance			1
they 're called @entity224 and @entity225			0
they are far more efficient than private insurance , and @entity224 recipients in particular love their coverage			0
it 's no accident that in every election , @entity231 -- who fought against the creation of @entity224 and would love to privatize it -- try to pretend to voters that they 're the program 's greatest defenders			0
the champions of free - market capitalism decide they ca n't get elected without supporting a single - payer insurance program			0
in all their glee about the troubled rollout of the @entity4 , most republicans are barely bothering to offer an alternative , other than a return to the way things used to be			2
it is n't surprising , because to be brutally frank , they never much cared about the spectacular human suffering created by free - market health care			1
for decades , liberals have been working to devise policy solutions and create the political conditions for health care reform that would achieve secure , universal coverage			1
on the other hand , in the face of millions who ca n't get insurance because of pre-existing conditions and millions more who just ca n't afford it , the conservative response was always , " whatever			0
" the market spoke , and you lost			0
the @entity4 can certainly be improved			2
but in health care -- to paraphrase @entity270 -- the free market is n't the answer to our problems			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity278 .			2

@entity278 : @entity1 still optimistic @entity4 will be fixed ; conservatives hope not
he says conservatives *ignore* that market solutions on health care have led to failed system
he says @entity1 's peer nations all have government control in their *successful* health systems
@entity278 : health care has been *incredibly* costly , *exclusionary* ; conservatives say : " whatever "
