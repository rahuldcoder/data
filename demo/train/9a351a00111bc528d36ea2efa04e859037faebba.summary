-- a lot of folks in @entity3 , @entity4 , are hoping for a " @entity6 miracle " for the city 's , and perhaps the world 's , most - arrested man			1
it 's a dubious honor , for sure , but @entity11 , 64 , has become a sort of celebrity , especially among students and police in the city of 300,000			1
to many , the homeless gent goes by @entity18 , after the " @entity18 , " and can often be found singing and shaking his moneymaker for change to buy his next drink			1
hence , the arrests -- which have topped 1,500 , according to @entity24 , which is owned by @entity0 's parent company			2
@entity11 was scheduled to appear in a @entity27 court thursday for a probation revocation hearing after being arrested for alcohol intoxication last week , landing him in jail for his third @entity32 in five years			1
he also spent his 64th birthday there in october , @entity24 reported			0
" there was a period where we could n't access his arrests			0
we think he has likely passed 1,600 , but decided to play it safe , " site editor @entity39 said in an e-mail			0
the @entity24 has become a sort of de facto repository for @entity11 's arrest statistics -- the site says he 's logged almost 6,000 collective days in jail , for instance -- and in september 2008 corrected a local television station that aired a report stating @entity11 had been arrested for the 1,000th time			1
not so , the site reported			0
@entity11 had been arrested 1,332 times as of august 31 , 2008			1
the station , it turned out , had n't accessed the records before 1992 , omitting 264 arrests in the 1970s and 1980s alone , @entity24 said			0
( full disclosure : @entity0 misreported the 1,000th arrest as well			2
) " we have literally been following @entity11 's arrest history ( and collecting his mug shots ) for more than a decade			1
we even devoted a page to him in our last book , " @entity39 wrote			0
" we have continued to monitor his arrests and the days he has been incarcerated as a result of those collars			2
" man about town @entity3 police and @entity27 jail officials say they ca n't confirm an exact number because their records go back to only 1992 ( @entity11 began his arrest career in 1970 ) , but @entity3 police spokeswoman @entity74 says @entity11 has " definitely " been in handcuffs more than 1,000 times			1
" it 's a weekly , if not every - two - or - three - days thing , " she said			1
" he 's never doing bad or illegal things purposely			2
... he 's just so highly intoxicated that he 's posing a danger to himself			2
" almost all of his arrests have been for alcohol intoxication , though there 's the occasional criminal trespass , @entity74 said			2
there have even been times when @entity11 was released from the @entity89 in the evening , only to return by midnight			2
one anecdote -- and there are many -- places a fresh - out - of - the - clink @entity11 in a sandwich shop near the @entity94 campus , telling jokes and dancing for change , wrote commenter @entity97 on @entity24 website			1
" we walked outside and he said he needed a place to go and looked around like he was looking for someone			0
next thing i know is that a cop drives by and @entity11 says , ' @entity105 ... here 's my ride ' and grabs someone 's drink and throws it at the cop car , " @entity97 wrote			1
lately , judges have started handing down harsher sentences , jail spokeswoman @entity111 said			0
she said some of @entity11 's sentences in recent years have lasted three months			1
he 's been arrested five times this year , she said			2
in the past , when his sentences were shorter , it was common for @entity11 to rack up dozens of arrests in a year , she said			1
" most people on the streets of @entity3 know who he is , " @entity111 said			0
a local band , the @entity123 , even wrote a song about him a few years back			0
the chorus goes , " so tell @entity11 i wan na be his girl / he 's the sanest guy in town and he can dance just like @entity18 / unlike the other boys around that made me cry			1
" glimmers of hope there have been signs that @entity11 might change his ways			1
in 2009 , he attended an alcohol - recovery program for about five months before falling off the wagon a few days shy of his graduation , said attorney @entity139 , who represented @entity11 three times in 2008 and 2009			1
@entity11 was en route to getting an apartment and food stamp benefits , so @entity139 was particularly disappointed when @entity11 snapped his spate of sobriety in april 2009			1
" he was telling me how sorry he was			0
he was actually in tears , " the lawyer recalled			0
@entity139 took up @entity11 's case pro bono after deciding that the town dipsomaniac was an easy target for police officers looking for a quick collar			1
" he just gets in the car in his handcuffs and rides , " @entity139 said of @entity11 , adding that when @entity11 gets in front of a judge , " he pleads guilty in five minutes			1
" @entity11 , who began drinking in his teens when his adoptive mother died , may have a " fear of being sober , " @entity139 said			1
several people have tried to help him , including @entity27 district court judge @entity163 , who allowed him to go to rehab in 2009 even though the statute calls for 90 days in jail			2
" she gave us a lot of leeway to work with @entity11			2
a lot of his successes in the past are due to her giving him chances in the first place , " the attorney said			0
" most judges are thoughtful about how wasteful it is to put someone away for 90 days for being drunk			0
" despite that @entity11 lists no one as next of kin in his booking records -- and @entity139 said the only family of which he is aware lives in @entity185 , about 13 miles north of @entity3 -- @entity11 once declined an offer to relocate to @entity187 so he could get away from the elements that draw him back to drinking			2
he likes @entity3 and does n't want to leave			0
" the good thing is , he knows where stuff is			0
the bad thing is , he knows where stuff is , " @entity139 said			0
sobriety on horizon ? the attorney is holding out hope for a " @entity6 miracle , " though : seeing @entity11 kick the booze habit for good			1
he 's not the only one			0
@entity202 , co-founder of @entity3 's @entity203 , said she considers the " very pleasant " @entity11 a friend			1
he occasionally drops by the center for a bed or a bite to eat , but he 's " pretty independent , " she said			0
" you ca n't help but love him , i tell you			0
... he 's as honest as the day is long , " she said			0
" with @entity11 , you 're going to hear the truth			2
" she said wednesday that she might give @entity211 a call and offer to house him at the all - volunteer nonprofit center , where putting a roof over his head will cost $ 2.50 a night rather than the $ 80 a day the jail costs taxpayers			0
but , she concedes , " until someone is sick and tired of being sick and tired , it 's not going to work			0
" the center 's staff was " within an inch " of getting him on the right path last year , but @entity11 told her , with a trademark smile on his face , " i 'm not ready , " she said			1
maybe this year , it 'll take			0
" i do n't think it 's going to take many more winters , and this one may be the one , " @entity227 said			0
" there 's never going to be a time when i 'm not going to find something , even if it 's one of our couches , for @entity11			1

@entity11 will go before a judge thursday for his latest alcohol - related arrest
the local celebrity goes by " @entity18 " because he dances for change for drinks
police estimate they arrest him once a week , if not every two or three days
he 's stayed sober for months before ; lawyer hopes sobriety sticks this year
