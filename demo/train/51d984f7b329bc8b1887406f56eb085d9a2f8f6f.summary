-- note to self : when soliciting for drugs on @entity3 , try a direct message			1
facing another boring day at work , a @entity6 car repair shop worker decided some weed would be just the thing to make the day fly by			1
instead of reaching out by phone or walking to his friendly neighborhood drug dealer , the user , using the handle @ @entity14 , tweeted that he needed a joint delivered to his workplace in @entity16 , just north of @entity6			1
opinions on marijuana reaching tipping point the @entity20 , @ @entity21 , caught a whiff of the request and enthusiastically -- perhaps too enthusiastically -- responded with , " @entity24 ! can we come too ? " you can imagine what happens next			1
the police forwarded the tweet to an account for a man listed on the board of directors for the repair shop chain			1
but it did n't end there			2
when oversharing online can get you arrested the exchange was retweeted thousands of times			2
at one point it was a top trend in @entity6 that tuesday			2
the tweeter then tried a couple of different tactics			2
" @entity44 knew weed smokers are more wanted in society than shooters & rapists			1
big smh to all of y'all , " said one tweet			2
" people really think i 'm serious with my tweets ? @entity55			0
" ca n't lie , stupid move but would y'all have noticed that tweet if @entity21 did n't retweet it ? " since the tweeter named the company , mr. lube , and the intersection where his shop was , the chain got involved			0
" thank you to the @entity20 for your help and great work			0
the matter has now been handled , " it said in a tweet			0
handled ? " just got the call of termination , " tweeted the worker later that afternoon			0
make that , the ex-worker			0
@entity78 broadcaster @entity76 reached out to the manager of the repair shop , who said " there was an employee here by that name ; he no longer works for us			0
" the @entity20 explained in a later tweet , " if you shouted on a busy street corner about illegal activity & we drove by , we 'd intervene			0
think of @entity3 as a virtual street corner			1
" and one final volley from the social media - savvy department			1
" at the end an interesting day , a reminder to our tweeps : the @entity94 is a public forum # tweetsafe # tweetclassy # imagineyourmamareadingit " lesson learned ? probably			0
the next day , the man deleted his account			1
@entity0 's @entity102 contributed to this report			0
