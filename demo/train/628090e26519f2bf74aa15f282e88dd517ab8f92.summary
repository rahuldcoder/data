yes , like those other great combinations , there 's something about a photo of @entity12 complemented by a caption in the forceful sans - serif font that -- to borrow from @entity15 , who most assuredly was not talking about the subject -- just works			1
oh , you know what i 'm talking about			0
every time you open @entity24 , every time you check @entity26 , there they are : photos of newsmakers and animals , @entity29 and @entity30 , accompanied by a few sardonic words in glorious , white - on - black , lightly bordered @entity7			1
well , why impact ? why not arial or @entity32 or @entity33 ? how did this particular typeface become the default ? part of it is simple convenience , says @entity39 , a professor at @entity40 who studies social media			1
impact , which was initially created in 1965 , was one of the fonts included in early @entity46 operating systems			1
in those kludgy 1990s days , @entity47 only included a relative handful of typefaces , and @entity7 was " the big , bold font people had , by default , in their @entity46 computers , " says @entity39			1
given the dominance of @entity46 systems and the freeware @entity47 included -- @entity56 and the like -- it was a typeface shared by millions of @entity46 users at a time @entity46 had more than 90 % of the pc market			1
moreover , adds design consultant @entity59 of the @entity61 - based @entity60 , it was " web - safe , " compatible across the then - young @entity63			1
@entity47 had a set of " core fonts , " which also included @entity67 , @entity68 and the much - derided @entity69 , which would look similar regardless of the computer you were using			1
all of these details led to @entity7 's widespread use			1
boosting impact it was n't long before image macros -- the graphic jokes initially passed around on bulletin boards or on e-mail -- started incorporating @entity7			1
@entity80 , founder of the @entity80 humor site , which @entity83 credits for coining the term " image macro , " remembers a distinct progression to the current look			1
" originally , people would just post images and then , in the forums , type the text beneath it ( usually because they did n't have @entity94 ) , " he says via e-mail			0
" after more and more people started obtaining @entity94 is when the image macros really began			1
" that was in 2000			0
initially , image macro creators used @entity100 or @entity69 ( " usually to insult another poster directly , " says @entity80 ) but at some point impact came into play			1
" i believe the first time the font face changed to @entity7 was when somebody posted an image of a very obese black woman wearing a spandex superhero outfit , and the text just said ' @entity111			1
' after that , everybody seemed to use impact , " says @entity80			1
fast - forward to 2007			1
software developer @entity116 was having a bad day and put out a request for funny photos			0
in response , a friend sent him a picture of a goofy cat from a @entity125 cat food commercial that had been making the rounds since at least 2003			2
the caption , in @entity7 , read , " i can has cheezburger ? " that photo started the @entity130 empire -- and probably helped cement the usage of @entity7 , says @entity116 , who has since moved on to other projects as an adviser			0
( @entity134 now owns @entity130			0
) " when i did cheezburger , i 'm sure we helped @entity7 's case , " he says			2
it was n't just the sheer popularity of that single meme , he says , though that did n't hurt			0
it was also by showing what did n't work			0
@entity116 mentions that he followed @entity130 with @entity143 , intended to be the dog version of the cat - centric cheezburger			2
@entity146 initially used a wider font -- and was n't as successful			2
( of course , it also could have been the dogs			0
) on the other hand , @entity150 , devoted to images of poor signage and general obliviousness , routinely used the word " fail " in all - caps impact -- and worked			1
" there are all these little nuanced things , " says @entity116			0
" and it 's interesting how each meme has a certain look and feel			2
it all has to work			0
when we see a funny joke , there are millions of ( others ) that have died			0
" ' it 's like overkill ' why @entity7 works is a debatable question , but the @entity60 's @entity59 points out that typefaces are n't neutral			2
they have personalities , he says			0
sometimes they 're obvious : the rounded , bulbous font used by @entity174 suggests cheerfulness ( and doughnuts ) , for example			2
@entity69 , as @entity179 owner @entity178 learned to his dismay , signifies cutesiness ( at best )			0
on the other hand , @entity182 is a subtle font , often used by brands " to make them feel like they are the standard - bearer of simple , " says @entity59			1
@entity7 , on its face , suggests boldness , loudness and yelling , especially in all - caps -- " it 's like overkill , " says @entity195 , a graphic design professor at the @entity196			1
combine that with photos of cats or @entity29 , and the contrast provokes at least a smile			0
( indeed , @entity7 is even more effective with a 1 - pixel outline or drop shadow , says @entity116			2
) the look has now become an established template , with such sites as @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 making such memes automatic			2
just find an image , add a punchy phrase in @entity7 and you 're there			2
the look helps us recognize the whole package as a meme , says @entity40 's @entity39			2
it 's a shorthand for comedy , which is useful , because the impact -- pardon the pun -- is ephemeral , he adds			1
" memes are about being in the moment , " he says			0
" making a meme has to be fast and has to be pertinent			0
" whether @entity7 lasts for memes is anybody 's guess			1
@entity59 observes that the requirements that once made it obligatory -- its convenience and commonality -- are fading , now that anybody with a font editing application can create their very own looks			0
his own company has created several fonts that have the same metrics as @entity7			0
but , for now , it 's not going anywhere			0
" for the most part the template will stick , " says @entity39			0
" there will certainly be new types of memes and there will certainly be new templates that will come from new apps that make image - sharing easier			1
but i think what most people are looking for is the content and the context , so the meme template is going to prevail for some time			0

most image memes use the font impact
impact was one of @entity46 ' " web - safe " fonts , easily *accessed* in @entity63 's early days
its forcefulness gives irony to goofy pictures , provides instant comedy
