-- the jarring sounds of war have longed echoed over @entity3			1
now it 's time for music to rock the @entity7 capital			1
armed with powerful songs and bold lyrics , a daring group of hip - hop musicians has defied death threats and violent attacks from militant extremists to spread its message of peace in war - torn @entity3			1
@entity17 , a popular collective of @entity7 refugee musicians based in @entity20 , traveled to the coastal city to stage the @entity17 , expected to be the country 's biggest music event since the eruption of a vicious civil war in 1991			1
" through this tour and our music we are trying to pass the @entity7 people a message to stop the killing , to stop the dying , because , there is no need for all these people dying for nothing , " says @entity26 , lead singer and manager of @entity17 , a group famous for its lyrics attacking @entity7 warlords			1
" we want to finish this war for good			0
" ' we will continue ' @entity17 , whose name translates as " new era , " was formed in 2004 , featuring the talents of a revolving collective of exiled rappers and singers who moved to neighboring @entity20 to escape the horrors of @entity51 's conflict			1
led by @entity26 and fellow singer @entity17 , who are now married , the group 's energetic rap and soulful r&b struck a chord with the youth in @entity57			1
from their makeshift studio in @entity60 , they first tasted success with songs touching on themes such as love , poverty and human rights			0
yet as the crisis in their homeland deepened , @entity17 's lyrics soon broke into more dangerous territory			1
" shocked shocked / who is behind this trail of destruction ? / @entity80 is / they galvanize people on the street for their wicked cause / they profess to be pious but they wield machetes , " raps @entity26 in @entity7 on " @entity71 " ( reject the @entity72 ) , one of the group 's most popular songs			1
@entity80 was once the armed wing of the @entity86 , which took over most of southern @entity51 in the second half of 2006			0
as it expanded its reach in the @entity57 country , the @entity89 - linked insurgent group started implementing cruel punishments for behavior it deemed un-islamic : women were stoned to death for adultery , amputations and beheadings became common , while in some areas @entity80 banned listening to the radio			2
read this : @entity7 women defy danger to write history popular musicians were also a target ; @entity17 , which had caused a stir by having women dance on stage and in its videos , received several threats and was ordered to stop making music			1
" they sent us a lot of threatening messages and also phone calls , " recalls @entity26 , who is from the town of @entity114			0
" they were saying , ' you are doing propaganda for anti-islam or anti-jihad , so we will finish you , ' " he adds			0
and that 's what they tried to do			0
in late 2007 , militants broke into @entity26 's @entity60 house and shot him several times			0
the rapper , who managed to escape , took five bullets and suffered internal organ injuries , as well as an arm wound			0
since then , several more incidents have followed , with radical militants threatening members of the band and in some cases assaulting them			0
yet all these attacks have failed to deter @entity17			2
its members have continued risking their lives , remaining on the front line to promote their message for peace			0
" if we stop , i think these people will win , they will reach their aim , " says @entity26			0
" so if we continue , we are the winners because we need to tell our people that terrorism is not good , that killing people is not good , that suicide bombing is not good			0
" ' blow their minds with hop - hop ' @entity51 moved a step closer to stability last september after picking its first president elected on home soil in decades			2
following months of ironing out planning details and security arrangements , @entity17 is now set to put on an array of free concerts and other related artistic activities in @entity3 , with the support of local and international officials			1
read this : ' new hope for @entity51 ' joining them , fellow @entity7 musicians and performers from the @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity20 and other countries will unite their voices in a crescendo of " stealth events " that will pop up around @entity3 over the next few days			1
organizers say these events are designed to rally would - be fighters to peacefully resist extremism			1
music workshops and open mic events with at - risk youth and former militia will kick - start the proceedings , followed by a solidarity show featuring international musicians such as @entity170 - @entity169 folk singer @entity186 , @entity189 reggae fusion artist @entity187 and @entity191 soul singer @entity190			2
the event will culminate in the main @entity193 , headlined by @entity17 and featuring cameo appearances by other @entity7 and international performers			1
" it 's always been @entity17 's way to respond to violence in the community by pulling youth away from the fray and into a venue where they give them an open mic to share their feelings , and then blow their minds with @entity7 hip - hop about ending the war , " says @entity196 , the festival 's lead producer and founder of @entity199 , a group organizing music events promoting peace			1
" countering the terror groups and extremist rebels who use surprise bombings to destroy , these singers launch surprise flash mob concerts to bring back the message of love and peace , " he adds			0
for security reasons , each event will be held at a different venue , organizers say			2
the exact locations and times will only be revealed shortly before each event by phone or text message			2
even though insurgents have fled @entity3 and guns have largely fallen silent , security is still a risk -- at least 10 people were killed in the suicide bombing of a bus outside @entity3 's @entity241 on march 18			2
portions of @entity51 still remain lawless as large parts of the country are under the control of militants , such as @entity80			0
' @entity247 ' the festival in @entity3 is the latest event in @entity17 's tour aiming to win over youth and convince them to turn away from violence			1
starting with concerts in the @entity169 last summer , @entity17 then brought its @entity255 back to @entity57			2
true to their intrepid reputation and message of peace , the rappers staged a string of " stop - the - violence " surprise shows in one of @entity60 's toughest neighborhoods in november 2012 in response to a chain of blasts that had rocked the @entity20 capital			1
the group 's performances will be featured in " live from @entity3 , " a documentary following the band 's death - defying journey to bring modern live music back to their homeland			1
" i have worked and supported musicians also in @entity170 , @entity278 , @entity279 -- really , this group , they 're the most willing to risk their lives and really go straight against the extremism , " says @entity196 , who is also behind the documentary , set to be released later this year			2
" a lot of music and human rights projects around the world are just about being happy and love and stuff like that , but this one is much more specifically trying to persuade youth to make a better choice , " he adds			2
" they are risking their lives and being much more on the front line than any of the other musicians			0
" for @entity26 , the time is now right to take his music back to @entity51			0
" at this time , we need to start to reach the youth in @entity51 to pass our message , " he says			0
" we need to tell them that this jihad is not good , is not right , so this time i think in @entity51 most people do n't want the extreme ideas			0
i think this time it 's better than before			0
