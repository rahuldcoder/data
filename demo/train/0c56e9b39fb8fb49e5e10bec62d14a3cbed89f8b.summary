-- here 's some good news , a year after @entity2 : states have been restoring funds for mental health coverage			1
states are the main providers of mental health services			2
in the recession of 2008 - 2009 , the states together cut $ 1.8 billion from mental health budgets , according to the @entity10 , an advocacy group			0
over the past year , 36 states have added money back			1
@entity13 just legislated the largest increase in mental health coverage in the state 's history , $ 259 million more over the next two years than over the previous two			2
private dollars may soon flow , too : the @entity19 requires insurers to expand their coverage of mental health problems			0
states have passed laws intended to prevent the mentally ill from doing harm			1
@entity26 adopted the most sweeping legislation			0
the @entity28 , as it 's known , requires all mental health professionals to report patients who , in the professional 's opinion , seem likely to present a risk of serious harm to themselves or others			0
state police can then check these reports and deny or revoke a gun license			1
@entity39 and @entity40 have also stiffened mental health reporting requirements			0
now the sobering news : mental health professionals ca n't report dangerous people if they do n't come into contact with them in the first place			1
professionals are in short supply			0
insurance coverage has historically been thin			0
those who most need mental health help are precisely those least likely to seek or accept it			0
even if the dangerous mentally ill can be identified , the facilities to protect society have been reduced to desperate inadequacy			1
in 1959 , state mental hospitals housed about 559,000 patients			2
a generation later , the mental hospital population had dwindled to 70,000 people			2
this trend is called " deinstitutionalization , " but that 's an inapt term			0
the mentally ill do often end up inside institutions : prisons			1
almost 1.3 million mentally ill people are held in prisons and jails			1
few of these people are adequately treated , and they often emerge more troubled and dangerous			1
even if authorities can identify a potentially dangerous mentally ill person and do revoke that person 's gun license , the sheer superabundance of guns in the @entity71 puts weapons in easy reach of anyone who wants them			1
the guns that @entity81 used at @entity2 were bought by his mother , who could have passed any background check			2
a society with a lot of guns is going to have a lot of shootings , no matter what else it does for the mentally ill -- especially since the most common form of gun violence is not homicide but suicide			1
the self - slaughter of a chronically depressed person is a mental health failure , too			0
a stronger mental health system is not an alternative to gun safety laws			2
it must operate in tandem with them			0
that lesson was written in blood at @entity2 , yet it remains unlearned to this day			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity107 .			1

@entity107 : the good news , a year after @entity110 , is growing state spending on mentally ill
yet such *worthy* *efforts* wo n't stop some troubled people from gun violence , he says
@entity118 : superabundance of guns in the @entity71 puts weapons in easy reach
