the chief political commentator at the @entity2 has quit after describing the @entity5 newspaper 's lack of coverage of the @entity8 tax - dodging scandal as a " fraud on its readers			1
" @entity11 , who had been at the @entity13 - based broadsheet since 2010 , accused its executives of placing the interests of the bank -- a key advertiser -- above its duty to bring the story to its readers			1
he lamented the sharp fall in circulation and the arrival of a " click culture " at the newspaper , which meant stories were no longer judged by their importance , accuracy or appeal to those who actually bought it			0
" with the collapse in standards has come a most sinister development , " @entity11 wrote tuesday , in a rambling commentary published on opendemocracy.net			1
" it has long been axiomatic in quality @entity5 journalism that the advertising department and editorial should be kept rigorously apart			0
there is a great deal of evidence that , at the @entity2 , this distinction has collapsed			1
" he was referring to the recent " @entity8 files " case , where documents leaked to @entity47 authorities by a former @entity8 employee , and then analyzed by the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) accused the banking giant of using a secretive @entity52 banking system to conceal the identities of account holders , and in many cases , help them avoid paying tax			0
@entity11 pointed out that while the story was splashed across the front pages of its competitors for days , " you needed a microscope to find the @entity2 coverage			1
" " nothing on monday , six slim paragraphs at the bottom left of page two on tuesday , seven paragraphs deep in the business pages on wednesday , " he wrote			0
" @entity2 's reporting only looked up when the story turned into claims that there might be questions about the tax affairs of people connected to the @entity79			1
" the @entity2 is a politically conservative title , largely supportive of prime minister @entity82 's @entity81			1
shortly after @entity11 's blistering attack , the newspaper hit back			1
" it is a matter of huge regret that @entity11 , for nearly five years a contributor to the @entity2 , should have launched such an astonishing and unfounded attack , full of inaccuracy and innuendo , on his own paper			1
" an @entity8 spokesperson declined to comment on @entity11 's claims when contacted by @entity0 wednesday			1
@entity11 said this is n't the first time the newspaper had suppressed stories relating to @entity8			2
last year , he recalled working on a piece about how prominent @entity5 @entity99 had received letters out of the blue from @entity8 informing them that their accounts had been closed			0
" no reason was given , and it was made plain that there was no possibility of appeal , " he wrote			0
when he tried to publish the story , he described being " fobbed off " and given non-existent legal issues as an excuse			0
" when i pushed the point , an executive took me aside and said that ' there is a bit of an issue ' with @entity8			0
eventually i gave up in despair and offered the article to @entity117 , " he wrote			0
@entity11 said the reporting on @entity8 is part of a wider problem at the newspaper			2
he described the @entity2 's stance on last year 's pro-democracy protests in @entity124 as " bizarre			2
" when rivals including @entity126 and the @entity127 wrote in december about the refusal by the @entity130 government to allow a committee of @entity5 lawmakers into the former @entity5 colony , he said the @entity2 remained silent			2
in september that year , the newspaper published a commentary by the @entity130 ambassador to @entity5 to coincide with what @entity11 described as its " lucrative " @entity139 supplement			2
it was given the headline " let 's not allow @entity124 to come between us			0
" when he expressed his concern about the direction the paper was taking , @entity11 recalled a meeting with @entity149 , the chief executive of the @entity150			2
" i told him that i was not leaving to join another paper			0
i was resigning as a matter of conscience			0
" mr. @entity149 agreed that advertising was allowed to affect editorial , but was unapologetic , saying that ' it was not as bad as all that ' and adding that there was a long history of this sort of thing at the @entity2 , " wrote @entity11 .			1

@entity11 quits the @entity2 and accuses it of being more concerned with advertisers
@entity11 : " with the collapse in standards has come a most sinister development "
@entity2 calls it an " astonishing and unfounded attack , full of inaccuracy and innuendo "
