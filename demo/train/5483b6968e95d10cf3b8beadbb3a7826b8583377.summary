@entity13 's assertive style worked in the @entity59 , but it brought perils for diplomats in @entity23 and @entity22 , where long stretches of chatting and tea - drinking are the norm			1
he was frank in his assessments about the region and officials in both countries regarded him as abrasive , including @entity23 president @entity70			2

" " achieving peace and stabilization of a country with complex realities on the ground , as well as in the region , is not an overnight task , but there was no doubt that he was pursuing his mission not only objectively , professionally and patriotically as an @entity42 , but at the same time as a friend of @entity23 , " said dr. @entity93 , @entity23 's former foreign minister			1
" that was what we admired most			0
" in an interview with @entity1 , @entity22 president @entity98 called @entity13 an " extremely hard - working man " who can " get things done which would otherwise take weeks to get through			2

" few people have ever left a larger mark on the @entity133 or our country			0
" a statement appearing on numerous radical @entity138 websites used @entity13 's death to condemn the @entity42 military presence in @entity23			1
" people can not turn a blind eye to the presence of ( @entity42 and allied ) troops and can not be fooled by ( @entity146 , @entity13 and others who should know that their fate is a scandal , madness , fainting , or worse than that , " the statement read			1
shortly after taking office , @entity20 appointed @entity13 to the special representative job and @entity13 dove in headfirst to tackle the challenges			1
in an october interview with @entity1 , @entity13 cautioned patience in the struggle against the militants and for democracy in the so - called @entity162 region , a mission that he said was of the " most vital importance to our national security interests			0

he noted that dealing with so many foes on both sides of the @entity23 - @entity22 border made the process difficult			0
" a peace deal requires agreements , and you do n't make agreements with your friends , you make agreements with your enemies , " he said			0
@entity13 mentioned a range of militant groups , such as the @entity23 @entity109 , the @entity22 @entity109 , the @entity184 , and @entity185 , and noted that " an expert could add another 30			1
" " there 's no @entity188			0
there is a widely dispersed group of -- of people that we roughly call the enemy			0
there 's @entity110 , with which there 's no possibility of any discussion at all			0
