-- after all the comparisons to @entity4 , @entity2 's fate turned out very differently			1
@entity2 -- who also killed a black 17 - year - old and said he did it in self - defense -- now faces decades in prison after he shot into an suv full of teenagers during a spat over loud music			1
but this story is far from over			0
the prosecution wants another conviction			0
@entity2 could appeal the convictions he already has			1
and once again , the country is at odds about whether race led to a young man 's death			0
meanwhile , @entity2 's daughter told @entity27 's " @entity26 " that she 's barely stopped crying since the verdict was handed down and she struggles to imagine " life without him			1
" " i love him so much			0
he 's my best friend , " @entity29 tearfully said			0
" if he sees no other way than to bring out his gun , that 's what he 's going to do , " she said			0
both sides to keep fighting after 30 hours of deliberation , a @entity38 jury on saturday found @entity2 guilty of three counts of attempted murder as well as a count stemming from shooting into the teens ' vehicle			1
but jurors did n't convict him of murder for the death of 17 - year - old @entity48			1
state attorney @entity49 said prosecutors will seek a new trial in @entity52 on the murder charge			2
" justice for @entity48 is as important as it is for any victim , " said @entity54 , whose office also prosecuted @entity4 for the shooting death of @entity57			2
even without a murder conviction , @entity2 faces a lengthy prison term			1
each attempted second - degree murder conviction carries a minimum sentence of 20 years			1
there 's also a possible 15 - year sentence for the conviction on shooting into the teenagers ' vehicle			1
" you are looking basically at life in prison , " @entity2 's attorney @entity70 said			1
" at 47 years old , that 's a life sentence regardless of count one			2
" @entity70 said he would challenge the convictions and would consider asking for a change of venue			2
" for the retrial , i almost think we would have to , " the attorney said			0
" but again , i may not be the counsel at that point			0
we are a long ways away from that			0
" opinion : an empty verdict , a hollow victory analysts disagree criminal defense attorney @entity91 , who was not involved in @entity2 's case , said she thinks the case may have been another example of overcharging			1
" i think that there is an issue of overcharging because there 's always a question when you bring a charge that involves intent , " she told " @entity102 " on sunday			0
" and in this first - degree murder charge , it 's premeditation			2
when a jury has to look at -- did somebody plan ? was this strategic ? did they communicate this plan to somebody else ? that 's a situation where a jury could very easily get hung up on deciding , what was the person 's intention ? " but another attorney , @entity115 , said she did n't think @entity2 or @entity4 was overcharged			1
" what i do think is that the prosecution failed to give the jurors what they needed to know about that very intent , " @entity115 said			0
ten bullets over music on november 23 , 2012 , @entity2 pulled into a gas station in @entity125 and parked next to a red @entity126 full of teenagers			1
@entity2 did n't like the loud music -- " rap crap , " he called it -- coming from the teens ' suv			1
so he asked them to turn it down			0
what happened next depends on whom you believe			0
@entity2 claimed @entity48 threatened him , and he took matters into his own hands after seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the @entity126			1
but prosecutors said @entity2 lost control , firing three volleys of shots -- 10 bullets total -- at the suv over music he did n't like			1
the prosecution also challenged what @entity2 did next : he left the gas station and drove 40 miles to a bed and breakfast in @entity153			2
there , he walked his dog , ordered a pizza , then drank rum and cola			0
after learning almost six hours later that he had killed @entity48 , @entity2 testified that he became " crazy with grief , " experiencing stomach problems for about four hours before taking a nap			1
" my intent was to stop the attack , not necessarily end a life , " he testified			2
" it just worked out that way			0
" yet his fiancee , @entity48 , testified that @entity2 had never mentioned any weapon to her -- be it a shotgun , a stick , a barrel or a lead pipe			1
police found a basketball , basketball shoes , clothing , a camera tripod and cups inside the teenagers ' @entity126 , but no gun			0
and @entity2 never called police			2
the first contact he had with them was at his home in @entity185 -- 130 miles south of @entity153 -- as he was being apprehended			0
arguing that he was n't in a rational state of mind , @entity2 admitted , " it makes sense that i should have ( contacted authorities )			1
i ca n't tell you why			1
" ' a little bit of closure ' the lack of a murder conviction led protesters to march outside the @entity125 courthouse , calling for @entity54 to lose her job			0
but @entity48 ' mother , @entity200 , did n't express any anger when she spoke to reporters saturday			2
she said her family is " so very happy to have just a little bit of closure			0
" the verdict came the day before what would have been @entity48 ' 19th birthday			2
" it 's sad for mr. @entity2 that he will live the rest of his life in that sense of torment , and i will pray for him , " @entity200 said			2
" and i 've asked my family to pray for him			0
" @entity0 's @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .			0
