@entity3 fewer members of the military are being sexually assaulted and more victims are coming forward , the @entity0 said in a long - awaited report obtained by @entity4 on wednesday			1
but 4.3 percent of the @entity8 ' active - duty women still say they were the victims of unwanted sexual contact in the last year , and most still are n't reporting those assaults			1
some of those who did report their assaults faced retaliation , according to the @entity0 's findings			1
in the 136 - page report due to be publicly released thursday , the @entity0 said more victims are reporting sexual assaults			1
in 2012 , just 1 - in - 10 victims reported those assaults , and by 2014 , 1 - in - 4 did			1
the report pointed to a 50 percent increase in the number of victims who reported the assaults from 2012 to 2013 , and another 8 percent leap in 2014			1
the @entity0 said , " the importance of this upward trend in reporting can not be overstated			1
" " increased reporting signals not only growing trust of command and confidence in the response system , but serves as the gateway to provide more victims with support and to hold a greater number of offenders appropriately accountable , " the report said			2
defense secretary @entity39 , @entity41 chairman gen. @entity40 and gen. @entity42 , the director of the @entity0 's @entity43 and @entity44 , delivered the report to the @entity46 on tuesday			2
the report noted a major increase in reports of sexual assaults in recent years -- from 3,604 in 2012 to 5,518 in 2013 and then 5,983 in 2014 -- and said it 's " unlikely " the bump is happening because more crimes are taking place			1
" given the underreported nature of sexual assault , the department believes this increase in reporting is likely due to greater victim confidence in the response system , " the report said			2
the number of active - duty women who said they were victims of unwanted sexual contact in the last year was 4.3 percent in 2014 -- down from 6.1 percent in 2012 -- the report said , citing surveys from those two years			1
victims of sexual assault can file " restricted " reports , which allows them to access health services without launching investigations and legal proceedings , or " unrestricted " reports , which do trigger independent investigations			0
in 2014 , the @entity0 said , 19 percent of the victims who filed restricted reports later decided to make those reports unrestricted and pursue investigations -- the highest figure it has ever recorded			1
the report also included a survey of more than 150 military sexual assault survivors			0
it found that three - quarters said they 'd recommend that others report being assaulted -- and 90 percent said they were satisfied with the aid and legal counsel they received			2
" however , too many of these respondents indicated they perceived social and / or professional retaliation as a result of making a report , " the @entity0 said			2
that admission comes as lawmakers push for bigger changes to separate sexual assault prosecutions and court - martial proceedings from the military 's chain of command			0
@entity102 @entity101 sen. @entity100 is making a new push for that legislation			0
she 's seeking to have the proposal added into a defense spending authorization bill that 's set for a @entity46 vote in the coming days			0
" the military has not been able to demonstrate that they have made a difference and they need to be held to the scrutiny and that standard this year because throughout the last year we have continued to see evidence of how much farther we have to go to solve sexual assault in the military , " @entity100 said tuesday at a news conference with a bipartisan set of senators who are advocating for her proposal			0
among the @entity123 proponents is sen. @entity124 , the @entity125 @entity123 and likely 2016 presidential contender			0
" if you were in a corporation you would not report to your boss -- you would go to the police , " he said			0
" in the military it 's a little different but you still would n't want to go to your boss directly or you would n't want your boss to be making the decisions -- particularly if your boss was buddies with the perpetrator -- you would want people you do n't know outside the chain of command			0
" update : this story has been updated to include additional information .			0
