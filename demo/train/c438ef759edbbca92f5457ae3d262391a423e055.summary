@entity0 , @entity1 at least seven civilians died after shells slammed into a transit stop thursday in the volatile eastern @entity1 city of @entity7 , the latest notable attack in a months - long conflict that has seen plenty of bloodshed , blame - sharing and intermittent negotiations but few signs of easing			1
the fatalities are among at least 10 civilians killed total , in addition to 20 injured , in the shelling of four city districts in the past 24 hours , the @entity15 said on its website			1
@entity1 's state - run @entity25 news , citing the @entity7 government , reported eight dead and seven hospitalized in the bus stop attack alone			1
@entity7 has been a stronghold for separatists , who have been battling government forces for control of the @entity7 and @entity31 regions since the spring			2
" as of now , the situation remains difficult , " the city council said			0
and as has been the case with many incidents in the conflict , there was no universally accepted explanation of what happened or who was responsible			0
@entity42 's @entity41 demanded an investigation and criticized @entity1 for its shelling of @entity1 cities like @entity7 , which are controlled or at least full of @entity47 separatists			1
yet @entity1 's @entity48 blamed the rebels for the attack , saying it was launched from areas they control			1
the @entity53 , which has a monitoring mission in @entity1 , is among those trying to get to the bottom of it all			2
its deputy chief monitor , @entity58 , told reporters that an @entity53 patrol saw seven bodies near a vehicle that had been hit			0
and it 's not the only instance of violence in the area			2
" terrorists using multiple launch missile systems precisely destroy ( ed ) houses " in the @entity7 region cities of @entity73 and @entity74 , @entity25 reported , citing @entity7 regional police chief @entity68			1
rebels captured 16 wounded @entity1 soldiers after fighting at @entity7 's airport , @entity0 's military said , according to @entity25			1
negotiations are underway to secure their release			0
and the @entity53 , in an update posted wednesday , cited numerous instances of shelling in recent days , with two hospitals in separatist - held territory among the buildings affected			0
as @entity90 gen. @entity89 , @entity93 's supreme allied commander @entity91 , pointed out thursday : " violence has intensified and changed character in @entity1			1
" as has been true so often in recent months , the violence is happening around the same time as negotiations aimed at stopping it			0
the latest talks happened wednesday in @entity98 and included the foreign ministers of @entity1 and @entity42 , as well as @entity100 and @entity101			2
their official aim was to resolve the crisis by hammering out how to implement a peace deal that was agreed upon last year			0
after wednesday 's talks , the four foreign ministers condemned the continuing violence and called for the peace deal that was reached in @entity110 , @entity111 , last september to be respected			0
fighting in the @entity7 and @entity31 regions " has severely escalated causing the loss of many human lives including civilians			1
this must stop immediately and the regime of quiet must be restored , " the ministers said			0
they said " tangible progress " must be made on full implementation of the @entity110 pact ahead of a planned peace summit			0
the attack on the @entity7 trolley bus station obviously does n't help the situation			1
@entity42 's foreign ministry called it a " a crime against humanity ( and ) a great provocation aimed to undermine the efforts for the peaceful settlement of the crisis			0
" the unrest began in late 2013 , leading up to @entity135 's ouster last february of @entity137 president @entity136			0
@entity42 annexed the @entity138 a few weeks later , with fighting breaking out in april in two @entity1 regions bordering @entity42 -- @entity7 and @entity31			1
separatist leaders there declared independence from @entity1 and sided with @entity42			2
but how much was , and is , @entity144 involved in their campaign ? @entity1 's divide : two sides of a river it depends who you ask			1
officials in @entity144 have expressed sympathy for the separatists , but denied any outright military support			2
however , @entity1 and its allies have accused @entity42 of fomenting the rebellion by actively backing it			2
" it is clear that @entity42 has to stop supporting the separatists and respect international law , " said @entity159 gen. @entity158 -- chairman of the military committee for @entity93 , which does n't include @entity1 but is working to further its " military - to - military cooperation " with @entity0			1
on wednesday , @entity1 president @entity164 reasserted a claim that @entity42 sent troops across the border to support the rebels			1
" we have more than 9,000 @entity42 troops who -- so - called -- lost the way , crossing our @entity42 - @entity1 border , bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks , armed personnel carriers , and killing @entity1 civilians and attacking @entity1 troops , " @entity164 told @entity2			2
@entity42 foreign minister @entity178 , speaking in @entity144 before the @entity98 talks , responded to @entity1 's assertion with a firm denial -- much like other denials made by @entity42 officials in recent months over similar allegations of armed intervention			1
" as to the flow of troops and armaments , this is not the first time we hear something like that , " he said			0
" and each time i hear that i say , if you 're so confident about that , please present us with facts , but no one has been able to provide us with these facts			0
" journalist @entity197 reported from @entity0			0
@entity2 's @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 contributed to this report .			0
