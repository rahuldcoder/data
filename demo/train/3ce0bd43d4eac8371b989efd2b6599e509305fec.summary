@entity0 , @entity1 -- a few months ago i had the opportunity to say goodbye to @entity6			1
knowing her time was limited , @entity7 visited @entity9 , where i am stationed , to show her children where she spent much of her childhood			1
she had endless fond memories			1
her father and family had been stationed here with the @entity17			1
it was unclear whether she would be healthy enough to make the trip , but right before she came she wrote me , apologizing for being disorganized , and asked if we would have time to see her			1
the last time i had seen her was at her home in @entity26 , right after the campaign ended			2
much had changed between then and now			2
@entity6 brought her family down from @entity29 to the base in @entity31 , riding the public train , to meet us on the @entity17 base -- a base she remembered roller skating on as a child			1
we had lunch in the @entity39 , where we all ordered hamburgers , and began to catch up on life			2
she shared stories of what the @entity39 meant to her as a child and talked about how she always felt that she had an instant family around the @entity17			2
her children who came with her , @entity46 and @entity47 , were perfectly behaved , listening to their mother and talking about the @entity50 stars they had just bought			1
she agreed to tour my office , where she graciously met the other judge advocates general , allowed pictures to be taken with her , and spoke to everyone about her experiences in the @entity17			2
very much in character , she also took the opportunity to share some specific policy ideas she had to help military families			2
on a family vacation , toward the end of her life , she was still looking for ways to engage with anyone she could on ideas to improve the lives of others			2
when @entity69 and the two kids went on a tour of one of the ships , she stayed behind			2
walking up and down ladders and around a ship would have been too much for her weak body			2
so , i stayed with her in an air - conditioned car outside of the ship 's gate , and for an hour and a half we talked			2
we talked about everything , including what had happened during the campaign and what she had been going through afterward			0
i expressed my disappointment in them , and told her how deeply hurt those of us who put our lives into the causes they championed were by what happened			0
they were our heroes , my heroes , and we were let down			0
she told me her story , what she knew , what ate her up inside as well , but she was n't defensive			1
it was her life that had been turned upside down , but she let me have my closure			0
on this july day , she was as she only knew how to be , totally raw			0
she told me then that she did n't know how much more time she had			1
she feared most for her children , and what would happen to them when she was gone			1
how would they fare without a mother ? she wanted to see @entity105 get married and watch the kids grow up			1
she was frustrated that her ability to work on the causes she still cared deeply about ( there were many ) was hampered by her husband 's actions			0
she worried about the future			0
but she was humble , tested and gracious enough to know that life was n't always about what you wanted			1
she told me that she had come to believe life is n't valued by how many years we have on @entity119 , but rather by how many good years we have			1
and she wanted to live her life out , whatever little she had left , to the fullest			0
after visiting on base she took the kids shopping in @entity123 , and then we all went to a @entity9 baseball game that night			1
at the game we talked politics , ate ramen , laughed about memories of trekking through @entity130 in december and january together , and rooted for players in @entity9			1
she gave me advice for my career and excitedly explained to me the business model for her furniture store in @entity26			0
she stayed six innings before getting tired			0
we hugged , and she whispered to me that she was proud of me			0
then , for the last time , we said goodbye			1
what made @entity6 so special was how wonderfully human she was			1
she embodied in everything she did the entirety of the human experience			0
she was passionate , edgy , classy , beautiful , unvarnished and sometimes awkward			0
to many she was frustrating , tough , and stubborn			0
to many more she was inspirational , intellectual , loving , curious , optimistic and nurturing			0
yet there was so much beauty in her imperfection			0
and @entity144 fell in love with this beauty			0
much in her life was tragic , but she never let herself be a tragedy			0
despite the anger and sadness she felt from the challenges life brought her , she never stopped living life on her terms , and sharing her amazing life with us			0
thank you for all the good years , @entity6			1
we are more grateful than you could ever know , and we miss you already			0
