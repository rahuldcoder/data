-- if @entity2 and @entity3 got together in the lab to patch together a new outfit , it might look like this			0
meet the @entity7 , a new suit of high - tech armor named after the armor worn by the @entity12 legions			1
it 's made from a blend of lightweight , flexible materials and comes with @entity17 and @entity18 connectivity , a point - of - view camera , a microphone and 52 pressure sensors that send data to an external computer program			1
it 's built by an @entity26 company that had real - world warriors , not superheroes , in mind			1
the idea ? to let martial artists compete at full speed with weapons in much the way bare - fisted fighters currently do in mixed - martial arts competitions such as the @entity37			1
" we have been overwhelmed , " said @entity38 , ceo of @entity39 , referring to the response from martial artists who have seen the suits			2
" we literally have heard from hundreds and hundreds of people who have been practicing for 20 or 30 years in weapons - based arts who have had no true way to test their skills without seriously injuring someone , or worse			1
" the suit was developed over the course of four years by a team of martial artists and engineers with a digital - tech background			1
one of the developers is an armorer who helped build more than 2,500 suits of armor for the " @entity63 " movies			2
aside from its obvious role as protection , the suit 's key feature is a set of 52 impact sensors spaced throughout			1
when struck , those sensors transmit data , via @entity18 or @entity17 , telling a computer where , and how hard , the blow landed			2
" we know the damage that would have occurred to an unprotected competitor if they were n't wearing the suit , and we can display that in real time , " @entity38 said			0
the system would allow fighters in a competition to score points with each successful blow against their opponents while eliminating the guesswork sometimes involved with human judges			0
if this all sounds like something you 'd love to watch , @entity38 and his team hope you 're not alone			0
he said they 're currently in talks with several production companies about broadcasting a tournament of weapons masters using the suits			2
he said the event most likely will occur late this year or in early 2015			2
" you look at the popularity of combat sports in video games -- the public loves seeing people fight with weapons , " he said			0
" we can throw a samurai master against a @entity110 @entity109 staff master and see who comes out on top			0
" the @entity7 suits that the company currently showcases online are elaborate prototypes			0
@entity38 would n't put a price on the current suits but said ultimately they 'd like to offer a simplified , and less expensive , version for sale to the public			0
@entity39 's patent for the suit also lists law - enforcement and military uses , though @entity38 says he does n't expect to ever see soldiers storming the barricades in his armor			1
" it 's about them using that technology in a training environment , " he said			0
" it 's not something to wear out as riot gear -- there 's plenty of stuff out there already			0
this is about teaching them at full speed how to respond to a weapons - based attack			1

@entity39 has developed a high - tech suit of armor
@entity26 company says it 's for weapons - based martial arts
