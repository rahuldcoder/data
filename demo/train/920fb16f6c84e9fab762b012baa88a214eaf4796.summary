@entity1 , @entity0 -- the battle over @entity0 ' attempts to change its law on abortion ran well into the night at the state capitol in @entity1 , with thousands milling around , all wanting to be heard during a public hearing			1
people representing both sides of the issue signed up to testify tuesday at a @entity15 meeting on @entity16 , a bill that would impose strict new regulations on abortions in the state			1
the measure seeks to ban abortions past 20 weeks of gestation , mandate abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers , and require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they 're providing abortion services			1
critics said the measure would shut down most abortion clinics in @entity0 , denying access to many , while proponents say it will raise the standard of care for women in @entity0			1
it was a heated night and middle ground was hard to come by			0
anti-abortion activists , all wearing blue shirts , joined together in shared prayer , telling stories of how abortions destroy lives			2
" in 1979 i paid a registered physician $ 300 to kill my second child			0
i hated myself it almost destroyed me , " @entity52 said			0
@entity0 governor says ' no mob rule ' in @entity56 on abortion nearby , abortion rights activists , dressed in orange , tried to drown out their opponents with drumming , cheering , and chanting slogans about personal liberty			1
the opinions of many were summed up by a young woman who yelled , " i 'm ( expletive ) tired of men trying to tell me what i can and can not do with my body ! " the initial @entity15 bill failed last week after a day and night of drama in which state sen. @entity72 , @entity73 , talked for more than 10 hours in an attempt to run out the clock on the legislative session			1
but gov. @entity78 called a special session so the legislature could take up the measure again			0
can @entity78 overcome last presidential run ? almost 2,000 people signed up to speak for three minutes , but by the end of the night , fewer than 100 were able to share their thoughts with the committee			1
registered nurse @entity87 , who works at a pregnancy crisis center , said she supports the measure			2
" i have been there on the front lines with the woman we are talking about today , " she said			0
" i am pro-choice , and i am pro-woman			0
i am pro-woman getting the kind of abortion care that is the finest care she can get			2
i support this bill because of what it will do to improve medical standards			0
" @entity101 arrived at the capitol at 8 a.m. and finally got her chance to speak at 6:45 p.m. " @entity105 , we need the separation of church and state , " she said			1
" i do n't believe in abortion but it is legal and as such all women deserve equal access			0
" the room used by the @entity15 filled almost immediately , and most people watched the proceedings in nine other rooms			1
one man who had been waiting to speak against the bill for hours angrily stormed out of the committee room when testimony was closed			2
" my grandmother died from a back alley abortion ! " he shouted			0
many abortions rights activists fear the legislation would restrict access to safe abortions and make women turn to more dangerous methods			0
outside of the hearing room in an outdoor courtyard , it was prayer circles versus drum circles for more than eight hours			0
at the end of the night , with more than 1,000 people still waiting to testify , the bill cleared the committee with an 8 - 3 vote			1
the @entity137 must now vote on the version of the bill in one of its committees before both bills can be brought to the @entity15 and @entity137 floors			1
a final vote is expected next week			0
opinion : the truth about the @entity0 filibuster and abortion			2
