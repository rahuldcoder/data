-- a @entity3 sex offender suspected of abducting a girl in 1991 and keeping her captive for 18 years is suffering from " serious mental illness , " defense attorneys say in court papers			1
" it appears that @entity11 has been hearing [ the ] voices of angels for years , " said documents filed wednesday in @entity9			1
the court papers dispute prosecutors ' asserting that @entity16 is a " master manipulator " who is still trying to influence his victim			1
@entity16 , 58 , and his wife , @entity20 , are charged with 29 felony counts in the kidnapping of @entity11 , who was 11 when she was snatched from the street in front of her house in @entity27 , @entity3			1
she was 29 when found in august at the @entity29 ' home in @entity30 , about 120 miles from her home			0
prosecutors allege that @entity16 fathered two daughters with @entity34 during her captivity			1
both @entity11 , who was a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest in august , and @entity11 have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them			1
in a filing earlier this month , prosecutors called @entity16 a " master manipulator , " citing journal entries made by @entity34			1
they also said @entity16 's attorneys were attempting to contact @entity34 , whose location they are trying to keep secret , and asked the court to impose a protective order barring such contact			1
a judge refused to immediately grant the request , setting a hearing for friday			0
@entity16 's public defenders , @entity56 and @entity57 , said @entity34 , who is identified in court papers as @entity59 , told investigators following @entity16 's arrest that he had a " self - described ability to understand the voices of angels			1
... one of the children disclosed this as well , describing how the voices would keep him up at night , and how the angels lived underground and spoke to him from this location			2
" the filing points to @entity16 's " manifesto , " entitled " @entity74 , " which he prepared in the days and weeks before his arrest and addressed to the @entity76			2
he took it " from law enforcement agency to law enforcement agency , calling attention to himself in a way that could [ and ultimately did ] lead to his arrest , " the attorneys said			0
@entity16 went to the campus of the @entity87 , accompanied by his two daughters with @entity34 , to get a permit to stage a demonstration of his ability , the documents said			1
university employees brought about his arrest after contacting his parole officer , saying they thought @entity16 's behavior was odd			2
" mr. @entity16 's illness was not subtle at all , " the documents said			2
" obviously the campus police at the @entity87 , @entity96 were able to perceive the clear signs of mental illness and took some action instead of ignoring them			0
" prosecutors , the defense said , have discussed the " cover stories " told by @entity34 and the children when @entity16 was summoned to the parole office the following day and questioned			1
authorities maintain such lies were evidence of @entity16 's manipulation , according to the documents			2
" in reality , it appears that everyone was very frightened by what could happen			0
they were afraid they would be separated and lose each other , " the defense said			0
" even the children made up stories ; there was a sense of panic			0
they were trying to protect each other			0
one of the children was so nervous she got sick			0
" asked several times who was the father of the children , @entity16 told several different stories , his attorneys said			2
" the agent 's report is helpful in showing how manipulative mr. @entity16 is not			2
" further evidence of @entity16 's mental illness is his repeated contact with the news media , according to his attorneys			2
" contacting the media against the advice of counsel when one is facing criminal charges as serious as these shows an inability to cooperate with counsel and an inability to appreciate the function of the criminal justice system , " the attorneys said			0
" in short , mr. @entity16 's contacts with the media , when his attorney tells him not to have them , are not manipulations at all , but evidence that he may not be competent to be a defendant			0
" @entity16 believes that @entity34 is part of his " transformation " and his " disclosure , " the documents said			1
" mr. @entity16 believes that he and @entity59 once had a plan to launch a web site wherein mr. @entity16 's ability to speak to angels would be revealed to mankind			1
he remains confused as to why that has not happened			0
" the attorneys said they had not attempted to contact @entity34 , but sent a letter to her former attorney without knowing he was no longer representing her			0
prosecutors said a sentence in that letter , conveying that @entity16 harbored no ill will toward @entity34 or the children and " loves them very much , " was interpreted as a manipulation attempt			1
defense attorneys maintained it was not			0
" there has been no intimidation or harassment of any kind , " they wrote			0
authorities maintain @entity34 does not want to speak to @entity16 or his attorneys			1
she has that right , the defense attorneys said , and the court can refuse to disclose her location			0
" however , in a case like this , it would make settlement far more difficult if counsel were forever foreclosed from approaching the idea of contact again , " the attorneys said			0
if the court will not disclose @entity34 's location , they requested a representative be appointed for communication purposes .			1

defense says @entity11 is mentally ill , hears angels ' voices
court papers filed in *response* to allegation that he still is trying to manipulate victim
@entity16 is accused of abducting @entity11 , holding her for 18 years
@entity34 , abducted at age 11 , was freed last summer
