@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 has temporarily suspended its chapter of the @entity6 after learning about a hazing incident involving fraternity members , a university spokeswoman said			1
university president @entity9 , in an e-mail to students , called it a " serious physical hazing incident			1
" @entity4 authorities learned about the incident on saturday , school spokeswoman @entity14 said tuesday			0
" we believe the incident took place several weeks prior , " she said			1
" the hazing incident is currently under investigation with the @entity4 police			1
" @entity23 , @entity1 's vice president for student affairs , said , " this was not a case that we know of that anyone went to the hospital -- thank goodness			1
" " it 's not in the realm of seriousness on the far end of things , when you think about what could have occurred with hazing , and we want to stop it now , " @entity23 told @entity2			0
when contacted by @entity2 , @entity6 referred all questions to the university			1
later wednesday , a statement released by the executive director of @entity6 said it issued a cease - and - desist order against the local chapter and will investigate the incident cited by the university and cooperate with police on any criminal investigation that may occur			1
" we recognize that hazing is a persistent social scourge that has proven time and time again to be difficult to eradicate and too dangerous to tolerate , " the statement said			0
" @entity6 does not condone hazing ! @entity6 has embraced programs , which provide leadership tools to recognize , prevent and address hazing			1
" the statement concluded with declarations in capital letters : " we can not say this enough : @entity58 is dangerous and @entity59 and must stop ! @entity6 has no place in its membership for the violence and brutality that accompanies hazing			1
@entity58 is illegal ! " the historically black fraternity dates back to 1906 , when it was founded at @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68			0
according to its website , @entity6 " has a zero tolerance level in regards to hazing / pledging and strongly prohibits these illegal activities in any form			1
" the alleged hazing incident happened off campus , according to @entity9 's e-mail to students , obtained by @entity2			1
" as that investigation proceeds , i want to reinforce the university 's prohibition against all forms of hazing -- and ask each of you to help us guard against this dangerous and destructive behavior , " @entity9 wrote			2
" @entity58 is specifically prohibited by @entity4 regulations , and it is also classified as a crime in @entity1			2
we can not tolerate hazing on our campus or in our university community , and anyone found responsible will face the gravest possible consequences , including expulsion and criminal penalties			1
" @entity9 did not provide any specifics about the incident , and he urged anyone who has experienced or witnessed any hazing incidents to contact campus police			1
@entity23 said there had been no previous reports of hazing incidents involving the fraternity			2
the @entity1 chapter has only a small organization at the university and no house , he said			1
an e-mail from the university 's @entity113 sent to the university 's fraternity and sorority members said @entity6 would be placed " on interim suspension pending the outcome of a formal hearing			1
" " @entity6 has been a strong member of the @entity123 for many years , " the e-mail stated			2
" while we are all disappointed to learn of such allegations , we all need to respectfully allow our @entity127 conduct process to take place before making decisions or speculations of the fraternity 's responsibility in this matter			0
we will share information with the community as and when that is appropriate			0
" the incident comes less than a month after four students at @entity139 were arrested after the hazing - related death of the school 's drum major in november			2
@entity145 's death prompted @entity139 's board of trustees to approve a three - part plan to tackle the issue of hazing on campus , including an independent investigation panel			2
@entity139 is located in @entity152			0
the @entity139 incident prompted @entity1 gov. @entity154 to order all state universities to examine their hazing and harassment policies in december			1
@entity154 also asked all university presidents to remind their students , faculty and staff " how detrimental hazing can be			2
" @entity23 said @entity4 authorities have worked for some time to eliminate hazing , and there has been a " heightened concern " since the death at @entity139			0
" i would like to stress this is not the norm for us , and we want to educate all our students that the world has changed -- do n't allow anyone to do this to you , " he said			0
however , students at the university said hazing still occurs at fraternities and sororities			2
" you know fraternities are still going to do this			0
it 's part of their culture , its imbedded in what they do in their initiation process and it 's still wrong , " said sophomore @entity183			0
" you ca n't escape it			0
" @entity193 , also a sophomore , said hazing has become a cyclical activity			0
" i know a lot of fraternity brothers who would say that why they do it is because it was done to them , " @entity193 said			0
" and people who get hazed , for now ( it ) kind of sucks , but they are going to do it to the ones that come in later on , and i feel that should not be part of the initiation process for becoming a brother or sister			0
" @entity2 's @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
