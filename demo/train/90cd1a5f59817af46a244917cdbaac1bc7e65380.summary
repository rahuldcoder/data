" this national unity is the only way to get @entity5 out of this difficult crisis , " @entity2 said in a nationally televised speech			1
the longtime @entity14 member paid special tribute to those " martyrs " who helped spearhead the revolution that led to the ouster of @entity5 's longtime president @entity20 and , more than a year later , to @entity2 's election			1
@entity2 's top challenges he expressed thanks and admiration for military personnel , police officers , judges and others in the @entity5 government for their work on behalf of the nation			1
" i must salute them because they have a role in the future " of @entity5 , @entity2 said			1
the president - elect also promised " we will preserve all national and international agreements , " a topic of concern in light of questions about how his election might affect @entity5 's ties with neighboring @entity46			1
and he vowed to " protect the rights of women and children , " as well as @entity50 and @entity51 alike			0
earlier in the day , election officials announced @entity2 earned more than 13 million votes in last week 's presidential election , while @entity55 -- the last prime minister to serve under @entity20 -- had more than 12 million			1
that worked out to just under 52 % of the vote for @entity2 , while @entity55 got just over 48 % , officials said			1
the announcement triggered massive cheers and celebratory gunfire in @entity0 's @entity62 , the hub of last year 's revolution , with temperatures near 100 degrees @entity66 ) failing to subdue the joy felt by @entity2 's supporters			1
similar rallies erupted sunday in @entity70 as well			0
" we 've been waiting for it for 7,000 years , " said @entity71 , a member of the @entity14 's @entity72			1
" for the first time in history , we have our own president , elected by us			0
the power of the people is now in the hands of the president -- and the president has to go and move forward			2
" added another man celebrating in @entity62 , " what we are happy for is @entity5 people could overcome the remnants of the last regime			1
" are you there ? share your images yet some @entity55 supporters were crushed by the news			2

" i hope we see a better future " @entity2 , she said , adding , " i highly doubt it			2
" @entity5 does not have a constitution , while military rulers dissolved parliament in the wake of a controversial and pivotal court ruling earlier this month			2
moreover , the presidency as currently defined is largely a figurehead position as the @entity111 ( @entity111 ) maintains much of the control over the country , as it has since @entity20 's exit			1
for this reason , a young @entity5 man named @entity116 dismissed the importance of the presidential vote			0
" ( @entity2 ) does n't have the power -- @entity111 has the power , " he said			0
yet @entity2 , who resigned from the @entity14 and its @entity72 shortly after the results were announced in an apparent effort to send a message that he will represent all @entity5 , said late sunday that he is " in charge " thanks to the vote , while stressing he must answer to the people			1
" we are all equal in rights , and we all have obligations to carry on for this country , " he said			0
" as for myself , i have no rights , but i have obligations			0
" like @entity20 , @entity55 is a former air force officer with close ties to @entity5 's powerful military and was " the quintessential candidate of the counterrevolution , " said @entity139 , a visiting fellow at the @entity140 in @entity141			1
@entity2 , an @entity149 - educated engineer , " represents the older , more conservative wing of the @entity14 and openly endorses a strict @entity148 vision , " said @entity142 of the @entity143 -- a view @entity2 seemed to try to rebut in his speech sunday			1
both presidential candidates claim victory in @entity5 among others , his victory raised questions about how it might affect @entity5 's relations with @entity46			2
@entity2 did n't directly address @entity46 on sunday , though he did promise to maintain " agreements			0
" he previously told @entity1 he 'd honor @entity5 's 1979 accord with @entity46 but in the past , the @entity99 figure has referred to @entity46 leaders as " vampires			2
" @entity46 prime minister @entity163 , in a statement sunday , said , " @entity46 appreciates the democratic process in @entity5 and respects the results of the presidential elections			0
@entity46 looks forward to continuing cooperation with the @entity5 government on the basis of the peace treaty between the two countries , which is a joint interest of both peoples and contributes to regional stability			0

the results were expected to be announced earlier in the week , but were pushed back to sunday			0

afterward , leaders from the country , region and world sent in their congratulations			0
they included @entity5 's grand mufti @entity204 and the head of the @entity207 religious authority @entity208 , who both congratulated @entity2 , according to state - run media			1

others described @entity2 's election as momentous but stressed that it does n't mean the county 's " revolution " or its problems are over			2

more than 1,800 ambulances were dispatched across the county before the announcement in anticipation of election - related violence , the state - run @entity255 agency reported			0
and even after @entity2 's win , the political situation remains very much unsettled amid lingering questions about whether the military will loosen its grip on power			1
under an interim constitutional declaration , the military council said it retains the power to make laws and budget decisions until a new constitution is written and a new parliament is elected			0
the declaration said @entity111 members " shall decide all matters related to military affairs , including the appointment of its leaders			0
