-- airstrikes against @entity3 militants are a " psychological operation , " not a military one , @entity6 president @entity5 told @entity0 's @entity7 in an interview that aired friday			1
" it is a common threat for all of us , " he said			0
" and this requires a unison effort from all of us			0
" " we need a vast campaign of operations ... the aerial bombardment campaign is mostly , i would say , a form of theater , rather than a serious battle against terrorism			0
" @entity22 and the @entity23 have found their foreign policies surprisingly aligned in the past several months , as both try to beat back the advance of the @entity29 extremists that have gained a foothold in @entity32 and war - torn @entity34			1
while the @entity23 has limited itself thus far to airstrikes in those two countries , @entity22 has sent @entity38 units into @entity32 ; the head of the @entity38 's @entity40 , @entity41 , has even been photographed on the ground in @entity32			1
five @entity44 countries , traditional adversaries of @entity22 , joined with the @entity23 in a rare coalition to strike @entity3 in @entity34			1
however , @entity5 said he 'd like to distance himself " from the word ' coalition ' because some countries have n't come together under the umbrella of this coalition			1
" the question of @entity34 many of the countries participating in the coalition have long pushed for the ouster of @entity34 strongman @entity55 , as the emir of @entity57 told @entity7 on thursday in his first - ever interview			1
@entity22 , on the other hand , is @entity55 's most fervent backer ; most military analysts agree that the regime would have fallen long ago were it not for @entity22 's 2012 intervention in the conflict			1
" how do you feel , " @entity7 asked @entity5 , " as the president of @entity22 , as the main military backer of a regime , the @entity55 regime , that the @entity70 has said has killed 200,000 of its own people -- tortured people , executed people			1
why does @entity22 want to be associated with that kind of genocidal barbarism ? " " the army of that country was carrying out a battle against the terrorists , " @entity5 replied			1
" they kept saying that these are opposition members and we will keep asking who are these opposition members who have preferred to take up arms so swiftly and so savagely and violent , reasons rather than resorting to talks and negotiations ? " @entity7 countered that " it all started when ( the @entity34 people ) wanted a little bit of reform and the government of that nation responded in a way that the @entity70 now says has caused the death of 200,000 civilians			1
" " if the army of the @entity34 people , the @entity34 government , had not stood up and fought against terrorism , " @entity5 said , " who do you think would have been the victor today ? let 's assume no one would have rendered assistance			1
the victor would have been the same people that everyone is recognizing as terrorists today			2
" ' justice will be employed ' @entity7 also asked the @entity6 leader about the detainment this summer of a high - profile journalist for the @entity114 , @entity115 , and his wife , @entity116			1
would @entity5 , as a gesture of goodwill , release them from custody , along with several others who have been detained , including an @entity123 - @entity6 woman , @entity124 , and the @entity23 @entity125 , @entity7 asked			1
" we never wish for any individuals , @entity6 or non-iranians , be it in @entity22 or in other countries , to be imprisoned or detained or be put on trial , " he said			1
" if they do go to trial , the trial will be fairly executed for them to have access to every legal defense allowed under the law , proper defensive representation through qualified attorneys , and we do hope that their families can gain the certainty that fairness and justice will be employed towards the cases and case files of their loved ones			0
" the president also noted that @entity22 does not recognize dual citizenship , so anyone with an @entity6 passport is considered @entity6 only by the government			1
" i do not believe that an individual would be detained or put in prison for being a journalist			1
an individual can be a reporter , a journalist , and have committed a crime			2
but that crime is not necessarily always related to their profession , to the profession that they 're practicing			0
" " my personal opinion is , and i 've announced it several times when i 've spoken on different occasions , we believe that the general behavior towards reporters and journalists and those who carry the heavy weight of informing our citizenry , must be quite flexible			0
" " the truth of the matter is that i can not have the time nor the inclination nor access to every single case file			0
but what i must ... be assured of as the chief executive of my branch is that the constitution and the laws and the civil rights are being respected to the letter			0
" nuclear negotiations @entity22 continues to be part of intense negotiations with the @entity23 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 over its nuclear program			1
in an effort to reach a permanent deal that would trade nuclear guarantees for the reduction of sanctions , world powers agreed earlier this year to extend the interim agreement that provided the framework for negotiations			0
that interim deal , @entity5 said , is " concrete proof that talks and negotiations succeed			1
" " we must all accept that there is only one way and that 's the way of dialogue and talks and negotiations , " he told @entity7			2
" this means that sanctions are an inappropriate tool			0
that means that threats are the wrong path			0
" both @entity22 and its negotiating partners are discussing the issues with the " utmost seriousness , " he said			1
" there are still differences of opinion			0
some of these differences of opinion can be quite significant			0
but at the end of the day , we must all strive to find a solution and resolve this			0
" right now there 's a november deadline to reach a permanent solution , after which the temporary sanctions relief and enrichment freezes would be lifted			2
@entity5 said that for now , @entity22 is only thinking about reaching that deal , not about another extension			1
even if a deal is agreed upon , various legislative bodies -- most importantly the @entity238 -- would still have to approve the lifting of sanctions			0
@entity7 asked whether it had been fully made clear to him how difficult that process could be			0
" that 's their own business , quite frankly , " the president said			2
" i do think that if the agreement is reached , it can immediately cease and melt away -- take away these sanctions			0
" ' our people realize ... we have taken steps forward ' @entity5 , through his office , is a prolific user of @entity256			2
but the platform remains off - limits to most @entity6 , who must use technical workarounds to access the service			0
in an interview with @entity7 last year , @entity5 said that all of his efforts were " geared to ensure that the people of @entity22 will comfortably be able to access all information globally and to use it			1
" as the @entity6 president spoke at the @entity267 in @entity268 , the ceo of @entity256 , @entity270 , sent out a tweet			2
" mr. president , enjoying your tweets from the @entity70 , " @entity270 wrote			2
" we would love the @entity6 people to enjoy them as well			0
when will that be ? " @entity7 asked @entity5 for his reaction			2
" it is correct we have not yet reached a point in which we feel completely comfortable in what our people intended during the elections and voted for			0
" " but our people realize that we have taken steps forward			0
and our people are fully aware that in such matters , we must have a coordination with other branches of the government -- with the judiciary , with the parliament , with the legislatures " -- a seeming reference to the fact that others in the @entity6 government may not be as keen to open up the internet as he is			2
" what is important to keep in mind is that we 've had sustainable movement forward throughout the past 12 - plus months			0
