-- two unmanned @entity2 spacecraft reached the moon 's orbit tuesday morning and began the process of mapping its surface for future missions			1
an unmanned @entity2 spacecraft captured this image of the moon from about 5,000 miles away tuesday			1
the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , a satellite whose instruments will help scientists compile high resolution , three - dimensional maps of the moon 's surface , entered lunar orbit at 6:27 a.m. et. about two hours later , the @entity21 and @entity22 ( @entity23 ) swung past the moon on its way into an elongated @entity26 orbit			1
the spacecraft sent streaming video back to @entity26 , shown on a @entity2 web site , for an hour as it passed the moon			1

the mission is the first in @entity2 's plan to return to the moon , then travel to @entity37 and beyond , the space agency said			2
during the mission , the agency will collect all sorts of data , including day - night temperature maps , @entity2 said			0
there is particular emphasis on the polar areas of the moon , where sunlight is more plentiful and where water might exist			0

the data that the @entity14 collects and sends to @entity26 also will be used in planning an eventual lunar outpost , the agency said			2
during its mission , the orbiter also will spend at least a year looking for potential landing sites for astronauts .			0
