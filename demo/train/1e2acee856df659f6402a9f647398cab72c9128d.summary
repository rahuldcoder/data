-- [ spoiler alert : if you have n't seen breaking @entity4 's series finale , stop reading now			1
] believe it or not , some people actually made it out of the @entity4 series finale alive			1
and even though we wo n't get to see their lives unfold , those survivors still have a ( potentially ) drug - free lifetime ahead of them			1
so what comes next ? if chapter one of their stories involved @entity18 , lots of desert , and even more drugs , what is chapter two ( or three ) all about ? here 's how we see the show 's biggest survivors 10 years from now : @entity25 and @entity26 : after burning through almost all of the money that @entity29 gave them for correctly using laser pointers , @entity25 and @entity26 decided that their drug days were behind them			2
plus , the blue stuff was no longer on the market , so everything else kind of sucked in comparison			2
after getting clean , @entity25 took his crazy ideas to @entity39 , where producers thought he was insane , but he found a small comedy team that hired him as a writer			2
he thinks they 're a drama group , but what he does n't know wo n't hurt him			2
@entity26 , after getting clean , replaced drugs with food and now weighs more than 300 lbs ... but his friends still call him @entity26			2
he moved to @entity39 with @entity25 and currently works as a bartender at the @entity49			2
he and @entity25 ( and their girlfriends of the moment ) share a duplex			2
they play video games and order pizza every night			2
but they now have to order two pizzas because , well , @entity26 eats a lot			2
@entity0 : see full coverage of ' @entity4 ' @entity61 and @entity62 : after @entity62 escaped the @entity63 , he drove straight to the police station			1

and while he was at the police station , he got @entity25 and @entity26 to move his money to a safe location			0
after that was all tied up , he went to see @entity61			1
turns out , @entity76 's mom had recently died of a heart attack , so @entity62 formally adopted @entity61			1
the duo now lives in @entity79 , where @entity62 has his own carpentry business			0
he spends his days making perfect boxes and so much more			0
he also sells his drawings on the side			0
@entity61 , meanwhile , is big into soccer and a straight - a student who only ever gets in trouble at school for his over-use of the word " bitch			1
" his favorite breakfast meal is a @entity92			0
@entity93 and @entity94 : @entity93 just recently went into remission after having battled lung cancer			1
she blames the stress of being married to @entity29 for her smoking , much like @entity94 blames her recent shop - lifting adventures on how she still misses @entity100			1
but all in all , the sisters are doing well			0
they live together in a beautiful @entity103 home			0
@entity93 has taken to swimming in the morning to start off her day , and she spends the rest of it writing ( and still drinking a little too much )			1
she 's currently writing her second book , a follow - up to the story of a chemistry teacher who started cooking meth to make money for his family			1
the first one ended with the main characters getting involved with a drug lord , and the second one picks up with a flash - forward to a plane crash			1
she calls the series @entity4			1
it 's growing more popular with each book			0
meanwhile , @entity94 is still a nurse			0
she 's finally back to wearing purple , but @entity93 has limited the amount of purple in the home to @entity94 's individual room			1
and hidden in the corner of @entity94 's purple room is her very own rock mineral collection			0
@entity0 : ' @entity4 ' - 10 questions we 'll never see resolved @entity29 and @entity133 : now living on his own after college ( he inherited a ton of money on his 18th birthday ) , @entity134 has taken up residence with his girlfriend in @entity141 , where he works as a lawyer			1
his mentor ? some guy who looks a lot like @entity146			0
@entity147 : living in @entity103 with mom and @entity94 , @entity147 is ( not surprisingly ) a science prodigy			0
they suspect she 'll go to college on a full - ride by the time she 's 16			1
but whether she 'll use that knowledge for good or bad is yet to be seen			0
let 's just hope she does n't unknowingly buy out of a billion - dollar company for $ 5,000 and spend the rest of her life regretting it			2
after all , everyone keeps talking about how much she reminds them of @entity29			0
she even asks @entity93 to cut the crust off of all her sandwiches			1
double flash - forward : @entity147 and @entity61 team up to create a drug empire ! too much ? @entity163 and @entity164 : @entity164 finally rescued @entity163 from the hotel room where he filled him in on a little secret : he had been following the @entity63 and knew where all of @entity29 's money was stashed			1
