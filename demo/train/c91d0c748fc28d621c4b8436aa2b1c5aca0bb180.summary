-- @entity1 must now sit at home in shame			1
if press reports are accurate , @entity5 and about a dozen other @entity7 cheaters might do that too			1
but the homes they sit in are million - dollar mansions			2
that seems to be the lesson young athletes learn from the latest steroids scandal			1
sure , they look bad			2
but both @entity1 and @entity5 have millions of dollars to fall back on			1
what 's most troubling about this affair is how many of today 's young people believe cheating might be the only way to break through in sports			1
in a recent @entity26 poll , nearly half of males ages 18 through 25 thought that taking performance - enhancing drugs is critical to making it in professional sports or helping one 's athletic performance			1
and well more than half of those polled thought that at least one - third of the major leaguers in the recent @entity35 had used performance - enhancing drugs , often called @entity37 , to get where they are			1
the problem is , for every @entity1 and @entity5 , a thousand young men will never make the majors -- but are willing to risk their health , even their lives , by taking @entity45			1
these young athletes need to hear more about @entity46 than @entity1			1
@entity46 was a star high school pitcher who turned to steroids to get to the next level			1
although the steroids bulked up his body , they wreaked havoc on his emotions until one day he hanged himself			2
his father , @entity54 , has committed his life to trying to help other young athletes steer clear of steroids			2
tragic decisions come when you combine motive with opportunity			2
that 's what we have here			0
young athletes see juiced - up athletes in a number of sports get fame and glory and multimillion contracts			1
they want to be like them			0
they can go online and find dozens of websites that offer to sell anabolic steroids and other peds online			2
they do n't have to find a shadowy figure lurking on a corner in a long overcoat			0
teenagers know how to find just what they think they need on @entity84 , @entity85 and other websites that parents have n't even heard of			0
but these children know nothing about the dangers of even the purest of steroids , not to mention those that are contaminated with dangerous substances			2
the @entity95 has found peds that contain contaminants such as lead and other heavy metals , liquid mixers such as cooking oil , horse urine and other filthy contents			0
what can parents do to keep their kids safe ? pay attention to sudden fluctuations in weight and muscle growth			0
if your son or daughter suddenly bulks up , it could be cause for concern			0
additionally , pay attention to an extreme shift in personality			0
teens are prone to mood shifts , but if suddenly your teen athlete is filled with unexplained rage , speak to him or her about what may be causing the extreme emotions			1
it 's also important to pay attention to @entity128 and credit card use			0
many teenagers have credit cards , which can be easily used to purchase @entity45 online			0
recently , the consumer group i head , @entity132 , made four purchases online , and the illegal drugs arrived in just under a month			2
talk to your teenagers regularly about why they should n't be using @entity45			0
to use them is cheating , they are illegal to possess without a prescription , and they can do serious damage to teens ' bodies and their minds			1
it 's a sad fact that if they play high school or college sports , these youths probably already know of someone who has taken @entity45			2
do n't assume it 's someone else 's problem			0
most important , do n't ignore the warning signs , even if it leads to a tough conversation			0
make sure young athletes hear the whole story			0
most of the media coverage around the @entity7 scandal is whether the @entity162 use is " worth " the risk of millions of dollars in lost salary and the shame that comes with getting caught			1
but the real risk for young athletes is their health			0
the young athletes who appear to be our fit and finest could be facing decades of health trouble -- including liver abnormalities and tumors , increased risk for heart attacks , depression and more -- from taking @entity45			1
make sure that for every story about @entity5 , they hear about @entity46			1
let them know that fame and money -- and the risk of shame -- are not what really is at stake here			0
when they use @entity45 , they are risking their lives and their health			0
and that is never worth the risk			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			1

@entity191 : @entity1 , @entity5 still have millions despite *baseball* scandal
@entity191 : many teens think cheating might be the only way to break through in sports
remember @entity46 , he says , a teen who *killed* himself under *influence* of steroids
@entity191 : tell teens performance - enhancing drugs cause liver trouble , depression and more
