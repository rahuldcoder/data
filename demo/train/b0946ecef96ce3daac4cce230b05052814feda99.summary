lawmakers from both parties defended the @entity4 administration 's attempt to rescue @entity6 journalist @entity5 early sunday morning , even though the dangerous mission did not result in saving @entity9 's life			1
" it was an unfortunate outcome , " @entity11 chairman @entity10 , a @entity12 , told @entity13 on @entity15 's " @entity14			2
" " but i do believe you have to make these kinds of decisions			0
" rep. @entity20 , @entity21 , who also serves on committee , said on " @entity23 " on sunday , " obviously we would have loved to be able to rescue these hostages and preserve their lives			1
" " but i think it was the right decision to make ... the president made the call , the tough call that it was worth the risk			0
and i think he was exactly right , " he said			0
@entity6 photojournalist @entity5 and @entity34 @entity33 , a teacher who was reportedly set to be released on sunday , were fatally shot in the compound by terrorists as the secret mission unfolded , a @entity6 official said sunday			1
some critics have argued , in light of recent hostage killings , the administration should reconsidered its policy not to negotiate ransoms with terrorist organizations			1
but in a visit to @entity47 sunday , defense secretary @entity45 defended the administration 's policy , while also acknowledging that the @entity50 needs to be careful in how it conducts raids			1
" there 's an immense amount of focus and time and review that goes into these operations , " @entity53 told reporters , according to a pool report			2
" so , i do n't think it 's a matter of going back and having a review of our process			1
our process is about as thorough as there can be			0
" " is it imperfect ? yes			0
is there risk ? yes			0
but we start with the fact that we have an @entity6 that 's being held hostage , and that @entity6 's life is in danger			1
that 's where we start , and then we proceed from there , " said the outgoing secretary			2
both @entity10 and @entity20 also defended the administration 's hostage policy -- and like @entity53 -- they acknowledged that improvements need to be made to @entity6 rescue operations			1
" when you pay ransom , you get more kidnappings			2
that 's certainly what we saw across @entity89			0
we 're certainly seeing it in @entity91 as well , " @entity10 said			1
" if we 're going to be extorted into paying ransom to @entity94 so that they can rape women and blow up buildings and kill civilians , men , women and children , that 's a pretty bad plan to start with			0
i agreed with the president 's decision			0
" @entity20 reinforced @entity105 's position that paying ransoms only fuels more violence			2
" i think you end up funding other hostage taking and the cycle just perpetuates itself , so i think our decision is the right one , " he said			0
" rather , try to rescue our hostages than pay ransoms , and , of course , prospectively trying to keep our people out of harm 's way			1
i think that is really the right policy , as painful as it is , and as enormously agonizing as it is for the families of these hostages			0

lawmakers on both sides of the aisle defended the @entity4 administration 's @entity91 rescue attempt
a failed effort led to the deaths of hostages @entity5 , an @entity6 journalist , and @entity33 , a @entity34 teacher
the @entity6 should n't pay ransoms to terrorists , the lawmakers said
