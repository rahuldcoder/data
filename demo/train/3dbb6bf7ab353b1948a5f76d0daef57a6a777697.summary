-- taking a cue from @entity2 and services such as its own @entity4 , @entity5 on wednesday began rolling out the ability for users to embed posts on their own blogs and websites			1
" when embedded , posts can include pictures , videos , hashtags and other content , " @entity5 's @entity11 wrote in a post on the site			1
" people can also like and share the post directly from the embed			2
" @entity22 will only be possible with posts that were made public or posted by someone who allows nonfriend subscribers , or fans , to their page			2
the feature is being rolled out wednesday on five sites -- first @entity0 , then @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity19			0
it will be rolled out more widely in the coming weeks			0
here 's how a post from @entity0 's main @entity5 account looks			2
. there were already ways to embed @entity5 posts using third - party tools			1
but the built - in feature makes it easier and more accessible for a much wider base of users			0
images from posts will be visible in the embeds , such as this post from the @entity51 royal family 's facebook page after @entity52 was born last week			0
. embedding posts , which is already popular among bloggers and news sites through tools such as @entity58 , is a way to reference social media material automatically and an attractive method for sites such as @entity5 to pull in traffic			1
once the feature is enabled for a user , that user will be able to click an " @entity68 " link from a menu in the spot currently occupied by the " @entity72 " link			0
the user then will be able to copy and paste a string of code onto their own website to share the post just as it appears on @entity5			1
for example , a shot of " first dog " @entity80 from president @entity82 's account			0

@entity5 is rolling out a feature that lets you embed posts
users can share posts on their blogs and websites
embedding only works for public posts on the site
@entity5 is following @entity2 , which already allowed embedding *tweets*
