-- " it could have been the secret to my success or the secret to my demise , " a wistful @entity0 says of her 2013 season			1
the irresistible force in women 's tennis is talking about her record - breaking year , one in which she vowed to play more than she ever had done previously			2
it was a decision that paid huge dividends			0
not only did her victories at the @entity15 and @entity16 take her grand slam tally to 17 , she also successfully defended her season - ending @entity19 crown			1
she claimed 11 titles in 2013 -- the best return in the women 's game for 16 years -- adding $ 12.3 million in prize money to what has become a very healthy bank balance over the years			2
far from slowing down , @entity0 has a new spring in her step at the age of 32			2
her 17 major titles mean she is just one behind @entity30 and @entity31 and within sight of @entity33 , out in front on 22 grand slam titles in the post- 1968 open era			1
" it is getting exciting , " @entity0 told @entity6			1
" i have four grand slams next year to try and at least catch up with @entity31 and @entity38 so it will be really exciting			1
" hopefully i can do it but really being here 17 is fun , obviously i want more and i never want to stop until i reach my goals			0
" i 'm excited about just looking forward to the possibilities of next year			0
" i started with 15 and this year i 'm starting with 17 ( next year ) so hopefully i can win a couple -- one , two or three , who knows ? any would be good for me			0
" @entity0 's career has been transformed since she teamed up with coach @entity48 after a demoralizing first round defeat at the @entity50			1
having tumbled to 175 in the world after a series of injury - hit seasons , he helped @entity0 roar back to the top of the game ; if and when @entity0 breaks 18 , his pride will be immeasurable too			1
" @entity31 and @entity30 , they are legends , so to have @entity0 part of this small group means a lot , " @entity57 said			1
" it means a lot to her too that she 's only one grand slam away to reach them and then maybe to overtake them it 's an option that you can really think about it			0
" there will be a lot of emotion when she 'll be close to winning the next grand slam and sitting next to those great champions , but she can make it			0
" @entity33 is a bit far away still			0
i think it 's too early to speak about @entity33 -- she has 22 -- so ( @entity0 ) has to win five more and six more to overtake @entity33 so that 's a long way			2
" i think it 's important not to look at the mountain when you want to climb it , just the next step			0
" @entity48 is from the school of thought that a defeat , however painful , can provide an important reality check and provoke an elite athlete into a drive to ensure it is n't repeated			0
that pivotal reverse to @entity91 at the @entity15 last year spurred @entity0 on to a spike in form and another shock grand slam exit -- to @entity96 at @entity97 this year -- acted as a similar catalyst			1
" it was definitely motivating -- i definitely learnt a lot from that match , " @entity0 explains of her defeat to the @entity101 in round four			2
" it was n't good that i lost but it was good that i was able to learn from that loss and i was able to do better and i won some matches because of that loss so i guess it helped me out			0
" and though @entity0 is quick to pay tribute to her team from agent to coach , hitting partner to physio , she also revealed that she still leans on the support of her mum , who was with her during her triumphant @entity19 campaign , and dad to help her game			1
she said : " i called my dad every match at the @entity16 from the third round on , he really helped me in that tournament , and he really helped me behind the scenes to win some matches			2
" i was really happy to have the support and have his help and so yeah i definitely rely on my dad and my dad for a lot of coaching			0
