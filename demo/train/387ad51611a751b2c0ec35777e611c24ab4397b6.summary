-- yet again we are struggling to bear the unbearable			1
how can we find meaning in the massacre of so many innocent children , savagely cut down in a hail of bullets ? @entity6 is much on our minds these days and , fortunately , there is much his life teaches us about giving meaning to human horror			1
eleven months from now , we will be celebrating the 150th anniversary of his journey to @entity13 , @entity14 , where he consecrated a national cemetery in honor of the thousands slaughtered in the @entity20 battle there			0
in the most eloquent address in @entity24 history , @entity6 told us , " the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here , but it can never forget what they did here			1
it is for us the living , rather , to be dedicated here to ( their ) great unfinished work			0
" in their honor , he concluded , " we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation , under @entity42 , shall have a new birth of freedom			1
" these were not idle words ; he devoted himself to action			0
in the final months of his life , as the new film on @entity6 shows , he threw himself into the enactment of the 13th amendment , outlawing slavery in the entire nation			1
after his death , the nation continued to act as he had asked , passing the 14th amendment and quickening its progress toward realizing the dream of the declaration : that all are created equal			0
the shootings in @entity62 are not @entity13 , but surely the long , unending string of killings that we have endured must do more than touch our hearts			0
as @entity6 saw , we must find meaning in the madness of life -- and we do that by honoring the dead through action			1
the moment to act is now upon us , not to be lost as we rush headlong into the holiday season and more twists and turns ahead			0
we are better than that			0
there is a common thread running through most of the mass killings we have seen in recent years : a deranged gunman gets his hands on a gun , usually a semi-automatic , and rapidly cuts down innocents before anyone can stop him			1
clearly , we must find better answers for the mentally unstable			1
we have the ability to recognize the characteristics of those more likely to commit such acts of violence , and we must do more to provide long - term treatment			0
but just as clearly , we need to change our culture of guns			1
there is something terribly wrong in a nation that has some 300 million guns floating around , easily accessible to the mentally ill. of the 62 mass shootings in the @entity24 over the past three decades , more than three - quarters of the guns used were obtained legally			1
unless we act to change our laws as well as our culture , we will all be enablers when the next loner strikes			2
the blood will be on our hands , too			0
experts can come up with precise policy prescriptions that will allow us to maintain the constitutional freedoms of the @entity109 while also changing our gun culture			1
contrary to what the @entity112 says , it is very possible to do both			0
what is needed immediately is a conversation determining what principles we want to establish -- and then action to realize them			2
from my perspective , there should be at least three basic principles : @entity124 : to own a gun , you must first have a license -- and it should n't be easy to get			1
the right parallel is to cars : everyone over a prescribed age is entitled to drive			0
but cars are dangerous , so we first require a license -- determining that you are fit to drive			2
citizens have a right to bear arms , but guns are dangerous , too			2
so , get a license			0
there are a number of issues with our current system of state - based permits			0
first , variation in gun regulations from state to state deeply complicates enforcement efforts			2
@entity151 , for instance , allows concealed carry without any permit , while its neighbor @entity155 has implemented the strongest gun laws in the country			2
we must design a sensible federal gun control policy to address the current legal chaos			2
as we construct a federal licensing system , we should look to @entity155			0
the state requires all gun sales to be processed through a licensed dealer , mandating background checks and a ten - day waiting period ; bans most assault weapons and all large - capacity magazines ; closes the nonsensical gun - show loophole ; and maintains a permanent record of all sales			1
second : if you are a civilian , you ca n't buy an assault gun			1
hunters do n't need military style weapons , nor do homeowners who want to be able to protect their families			2
they are far too popular among people who should n't have access to guns in the first place			2
we should restore the federal ban that has expired			0
third : parents should be heavily advised to keep guns out of their houses and out of the hands of kids			2
no one wants to blame the poor mother of the @entity62 shooter , but everyone wonders why she kept so many military - style guns in the house , so accessible to her son			0
it 's hard to believe , but roughly a third of households with children younger than 18 contain at least one gun			1
in too many neighborhoods in @entity24 -- not just in big cities -- parents who do n't allow guns in their homes are apprehensive , even frightened , by their kids playing at homes where they are kept			1
some years ago , no one thought that we could change our tobacco culture			0
no one thought that we could reduce drunk driving by teenagers			0
we did -- thanks in large part to @entity218			0
years from now , no one will note what we say after this latest massacre			0
but they will hold us morally accountable for what we do			1
to honor all of those who have been slain in recent years -- starting with the first - graders in @entity62 -- we should highly resolve to change our culture of guns			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			1

@entity230 says we should take a *cue* from @entity6 's @entity233
he says @entity24 must deal with its culture of guns and find real solutions
gun owners should be licensed , and assault weapons should be banned , he says
he says we will be held morally accountable for what we do -- or fail to do
