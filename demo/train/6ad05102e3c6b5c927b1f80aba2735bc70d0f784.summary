@entity3 , @entity4 -- " your flight has been delayed due to a mechanical problem " -- it is something a passenger never really wants to hear especially during @entity8 week			1

@entity5 went behind the scenes with maintenance crews at @entity14 at its base in @entity3 to find out how they work to keep planes flying safe and on time			1
more than 600 flights will go through @entity3 this wednesday alone			2
before any flight takes off , a mechanic examines the plane to make sure there is nothing wrong			1
" we do just a walk around inspection , then we go upstairs and check the gauges and the log books and if there is anything broken we will fix it at that point , " @entity14 technician @entity24 told @entity5 as he inspected a 737 just arrived from @entity25			2
" we look at all the critical things -- anything at all broken , leaking , worn out			0

" after looking at a million of them you will pretty much recognize anything at all out of place , " he said			1
when a problem is detected in the air , a pilot can enter details of the issue into the plane 's in - flight computer so maintenance can be standing by when it lands to make a quick fix			1
often this work can be as simple as a broken in - flight entertainment system or just a seat cushion wet from a spilled drink which can be quickly replaced without causing a delay			1
if repair work requires a long time , planes are moved to the hangar area			0
during @entity5 's visit , the airline 's new @entity67 was there so teams could check out a couple of the systems on a layover			0
" we are kind of getting to know it , " maintenance supervisor @entity75 said standing outside the cockpit			1
" it 's very electronic , a lot more than any airplane we 've ever had before			0
the systems are completely different than any airplane we ever had			0
" in the passenger compartment , a computer by the door can show technicians on board problems with a simple " we could run a test on all the monitors on the airplane and it would tell us if there is a problem , " @entity90 said			1
he is the manager of @entity14 technical operations and has spent more than 25 years working his way up with @entity99 and @entity14			0
" it has changed a lot from pushing all of the light switches on every light to see if it works , " he said			0

the airline is installing new carbon fiber brakes which will lighten the load and save the airline money			0

" they get deep into it , " @entity90 pointed out			0
" this is probably the highest level of maintenance you would do , " he said			1
" they will open the airplane up , inspect everything , replace a lot of components , lubricate everything and put it back together			0
" planes go into the hangar for these massive month - long overhauls every four or five years			1
" when these guys get it done , it will be in excellent shape , " he said			0
though much of @entity14 's maintenance is done in @entity3 and @entity138 , there are crews at 45 other airports around the world to work on the airline 's planes			1
in some cases they even have contracts to do work on competitors ' aircraft			0
there are about 8,000 @entity14 mechanics worldwide , as well as 2,000 other members of its @entity153 , including engineers , maintenance planners and inspectors			2
their goal , they say , is to make sure their planes are safe and they get you there on time and this busy holiday season is no different " it 's the same responsibility as it is every day , " @entity24 told @entity5			2
" our job does n't change if a plane is going to go one mile , empty , full -- our job is exactly the same			2
" " every plane has to go out safe			2
