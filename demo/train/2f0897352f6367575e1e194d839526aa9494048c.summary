in just two years , @entity0 went from full - time work to a part of the new underclass of unemployed			1
the longer it 's been since she was forced to leave her job with the @entity10 , the harder it gets to return to the ranks of the employed			1
even though the 46 - year - old mother of five has an accounting certificate and a mind for numbers , prospective employers " do n't so much as look at me because of my age or because of my work gap , " she says , referring to the period of time she 's been unemployed			1
" it 's always like , ' ok , thank you , we 'll call you within two weeks			1
' then three weeks go by			0
and when you call them , they say , ' oh , did n't you get a letter ? we 've found a more suitable candidate			0
' " two years after his release from prison , @entity29 was still struggling to find full - time , stable employment			1
he put out applications , but his phone did n't ring			0
the odd jobs , like cleaning cooking equipment for restaurants , helped , but after months of relying on his family for support with little to contribute in return , he felt like a bum			0
" i wanted to be one of the people who get up and go to work every day without breaking the law and have a quality of life , " he told @entity42 in a story she wrote for the @entity44			1
yet with no other options in sight , he turned for a time to what he knew to be a reliable source of income -- selling drugs in his @entity57 neighborhood — before finding help			0
the stories of @entity60 and @entity29 stories are n't outliers -- more and more @entity63 are finding themselves relegated to the margins of the economy , despite their best efforts to escape that fate			0
it breeds hardship and hopelessness , and it also violates a basic tenet of our social contract when temporary setbacks become permanent obstacles			0
the numbers reflect the extent of that permanence ; the longer you 've been out of work , the harder it is to find it again			1
that 's a troubling reality because for most @entity63 , the path to success is n't straightforward ; it 's punctuated with obstacles and pitfalls			1
to the immigrant in search of a fresh start , the entrepreneur in pursuit of a new business venture , or the countless families striving for a better tomorrow , it 's the promise of a second chance that animates the @entity98			1
many of the @entity103 , forty - niners and other pioneers who built our country were running from failures back east			1
on tuesday , president @entity105 will give his @entity107 address			1
one key issue he should address is the problem of long - term unemployment			1
while the unemployment rate has improved , there are many @entity63 who have fallen off the radar			0
to restore an economy capable of reaching its potential and renew our claim to be a nation that encourages its citizens to pursue their aspirations , we have to stop defining people by their failures			2
we need to rebuild the " second - chance " economy			2
as @entity0 found out , in today 's economy being unemployed now often makes you unemployable			1
one - third of the 10.5 million people who are currently jobless qualify as " long - term unemployed , " meaning they have been out of work for longer than six months			1
and in most parts of the country , discrimination against them is perfectly legal : just take a look at the map below			2
with three unemployed workers for every job opening , employers can be selective			1
in startling research , @entity138 , a labor economist at @entity139 , found that prospective employers consistently threw out resumes of applicants with a recent stint of unemployment in favor of applicants with consistent work histories -- even applicants with less education or no relevant work experience			2
it should be unsurprising , then , that @entity152 estimates that in any given month , only 11 % of the long - term unemployed will have attained steady , full - time employment a year later			1
and being consigned to the " long - term unemployed " category is more likely to result from bad timing than lack of talent			1
the single - greatest factor determining whether someone will bear the mark of " long - term unemployed " is what the unemployment rate was when he lost his job			1
workers may invest years in their education and acquiring the skills that make them successful at their jobs -- only to be rejected because of factors beyond their control			0
not only can this create a scarring effect that can permanently diminish their earning potential , it also results in a tremendous loss of human capital at a time when the economy is still struggling to recover			0
while discrimination against the long - term unemployed is permissible under the law , for individuals with a criminal conviction , it 's often mandatory			1
a groundbreaking report by the @entity186 recently documented over 45,000 legal barriers faced by those with a criminal record -- in employment , housing , student financial aid , access to a business license or a driver 's license , or even the right to vote			2
though targeted restrictions in the interest of public safety are needed , many others -- such as @entity199 's prohibition against employment as a bingo caller -- are simply arbitrary and punitive			2
the impact of these barriers is massive and disproportionately affects communities of color ( that 's partly because , as you can see below , communities of color have a much higher chance of going to prison than their white counterparts )			2
since 1980 , the number of incarcerated @entity63 has more than tripled -- reaching the highest rate in the world -- and one out of every 34 @entity63 is either behind bars , on probation , or on parole , many for non-violent drug offenses			0
the striking breakdown between the types of crimes is below			0
in all , according to the @entity227 , at least 65 million @entity63 , totaling more than one in four adults , have a criminal record , that subjects them to these mandatory " collateral consequences " ( such as being unable to get a driver 's license or to qualify for student financial assistance ) on top of their formal sentence			2
these policies keep ex-offenders on the outside of their families and communities , as well as of the economy and democracy			0
and , in the era of big data , the past does n't stay there			0
instead , past missteps and misfortunes will linger in permanent and public view			0
with the click of a button , information from employment histories and civil and criminal records to credit reports and foreclosures can be summoned and used to deny access to employment , housing , or the public assistance needed just to put food on the table			0
this data -- often full of inaccuracies -- will leave scars on millions of people , in many cases inflicted by automated processes that another human being never touches			2
what can be done ? to start delivering on the promise of a second - chance economy , policy efforts must focus on four key principles : -- employers must stop discriminating against applicants without a job that means removing employment status as a requirement in job postings and making sure human resources representatives are n't discarding the resumes of unemployed applicants on sight			1
some states have passed laws prohibiting discrimination against the unemployed			1
and in december 2013 , a @entity289 bill was introduced that offered tax incentives to employers of the long - term unemployed			1
though the bill was ultimately unsuccessful , laws alone are n't the answer because they 're so difficult to enforce and monitor			0
beyond legislation , the government could fund programs that build partnerships between corporations , local community colleges or workforce development organizations to align training of the currently unemployed with the jobs most needed within the company			2
it could also prioritize the long term unemployed in its own hiring practices			1
-- entering the criminal justice system should n't be a one - way street out of the economy through " ban the box " laws ( in other words , prohibiting the use of boxes applicants must check to indicate they 're unemployed ) , states and cities across the country are already limiting the impact of past incarceration on employment prospects			1
states could strengthen these efforts by both reducing first - time incarceration and taking a more holistic approach to reentry that connects ex-offenders with the basic tools they need to get jobs and manage money			2
for starters , states should provide each individual leaving a correctional facility with a state - issued @entity333 — a prerequisite to employment , opening a bank account , and accessing a range of other services and opportunities			2
-- give people who have encountered adversity the financial tools they need to start over everyone needs a safe , affordable place to store and transfer money			0
@entity346 is working with major financial service providers to remove barriers to bank accounts imposed by @entity350 , a database that banks use to estimate risk posed by potential customers			0
the city 's @entity355 estimates that this and similar databases have prevented more than 825,000 residents in @entity346 alone from opening an account , often as a result of isolated mistakes , like overdrafts , rather than the fraud it was intended to detect			0
-- @entity365 should n't be a tool for economic exclusion in an era of increasingly automated decision - making , we need to both ensure the privacy of those interacting with data systems , and strengthen the integrity of those systems			0
we can start by following this set of guidelines laid out by a high - profile coalition of civil rights groups			0
among them -- give individuals control over how a corporation can gather data from them ; allow people to ensure that the data used to make decisions about them is accurate			0
we 've all heard about the " right to be forgotten " ruling in @entity388			0
although it raises important concerns about the freedom of information , the response to that ruling shows that all of us -- and particularly those with blemishes on their record -- need a chance to make a fresh start			0
these are just a few examples of how we can begin to replace our policies and practices that double down on disadvantage with ones that restore second chances			0
a real second - chance economy will not only benefit those who are shut out of economic citizenship , but will also restore the dynamism and growth to our economy that will create jobs for everyone who wants to work .			1

in president @entity105 's @entity107 address , he should look at solutions for the jobless
the longer people have been out of work , the harder it is to find a job
we must have policy that stops discrimination against the long - term unemployed
