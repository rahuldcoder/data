endless dunes , scrubby vegetation , camels			2
@entity4 seems to have contemplated the kinds of things you 'd expect to find in a desert and responded : irrigate ! and so it has , planting not only botanical gardens but record - breaking botanical gardens , ski slopes complete with penguins ( no , not a mirage ) and dozens of greens , fairways and golfing water hazards			1
the secret ? well , desalinated water provides some of the countless gallons of water needed to realize these dreams but another source is somewhat dirtier			0
45 million flowers it takes a lot of water to maintain any kind of garden in the desert -- but imagine trying to keep 45 million flowers in bloom			1
that 's the task for the team behind @entity33 , a seven - hectare attraction that opened in february in the sands just outside the city limits			1
visitors are confronted with a riot of colorful -- some would say gaudy -- patterned flower beds , creative vertical displays and manicured lawns			2
with precipitation such a rarity in @entity4 -- it falls on fewer than 25 days a year , on average -- the plants are kept hydrated using waste water and a drip irrigation system			1
a butterfly garden is next on the cards here and , this being @entity4 , there are already world records to boast of -- the longest ( 800 meters ) wall of flowers , the world 's biggest flower clock and the tallest flower pyramid			1
an effort not to be sneezed at			0
@entity33 : @entity60 3 , @entity62 / @entity61 ; +971 4 422 8902 ; general admission : $ 5.40 per adult			1
more : best @entity4 brunches : the good , the very good and the ' drunch ' fairways and greens golf should n't be a desert sport			1
while all that sand might be good for bunker practice , lush fairways sound rather fanciful			0
however , this is the @entity73 , which seems to have staked its reputation on creating real - life mirages			0
the emirate has more than 20 golf courses -- but how do they keep the greens green ? the answer 's dirtier than you might hope			1
" we use treated sewage effluent for irrigation , " among other sources , says @entity81 , agronomy manager at @entity82			0
a hi - tech system " deliver [ s ] the precise amount of water depending on topography , wind directions and soil conditions			0
" @entity82 : @entity93 , @entity4 ; +971 4 375 9999 ; 18 holes from around $ 100 at the cheapest visitor twilight rate			1
a wetland wilderness you 'll find birdies of a different kind , and a taste of wetland wilderness in an unexpected locale , at the @entity103 on the northern edge of @entity4			1
some 20,000 birds of 67 species make their home in these saline lagoons , which are fed by the @entity110 inlet and protected from the city 's ever - expanding urban development			0
waders such as egrets , spoonbills and flamingos , as well as raptors including ospreys and greater spotted eagles , give a real feeling of wildness next to the ultra-urban environment of @entity4			2
@entity123 : @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity4 ; +971 4 606 6822 ; entrance is free but visitors must register at the @entity129 website			2
more : best falafel in @entity4 -- and the woman behind it penguins and snow rather surreal , a small colony of 20 king and gentoo penguins recently took up residence in the emirate 's @entity4 attraction and can be observed marching across the artificial snow - covered slopes			1
even without the penguins , a winter sports arena in the desert is more than a little incongruous			2
occupying 25,000 sq meters of the huge @entity146 , the self - styled indoor ski resort opened in 2006 and boasts five separate runs , complete with chairlift and tow			1
basically one giant refrigerator , temperatures are kept at -1c during the day , then dip to -6c at night when cooled water is blasted out of an overhead snow gun and turned into new snow			0
ski @entity4 : mall of the @entity156 , off @entity157 , @entity4 ; +971 4 409 4000			1
two - hour ski passes cost $ 55 per adult			2
full - day passes are $ 83 per adult			0
@entity160 encounters from $ 40			0
fun runners given that most advice for getting about in the desert around @entity4 is to travel inside an air - conditioned 4x4 and not over-exert yourself for fear of heat stroke , the sight of a gaggle of runners pounding the outback highways is a strange one			1
temperatures often exceeding @entity174 do not , however , deter participants in the @entity176 , a 10 - kilometer race following empty asphalt roads through the dunes			0
races are held around six times a year , including in august , when the race kicks off at 6 a.m. to avoid the worst of the summer heat			0
@entity176 , +971 4 420 6001			0
races start from @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity4			2
entry fee for the 10 - kilometer race : $ 22 ; three - kilometer fun run and junior race options also available			2
more : @entity192 in @entity4 : the extravagant edition water slides in times gone by , when @entity202 trekked across the @entity204 desert in search of water sources , the thought of people floating down a nearby river on rubber rings , or riding an artificial wave on a boogie board , would have been considered the stuff of mirages			1
but now there are not one but four big water parks in the @entity73 -- @entity212 ( +971 4 348 4444 ) and @entity213 ( +971 4 426 0000 ) in @entity4 , @entity214 in @entity215 ( +971 6 768 1888 ) , and @entity216 in @entity217 ( +971 2 414 2000 )			1
each pumps millions of liters of desalinated seawater through dozens of rides each day for the entertainment of aqua - loving thrillseekers			0
at @entity212 , 600 gallons of water a minute surge through the white - knuckle @entity225 to propel riders down its steep slide at more than 80kph			0
@entity230 helped with research for this article .			0

@entity33 boasts around 45 million flowers in bloom
