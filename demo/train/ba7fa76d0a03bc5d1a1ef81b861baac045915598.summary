the 23 other passengers and crew were rescued on sunday , pulled from the water by local fishermen and search and rescue teams			1
the survivors spent more than 36 hours in the water			0
the two missing people are believed to be @entity17 , other passengers on board said -- though officials at the @entity17 foreign ministry could not confirm this			1
the tourists -- mostly from @entity24 -- were on what was supposed to be an exotic getaway : a cruise from west to east , departing from the island of @entity30 -- which lies opposite @entity31 -- in the province of @entity33 and ending in @entity34 , in @entity35 , with a number of stops along the way			1
under normal conditions , the journey would take four nights to complete			0
boat hits rocks everything appeared fine when the vessel , named @entity46 , set sail last thursday			1
three days into the trip , the boat ran into trouble			1
@entity51 , head of the rescue mission , who like many @entity54 goes by one name , says it 's believed the boat hit rocks off @entity59 , at about 1 a.m. local time on saturday morning			1
@entity61 began leaking into the vessel , forcing the passengers and crew to abandon ship			1
the vessel was carrying 20 tourists , three crew and two local guides			2
@entity51 said authorities were first notified of the incident on sunday morning and immediately deployed rescuers to the site			1
the nearest town is @entity75 on the island of @entity77 -- a two - hour boat ride away from where the boat sank			1
recounting the disaster , one of the survivors said the group decided to split into two			1
" there was a coastline visible , a deserted island about five kilometers ( 3.1 miles ) through rough water , " @entity85 from @entity86 told @entity0 affiliate the @entity88			2
" the 10 strongest swimmers decided to swim for the coast and they thought they 'd probably survive it and luckily they did , but it was very close			2
" in the end , @entity85 said the group got within half a kilometer of shore but were exhausted			2
they were able to wave at a group of fishermen on the beach , who went out to retrieve half of them on sunday afternoon			1
search officials say the other five were picked up by rescue crews			0
all from the first group were taken to hospital in @entity75			2
another 13 passengers and crew stayed in the water near the sunken boat , using lifebuoys and life vests to stay afloat			1
they were retrieved by local fishermen on sunday evening , in the waters of @entity119			2
they 've since been treated in hospital , and eight are staying at a hotel in @entity75 , waiting for officials from their respective consulates to arrive to help them			0
lack of equipment another survivor , @entity17 national @entity127 , criticized the lack of equipment on the boat			1
" there was no security , no radio , no gps , no navigation equipment			2
there were nothing , " he told @entity0 affiliate @entity5			0
" only life jacket , but life jacket , it does n't work			0
if you 're in the middle of the ocean with a life jacket , what happens ? nothing			0
" " this problem should have been solved very , very easy , " another unidentified survivor told the @entity88			2
" we could have had a boat coming to rescue us in one hour , if they would have had any machine , radio , gps or anything that all the boats will have			2
but without everything , maybe people are dead			0
" however , the tour operator rejected the survivors ' claims			1
@entity163 , owner of @entity164 , told @entity0 there was equipment on board to call for help			0
" i admit no gps , but the boat had two radio communications and was working well , " he said			0
@entity163 said the boat was only three months ' old and modeled on a traditional @entity174 sail boat -- but with a motor			0
he did admit he did not have a full list of the passengers ' names and passport numbers			0
" we normally do not make copies of the passports of the tourists for the cruise , " he said			0
" passengers usually write down their own names and passport numbers on a list -- that 's why in this case , some tourists wrote only their first names			0
i can not read some of their handwriting clearly			0
" the two tourists still missing are believed to be male adults			0
@entity51 said it 's believed the missing men , who were with the second group , became separated owing to strong currents			1
