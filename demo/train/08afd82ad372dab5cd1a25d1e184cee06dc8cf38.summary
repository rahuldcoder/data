@entity0 -- house speaker @entity2 and other conservatives shot down a proposal from a senior congressional @entity5 who suggested that his @entity5 colleagues break from their firm anti-tax position and agree to a demand from @entity10 to immediately renew middle - class tax cuts			1
rep. @entity12 of @entity13 , a member of the leadership team that helps round up @entity16 votes , told fellow @entity5 lawmakers that he thought they should , as a matter of political strategy , extend just the tax - rate cuts for those making $ 250,000 or less before the end of the year -- a position being pushed by president @entity24 and congressional @entity10			1
@entity12 first floated the idea at a closed - door meeting of the @entity5 whip team on tuesday and his comments were first reported by @entity29			1
@entity12 told reporters after another meeting on wednesday with @entity16 @entity5 that he believed giving certainty to the majority of @entity35 taxpayers now was important			2
but he emphasized that he still opposed increasing tax rates for upper - income @entity35			0
" in my view , we all agree that we 're not going to raise taxes on people who make less than $ 250,000			1
we should just take them out of this discussion right now , continue to fight against any rate increases , continue to work honestly for a much bigger deal , " @entity12 said			2
new poll : majority support taxing wealthier @entity35 @entity12 added that major issues should be worked out in the debate next year			1
" we need to deal with entitlement spending			0
we need to deal with job creation			0
rates are intimately tied to that			0
so let 's have that discussion			0
but i think it 's easier to have without a lot of people whose taxes we do n't intend to raise being worried they might get raised			0
" @entity12 's tuesday comments were reported and distributed broadly by @entity10 as a major development in the fiscal cliff talks			1
but they were quickly rejected by @entity2 , who is negotiating with the @entity16 and @entity10 leaders on a way to avert the combination of spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect without an agreement by year 's end			1
" i told @entity12 earlier in our conference meeting that i disagreed with him , " @entity2 told reporters after meeting with @entity5 rank and file			1
" he 's a wonderful friend of mine and a great supporter of mine but raising taxes on the so - called top 2 percent -- half of those taxpayers are small business owners that pay their taxes through personal income tax filing every year			2
" at the wednesday meeting in the @entity91 , @entity2 also made a point in his opening remarks to tell members he disagreed with @entity12 , according to two @entity5 sources who were in the meeting			1
@entity97 : fiscal battle over mortgage deduction one of these sources said @entity12 brought up his idea with @entity5 members in the meeting , saying he did not support raising any rates			1
conservatives immediately rejected @entity12 's idea , and seemed annoyed that the attention on his comments was taking away from their focus to press @entity10 to agree to some major entitlement reforms as part of a broad agreement to address tax rates and the automatic spending cuts			1
@entity117 @entity116 rep. @entity116 did n't mince words when asked by @entity1 about @entity12 's idea			1
" i think he 's wrong and i think most of the conference thinks that he 's wrong , " @entity116 said			0
" i think he 's , you know , he 's a good man who 's served here for a long time			0
but he 's also a man who has voted for a lot of the increased spending in @entity0 , and that 's the problem			0
" @entity97 : it 's time to fix the charitable deduction " i think this is a false choice between running off the fiscal cliff and damaging the economy , or raising rates on small businesses and professionals that also damages the economy , " @entity128 @entity5 @entity127 , a senior member of the tax - writing @entity129 , said			0
@entity12 said he would continue to discuss his suggestion with colleagues , and predicted that if it came up for a vote , it would pass the @entity5 - led @entity16			2
but @entity5 aides made it clear there are no plans for any vote on a bill to separate the middle - class tax cuts from those for higher - income earners			1
even though @entity5 criticized the idea , @entity10 praised @entity12			1
sen. @entity152 , @entity153 , highlighted his shift in a speech on the @entity157 floor			0
" i applaud representative @entity12 for that common - sense and brave position			2
i am hopeful that he can persuade other @entity5 to do the right thing for our families , small business owners and communities across the country who have so much at stake and who are looking to us to solve this problem , " @entity160 said			0
@entity173 's no - tax pledge has survived challenges before that kind of endorsement probably wo n't help @entity12 make his case with fellow @entity5			2
asked about potential backlash to his idea from anti-tax groups focused on enforcing a " pledge " not to raise taxes , @entity12 seemed nonplussed			2
" my job is to get the best deal from the @entity35 taxpayers that i can get , " he said			0
" if by keeping the pledge taxes go up on everybody , then i do n't know if that 's a very good idea			0
if , on the other hand , we can negotiate a deal , which i think we can , which keeps rates where they are but provides revenue and certainly protects people below $ 250,000 , i think we have a responsibility to try and do that			1
" after the meeting with the rank and file , @entity16 @entity5 leaders were sitting down in the @entity91 with several @entity202 who are part of the " @entity207 " coalition chaired by @entity205 , the former head of @entity24 's deficit reduction committee			0
@entity2 delivered a message to his members that he planned to reiterate to the @entity202 , " we wo n't be party to a deal that protects big businesses and preserves special - interest tax breaks while raising tax rates on the small businesses we 're counting on to create jobs			2
" after the meeting @entity205 told reporters he did not see the @entity5 showing any flexibility in their opposition to any tax rate increases .			0
