@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 needs lots of things right now			1
one of them is @entity7			1
as the @entity11 talks this week made clear , there is no end in sight for the bloody three - year war in @entity3			1
in the meantime , more than 100,000 people have been killed , the country is destroyed , and millions of @entity3 have fled their homes , half of them children			1
this is the defining war and humanitarian crisis of this decade , which was underscored by my visit to @entity3 refugees here this week			1
and yet there is no outcry from the broader rich - country public to end the suffering there			1
to the extent that the media cover @entity3 , it is a diplomatic and political story			2
my media contacts say they need a " fresh angle " on the humanitarian aspect of @entity3 in order to get it covered			2
my friends on @entity38 say they 're hearing nothing about @entity3 from their constituents , after a surge of opposition to the idea of punitive airstrikes this summer			2
my fellow fundraisers share my frustration that we ca n't get much traction with donors around @entity3			2
contrast that to a major natural disaster like the recent typhoon in the @entity53			0
when a catastrophic , photogenic act of @entity56 kills thousands of people and makes millions more homeless in an instant , news crews get mobilized , benefit concerts get arranged , the public gets generous , and the needs on the ground get met			0
but what if the killer is a complex , drawn - out , difficult - to - cover war with no clear good guys and bad guys , as it is in @entity3 ? well , those people need @entity7			1
here 's one example of why : @entity71 , the global humanitarian organization i work for , raised more charitable dollars for the @entity53 in three days -- about $ 1.5 million -- than we have raised for @entity3 in almost three years			1
tragic as the typhoon was , the @entity53 is on a road to rehabilitation			0
@entity3 , on the other hand , is slowly bleeding to death			2
' courage and magnetism ' we need a telethon			0
we need letters to members of @entity86			0
of course that kind of activism alone is n't going to end the war and get @entity3 everything they need , but it is a great place to start			1
that 's where someone like @entity7 comes in			1
@entity7 is a rare public figure with the credibility , courage , and magnetism to take an urgent , complicated issue and make it matter to @entity100			2
to be clear , i am suggesting that @entity3 needs @entity7 more figuratively than literally			1
the authentic involvement of cultural icons helps form a movement , and that makes @entity3 more than some distant quagmire			2
some shared sense of urgency and ownership is critical to breaking the horrific stasis of the situation in and around @entity3 , a situation that is perpetuated in part by the rich - world public generally sitting @entity3 out			1
sometimes when i have this conversation with someone , they 'll ask why people should get engaged on issues overseas when there are so many problems at home in the @entity100			0
it 's an important point , but keep in mind that of all the charitable donations @entity100 made in 2012 , only 6 % went to international causes			0
aid workers are often dismissive of entertainers who get involved in their causes , and there are plenty of cases of unhelpful dabbling			0
but look at @entity7 and @entity133 on @entity134			2
@entity139 on just about everything			0
these celebrities , when working in partnership with policymakers , companies , philanthropists , and aid groups on the ground , can become the hugely powerful advocates that desperate people need			1
like the people i met this week at the @entity153 in southern @entity1			0
these 153 families fled @entity3 with little and are living packed together in an unfinished office building			0
no glass in the windows			0
no school , no privacy , and no end in sight			0
they are totally dependent on the generosity of others , and yet neither charitable nor government funds are sufficient to meet their needs right now			0
right now , the people of @entity3 need powerful friends to speak up , and @entity7 - so often the hero , on - screen and off - could call together the voices of support that these people so deserve			1
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			0

there is no - end in sight for @entity3 's bloody war , writes @entity71 ' @entity182
and yet there is no outcry from richer countries to end suffering there , he says
@entity71 raised more for @entity194 *victims* in three days than @entity3 in three years
@entity182 says celebrities like @entity7 can be powerful advocates for people in need
