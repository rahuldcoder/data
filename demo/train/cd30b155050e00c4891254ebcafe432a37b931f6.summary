-- @entity1 has dominated headlines for much of the last month as accusations of sexual assault pile up			1
more than a dozen women have accused @entity1 , many of whom say he drugged them first			1
their stories paint a starkly different picture of the man beloved by millions as dr. @entity11 -- the sweet , sweater - wearing father on the sitcom , " @entity13			2
" the 77 - year - old comedian has denied some of the allegations and refused to discuss others			1
he has never been prosecuted			2
here 's the latest on the controversy : what are the allegations against @entity1 ? at least 15 women are speaking out to various media outlets accusing @entity1 of sexual misconduct			1
they include 12 women who either @entity0 has spoken to or read court documents about , who have spoken on camera about their allegations or whose alleged attacks have been addressed by @entity1 's attorney			1
among the latest accusers is former supermodel @entity34			0
she told " @entity38 " that @entity1 assaulted her in 1982 after the two had dinner in @entity37			1
she alleges he gave her a pill and a glass of red wine shortly before she passed out			0
" the last thing i remember was @entity1 in a patchwork robe , dropping his robe and getting on top of me			1
and i remember a lot of pain , " she said			0
why are we talking about them now ? the stories of @entity1 's purported crimes have been around for about a decade , but they recently got new life when a comedian took aim at him and a social media stunt inviting fans to meme the comic went awry			1
in late october , @entity58 bluntly attacked what he perceived as @entity1 's " smuggest old black man public persona " by saying , " yeah , but you rape women , @entity1 , so turn the crazy down a couple notches			1
' i do n't curse onstage			0
' well , yeah , you 're ( a ) rapist , so i 'll take you saying lots of m * * * * * f * * * * * s on ' @entity1 : himself ' if you were n't a rapist			1
" earlier this month , @entity1 -- or whoever was in charge of his social media -- put out a challenge with a jovial picture of @entity1 in a cap : " go ahead			1
meme me ! # cosbymeme			0
" the internet immediately reacted			0
" @entity82 , have you seen my ... nevermind , found my raping hat ! " tweeted @entity84 over the cap picture			0
" my two favorite things ( -- ) @entity89 & rape , " tweeted @entity87 over a photo of @entity1 smiling			1
@entity1 's original tweet was quickly pulled from the @entity92 , which led to this conclusion from @entity94 : " if anyone is looking for a job , the social media manager position for @ @entity97 is about to open up			2
" what has @entity1 said about the allegations ? he 's been mostly mum			1
when an @entity103 reporter gave him a chance to deny the allegations , @entity1 provided an awkward moment of radio silence , refusing to answer the question			1
given the same chance by @entity110 , he offered no comment			0
when the interview concluded , he told a reporter that asking him about the allegations was a mark of low integrity and said he 'd be appreciative if that portion of the interview was " scuttled			2
" @entity1 offered an explanation for his silence friday , when he told @entity121 he was n't going to respond to " innuendos , " referring to the women 's accusations			1
" i know people are tired of me not saying anything , but a guy does n't have to answer to innuendos			0
people should fact - check			0
people should n't have to go through that and should n't answer to innuendos , " he told the newspaper in a backstage interview before his sellout performance at the @entity132 in @entity133			0
a lawyer for @entity1 has called the increasing number of claims of sexual assault against the legendary comedian " ridiculous " and said the media should stop airing " unsubstantiated , fantastical stories			1
" @entity142 said in a written statement sent to @entity0 that it defies common sense that " so many people would have said nothing , done nothing , and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years			0
" what 's been the fallout for him ? the accusations have taken their toll on @entity1 's earnings and reputation			1
@entity159 postponed a stand - up comedy special			0
it was filmed before a live audience in july and scheduled to premiere the day after @entity163			0
the company did not elaborate , issuing a statement that said only , " at this time we are postponing the launch of the new stand - up comedy special ' @entity1 77			2
' " @entity169 also decided against moving forward with a @entity1 project			2
the network said last week that it opted to stop developing the comedy show , which was billed this summer as a " classic , big extended - family sitcom " revolving around @entity1			2
" we can confirm that the @entity1 project is no longer in development , " @entity169 said			2
finally , @entity175 , one of the networks that have reruns of " @entity13 " in their lineups , quietly removed the sitcom from its programming schedule			0
@entity175 also deleted the sitcom page from its website			0
the channel did not respond to requests for comment about the disappearance of the show			0
@entity0 's @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
