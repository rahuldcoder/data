-- it was not what tennis star @entity2 needed to hear on the eve of his @entity6 title defense			1
having hired as his new coach former women 's no. 1 @entity8 , herself a winner on the hallowed grass courts , the @entity7 was looking forward to his usual home support over the next two weeks			1
instead , he has been forced to defend the @entity13 from criticism by @entity16 tennis legend @entity15			1
before @entity2 's success last year , @entity15 was the last @entity18 to win a @entity6 singles title when she triumphed at the @entity21 in 1976			1
but in an interview with the @entity16 @entity24 saturday , she said she thought his appointment of a female coach was " a joke " upon first hearing the news			1
" she 's done it a few times before with me			2
it does n't surprise me , " @entity2 told reporters sunday			2
@entity15 had previously criticized @entity2 for acting like " a drama queen " during a @entity35 match in 2012 as he struggled with a back injury			1
" the reason for working with @entity8 was about finding the right personality with the right experience to help me , " @entity2 continued			1
" i think she will help me			0
i 've really enjoyed the last 10 days i spent on the court with her			0
" and if it helps bring more female coaches into men 's sport -- and women 's sport -- that 's a good thing			2
because there 's absolutely no reason why someone like @entity8 ca n't help me			1
" @entity8 won the women 's singles title at @entity6 in 2006 and coached last year 's winner @entity55 to an unlikely success , though @entity15 described the 34 - year - old as having been " a little fragile mentally " during her career			1
@entity2 , nonetheless , will be looking to capitalize on @entity8 's expertise as he heads out on @entity60 monday to start his title defense against @entity62 of @entity63			1
the 27 - year - old has struggled for form in 2014 after undergoing surgery on a back injury nine months ago			0
he has failed to win a single match against a top - 10 opponent all year but will take confidence from his run to the @entity35 semifinals			0
with @entity8 on - board he hopes to become the first @entity73 to defend a @entity6 crown since the great @entity75 achieved the feat in 1936			1
their partnership did not have the most positive start , with @entity2 losing the second match of his title defense at @entity82 last week			1
despite the weight of history on his shoulders , @entity2 is keen to make the most of the experience			2
" i think tomorrow , i need to enjoy that moment when i walk back on the court , " he said			0
" but as soon as i start playing the match , it 's about trying to win			2
i do n't really want to go out on the court tomorrow and enjoy playing and then lose			0
" it 's time when i get on the court to start concentrating			2
not think about last year , concentrate on this year 's tournament and that 's it			2
" " i know there 's going to be pressure			0
that 's why today when i woke up there 's butterflies there			0
you 're one day away from starting the tournament			0
" but i hope that i 'm able to deal with it well			0
we 'll find out tomorrow			0
" elsewhere on @entity6 's opening day , top seed @entity110 takes on @entity112 of @entity113 while 2010 finalist @entity114 faces @entity115 of @entity116			1
in the women 's draw , no. 2 seed @entity117 of @entity119 will look to improve on her first - round exit at the @entity35 when she takes on @entity123 of @entity124			0
@entity124 's world no. 4 @entity125 opens her tournament against @entity128 of @entity116 while former no. 1 @entity129 takes on @entity131 's @entity130 in just her fifth @entity133 event of an injury - hit year			0
