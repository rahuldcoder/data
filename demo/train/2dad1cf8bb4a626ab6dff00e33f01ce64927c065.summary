-- a stolen war memorial that was at the center of a prominent legal battle over the display of religious symbols on public land was found this week tied to a fence post near @entity8			1
federal officials said on thursday the @entity10 , removed by vandals from its lonely @entity13 desert perch two years ago , was located 500 miles away in @entity14			1
" it was not easy to pick out identifying features to examine , but they are now confirming that it is in fact the @entity10 , " @entity15 , a spokeswoman with the @entity16 , said			1
the @entity23 cross was first erected on national parkland in 1934 to honor war dead and has been rebuilt several times over the years			2
easter services are held annually at the site			2
a federal judge in 2001 ordered the six - foot metal cross covered with plywood in response to a lawsuit claiming the symbol violated federal law prohibiting government preference for a particular religion			2
@entity37 , a former @entity38 employee , said in his suit the cross amounted to government endorsement of the @entity43 faith			1
an appeals court agreed , but the @entity45 ruled in 2010 it did not violate church - state separation and left it to lower courts to decide the circumstances for its display			1
after months of subsequent litigation , the @entity51 conveyed a one - acre piece of federal land where the cross stood to the @entity56			2
the cross received congressional recognition a decade ago -- shortly after the initial lawsuits were filed -- and its now known as the @entity60			0
a replacement cross will be erected sunday in a special rededication ceremony near the @entity16			0
the @entity63 was contacted this week by someone saying the stolen cross was tied to a fence post in @entity14			1
a note tied on it said authorities should be contacted			0
@entity69 , a local man who had built and erected the cross on @entity71 in the park , was notified by rangers to help identify it			0
the rangers and @entity69 finally agreed that the cross found in @entity63 was definitely the same one stolen in 2010 , @entity15 said			1
the @entity51 plans to return it to him			0
the cross itself was embedded in rock held in place by concrete			0
whoever removed the original would have had to climb up the steep outcropping , maneuvering around rattlesnakes that hide in the crevices			0
there have been no arrests or any indication who stole the original cross and how it would up in the @entity94 .			0
