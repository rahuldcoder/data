@entity0 -- the horrifying video of a @entity4 rebel leader apparently eating the heart of a dead government soldier , which has been circulating this week on the internet , has caused a storm of instantaneous outrage and disgust on social media such as @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
but the video , which human rights monitors say appears to be genuine and not a regime propaganda " plant , " may also inflict long - term political damage on the already challenged reputation and credibility of the @entity4 opposition , despite earnest condemnation of the alleged atrocity by the umbrella rebel organization , the @entity27			1
@entity28 said this week the video " appears to show " a commander of a rebel @entity4 brigade called the @entity30 mutilating the corpse of a regime opponent			1
" the figure in the video cuts the heart and liver out of the body and uses sectarian language to insult @entity49 , " a @entity28 statement said , adding : " at the end of the video [ the man ] is filmed putting the corpse 's heart into his mouth , as if he is taking a bite out of it			1
" the @entity28 statement said : " it is not known whether the @entity30 operates within the command structure of the @entity52			2
but the opposition @entity27 and the @entity52 leadership should take all possible steps to hold those responsible for war crimes accountable and prevent such abuses by anyone under their command ... any party with the power to do so should do all it can to keep weapons from reaching the brigade			1
" the last sentence is particularly pointed , given the accelerating debate in the @entity67 and @entity68 on whether to arm the rebels			1
the past two weeks has seen a concerted effort by @entity67 secretary of state @entity71 to rally support for an international summit on @entity4 to discuss a peace agreement and a transition of power from the regime led by president @entity78 to a new opposition - led government			1
when @entity81 travelled to @entity82 and @entity83 this week , he was pushing a similar agenda			0
in @entity87 talks with @entity88 , the @entity68 prime minister stressed the urgent need for a diplomatic settlement , but also reiterated that @entity68 ( like @entity91 ) was considering supplying weapons to the rebels after the @entity95 arms embargo expires at the end of this month			2
@entity98 officials have meanwhile indicated that the @entity67 is moving closer to providing weapons and other lethal assistance to the rebels			2
up until now , it has not done so , although the @entity103 has reportedly been involved in routing weapons supplied by @entity106 state sympathizers to the rebels			0
@entity81 also pressed his case in @entity109 , during a @entity111 meeting with @entity109 president @entity112			0
like @entity71 and @entity88 , the @entity68 see @entity114 's support for @entity78 as the key obstacle to ending the @entity4 civil war			1
but @entity112 continues to suspect that the western nations are pursuing regime change in @entity4 , and that they are looking for an excuse to intervene , as @entity120 did in @entity121 two years ago			2
he has refused to join calls for @entity78 to step down			0
upping the ante , @entity81 subsequently announced that @entity68 would double its non-lethal aid to the opposition over the next year and that it was looking at ways to provide more technical assistance to the rebels			1
the new humanitarian support of Â £ 30 million ( $ 46 million ) takes the @entity68 's total contribution to the @entity4 humanitarian crisis to Â £ 170 million , according to @entity132			1
all these well - laid diplomatic stratagems in @entity82 and @entity0 could be set at nought if alleged rebel atrocities , such as this week 's video , and other misdeeds turn international public opinion against the opposition			1
the rebels were already facing an uphill battle for support			0
@entity143 members of the @entity144 and right - wing commentators have long warned that elements of the rebel forces are linked to @entity148 , and that arming or otherwise supporting them would be to repeat the same mistake the @entity67 made when it armed the @entity151 mujahedeen in the 1980s ( when @entity151 was occupied by the @entity152 )			1
the mujahedeen mutated into the modern - day @entity153 , formed an alliance with the @entity156 in the 1990s , and have since turned the expertise they attained in defeating the @entity158 against @entity120 forces which entered the country after the 9/11 attacks			0
what leads a human being up to a grotesque act @entity112 has voiced similar fears in september 2012 , suggesting the @entity166 could be creating a monster in backing @entity169 groups against the @entity49 - led regime			0
@entity114 argues , in effect , that better the devil you know ( @entity78 ) than the devil you do n't ( an extremist @entity169 successor regime )			0
oddly , perhaps , these western voices of caution find themselves in de facto coalition with @entity180 and @entity181 in @entity182 , @entity184 allies of the @entity78 regime			0
meanwhile , a senior @entity187 official suggested recently that the rebels were guilty of using chemical weapons ( which they deny )			0
on top of all this , the opposition faces another question , bigger than all the others : can it win ? according to the @entity187 , the @entity4 civil war has claimed an estimated 80,000 lives so far , with millions more displaced or forced into foreign exile			1
the rebels control large tracts of territory , but they have failed to seize and hold major cities , and the balance of battlefield fortunes swings back and forward inconclusively			0
the regime has proved tenacious , resourceful and stubborn			0
@entity205 and his allies have nowhere to run			0
for them it is a fight to the death			0
the rebels , meanwhile , comprising myriad local groups and leaders , continue to lack strong central direction or agreement on what a @entity216 future might look like			2
it may be that a compromise deal on a new government including existing members of the regime and some rebel elements will ultimately prove the only way to end the war			2
this week 's video horror increases pressure to halt the bloodshed as quickly as possible -- even if that means some kind of patched - up deal , unpalatable , unsatisfactory and impermanent though it will undoubtedly be			2
opinion : why a man eats another man 's heart read more : @entity88 cautious on @entity4 , @entity68 ups urgency for peace read more : @entity239 may be @entity88 's key to solving @entity4 crisis the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			1

a video showing a @entity4 rebel eating the heart of a dead soldier circulated the internet
@entity244 : the video may " inflict long - term damage " on the @entity4 opposition 's reputation
@entity28 says war *criminals* should be *punished* and such abuses prevented
the @entity67 and @entity68 continue to debate whether to arm the rebels
