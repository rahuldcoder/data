-- an @entity2 government commission delivered a stunning blow to the sports - obsessed nation 's self - image , alleging that many professional athletes are using forbidden drugs often supplied by organized crime groups			1
the @entity10 said thursday that a yearlong investigation found evidence suggesting " widespread use " of prohibited substances and illicit drugs , some of them unapproved for human use , in a number of professional sports			1
" the findings are shocking , and they 'll disgust @entity2 sports fans , " justice minister @entity21 said at a news conference thursday			1
scientists , coaches and other staff have facilitated the use of the " performance and image enhancing drugs , " which organized crime entities are involved in distributing , the commission said in a report detailing its disturbing conclusions over more than 40 pages			1
the revelations are especially devastating for a nation where sports such as rugby , cricket and @entity2 football underpin identity and culture			1
" an understanding of sport is central to an understanding of @entity2 culture and @entity2 ' sense of who they are in the world , " according to the @entity52			2
" @entity2 's biggest cultural events are sporting events			2
" a grim start to 2013 for international sports the scandal follows a bleak few weeks for professional sports worldwide			0
last month , @entity60 cyclist @entity59 admitted to the use of performance enhancing drugs and blood doping during his multiple @entity66 victories			2
and on monday , @entity69 police officials said they were investigating hundreds of top soccer games over suspicions of match - fixing involving international crime syndicates			0
the @entity2 commission 's report did n't specify which sports are the focus of the doping allegations , citing legal restrictions			1
but it said that the current official doping statistics do n't reflect the scale of the problem			2
@entity84 said evidence suggests that the drug use does n't concern the " majority " of sports professionals , but that " we 're talking about multiple athletes across a number of codes			2
" in some cases , sports scientists and other staff are suspected of " orchestrating the doping of entire teams , " he said			2
concerns over organized crime the role of organized crime in the trade of the illicit substances , which include peptides and hormones , has caused particular concern			1
" it 's cheating , but it 's worse than that , " @entity84 said			0
" it 's cheating with the help of criminals			0
" criminal groups are taking advantage of legal loopholes under which the supply of certain substances prohibited by sporting authorities is n't classed as a crime even though the athletes who use the drugs face heavy bans , the commission says			1
" professional sport in @entity2 is highly vulnerable to organized criminal infiltration through legitimate business relationships with sports franchises and other associations , " the report said			1
" there is also increasing evidence of personal relationships of concern between professional athletes and organized criminal identities and groups , " it added			1
these connections " may have resulted in match fixing and the fraudulent manipulation of betting markets , " according to the @entity2 government			2
' the blackest day ' the government said it was responding by giving the @entity143 increased powers and resources to investigate the issues			0
it also said that if " persons of interest " refuse to cooperate with the authority 's investigations , they could face civil penalties			0
" do n't underestimate how much we know , " @entity84 said			0
" if you are involved in this , come forward before you get a knock at the door			0
" he added that as a result of the commission 's report , authorities believe " multiple potential criminal offenses have been committed , " and the relevant information has been passed onto police			0
the catalog of problems exposed by the commission 's report prompted expressions of dismay and disgust in @entity2			1
@entity172 , a former head of the anti-doping authority , summed up the mood			0
'' this is not a black day in @entity2 sport , this is the blackest day in @entity2 sport , " he told the @entity175			0
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity172 called the report a " wake - up call " for sports and suggested that other countries should take a look at their own sports programs to check for doping and corruption			1
" what is happening here and what has been uncovered here could easily happen in any other jurisdiction and any other country around the world , " he said			1
many prohibited substances in use nowadays can not be detected by existing drug testing programs , according to @entity172			0
" the game has changed , " he said			0
" it 's now about investigations , it 's about law enforcement , it 's about exactly what happened with @entity59			0

new : the problems could " easily happen " in other countries , an *ex-* anti-doping official says
an @entity2 commission finds evidence of " widespread use " of doping in sports
it says organized crime groups are involved in distributing the illicit drugs
the findings will " disgust @entity2 sports fans , " the justice minister says
