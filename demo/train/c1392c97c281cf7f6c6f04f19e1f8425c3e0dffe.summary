-- land of the free			0
bastion of mediocre @entity6 speeds			0
already getting clobbered by countries like @entity9 and @entity10 , the @entity7 is close to falling out of the top 10 nations in terms of internet - connection speeds , according to a new report			1
the @entity7 fell from 8th to 9th after being passed by @entity15 in the first quarter of this year , according to networking firm @entity18 's quarterly state of the @entity6 report			1
@entity18 handles about one - third of the world 's web traffic			1
the other countries with quicker web connections than the @entity7 ? @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and the @entity28			1
why @entity6 connections are fastest in @entity9 the slip comes despite average @entity7 speeds going up 27 % from the same time last year , according to @entity18			1
in some ways , the @entity7 is at a disadvantage when it comes to fast connections			1
its sprawling size and hefty population can make building efficient broadband networks a challenge			0
but critics argue that a relative lack of competition among service providers also hurts			0
@entity45 , a tech policy analyst and professor at @entity48 in @entity49 , argues that internet access should be a public utility like gas , electricity and water because it has become just as essential			0
in her book , " @entity55 : the @entity66 and @entity67 in the @entity68 , " she says a lack of regulation in the @entity7 has allowed a small number of companies to dominate the broadband market , meaning consumers have fewer choices and pay higher prices			2
" in @entity73 , when you move into an apartment , you have a choice of three or four providers selling you symmetric fiber access for $ 30 per month , and installation happens in one day , " @entity69 told @entity70 earlier this year			0
" that 's unthinkable in the @entity7			1
and the idea that the country that invented the internet ca n't get online is beyond my imagination			0
" @entity18 reported that the average web connection in the @entity7 was 8.6 megabits per second			2
@entity9 's average was 14.2 megabits per second			2
of course , some folks in the @entity7 have it better than others			2
in some regions of the country , residents still do n't even have basic connections to high - speed internet			1
but if you live or work in @entity94 , you 're in pretty good shape			0
average speeds there are 12.7 megabits per second -- meaning connections in the @entity94 are , on average , faster than @entity10 's			2
looking for speedy @entity6 elsewhere in the @entity7 ? @entity100 , @entity101 , the @entity102 and @entity103 round out the top five spots .			0
