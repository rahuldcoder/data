-- with so many advancements in mobile phone technology , it 's easy to dismiss most as insignificant			1
a mega-megapixel camera , a brighter screen and better apps are all good , but they 're hardly going to redefine your world			2
but with @entity10 you can expect significant life changes			1
a new generation of the cellular network -- already rolled out in many parts of @entity15 and the @entity16 -- @entity10 promises to supercharge mobile internet connections across the @entity18 and parts of @entity20 in the coming year			1
speed is the essence of @entity10			1
since global mobile networks began rolling out in the 1980s , a new generation of handsets has evolved roughly every decade			1
the latest , promising data speeds equivalent to a standard broadband internet connection , is considered the fourth -- hence 4g			1
although @entity10 coverage is still limited and , some critics argue , it may struggle to fulfil the ambitious claims of network operators , it is likely to make a difference to the millions of people who already channel great chunks of their lives through their mobile phones			1
some may argue none of this is a change for the better			0
with almost every aspect of our waking ( and , in some cases , sleeping ) lives slavishly conducted through our handsets , perhaps we are in danger of losing touch with the world beyond our small screens			2
others would say that by unloading life 's chores onto our phones , we will be free to spend more time doing what we want to do			2
whether for good or bad , @entity10 is already changing our world			1
here 's how : watching , not waiting whereas 3g networks offered slow video downloads or buffering - plagued live streams , @entity10 's high data speeds should mean feature - length movies accessed in a matter of minutes , or seamless live tv			1
high definition video phone calls are possible too			2
the implications of mobile tv growth are huge			2
as more people use their handsets as their primary viewing platform , moviemakers and tv producers may find themselves faced with the need to create shows that look good on smaller screens as advertisers move to mobile			1
consumers , however , would be advised to change their viewing habits with caution			0
video downloads are , and will continue to be , a major drain on data allowances			2
keeping up with the @entity82 could cost you fortune			0
pros : a cineplex in your pocket cons : a wasteland in your wallet connecting to the thingternet the first generation of mobile phones were so large and clunky they were known as carphones			1
most mobile calls were made from the comfort of a car because you needed a vehicle to carry around the heavy , ugly box of electronics that kept you connected			0
with the advent of @entity10 , you 're just as likely to be talking to your car as talking from it			1
this is a concept known as the " @entity105 , " a world wide web of everyday items that will soon see our contact books cluttered with the email addresses of washing machines , toasters and microwave ovens ( well , almost )			0
some everyday items , like @entity116 cable television boxes , are already hooked up to the internet , allowing users to program them remotely			0
it is predicted that most high - end electronic goods will soon be embedded with the ability to communicate via the internet			0
drivers will be able to defrost cars from the warmth of their bed			0
fridges will tell you whether you need to buy more milk			0
garden sprinklers will advise you whether the lawn needs a drink			0
such communications will flourish under @entity10 , as networks will offer the extra speed and capacity needed to cope with such an increase in electronic chatter			1
pros : control every aspect of life from your mobile cons : until the battery runs flat , leaving your home in digital disarray work , work , work when the first blackberry handsets were unleashed on unsuspecting employees over the last decade they revolutionized the way many of us work			1
suddenly , we were dealing with company emails on the train , on the bus and in the bath			0
thumbs suffered as people pounded out their replies on tiny @entity162 keypads			0
work - life balances suffered as the lines between professional and personal time became blurred			2
some relationships suffered as @entity167 were inevitably brought into marital beds			0
these days most of us have adapted to carrying around a portal to the office in our pockets			0
we might check them obsessively , but we 're no longer feverishly addicted to responding in real time			0
the arrival of @entity10 could shake things up again			1
with a mobile network that offers broadband speeds and capacity , it in theory becomes possible to carry out all manner of online activity on the hoof			2
secure connections through which employees can access data - heavy company software become possible			1
as does downloading or uploading huge data files and video conferencing			2
this will make life easier for workers whose job already takes them on the road			0
it will also unshackle many more from their desks			0
but it could also lead to a tricky transition period as millions of us adapt to a new world in which almost every aspect of office life can be lugged around in our laptops			0
pro : being able to work on the beach con : beach vacation ruined ! play , play , play even as @entity10 keeps us connected more closely to our work , it will also plug us into our play			1
whether you enjoy listening to music or engaging in multi-player computer combat , @entity10 should make that a seamless mobile experience via delay - free access to cloud storage or gaming servers			1
pros : mozart on the metro			0
alien annihilation on the number 8 bus			2
cons : work and play			1
our phones now own us			2
@entity226 or not 2g whether we like it or not , @entity10 is the future of mobile telecommunications ( at least until @entity229 comes along )			1
some people may insist that their old 1g or 2g handsets are all that they 'll ever need , but sadly they must soon bow to the inevitable			0
@entity10 phone operators have been able to increase network speeds by accessing a broader spectrum of transmission frequencies			1
these are expensive , with operators often entering highly competitive government auctions to secure a slice of radio bandwidth			0
as demand for @entity10 grows , networks will be looking to dedicate more frequencies to their coverage			1
this will eventually mean re-assigning the frequencies that currently support @entity246 and 2g devices			2
and so , after decades of service , millions of old lcd - screened handsets will be forced to beep their last sms			0
pros : recycling of an obsolete network that had little left to offer cons : @entity258 , undignified nd 2 a fone srvic dat gave us a nu lngwij & hz @entity261 millions of ppl ovr d years			0

next generation of phone networks will revolutionize communications with **faster** speeds
@entity10 connections will *drastically* increase the number of devices we control from our phones
**faster** data speeds will allow us to watch live tv , work and play more on the go
as more of our lives move onto our mobiles , we could become *over-reliant* on technology
