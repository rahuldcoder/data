@entity0 -- it 's not your imagination : our dysfunctional divided @entity5 is the least productive and least popular in recent history			1
some congressmen walk the halls like members of rival gangs			2
the simple job of reasoning together seems out of reach			2
a few good men and women -- like sens. @entity17 and @entity18 -- have decided to retire rather than subject themselves to this disheartening @entity20 theater			2
but what can we do to fix it ? the good news is that it does n't have to be this way			2
in the past , divided government presided over ambitious accomplishments like the @entity29 and the creation of the interstate highway system			2
@entity33 's accomplishments occurred while liberal @entity34 ran the @entity35			0
president @entity36 and then - speaker @entity37 did n't get along at all personally , but together they achieved welfare reform and balanced the budget			1
we need to change the culture of @entity43 to encourage more constructive and more civil behavior -- and that means changing the way the game is played			0
congressional reform might not sound all that sexy on the surface , but if you are frustrated with @entity43 's chronic dysfunction , you should care enough to help propose new solutions			0
that 's why it was heartening to see a @entity56 hearing by the @entity57 this week devoted to congressional reform			1
it had the overly officious name " raising the @entity60 : reform proposals for the 21st century			0
" but beneath the congressional - ese were some strikingly common sense ideas , some of which were first proposed by the organization @entity67 , which i helped co-found in 2010			0
it is a group of @entity77 , @entity69 and independents united in the belief that hyper - partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from solving the serious problems we face			0
here are three of the ideas proposed that could help heal the hyper - partisan gridlock afflicting @entity43			0
1 ) @entity81 , no pay -- this proposal would provide some personal incentive for senators and representatives do to something basic : pass a budget on time			1
but the sad fact is that it has been more than 1,000 days since @entity5 passed a joint budget resolution , which is why we keep playing chicken with a government shutdown over continuing resolutions			1
what 's worse is that this failure has become standard operating procedure			0
@entity5 has passed a budget on time only four times since 1952 and , for the past decade and a half , annual budgets have been an average of four months late			1
some members of @entity5 complain that having their $ 174,000 - a - year salary docked until they pass a budget would unfairly penalize them			1
but we need to apply some reasonable pressure to focus @entity5 ' collective mind			1
no budget , no pay is a good place to start			2
2 ) filibuster reform -- think back to the classic movie " @entity120 " and you 'll remember the filibuster scene , the high drama of watching @entity114 stand alone on the @entity56 floor trying to alert the nation to a miscarriage of justice			1
but the filibuster has turned in recent years from an extraordinary event to a routine parliamentary maneuver , designed to block legislation from ever receiving an up or down vote without a supermajority in favor			1
opinion : imagine a @entity5 that can do great things here 's a reality check			1
in the first 50 years of the convening of @entity5 , the filibuster was used 35 times			1
in the last two years , it has been used more than 100 times			0
the system is broken and being abused			0
" back in the 1960s , senators had to risk their bladder to filibuster , " rep. @entity139 , @entity140 , once told me			1
" now no senator has skin in the game			0
they just ask a staffer to file paperwork			0
" a simple procedural rule change to return the filibuster to its roots would mean an end to gridlock			2
3 ) @entity156 in 90 days -- since the @entity36 era , we 've seen an increase in @entity161 nominations getting blocked before they ever get a chance to have an up or down vote			1
in 2010 , sen. @entity165 , @entity166 , single - handedly blocked 70 nominations to get more spending for his state			0
in 2011 , more than 200 presidential appointments were left open , including the directorship of @entity172 and key positions at the @entity174 and @entity175 as well as federal judgeships			2
the democrats disgracefully blocked president @entity181 's judicial nominees , including @entity182			0
failing to confirm federal appointments leaves important offices unfilled and good people who want to serve their country stranded on the sidelines			0
the solution is a rule change that would give the @entity56 90 days to advise and consent -- but if they ca n't get their act together , the nominee would be automatically approved so government work can go on			1
opinion : what 's wrong with @entity5 ? it 's not big enough these are just a few congressional proposals that have been put forward			1
you should start proposing a few of your own			0
after all , no party , person or organization has a monopoly on good ideas			0
the key is to focus your frustration with @entity5 in a constructive direction			1
with their approval numbers at a historic low , who knows ? they just might feel enough pressure to start taking citizens ' advice			0
as sen. @entity17 said at the hearing : " we ca n't just hope and pray for a miraculous political awakening			1
there 's not going to be some spontaneous cultural change in @entity5			2
it 's got to be forced			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			2

@entity227 says a @entity56 hearing on reforming @entity5 was a positive step
he says members of @entity5 should n't be paid until they can pass a budget
the @entity56 should have to vote presidential appointees up or down in 90 days , he says
@entity227 : the old practice of a filibuster requiring continuous talk should be brought back
