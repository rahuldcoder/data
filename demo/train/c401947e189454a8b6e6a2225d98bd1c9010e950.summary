-- there is much debate in the world of golf as to whether four - time major winner @entity5 deserves his place in the game 's @entity7 , but journalist @entity9 is in no doubt			1
the deputy editor of @entity12 has told @entity13 there should be no doubt @entity5 's pedigree befits the accolade , calling the 41 - year - old one of the best players of his generation			1
there has been criticism in some quarters that given his age , @entity5 is too young to take his place in the pantheon of greats who have graced the sport despite a 20 - year top - level career			1
others have pointed to the fact that , incredibly , he has never held the top spot in golf 's world rankings			1
@entity36 finally comes of age with first @entity39 title but @entity9 disagrees and thinks the player -- known affectionately by fans as " @entity5 " -- still has a few major championships left in the tank			1
" @entity5 absolutely deserves to be in the @entity7			2
he 's one of the great players of his generation , " @entity9 said ahead of @entity5 's induction on monday			1
" he won four major championships in the era when one guy , namely @entity50 , won 14 of them			2
he was well seated at number two in the world for a quite a while			0
" the fact that he has been a stalwart of eight @entity57 teams , eight @entity59 teams , he has 40 ( @entity39 ) wins -- all these numbers are @entity7 - worthy material			1
" the debate over @entity5 's worthiness will be replicated in the coming years , according to @entity9 , given that @entity50 reigned supreme over the game for such a long period			1
" @entity50 has skewed things quite a bit , " he said			0
" if @entity50 was n't there @entity5 and many other players , like @entity69 , would have won more titles			1
" we 're going to run into several players now that will be @entity7 candidates in the next few years who were not number one in the world			2
" @entity5 is one of the first ones			0
if you look at the body of work for someone like @entity5 , he definitely gets in			0
the question mark will come soon			0
what happens with a player like @entity86 or @entity87 ? @entity88 : @entity90 's new genius superstar ? " you 're going to have to take into consideration that attaining the world number one ranking from the late 1990s through the late 2000s was going to be very difficult for anyone to do , yet they could be a fantastic golfer and @entity5 fits the bill			1
" @entity5 was in contention to win a fourth @entity102 title at @entity103 last month , but fell short after a disappointing final round			0
however , he can still boast one @entity39 victory this season -- at the @entity107 back in february			0
@entity9 believes @entity5 still has the game to challenge for more titles -- and more majors			2
" @entity5 showed on the @entity39 ( at @entity107 ) that he is capable of playing fantastic golf , " he said			2
" the fact his putting has been much , much better this season than it has been for a few seasons is a great sign and certainly when he gets back to @entity103 next year he could easily go for a fourth masters			0
he could have won this year			0
" i would not be the least bit surprised if @entity5 wins another major title , possibly a few more			0
