-- in the aftermath of a failed relationship , jilted lovers have been known to lash out by posting sexually explicit photos or videos of their exes online			1
called " revenge porn , " or the less - salacious " cyber revenge , " the trend has been around for years , spawning entire websites that profit off these images			1
but now , state laws could make this illegal			1
opinion : ' revenge porn ' should be a crime this week , the @entity16 is debating a new bill that would make it a misdemeanor for people to distribute sexually explicit photos or videos they 'd shot in order to cause others humiliation or distress			1
it has already passed the @entity27			0
a similar bill was under consideration in @entity30 this year that would have made the act a felony , but it failed to muster the votes to become law			1
@entity35 is the only state that already has such a law on the books			1
advocate @entity38 , a graduate student in @entity30 , began pushing for stronger laws after naked photos and videos of her were posted online that she had shared with an ex-boyfriend while they were together			2
the images went viral and were re-posted on hundreds of websites , along with identifying details such as her name , e-mail address and employer			0
@entity38 suspects her ex was responsible , although she told @entity0 that he has denied any involvement			0
she spent years fighting to get the images removed from various websites			0
a gray area the reason it was so difficult is that these acts of vengeance frequently fall into a gray legal area			1
in @entity63 , very few variations of revenge are already covered under state law			1
if a subject is under 18 , such an act is covered by child pornography laws			0
it 's already illegal to shoot a video or photograph secretly of someone without permission anywhere there 's a reasonable expectation of privacy -- in a bedroom or a store dressing room , for example , but not in a public park or on the street			1
however , these laws do n't apply in most " revenge porn " situations , where the injured party gave permission to be photographed or videotaped during happier times			1
there are cyberstalking statutes , but they require a pattern of behavior ( multiple offenses ) and implied threats that make the victim fear for his or her safety			2
uploading a single nude photo to embarrass an ex would n't apply			0
as a final recourse , the man or woman shown in an explicit video could pursue a civil case against their ex or the sites hosting the images , but those cases can be costly and difficult to win			0
the @entity63 bill , @entity109 255 , targets anyone who photographs or records a sexual image with consent and then " subsequently distributes the image taken , with the intent to cause serious emotional distress , and the other person suffers serious emotional distress			1
" under the new law , distributing these types of videos and photos would become a misdemeanor , punishable by up to six months in jail or a $ 1,000 fine for first violation			1
a second offense could result in a year in jail and a $ 2,000 fine			0
the perpetrator would not become a registered sex offender			0
" this is a very precisely drafted and narrowly drafted bill , " said @entity130 law professor @entity129			2
legal pitfalls the @entity63 bill is so narrow , in fact , that it does n't cover one of the more common revenge - porn situations : images originally shared through sexting			1
the law only applies when someone is the both the person who shoots the original image and the one who distributes it			2
if someone takes a photo of himself or herself , texts it to a girlfriend or boyfriend , and then the recipient later posts it , that act would n't be considered a crime under this legislation			0
critics such as the @entity153 have also expressed concerns about the bill , arguing such a law could have a negative impact on free speech			2
" it 's possible in extremely unusual situations that this kind of speech might have serious value -- you can imagine a political context or a video that reveals something criminal , " @entity129 said			2
there are other potential holes , such as when images are distributed for bragging rights or money instead of revenge			2
" it does require intent to cause serious emotional distress , " @entity129 said of the bill			0
" in certain situations , the reason people distribute this material is for money			0
" once an image is online it can spread quickly			0
the bitter ex could be charged with a crime , but getting websites to take down the image would still be a separate battle			0
the hope is that making distributing the images a crime will deter people from pursuing this type of revenge in the first place .			1

@entity63 debates a law that would make posting what 's known as " revenge porn " illegal
@entity35 is the only state with a similar law
distributing photos taken with permission falls into a gray legal area
