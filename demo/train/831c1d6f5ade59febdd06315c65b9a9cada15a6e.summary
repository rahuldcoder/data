-- it was in the cave of @entity3 that the prophet @entity4 received the first revelation of the @entity6			0
for rugby 's original wild child @entity7 , meeting a @entity10 family who lived with their five children in a one - bedroom flat in the south of @entity15 proved pivotal to his conversion to @entity17			1
the @entity19 's unshakeable belief in the @entity20 has proved to be the making of one of the island nation 's most gifted -- and controversial -- sports stars			1
" i was real close with them , and i saw how happy and content they were			1
and to see how they lived their lives , it was just simple , " @entity7 , a prodigious rugby talent , professional boxer and tattooed poster boy , tells @entity0 's human to @entity32			1
" one thing i 've learned over my career is that simplicity is the key			0
on the field , off as well			0
" " i 've become a true muslim , " added @entity7			1
" it 's giving me happiness			1
it 's made me become content as a man , and helped me to grow			1
i 've just got faith in it and it has definitely helped me become the man i am today			2
" the @entity7 of today does not visibly bear the scars of the 15 - year - old who was thrust into the unrelenting drinking culture of one of @entity54 's top rugby league clubs and shamed by national media after being caught in a compromising position with a model			1
a man who quit that scene , walking out on his contract to take up a lucrative offer to switch codes and join a @entity15 rugby union club -- requiring a substantial compensation payout			1
a man who rejected a reported record $ 5 million deal to stay with @entity67 and returned to @entity68 -- " the land of the long white cloud " -- to follow his dream of playing for the prestigious @entity72 , but found himself a fringe figure for 2011 's long - awaited @entity75 triumph on home soil			1
he 's been battered in a boxing ring , criticized for landing another big - money deal in @entity79 , and is now back in the sport where he 's most at home			2
and still controversy follows him			0
@entity75 mission @entity7 failed in his bid to become the first player to win the @entity75 in both union and league this month , as the @entity89 suffered a crushing defeat against @entity54 in the final to relinquish the title won four years ago			1
his mere presence in the squad for the tournament caused a storm , as he only made himself available the day after it was named -- reversing his earlier decision			0
it meant one unlucky player had to make way			2
" i thought i was doing a good thing , you know , staying true to myself , " says the 28 - year - old , who had just completed a triumphant return to @entity54 's @entity105 competition , winning his second title and subsequently deciding to extend what had initially been planned as a one - year stint with the @entity110 club			1
" then obviously there was a bit of a falling out , because one of the players was taken out of the squad , one of the young boys , and i just got absolutely hammered			0
" and it just made me think , you ca n't please everyone , you know ? if you go about trying to please everyone , there 's going to be endless struggles			2
" as long as you are happy with the man you see in the mirror , it 's all that counts i guess			2
" the battle within when @entity7 , who stands at 6 foot 4 inches and weighs in at 17 stone ( 108 kg ) , looks at himself in the mirror , it is surprising to hear him admit to vulnerability			1
" my toughest opponent is probably myself , i guess , mentally , " @entity7 says in his quiet voice , a gentle contrast to his powerful physique			1
stripped to his trunks in the boxing ring , you can see the rippling muscles and elaborate tattoos that have made him a pinup			0
" overcoming the mental struggles that you have out on the field , it 's been probably the biggest one for me			2
the reason i feel so mentally strong now is because of boxing and going through those tough times , " he adds			0
" i 've always had battles inside my head where i had to think where i was going to go			0
" fighting fit @entity7 is close friends with fellow muslim @entity157 , a former @entity159 star who became a boxing champion and has helped the @entity161 fulfill his ring ambitions			1
@entity7 ' last fight , back in february , earned him the little - known @entity165 title -- and some punishing blows from @entity168 journeyman @entity167 in a reduced 10 - round bout			1
" every sport has helped me excel in another			2
boxing has given me the mental strength to know that i can face anything on the field , without a doubt , " he reflects			0
that sixth fight is likely to be his last for a while , as he focuses on his rugby goals			2
@entity180 is a de facto religion in @entity89 , a country where the gods play with an oval ball and where institutionalized faith is losing ground with its general populace -- just over 50 % said they were @entity187 at the last completed census			1
he is back playing the sport that is perhaps closest to his heart -- his dad played it , and his mum 's father was a renowned coach in @entity194 , @entity89 's largest city , where he grew up			1
family means everything to him			0
his parents are separated , but he brought his father to @entity199 with him and sees his mum when he can			0
he has bought both of them houses			0
" my mother and my father were really big on manners , " @entity7 recalls			1
" almost to the point , you know , that when i got a bit older it made me a bit too shy , i never said anything out of turn			0
but they 've molded me to the person that i 've become			0
" he 's always been competitive -- even if it meant finding a short cut to finally beat his older brother ( " the biggest influence on my sporting career " ) in their regular childhood running races -- and he had been pegged as a future athletics champion before choosing rugby league			1
" i 've always loved sport			0
it 's funny , it 's all i ever thought i was good at			2
whatever sport was there , whatever ball i could pick up , whatever bat i could try , i 'd give it a crack			0
" finding simplicity @entity7 became the youngest player to be signed by an @entity105 team , winning his first grand final as an 18 - year - old with the @entity239 in 2004 , and was the youngest to represent @entity89 's @entity89 league side			1
" i grew up as a @entity187 , like many @entity241 do , and moving to @entity54 suddenly when i was 15 , i learned a lot about @entity244 faith , " he says			1
it was in @entity67 where , having fled @entity54 under threats of lawsuits from his jilted employer , his conversion to @entity17 was realized			0
having to adhere to the rule of @entity252 fasting has given him a new perspective on some of the things we take for granted			0
" when you do @entity252 and you go for the whole month , you 're that much more appreciative of being able to eat food and drink water -- that 's what it 's designed to do , " he says			2
but faith in the divine can only do so much , he says -- the rest is up to you			0
" to be the best you definitely have to have some @entity267 - given talents , but you also have to have the drive and the will and the dedication , " @entity7 explains			1
" simplicity is the key and i just try to keep things as simple as i can			0
but i never lose that one thing that 's got me there -- that 's drive , working hard , doing all the little things , ticking all the boxes			2
" the next challenge having switched allegiances so often , @entity7 finds himself having to work hard to earn acceptance -- which means trying to break some of his own habits			1
" i 'd like to be a bit more trusting , letting my guard down a little bit more			0
i 'm too serious sometimes , bro , as you can tell , " he acknowledges , before breaking into a big grin			0
" and in a team environment sometimes i 'm too intense , you know , sometimes i 've got to sit back and just relax			2
but it 's just how i 'm made			2
i 've always been competitive			0
" @entity7 admits he would be tempted to try another of rugby 's formats , @entity295 , which will make its @entity297 debut at @entity298			1
" that would be a dream come true			0
if i had the opportunity to give it a crack , i definitely would , " he says			0
" but there 's so much talent in @entity89 that it 's probably almost a distant dream at this stage			1
" whatever he decides to do after his new @entity110 deal ends next year -- he has hinted he will return to union ahead of the @entity308 -- it 's a fair bet that @entity7 will succeed			1
he has won titles almost everywhere he has been , and that has been driven by something deep inside him			0
" i just do n't want to fail , to be honest			0
i do n't want to let my family down , i do n't want to let myself down , " @entity7 admits , falling back into his earnest , serious tone			1
" that 's probably the biggest thing i fear			2
i 'm confident as a man , these days , and i know what i can achieve if i put my mind to it			0

@entity7 is hoping to be first player to win @entity324 in both rugby codes
he was the first @entity244 to play for @entity89 's @entity72 , winning 2011 world title
@entity7 is part of @entity331 team which has reached final of @entity333
he says becoming a @entity244 has helped him become content and more assured
