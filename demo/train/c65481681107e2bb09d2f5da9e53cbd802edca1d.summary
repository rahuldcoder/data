@entity0 -- in less than a month , the government may shut down			1
are you concerned yet ? confused ? well , if you 're not , you should be			0
at the center of complex negotiations in @entity0 is a sturdy little political device known as a continuing resolution , also called a " @entity12			1
" a continuing resolution ? a cr ? what in the heck is that ? good question			1
it is a legislative tool designed to keep the government running when the president and @entity21 ca n't get it together			1
by october 1 -- the deadline to keep funding everything in the government from the @entity26 to the @entity27 -- you 'll probably hear the term hundreds of times in news articles and out of the mouths of commentators and pundits			1
so let 's explain : q : what is a ' @entity12 ' ? a : it 's a legislative trick to pay the bills			0
the federal government 's fiscal year starts october 1			1
and the one key duty laid out in the @entity42 for @entity21 is to pass spending bills that fund the government			1
want a few billion for roads and bridges ? go see @entity21			0
that aircraft carrier needs a new paint job ? @entity21 is the place to go			0
sounds simple enough , but , in reality , the @entity50 and the @entity51 have n't done their job			0
in the past year , @entity21 has n't passed any of the 12 different spending bills that fund the much of the government , including defense programs , transportation projects and education			1
so when @entity21 does n't do its job , then it has to pass a continuing resolution , also referred to as a short - term spending bill or a stop - gap spending measure			1
it is a bill that sidesteps the lengthy budget process and funds the government for a specified period of time			1
it can last anywhere from a day to a year			0
crs are not an anomaly			0
they have been used 156 times between 1977 and 2011			0
and before 1977 , they were so common that @entity21 changed the start of the fiscal year from july to october to give lawmakers more time to pass the spending bills			1
that worked for a few years but then @entity21 settled into the new schedule and , like any high school student -- or journalist on deadline -- it procrastinated			0
so it had to revert back to the use of @entity85 to keep the government open			2
q : why shut down the government ? a : @entity90 , why ? and what does @entity12 have to do with a government shutdown ? often , a @entity12 is a simple legislative extension to accommodate lawmakers who do n't get their work done			1
it 's not designed to solve a debate embroiled in partisan politics			0
" typically these appropriations bills are not that partisan , " said @entity98 , vice president of @entity99			0
but that 's not always the case			0
@entity21 " recognizes one of their leverages is the power of the purse , " @entity98 said , adding that politicization of the budget process has become more polarized during the @entity106 administration			2
house speaker @entity112 has proposed a short - term spending bill that would fund the government until december 15			1
but then politics got in the way			0
this year , a core group of conservative @entity118 in the @entity50 wants to tie the entire $ 986 billion annual operating budget to a provision to defund the health care law known as @entity122			1
@entity50 @entity118 leaders delay vote on spending bill after conservatives rebel still , it 's rare that the threat of a government shutdown revolves around a partisan legislative poison pill			1
more often it 's about spending levels and the size of the government			1
that 's the track republicans usually take			2
since 2011 , they have used budget battles -- and taken the country to the edge of government shutdown -- to extract $ 2.3 trillion from federal spending			1
it 's worth it , they say , to rein in the first two years of the @entity106 administration 's spending spree , which included $ 830 billion in economic stimulus and an expensive new health care law			2
q : have we been here before ? @entity152			0
in 1995 and 1996 , president @entity153 battled a @entity118 - led @entity21 over spending levels ( his nemesis was then - speaker @entity156 )			2
it ended in a government shutdown -- for 28 days at the end of 1995 and beginning of 1996 -- and the @entity160 public largely blamed @entity21			1
following the shutdown , @entity153 gained an enormous political upper hand and @entity163 later lost his job as speaker			2
while politics seem particularly bad during these times , it 's important to remember that the government has n't actually shut down under this @entity21 or this president			2
q : so why is this so hard ? @entity152 passing spending bills is not easy			2
they can reflect the fundamental differences of governing philosophy			0
should we fund school lunches or more tanks ? aid to @entity180 or money for @entity182 ? it often takes intense negotiating between the two chambers of @entity21 and the president			2
but some in @entity21 complain that president @entity106 has not been the easiest guy to work with , especially when it comes to bridging partisan gaps			0
he rarely interacts with members of @entity21 , many say they do n't trust him and he has angered once - friends on the @entity194 with his recent positions on @entity196			0
@entity21 shifts its focus away from @entity196 resolution but the fight over the continuing resolution is just an extension of a deeper fight over the budget			1
much to the dismay of @entity118 , the @entity51 in recent years has failed to pass even a simple budget , a precursor to spending bills			1
and even though the @entity51 finally passed a budget -- it did so in march after the @entity50 acted -- leaders in both chambers could n't agree to start the process of combining their versions into a final bill			2
so the budget went nowhere			2
@entity214 , a former aide to senate majority leader @entity215 said the budget encapsulates @entity0			1
" the current budget process symbolizes all that is wrong with @entity21 right now			2
it 's broken and needs to be fixed , " he said			0
q : but they 're really not going to do this , are they ? a : that 's not clear			0
@entity50 @entity118 leaders are well aware of the political risks of threatening to shut down the government			2
they are reluctantly trying to avoid tying a short - term spending bill to defunding @entity122			1
not surprisingly , a @entity1 / @entity228 poll shows that @entity118 would again be blamed if the government does shut down			0
@entity1 poll : who would get blamed for government shutdown ? " only a third would consider president @entity106 responsible for a shutdown , with 51 % pointing a finger at the @entity118 - up from 40 % who felt that way earlier this year , " said @entity1 polling director @entity233			1
q : is n't this a really bad way to run the greatest democracy on @entity243 ? a : even if the continuing resolution was n't wrapped up in talks of politics and government shutdown , @entity98 argues that " it 's a terrible way to run government			1
" crs fund the government at the same level as the previous year			1
that means wasteful programs that need to be stopped or cut back are n't , and programs that need more money do n't get it			0
" one way to force government to have waste and inefficiency is to have a @entity12 , " @entity98 said			0
q : can it get any worse ? a : it could			0
the @entity12 is going to be one fight the @entity21 will have over the next couple of weeks			0
the next fight will be over the debt ceiling -- permitting the government to borrow more money to pay off its past spending debts			1
but that 's a different story for a different day			0
@entity1 political editor @entity272 contributed to this report			0

more talk of a government shutdown prevails in @entity0
common budget tool to fund the government , the " continuing resolution , " is becoming more *divisive*
some republicans are trying to tie government spending to defunding @entity122
experts say continuing resolutions are inefficient
