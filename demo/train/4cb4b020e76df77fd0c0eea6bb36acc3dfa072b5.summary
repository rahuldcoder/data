-- the @entity1 is all the rage for hobbyists in search of cheap , credit card - sized computers that can run a full @entity8 operating system			0
arduino boards have been around nearly a decade , meanwhile , powering robots and all sorts of other creative electronics projects			0
now , a project called @entity14 ( " you do " ) seeks to bring the best elements of @entity1 and @entity17 together into a single mini-pc that can run either @entity19 or @entity20			1
" with @entity14 , we want to combine the winning characteristics of @entity17 and @entity1 in one single board			1
the simplicity of @entity17 in managing sensors , combined with the flexibility of a microcomputer based on @entity34 are integrated in @entity14 , giving you a powerful prototyping board able to run @entity20 or @entity19 , " @entity14 project coordinator @entity24 , a @entity25 professor in electrical and computer engineering , said in a video on @entity14 's @entity29 page			1
@entity14 - based projects demonstrated in the video included a camera - equipped toy car controlled remotely with a tablet , programming education for kids , and a video game involving players running on equipment reminiscent of the @entity46			0
touchscreens and various other types of sensors can be connected to the @entity14			0
" want to build an led light - controller , an @entity51 reader , or a creative game controller ? @entity14 allows you to create any kind of project and share it with the community , " the @entity29 page states			2
" combining the flexibility of @entity17 with the power of @entity19 or @entity20 , you can create and update tons of stand - alone solutions without worrying about the linking between the two worlds and their wiring			1
" @entity14 's designers claim the board will have " the power of four @entity67 , " apparently in reference to the quad - core chip ( the @entity1 uses a single - core )			1
the @entity14 also has twice as much @entity71 ( @entity72 ) and @entity73 as opposed to the @entity74			0
the @entity1 has the @entity14 beat on price , though , with models selling for $ 25 or $ 35			2
the @entity14 was seeking $ 27,000 to jump start development of the computer			2
it has already received over $ 250,000 with 46 days of funding still to go			0

@entity14 seeks to combine the power of four @entity67 and @entity17 in a mini pc
it is intended to be a powerful prototyping board for *software* development and design
@entity14 will be able to run with either @entity19 or @entity20
the project has received $ *95,000* in six days on @entity29
