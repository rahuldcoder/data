-- as midnight approaches on december 31st , more than a few of us will crack open a bottle or two of champagne to help toast in the @entity6			2
many a glass of champagne will be raised during a toast to the @entity6			2
with a few choice facts about the bubbly stuff , you can look knowledgeable rather than just tipsy when you drain your flute			0
here are a few little nuggets you can share with fellow revelers			0
what exactly is champagne ? strictly speaking , champagne is a sparkling wine that comes from the @entity20 of northeastern @entity21			1
if it 's a bubbly wine from another region , it 's sparkling wine , not champagne			1
while many people use the term " champagne " generically for any sparkling wine , the @entity26 have maintained their legal right to call their wines champagne for over a century			1
the @entity33 , signed in 1891 established this rule , and the @entity35 reaffirmed it			0
the @entity36 helps protect this exclusivity now , although certain @entity39 producers can still generically use " champagne " on their labels if they were using the term before early 2006			2
how is champagne made ? sparkling wines can be made in a variety of ways , but traditional champagne comes to life by a process called the methode champenoise			1
@entity50 starts its life like any normal wine			1
the grapes are harvested , pressed , and allowed to undergo a primary fermentation			0
the acidic results of this process are then blended and bottled with a bit of yeast and sugar so it can undergo a secondary fermentation in the bottle			0
( it 's this secondary fermentation that gives champagne its bubbles			1
) this new yeast starts doing its work on the sugar , and then dies and becomes what 's known as lees			2
the bottles are then stored horizontally so the wine can " age on lees " for 15 months or more			2
after this aging , winemakers turn the bottles upside down so the lees can settle to the bottom			0
once the dead yeast has settled , producers open the bottles to remove the yeast , add a bit of sugar known as dosage to determine the sweetness of the champagne , and slip a cork onto the bottle			2
@entity0 : why is the drinking age 21 ? 3			0
what 's so special about the @entity20 ? several factors make the chardonnay , pinot noir , and pinot meunier grapes grown in the @entity20 particularly well suited for crafting delicious wines			1
the northern location makes it a bit cooler than @entity21 's other wine - growing regions , which gives the grapes the proper acidity for sparkling wine production			1
moreover , the porous , chalky soil of the area -- the result of large earthquakes millions of years ago -- aids in drainage			0
do i have to buy champagne to get good sparkling wine ? not at all			1
although many champagnes are delightful , most the world 's wine regions make tasty sparkling wines of their own			1
you can find highly regarded sparkling wines from @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , and other areas without shelling out big bucks for @entity124			1
speaking of @entity124 , who was this guy ? contrary to popular misconception , the namesake of the famous brand did n't invent champagne			2
but @entity124 , a @entity129 monk who worked as cellar master at an abbey near @entity132 during the 17th and 18th centuries , did have quite an impact on the champagne industry			2
in @entity124 's day , sparkling wine was n't a really sought - after beverage			1
in fact , the bubbles were considered to be something of a flaw , and early production methods made producing the wine somewhat dangerous			2
( @entity145 temperature controls could lead to fermentation starting again after the wine was in the bottle			0
if one bottle in a cellar exploded and had its cork shoot out , a chain reaction would start			0
) @entity124 helped standardize production methods to avoid these explosions , and he also added two safety features to his wines : thicker glass bottles that better withstood pressure and rope snare that helped keep corks in place			0
@entity0 : the men behind your favorite liquors 6			0
what 's the difference between brut and extra brut ? you 'll see these terms on champagne labels to describe how sweet the good stuff in the bottle is			1
as mentioned above , a bit of sugar known as dosage is added to the bottle right before it 's corked , and these terms describe exactly how much sugar went in			0
extra brut has less than six grams of sugar per liter added , while brut contains less than 15 grams of additional sugar per liter			1
several other classifications exist , but drier champagnes are more common			0
why do athletes spray each other with champagne after winning titles ? throughout its history , champagne has been a celebratory drink that 's made appearances at coronations of kings and the launching of ships			1
however , the bubbly - spraying throwdowns that now accompany athletic victories are a much more recent development			0
when @entity200 and @entity201 won the grueling 24 hours of @entity203 race in 1967 , they ascended the winner 's podium with a bottle of champagne in hand			1
@entity200 looked down and saw team owner @entity209 and @entity211 ceo @entity210 standing with some journalists and decided to have a bit of fun			0
@entity200 gave the bottle a shake and sprayed the crowd , and a new tradition was born			0
what 's sabrage ? after the @entity224 , members of @entity223 's cavalry decided that the normal pop - and - foam ritual of opening a bottle of champagne just was n't as visually impressive as it could be			1
they responded by popularizing a way of opening bottles using a sword			1
the technique , known as sabrage , involved holding a bottle at arm 's length while quickly running a saber down the bottle towards the neck			1
when the saber 's blade struck the glass lip just beneath the cork , the glass breaks , shooting off the cork and neck of the bottle while leaving the rest of the vessel intact			1
ceremonial " champagne swords " are available for just this purpose , and if you can pull off this trick , you 'll be the toast of your shindig			0
( be careful , though			0
a flying champagne cork is already you 'll - put - your - eye - out dangerous , and adding a ring of ragged broken glass to the equation does n't make the whole endeavor any safer			2
