-- estimates for the amount of thick sludge that gushed from a @entity5 coal plant last week have tripled to more than a billion gallons , as cleanup crews try to remove the goop from homes and railroads and halt its oozing into an adjacent river			1
@entity13 officials originally said the cleanup would take four to six weeks			1
now they say they are n't sure			2
the sludge , a byproduct of the ash from coal combustion , was contained at a retention site at the @entity13 's power plant in @entity21 , about 40 miles west of @entity22			1
the retention wall breached early monday , sending the sludge downhill and damaging 15 homes			1
all the residents were evacuated , and three homes were deemed uninhabitable , according to the @entity13			1
@entity13 's initial estimate for the spill was 1.8 million cubic yards or more than 360 million gallons of sludge			1
by friday , the estimate reached 5.4 million cubic yards or more than 1 billion gallons -- enough to fill 1,660 @entity33 - size swimming pools			0
environmental advocates say the ash contains concentrated levels of mercury and arsenic			1
the plant sits on a tributary of the @entity41 called the @entity42			1
at least 300 acres of land has been coated by the sludge , a bigger area than the 1989 @entity46			1
a spokesman for @entity13 , a federal corporation and the nation 's largest public power company , said the agency has never experienced a spill of this magnitude			1
" there 's a lot of ash there , " spokesman @entity53 said friday			0
" we are taking this very seriously			0
it is a big cleanup project , and we 're focused on it 24 hours a day			1
" initial @entity13 estimates put the cleanup timeline at four to six weeks , but @entity64 said the agency will no longer say how long it expects the effort to take			1
environmentalists say it could take months or even years to clean up the mess			0
video footage showed sludge as high as 6 feet , burying porches and garage doors			2
the slide also downed nearby power lines , though the @entity13 said power had been restored to the area			0
an estimated 78,000 cubic yards , or 15.7 million gallons , of sludge covered local railroad tracks and @entity80			2
@entity82 's backyard is covered with the sludge , though it did n't damage his house			2
" we have a terrible mess in our backyard , " he told @entity0 's " newsroom			0
" " i ca n't begin to imagine how much of an effort it is going to take to clean this mess up			0
it is incredible how much ash , dirt , earth , trees and debris is behind our house and then covering this neighborhood			0
" bulldozers and heavy machinery have been on the scene of the spill since monday , scooping up the thick gray goop that downed power lines , trees and broke a water main , forcing a temporary boil order on residents			2
footage from the @entity42 , a popular fishing site , reveals piles of dead fish on its banks			0
@entity13 said that has nothing to do with the toxicity of the sludge			2
" what happened -- when you have a surge of ash , that created a wave to push the fish up and onto land , " @entity64 said			0
" when the water receded , there were dead fish			0
they were n't killed by any toxic chemicals , they were stranded by the wave			0
" he noted that water quality tests from the nearby water treatment facility have shown that the water from the river intake meets federal and state guidelines for potable water			2
but critics of the coal operation remain concerned about the long - term effects of the spill			1
" the early results are showing that it is not in the drinking water yet , but it is a fluid situation and the stuff is still not properly contained and concentrations can change over time , " said @entity142 of @entity143			0
he said people can still be exposed as the sludge dries and goes airborne in dust			2
he said the spill underscores the need for the federal @entity154 to regulate the containment of coal ash and accused @entity13 of underplaying the @entity41 spill			1
" you have acute problems we are dealing with today , but we 'll have chronic problems for a long time , " @entity142 said			0
" this whole area has been devastated environmentally			0
" @entity165 environmentalists compare the mess to another spill eight years ago in eastern @entity168 , where the bottom of a coal sludge impoundment owned by @entity171 broke into an abandoned underground mine , oozing more than 300 million gallons of coal waste into tributaries			1
the water supply for more than 25,000 residents was contaminated , and aquatic life in the area perished			0
it took months to clean up the spill			2
" if the estimates are correct , this spill is 1Â½ times bigger , " said @entity181 , an environmental advocate with the @entity183 , a traveling program that explains the impact of an extreme form of mining			1
@entity0 's @entity190 contributed to this report .			0

15 homes damaged , three called uninhabitable
