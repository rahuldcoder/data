on the @entity4 - @entity3 border @entity0 is today among @entity6 's most wanted women			1
the widow of @entity9 supermarket gunman @entity8 , she is believed to have disappeared into @entity3 in the days leading up to the shootings in @entity9			2
since the attacks , security officials have been scrambling to trace her movements			0
but on january 2 , a week before her name was internationally known , security camera footage shows that @entity0 and a male companion cleared customs with ease at @entity21 's secondary airport			1
something raised a red flag with @entity4 authorities , however , and the two were placed under surveillance			2
they checked into the @entity28 on the @entity30 side of @entity21			0
they were monitored for a couple of days , but after engaging in what was described as " touristic " activities , the surveillance stopped			0
female terror suspect more radical than boyfriend ? following the @entity9 attacks , @entity4 officials alerted @entity41 authorities that they had already gathered some intelligence on @entity0			1
the @entity41 provided the @entity4 with phone numbers that allowed them further to track her movements			2
@entity0 's last known location is the city of @entity48 , along the @entity4 - @entity3 border			1
@entity48 has become a key hub for transit into @entity3			1
the touristic city has seen its population swell due to the influx of refugees from @entity3 's civil war , and just about anyone can blend into the chaotic streets			1
from here , those seeking to enter @entity3 can find plenty of routes for the next leg of their journey			2
@entity1 spoke to two men in a town close to the border , both of whom are professional people smugglers			0
over the last few months , the @entity4 military has really cracked down on the practice , one said , his head wrapped in a scarf to hide his identity			2
but there are always security breaches and alternate routes to be exploited			0
the second man , his face obscured by a black cloth , told @entity1 that a woman dressed all in black paid him some two to three times the going rate to get into @entity3 -- right around when @entity4 authorities believe @entity0 slipped into the country			1
" she said ' i will give you 100 lira just get me to @entity3 , ' " he recalled			2
" she was entirely covered in black , like i am now			0
" it was the first time since the war in @entity3 began in 2011 that either of them had taken a woman across on her own			1
the smuggler said the woman was of medium build , and guessed her age to be -- like @entity0 -- in her mid- 20s			1
she spoke classical @entity99 and did not have a @entity3 accent			0
that , he claimed , is all he knows			0
" i saw the 100 lira and i did not ask anything , " he told @entity1			0
what the woman paid is roughly $ 42			0
on the back of a motorcycle , they headed down a dusty border road dotted with potential illegal crossing points			0
the @entity4 military stopped the @entity1 team before it could reach the area where the man said the woman crossed into @entity3			1
there is no way of knowing if she was @entity0			0
but within an hour of her transaction with the smuggler , the woman covered in black was in @entity3 .			1

@entity0 's last known location is the city of @entity48 , by the @entity4 - @entity3 border
