@entity0 -- survivors of the oil rig explosion april 20 that triggered an underwater oil gusher in the @entity5 , along with the father of a man who died in the blast , urged members of a @entity11 committee thursday to hold @entity12 and @entity13 accountable for the incident			1
" please believe me , no amount of money will ever compensate us for @entity19 's loss , " said @entity15 , a @entity16 , @entity17 , attorney whose son , 28 - year - old engineer @entity19 , died in the explosion on the @entity21 off the coast of @entity17			1
but payment of damages by wrongdoers is the only means we have in this country to make things right			2
" two employees of rig owner @entity12 , meanwhile , accused the company of putting profits above lives and cutting back on safety and employees leading up to the explosion			1
when workers complained of needing more help , " they just kept telling us they 'd see what they could do , " said engineer @entity43 , 50 , of @entity44 , @entity0			1
@entity43 suffered head and leg injuries in the explosion and said he now struggles with short - term memory loss and post-traumatic stress disorder			1
employee @entity53 told committee members that the explosion " was hardly the first thing to go wrong " on the rig			1
both men described a horrific scene on board the @entity21 the night of april 20 , with people crying and screaming for help as others scrambled for safety			1
" i was pretty certain i was going to die , " @entity53 said			2
after making it onto a lifeboat , being rescued by the @entity68 and reaching land , some 28 hours after the explosion , survivors " were lined up and made to take a drug test " before being allowed to leave or call their families , @entity53 said			1
@entity12 asked him to a sign a document -- without his attorney present -- saying he was not injured in the blast in exchange for $ 5,000 for the loss of his personal possessions , he said			1
he refused to sign the portion saying he was uninjured , he said , because even though he did not require medical treatment at the time , he must see a doctor for effects of smoke inhalation and is also dealing with mental and emotional aftereffects			1
legal representatives for both @entity13 and @entity12 said the companies are making payment of claims a priority			1
" we are going to pay all legitimate claims , " said @entity94 , vice president for resources for @entity13 , who is handling claims against the company			2
" we realize that we 're going to be judged by our response to this spill , and we 're going to pay for all damage to people , to governments , to the community			0
" @entity13 has already paid out some $ 37 million in claims , he said , and has opened claim centers in @entity110 states			0
but @entity19 argued that the federal death on the @entity112 unreasonably limits the damages surviving family members can receive			0
he said the situation makes even less sense considering it was modified after the crash of @entity118 in 1996 to help the families of air crash victims recover damages			0
in one of the last pictures taken of @entity19 , he was giving his 2 - year - old son , @entity124 , his first golf lesson			0
his second son , @entity126 , was born two weeks ago , with his father represented in the delivery room by a family photo			2
" there 's nothing in the @entity112 that can compensate the loss of a golf teacher , " his father told @entity1 after the hearing			2
" his sons are not going to have someone to teach them to give a man a firm handshake and look them in the eye			0
" he said his son 's wife , @entity146 , " can not recover for the loss of the love of her life			0
" " the loss of @entity19 's income is the last thing @entity146 grieves for , " he told @entity148			0
" when @entity146 tells her boys about their dad , she is not going to show them a pay stub			0
" but under the current law , he said , that is all she and the older son are entitled to , and the baby may be entitled to nothing , because he was born after his father died			2
@entity19 said allowing punitive damages against companies like @entity13 and @entity12 is " the only way they may learn			1
" @entity165 attorney general @entity164 told committee members that @entity12 has already filed a limitation action in preparation for lawsuits , and @entity13 has filed to consolidate such suits			1
states are concerned they will be pulled into a class - action suit where they will be treated like any other plaintiff			0
@entity165 wants its legal issue debated in state court , not in courts somewhere else , he said			0
@entity12 attorney @entity179 said the majority of about 120 suits filed against the company thus far are class - action suits			1
multiple lawsuits are confusing and can lead to disparate treatment for plaintiffs , she said			0
the company filed its limitation action for several reasons , she said			2
" we believe that it is important to have a central venue for these actions and to maintain a degree of continuity and consistency in awards to plaintiffs that would not be possible if lawsuits go forward in courts throughout five states in various state and federal courts			0
" asked by rep. @entity204 , @entity205 , about @entity53 's claims he was asked to sign a document , @entity179 said a man " who is not a lawyer " met with @entity12 employees in the days after the explosion and gave them a $ 5,000 check for their possessions			1
" no release was signed , " she said			0
" no one has been asked to , or has , signed a release of liability , " she said			0
@entity1 's @entity219 contributed to this report .			0
