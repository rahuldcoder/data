-- the @entity1 on wednesday reinforced the nation 's belief in freedom and its constitutional traditions with a ruling that upheld my challenge to a section of the federal election campaign law that restricted citizens ' rights to express their views			1
that outcome , i believe , will become part of a successful attack on the numbing political status quo in @entity18 and encourage activists across the nation who have fresh ideas to improve how our government operates			2
i am grass - roots proof that citizens retain some influence and — with determination — can achieve positive change			1
i hardly suspected such an outcome in late 2011 when i launched my legal challenge			0
my target was the overall limits on an individual 's fully disclosed contributions to federal candidates , national political parties and political action committees			1
i did not challenge the specific contribution limits in each category			1
this case is not about limits on the amount of money you may contribute to an individual candidate			2
it is about your right to contribute that amount to as many candidates as you choose			0
allowing individuals to donate to as many candidates as they wish would draw contributions away from pacs and bring money directly to candidates , giving underdog candidates a fair chance in the political arena			2
like most @entity59 , i had little knowledge of these campaign laws — including how the @entity18 insiders passed them , interpreted them and enforced them			0
i have spent my adult life as an electrical engineer in the @entity68 , @entity69 , area where i grew up and eventually created a small business that has fewer than two dozen employees			0
i was too busy for politics until five years ago , at age 42 , when i joined many other @entity59 who were disenchanted by what they saw in @entity18 and decided to take action			0
@entity77 : with ruling , money talks even louder in politics the core belief that has driven my political activity and my legal challenge has been my full embrace of the @entity85 's guarantee of free speech			1
during my political science course as a freshman at @entity88 , i learned about the @entity1 's landmark 1976 decision that political activity was entitled to that protection			1
all the sitting justices joined , at least in part , that @entity96 vs. @entity98 ruling , which found that free and open debate — including unlimited campaign expenditures — is " integral to the operation of the system of government established by our @entity104			2
" this week 's ruling by chief justice @entity107 restated many of those vital national values			0
excessive campaign finance restrictions , he wrote , impermissibly inject the government " into the debate over who should govern			0
" he pointedly added , " and those who govern should be the last people to help decide who should govern			0
" it does n't take a political scientist to conclude that congressional incumbents have been the chief beneficiaries of these restrictions			2
even with the overwhelming public unhappiness with @entity123 , they typically have re-election rates of roughly 95 %			0
a key factor is that the current system makes it much more difficult for challengers to raise money			1
in most cases , they simply lack the incumbents ' access to tap into @entity18 's deep - pocketed special interests			1
this status quo , which has been created chiefly by the so - called political reformers , has had the perverse — but seemingly intended — effect of protecting incumbents in both parties , except for infrequent waves of voter disgust			1
my objective is to assist challengers in raising funds , and to encourage smarter political ideas			1
i clearly am not one of those special interests , nor am i one of the billionaires who have become political targets			1
friends call me " your neighbor @entity151			0
" with other activists , i believe that we can change our politics and draw it closer to our communities			2
having become part of public life , i have learned that political conflict and rhetoric sometimes can be hard - ball			0
but i have made a point of fully respecting other players , even if they criticize me			0
my support of the @entity85 in this case helps extend those rights to everybody			0
with the @entity1 's encouragement , i hope the nation is prepared for a robust and wide - open public debate to address our problems .			1
