according to arrest affidavits filed in the case , 67 - year - old @entity39 and @entity32 , 73 , agreed to buy a silencer , a bomb and parts to convert a semi-automatic rifle to a fully automatic machine gun from an undercover agent			1
meanwhile , 65 - year - old @entity50 and 68 - year - old @entity51 worked to obtain castor beans and produce ricin , an @entity49 agent states in the documents			2
" while many are focused on the threat posed by international violent extremists , this case demonstrates that we must also remain vigilant in protecting our country from citizens within our own borders who threaten our safety and security , " @entity26 attorney @entity55 said in a written statement announcing the arrests			2
the affidavits do n't identify the " known militia organization " of which @entity49 agents say the men are a part			1
but according to the documents , they talked about spreading ricin across several cities at once , including @entity78 , @entity0 , @entity79 and @entity80 , @entity81			2
during an april meeting at his home , @entity32 allegedly told participants he had a " bucket list " of politicians , government officials , corporate leaders and media figures he said should be targeted to " make the country right again			2
" " i could shoot @entity91 and @entity20 all day long			1
all the judges and the @entity17 and the attorneys and prosecutors , " the affidavit quotes @entity32 as saying			1
@entity51 allegedly said he wanted to make 10 pounds of ricin for distribution			2
" dump that little ( unintelligible ) that 's all you got ta do is lay it in the damn road , the cars are gon na spread it , " the affidavit quotes him as saying			1
according to one of the affidavits , @entity51 formerly worked for a contractor doing " maintenance type services " at the @entity107			2
@entity51 also spoke of an even deadlier substance , " worse than anthrax , " but the group would need financial backing to produce it , according to the affidavit			2
the document states a castor bean provided to the informant by @entity50 and @entity51 tested positive for ricin			0
the @entity26 @entity118 verified @entity50 formerly worked at the @entity119 as a lab technician , an affidavit says			0

in a phone call , he also said the four began physical training to prepare for their plans , the affidavit states			0
@entity130 told @entity132 affiliate @entity131 that the investigation began earlier this year when an informant talked with the @entity49 about conversations he had overheard			0
the informant taped conversations with the four suspects and an undercover agent began talking with them , @entity130 said			1
she said the defendants had taken " substantial steps " in the alleged plot			0
" they had some of the ( ricin ) ingredients that were necessary but not all the ingredients , " she said			0
" it 's really important for the public to know and be assured that the @entity49 was on top of this and they were monitoring this every step of the way			0
" discussions on how to spread the ricin included driving down an interstate highway and allowing it come out the window , @entity130 told @entity131			0
according to one affidavit , the confidential informant is on bond for pending felony state charges			0
an @entity49 polygrapher determined the individual " gave less than truthful responses concerning the activities of the militia group			0
