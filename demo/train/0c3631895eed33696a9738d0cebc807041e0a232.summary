six student survivors testified monday at a court in their hometown of @entity40			1
their identities can not be published			0
the second student to testify said she heard an announcement asking those on board to put on life jackets and remain on the ferry			2
the student told the court that she did not hear any announcement from the ship or coast guards telling passengers to leave the ship			2
she said the ferry listed to the extent that the windows were on the ground and the door was on the ceiling in her cabin			2
as water came in , their class leader suggested that because they were in life jackets they could float to the door			0
they eventually were able to escape , walking on the hallway			0
the fifth student said that she considered trying to escape once the ferry began listing , but did not because she heard the announcement asking passengers to stay put			2
she said the lights then went out and she saw that the window was completely covered in water			0
she escaped when the water rose and she was able to float to the door			0
students already in the hallway dragged her outside			2
another student described the scene in the hallway as she lined up to exit			0
she said a strong current was in the water and about half the students with her were swept away			0
the student said she could see coast guards near the emergency exit , but she never saw them enter the ship			0
after the students ' testimony , the court heard from another survivor , who was in a wheelchair and wearing a hospital gown			0
he described how he had managed to get himself near the information desk when the ferry had started to tilt			0
the man said the students had been panicking and a female crew member announced that " everyone should stay put , the ferry is in danger , and that the rescue will be there soon			1
" he said he thought she was trying to calm the students			0
the man said that he had asked the crew member to contact the captain , but that the captain had not responded when she tried to reach him on a walkie - talkie the female crew member announced again that everyone should stay put and that help would arrive soon , he said , and later told students to put on their life jackets the man broke down crying as he described watching people slide as the boat tilted about 40 or 50 degrees			1
tense trial opening in june the students arrived at the @entity40 courthouse under a heavy police presence monday , with lines of officers surrounding the building			1
at the trial 's opening june 10 in @entity139 , victims ' relatives yelled and screamed at those on trial upon seeing them for the first time			1
investigators have said a vast amount of cargo -- more than double the ferry 's limit -- and the failure to tie it down properly were partly responsible for the @entity3 's capsizing			1
at the trial 's opening , the prosecution accused the ferry 's owner , @entity157 , of putting profit above all else by overloading the @entity3			1
it said the cargo was badly secured , meaning the crew was also culpable			0
prosecutors said the crew members could have carried out a far more effective rescue operation			1
in june , @entity17 's attorney told the court that the captain had been helming the ship for only six days , he was the last rescued of all the crew members and he was n't in charge of loading cargo			1
if convicted of murder , @entity17 and his fellow accused could face the death penalty , although it has been nearly two decades since capital punishment was carried out in @entity8			1
