-- when your grandmother is one of the most famous cosmetics moguls in history , it might put a little pressure on you to succeed			2
but for @entity8 , the 44 - year - old granddaughter of @entity10 , who founded the eponymous make - up company , the legacy has been an inspiration rather than a burden			1
@entity10 worked her way up through the ranks of the billion - dollar family company for 25 years to the position of style and image director			1

@entity0 : what is it like to live up to the heritage of @entity10 ? @entity8 : it is an amazing legacy and i think she is always looking down at me very proud			1
she taught me the importance of excellence ; so has my uncle , my cousin and my aunt , everyone who works at the company as a family member has really re-emphasized the importance of excellence and perfection			0
@entity0 : you had a very international upbringing , growing up in @entity60 , @entity61 , where your father was the @entity63 ambassador , then moving to @entity64			0
how did that shape who you are today ? @entity8 : it shaped a tremendous amount of my vision , style and taste			1

it 's the idea of beauty from all over the world			0
@entity0 : are you a detail - oriented person ? @entity8 : i 'm very detail - oriented , which is good and bad			1
because i will wake up in the middle of the night , thinking about something or seeing a mistake , thinking about it and i immediately send an email -- i 'm very focused on details			0
but i think that is really important because it is my name on that product , and i think it should be the best it can possibly be			0
@entity0 : what has been the biggest mistake you have made in your career and how did you overcome it ? @entity8 : i think it is very important to learn to say " no.

" i launched products and campaigns which i thought might bring in new consumers but in reality would make the existing @entity10 one maybe discouraged			1
@entity0 : in your business schedule you are balancing work and family			0
how do you find time and get inspired ? @entity8 : i think you can get inspiration from anything			2
it can be a walk on the beach , it can be a moment with your children , and also the @entity152 has been a wonderful source for inspiration			0
