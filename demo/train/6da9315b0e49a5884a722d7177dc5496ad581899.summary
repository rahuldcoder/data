-- amongst the clouds of dust kicked up from the desert by the hundreds of new arrivals who pitch up every day at the @entity6 -- just 15 kilometers from the @entity9 / @entity8 border -- @entity10 is planning her next lesson			1
the twenty - six - year old is short , hair tied back , her thick - rimmed glasses sitting wonkyly at the end of her nose			2
she is standing outside a large marquee where a group of @entity8 men is being taught the basics of soccer coaching			2
" ' football , " she tells @entity0 , her eyes moving to a group of young children nearby , screeching with laughter as they kick a football around on a sand pitch , " we all speak football			0
" @entity10 is a star for the @entity9 women 's national team , who are preparing for a tournament that could see the kingdom qualify for the @entity36 finals for the first time in their history			1
but , for now , she has more important work to do			0
she coaches soccer for @entity8 girls and young women who have fled the horrors of civil war and found themselves in what has become one of the biggest refugee camps in the world			2
the sound of a child 's laughter is rare in @entity6			1
since the start of the @entity8 civil war -- the conflict marked its third anniversary in march -- this tiny hamlet has been transformed into one of the biggest cities in the country			0
as many as 150,000 people live here now			2
hundreds come every day , sometimes more , sometimes less , depending on the brutality of the fighting just a few kilometers away			0
they have built a life of semi-permanence			0
according to the @entity68 there are now close to 700 shops in the camp and nearly 60 mosques			2
you can buy cable tv from one of the many tents set up to supply the growing population			0
there 's a wedding cake shop , a place to buy wedding dresses and even a pet shop			2
it costs $ 1.6 billion a year to run @entity6 , but the human cost is immeasurable			1
almost every player @entity10 coaches says they have been confronted with the unimaginable : bombings , the death of entire families , assault , rape			1
" the main thing we can work on is self - confidence , " @entity10 explains of the fragile emotional and physical state her players arrive in			1
" to bring those people here and tell them they can achieve whatever they want			2
we have to make them resilient because they were suffering in @entity8			0
" dealing with the emotional scars of a civil war is a tough job , but there is also the added obstacle of social conservatism to overcome			0
almost everyone at @entity6 has come from @entity8 's southern , rural , conservative @entity109 population			1
young girls have simply never played football in that environment			0
the biggest issue in such a sprawling , impersonal camp , according to @entity10 , is privacy			1
" they have all come from conservative communities and are not allowed to play in public so we have to make sure that they are hiding all the time , " she says			0
" it 's a really big problem here			2
because you can see the camp it 's open from all angles so we have to find a safe place for them to play			1
we have to find private places just for the girls to come			0
" in private , away from the gaze of men , @entity10 works with her players , but it takes time for her to earn their trust			1
" the women in @entity6 have no idea about sport at all , " she explains			1
" in the first lecture we say : ' we are national team players			1
we have come here to talk about sport			0
' they ask : ' what do you mean ? what is sport ? ' " it is not an uncommon question in the region			0
while women 's soccer has boomed around the world , the game in the @entity152 has been fraught with religious and cultural opposition over the past decade			1
in @entity158 a nascent women 's national team was effectively banned in 2007 after lawmakers decided it was ' un-islamic ' for women to play soccer			1
the @entity164 women 's national team had to fight social conservatism within its own communities to build a mixed team of @entity169 and @entity170 players			1
@entity171 still has no women 's team			1
the @entity9 team has only existed since 2005 and has been backed with money and support from @entity177 , the young half - brother of the king , who was recently elected as a vice-president on @entity181 's powerful executive committee			1
fifteen new training centers for young girls have been built and prince @entity184 has been instrumental in pushing through a rule change that allows @entity169 women to wear a modified hijab to cover their hair during @entity181 matches			0
originally they had been prevented from doing so on the grounds that the hijab was a religious symbol			0
but the change could revolutionize the game in the @entity152 and open soccer to millions of women who would otherwise be prevented from playing			0
in the past few years alone national women 's teams have been set up in the @entity200 , @entity201 and now , finally , @entity158 too			1
the greatest success story , though , has been the @entity9 national team with @entity10 , who cites @entity205 @entity36 winner @entity204 as her inspiration , in the heart of midfield " i 'm from @entity209 and started playing when when i was 13 , " she recalls			1
" in @entity9 we do n't have the same problems anymore as say with the @entity164			2
" we do n't have the same social problems as they have			0
but we used to , when we started in the past			0
" in just eight years the @entity9 team has gone from nothing to qualifying for the @entity216			1
@entity10 scored a hat trick in a world record 21 - 0 victory over @entity158 in one qualification match			2
that tournament takes place in may and if @entity9 reach the semi-finals they will qualify for the @entity36 , the first time a team from the region will have ever made it			1
" i play as a central midfielder so it was fun to score , " she says , a little embarrassed at the huge scoreline			0
" we have to look at new teams like @entity201 and @entity158 and support them			0
but , " she adds , laughing now , " we needed the 20 goals as @entity233 were in the same group and they scored eighteen ! " for prince @entity184 , the success of the team on the pitch vindicates an investment in the women 's game that few others in the region were willing to make			1
" our girls have qualified for the @entity216 , the first team ever from @entity245 and that 's down to them and the investment we 've put in , " he explains of @entity9 's recent success on the pitch			1
" we chose a coach from @entity250 , bearing in mind they are @entity36 champions , and we hope they can make it to the @entity36			0
" the @entity6 project is a collaboration between the @entity257 , set up by prince @entity184 , and @entity258 , @entity261 football 's governing body			1
the aim is to use football to promote healthier living and also to fill the idle hours that refugee camps provide in abundance			0
more than 1,000 children and young adults under 20 are in the program , with 80 more being trained to coach			0
" all the children that arrive are completely devastated , " explains @entity271 , a 31 - year old @entity8 who had himself fled his home in @entity274 a few months before			0
once a keen amateur soccer player , he is now coaching @entity6 's new arrivals			1
" they have seen their family members killed before their eyes and the journey to @entity9 is a difficult one , " he says			2
" through football we at least try to remove the sense of fear and regain some sense of normalcy			0
" meanwhile as the war in @entity8 continues			0
@entity6 's numbers swell every day			1
" it is a really difficult job , " @entity10 says			2
as the coaching class for young @entity8 men finishes , the children are still on the sand pitch , shrieking as they chase the ball as a pack			0
" but , " @entity10 adds , " we have to bring them back to life			2

as many as *150.000* people living in @entity6
star for the @entity9 women 's national team @entity10 is coaching in the camp
@entity10 says coaching helps to build refugeesl ' confidence
