back in 2010 , @entity0 launched a short - lived social network service called " buzz			2
" instead of simply promoting @entity2 and urging users to sign up for it , or opt in , @entity0 chose instead to sign up @entity6 users as @entity2 users			1
if users were n't happy , they could always opt out			0
private e-mail addresses became publicly available as social network contacts			0
the @entity13 investigated , @entity0 backed off , and eventually the company settled with the @entity13 and agreed not to rope users into new services that they have n't signed up for			2
now @entity0 is back at it			0
this week the company announced that it was tying the inboxes of @entity6 users to @entity22 users			1
by using @entity6 addresses to autocomplete messages from @entity22 users , @entity0 is basically giving strangers who may not know your e-mail address a way to connect with you through @entity6			1
this move may bolster short - term value for @entity0 but reduces privacy for @entity6 users			1
this announcement is partly about the ongoing competition with @entity34 , but it is also about @entity0 's increasing integration of user data across various internet services			0
that happened when @entity0 decided to revise its privacy policy for @entity6 and other @entity0 products so that it could target more advertising and do more profiling of users			1
the consequences for users and for the @entity49 are troubling			1
from a privacy perspective , @entity0 's action makes it more likely that personal information of users will become more widely available			1
and as the @entity49 's most dominant company , @entity0 is exploiting its control over key internet services to beat back competition and expand its market reach			2
those who favor a free , open and democratic @entity49 should take note			0
@entity0 is also unfairly expecting @entity6 users to opt out of a service they never signed up for to maintain their current expectations of privacy			1
it 's fine if some users like the new feature			0
they should be free to opt in			0
but those who value privacy should not be expected to check their privacy settings every time a company alters its business model			0
with the latest change to @entity6 , @entity0 is testing the resolve of regulators to protect privacy			0
if government officials do not intervene , things could get much worse			1
at the moment , @entity0 is simply using @entity6 account addresses to auto - complete e-mail addresses for @entity22			1
but of course @entity0 is sitting on the biggest search database in the world and could also use that data it has collected from users to auto - complete e-mail addresses and much more			2
in 2010 , @entity0 was right to back off the plan for @entity2 and the @entity13 was right to pursue an investigation and help ensure that similar fiascos do not occur			0
but now that @entity0 is once again commingling data in e-mail accounts and social network accounts , the @entity13 will need to intervene			2
opting out is not the solution .			0

@entity22 users can now e-mail *people* without knowing their e-mail address
@entity102 : the consequences for users and for the @entity49 are troubling
he says @entity0 should let users opt in rather than opt out of new privacy setting
@entity102 : if government officials do not intervene , things could get much worse
