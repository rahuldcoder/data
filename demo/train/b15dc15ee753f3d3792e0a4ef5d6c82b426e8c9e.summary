there 's been a lot of buzz about the " zen " of the @entity5			1
some people are wondering whether their regular yoga and meditation sessions give them an edge over the competition			1
fact is , many teams and individual players across the @entity15 have been practicing yoga for years			1
i worked with my first pro football players , two tight ends from the @entity19 , back in 2006			1
@entity15 players , like weekend warriors , save their biggest events for the weekends ( with the exception of monday and thursday - night football , of course )			1
therefore , they need to be smart all week about preparing their bodies and minds for the big game			1
for my football clients , yoga is an essential part of that preparation			1
mobile midbacks and hips with stable cores and shoulder girdles are important for any athlete , but especially athletes that have to absorb impact			1
when mobility and stability are limited in any of these areas , the risk of knee , low - back and neck injuries increases dramatically			1
the same mentality applies to weekend warriors , who likely spend much of their week as desk jockeys then suddenly take part in strenuous activity			1
unless they integrate mobility exercises into their everyday lives , they risk wrenched backs , sprained knees and dislocated shoulders during even the friendliest of touch football games			1
to avoid injury and work towards super-bowl shape , weekend warriors can use some of the same techniques and moves i teach in pro football			1
here 's a sample : quick - and - easy breathing meditation : the mental game is no joke ! neither is a stiff ribcage that impedes movement			1
not only can your breath relax and focus your mind by tapping into your parasympathetic nervous system , the quality of your breathing dictates your ribcage position , which affects your core strength and upper - body range of motion			1
start and end your yoga practice with a minimum of two minutes of deep , diaphragmatic breathing with your eyes closed			1
inhale through your nose into the bottom and back of your lungs			2
exhale slowly and fully , releasing the ribcage downward by engaging core muscles to assist			2
pausing briefly after exhalation stimulates a naturally deeper inhalation			2
try breathing at this pace : 5 - count inhalation			2
practice 10 - to - 20 rounds of breath , focusing all of your attention on your breathing			2
most people do n't realize that meditation can be that quick and easy ! extended angle stabilizes and mobilizes hip joints , increase core strength and enhances midback rotation from a deep lunge with your left foot forward , place your left hand on the mat or a block just inside of your left foot			2
reach your right arm overhead , trying to match the angle of your side body and back right leg			2
engage your core for stability			2
be sure the rotation of your chest and ribcage is coming from your midback			0
hold the for three long , deep breaths			0
repeat on the other side			0
side plank variation with hip and leg lift @entity133 abductors ( outside of hip ) and glutes ; strengthens shoulder and obliques ( side core ) in side plank , with your feet stacked , be sure the shoulder of your supporting arm is behind your wrist			0
step your top foot down to the floor in front of your pelvis			0
press through your heel as you lift your hips and raise your top arm			0
hold for three long , deep breaths			0
switch to the other side			0
standing straddle with twist @entity133 abductors ( groins ) and hamstrings ; enhances midback mobility from a standing straddle with your toes pointed forward , hinge from your hips and fold down to place one hand on a block			0
twist from your midback to reach your opposite arm skyward , trying to align your wrists vertically			0
keep your lower back level and stable			0
engage your core and press through the outer edges of your feet for stability			0
hold for three long , deep breaths			0
repeat with the other arm			0
do the practice above several times a week for the best results			0
with just three moves and some breathing , you can easily start your day with it or even integrate it into the beginning or end of your workouts			0
think yoga is n't cool ? i know quite a few 280 - pound @entity15 players who would disagree			1
you probably do n't want to argue with them .			0

many teams and individual players across the @entity15 have been practicing yoga for years
yoga techniques they use to stay focused can work for everyone
