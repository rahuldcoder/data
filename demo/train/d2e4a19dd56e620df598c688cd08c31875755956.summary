-- dressed in a white cowboy hat and shirt in the merciless sun , 63 - year - old @entity1 proudly pulls a branch down in his lime grove and cups a fruit			1
his limes , he says , set themselves apart by their juiciness			1
he has been growing the fruit for the last 12 years and has never experienced a time of such upheaval			2
officially , lime prices are in a spiral of hyperinflation , the national average jumping at a monthly average of around 50 % this year			1
@entity19 says he is receiving an even wider margin for his produce in the state of @entity23			2
he pinpoints a variety of factors in @entity26 for the soaring prices			1
" there 's the devastation caused by a citrus disease , " he says			2
" then there is climate change			2
with the arrival of winter there has been a cold snap in nearby states			0
and what i feel is most devastating are the price speculators			0
" another factor is the continuing violence in the state of @entity43 , a top lime producer			0
vigilante groups there are battling drug cartels , with the federal government caught in the middle			0
many growers ca n't -- or wo n't -- put trucks on the road			0
those hardest hit are inevitably working class @entity26 , who rely on the staple for drinks , garnishes and ingredients for most dishes			1
" i normally buy two kilos , " one shopper at a market in @entity62 tells me			0
" but now i buy a half and only use them for absolute essentials			0
" @entity26 is the world 's largest lime producer and export markets have also felt the brunt of rising costs			1
some @entity74 airlines have announced they are restricting the service of limes on flights and @entity26 restaurants are absorbing greater costs			1
@entity74 - based @entity80 is a high - end chain with 19 locations around the world			0
they buy more than one million limes a year			1
" i can tell you this time last year we were paying approximately $ 36 a case , " says manager @entity86			2
" the first delivery this morning was $ 110 a case			0
we 've not passed that onto the guest and do n't plan to			0
" so while you may not be paying more for your margarita right now , profits are being squeezed			1
if lime prices stay the same , @entity80 estimates it will have to pay an additional $ 650,000 this year			1
for @entity26 producers like @entity1 who have not been hit by shortages , all this represents a big payday			1
he plans to use the profits to expand , upgrading his fertilizer and irrigation systems			2
the @entity26 government , too , is trying to boost supply			1
although the scale of the lime crisis is unique this year , the early months traditionally see a shortfall			2
" we have just generated a technology in @entity23 which will launch in september , " says @entity113 official @entity112			0
" we will trim the branches of lime trees and immediately apply nitrogen to induce flowering			0
and this flowering in the month of october will produce limes in february , march and april			1
" consumers and businesses will have to wait until 2015 to see how effective the program is			0
the hope is that the brand of a key @entity26 crop has not been tarnished			1
watch more : why it 's time to buy in the emerging markets			0

limes are in a spiral of hyperinflation , with prices *doubling* every month this year
those hardest hit are working class @entity26 , who rely on limes for their dishes
profits are being squeezed and the pain may soon be felt beyond @entity26
