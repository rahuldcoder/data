-- an announcement on tuesday marked , quite literally , a watershed moment in the history of solar system exploration			1
@entity6 scientists said an analysis of drilled rock samples collected by the @entity10 rover shows that ancient @entity11 could have supported living microbes			1
it is the first time that we 've discovered actual evidence for fresh water on another planet			1
we 've been down this watery path before -- sort of			0
back in 2004 , @entity6 's opportunity rover found evidence of ancient water on @entity11			1
for a place to be habitable by life as we know it , it has to have liquid water , heat sources like volcanoes or impact craters , and carbon - bearing organic molecules			0
@entity6 : yes , @entity11 could have hosted life @entity11 had abundant volcanoes and impacts early on , and opportunity rover scientists finally found smoking gun evidence for the ancient liquid water			1
what that rover could n't tell us was whether @entity11 had organic molecules			2
but organic molecules get delivered to planets all the time from impacts by small and large asteroids and comets ( like february 's fireball impact above @entity47 , @entity48 ) , providing the last key ingredient for habitability			0
that argument sealed the deal back in 2004 : @entity11 was habitable			2
cool ! but the evidence we found in the rocks back then prescribed a very specific kind of habitable environment , and one that many biologists think is quite rare and special			0
the rocks contained abundant sulfur minerals , implying that the water in which they formed contained sulfuric acid			0
on @entity65 there are micro-organisms that can live , and even thrive , in acidic water , even battery acid			0
but these are rare and specialized niche organisms , what biologists call " extremophiles , " because they love extreme environmental conditions			0
still , extreme conditions or not , it meant that @entity11 could have been habitable for some forms of life			2
now fast - forward to 2013 , where in the past few weeks the @entity79 has been drilling into some different rocks half a planet away , inside a deep basin formed by the @entity85 impact crater			0
armed with more sophisticated analysis tools than earlier rover teams , @entity10 scientists have been able to conclusively find the first on - the - ground evidence for the presence of abundant clay minerals within those drilled rocks			2
clays are water - loving materials ( just ask any friends who make pottery ) , sometimes forming from the interaction of water and different kinds of precursor volcanic rocks , and holding much of that water within their mineral structures			0
but here 's the catch : clay minerals are easily dissolved in acidic water			0
because they are preserved in the @entity85 crater still today , it implies that the water there had relatively little acidity -- that is , it was fresh water , like the water you 'd find in most ponds or lakes on @entity65 today			1
indeed , there 's geologic evidence from the rover and from @entity6 's @entity11 orbiters that there may once have been a large lake and streams within the basin that @entity10 is driving around in now			1
and there 's more to be excited about			0
micro-organisms on @entity65 are much more common in fresh water than acidic water , and so rather than @entity11 just having been a potential haven for some extreme forms of life , @entity10 's discovery means that @entity11 had -- and still preserves evidence of -- environments that were habitable for an enormous variety of micro-organisms that thrive on our own planet			1
it seems as though @entity6 or other space agencies " rediscover " water on @entity11 every few years , so maybe this latest announcement will be regarded as just more of the same			1
but this time it 's different -- really ! the stakes have just been raised a notch : not only is there another planet right next door in our own solar system that had habitable environments on its surface long ago , but there appear to have been common and recognizable -- perhaps even earthlike -- environments on @entity11			1
that 's the big news coming out of this latest discovery from @entity6 's @entity11 rovers			2
curiosity is only about a quarter of the way through its primary mission , so there 's lots of time to search for more watery evidence , as well as for any elusive associated organic molecules , which have yet to be found			2
because of abundant solar ultraviolet radiation at the surface , organic molecules might not be preserved as well as clay minerals			0
but @entity10 has the tools , and the brainpower back here on @entity65 , to find out			0
the implications of discovering evidence for fresh water are exciting for macro-organisms as well : rover chief scientist @entity179 of @entity6 's @entity180 has speculated that we would have been able to drink that ancient water , had we been there some 2 , 3 , or 4 billion years ago to witness glorious @entity184			1
let 's go back in time -- how would you like your water ? sparkling , fresh , or @entity11 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			1

@entity6 announced on tuesday that ancient @entity11 could have supported living microbes
@entity193 : this is quite literally a watershed moment in the history of solar system exploration
he says it is the first time that we 've discovered evidence for fresh water on another planet
@entity193 : curiosity rover is not done with its mission ; it may find even more *interesting* things
