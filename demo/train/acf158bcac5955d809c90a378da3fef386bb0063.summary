" it is a great tournament with amazing fans			0
i look forward to competing there in the future			0
" although no reason was given for his absence , @entity1 said after a surprise defeat to @entity15 in his native @entity16 last week that he had been having " serious problems " with the back and needed to take anti-inflammatory medication			1
the withdrawal continues a disappointing spell for the 17 - time grand slam champion , who turns 32 on aug. 8			1
@entity1 appeared to be headed in the right direction going into @entity25 when he won his first title of 2013 in @entity27 , @entity28 on grass			1

when the new rankings were released after @entity25 , he dipped to no. 5 , his lowest position in 10 years			0
@entity1 decided to enter tournaments in @entity39 , @entity28 and @entity40 , @entity16 with a larger racquet -- a significant change for a tennis player -- but lost to opponents outside the top 100 and top 50 , respectively			2
" a change like this is very important but i honestly ca n't tell right now due to my low level , " @entity1 said in @entity40 , when asked about the new racquet			2
" it 's hard to analyze anything			0
" i still do n't have even enough information to try and explain			0
i have no clue where i am right now with the racquet change			0

as one double - digit grand slam winner skipped @entity4 , another is set to return			1
@entity61 arrived in the @entity63 city having not played since a first - round loss to @entity65 at @entity25			2
@entity61 has been troubled by his knees this season , despite winning the @entity68 in june			0
he returned to the tour early this year following a seven - month layoff			0
" i will try to arrive competitive in @entity4 because seven weeks without playing is n't ideal for competing in such a difficult tournament , " @entity61 was quoted as saying by the @entity72 's website			1
" but i 'll do everything possible for things to go well			0
" @entity76 plays his first tournament , too , since ending @entity79 's 77 - year wait for a men 's singles winner at @entity25			0
