before 14 - year - old @entity2 allegedly killed his algebra teacher , the pair had at least one more encounter as student and teacher , a witness said			1
@entity2 had been doodling and listening to music during @entity10 's algebra i class during the school 's final period , classmate @entity7 told @entity13			1
creating such drawings was unusual for @entity2 , and when the final bell sounded at 1:55 p.m. tuesday , @entity10 asked him to stay after class			1
@entity7 sat two desks over from @entity2 , who rarely participated in class discussion but was " a really good student , " she said			1
while shuttling between two after - school meetings , @entity7 said , she looked into the same classroom and saw @entity10 standing by her computer and @entity2 sitting in a chair about 5 to 10 feet away			1
the teacher smiled at her , @entity7 recalled			2
at some point that afternoon , @entity10 went to a student girls ' bathroom on @entity32 's second floor , as someone was in the locked faculty bathroom , a source close to the investigation said			1
@entity2 allegedly followed her in			1
the school reopened its doors friday , as the first answers began to surface			2
how was @entity10 killed ? with a box cutter the suspect , @entity2 , had brought into school , a source close to the investigation says			1
what happened to her body afterward ? it was stashed in a recycling bin , rolled outside , then dumped about 20 feet into woods behind the northeastern @entity50 high school 's athletic fields , adds another source			1
it was left there -- not buried , not even covered			0
and where did the alleged killer go afterward ? after changing his clothes , he went to a @entity58 's fast - food restaurant and a movie , sources say , before police in a neighboring town saw him walking on a busy road under the pitch - dark sky early wednesday			0
yet the question of why this happened -- why a popular young educator who always wore a smile and went the extra mile was killed allegedly by a teenager who friends , family and co-workers described as reserved and well - behaved -- continues to loom large			2
caring , compassionate teacher was ' brilliant ray of light ' @entity2 , who had moved to the @entity79 suburb of @entity80 before the start of the school year , remains jailed without bond			1
a grand jury will play a big part in deciding his next step : if they indict him for first - or second - degree murder , he -- like any juvenile age 14 or older -- would be tried as an adult , based on @entity50 law			0
meanwhile , the tight - knit @entity93 community is still trying to make sense of what he allegedly did and of life without a teacher who so many appreciated , learned from and loved			2
" it 's just surreal how quickly someone can go , and how much we take for granted every day , " said @entity32 student @entity98			0
@entity10 was " the nicest teacher you could ever have			1
i ca n't believe it			0
" there will be a wake for @entity10 at @entity106 in @entity107 on sunday , and her funeral will take place there monday			1
a member of the @entity10 family , who declined to be named , said the family is " doing as well as can be expected			1
" two missing - persons reports come together students and colleagues described the 24 - year - old @entity10 as someone who gave everything for her students -- be it a pat on the back , a sensible explanation to a tricky concept , or the time , effort and heart to work through problems , math or otherwise , with them			1
one of those students was @entity2 , a freshman			1
sometime after @entity10 held him back after class , she was killed in the bathroom			1
there , @entity10 was punched a few times before being killed with a box cutter around 3:30 p.m. , said a source			1
her body went into a recycling bin , then outside the school where it was tossed			0
authorities eventually found a bin that apparently had been thrown off an embankment about 100 feet away from @entity10 's body , a source said			1
before police found her -- before they even knew she was missing -- they 'd started looking for @entity2			1
this was in the early evening , with @entity147 tweeting to residents that he had n't returned home and was last seen around the @entity151 movie theater in the town about 20 miles northeast of @entity79			0
@entity153 , the theater 's manager , told @entity13 that @entity2 arrived around 4:15 p.m. tuesday and caught the start of the @entity157 film , " @entity158 , " about 15 minutes later			1
surveillance video , which was turned over to police , confirmed that @entity2 was there until the movie let out around 6:15 p.m. , he said			1
" he fit right in like a normal , everyday person , " @entity153 said friday , noting that teen paid cash for his ticket and had on clean clothes			0
while they were looking for him , police got a call around 11:20 p.m. tuesday about another missing person : @entity10			2
she was n't home either , nor had she answered her phones			0
the stories started coming together about an hour later , when police officers in nearby @entity175 found @entity2 walking along @entity176			2
whatever he told detectives in his subsequent interviews , whatever they saw in surveillance footage from the school , led to @entity2 's arrest for murder			1
it also led them to @entity10 's body in the woods			2
read the complaint a quiet and normal student @entity2 is a quiet young man , those who know him said			1
he excelled at soccer and made a harmless impression			0
" he ... seemed quiet and reserved , but he just seemed normal , " said @entity192 , who was in @entity2 's @entity194 class			1
@entity2 did n't drink or do drugs , and he came from a good family , one of his closest friends said			2
he described @entity200 as a good athlete who was shy at first but eventually warmed up to people , adding that he had n't been acting strangely lately			0
friends got their first hint that something was awry when @entity2 did n't show up for soccer practice tuesday			2
the team set out to look for him after seeing texts that he was missing			0
he was a newcomer to @entity80 , a town of about 26,000 people			0
his family had bounced around , and he had lived in different cities in @entity214 and @entity215 since he was in fourth grade , authorities in those states said			0
friends , relatives bewildered by arrest of ' storybook kid ' in teacher slaying a teacher who went the extra mile meanwhile , many were at a loss in @entity80 to explain the death of @entity10 -- a woman who inspired many , whether it be in the classroom or online , with her heart , intellect and positive spirit			1
" she was talking on saturday about this year was a good year			0
she was teaching freshmen for the first time			0
she was happy , " said @entity235 , @entity10 's best friend			2
" i do n't even know what the world is like without her			0
it 's a scary thought			0
" sympathy spread through the region , making its way into the baseball @entity244			0
bleachers full of fans who had assembled to watch the @entity247 take on the @entity248 observed a moment of silence in @entity10 's honor before game 1 began wednesday night at @entity79 's @entity253			2
@entity10 , a 2011 graduate of @entity254 who was working toward a master 's degree at @entity256 , seemed to always wear a wide smile and was approachable to students and colleagues alike , said @entity260 , who became good friends with @entity10 in 2011 when they taught at the same middle school			1
" she was energetic , she was compassionate , " @entity260 said			0
" you could n't ask for anything more from a teacher or a friend			0
" @entity256 issued a statement lamenting @entity10 's death			2
" she believed children have much to offer and often do not realize how special they are as individuals , " the university said			0
" in her application to @entity256 she said she was dedicated to ' helping students in times of need			0
' " @entity10 was known to take to @entity276 to dole out homework assignments and wisdom to her students			2
" no matter what happens in life , be good to people , " she wrote in august			0
" being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind			0
" debate unfolds after teacher slayings in @entity286 , @entity50			0
