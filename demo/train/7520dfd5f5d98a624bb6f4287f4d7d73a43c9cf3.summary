@entity0 -- one of the world 's most powerful @entity3 preachers lives behind a gated compound in the small , leafy town of @entity7 , @entity8			2
the reclusive @entity11 cleric 's name is @entity12			1
if you believe the @entity11 government , supporters of this cleric in @entity8 are spearheading a coup attempt in @entity11 that is destabilizing one of @entity20 's most important allies in the @entity21			1
in recent weeks , @entity11 prime minister @entity22 , a religious conservative , has compared @entity12 and his supporters to a virus and a medieval cult of assassins			1
meanwhile , in an interview with @entity1 , a top official from @entity22 's ruling @entity30 , or @entity30 , called the @entity32 movement a " fifth column " that had infiltrated the @entity11 police force and judiciary			1
" we are confronted by a structure that does n't take orders from within the chain of command of the state , " parliament member and deputy @entity30 chairman @entity36 told @entity1			0
" rather , it takes orders from outside the state			0
" who is this mysterious man in @entity8 ? the 72 - year old imam went into self - imposed exile when he moved from @entity11 to the @entity20 in 1999			1
he rarely speaks to journalists and has turned down interview requests from @entity1 for more than two years			0
but in a rare e-mail interview published in @entity54 on tuesday , @entity12 denied any involvement in a political conspiracy			1
" we will never be a part of any plot against those who are governing our country , " he wrote , according to @entity54			0
@entity3 cleric and school spiritual leader supporters describe @entity12 as a moderate @entity3 cleric who champions interfaith dialogue			1
promotional videos show him meeting with pope @entity69 in the @entity70 in the 1990s			0
he also repeatedly met with rabbis and @entity73 priests in @entity11			1
the preacher is best known as the spiritual leader of a network of schools and universities that operate in more than 100 countries			0
in the @entity20 , this academic empire includes @entity81 , the largest charter school network in @entity82			0
the @entity20 @entity83 awarded @entity81 schools in @entity82 a $ 30 million grant after they received high scores in the government 's " @entity89 " education competition			1
every year , students from @entity32 schools around the world gather in @entity0 for a lavish series of concerts , dances and academic competitions called @entity97			0
at these events , @entity99 students perform @entity11 folk dances in traditional @entity11 costumes before packed stadium audiences			2
@entity12 supporter and newspaper columnist @entity104 insisted the schools " are not owned by @entity12 , " but by a loose network of volunteers from the cleric 's movement			1
" these people know each other , they meet together , but officially speaking , ( the schools ) are owned by different businessmen , " @entity104 explained			0
volunteers in the @entity32 movement also own tv stations , the largest - circulation newspaper in @entity11 , gold mines and at least one @entity11 bank			2
" there are many businessmen in @entity11 who espouse the ideas of @entity32			2
because starting from the 1960s , @entity12 has been teaching them look , in order to be a good muslim , you do n't have to be a poor guy , " explained @entity104 , who is also a professor of political science at @entity125 , a @entity12 - affiliated school in @entity0			1
relations with the prime minister throughout much of the last decade , the @entity32 movement was also a strong @entity22 supporter			1
pro-gulen media outlets backed sprawling investigations of alleged coup plots organized by @entity11 military commanders			1
dozens of military officers , as well as secular writers , academics and businessmen , waited for years in prison for trials that critics called witch hunts			0
at that time , it also became increasingly dangerous to criticize the @entity32 movement			0
police arrested and imprisoned writer @entity150 for more than a year , accusing him of supporting a terrorist organization			0
a court banned his book " the @entity157 's @entity156 , " which took a critical look at the @entity32 movement , before it was even published			2
now out of prison , but still facing charges , @entity150 said the long - standing alliance between @entity11 's two most prominent @entity3 conservative leaders -- @entity22 and @entity12 -- had collapsed into a bitter power struggle			1
" there was a forced marriage , and the fight that began with who would lead the family is continuing as an ugly divorce , " @entity150 told @entity1			0
" on the one side , there is the @entity32 community , a dark and opaque power that can damage the most powerful administration in @entity11 history			2
and on the other side , you have an administration that under the guise of fighting this community can and has suspended all legal and democratic principles , " he said			0
in november , @entity22 announced plans to shut down privately owned preparatory schools , which help some @entity11 students study for university entrance exams			2
pro-gulen media groups denounced the move , which would hurt an important part of the @entity32 academic empire in @entity11			2
anti-corruption raids on december 17 , police carried out a series of anti-corruption raids targeting dozens of people closely linked to the @entity11 government			1
among those arrested were the sons of two senior cabinet ministers as well as the head of the state - owned @entity199			0
outlets like the @entity202 newspaper @entity201 published detailed reports alleging that police found large amounts of cash -- in the case of the bank director , stored in shoe boxes -- in the homes of some of the suspects			0
@entity22 denounced the allegations of graft against his government			2
instead , he accused police and prosecutors of organizing a politically motivated investigation to hurt his party before nationwide municipal elections in march			0
the @entity11 government embarked on the highly unusual mass demotion of thousands of police and prosecutors believed to be involved in the investigation			1
' @entity223 is behind us ' " there is a political crisis in @entity11 right now , and also a societal crisis in the sense that i 've hardly seen @entity11 society this polarized , this tense , this paranoid , " said @entity225 , author of the book " @entity227			1
" " both sides use religious language to justify themselves , " @entity225 added			0
" both sides say ' @entity223 is behind us			0
' " in a fiery speech distributed on one of his movement 's websites last month , @entity12 accused the @entity11 government of hypocrisy			1
" those who do n't see the thief but go after those trying to catch the thief , who do n't see the murder but try to defame others by accusing innocent people : let @entity223 bring fire to their houses , ruin their homes , break their unity , " the cleric yelled while shaking his fist in anger			0
there are few signs that the power struggle between rival wings of the @entity11 bureaucracy shows any signs of letting up			2
speaking on condition of anonymity , @entity22 supporters have said that a recent series of police arrests targeting alleged @entity269 suspects in @entity11 were actually carried out by @entity202 police and prosecutors seeking to embarrass the @entity11 government			1
within hours of the anti-al @entity269 raids on january 14 , a counter-terror police commander involved was reportedly demoted to his department 's juvenile crimes division			0
as the mudslinging also continues between different factions of the @entity11 media , it is highly unlikely that the enigmatic cleric , safely sequestered in @entity8 , will return to face the political firestorm in @entity11 anytime soon .			1

@entity11 government says group managed by @entity12 is leading a coup attempt in @entity11
he denies any involvement in a political conspiracy
@entity12 's group once backed @entity11 's prime minister , but that relationship has soured
