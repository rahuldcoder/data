-- being coach of a nation 's football team brings enormous responsibility			1
the stakes are high , and the weight of expectation is even greater			0
some say , for instance , that the @entity12 manager 's job is second only in importance to the @entity16 prime minister 's role -- and @entity17 has already been subject to intense scrutiny before his first match in charge against @entity21 in this weekend 's @entity23 warmup match			1
but though undeniably demanding , @entity17 's job is arguably a walk in the park compared to the task facing @entity28			1
on another island group , half a world away -- and light years in terms of sporting and economic development -- the @entity30 coach is getting to grips with turning a tiny nation 's team into one recognized by football 's governing body @entity39			1
@entity17 may have the splendor of @entity42 for home games , but @entity45 's main pitch has more sand than grass			1
part of the @entity49 , @entity45 is made up of 33 coral islands about 2,500 miles southwest of @entity51 , with a population of just over 100,000			2
it is one of the world 's poorest countries and the @entity57 ranks it as having a gross domestic product only greater than that of @entity61			0
who are @entity65 football 's " @entity63 ? " @entity28 , recently appointed as the @entity67 's technical director and head coach , has worked closely with a number of professional clubs in the @entity16 as well as helping deliver coaching courses for @entity65 football 's governing body @entity72			1
he must also be the only coach who holds the prestigious @entity75 qualification through three different national associations -- @entity12 , @entity77 and the @entity78 -- after deciding to research different approaches to the courses			1
he is likely to need that raft of qualifications given that @entity45 suffered two 17 - 1 defeats at the @entity84			1
" one of my aims now is to make us more competitive at international level within the @entity92 , " @entity28 told @entity0 , laughing at the suggestion he has taken on the toughest coaching job in the world			1
" while achieving this will improve the status of the national team i also think this will be a very important for the development of game in the country as a whole , as it will offer the young players something positive to aspire to			0
" while @entity17 's time will be taken up by analyzing the teams @entity12 will face at @entity23 , handling the egos of millionaire players and enduring the barbed comments of a critical media , @entity28 's job description extends to helping the @entity67 find a sponsor and a kit supplier			1
oh , and given that it is a low - lying @entity92 island , global warming could possibly be a concern down the line			0
" generating this funding will determine how we can implement a range of programs at various levels to really move the game forward in the country , " said @entity28			2
his plan to rejuvenate @entity45 will evolve literally one game at a time			1
" this year we plan to participate in an international fixture against @entity127 , one of our ' local ' neighbors , in july and this will require us to raise considerable sponsorship to achieve this , " said @entity28			2
big - spending @entity135 top @entity134 value table there is also the small matter for @entity28 of helping the @entity45 @entity141 win @entity39 recognition , which would allow the islanders to play in international competitions and be eligible to receive funding from football 's global governing body			1
" our recent application was unsuccessful but this will be an ongoing process for us , " said @entity28			2
" however , while delivering this disappointing news @entity39 also promised some assistance in our efforts to develop the game			0
" this will be a great help to us and we will continue working towards meeting the membership criteria			0
it is the country 's ultimate ambition to compete in the @entity159 qualifiers			0
" of @entity45 's 33 islands , 21 are inhabited -- though most of its population is based in the @entity162			1
thirty - two are atolls ( ring - shaped islands with a central lagoon ) while @entity167 is a raised coral island			0
player selection is also a challenge , with just 2,351 registered male players over the age of 18 in @entity45 and only 468 women players			2
the islands extend 2,400 miles from east to west , so @entity28 also faces a travel headache as he scouts for talent			2
" the land mass of the country may be small but it is spread out over a huge area , so it offers a fairly unique logistical problem -- particularly if you need to implement a regular league season , " he said			0
" there is a huge passion for the game in the country and although there is n't much room for football pitches , there is still at least one on each of the islands			0
" this means that the pitches that are available are played on almost all of the time , which means the surfaces are n't the best			0
" surrounded by palm trees , @entity45 's @entity197 looks about as idyllic a location as you could want from a football ground , but with one small hitch -- it does not have much grass			1
indeed it has so little , the pitch could double up as a beach			0
" the installation of a 3g all - weather pitch would be of huge benefit to us on the main island as it would be used regularly and mean less wear on our stadium pitch , which would give us the chance to maintain it to international standard , and help us achieve our ambition of hosting a home international match , " added @entity28			1
" maybe this is one of the projects @entity39 can help us with			0
" @entity28 might not be a household name but he is quietly establishing a reputation as one of @entity16 's more innovative coaches			1
he believes that for too long @entity12 has been coaching players in " pretty much the same way , but expecting the end product to be different and thinking somehow talent will magically appear			2
" an advocate of overload training -- a method which encourages players to concentrate on doing several things at once -- he has devised one exercise in which players have to throw a tennis ball and call out colors while they are passing a football in sequence			0
" we are not providing players with the challenges that they need to meet the demands of the modern game , " said @entity28 , who has been working with @entity30 professional team @entity237 this season			1
" overload exercises help the player speed up the feet and the thought process			0
" @entity28 believes players ' decision - making is often not quick enough , a weakness that is caused by their inability to scan the pitch when they are without the ball			2
" do n't forget almost 98 % of the game is played off the ball			0
even in a basic passing drill i force the players to work on perception , scanning skills , technique , adjustability , concentration , attention focus and attention bandwidth			0
it 's quite amazing the effect it can have on players			0
" so does @entity28 have any advice for @entity17 ahead of @entity23 ? " in one word : win , " he said bluntly			1
" i think that has become almost only thing that matters for a coach at that level of the game			0
" @entity12 do n't just want to be in a position to participate in the @entity276 and @entity277 , they want to be competing and seriously challenging for the trophy			2
" however , i also think people like to see a steady stream of young talent coming through that also offers hope for the future			0
so , while the @entity12 manager 's focus is on the full team , i think he should be actively interested in the development squads at both international and club level			1
