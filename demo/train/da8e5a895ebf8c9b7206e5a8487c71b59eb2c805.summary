did police in @entity1 , @entity2 , deliberately fire tear gas and rubber bullets at a television news crew wednesday night ? photos and videos from the @entity9 camera crew were widely shared in the wake of wednesday 's incident , which @entity9 called an " egregious assault on @entity13 that was clearly intended to have a chilling effect on our ability to cover this important story			1
" the images showed a tear gas canister exploding close to the @entity9 correspondent @entity21 , who tried to shield himself from the smoke			1
was it intentional ? @entity21 's crew members seem to think so			2
" we were clearly set up as press with a full live shot set - up , " producer @entity25 said in an e-mail , responding to questions from @entity28			0
" as soon as ( the ) first bullet hit the car , we screamed out loud , ' we are press , ' ' this is the media			0
' " @entity25 said there 's no way to know who ordered police to shoot in their direction			2
" but they shined a huge floodlight at us before firing , and i can only imagine they could see what they were shooting at			0
" @entity44 , the videographer , said in another e-mail message that " we were fired at from a police @entity47 vehicle			1
" @entity47 is shorthand for a @entity47 vehicle , something usually associated with war zones			2
the crew left their equipment where it was , and moved on foot to what they thought was a safer location			1
" we sought shelter between houses , " @entity44 said , and then they called 911 and @entity9 's @entity62 assignment desk			1
a little bit later , another @entity47 vehicle approached the area where the crew was seeking shelter			2
" we ( a group of three ) yelled out to the @entity47 ( that ) we were press and we approached vehicle with hands visible , " @entity44 said			2
" they opened the back of the vehicle and ordered us inside			0
whilst the doors were open and we were outside -- i do recall seeing ' swat type ' firearms pointed at us			0
we were helped aboard , and taken back to our vehicle			0
" on the way back , @entity44 added , they passed what he believes was the @entity47 vehicle that shot at them on their way out of the area			0
heightening the confusion , the crew members did not know which police force fired the tear gas and rubber bullets , nor which police force picked them up and drove them back to their vehicle			1
on thursday morning , a representative of the @entity94 told @entity95 that its swat team did not fire the tear gas , but did pick up the crew later			1
@entity1 mayor @entity98 told @entity28 thursday that the @entity100 police have been " in charge tactically since sunday			0
" another camera crew nearby , from the local television station and @entity28 affiliate @entity104 , recorded what happened to the @entity9 crew			1
by thursday morning , its pictures were being broadcast on @entity28 and other networks			0
the @entity104 video showed police officers placing @entity9 's lights and other equipment on the ground			1
but something happened in between the tear - gassing and the police interference with the equipment , @entity44 said : local residents came over to the camera position and " played with the camera on the tripod			1
" nothing was damaged , but @entity44 's account suggests that the police action might have been intended to deter residents from damaging the expensive equipment			2
@entity9 , an offshoot of the @entity129 - based international news network that recently marked its one - year anniversary , said in a statement that " thankfully all three crew members are physically fine			1
" " we believe that this situation must be investigated along with those involving our colleagues at other media outlets , " the network added			0
two reporters were arrested at a @entity140 's restaurant near the site of a protest on wednesday			0
