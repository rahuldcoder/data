@entity0 , @entity1 -- what does @entity3 know ? we 're not the only ones who want answers to that question			1
according to a number of federal officials , investigators have plenty of questions for the widow of slain @entity17 bombing suspect @entity16 : what might she have known , if anything , about his activities in the days and months preceding the april 15 bombings ? about his travel and associations ? and then there 's that phone call law enforcement sources say @entity28 placed to her husband after authorities released pictures identifying him as a suspect in the bombings			1
what was up with that ? if it sounds like there are more questions than answers , you 're right			1
investigators have n't said what , if anything they know about what @entity28 knew before and after the bombings , which left three people dead and more than 260 wounded			1
four people have been charged in connection with the bombing , including @entity28 's brother - in - law , @entity50 , who is suspected of carrying out the attack along with his brother , @entity52 , 26			1
the older brother died april 19 after a firefight with police , hours after authorities released images of the suspected bombers			1
three of @entity50 's friends were charged wednesday , accused of helping cover his tracks after the bombing			1
authorities allege two of the men disposed of potentially incriminating items from @entity50 's dorm room and a bag containing fireworks ; the other allegedly made false statements to police			2
a laptop belonging to @entity74 is now in @entity76 custody , two federal law enforcement officials told @entity2			1
a lawyer for one of the suspect 's accused friends said his client turned it over			1
who is @entity3 ? friends describe @entity28 , a 2007 graduate of @entity86 , as " artistic , " " normal " and " well - liked , " a fan of the rock singer @entity87			0
she had one dustup with the law -- a june 2007 arrest for stealing $ 67 in goods from @entity92			0
she acknowledged the theft and gave back the merchandise , according to court records			0
later that year , she moved to @entity96 and enrolled at @entity97			0
then she met @entity16 at a nightclub			0
@entity28 dropped out of school her freshman year , converting to @entity101 before the couple married in a @entity104 mosque in june 2010			0
a daughter , now 3 , came soon after			0
she reportedly worked long hours as a home health aide while her husband stayed home to care for the child			1
did she know ? according to her attorney , @entity111 , the 24 - year - old widow knew nothing of plans to bomb the race , and reports of her husband 's involvement came as an " absolute shock " to @entity28 and her family			1
but tantalizing clues that have leaked into public have helped keep the spotlight on @entity28 , a @entity1 native			1
for one , law enforcement sources told @entity2 last week that a woman 's dna had been found on a fragment of a pressure cooker used in the attack			2
now , that dna could have come from anyone -- from a clerk at the store where the @entity16 brothers allegedly bought the pressure cookers to a victim of the bombings			0
and even if @entity124 samples last week show the genetic material was @entity28 's , one of the sources cautioned , it would n't prove @entity28 had done anything criminal at all			2
after all , lots of people handle pressure cookers every day in kitchens across @entity144			1
more recently , two sources familiar with the investigation told @entity2 that @entity28 had spoken with @entity52 after his picture appeared on national television april 18			0
what exactly the two said remains under investigation , the sources said			0
investigators may be able to recover the conversation , said @entity155 , a former counterterrorism agent for the @entity76			1
" we certainly have ways in national security investigations to find out exactly what was said in that conversation , " he told @entity2 's @entity156 on monday , adding that " all of that stuff is being captured as we speak whether we know it or like it or not			2
" " it 's not necessarily something that the @entity76 is going to want to present in court , but it may help lead the investigation and / or lead to questioning of her , " he said			1
legal questions more questions arise when it comes to what legal obligation @entity28 might have had to inform authorities of her husband 's identity once the photos went public			1
@entity28 did n't have any legal requirement to call authorities on learning her husband was potentially involved , criminal defense attorney @entity181 told @entity156			2
spouses ca n't be compelled to testify against each other in criminal cases			0
" maybe from a moral standpoint she would have wanted to do that , " he said			0
@entity2 legal analyst @entity192 said he did n't believe @entity28 would be able to enjoy " spousal privilege " against investigators ' questions			1
" the wife of a criminal defendant generally gets a spousal privilege " if there is a discussion that happened within the context of the marriage , @entity192 said			0
that 's what spousal privilege is about			2
but when the husband dies , and where he has revealed what he has told his wife to a criminal co-conspirator , the communication is no longer confidential and the wife can not claim spousal privilege protection			2
" the privilege is " really only meant to protect confidential communications to protect the institution of marriage , " he said			0
@entity28 can still assert the @entity219 to protect herself , unless she gets immunity from prosecutors , he said			0
defense attorneys often seek immunity for their clients in exchange for providing authorities with information			0
" her lawyer is probably sitting down with her , very worried about the fact that she may face charges herself , depending on the knowledge of the plot , " @entity192 said			2
" she has to have good information to get a deal from the feds , and that 's what we do n't know about at this point -- what kind of information to trade			2
" @entity28 's day - to - day life in the meantime , @entity28 remains largely out of view inside her parents ' @entity0 home , a fleet of unmarked law enforcement vehicles outside whenever she is there			1
the federal presence has caused such a disruption the local police have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood out of concern for the @entity28 family			0
she emerges about once a day , often wearing a leopard - print hijab , to travel to her attorney 's office in @entity265 , where she meets with lawyers and federal investigators			1
the nature of those meetings remains unclear			0
while she has not spoken with the public , her attorneys have said @entity28 is distraught over the loss of life and injuries suffered by bombing victims			0
" she cries a lot , " @entity111 said last week			0
@entity278 and @entity279 reported from @entity280 ; @entity281 wrote from @entity282 ; @entity2 's @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288 contributed to this report .			2
