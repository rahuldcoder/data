it 's starting to feel a little bit like @entity2 when it comes to parents under attack for letting their children do things on their own			2
the latest case ? a @entity10 , @entity11 , couple is facing a neglect investigation for letting their 10 - year - old son and 6 - 1/2 - year - old daughter walk home from a playground , about a mile from their house , by themselves on a saturday afternoon in late december			1
the story immediately brought to mind the @entity23 mom arrested for letting her 9 - year - old daughter play at the park alone while she worked at a @entity26 's and a @entity28 mom arrested after letting her 7 - year - old walk to the park alone			1
is it just me or have things suddenly gotten way out of hand when parents are being arrested -- or investigated -- for doing what was considered totally normal and appropriate just a few decades ago ? i asked @entity38 , the mother at the center of this latest national story , about her parenting philosophy			1
" the funny thing is , it 's so funny to call it a philosophy , " @entity38 said			0
brutally honest : when is it ok to leave your teen home alone overnight ? " in terms of crime , i lived in a more dangerous time period and my parents lived in a more dangerous time period ... so it just never occurred to me that this has to be a philosophy			1
" growing up in @entity57 , @entity58 , in @entity59 , she would go to the bowling alley or library at a young age by herself			0
" the idea that a parent would escort you somewhere , i mean my mother would have cracked up , ' what are you , nuts ? ' " as @entity38 's kids got older , she and her husband grew more aware of the whole concept of helicopter parenting -- and the idea that kids had to be supervised all the time			1
she started looking up information and found the book " @entity76 " by @entity77 and began following her online blog , too			0
" so from that , i would say , ' yeah , i 'm a free - range parent , ' " she said			1
" again , to me , the idea is , what happened to just parenting ? " @entity77 , a @entity59 mom , television host , speaker and author , was called the worst mother on the planet and meaner things than we could include in this article after she wrote a story in 2008 on why she let her 9 - year - old son take the subway by himself			1
after the uproar about her parenting , she wrote the book and started a blog , and now hosts a show called " @entity98 ? " airing at 9 p.m. et thursdays on the @entity99			2
@entity100 arrested for leaving 9 - year - old alone at the park @entity77 actually broke the story on @entity103 about the @entity104 being under investigation by @entity107 's @entity106 after they let their children walk home from a playground by themselves			1
" we 've been encouraged in our society to do what i call worst - first thinking , which is come up with the worst - case scenario first and proceed as if it 's likely to happen , and that 's what happened with the @entity104 , " @entity77 said			1
" someone sees two children alone , and they leap to ' oh , my @entity121 , they 're neglected			0
what if they 're run over by a @entity124 truck ? what if they 're kidnapped ? there are predators all around			0
' " crime rates are way down from when many of us were kids in the ' 70s ; rape , murder , burglary and arson are all down , said @entity77 , so it 's not exactly true to think today 's world is scarier than when i walked four blocks to the candy store when i was in the first grade			2
" and if we are going to say , ' oh , my @entity121 , i would never let my kid walk outside ; something bad could happen , ' well , i hope you 're saying that ' oh , my @entity121 , i would never put my kid in the car , something bad could happen , ' because the no. 1 way children die in @entity151 is as car passengers , and yet we seem to keep that ' danger ' in perspective , but we ca n't keep the same perspective when it comes to letting our children walk outside , " she added			2
the afternoon that thrust the @entity104 into the national spotlight was as normal as you can get			0
@entity161 and the kids were heading home after synagogue ( @entity38 was in @entity59 for a family event ) when they passed the playground the kids had been begging to go to for weeks			1
this playground was going to be " the next evolution of their ranging , " @entity38 said			2
she and her husband felt they were ready , and so he dropped them off at the playground and told them to return home in a little while			1
@entity28 mom arrested after letting 7 - year - old walk to the park alone about halfway on their walk home , the children were stopped by two police vehicles , @entity38 said			1
when officers asked whether they were lost or in trouble , the kids told them they were fine , that their parents knew where they were and that they are allowed to walk home by themselves , she said			1
the police drove the kids home to the @entity104 ' house			1
@entity191 , who 's 10 , called his mother crying , " @entity100 , the police are here			2
i 'm afraid they 're going to arrest @entity195 , " she remembered him saying			0
@entity161 was not arrested , but a few hours later , someone from @entity106 arrived and said the family needed to agree not to let the children be unsupervised until the matter was resolved within the agency , or the children would be taken into the custody of @entity106			2
after a number of calls with @entity106 , and after @entity106 allegedly interviewed the @entity104 ' children without their knowledge and without a parent being present , they are still waiting to have an in - office meeting with the agency			2
brutally honest : is it ok to let your children fail ? " this is no joke , " said @entity38			0
" the threat that they can take my kids is real			2
" the @entity218 said it is bound by state confidentiality laws preventing it from commenting on a specific case			2
" like all @entity224 in @entity11 , @entity223 is required to respond to all calls from community members and law enforcement about possible neglect , " the statement said			1
most states do n't have laws on the books regarding how old a child must be to be left alone			0
@entity11 is one of the few that does , stating that children under 8 years old may not be left unattended in a house or car			1
there is n't anything stipulated within the law about kids being alone outside			2
this is not the first time the @entity104 have been approached by @entity106			0
in october , a few days after @entity38 let the kids play at a playground around the block from their house and walk home by themselves , two @entity106 workers came to her door after they were contacted by someone mostly likely from the neighborhood , @entity38 said			1
that case was eventually closed			0
" we have no problem with people looking out for our kids			0
that 's actually what people always did , look out for each other , " @entity38 said			0
" it 's the idea that looking out for them then becomes reporting them to the police and making it criminal ... that it becomes somehow this is neglect			0
my kids were playing at the park			0
" the story has gotten a ton of traction online , with many parents expressing outrage about another case of a parent under investigation for letting children do things on their own			1
" the parents in the above referenced story have the right to raise their kids as they wish			1
i do not think it is a @entity106 issue , " wrote @entity283 , a lawyer and mom of two girls in @entity286 , @entity59 , in an email			0
" i personally give them credit for allowing their kids to have freedom at such a young age			0
" ' brutally honest ' : is it ok to spy on your kids ? @entity297 , a mom of two , said that whether she decides to let her children walk to the park alone is " simply her business , " not her neighbors '			1
" and if there is a bona fide question of neglect in my household , then @entity106 should be notified			0
anything less than that is government overreach , " said @entity307 , a writer , strategist and former senior counsel to the @entity310			0
@entity314 , a mom of two grown daughters , said she does n't believe the parents were negligent in this case , because the children were " obviously capable " of simply walking to and from the park			1
" my thought is if those of us who care for others would simply ' keep an eye on ' children as we drive to and fro , they would be safe nonetheless , " @entity314 said			0
" if you see a child walking and he or she is being approached by what seems to be a stranger , pull to the side of the road and ask if he or she is ok			0
" but some parents are asking questions about how young is too young to leave kids alone and how much one 's community should play in that decision			1
@entity343 , a father of three in @entity344 , said , " in a small town where the parent feels their children are safe , i 'd understand a parent allowing some freedom , at least more so than someone living in a larger city			0
" the world is a dangerous place , though , and we all need to protect ourselves and our children , especially our children , " said @entity343			0
the @entity104 hope their story helps get the message out that parents today may too often overestimate the danger and underestimate their kids			2
" our children need the freedom to grow into the happy , healthy , confident adults we want them to be , so we should trust our kids more , " @entity38 said			0
do you think it 's ok to let children walk home alone at a certain age ? share your thoughts with @entity372 on @entity373 or @entity374 on @entity375 .			1

@entity11 family allows their kids , 10 and 6 , to walk home alone from a playground
the family subscribes to the " free - range " parenting model
the case is just the latest in a *series* of parents questioned about leaving kids alone
