-- it is the role that every fan of the beautiful game counts on but which few people envy			2
the much - maligned position of the football referee is a job that attracts criticism , controversy and castigation on an almost weekly basis with little glory in return			2
@entity16 coach @entity15 is the latest to add his voice to the deafening boom of dissent so often aimed at various men in black around the world			0
despite a 5 - 1 victory for his side against @entity26 in @entity28 's @entity27 , the @entity23 boss let rip at the referee @entity29 's record of showing more then six yellow cards per match			1
@entity29 added to this with a red card for @entity15 himself , after the 47 - year - old told the official to " go f * * * himself " during the game , according to the ref. the incident follows similar controversy in @entity44 where @entity47 's game against @entity49 title rivals @entity45 last month ended in farce when @entity51 allowed @entity53 winger @entity52 to score despite his clear handball in the build - up			1
should referees be relegated too ? @entity51 's clanger came hot on the heals of referee @entity60 's blooper in @entity61 where he awarded a penalty to @entity63 against rivals @entity64 , before overturning his own decision before the kick was taken			2
in honor of all of the above , @entity67 takes a look at the best moments of on - pitch gaffes from soccer 's finest : @entity75 ball boy scores equalizing goal @entity77 was the first woman to ever referee a match in the @entity79 , and went on to handle games at the @entity81			1
but her career went into decline two years later when she inexplicably awarded santacruzense a late equalizer against @entity85 in a @entity87 clash			0
one of the home team 's players had fired a shot into the outside of the net , and the waiting ball boy took the chance to cheekily evade the visiting goalkeeper and tap a shot over the goal - line			1
@entity98 did not see the incident , but noticed the ball was in the net , so consulted with her linesman and awarded a goal -- sparking scenes of mayhem as the @entity85 players protested			1
despite the video evidence , the result of the match was allowed to stand			0
" i should have trusted my own vision , " @entity98 later admitted			0
three yellow cards equals one red top @entity49 referee @entity114 sabotaged his hopes of controlling a @entity117 final in 2006 when he made a massive blunder in @entity120 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity121 in a group - stage game in @entity123			1
@entity124 booked @entity125 after an hour and then in the final minute of regulation time -- but forgot to send the @entity127 from the pitch			0
he had the chance to compound his error in time added on when he handed @entity125 a third yellow card			2
it was third time unlucky for @entity124 , who had correctly dismissed @entity121 's @entity136 and @entity120 's @entity137 after giving the duo their second respective bookings just minutes earlier			2
@entity114 , who later admitted putting @entity125 's first yellow card against @entity120 defender @entity142 's name in his notebook , was widely mocked as the video spread around the @entity145 , and the 42 - year - old 's house was blockaded by media			1
" it opened my eyes as to who my real friends are and how much my family meant to me , " he said			0
fabiano one - ups @entity155 with double handball @entity158 referee @entity157 was left with egg on his face after allowing @entity161 to clearly handle the ball twice before scoring his second goal in the 3 - 1 win over the @entity165 at the @entity166			1
@entity157 was pictured laughing with the @entity168 striker when he questioned him about how he had controlled the ball			1
" i was n't sure if it was the elbow , the upper arm or the chest			0
so i decided to have a talk with him , he said it was chest			0
thereafter , i could do nothing but allow the goal			0
it was after the match i realized that @entity161 had been dishonest , " @entity157 told @entity182 newspaper			2
@entity157 had a nightmare match , later sending off @entity185 for a second yellow card after @entity165 's @entity187 went down in a heap following an innocuous collision with the @entity168 playmaker			1
@entity157 was duped again in a @entity192 match this month , when he waved play on and failed to book @entity194 's @entity193 after the goalkeeper whistled to distract an opposing player			2
@entity193 was subsequently handed a two - match ban for improper conduct for deceiving @entity199 forward @entity200 , who thought @entity157 had blown for offside when he broke clear of the defense			0
the case of the ' ghost penalty ' @entity205 was little known outside his native @entity206 until december 2008 , when the striker pulled off one of the most outrageous referee cons in the history of sport			0
the @entity212 player , nicknamed " @entity213 , " flung himself to the ground despite not being within meters of any opposing @entity216 players			0
the match official surprised everyone possessing a modicum of visual capacity when he awarded a spotkick despite having a clear view of @entity205 's swan - dive , and the home team converted the penalty and went on to win 2 - 0			1
however , @entity205 did not escape completely unpunished as he was sent off for another incident later in the match			0
a quick half @entity123 referee @entity229 secured his place in tales of notoriety with some decidedly erratic behavior in a 1975 @entity235 match between @entity236 and @entity237			0
he mistakenly blew for halftime only 29 minutes into what should be a three - quarter - hour period before a linesman pointed out his error , reported @entity123 journalist @entity242			0
having finally completed the half , @entity229 stuck his tongue out at a photographer , leading @entity236 's president @entity246 to quip : " for this show we could have charged a higher entrance fee			2
" @entity242 said that @entity229 initially denied drinking alcohol , but later admitted to consuming schnapps			0
" we are men -- we do n't drink @entity253 , " the official reportedly said			0
a thorny problem @entity61 referee @entity255 managed to be picked for the 1994 @entity117 panel despite an embarrassing mistake in a domestic match the year before			2
@entity255 failed to award a goal when a shot by @entity64 's @entity261 rebounded out of the net off a supporting stanchion and into the arms of a @entity266 player , who handed the ball to his goalkeeper			1
@entity255 somehow missed all that had transpired , not even noticing the illegal handball , and waved play on			0
after the @entity117 in the @entity272 , where he ordered an amazing 13 minutes of injury - time in @entity274 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity275 , he left the unpaid ranks and took up a professional contract refereeing in @entity279 's @entity278			1
@entity64 won their match against @entity266 4 - 0 , but @entity49 second division side @entity281 were denied a victory in 2008 when opponents @entity284 were awarded a goal for a shot which did not go between the posts			1
linesman @entity289 convinced 25 - year - old referee @entity290 that the ball had in fact crossed the line , prompting a now retired poll to comment in his column with @entity44 newspaper the @entity297 : " this is the most bizarre situation i 've ever seen in 40 years watching football and 27 years refereeing			1
" the goal that never was perhaps it is fitting that the last word should go to @entity301 , who is unlikely to be on @entity45 's christmas card list			1
he has the reputation of being one of @entity308 's best referees , despite the @entity52 incident and this major error in another match at @entity47 's @entity313 ground			1
@entity51 became the youngest @entity49 to reach @entity315 's international list at the age of 30 in 2006 , but the year before he was vilified by @entity45 fans after failing to spot that @entity319 ' speculative long - range effort had bounced off @entity47 goalkeeper @entity320 's chest and over the goal - line			1
the hapless @entity323 scrambled back into his own net and shoveled the ball back into the field of play , and the match ended in a goalless draw			2
@entity51 was suspended from refereeing for eight months from august 2008 following an investigation into his business activities , having been charged with a breach of contract by his ruling body , @entity334 .			0
