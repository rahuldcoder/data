-- seeing more mustaches this month ? many of them may be fighting cancer			1
on november 1 , global health charity @entity5 kicked off its signature event , a monthlong campaign encouraging participants to grow mustaches ( or " mo " s ) to raise cancer - fighting awareness and funds			1
why i 'm growing the ' stache according to @entity16 , @entity5 's ceo and co-founder , there are already more than 700,000 registered participants this year , and he expects to break 1 million -- a record for the organization			1
that 's quite the growth for a project that started with 30 guys in @entity24 in 2003			2
it was a social experiment back then , @entity16 said , with a simple goal : " it was really just for fun			0
we wanted to bring back the mustache			0
" but people quickly caught on , and it began generating a " surprising amount " of conversation , @entity16 said			0
the following year , four of the original 30 got together and decided to do it all over again -- for a cause			2
with a little research , they discovered that prostate cancer was a major health concern for men and decided it could benefit from an open , ongoing conversation			1
unlike breast cancer , which has been supported by major educational and fund - raising campaigns for years , prostate cancer had n't been spotlighted in a substantial way			2
" growing a mustache is a very manly pursuit , " @entity16 said , so the group chose prostate cancer as its primary cause , with men using their mustaches , and faces , as billboards			1
that year , 450 guys participated , raising $ 43,000			1
last year , 855,203 people participated around the world , raising $ 126.3 million			1
the funds go directly to @entity5 and its partners , the @entity59 and the @entity60			2
the organization 's strategy is simple : keep people talking -- about mustaches , and the larger issue of men 's health			1
research last year showed that participants have , on average , 2,400 @entity5 - related conversations a month , @entity16 said			1
about 30 are face to face			0
social media causes that message to amplify , he said			0
users have taken to @entity75 pages and @entity76 accounts to document their individual , ongoing facial hair activism			0
it is n't just one person asking another , " why the mustache ? " the answer spreads to 100 -- or 1,000			0
" the conversations do lead to a greater understanding , " @entity16 said			0
@entity5 encourages both men and women ( nicknamed " @entity89 " ) to participate throughout the month by registering through @entity88			1
the website has evolved an elaborate internal slang , including terms such as " @entity93 " and " @entity94 © , " which is what participants call their end - of - the - month celebrations , and it has information on everything from grooming tips to health risks			2
the rules are simple : do n't start with any facial hair and end with a lot			0
@entity16 's been asked before : why a mustache , not a goatee or beard ? " it is a mustache , ' " he said			0
" and it 's a mustache for a reason			0

@entity5 encourages men to grow mustaches to raise cancer awareness
the health charity includes almost 1 million participants globally
last year , @entity5 raised $ 126.3 million to fight cancer
