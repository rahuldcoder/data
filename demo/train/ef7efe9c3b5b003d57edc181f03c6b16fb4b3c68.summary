-- @entity1 sure knows how to stir controversy			1
the rock star turned provocateur has never shied away from controversy , from singing about having sex with underage girls in " @entity7 " to calling people names			0
in case you missed it , @entity1 's most recent rant raised all kinds of red flags when he called president @entity14 " a subhuman mongrel			1
" but even as the self - proclaimed " @entity1 " was called mad by critics , @entity1 did n't appear to lose any support among fans or politicians			1
some say @entity1 amplifies @entity22 ' anger at @entity23			2
but is he @entity24 ? the torchbearer for the disaffected ? " there are reasons ... people listen to him , " @entity27 sen. @entity27 , a tea party favorite , said			1
' dead or jailed ' it is n't like @entity1 is ever short of anything critical to say about anyone with whom he disagrees			2
he has called @entity37 a " worthless b * * * * " and @entity14 a gangster			0
@entity1 's extreme speech has made a lot of eyes roll			2
and media outlets , including @entity0 , have been criticized for giving him a microphone			0
two years ago , his comments at an @entity47 convention that he would be " dead or jailed " if @entity14 were re-elected earned him a visit from the @entity49			0
but this time , critics said @entity1 's statements went an insult too far			2
for the record , here 's what he said in an interview with @entity57 : " i have obviously failed to galvanize and prod , if not shame , enough @entity22 to be ever - vigilant not to let a @entity61 communist - raised , communist - educated , communist - nurtured subhuman mongrel like the @entity63 community organizer gangster @entity62 to weasel his way into the top office of authority in the @entity22			0
almost immediately , critics condemned his comments , calling for @entity1 to apologize and for public figures to distance themselves from him			2
@entity72 @entity27 gubernatorial candidate @entity71 came under fire for campaigning with @entity1			1
@entity71 's likely @entity75 opponent , @entity76 , called @entity1 's remarks -- and @entity71 's appearance with him -- an " insult " to @entity80			1
@entity71 told @entity0 on thursday there were no plans to campaign again with @entity1 , but he did not rule it out completely			1
and @entity27 , who told @entity0 he did n't agree with the rocker 's comments , left the door open for a possible future @entity1 cameo for him			1
@entity1 insists ' subhuman mongrel ' comments not racist ' @entity88 ' @entity27 strategist and former @entity91 adviser @entity89 said politicians " assume this star power will help them identify with voters and help them get some headlines they might not get if it was just another boring political rally or public event			1
" that star power is built in large part on @entity1 's music career , which peaked in the late 1970s when his signature single " @entity105 " cracked the @entity104 and he was selling out arena - sized venues			2
the self - proclaimed " @entity1 " released his greatest hits album in 1981 but that was followed by dwindling record sales			2
he served as a county sheriff in his native @entity112 and became an advocate for gun rights , hunters and conservation			0
on an appearance on " @entity119 " in the 1980s , the rocker spouted statistics about gun ownership and crime and the motivations of an " anti-gun cause			0
" " during the fall ... i do n't rock and roll , i like to harvest my own food , " @entity1 added			2
he emerged on the national political scene with the rise of the tea party in 2010			1
his politically incorrect comments on the music scene , once telling @entity131 he had affairs with underaged girls , transferred to the political stage , where he became an outspoken opponent of @entity14 and the @entity75			0
the risks include the increased chance for negative headlines that could turn off a more mainstream audience			0
on the other hand , an appearance with @entity1 might increase the candidate 's appeal to the rocker 's active supporters			1
take for example the rocker 's appearance with @entity71 at campaign events			1
the @entity150 reported that attendance at @entity71 's event in @entity153 in northern @entity72 near the @entity155 border " increased significantly " with @entity1 's appearance			1
at home with the ' @entity1 , ' @entity1 conservative appeal @entity159 , senior fellow at the liberal @entity160 , said that while @entity1 is not in the political mainstream , he appeals to a segment of the population that some politicians feel they ca n't ignore			1
@entity1 has a base among conservatives , and its size is not trivial , @entity159 said			2
still , @entity1 's comments about @entity14 this time around drew criticism from within that base of support			2
conservatives wrote opinion pieces , including one on @entity0 by conservative commentator @entity174 , who said he is " sick and tired of being embarrassed " by @entity1			2
@entity27 sen. @entity27 called on @entity1 to apologize , which he did , sort of			1
in an interview on @entity0 's " @entity177 , " @entity1 said he would " stop calling people names			1
" " instead of using terms like ' subhuman mongrel , ' i 'm going to get right to the meat of the matter where our president is a liar			0
he lies about you can keep your doctor period			0
over and over again he lies about @entity188			0
he 's lying about the @entity189 , " @entity1 said			2
when @entity1 took to @entity191 to tell his 1.8 million followers that he would continue " to fight the enemies of @entity22 infesting our government , " the post received 50,000 " likes			1
" in response to the latest controversy , @entity1 wrote on his @entity191 page : " i seek no attention			0
" he says he wants to " spotlight power abusers & gvt [ sic ] criminals ... to fight the enemies of @entity22 infesting our government			0
" that comment drew nearly 50,000 " likes " and included comments of support such as the one from @entity209 , who wrote " stand up and fight brother ... ted [ sic ] for president ! ! ! " @entity1 's appearance with @entity71 prompted cheers from fellow firebrand @entity215			1
on her @entity191 page , she decided to endorse @entity71 , writing , " if he is good enough for @entity1 , he is good enough for me ! " that comment received more than 20,000 " likes			1
" @entity1 sits on the board of the @entity47 and his vehement opposition to most restrictions on firearms attracts the support of many @entity226 defenders			0
he also has support from some tea party advocates			1
@entity229 , executive director of @entity230 , said he is pleased that @entity1 apologized for the " mongrel " remark and realized that inflammatory comments distract from his core message			0
he noted , however , that @entity1 has support because he talks about the issues his tea party group cares about , including reducing the size of government and " restoring @entity22 " after being " hurt by this administration and past administrations			1
" but it 's more than the themes that attract people to @entity1 , @entity229 says , it 's how he says it			1
politicians are politically correct and calculated , framing issues " in a way that is least offensive , " @entity229 says			0
but @entity1 " speaks a different language , " one to which many @entity22 can relate			1
he " speaks from his heart , " @entity229 said			0
but when asked about the offensive things @entity1 has said , @entity229 defended him , saying he does n't think @entity1 is a hurtful person , just passionate			0
@entity1 's brother , @entity255 , had a similar take			0
on @entity0 's " @entity177 , " he said @entity1 's latest comments were " out of line , " but said his brother is passionate and provocative			0
" so you put those two things together and it comes out the way you see it			0
i agree with him on some points , but i disagree vehemently on others			0
" @entity269 : @entity1 's comments ' should n't surprise anybody ' @entity0 's @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 contributed to this story .			0
