-- in 1966 , @entity2 soccer legend @entity1 booted a right - foot shot against @entity4 in the @entity6 championship game			1
the ball struck the top crossbar and rifled down near the goal line before spinning out			1
confusion ensued ; it was impossible to tell if the ball had crossed the plane			0
eventually , officials awarded the goal , and @entity16 secured its first and only @entity6 victory			1
try not to remind @entity19 fans			1
" they ca n't take it away now anyway , " @entity1 told @entity2 's @entity20 last year			0
" it is in the book			0
" he 's right , but soccer 's governing bodies are doing their best to ensure a similar controversy over a so - called " ghost goal " never happens again			1
and as fate would have it , they 're turning to a @entity19 company for help			1
a new system according to official estimates , @entity34 is paying a small @entity19 start - up nearly $ 3.5 million to operate its new goal - line technology in the @entity6 , which kicks off thursday in @entity38			1
the company , called @entity40 , would install 14 cameras in each of the 12 @entity6 stadiums that triangulate the motion of the ball with maximum precision : up to 500 images per second			1
with that tracking , plus sensors on the goal line , @entity40 can instantly alert a referee when the ball crosses the line			2
there 's no need to consult a replay booth or another official ; the referee in charge merely looks at their smartwatch			0
in other words , say " tchau " to ghost goals in @entity38			2
" the cameras are connected to a powerful image - processing computer system which tracks the movement of all objects on the pitch and filters out the players , referees and all disturbing objects , " a @entity40 representative said			2
if the system registers that the ball has crossed the goal line , it can send a vibration and a visual " goal " signal to referees ' watches within a second			1
@entity40 says the idea was developed by @entity84 , a company founder , after he attended a soccer match in @entity4 in which there was a dispute over a goal			2
he began contacting technicians the next day			0
for @entity92 's fellow @entity19 , though , the invention came nearly a half - century late			1
the tipping point for years , @entity34 president @entity94 dragged his feet before introducing technology to the soccer field			1
at various points , he complained it would lead to dramatic increases in play stoppage , or that it limits human officials			0
two things changed his mind : the quick , accurate nature of new systems such as @entity40 , and a high - profile controversy involving two familiar opponents			2
forty - four years after @entity1 's 1966 miracle , @entity4 met @entity16 during a @entity6 knockout match in @entity111			1
in the first half , @entity113 midfielder @entity112 sent a powerful strike toward the goal , which -- of course -- hit the top frame , dropped near the goal line , and bounced out			2
a goal was not given			0
unlike 1966 , however , instant replay revealed the truth : the ball had clearly crossed the line , and @entity16 was unjustly denied a goal			2
@entity4 won , 4 - 1			0
but for @entity34 and its president , it was the ultimate embarrassment			2
@entity94 said @entity112 's ghost goal was the moment he changed his mind			0
" for me as @entity34 president it became evident the moment what happened in @entity111 in 2010 , " he said at @entity34 headquarters after the incident			2
" ... i have to say ' thank you @entity112 '			0
i was completely down in @entity111 when i saw that it really shocked me , it took me a day to react			0
" debate rages on still , there are vocal opponents to introducing technology to soccer officiating			0
@entity146 president @entity145 is the most prominent			0
he controls popular @entity148 tournaments including the @entity149			0
earlier this year , @entity145 told @entity0 he remains staunchly against goal line technology , philosophically and practically			1
" i prefer that we have more referees to see if there is a penalty foul and if the ball is going over the line			0
we do n't need perfect cameras to see the ball , " he said			0
@entity145 also mentioned the high cost , estimating that implementing the technology in the @entity149 could cost â ‚ ¬ 52 million , or nearly $ 70 million			1
" i prefer to give these millions of @entity161 to grass - roots , to the young players in football , to some infrastructures so they can play football , " he said			0
cost is also a barrier for @entity169			1
in a statement , league officials said they have not found the right mix of ease , effectiveness and price concerning goal - line technology , although they support its use in theory			1
" we have met with multiple goal - line technology system manufacturers and have been carefully monitoring plans to implement the system , " the league said			1
" as of today , the time required to purchase , receive , install and properly test the equipment precludes @entity169 from considering the approved system for use , but we will continue to monitor the progress			1
" most professional @entity189 sports leagues use technology to aid officials in some form			0
most recently , @entity193 expanded its instant replay rules this season			0
at any rate , one man is overjoyed with the new technological developments : @entity6 hero @entity1			0
" if we had this system 50 years ago , it would have shown quite clearly the ball was at least a foot over the line , " he said .			1

after years of debate , @entity34 introduces goal - line technology to the @entity6
@entity19 start - up company selected , sells system to @entity34 for $ 3.5 million
high cost remains an implementation barrier for @entity146 , @entity169
@entity6 kicks off thursday in @entity38
