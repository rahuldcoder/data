foreign ministers from 11 countries meeting here cited the presence of foreign fighters in the country and the alleged use of chemical weapons by @entity8 in agreeing saturday to increase arms shipments to the rebels			0
in a statement , the ministers representing the " @entity12 11 , " an offshoot of the " @entity14 , " said they would " provide urgently all the necessary materiel and equipment to the opposition on the ground , each country in its own way in order to enable them to counter brutal attacks by the regime and its allies and protect the @entity24 people			1
" the weapons are to be funneled through the opposition @entity31 's @entity30 ( @entity30 )			2
the alleged use of chemical weapons , which president @entity36 has denied , and the involvement of @entity38 and @entity39 left the participants no choice " but to provide greater assistance of one kind or another , each nation making its own decision as to what it is comfortable doing , but all of them committing to do more to help the @entity24 opposition , " @entity33 secretary of state @entity32 told reporters			1
@entity32 called for a political settlement , not a military one , even as he expressed support for aiding the opposition			1
" president @entity59 made it clear that , as a result of the crossing of the red lines and the use of the chemical weapons , he was going to provide assistance that he has n't provided before , " @entity32 said without specifying what that aid would include			1
" we have said today very clearly we are going to step up in order to provide the capacity to the @entity30 and to the @entity24 opposition to be able to directly address the situation on the ground -- now , that 's as specific as i can be			1
" @entity32 said he hoped that plans for a second conference in @entity75 would soon coalesce			2
the @entity33 and @entity76 announced on may 7 they would try to bring the warring parties to a @entity75 - 2 conference to implement the peace plan they endorsed a year ago -- at what has come to be called @entity75 - 1 -- that left open the question of whether @entity36 must leave power			0
but in their statement on saturday , the ministers reiterated their call for negotiations that would lead to the establishment of a transitional governing body " that excludes the central figures and associates whose hands are stained with blood			0
in this context , @entity36 has no role in the transitional governing body or thereafter			0
" " the implementation of @entity99 is the goal of @entity75 - 2 , and that is a transition government with full executive authority , which gives the @entity24 people as a whole , everybody in @entity24 , the chance to have a new beginning where they choose their future leadership , " @entity32 told @entity97 last week			1
next week , @entity112 @entity111 and ambassador @entity113 will meet with their @entity76 counterparts and @entity116 , the @entity117 special envoy to @entity24 , to set a date for the meeting , @entity32 said			1
the broadening of the conflict and the possibility that it will devolve into a sectarian war raise concerns that the conflict will widen beyond @entity24 's borders , he said			1
" it is our hope that , indeed , we will avoid a regional war			0
" @entity32 noted that @entity131 has been sending arms to the government in @entity8 , but said he believed that president @entity134 was prepared to support the @entity75 meeting			1
the diplomatic group , known as the @entity137 , met in @entity138 to figure out how to shift the balance of power on the @entity24 battlefield away from @entity36 and toward the opposition			1
@entity142 has the upper hand militarily , due to his access to air power and heavy artillery , including tanks			0
rebel forces have no air power and few heavy weapons			0
but @entity24 rebels said this week that they have received anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles from " brotherly nations that support the @entity24 revolution			1
" @entity156 is providing more than $ 815 million in humanitarian assistance to victims of the conflict and has committed $ 250 million in nonlethal aid to the @entity24 opposition			2
the @entity162 is training @entity24 rebel forces at bases in @entity165 , according to senior @entity33 officials			2
combatants from other countries are also aiding the opposition			0
foreign @entity171 militants are joining the ranks of the rebels			0
one of the largest groups , the @entity175 , is affiliated with @entity176 in neighboring @entity177			0
some 5,000 @entity179 fighters from @entity38 have taken up arms in @entity24 in support of the government , according to sen. @entity183 , @entity184			2
