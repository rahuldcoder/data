-- the attorney representing the @entity3 soldier suspected in the @entity5 massacre of 16 villagers , including nine children , is a flamboyant , pugnacious trial lawyer who does n't shy from the hardest of hard - core cases			1
as commanding in physical stature as he is in the courtroom , the 6 1/2 - foot - tall @entity9 has defended serial killer @entity12 , who confessed to more than 30 murders before he was executed in @entity14 in 1989			1
the @entity16 attorney also defended @entity17 , convicted for his 1983 role in 13 murders in the @entity21 massacre , described then as @entity23 's worst mass killing			2
on a less grisly scale , @entity24 recently represented the so - called " @entity26 " -- @entity26 -- the @entity27 - loving and occasionally barefoot 20 - year - old man who gained a cult status among the @entity30 generation for a string of audacious thefts and burglaries			1
he has pleaded guilty to federal and state charges			0
now , @entity24 returns to his element , drawing international cameras as an attorney defending a suspect in one of mankind 's most heinous offenses -- an alleged war atrocity			1
the suspect is @entity45 staff sgt. @entity44 , a military source and a senior defense official told @entity0			1
@entity24 said his client , whom he would n't name , was expected to arrive in the @entity3 friday evening , in @entity48 , @entity49			1
even without any formal military charges being filed in the @entity5 mass killings , @entity24 is demonstrating his prowess as a confident provocateur -- his trademark mien -- by publicly formulating before news cameras possible defenses for the soldier			1
his office receptionist said friday that @entity24 is now receiving media requests from " all over the world			1
" @entity24 's willingness to openly advance defense strategies , however , has already drawn criticism from legal experts , especially those in military justice			1
@entity24 has suggested that the soldier , who had earlier suffered a concussion in @entity69 , could have been suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome , and @entity24 wondered why the military deployed the soldier to @entity5			1
in criticizing the military for repeated war deployments of weary soldiers , he even singled out one military base in @entity23 for " not treating those illnesses , " referring to @entity77			2
" there 's been a big problem with soldiers who have been previously deployed to both @entity69 and @entity5 , with concussive head injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder , " @entity24 said			1
" we do know he had a concussive head injury			0
we know he was injured in his leg severely , and i am somewhat confused to why they would send him back to @entity5 , " he said			1
in another @entity0 interview , @entity24 momentarily suggested that he may put the war itself on trial -- if his client is ever charged in military court			1
@entity24 has tried more than 250 cases since graduating from @entity97 in 1971			2
" you know , i 'm old enough to remember the @entity99 in @entity100 and how that hastened the end of that war			0
maybe a tragic incident such as this will get people to rethink the war in general , " @entity24 said			2
then he added : " i certainly do n't want to put the war on trial , but i think that people should start thinking more about why we 're there and how long we 're going to stay there			0
" when pressed in a @entity0 interview about putting the war on trial , @entity24 stated : " we 'll see			2
" @entity118 , an attorney who represented soldiers in military court in @entity69 in 2005 , took exception with @entity24 's comments			1
" with all due respect , i think it 's ill advised , " @entity118 told @entity0			0
" you do n't want to say anything at this point where you 'll over-commit " to a defense			0
" maybe alcohol is going to play a big part in this case as part of establishing a defense , as part of establishing a contributing factor to ( post-traumatic stress ) or the command environment in theater that condoned these sort of excesses that may have contributed to this tragic offense , " he said			0
@entity24 said he was asked by the soldier 's family to represent him			1
he said he had reservations about taking on the case , given security concerns			0
in describing his client , @entity24 painted a picture of a decorated career soldier who joined the military after the 2001 terrorist attacks and had spent his @entity45 life at @entity152 near @entity153 , @entity23			1
@entity24 called him a devoted husband and father to his two young children who never made any derogatory remarks about @entity159 or @entity5			1
@entity24 said he was offended by media reports that marital discord played a role in the events that unfolded in @entity165 province villages near the small combat outpost where the soldier was stationed			1
he said those reports were " nonsense			0
" he said he did not know whether alcohol may have been involved , which investigators are looking into , but imagined that stress was a factor			0
" for @entity176 's sake , who is not going to be under stress in @entity5 in a small camp where there is 20 people in the middle of nowhere ? " @entity24 asked			1
he also said that , the day before the slayings , another soldier on that base had his leg shot off in front of the suspect			2
" that affected the whole base , " @entity24 said			2
charges against his client could come within weeks in what @entity24 called more of a political case than a legal one			2
" this is an international event , and it 's a very touchy event for our government and for other governments , " he said			0
" it 's not just a normal criminal case that we deal with , and we understand that			0
we understand our government 's concern about it , and we certainly understand the concern of @entity5 and its people			2
this ( is ) a pretty huge case from the standpoint of ramifications			0
" the soldier is accused of leaving the remote outpost of @entity215 on foot early sunday and heading to neighboring villages in the @entity219 district of @entity165 province			0
in the villages , a @entity3 soldier opened fire , killing nine children , three women and four men , witnesses and @entity5 authorities said			1
the @entity3 military has not confirmed the number of casualties			0
the soldier 's family has been moved to @entity152 because of safety concerns , @entity24 said			1
@entity24 also confirmed reports that the soldier could face the death penalty			1
" there is a discussion of the death penalty , understandably , i think , in this situation , which makes us very nervous , " he said			0
" it 's certainly not off the table at this point			0
our hope is that maybe it will be			0
" we do n't know anything about ( his ) state of mind			0
we do n't know anything about the facts of the case , and whether they can prove what he 's accused of , " @entity24 said			2
in a 1998 profile of @entity24 , the @entity256 described the high - profile attorney as " a blend of charm and arrogance , spirituality and bravado " and " a gifted storyteller who can be glib and funny or somber and dramatic " who has a " combative style and robust ego			1
" a @entity270 justice once remarked that @entity24 needed to be spanked , the newspaper reported			2
@entity24 's home at the time featured @entity274 motifs , built in @entity276 style with @entity278 prayer stones			1
he meditated and read the poetry of @entity281 , a 13th - century spiritual writer			0
" people take their freedom for granted , " @entity24 told the newspaper in 1998			2
" they do n't teach civics anymore			0
they do n't realize how delicate the system is			0
it is a simple equation : the more power you give to government , the less power you give to individuals			0
" @entity0 's @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 contributed to this report .			0
