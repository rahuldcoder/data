the defense team criticized the charges as being vague			0
" in many ways , how he was linked to terrorism , and how it was classified as premeditated murder -- i think for the defense team , the charges are disproportionate and too far from the truth , " said @entity60 , one of the defense lawyers			0
@entity1 authorities allege that @entity9 admitted his role in the @entity7 attacks to investigators , saying he helped assemble the explosives			1
@entity70 , an @entity1 terrorism expert , told @entity2 that @entity9 's detention and trial " should go beyond the @entity7 bombings			1
" " @entity9 is a gold mine of information for security authorities , not only here in @entity1 , but also in @entity78 , @entity79 , and the @entity80			1
he has valuable information about the extent of the network , who are the people moving from one place to another and how they 're doing it , " @entity70 said			0
