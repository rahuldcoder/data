a @entity4 man is suing police for allegedly " subjecting him to multiple digital penetrations and three enemas , " among other " shockingly invasive medical procedures " -- all on an invalid warrant , all without finding any drugs -- his lawyers claim			1
the lawsuit states that @entity12 , 54 , spent more than 12 hours in custody last january at a police station and local hospital after being pulled over for a traffic violation			1
yet he was never charged , nor did authorities find illicit substances on him			0
" @entity21 acted completely outside the bounds of human decency by orchestrating wholly superfluous physical body cavity searches performed by an unethical medical professional , " states the lawsuit , which was filed earlier this year but has garnered more public attention in recent days			0
police in @entity27 , @entity4 , did not return multiple messages left by @entity29 on wednesday seeking their side of the story			2
the city attorney 's office also did not offer an immediate comment after being contacted wednesday			0
according to a police affidavit accompanying the lawsuit , a detective asked a different officer to pull over @entity12 's 1998 brown @entity40 pickup truck for not properly stopping at a stop sign			0
after @entity12 was pulled over , a @entity27 police officer said that he saw @entity12 " was avoiding eye contact with me , " his " left hand began to shake , " and he stood " erect ( with ) his legs together , " the affidavit stated			0
@entity12 was told he could go home after a third officer issued him a traffic citation			0
but before he did , @entity12 voluntarily consented to a search of him and his vehicle , the affidavit states			0
a k - 9 dog subsequently hit on a spot in the @entity40 's driver 's seat , though no drugs were found			0
" @entity60 k - 9 officer did inform me that he had dealt with mr. @entity12 on a previous case and stated that mr. @entity12 was known to insert drugs into his anal cavity and had been caught in @entity65 with drugs in his anal cavity , " the affidavit said			1
while @entity29 could not immediately corroborate that claim , a search of @entity12 's criminal history found he 's been arrested several times on drug possession charges , though many of those charges were dismissed			1
outrage over highway body cavity search @entity12 was then put in " investigative detention " and transported around 2 p.m. to the @entity77			2
sometime after that , a judge signed off a search warrant " to include but not limited to his anal cavity			1
" the next stop was @entity82 , where the lawsuit states " no drugs were found " in " an x-ray and two digital searches of his rectum by two different doctors			2
" one doctor at this time found nothing unusual in his stool			0
three enemas were conducted on @entity12 after 10:20 p.m. a chest x-ray followed , succeeded by a colonoscopy around 1:25 a.m. after all this , " no drugs were found in or on @entity99 's person , " according to the lawsuit			1
because he " merely looked nervous during a traffic stop , " the lawsuit claims that authorities ended up violating @entity12 's constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures on a number of grounds			1
one was that " the language in the warrant was overly broad and , therefore , invalid , " said the plaintiff , asserting that the chest x-ray and colonoscopy , for instance , were n't related or confined to the " anal cavity			1
" moreover , many of the tests took place outside the 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. timeframe for which any such search warrant ( unless otherwise authorized ) is legally valid under @entity4 law , according to the lawsuit			1
" while the war on drugs has resulted in aggressive government tactics , " the suit added , " the @entity128 has never authorized the seizing of an alleged drug user for forced medical procedures to purge their bodies of drugs			2
" @entity128 blocks ruling that altered @entity135 's stop - and - frisk policy			0

police got a warrant for an " anal cavity " search ; lawsuit claims it was too *general* and broad
he had " digital penetrations , *...* 3 enemas " and a colonoscopy ; no drugs were found , no charges
