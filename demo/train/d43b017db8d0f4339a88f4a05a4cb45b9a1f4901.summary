sen. @entity0 , @entity2 - @entity1 , has some harsh words for the recently released @entity5 report , led by his own party			1
" i think the report is full of crap , " @entity0 told @entity7 on @entity9 's " @entity8 " on sunday			2
" i do n't believe that the report is accurate , given the role that @entity14 ( deputy director of the @entity16 at the time ) played in misleading the @entity18 on two different occasions			2
why did n't the report say that ? " the investigative report @entity0 is referring to was released friday by @entity24 chairman @entity23 , @entity25 , and ranking member rep. @entity26 , @entity27			1
the report finds little to support the questions that have been raised about @entity16 actions on the ground in @entity5 the night of the deadly attack on september 11 , 2012			0
@entity0 , who has maintained a critical voice in the @entity5 controversy over the past two years , says it 's " garbage " that the report finds no members of the @entity39 administration lied to cover up what happened in @entity5			1
" that 's a bunch of garbage , " @entity0 said			0
" that 's a complete bunch of garbage			0
" the investigation also found the security at the diplomatic outpost was weak and also described a " flawed " process used to create talking points for @entity24 members and for then - @entity52 ambassador @entity51 , whose public statements after the attack incensed critics who said the administration was trying to avoid calling the attack terrorism			0
" when @entity51 was on television after the attack , she said on three different occasions the consulate was strongly , and significantly secure , " @entity0 said			0
" nothing could be further than that from the truth , and there 's nothing in the talking points about the level of security			0
" to conclude , @entity0 says the findings of the report prove the @entity24 " is doing a lousy job policing their own			1
" " anybody who has followed @entity5 at all knows that the @entity16 deputy director did not come forward to tell @entity18 what role he played in changing the talking points and the only way we knew he was involved is when he told a representative at the @entity24 , " @entity0 said			1
asked why the @entity83 chairman of the @entity24 would be " buying a bunch of garbage , " @entity0 simply replied , " good question			1
" @entity0 said he is going to take another look at the findings of the report			2
" i 'm going to do a hard review of this			0

@entity1 @entity83 sen. @entity0 : " i do n't believe that the report is accurate "
he says the @entity24 left out critical *information*
@entity0 says " is doing a lousy job policing their own "
