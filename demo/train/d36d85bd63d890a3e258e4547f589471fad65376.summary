@entity0 likes ornithology and " @entity2			0
" he 's quite the gentleman , and hates being late for tea			0
for potential admirers , it 's important to note that @entity0 is a cat			1
he is one of the stars of @entity9 's first cat cafe , @entity10 , which opened on monday to much fanfare and a full reservation book			1
the cats that purr and pounce while patrons sip coffee and nosh on pastries are n't just there for added ambiance -- they 're hoping to get adopted			1
@entity0 's portrait hangs on the wall with those tongue - in - cheek compatibility stats , alongside other potential matches like @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			2
their personalities are classified in types like " bookish " for the reserved cat or " cheerleader " for a more high - energy , friendly one			2
but being billed as a novelty cat cafe merely scratches the surface , say cafe founders @entity36 and @entity38			1
" i think we 'll feel really like we 've made it when we get our first cat adopted , " @entity36 said			2
she and @entity38 teamed up with @entity42 , a no - kill , volunteer - run adoption group , in order to uniquely brand their cafe but also give it an altruistic twist			1
@entity50 currently takes in between 500 and 600 cats a year , with 27 cages in a @entity54 branch of a pet store and a network of foster homes			2
the duo were inspired by similar concepts in places like @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , but did n't just want to jump on the bandwagon for the sake of pulling the heartstrings of cat lovers to sell more lattes			0
they wanted to give back by way of " fur - ever " homes			0
@entity36 rescued two cats , mr. @entity73 and @entity74 -- the latter from @entity42 -- and decided to partner with the organization after @entity10 was a go			2
" it brings tears to my eyes to see @entity26 there , " says @entity79 , who serves on @entity50 's board of directors and is an adoption counselor			1
@entity79 says @entity42 is particularly committed to helping cats with special needs , whether disease , old age or disability			0
for a cat to be placed in the cafe , it has to have a clean bill of health , get along with other cats and be nonaggressive			1
she says it 's really an opportunity to showcase a cat that might get depressed or hissy in a cage and , therefore , be overlooked by an adopter elsewhere			0
" if you 're sitting at the cat cafe and you 're having a cup of coffee and this beautiful 10 - year - old calico cat comes and rubs up against your leg , and you 're someone who is open to adopting , you 're just as likely to have your heart connect to that cat as @entity0 , who is 10 months old , " @entity79 says			1
@entity36 and @entity79 agree that the cafe is a boon for both species			0
the ultimate goal is that after an afternoon of cat companionship , a patron will want to extend that short - term visit into a lifelong relationship			0
@entity79 says the application process is exactly the same as going through @entity123 's shelter : there 's an application , interview , home visit and adoption fee of $ 125 to cover medical costs			0
as for the health code regulations relating to animals , @entity36 worked closely with the @entity132 in the planning stages			1
there is a separate storefront around the corner , the @entity137 , where customers can purchase baked goods and beverages to bring into the cafe			1
and yes , they do have lint rollers .			0

@entity10 , @entity9 's first cat cafe , is now open
the cafe 's founders teamed up with the no - kill adoption group @entity50
coffee and pastries are made and sold at a separate storefront to meet health code regulations
