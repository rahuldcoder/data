@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was playing pool in 1993 when his life changed forever			1
he was lining up a bank shot when he felt something on his wrist : a handcuff			0
@entity10 was arrested for the rape and kidnapping of a housekeeper			0
" i instantly said , ' no , you 've got the wrong guy , ' " @entity10 recalls telling detectives			0
but detectives believed the victim 's testimony , although she was blindfolded for most of the attack			0
a jury agreed , sentencing @entity10 , a father of three children under age 6 , to 23 years in prison			1
from behind bars , @entity10 tried to prove police had the wrong guy			2
in 2000 , he contacted the @entity29 at the @entity30 in @entity31			1
for years , prosecutors denied the project 's requests to use more advanced dna testing on the evidence in @entity10 's case			2
in 2005 , a new state law gave judges the power to order additional testing			0
but it took five more years for @entity10 's testing to be completed and for a court to consider the results that conclusively showed another man 's dna was on the victim			2
in 2010 , @entity10 , still sitting in prison , got a letter with news he thought he might never get			2
" i was jumping around the day room saying , ' i 'm out of here ! i 'm out of here ! ' " @entity3 said			1
he walked out of prison a few months later , an experience he could barely describe			2
it was like every emotion you 've ever had , it was so overwhelming , he said			0
but because he was convicted in @entity1 , @entity10 got little more than that feeling when he was released			2
like 23 other states across the country , @entity1 provides no compensation for those who have been wrongfully convicted			1
@entity10 left prison with less than $ 2,500 , money he had been sent while in prison and wages from his 42 - cent - an - hour prison job			1
had he been wrongfully convicted in one of the 27 states that do provide compensation , @entity10 could have received hundreds of thousands of dollars for his 17 years behind bars			1
state standards vary according to an @entity29 study , @entity10 is among the 40 % of exonerated prisoners nationwide who received nothing from authorities for their time behind bars			1
the report calls for all states to pass laws providing the same compensation that the federal government offers for federal crimes : $ 50,000 per year of wrongful incarceration with an additional $ 50,000 for each year spent on death row			1
today , five states have the same standard			0
money would give @entity10 a chance to " just get started over again and have a normal life again , " he said			0
he works full - time but lives in a small room in a friend 's house because he ca n't afford his own apartment			0
even in the states that do offer compensation to the innocent , standards vary wildly			1
some pay $ 50,000 per year			1
two pay more ( @entity107 and @entity108 ) , but others less			0
@entity110 pays $ 5,000 per year while @entity111 pays $ 50 per day			1
@entity112 sets an award cap of $ 20,000 while other states set a maximum of $ 500,000 , $ 1 million or no limit			1
does your state compensate the wrongly convicted ? according to the @entity29 , exonerated prisoners who are eligible for compensation wait an average three years to receive their money			1
most states tax the money , according to the @entity124			0
exonerees denied right to benefits " there 's sort of a gut reaction that this is a horrible injustice , " said @entity29 attorney @entity127 , who helped free @entity10			1
she is lobbying for a law in @entity1 that would provide not only compensation for exonerated prisoners but also counseling , job training and other benefits that are currently available only to guilty former prisoners , not exonerees like @entity10			1
some tasks , like learning new technology or finding transportation , can be difficult for someone who has been out of society for a decade or more			0
@entity127 is also pushing for mental and physical health care benefits for exonerees			0
@entity1 agencies " just say flat out they 're not eligible because they were n't actually guilty so they do n't qualify , they do n't fit our criteria , " @entity127 said			0
nationwide , 10 states provide social services to help the innocent recover from their time in prison			2
" it 's not all about the money , " @entity3 said			2
" it 's about possible counseling for certain individuals			0
... people have no idea what effect stress has on a person in there			0
... what that does to a mindset is just devastating			0

after 17 years behind bars , @entity3 released with funds from prison job , gifts
almost half of all states fail to compensate people wrongly *imprisoned*
other states pay ranges from $ 5,000 a year to nearly $ *100,000* a year
@entity29 is lobbying for *increased* compensation , job training , counseling
