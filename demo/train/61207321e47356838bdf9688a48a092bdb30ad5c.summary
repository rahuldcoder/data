" let the @entity9 jokes ensue			2
the @entity6 news source @entity11 reports that @entity12 and @entity13 are the proud parents of a bouncing baby girl named after the @entity17 button , which recently celebrated its first birthday			1
apparently , the parents were looking to call their daughter something unique			1
the moniker is not meant to be a gimmick , and they say that they 're not shilling for @entity2			1
they just like ( pun intended ) the meaning behind the name			0
the @entity28 are hardly the first people to saddle their kid with a suspect name			0
one man offered to name his son @entity31 if he could get 500,000 people to become fans of his @entity34 , and another couple named their child @entity2 in honor of the role the social network played in the revolution in @entity41			2
granted , naming your child something unusual is not relegated to the realm of social media -- apparently " @entity50 " is an extremely popular name -- but the name choice certainly is out there			0
what do you think ? would you " like " the name like ? see the original article on @entity0 Â© 2013 @entity0			0
