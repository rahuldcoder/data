-- summer is a great time to barbecue , hit the beach or get out and explore the town			0
but for gamers it 's often a huge disappointment , as the flow of new releases generally slows to a trickle			0
mercifully , software publishers are beginning to wise up and use the slower months to issue an increasing number of promising but less high - profile releases that may otherwise have slipped beneath the radar			1
the following are among my top picks for the season -- sure to keep you happy while others fret about trivialities like fresh air and exercise			0
@entity24 owners can spare themselves the trouble of getting off the couch and download selections , like these three , from @entity28			0
due out july 28 , @entity30 's " @entity29 : @entity38 " is a classic , 2 - @entity33 monster mash that combines elements of platform - hopping and adventure to atmospheric effect			1
" @entity43 , " is a sequel to the blistering arcade speedboat racer that sees multiple wheelmen competing to cross the finish line			0
it even allows multiple players to tag - team the adventure			2
completing a trifecta of notable , multiplayer - ready sequels , " @entity52 " spin - off " @entity53 " ( pc and @entity50 versions are available , too			1
) also lets you explore , do battle and solve puzzles in the company of friends -- no sleepovers required			0
on the retail front , be sure to check out " @entity63 " for @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity24 and @entity67			1
the latest installment in the football franchise streamlines decision - making and play - calling , making for a faster , more engaging virtual gridiron experience			1
spy thriller " @entity78 " will also satisfy @entity49 , @entity65 and @entity24 fans ' inner @entity73 , combining exotic settings , in - depth character customization and detailed stat - crunching with atmospheric espionage			1
sci - fi fans should also have a look at " transformers : @entity82 " on the pc and all major console platforms			1
it 's predictable , but delves deeper into the @entity87 ' and @entity88 ' origins			0
@entity90 blaster " @entity91 " for the @entity24 is sure to make you feel positively superhuman , too , leaping tall buildings and annihilating adversaries as a futuristic lawman			0
golden age mob yarn " @entity97 " for pc , @entity65 and @entity24 further makes an offer you ca n't refuse , offering open - ended adventures in the vein of underworld classics like " @entity103			1
" handheld gaming enthusiasts also have it good thanks to titles like " @entity108 " for the @entity109 and @entity110 , which blends fantasy role - playing and casual mindbenders together in a surprisingly addictive medieval epic			1
creepy @entity109 first - person survival horror outing " @entity118 " will additionally have you on the edge of your car or plane seat as well			2
while the @entity66 's lineup is noticeably more anemic , military - themed stealth action offering " metal gear solid : @entity122 " successfully shoots to thrill			2
demonic role - player " @entity124 : @entity129 " should be on every fan of @entity128 imports ' list to boot			2
so , maybe summer ca n't compete with the holidays in terms of sheer volume of games			0
but never fear -- the gaming season is still bound to be hot .			0
