-- @entity1 has taken the next lunge in the debate on air travel and overweight fliers with a new extra-large seat for extra-wide passengers			1
" the new seat is like a two - person couch , created from two adjacent seats without an armrest , " the airline 's ceo @entity8 told @entity0			1
the new seat will also have 14 inches of extra legroom , created by the removal of the row in front			1
the initiative includes the adoption of a boarding ramp , as opposed to steps			1
" most people around 130 kilos ( 285 pounds ) struggle to get up most steps , so we 've redesigned ours into a ramp to help bigger passengers get to their seats , " said @entity8			1
the tiny airline -- its fleet consists of three planes , each with 10 seats or fewer -- already operates the airline industry 's only pay - as - you - weigh pricing scheme , which charges passengers according to their combined body and luggage weight			1
it transports some of the world 's biggest travelers			2
a 2007 @entity46 report claimed 80 % of @entity47 are overweight , and it 's unlikely things have improved since then			2
" some of our customers top out at 210 kilos ( 460 pounds ) , " @entity8 said			1
" many come in around 160 kilos and around 40 % in the 100 - 130 kilo range			2
" pay more get more @entity8 said the move -- which will become operational in one of the airline 's planes on june 26 -- is meant to offset extra costs incurred under the controversial pay - as - you - weigh plan and acts as a trial for potential implementation in other aircraft			1
" because some bigger passengers will be paying more , we want them to be comfortable , " said @entity8			2
" it 's a precursor to what will happen to our 100 - seater planes , which we 'll start operating in three to six months			0
" data on passenger weight collected by the airline since november show that for every 50 passengers they fly , three to four will weigh 160 kilos ( 352 pounds ) or more			1
the pay - as - you - weigh scheme has been criticized for condoning unhealthy eating by travelers			2
" airplanes run on weight , whether that 's healthy weight or unhealthy , " he said			0
" our problem is putting that weight on seats and the fact that different people weigh different amounts			1
it 's completely separate from the issue of health			0
" the airline recently set up a scheme with a local fitness center in which members who lose weight at the gym receive @entity1 vouchers giving them three kilos for the price of one -- a 66 % saving			1
weigh in and pay up the airline 's fee structure allows travelers to enter their approximate weight and that of their luggage and prepay based on that " guesstimate			2
" a @entity113 economist recently published a paper advocating the practice			0
some travelers have criticized the weight - based fare concept as a " fat tax			0
" others believe it 's fair			0
" yes , if i am getting less than 100 % of the seat i paid for , the person taking my space should have to make up the difference , " a @entity0 commenter wrote			0
for a tiny carrier like @entity1 , the fare model seems reasonable , according to airline analyst @entity129 , a partner at @entity130 , a transportation investment research firm			1
" for this small operation , specifically with the aircraft they fly , weight restrictions are the key practical problem they have to deal with on every flight			0
they have a solid business case to charge for weight , " @entity129 said			0
but travelers are unlikely to see anything like it on a large @entity144 airline , he said			0
" for @entity144 airlines , i think this is an issue they will not touch with a 10 - foot pole because of the negative publicity and the practical purposes of weighing people at the gate			0
" @entity0 's @entity153 and @entity154 contributed to this report			0

new " couch " will combine two seats and have 14 inches of extra legroom
some passengers on @entity1 weigh up to 210 kilos ( 460 pounds )
initiative includes ramp access to seats in place of steps
