there was nothing simple about @entity3			1
except that he was simply the best			2
as @entity8 @entity7 wrote of @entity9 , the best of the " whole damn bunch			2
" he 'd started in @entity12 and never seemed to stop			2
hurling himself into the breach			0
and the pain -- time and time again			0
how many plane rides ? how many careening cars ? how many kisses to loved ones goodbye ? how many bullets ? how many bombs ? how many tragedies and tears ? @entity3 saw everything with keen , fresh eyes			1
he died at 73 , still curious , still doing the work , boarding the planes , asking the questions , writing the stories and making them sing			1
he was a warrior poet , a traveling wordsmith whose voice was shaped by all he 'd seen			0
barbarism , brutality , compassion , kindness -- @entity3 knew it 's often intertwined			1
he bore witness , captured moments and saw details others routinely missed			0
he also wrote sentences we had not heard -- showed us stories we had not seen -- and we were lucky he came our way			0
for many of us , he was the correspondent we dreamed of being , the writer we wished we were			1
not too long ago , he wrote a piece for " @entity55 " about a choir in @entity57			0
in a place known for poverty , @entity3 found an ode to joy			1
on this sad , senseless day , perhaps it 's best to remember that .			0
