i 'm one of the lucky ones			0
i landed a tenure - track job at a liberal arts college , a position that offers lots of personal interaction through teaching and advising			1
i get to bond with my students not only in the classroom , but also on nature retreats , at national conferences , and during travel seminars to other countries			0
when my students graduate , they tell me excitedly about their job offers and their acceptance letters to graduate school			0
i have a wonderful job			0
but my story is the exception			0
if higher education continues down its current path , full - time professors — already an endangered species — may become extinct			1
the reason : uncontrollable fervor for online education			1
according to a jaw - dropping 2013 report by the @entity29 , the percentage of tenure track ( i.e. , permanent , full - time ) positions has plummeted from 78 % in 1969 to about 33 % today			1
the report warns that " the rising numbers of non-tenure - track faculty in higher education are negatively affecting student success			1
" even before the online revolution , full - time professor jobs were already on the decline as colleges and universities came to rely on an army of inexpensive adjunct instructors			1
@entity46 , an @entity47 professor and columnist for @entity49 , notes that adjuncts make about $ 2,700 per class , " without job security , benefits , academic freedom , or any say in institutional governance			0
" but large - scale online education initiatives may do even more harm to the profession of full - time college teaching			1
in the 2012 book " @entity64 of the @entity65 , " @entity61 along with co-author @entity62 , argue that online learning is a direct cause of the rapid decrease in full - time , tenure - track positions			1
@entity61 , the retired provost of the @entity70 , believes online learning can be saved , but he says it 's going in the wrong direction			2
" as online learning has grown , tenure has declined , " @entity61 told me			2
" as technology has removed jobs from other sectors , such as finance and publishing , it is doing the same thing in higher education			1
but because we are labor intensive and low - tech , it got to us late			2
" when done right , online education can be a helpful complement to traditional classrooms			1
for example , my employer , @entity92 , has found a great balance between small online courses and traditional education			1
but in this season of economic uncertainty , the urge to convert traditional classes into impersonal , large - scale online courses is becoming irresistible to colleges and universities less committed to the sacred bond between teacher and student			1
the result ? fewer full - time professors			1
in the short term , it cuts costs			0
but in the long term , it could destroy @entity115 's higher education system			1
quite depressingly , some online education experts have already disposed of the word " professor			1
" " the roles of those who decide to stay in higher education will shift to things such as content specialists , course facilitators , course designers and researchers , " said @entity119 , instructional design specialist at @entity121 and co-author of " @entity123 : how @entity132			2
" @entity119 believes a world without traditional professors is imminent			0
" the job of the college professor as we know it will continue to exist in elite institutions , but in most cases it will cease to exist , " he said			0
" i predict that the change will come more rapidly than we can structurally or emotionally accommodate			0
" sometime in the future , @entity119 predicts an improved higher education system , with better accountability and increased access for economically disadvantaged students			1
but in the meantime , @entity119 said : " if our main concern is the happiness and well - being of professors , i 'm afraid bad news is coming			2
" bad news , indeed			0
in a recent @entity160 article , " private colleges squeezed , " @entity155 , the vice president of enrollment management at @entity157 in @entity158 , predicted that 30 % of small , non-elite private colleges will vanish in the next decade			0
the ones who survive " will have to learn to live with less , " he told the @entity160			0
online education advocates often tout studies that supposedly show that online classrooms are just as effective as traditional classrooms			2
but loan default rates at online - only institutions tell another story			2
for years , we 've seen reports that students from for - profit universities , which specialize in large - scale online models , have loan default rates that are much higher than those from nonprofit schools			1
in 2010 , @entity180 sen. @entity179 of @entity181 published " @entity182 " in which he stated that nearly a quarter of students from for - profit institutions default on their loans within three years			0
the @entity186 subsequently launched an investigation and found deceptive recruiting practices at many of the largest universities in the online for - profit sector			2
nevertheless , the mad scramble to contain costs by using large - scale online classes continues unabated			1
between 2008 and 2013 , the number of college students taking at least one online course nearly doubled , to 45 % , according to a survey by @entity196			0
while only 2.6 % of higher education institutions currently have a " massive open online course , " or @entity201 , more than 9 % are planning for it , according to a study by @entity204			1
the logic seems to be : " why hire your own ph.d. when you can show pre-recorded lectures to students hundreds of miles away , and then have their tests graded by a computer ? " not all online education experts believe the job of full - time professor needs to vanish			1
@entity61 , for example , argues that by preserving tenure and keeping online classes small , universities can adapt to an online culture without losing their essence			2
" i have watched mbas use new management theories to make colleges more efficient , " @entity61 told me			0
" but higher education should not be efficient			2
fast food restaurants are efficient			0
" @entity230 , associate professor of communication at @entity232 in @entity233 , believes there will be a backlash against online courses done on the cheap			2
she predicts that negative experiences with impersonal programs will ultimately drive students into the arms of institutions focused on teaching and personal interaction			0
" saying that the @entity201 are a solution to everything is the equivalent of saying , ' there 's the public library			0
go get an education , ' " @entity230 said			0
for the sake of both students and professors , i hope @entity230 is right			0
i hope the job of full - time professor does n't go the way of the dinosaur			1
but i see an asteroid coming .			0

@entity261 : tenure - track full - time professors are an endangered species
@entity261 : blame it on the fervor for large - scale online education initiatives
he says colleges are embracing online courses for cost - cutting reasons
@entity261 : but in the long term they could destroy @entity115 's higher education system
