the new film " @entity9 " is a love song to nuclear power that claims to be a documentary , but like all good propaganda it omits key parts of the story , overstates the positives and underplays the negatives			1
built around the ( false ) proposition that improved quality of life requires commensurate growth in energy use ( a recurring visual theme is a globe that glows brighter and brighter ) , the movie presents nuclear power as the only plausible solution to global warming			1
no @entity22 utility today would consider building a new nuclear power plant without massive government support			1
of 29 power plants on the drawing boards in 2009 , only a handful are going forward , with government help , and even those are experiencing delays and cost overruns			2
no major @entity22 environmental group endorses nuclear power as a solution to climate change caused by fossil fuels , but this movie lionizes environmental activists who have become nuclear power enthusiasts , led by @entity40 and @entity41			1
@entity40 notes in the film that he at one time worked for @entity44 and other major environmental groups in a consulting role			2
their narratives are juxtaposed against unflattering , decades - old clips of veteran anti-nuclear activists like @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , suggesting that being pro-nuke is modern and hip			0
one of us , @entity56 , was among about 50 people who attended a screening at @entity59 , home to the film 's science adviser , @entity63 - winning physicist @entity61			0
those in the mostly empty auditorium heard one of the movie 's principal funders -- tech entrepreneur @entity66 -- tell the audience beforehand that outspoken climate scientist @entity71 was an inspiration for the film			2
@entity66 said it was @entity71 who first alerted him to the promise of the @entity76 , which is an advanced reactor design intended to operate more safely and produce less hazardous waste than today 's plants			2
@entity71 certainly would not agree , however , with the film 's curt dismissal of the potential contributions of energy efficiency and renewable energy resources to meeting global energy needs			0
opinion : are environmental leaders steering us toward disaster ? @entity76 and @entity90 the still - unrealized @entity76 is the real star of the film , along with the nation of @entity90 , whose nuclear generation program is extolled as " one of the most inspiring stories ever " ( " the trains are electric powered , they have clean air , and they have the cheapest electricity in @entity102 " )			1
nuclear power debates are the only places where you will ever see those at the conservative edge of the political spectrum argue that the @entity22 should reorganize its economy to be more like @entity90			1
the @entity111 administration killed the @entity76 in 1994 because of concern over the potential diversion of the plutonium fuel by terrorists and non-nuclear weapon states of concern			2
yet the film 's closing argument is that a " fourth - generation " reactor modeled on the @entity76 will sweep the globe , burning waste created by the first three generations and " solving " the nagging problem of long - term disposal of nuclear waste			1
the film fails to mention that this would take hundreds to thousands of plutonium - fueled reactors operating over hundreds of years , resulting most likely in an increase in the releases of radioactivity to the environment as a consequence of operations by the @entity76 's fuel processing and fabricating facilities			1
the film invokes @entity137 as one of many forward - thinking new investors in nuclear innovation , but surely even @entity137 would recoil from the @entity76 's poor economic outlook compared to conventional reactors and the financial risks associated with building just one @entity76 , let alone a global fleet of them			1
the film fails to acknowledge that the flagship fast reactor development efforts in the @entity22 , @entity90 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 all failed , and that fast reactors were abandoned by both the @entity22 and @entity152 navies , hardly a strong selling point for resurrecting the @entity76 program			1
director / producer @entity155 told the @entity59 audience that he first sought financial backing from @entity66 about three years ago , which also explains one of the film 's dilemmas			0
it clearly was crafted initially to debunk concerns about @entity163 ( 1979 ) and @entity164 ( 1986 ) , but then the @entity166 nuclear disaster inconveniently intervened ( 2011 )			0
obviously unable to ignore @entity166 , @entity155 had one of the narrators visit the site to wield a radiation meter and contend that the reactor accidents should have been far less newsworthy than the earthquake - generated tsunami that caused them			0
still , the wrecked reactors are a nagging distraction from the film 's upbeat message , with one speaker acknowledging that " this is not just something you can brush away			0
this was not supposed to happen			0
" dismissing facts meanwhile , the movie contends that anti-nuclear activists have grossly overstated radiation risks , even as it overlooks scientific findings from , for example , the @entity190 on actual impacts of radiation releases			1
the film also dismisses energy efficiency in light of the allegedly inherent energy intensity of modern life , perpetuating the decade - old urban myth that a smartphone uses as much electricity as a refrigerator			0
( repeated demonstrations show that if you take everything into account , a smartphone and the cloud data it uses only represent 15 - 20 % as much electricity as an average refrigerator			0
) the film makes an effective case against coal combustion on public health grounds , with credible data on annual premature deaths both globally ( 3 million ) and in the @entity22 ( 13,000 )			0
yet this indictment promptly and unfairly broadens to cover the full universe of nuclear power skeptics : " to be anti-nuclear is to be in favor of burning fossil fuels , " and presumably all these deaths , too			2
in the final sequence , an ebullient @entity40 concludes : " this is the beginning of something really beautiful			0
" cut to that glowing globe of the @entity225 ( without a hint of irony , but remember that these are the same people who chose to include @entity229 in the title of a movie promoting nuclear power ; readers may recall that @entity229 was the figure in @entity236 mythology who unleashed evil spirits by opening a container that was supposed to be left undisturbed )			1
join us on @entity242 / @entity241 .			0

@entity44 : " @entity9 " a " love song to nuclear power "
@entity44 : film overlooks scientific statistics on radiation impacts
" star of the film " is the @entity76 , but the movie fails to mention *downsides*
