@entity0 -- @entity3 creaks open a metal door to let us into his cramped apartment			1
in a modest living room , he shows us a meticulously kept shrine to his wife			2
" my wife had always been a kind person since she was young			2
she was kind - hearted and gentle , " he says			2
the photos come from a different era in @entity13			1
one shows @entity3 and his wife , @entity16 , shoulder to shoulder and smiling at the camera			1
they made a handsome couple			2
both joined the @entity22 in the heady post-revolution years of the early 1950s			1
@entity3 was a historian at the @entity24			1
@entity16 became a respected educator at an elite @entity0 middle school			1
they dreamed of helping the party build a new @entity13			1
but just a few years later , @entity28 loyalty proved no protection for @entity16			1
as the madness of the @entity33 engulfed @entity0 , she became the first victim			0
" we trusted @entity28 , but no one ever thought it would become a party that murders people , " says @entity3			1
@entity39 , @entity40 's enforcers in one sense , the events that led up to @entity16 's death began with the bruised ego of @entity40			1
in the early 1960s , @entity13 's great revolutionary hero was still smarting from the catastrophic failure of the @entity47 , a policy of collective farming and industry that directly and indirectly caused the deaths of millions of @entity13			1
@entity40 called on a new revolution to stamp out what he called bourgeois and counter-revolutionary influences			1
conveniently , for @entity40 , the ensuing chaos helped shore up his personality cult and get rid of his political opponents			1
the early enforcers were the @entity39 , a proxy army of children and young adults that violently struck out at anyone not toeing the @entity63 line			1
intellectuals , educators as well as artifacts were all targeted			0
a favorite method was to whip their elders with the heavy metal buckles on their leather belts			0
but this was no random chaos			0
" there was absolutely a top down approach to the violence and there is plenty of evidence that everything was very carefully planned , " says historian @entity73 tter			0
" there were constant messages going from the party to the students			2
there was nothing spontaneous about it			0
" beatings , then an awful climax the trouble started in the early summer at @entity16 's school in @entity0			1
led by their leader @entity93 , the students labeled @entity16 as a counter-revolutionary and " opposing chairman @entity40 , " according to historian @entity95 , who attended the school at the time			1
soon the attacks got physical with @entity16 and other teachers put through so - called " struggle - sessions			1
" " students ran onto the stage to strike @entity16 with iron - clad wooden training rifles			1
each time @entity16 fell to the floor , someone would douse her with cold water and drag her upright again by the hair to endure further criticism , " says @entity3			1
@entity16 reached out to the party to stop the beatings but she got no reply			1
despite the obvious risks , @entity16 kept returning to the school			1
perhaps she felt there was nowhere to hide			0
on the afternoon of august 5 , 1966 , the beatings reached their awful climax			2
' we could n't stop the beatings ' the students of ' 66 are now in their 60s			1
i meet a group of them in a teahouse in @entity0			0
they have had careers and full lives but all seem haunted by the bloody events of that august			0
@entity133 was a student leader at the school when the @entity39 targeted @entity16			1
" i did n't know what to do , " she says , " i blame myself for not stopping it			0
" " we could n't stop the beating , because it would have been doing something against the trend			2
i respected ms. @entity143 , but i was too afraid to say anything , " says @entity142 , another former student			0
the mob beat @entity16 for three hours			1
they used the legs of their school desks spiked with nails			0
i could never forget this			0
she lay on the ground , her eyes were blurry , she was foaming at the mouth , " recalls @entity133			0
she says they carried @entity16 in a wheelbarrow to a hospital across the street from the school			1
@entity3 got the news about his wife in a phone call from the school			1
" they told me that she was injured and i should go			0
so i went with my four children , " says @entity3 , " i remember that hospital very clearly			1
" sensing the worst , @entity3 took a camera			2
he took pictures of his mortally wounded wife as evidence			0
the images are haunting and graphic			0
in one , his four children stand over their mother who lies on a gurney still clutching her handbag			0
" i laid a cloth over her face so my youngest would n't see			0
she had already passed , " says @entity3			2
no charges , no justice the authorities quickly cremated the body and no one has ever been charged despite , presumably , hundreds of witnesses			0
instead of condemning the murder , @entity40 seemed to embrace it			1
just days later , he held a mass rally for the @entity39 in @entity190 where @entity93 presented a @entity39 armband to the chairman			2
the official sanction of the violence was complete			0
" after @entity93 presented the armband to @entity40 , the number of murders increased massively , " says @entity95 , who has obsessively tracked the killings by interviewing hundreds of family members			2
" the @entity39 killed almost 2,000 people in the first two weeks alone			2
" she says they only stopped when the @entity0 municipal government eventually called them to halt in september			0
the @entity33 would drag on for a decade			0
in a society where educators and elders are traditionally revered , the brutal violence against teachers shocked many , but over the decades , the @entity22 has helped erase discussion of the stain on their history , and the violence is rarely discussed in public			1
but that may be changing			0
breaking the taboo over the past year , those closest to the events are tentatively trying to break the taboo			0
@entity93 , @entity133 and a handful of former classmates publicly apologized for the killing of @entity16			2
" i participated in the revolution voluntarily , no one forced me , " says @entity133 , " but after @entity16 's death my faith was turned			1
i had to question my beliefs			0
" all of the former students we interviewed said they were powerless to stop the killing			2
@entity93 declined to be interviewed			0
but their apologies have n't led to a widespread reckoning with the past			0
and few , if any , believe the @entity22 will tackle the issue			2
" there is hardly a person within the @entity33 whose hands are not dirty in some way			0
it is socially and politically explosive and that is why the apologies are not likely to go much further than they have already , " says @entity240 ter			0
for @entity3 , they are too little , too late			2
he says he still wants justice for his wife 's murder			1
" i ca n't accept them , the so - called apologies are hypocritical and not sincere			0
they just want to cover up their involvement , " he said , " they just want to slip away unpunished and turn this page over			0

decades later , former students apologize for failing to stop teacher 's murder
@entity39 beat @entity16 to death in 1966 for " opposing @entity40 "
*husband* @entity3 wants justice for his wife , whom he described as " gentle "
couple used to dream of helping @entity22 build a new @entity13
