@entity0 -- as military operations against @entity4 continue , there is a less visible , but no less important , diplomatic front , as the @entity5 seeks to recruit new international members and keep @entity9 nations committed and willing to help strike both within @entity11 and @entity12			1
@entity5 officials acknowledge this next , nonmilitary phase will be in some ways harder to implement , and even harder to measure			1
but they say the @entity9 support without hesitation to military action , traditionally a harder sell , gives them encouragement that the region is committed to putting its various rivalries aside to concentrate on the fight against @entity4			1
on tuesday , retired gen. @entity24 , the newly appointed envoy to the global coalition , and his deputy , @entity28 , head to the region , where they will press nations to stop the flow of foreign fighters across their borders to join @entity4 ' ranks and to stem financing , both considered the lifeblood of the military group			1
the ranks of the coalition have swelled since its formation began in earnest last month , although is unclear how many have signed on			2
speaking at the @entity46 last week , @entity5 president @entity45 claimed more than 40 nations , though a day earlier secretary of state @entity48 put the number at more than 50			1
now the @entity50 points to more than 60 coalition partners , including the @entity52 , the @entity46 and the @entity53			2
@entity48 : the fight against @entity4 is ' going to go on ' @entity45 : @entity5 misjudged @entity4 threat as of friday , the coalition had carried out more than 200 strikes in @entity11 and 43 in @entity12 , defense secretary @entity56 told reporters			1
the @entity5 had done the lion 's share of the bombing , although @entity9 states have contributed significantly			1
@entity63 , the @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 all participated in last week 's strikes in @entity12			0
@entity69 carried out an airstrike in @entity11 earlier this month			0
the @entity5 - led coalition fighting @entity4 in @entity11 grew by four on friday -- including @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
the @entity5 got a major boost when prime minster @entity76 of @entity73 won approval from @entity78 , after describing the militants as " psychopathic terrorists who want to kill us			1
" @entity73 lawmakers approved a limited deployment , but only in @entity11			2
@entity12 was n't even on the table , to avoid the same embarrassing defeat the @entity73 prime minister experienced last year when @entity78 rejected his call to join the @entity5 in strikes against @entity12 , casting doubt on @entity73 's reputation as @entity5 's closest ally during times of crisis			1
more than a military effort contributors to the effort go well beyond taking part in military operations			2
some nations are contributing planes , while others are sending ammunition and weapons to @entity11 and @entity104 forces and special forces to train the @entity11 army			2
still others are offering refueling assistance			0
@entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and the @entity116 all have made contributions to the military effort			2
but the bulk of the donations is directed toward the campaign against @entity4 in @entity11			0
as in @entity73 , public opinion in many @entity124 nations does not support an air campaign in @entity12 , out of fear of either starting a wider regional war or helping @entity12 president @entity128 cement his brutal grip on power			1
@entity5 officials say they are not bothered , and suggest the discrepancy is overblown			2
while support for strikes in @entity12 is symbolically important , they insist @entity5 military might , supported by @entity9 manpower , is more than sufficient			1
moreover , they add , the effort to dislodge @entity4 from @entity11 , for which they have considerable support from partners , is equally important			2
still , the administration does hold out hope that many of its coalition partners will follow @entity0 's own playbook -- starting with the effort in @entity11 , while building public support for wider involvement to include @entity12			2
@entity76 seemed to suggest as much by telling @entity78 there was more he wanted @entity73 to contribute to the coalition effort in time			1
@entity5 aims to cut @entity4 oil revenue the effort to cut off funding to terrorist groups is an area where cooperation is much less tangible			1
since 9/11 the @entity5 has urged its @entity159 allies to crack down on private financing to extremists in the region , with mixed results			2
and since the @entity12 conflict began more than three years ago , funding to various @entity12 opposition groups has often ended up in the hands of more extremist elements			0
in an interview with @entity1 's @entity170 , @entity48 said the threat @entity4 poses to the region has been a wake - up call for nations to get serious about stopping the funding , including to @entity12 groups			0
" state - sponsored support of these groups , i believe , is over -- is ended			0
there are still individuals within certain countries who have been funneling money to these groups			0
the theory back in the beginning by many of these people were , well , we 're going to get rid of @entity128 and then we 'll focus on these bad apples , " @entity48 said			0
" they realized it morphed into something more ominous , more threatening , and so i think people have really pulled back			0
" today , @entity4 is not just one of the most dangerous organizations , it is also one of the richest			0
beyond private donations , the group has emerged as a ruthless terror corporation , earning millions of dollars every day from black market sales of oil in areas it controls			0
oil is smuggled out of @entity12 by @entity4 tankers , driven along secret routes in @entity207 's southern corridor and sold by middlemen and local tribes			0
airstrikes against some of the organization 's refineries have sought to limit @entity4 ' own use of the crude , but an important new phase of the @entity5 coalition effort is focused on getting neighboring countries to clamp down on black markets and networks handling the sale of oil , which is fueling its reign of terror			1
looking for new coalition partners @entity207 is central to all these efforts			0
@entity226 committed last week to joining the @entity228 coalition , but it has provided no details on what it will do			1
@entity207 stayed on the sidelines while @entity4 held 49 @entity207 hostages , but those hostages were freed september 20			0
@entity5 officials say they expect @entity207 to play a major role going forward in many aspects of the campaign , but its role remains far from clear			2
@entity240 , too , has been vague about what role it could play			0
last week , @entity243 said it would join in the fight against @entity4 , but did not mention the coalition and has opposed the strikes in @entity12 , saying the @entity5 should have sought permission from @entity128			1
one often overlooked , but critical , aspect of the fight against @entity4 is the communications battle			0
the @entity5 is looking for @entity9 states to undertake a major effort to , in the @entity48 's words , " reclaim @entity251 by @entity252 , by those to whom it belongs			1
" the @entity5 is urging countries like @entity63 and @entity258 to get their clerics to speak out against the group and @entity9 networks like @entity263 and @entity264 to counter @entity4 ' sophisticated media machine			1
the success or failure of that communications effort could ultimately have repercussions for the resolve of a coalition that depends so heavily on buy - in from @entity9 states			1
" i 'm absolutely convinced the coalition is on board			0
there 's no question about it			0
and they proved that in the air , in their willingness to join -- historically , to many people 's amazement , they all came together , " @entity48 told @entity170			0
" there 's a sense of purpose now in this focus			0

top @entity5 generals and diplomats are headed for @entity9 countries
the @entity228 coalition depends on cooperation from @entity9 nations
the @entity73 and other @entity299 nations joined the @entity228 coalition friday
the @entity301 says more than 50 countries are contributing to effort
