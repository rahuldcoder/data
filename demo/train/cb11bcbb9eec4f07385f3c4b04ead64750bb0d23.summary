-- @entity1 will take a three - shot lead heading into the final two rounds of the masters at @entity5 after firing a four - under par 68 on friday			1
an incredible run of five straight birdies on @entity5 's famously difficult back nine helped put the 2012 champion in pole position heading into the weekend			1
@entity1 's initial progress was unremarkable as he reached the turn in even par -- a birdie at the par - four seventh was canceled out two holes later with bogey at nine			2
but his challenge burst into life at the par - three 12th when he fired his tee shot to two - and - a - half feet to leave a simple tap in for birdie			2
another followed at the 13th hole before an astonishing putt at the 14th made it three in a row			0
two further birdies saw @entity1 reach eight - under before his hot streak ended with a par at the 17th followed by a bogey at the last			2
together with his opening round 69 , @entity1 is now seven - under par and in control of the tournament			1
" it 's never easy , " @entity1 said			0
" it 's a great test of golf and i just got some good breaks , some good things that went my way			0
guessed the wind right on the stretch of holes on the back nine there			0
" @entity1 's string of birdies bettered a run of four he made in the final round when he won two years ago			0
full leaderboard : @entity51 " that five hole stretch was good			0
it 's one of those where you 're not focused on what you 're doing , you do n't know that you 're making all these birdies , you 're focused on one shot at a time , " he said			0
@entity1 was one of the early finishers on day two and no one came close to challenging him as the afternoon wore on			0
overnight leader @entity63 stuttered to the turn in one over , before watching the wheels come off his round at @entity5 completing the three - hole stretch of 11 , 12 and 13 in four - over par. the 31 - year - old ended the day with a 78 to fall back to two over par. he was n't the only one to struggle as the wind picked up and the greens dried out			1
defending champion @entity73 toiled on the opening nine dropping three shots before mounting a recovery with birdies at the 12th , 13th and 15th to finish at three under after 36 holes			1
" it was so difficult early on , the greens were very dried out and it was hard to make some putts -- it was hard to hit them confidently , " @entity73 said			2
" i did n't really play well at the start but then made the turn -- you can make it happen if you get through the first couple of holes on the back nine			0
" the @entity91 finds himself in a four - way tie for third alongside @entity95 ( 68 ) and @entity98 's rookies @entity96 from @entity99 who posted a 71 on friday and 20 - year - old @entity100 from the @entity101 who shot a round of 70			2
@entity1 's nearest chaser is another @entity91 , @entity105 , who finished on four - under par after shooting 68 on friday			2
@entity107 , the 1992 champion , is also in the mix after a second consecutive round of 71 left him two - under par and in a tie for seventh with compatriots @entity112 and @entity114			1
@entity101 's @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 are joined at one - under par by @entity120 @entity119 and scot @entity121			0
further down the leaderboard , it was a good day for three ex-champions from the 1980s			0
the 1985 winner @entity127 and @entity128 , whose sensational chip - in at the second play - off hole won the 1987 masters , both finished comfortably inside the cut at two - over par. scot @entity134 , who triumphed in 1988 , also squeezed in at four - over par -- the same score as @entity138 's @entity137 who limped to a 77			1
plenty of big names , however , will not be coming back at the weekend including three - time champion @entity141 who ended five - over on friday following a round of 73			1
@entity143 also missed the cut by one stroke as did @entity147 's @entity146 , @entity149 's 2011 champion @entity148 and 19 - year - old @entity151 amateur @entity150			1
