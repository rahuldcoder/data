@entity1 passengers taking the @entity2 to @entity4 red - eye got a helpful boost from stronger - than - average winds , reaching near - supersonic speeds and cutting 90 minutes off the scheduled flight time			1
the @entity11 @entity10 made the @entity14 - @entity13 route in five hours , 16 minutes last wednesday , and reached ground speeds of up to 1200 km / h ( 745 mph ) , riding a powerful jet stream of up to 322 km / h ( 200 mph ) tailwinds			1
the sonic barrier is broken at 1224 km / h ( 761 mph )			2
' like surfing ' former @entity11 pilot @entity19 told the @entity21 press that riding the jet stream was " just like surfing			2
" " it 's extraordinary how fast you can go , " the @entity23 quoted him as saying			0
" you try to sit in the core of the jet where it 's not too turbulent and where you can pick up some free mileage			0
it 's not unusual to get 100 mph tailwinds but ( these pilots ) have got more than that			0
this must be a record			0
" several other flights heading east over the @entity38 also benefited from the weather , but it was flight @entity41 that made headlines with the record time			1
what is turbulence ? matching @entity47 ? not even close only the now - retired @entity47 , which was operated by @entity11 and @entity48 until it was decommissioned in 2003 , bested @entity50 's @entity14 - @entity13 time -- a @entity47 made that trip in 1996 in just under two hours , 53 minutes			1
for @entity54 passengers traveling westwards , however , the jet stream will mean longer - than - average flight times as planes need to battle powerful headwinds			1
gale - force winds affected travel in the @entity21 this week ahead of forecasted heavy snow			0
some 40,000 households in @entity62 were without power as the power grid went down in the @entity65 .			0

a @entity11 flight makes @entity14 - @entity13 in record time
plane *hitches* a ride on powerful *jetstream* , reducing flight time by an hour and a half
*boeing* *777* - 200 hits speeds of 745 mph , just *shy* of the speed of sound
