-- if you take @entity5 ' word for it , @entity2 's new @entity1 is " the best tablet at any price			1
and it 's an obvious reaction to the reviews of last year 's first - generation @entity1 , which praised the $ 199 price but made it clear you 're getting the substandard tablet experience you just paid next to nothing for			1
this year , @entity2 has a new @entity1 called the @entity1 that 's a noticeable improvement over the original			1
but is it the " best tablet at any price " ? nope			0
if you read the reviews , including mine , you 'll quickly learn @entity5 seems to have adopted the " reality distortion field " that @entity21 was famous for			0
does that mean the @entity1 is horrible ? no. not at all			0
in fact , it 's still a decent option if you do n't want to shell out $ 500 or more on an @entity26			1
but how is @entity2 able to make a good tablet at such a cheap price ? simple			2
like @entity2 , the @entity1 is built to find ways to sell you more stuff			2
first , and most annoyingly of all , the @entity1 displays full - color ads on its lock screen			2
that means every time you switch the device on , you see an ad for stuff like a @entity1 e-book , a movie download , music from @entity2 's mp3 store and the like			1
@entity2 told me you 'll also see a lot of third - party ads for products outside @entity2 's ecosystem			1
the good news is , if the ads really bother you , you can pay $ 15 to @entity2 after you purchase the device to remove them for good			2
but @entity2 did n't stop with the ads. when you 're using the tablet , you 're constantly inundated with suggestions to check out more @entity2 products			1
the most blatant example of this is on the @entity1 's home screen			1
whenever you hover over an app , movie , song or book , there 's a section at the bottom of the screen that suggests other apps , movies , songs or books that you might want to buy			0
do you like playing @entity76 ? buy cut the rope ! do you like listening to @entity78 ? check out @entity80 's latest album ! you get the idea			0
it 's nearly identical to the way @entity2 's website suggests items to you when you 're shopping around			2
these ads and suggested items are a clever way for @entity2 to continue to drive value out of you months and months after you buy the @entity1			1
and it 's completely antithetical to your typical tablet experience			0
tablets are supposed to be computing devices , helping you browse the @entity94 , check e-mail , manage your calendar and the like			0
yes , they make it easy to buy new content , but on devices like the @entity26 and @entity103 's @entity102 , you 're not constantly pushed to do so			1
but @entity2 does n't see it that way			0
it 's just another portal to get you to buy			0
when you buy a @entity1 , it does n't feel like your tablet			2
it feels like @entity2 's			0
is this a dealbreaker ? no way			0
in fact , i imagine there are plenty of people out there who wo n't mind looking at ads and suggestions for stuff to buy if it means getting a decent tablet for less than $ 200			1
but if i had a choice between a $ 199 tablet with ads and offers ( like the @entity1 ) and a $ 199 without ads and offers ( like the @entity102 ) , i 'd go with the latter every time			1

@entity1 is n't really " best tablet at any price " but still decent option for the price
@entity2 offsets lower price by using the tablet to spur more *sales*
ads and suggestions are frequent when using the @entity1
it 's not a deal - breaker but could open the door for @entity103 's @entity102
