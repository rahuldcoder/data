@entity10 great @entity9 , a veteran 63 caps for the @entity10 in the 15 - a - side form of the game , will act as an ambassador for next month 's @entity16 event in @entity17			1
the giant winger became a worldwide star after an electrifying series of performances on the wing for the @entity10 at the 1995 @entity23 , but the second half of his career was blighted by serious kidney problems that required a transplant in 2004			1
" he is a legend in the game of fifteens , and more importantly , he 's a legend in the game of sevens , " @entity29 general manager @entity28 said in a statement			2
" he 's also a legend in @entity17 , so to be able to bring all of those things together and have him be a part of the tournament is incredibly special			0
" " with the sport of sevens set to make an appearance at the 2016 @entity8 , we also look at this as an opportunity for @entity9 to be an advocate for the next generation of sevens athletes			1

he was scheduled to take part in a charity boxing event in 2011 , but had to withdraw due to his continued kidney problems			0
@entity17 is of special significance to @entity9 after he spent three years playing for the regional @entity77 team in the southern hemisphere 's @entity79 competition , while also representing the city in provincial competition			1
despite his many triumphs , sevens success in @entity17 evaded @entity9			1
