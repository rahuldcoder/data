it 's one of the most eagerly awaited days of the football calendar with one former legend calling it for be made a public holiday -- but why is this year 's transfer deadline day turning into a damp squib ? transfer deadline day marks the end of the period in which clubs are allowed to sign players -- meaning that once the window ' slams shut ' at 11pm gmt , no further business can be done			1
there are two windows in each year -- one beginning on july 1 and ending on august 31 and the other starting on january 1 and finishing on the final day of the month unless that day falls on the weekend as it does on this occasion			0
while most of the business is done during the month long period , the frenetic nature of deadline day means some clubs are left waiting until the final minutes to get their deals done -- leading to masses of excitement , cynicism and often disappointment from fans across social media			1
supporters stay up late in front of the television awaiting the very latest news from their respective clubs with hopes for a last minute superstar signing becoming increasingly desperate			2
but this year 's deadline day has been one of the quietest in recent years			1
last season 's january transfer window was noticeable for several big deals including @entity47 's $ 56million move from @entity48 to @entity49			1
@entity48 spent $ 32million on midfielder @entity50 on top of bringing in @entity52 and @entity53			0
but heading into the final day of the transfer window period , the gross spending of the 20 @entity56 clubs stood at £ 80m ( $ 120m )			1
@entity59 's signing of @entity60 from @entity61 for a fee reported to be in the region of $ 38 million is the biggest of the transfer window in @entity65 so far			1
@entity66 spent around $ 17m on @entity67 , the @entity68 defender from @entity69 , while @entity70 coughed up $ 13.5m for @entity71 forward @entity72			0
" while the summer window saw a record level of transfer spending , so far we have seen spending in january being slightly more reserved , " said @entity73 , partner in the @entity74 at @entity75			2
" however , 2014/15 is still a record season for @entity56 spending , with clubs having spent over £ 900m , significantly ahead of the previous record of £ 760m			2
" this level of spending has been made possible in large part through the broadcast revenue @entity56 clubs enjoy			1
with all 20 @entity56 clubs now ranked in the top 40 globally by revenue , we continue to see them use their increased resources to invest in playing talent in the january window			1
" in @entity65 , the clubs facing relegation from the world 's richest league have been reluctant to throw money at the problem in a bid to ensure survival			0
there have been a number of loan deals completed but actual transfers are in scarce supply			0
" i think the surprising thing is that it 's quiet at the lower end of the table , " @entity105 , former @entity106 chief executive and @entity108 football scout , told @entity1			0
" it 's so tight down there and it 's the last opportunity to do something which can make a great difference			0
there 's a lot of money and prestige at stake			0
" for the top clubs it 's trickier because you do n't want to buy players who ca n't play in @entity125			2
" for @entity126 , i do n't think players currently playing in the @entity125 would come and play for them at the moment			0
" the window will also close hours before february 3 in @entity131 , @entity132 and the @entity133			2
in @entity135 , where the window closed on friday , clubs spent $ 79.5 million during the transfer window up from $ 53.7 million at the same time last year			1
@entity139 's signing of @entity68 midfielder @entity140 from @entity141 for a fee believed to be in the region of $ 14.5 million and @entity108 wonderkid @entity144 took the headlines .			0
