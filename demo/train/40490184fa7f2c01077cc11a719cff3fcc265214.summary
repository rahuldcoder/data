-- beset by war and sectarian violence , @entity1 has not had a lot to laugh about in recent years			2
but a trio of old friends from @entity7 have sought to change that , by distilling the jokey banter of their late - night drinking sessions into a controversial talk show			1
hosted by @entity14 and @entity15 , and produced by their friend @entity16 , the show is called " @entity17 " -- " there is this guy " -- the typical setup for one of their anecdotes			1
the aim behind the production , says @entity16 , " was to make people smile			2
" " we wanted to do anything to make miserable and sad people happy , " he said			2
but while it 's proved a hit with their predominantly male audience , not everyone appreciates their sense of humor			1
@entity14 describes the first episode , broadcast in the summer of 2011 , as " very bold			0
" " it got us into a lot of trouble because there was sexual and pornographic innuendos , so it was like a shock for all @entity1 , " he laughs			1
since then , the show has routinely offended the conservative sectors of @entity1 society with its discussion of taboo topics including relationships and sex			1
a religious group staged a demonstration outside the show 's studio last year , and government censors complained about the content			1

" i ca n't tell you ( who ) because this means i will give them another chance to come to me again , " he laughs			0
the jokes might not be considered particularly edgy to @entity70 -- or even necessarily that funny			0
a typical gag goes like this : " a stoned guy bought two birds for his mother , one tweeting and the other silent			0
she asks , ' son , why is it that only one of them that is tweeting ? ' ' mother , the other one is the composer , ' he replied			0
" but although the humor may seem mild , @entity1 is not yet ready for " @entity87			1
" @entity14 says the team has had to modify their approach in order to continue broadcasting			0
" we changed things in the show , " he said			1
" we used to have a female @entity95 , but we were asked to remove her from the show , and we did			2
" even in the new @entity1 , said @entity96 , there are still many " red lines " that can not be crossed in entertainment			0
" were it not for the limitations that are imposed on us , it would be a much better show			2
but we have to live with social taboos , " he said			0
challenging this , he says , is " impossible , " at least for now			0
but as frustrating as it might be , he and his friends are content to tone down their act , if it means bringing a smile to people 's faces .			1
