-- he was just 4 years old when his treatment sparked international outrage			2
about a year later , he won an award for the world 's youngest sailor			2
and he piloted a plane before he turned 6			1
up next ? crossing the @entity8 by unicycle			2
welcome to the unorthodox and controversial world of @entity11 and his " @entity12			1
" the world first met little @entity11 , as he 's nicknamed , in 2012			1
a video surfaced of his small 4 - year - old frame shivering in subfreezing temperatures			2
" @entity17 , daddy please hold me ! " @entity19 cried into the camera			0
his tiny body was shielded from the cold and snowy @entity22 winter only by bright yellow underwear and a pair of white sneakers			1
his family was in @entity22 on vacation , but there 's no time off from training when you 're the son of @entity31			0
that video drew criticism and some praise from around the world			0
but he did n't mind			0
he says he knew what he was doing			0
" i 've always felt @entity39 parents spoil their only child too much , " he told @entity0 at the time			1
" we do n't expose them to nature enough , and they get weaker and less competitive compared to foreign children			0
" @entity31 , who dubbed himself @entity12 , did n't just want his son to succeed , he wanted him to soar			0
" like an eagle , i push my child to the limit so he can learn how to fly			1
" two years later , the duo have made good on that pledge			1
at their high - end apartment in @entity55 , certificates from @entity39 authorities line the walls , and there are world records : there 's one for the youngest person to start an investment company and one for the youngest pilot			1
the latter acknowledges @entity11 's 30 - minute flight near @entity65 at an altitude of 1,000 feet			1
also posted on the wall : spreadsheets and documents that detail @entity11 's daily schedule			1
the precocious 6 - year - old rises at 7 a.m. , but only on his holiday			1
normally , he wakes up at 6:30			0
but even the world 's youngest pilot gets a day to rest			0
" on sunday , i can even watch movies			0
the energetic child , who happily speaks his mind and tears around the apartment , stands in sharp contrast to the child the world first saw crying and upset in the snow			2
looking back on that day in @entity22 , @entity11 remembers the cold , but he also remembers what came next			1
" when i was running nearly naked , i kept crying			0
and then dad gave me a hot bath			2
" for his part , he says there 's more to their story than the extreme images			0
yes , he made his son run in the snow , and he also took him skiing and made him take cold baths			1
but there were less dramatic scenes , too			0
the family focuses on education , @entity31 insists , and the tough stuff has a purpose			0
" if a child does not go through hardship , then he can not become strong , " he explains			1
" that means when they are small , you should let your child struggle more , allow them to experience more , and it is good for their development			2
" their life is n't all struggle , though			0
@entity11 lives comfortably and hopes to grow up to become an entrepreneur like @entity120 " because you can help other people and you can buy a lot of things			1
" and what does the boy himself think of his @entity12 's methods ? " the good side is that i can learn a lot			2
the bad side is that he 's just too strict ! "			0

@entity11 piloted a plane and started an investment company by age 6
his dad also made him stand outside in freezing cold wearing just underwear and shoes
" like an eagle , i push my child to the limit so he can learn how to fly , " his father said
" if a child does not go through hardship , then he can not become strong "
