@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 replaced two high - level government ministers monday -- citing errors and incompetence -- in the latest round of replacements at top - level government posts			1
sugar minister @entity10 was fired after requesting his release because of admitted shortcomings in his own performance , according to an official statement published tuesday in the country 's state - run newspaper			1
@entity18 will replace him , it said			0
transportation minister @entity20 was fired due to " errors in the performance of duties , " state media reported			1
he also lost his post as a vice president on a top governing body called the @entity28 , it said			0
transport director @entity29 replaced @entity30 at the @entity31 , while gen. @entity32 -- a long - time commander in the @entity1 army -- assumed @entity30 's post on the @entity28			1
president @entity3 , once the world 's longest serving defense minister , assumed the presidency in 2006 when his older brother , @entity39 , stepped down because of illness -- at first temporarily , and then permanently in 2008			1
since then , many analysts have speculated that the younger @entity3 has worked to consolidate power , replacing top government posts with army brass			0
" the @entity49 is now substantially different to what it was in 2006 , and substantially different to what it was in 2008 , " when @entity39 officially ceded power , said @entity46 , senior fellow at @entity47 and recent author of " @entity1 : what everyone needs to @entity53			0
" " of course this is @entity3 solidifying control , " she said , " but it 's also an attempt to impose a culture of governance and efficiency " in leadership positions that " under @entity39 were very uneven			1
" @entity46 and others contend that recent changes in leadership may be part of broader economic measures intended to streamline @entity1 's bloated state sector , which @entity3 recently said has supported an excess of up to a million workers			2
@entity71 's release from @entity1 's @entity72 also has raised questions about its broader future			1
once a world leader in sugar exportation , @entity1 has faced a steady decline since the collapse of the @entity79 and the accompanying subsidies that once boosted sugar production on the island nation			2
widespread speculation suggests the country may eventually close its @entity72 or even open it up to foreign investment in an effort to boost @entity1 's cash - strapped economy			2
" if that pans out , they may be bringing in someone [ at the @entity72 ] who is more suited to that task , " said @entity1 analyst @entity88 from the @entity89 in @entity90			0
" it may be aimed at foreign investment , " he said , adding that " @entity96 and others could really help turn that sector into an energy producer			0
" later tuesday morning , tourism minister @entity101 announced plans to open up real estate to foreign investment on tourism - related projects , laying out plans for new hotels across the country			2
the move comes only weeks after @entity1 instituted a pilot program of turning over hundreds of state - run barber shops and beauty salons to employees			0
since taking office , @entity3 has allowed such small liberalization measures and tackled corruption , fostering the creation of a comptroller general 's office intended to better manage state revenues			0
monday 's replacements come on the heels of the removal of @entity124 , long - time head of the country 's airlines and airport			1
while no official explanation was given for @entity124 's release , it prompted widespread speculation of corruption			1
in an uncharacteristically critical article published on a state - sanctioned website last month , @entity1 columnist @entity133 called corruption a greater threat to the island nation than internal dissent , specifically noting @entity124 's dismissal			0
" corruption is the real counterrevolution , " @entity141 wrote , cautioning against groups entrenched in the country 's @entity144 system .			0
