" @entity64 , a leader of @entity35 , described the negotiations as both difficult and serious			0
he accused @entity10 of " playing semantic games			0
" " since we are determined ( to work things out ) , we agreed to extend the humanitarian truce in order to hold more in - depth consultations -- and to allow more pressure on the @entity10 , internally and externally , so they agree with our demands , " the @entity35 leader said			1
the two sides ' demands are n't easy to reconcile			0
@entity10 says it wants @entity35 to disarm and @entity1 to be demilitarized			2
