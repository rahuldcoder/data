previously unknown paintings by @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 are among a treasure trove of art -- much of it believed to have been looted by the @entity7 -- found hidden in a @entity9 apartment			1
the vast collection , which experts say has " a value so high it can not be estimated , " was recovered in a raid by @entity14 tax authorities , in connection with an investigation into tax evasion , in february and march 2012			1
at a press conference in @entity14 on tuesday , experts revealed that more than 1,300 artworks -- many long feared lost or destroyed , and some which had never been recorded -- had been discovered			1
among the haul were paintings by @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
" a total of 121 framed and 1,285 unframed works , among them works by famous artists , were seized , " prosecutor @entity33 announced			2
" there were oil paintings , works in india ink , pencil , watercolors , lithographs and prints			2
" @entity33 said there were " concrete indications that [ some of it ] is so - called ' degenerate art ' or stolen art. " art looted by @entity7 ' found in @entity14 apartment ' ' degenerate art ' thousands of pieces of art condemned as " degenerate " by the @entity7 were confiscated from galleries and private collectors in the 1930s and 1940s			1
other works were stolen from @entity61 families or sold for a fraction of their true value as the owners tried to flee the country			0
" the @entity14 government is supporting the state prosecution in @entity70 by supplying advice from experts in the field of so - called degenerate art and the entire issue of @entity77 - looted art , " government spokesman @entity67 said			1
" but we can not comment any of the issues of the ongoing investigation			0
" the collection 's existence only came to light this past weekend , with an article in the @entity14 news magazine focus , which reported that that the pictures were found when customs police raided the rundown apartment in the @entity89 district of @entity9 last year			1
the recovered paintings are said to have been kept in storage in a secure warehouse in the city ever since			2
the @entity9 apartment where the artworks were found belongs to @entity96 , 80			1
@entity96 's father @entity97 was an art collector who dealt in works for the @entity7 , according to art historians			1
@entity100 had claimed the works were destroyed in @entity103 firebombing near the end of the @entity105			0
it is not clear how his son came to be in possession of the paintings			0
the authorities say @entity96 was unknown to them			2
he was not on any of the tax rolls and not even known by social security			0
no charges have been filed against @entity96 , he is not under arrest , and the prosecutor said it is not clear which laws if any had been violated			0
art historian @entity119 , who has been cataloging the collection , said it contained important pieces of the highest quality -- some of which were completely unknown			2
art labeled ' degenerate ' back on display in @entity14 legal claims " to stand in front of these works , which have for a long time been thought missing , lost or destroyed and to see them in a relatively good condition -- in part a little dirty , but not damaged -- gives one a somewhat eerie feeling of happiness			1
" many of the works were not known at all , previously , so they will have a big impact on research into the artists concerned , once the investigation is complete and they can be revealed publicly			0
" the relatives of many @entity61 families whose art collections were plundered during the @entity77 era are now expected to launch legal action to try to reclaim their property			0
" we demand that the paintings be handed back to their original owners , " said @entity150 , representative of the @entity151			0
speaking to @entity156 before the full extent of the discovery became clear , @entity154 , chairman of the @entity155 , said it was " very encouraging ... but there are tens of thousands of artworks still under dispute , so this is really just a drop in the ocean			0
