two @entity1 military aircraft flew into @entity4 's newly claimed and challenged air defense zone over the @entity5 , a @entity1 official said , an action that could inflame tensions between the world powers			1
the @entity10 b - 52 planes -- which were not armed because they were on a training mission -- set off monday from @entity12 and returned there without incident			0
the mission lasted for several hours , and the aircraft were in @entity4 's newly declared air zone for about an hour , according to the @entity1 official			1
the planes ' pilots did not identify themselves upon entering the disputed airspace , as @entity4 would have wanted , according to the official			2
the official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation			0
the flights came two days after @entity4 unilaterally announced the creation of a " @entity25 " over several islands it and @entity29 have both claimed			2
the two countries have been sharply at odds over those isles , which are believed to be near large reserves of natural resources			0
@entity35 responded negatively to what secretary of state @entity36 characterized as an " escalatory action ( that ) will only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident			0
" the @entity1 government has rallied around its ally @entity29 , where thousands of its troops are stationed as part of a security treaty			2
and specifically regarding @entity4 's new air defense zone , the @entity1 has said it wo n't recognize it -- nor @entity4 's call that aircraft entering it identify themselves and file flight plans			1
@entity55 , though , has dismissed the @entity1 position as unjustified and urged @entity35 to butt out of the territorial dispute			2
@entity4 defense ministry spokesman col. @entity58 on sunday called such criticism " completely unreasonable , " " irresponsible " and " inappropriate , " telling the @entity1 to stop taking sides and not send more " wrong signals " that could lead to a " risky move by @entity29			1
" and @entity4 's foreign ministry lodged a formal complaint with @entity1 ambassador @entity66 asking @entity35 " to correct its mistakes immediately			1
" on tuesday , @entity4 's @entity69 ambassador @entity68 sidestepped a question about @entity1 warplanes violating his nation 's new air defense zone			1
at the same time , he defended the zone 's creation , calling it a " normal arrangement " that " does n't really change anything			2
" " it 's natural , it 's indeed the right of every country to defend its airspace and also to make sure that its territorial integrity , its sovereignty are safeguarded , " @entity68 said at the @entity69			0
@entity29 's two main commercial airlines said wednesday that following a request from the @entity29 government , they and other members of the @entity87 of @entity29 will not submit flight plans to @entity4 authorities for flights through the zone claimed by @entity55			1
the two carriers , @entity94 and @entity95 , said the association had concluded that there would be " no impact " on the safety of passengers on board flights through the zone without the submission of flight plans to @entity4			1
long - running dispute over islands the disagreement centers around what 's known as the @entity108 by @entity29 and the @entity108 by @entity4 , which are close to strategically important shipping lanes and surrounded by waters full of rich marine life			1
@entity4 says its claim to these islands extends back hundreds of years			0
@entity29 , on the other hand , says it saw no trace of @entity4 control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as @entity29 sovereign territory in 1895			0
@entity29 then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers			0
the dispute intensified in the second half of 2012			0
why @entity4 's new air zone incensed @entity29 , @entity1 protests erupted in @entity4 after @entity29 announced it had bought several of the disputed islands from private @entity29 owners			1
the deal was struck in part to prevent the islands from being bought by the controversial @entity134 governor , @entity133 , who had called for donations for a public fund to buy them			0
this sale outraged @entity4 's government , and groups of its citizens protested violently in several @entity4 cities , calling for boycotts of @entity29 products and urging the government to give the islands back			1
in december 2012 , the dispute escalated further when @entity29 scrambled fighter jets after a @entity4 plane was seen near the islands			0
that situation has recurred repeatedly since , and @entity4 's latest announcement makes it likely it will keep happening			2
at sea , @entity4 ships have frequently entered contested waters despite warnings from the @entity157			0
@entity4 slams ' inappropriate ' @entity1 remarks on territorial dispute how does the new air defense zone factor into these disputes ? some in @entity29 , for one , have viewed the @entity4 move as provocative , as does the @entity1			1
" this ... appears to be an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the @entity5 , and thus will raise regional tensions and increase the risk of miscalculation , confrontation and accidents , " @entity164 spokeswoman @entity163 said tuesday			1
a story in @entity4 's state - run @entity175 news agency plays down its significance , with naval expert @entity177 insisting " other nations do not need to be alarmed			1
" he noted that @entity29 , @entity179 , the @entity180 and @entity181 all have their own air defense zones			1
given these nations ' close proximity to each other , it 's inevitable some such zones will overlap , another expert , @entity189 , said in the same report			0
@entity163 said @entity35 is bothered by @entity4 -- or , for that matter , any country -- asking foreign planes entering what it calls its airspace to identify themselves			2
" the @entity1 does not apply that procedure to foreign aircraft , " she added , " so it certainly is one we do n't think others should apply			0
" @entity4 aircraft carrier group on the move @entity4 's military , meanwhile , announced on its website early wednesday that its navy 's sole aircraft carrier was heading toward the @entity207			1
that 's where @entity4 has had territorial disputes with other @entity212 nations including the @entity180 and @entity181			0
at the same time , the @entity5 -- where it recently declared an " air defense zone " causing a stir with @entity29 and its ally the @entity1 -- is not far away			1
the carrier , named @entity218 , set out from a shipyard in eastern @entity4 's @entity220 on tuesday morning , the military said on its website			2
@entity4 's state - run @entity221 also reported the news , showing the carrier -- which was commissioned in september 2012 and first had aircraft leaving and landing on it two months later , according to the @entity225 -- heading out to sea			1
as with @entity1 aircraft carriers , it does n't travel alone : two guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates are accompanying the massive ship as part of its group			0
why ? the @entity4 military makes no mention of the dispute with @entity29 and its ally , the @entity1			2
rather , its website post notes that the carrier group 's mission is to conduct scientific experiments and military training			0
that said , it is noteworthy that -- in order to get from @entity220 to the @entity207 -- the aircraft carrier group has to first go through the @entity5 .			0

@entity29 airlines say they will not submit flight plans to @entity4 for the zone
@entity4 ambassador : it 's " the right of every country to defend its airspace "
@entity1 calls the move an apparent try " to unilaterally change the status quo "
@entity1 official : b - *52s* do n't tell @entity55 about flight over @entity4 's new air defense zone
