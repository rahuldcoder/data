-- in the wake of the @entity1 horror in @entity5 , your local mall wants you to know it is doing everything possible to protect you			0
that 's bunk -- at least if you listen to one very knowledgeable former beat cop			0
malls boast of spending millions on security , but that security largely protects merchandise , not people , says @entity15 , a retired @entity16 , @entity17 , police officer			1
shopping malls can do a better job of protecting shoppers from shooters , and it does n't take metal detectors , full - body searches , bomb dogs , legions of security officers or a lot of money , he says -- it just takes the will			1
questions linger after @entity5 mall attack @entity15 helped implement a security plan at @entity16 's @entity34 , one of the nation 's largest shopping malls			1
the framework for the plan grew out of a disaster averted nearly a decade ago			0
in 2004 , @entity15 , then a patrol officer on the town 's east side , said he was sent to investigate a man who was giving polished stones and coins to children on a school playground			1
when @entity15 located the man a block away , he found the man 's van stocked with rifles and " bags of ammunition			1
" the man said he had been " sent to @entity57 by @entity58 , " @entity15 said			1
no one was harmed , but that was n't because of a quick , coordinated response by school and police officials			0
in fact , the response was a " calamity of errors , " @entity15 recalls			2
angry , @entity15 confronted the school principal , faulting her for not responding adequately to the threat			2
the principal , flummoxed , asked @entity15 what she should have done , @entity15 said			2
and that 's when it struck @entity15 : he had no idea			2
" as a policeman , you 're used to having all the answers ... and i did n't have an answer , " @entity15 said			1
@entity5 - style mall attack : can it happen here ? @entity15 set out on " a quest			1
" he started looking for effective ways to respond to dangerous situations , including " active shooter " situations			0
@entity15 learned that at the time , @entity17 law required schools to have nine fire drills a year , even though no student had been killed in a school fire for some 40 years			1
but there was no comparable drill to protect students from deranged gunmen , dangerous non-custodial parents , terrorists , or other modern - day threats			0
so @entity15 became an advocate of " lock - down " drills -- drills in which students and teachers barricade themselves from threats , a tactic that could protect them for the eight minutes it takes , on average , for police to respond			1
lock - down drills became @entity15 's obsession			1
building on the work of others , he pushed for all schools to have lock - down drills			2
in 2006 , @entity17 became the first state to require lock - down drills in all schools			2
the legislature mandated five lock - down drills and five fire drills a year			0
then , in 2007 and 2008 , a spate of shootings struck @entity124 shopping malls			0
" and i started to go , ' wait a minute			0
what 's working in our schools can work in our shopping malls too , " @entity15 said			1
man accused of threatening to shoot up @entity132 mall with his department 's encouragement , @entity15 said he approached the @entity34 's management with the idea of lock - down drills			1
so now , twice a month -- once in the morning and once in the evening , assuring that both work shifts become acquainted with the drills -- the mall 's security department asks patrons to seek shelter in the nearest mall store			1
an alarm buzzes , and a " lock - down " message is delivered electronically to every store			0
the store gates are lowered , lights are turned off , and shoppers huddle in a safe spot , typically the back room			0
the drills last only a few minutes			0
" the whole goal of a lockdown is to minimize potential victims while maximizing the time in which the police can get there to solve your problem , " @entity15 said			1
this exercise costs virtually nothing			0
any shopping mall , office building , or establishment with a public address system can conduct one			0
it does not infringe on anyone 's constitutional rights			0
participation is voluntary ; any shopper who does not want to participate can simply walk away			0
the @entity34 thinks the program is of such value that it mandates participation in store leases , @entity15 said			1
" when a new store manager says , do i have to do this , the answer is yes , " @entity15 said			2
" it takes time and commitment and the willingness to work through it and see it to fruition , " he added			0
" and you also have to actually practice your plan			2
it 's got to be a living plan , and you practice it often			2
" need a plan ? steal @entity15 's			1
" i encourage plagiarizing , " he said			0
( you got ta love a cop who encourages you to steal			0
) what threat do foreign jihadists pose ? lock - down drills are " not a silver bullet , " @entity15 acknowledges			1
" @entity202 to say , there is no silver bullet			1
if the bad buy gets in your space , it 's time to attack or flee , " he said			0
but , @entity15 says , if the @entity34 can do it , with its 500 stores , huge eatery , and indoor amusement park , your shopping mall can do it too			1
and they will , he says , if they care more about protecting people than merchandise .			2

mall security **focuses** on protecting merchandise
retired cop @entity15 came up with a plan that **focuses** on shoppers
mall of @entity34 does lockdown drills , *similar* to what schools practice
drills are n't a " silver bullet , " but they could minimize potential harm , @entity15 says
