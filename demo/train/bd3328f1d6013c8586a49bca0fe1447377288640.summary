@entity0 -- if president @entity2 decides to send the 40,000 additional forces to @entity4 as requested by gen. @entity5 , a rough estimate by the @entity8 projects the cost could be an additional $ 20 billion a year , according to a senior @entity8 official			1
the official said the @entity8 comptrollers office has told @entity13 that based on rough estimates , the total cost of keeping an individual service member in the war zone is now about $ 500,000 a year			1
that includes the costs of personnel operations and maintenance costs , some equipment and hazardous duty pay			0
the actual costs could be higher , because the estimate does not include the cost of constructing additional facilities , providing support forces such as military intelligence assets that may be based outside @entity4 or replacing damaged weapons or equipment			2
the official emphasized that until there is a formal troop plan , the costs are just estimated			0
the official would not be identified because the estimates are not official			0
the ongoing review of the strategy for @entity4 continued friday , with @entity2 meeting with defense secretary @entity40 ; adm. @entity41 , the chairman of the @entity43 ; and the heads of the four military services			1
the heads of the @entity47 and @entity48 , who provide the bulk of troops for the war , have expressed concern that if they send a large number of additional troops , they will have to cut down on the time troops spend in between deployments , known as " dwell time			1
" @entity48 have only about 8,000 troops they can add without impinging on dwell time			1
the @entity47 has about 12 brigades , or approximately 48,000 soldiers , that are not deployed or committed to deploy			0
regardless of the number of troops being sent , a deployment will be phased over time because of the lack of facilities in the country to house and support a large deployment , the official said			2
@entity5 's plan calls for sending a majority of the forces he is requesting to the south , especially to reinforce @entity79 and @entity80 provinces , and the region around @entity84 , several military and @entity8 sources said			0
@entity5 also intends to reserve a number of forces for training @entity4 forces , officials said			2
but one official noted that if that plan is put into effect , additional forces would be needed to be sent to areas that the @entity94 might then flee , such as the northern region .			0
