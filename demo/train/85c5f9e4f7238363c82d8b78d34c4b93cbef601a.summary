the scene was somber , sullen and mostly silent outside the @entity2 coal mine			1
but every so often , the grief came out loud and clear			0
" enough for the life for me ! " yelled one woman -- her arms flailing , tears running down her cheeks -- according to video from @entity2 broadcaster @entity9			1
" let this mine take my life , too ! " as she was pulled away , she added , " enough is enough			2
" sadly , the torment for her and many others is n't over			0
yes , rescuers did save at least 88 miners in the frantic moments after a power transformer blew up tuesday during shift change at the mine in the western @entity2 city of @entity23 , sparking a choking fire deep inside			1
but another 274 are known dead , according to @entity2 's @entity25 and @entity26			1
those who underwent autopsies died of carbon monoxide poisoning , energy minister @entity27 said			0
there is every expectation that number will grow			0
prime minister @entity34 said wednesday as many as 120 more were trapped inside the mine , though that was before rescue crews grimly hurried a series of stretchers -- at least some clearly carrying corpses -- past the waiting crowd			1
as helicopters buzzed overheard and flags flew at half - staff , police and rescue workers were everywhere on the scene wednesday night			2
but for most , there was precious little they could do			0
the smoke rose from openings in the ground showed the continuing dangers both to those trapped and anyone who dared try to get them			2
rescue volunteer @entity56 told the @entity58 team at the mine that conditions inside the mine were abominable -- hot , smoky and filled with carbon monoxide			1
authorities worked to pump in good air into the mine , so they could get in			2
however , as @entity70 , a former top @entity72 mine safety official points out , sending in oxygen likely would " increase the likelihood that the fire would grow and continue to put those miners at risk			1
" these stiff challenges notwithstanding , rescuers have n't given up hope that some miners reached emergency chambers stocked with gas masks and air			2
" if they could reach those emergency rooms and reach their gas masks and close the doors and protect those emergency areas from the poison gas , then they could survive , " @entity56 said			0
we are ready for anything			0
" but @entity27 , speaking earlier , said " hopes are diminishing " of rescuing anyone yet inside the mine			1
@entity93 has already given up			0
the miner knew that four of his friends -- at least -- are dead			2
" it 's too late , " said @entity93			2
" there 's no more hope			1
" political fallout the trauma from what already looks like the worst mine disaster in @entity2 history has left @entity23 and the rest of @entity2 in shock and , in some cases , in anger			1
the latest death toll already tops a mining accident in the 1990s that took 260 lives			0
even as officials in the @entity72 and elsewhere offered their condolences to his people , @entity34 found himself on the defensive			1
opposition politician @entity117 from the @entity119 region had filed a proposal in late april to investigate @entity2 mines after repeated deadly accidents			1
in some incidents three people died , in others , five , said opposition spokesman @entity126			0
and @entity117 wanted to get to the bottom of the deaths			0
several dozen members of opposition parties signed on to his proposal , but the conservative government overturned it			0
some of its members publicly lampooned it , he said			0
@entity34 questioned @entity117 's version , and said the mine had passed safety inspections as recently as march			1
the mine , owned by @entity142 , underwent regular inspections in the past three years , two of them this march , @entity2 's government said			1
inspectors reported no violation of health and safety laws			0
the company has taken down its regular website and replaced it with a single web page in all black containing a message of condolence			0
not everyone in @entity23 , at least , has sided with @entity34 , who canceled a trip to @entity156 to tour the rescue effort and speak to relatives of dead and injured miners			1
he was met by a chorus of jeers as well as chants of " resign prime minister ! " while walking through the city wednesday , according to @entity9 video			0
video from that network , social media messages and pictures posted to @entity168 showed hundreds participating in anti-government protests in @entity172 and @entity173 , with police answering in some cases with water cannons and tear gas			0
while not focused on mine safety , such demonstrations railing against @entity34 and his government have been commonplace in @entity2 in recent months , as has the police responding with water cannons and tear gas			1
in the nation 's capital of @entity173 , some called for silent demonstration to " stand for humanity			0
" others left black coffins in front of the @entity191 and the @entity193 and @entity194 ministry buildings			1
that grim symbol speaks to the sadness permeating @entity2 , whatever one 's political bent			1
for @entity204 , the miner waiting by the tunnel entrance for more of his friends to emerge , the mourning may go on much longer than the three days ordered by @entity34			2
after what 's happened , he said , he 'll never work in a mine again			2
2 @entity209 coal miners killed			0

protesters lay symbolic coffins at government buildings , rail against @entity34
274 are *confirmed* dead after an *explosion* , fire inside a mine in western @entity2
88 workers made it out of the mine ; dozens may be trapped
@entity225 says there 's " no hope " that anyone else is still alive
