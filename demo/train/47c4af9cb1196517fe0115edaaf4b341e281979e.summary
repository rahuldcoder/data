@entity0 -- seated @entity5 , @entity3 magnate @entity2 and his son , @entity4 , told @entity7 lawmakers tuesday they were not to blame in a burgeoning scandal that has raised questions of how much top executives knew about illegal phone hacking and when			1
testy exchanges peppered the nearly three hours of questioning by members of a parliamentary committee who pressed the father and son for answers on who may have authorized or known of reporters ' hacking of voice mails			1
asked by one lawmaker , " do you accept that ultimately you are responsible for this whole fiasco ? " @entity2 simply responded : " no. " after declaring it was " the most humble day of my life , " the elder @entity2 let @entity29 do most of the talking			1
when called upon , @entity2 indicated he knew little of the day - to - day details of his holdings and that he might hear more from a @entity34 editor about extra soccer coverage than a payout to a phone hacking victim			1
asked whether he had considered resigning , @entity2 replied : " no , because i feel that the people i trusted , i do n't know at what level , let me down and i think they behaved disgracefully , betrayed the company and me , and it 's for them to pay			1
" " i think that frankly i 'm the best person to clear this up , " he added			0
the @entity43 also heard from former top executive @entity44 , who testified she never paid a policeman or sanctioned a payment to police			1
journalists at the now - defunct @entity34 are accused of bribing police to get private details about people , including members of the royal family			1
lawmakers seated at a horseshoe - shaped table quizzed the @entity56 about out - of - court settlements and employee actions			2
but it was an unexpected moment , well into the testimony , that was destined for video highlights			0
a protester tossed a plate of light - blue shaving cream at @entity2 , 80 , prompting a brief recess			1
" you greedy billionaire , " the man said , as he hit @entity29 with the foam			2
@entity2 's wife , @entity69 , who was seated behind him , leapt to her feet and smashed the attacker 's hand with her own			1
@entity7 is in an uproar over the scandal , which could have global implications			2
it began with the phone - hacking claims involving reporters from @entity34 -- which led its parent company , @entity3 , to shut down the paper -- and quickly broadened into allegations that journalists had paid police for confidential information			1
tuesday 's hearing was widely anticipated and the @entity56 , wearing conservative suits and ties , expressed contrition early on			1
@entity2 hesitated often when answering questions , and @entity4 often tried to intercede , saying he could delve into details of internal @entity3 investigations			1
the pair said the company has willingly forwarded information to criminal investigators once it became aware of it			0
while @entity2 said he could not know in any detail the actions of his 53,000 employees , committee member @entity98 reminded the elder @entity2 several times he is in charge of corporate governance -- the culture and policies of a business entity			1
when @entity29 tried to intervene on a point , @entity98 stopped him , saying , " your father is responsible , and serious wrongdoing has been brought about in the company and it 's revealing in itself what he does n't know and what executives chose not to tell him			1
" @entity2 said no one brought to his attention the fact that @entity118 , a senior @entity34 reporter , had been found guilty of trying to blackmail women			1
@entity2 said he and his son were not guilty of willful blindness to the company 's problems			1
@entity125 , a member of the parliamentary committee , told @entity1 after the hearing that she and others were surprised by how little @entity2 knew of some details			1
@entity2 told the @entity131 committee he has seen " no evidence " that victims of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the @entity135 were victims of phone hacking by his employees , and he does not believe it happened			1
the @entity140 is investigating @entity3 over the claim , made by a @entity7 newspaper			2
in his testimony , @entity29 said he had " no knowledge " that @entity144 and @entity145 , another @entity146 senior official -- both of whom have resigned in the past week -- knew of the extent of phone hacking at the @entity34			2
he told lawmakers he had " no evidence " they did anything wrong			0
explaining why he had previously given inaccurate statements to the committee , @entity29 said senior @entity3 officials had learned about the extent of phone hacking by their employees as a result of civil lawsuits against @entity34 in late 2010			1
he said those in charge were determined " both to put things right , make sure these things do n't happen again , and to be the company that i know that we have always aspired to be			0
" reading a statement at the conclusion of the hearing , @entity2 said : " @entity4 and i would like to say how sorry we are for what has happened -- especially with regard to listening to the voice mail of victims of crime			1
" he said that in his 57 years at the head of his company , " at no time do i remember being as sickened as when i heard what the @entity180 family had to endure -- nor do i recall being as angry as when i was told that the @entity34 could have compounded their distress			0
@entity183 was a missing girl whose phone was allegedly hacked			2
she was later found dead			0
revelations that journalists working for @entity34 had eavesdropped on her phone and deleted some of her messages to make room for more brought the scandal , which had been simmering for years , to a boil			2
asked how much he knew about day - to - day operations , @entity2 said the disgraced sunday tabloid @entity34 accounted for less than 1 % of his @entity3 he had " perhaps lost sight " of what was happening at the newspaper , he acknowledged			1
@entity144 , the former editor of @entity34 who went on to become chief executive of its parent company , @entity199 , also appeared before the committee tuesday to answer questions			0
she said @entity199 acted " quickly and decisively " to investigate internally when the extent of the phone hacking became clear and the company had passed the new information to the police			1
@entity144 said she was aware that @entity34 used private detectives , and believed every national newspaper in the @entity7 did the same			0
but she said she has never met @entity211 , the private investigator accused of carrying out mass phone hacking for her paper , and did not hear his name until 2006			2
@entity144 was editor of the best - selling sunday tabloid at the time of some of the most serious allegations against it			0
she resigned july 15 over the scandal and was arrested and questioned by police two days later			2
her lawyer , @entity223 , said monday his client is not guilty of any crime			0
conservative politician @entity226 , who was among the lawmakers to quiz both the @entity56 and @entity144 , told @entity1 she believed the trio had given " full and frank answers " while presenting their version of events			0
the thrust of the committee 's questioning was that they should have known what was happening at the @entity34 , rather than relying on other people , @entity226 said			0
the ripples of the affair have reached as far as @entity7 prime minister @entity241 , who is cutting short a trip to @entity243 to return to @entity0 and deal with the crisis			0
@entity241 has faced strong criticism in recent days over his decision to hire @entity247 , a former @entity34 editor who resigned as @entity241 's spokesman after his newspaper staff were jailed for hacking voice mails			2
@entity247 , who resigned his government post in january , has since been arrested			0
@entity241 on tuesday vowed to " stop the obscenity of hacking and get to the bottom of what happened , " then put in place measures to prevent such problems from recurring			0
" the police have serious questions to answer about potential corruption and a failed investigation			0
politicians have been too close to media owners , " @entity241 told reporterse in @entity264 , part of a two - day @entity243 trip			0
the prime minister is expected to answer questions wednesday during a debate on the scandal in the @entity273			0
both @entity144 and @entity247 , who are free on bail , deny knowledge of wrongdoing			0
earlier , the head of @entity0 's @entity278 and his deputy -- both of whom have resigned -- appeared before a different committee of @entity131			1
commissioner @entity283 and assistant commissioner @entity284 defended their actions in failing to authorize a more thorough investigation into the use of phone hacking , following a july 2009 article in the @entity291 newspaper revealing that tactic had been far more broadly used than previously reported			2
@entity283 said he did not pressure the @entity291 to drop its investigation , while @entity284 said he had no reason at the time to believe the situation was serious enough to warrant a full - scale investigation			0
they also defended their hiring of a former @entity34 editor , @entity300 , for a public relations job at the department			0
@entity300 was arrested last week in connection with the investigation			0
@entity284 also said he had nothing to do with helping secure a job for @entity300 ' daughter			0
@entity2 's @entity3 encompasses @entity308 , @entity309 , the @entity310 , and @entity312 publishers in the @entity135			1
@entity199 -- a @entity7 subsidiary of @entity3 -- owns the @entity313 , @entity314 and the @entity315 in @entity7			2
@entity1 's @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 and @entity323 contributed to this report .			0
