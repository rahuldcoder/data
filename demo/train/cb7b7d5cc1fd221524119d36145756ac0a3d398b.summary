-- last week , nearly 40 billionaires announced their intention to give half their wealth to charity at the encouragement of bridge - playing buddies @entity7 and @entity8			1
this unprecedented action brought to mind @entity11 's famous line about the @entity13 plan as " the most unsordid act in the whole of human history			0
" there has lately been dark talk of the @entity19 and @entity21 exceptionalism slipping away , but i believe this billionaire compact shows both are alive and well			1
the majority of individuals on this self - selecting list are self - made men and women who built their fortunes in their own lifetime			0
among them are @entity34 mayor @entity33 and @entity36 ceo @entity35			0
separately , it was announced earlier this week that the estate of the late @entity39 was also donating more than $ 150 million to a charitable foundation			0
it 's difficult to imagine any other nation in history whose wealthiest individuals would voluntarily decide to give half their wealth to charity , not only at home , but around the world			0
and whether the money goes to cure river blindness in @entity53 or help finance charter schools in this country , it is something that reflects well upon the @entity21			2
those who pledge do us proud			0
there is another issue raised by the billionaires ' compact , beyond the increasing gap between rich and poor in the @entity21			1
it is the gap between the " super rich " -- who really do have more money than they know what to do with -- and what might be called the " working wealthy , " who are taxed as though they 're rich enough to able to give away half their money			1
these are individuals whose household income might bring them into the top tax bracket of $ 250,000 a year but who , with two parents working , might still find themselves struggling to stay in the stability of the upper - middle class in the expensive urban areas where they often work			1
much of the anger about the scheduled sunset of the @entity87 tax cuts for the increase in top - bracket taxes comes from this productive group of @entity21			1
the super rich are looking for charitable donations to deduct from their taxes each year , while the working wealthy are still trying to pay all their bills			1
but they are taxed at the same rate as the private jet set ( what a few years ago might been called the @entity100 crowd )			0
the super-rich rule high finance or might have started a high - tech company before the bubble			2
in contrast , the working wealthy might include someone who owns a small business or works as a mid-level executive in a top - line traditional corporation			1
but they are the ones most feeling the squeeze of expectations in the @entity112 , while getting lumped in with the super rich			2
let 's be clear : the working wealthy are n't suffering in any objective sense , but they feel they are paying most of the taxes and getting few of the benefits			1
small - business owners create almost 70 percent of the new jobs in @entity21 , and they are the ones who feel most left out of the current economic recovery			2
at the same time , the @entity123 shows that the number of millionaires is increasing in cities across the country			0
and the bankers who triggered the economic collapse got billions in bailout money and even got to keep some of their taxpayer - subsidized bonuses			0
the forgotten @entity21 middle class saw no real gains in income over the past decade despite the tax cuts because of rising health care and energy costs			1
big business and big government seem indifferent to the struggles of small businesses , and it 's got small - business owners feeling angry and alienated , like forgotten @entity21 citizens			2
meanwhile , politicians slobber over the super rich for campaign donations while they pander to voters with class - warfare populism			1
the billionaires ' compact is worth viewing with uncynical eyes			0
it is an historic and selfless attempt to leave the world a better place			0
and if the charitable contributions are directed carefully , funding innovation and fostering independence ( like @entity160 's public libraries did a century ago ) , rather than dependence , then they can help more people to achieve their own @entity21 dreams			0
but the stark fact is that such largess in a time of recession also highlights the growing gaps in our society , not just between the rich and poor , but between the super rich , the working wealthy and the forgotten middle class			1
@entity21 remains a meritocracy with long odds and high - payouts -- and is infinitely better than any alternative			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

@entity177 says 40 billionaires ' pledge of fortune is *inspiring* act of @entity21 exceptionalism
but he says it points up gap between the " super rich " and " working wealthy " **couples**
these $ 250k **couples** may be in @entity7 tax bracket , but struggle to stay in upper - middle class
@entity177 : working wealthy are n't suffering , but they pay high taxes , get few benefits
