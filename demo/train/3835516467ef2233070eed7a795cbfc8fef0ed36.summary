-- @entity1 released details about its upcoming @entity4 console during a news conference thursday			1
but , as happens in the age of social media , reactions began pouring in just as fast as the facts were coming out			2
the @entity14 game company made announcements in @entity14 , the @entity16 and @entity17 , each one talking about the three main points everyone has been wanting to know : when will wii u be available , how much will it cost , and what games can i play on it ? prices and release dates vary around the world , but @entity16 gamers will get first crack november 18			1
a basic version of the console package will sell for $ 299 , while a " deluxe " version -- including additional memory , a stand and charger for the @entity29 , and the " @entity31 " game -- will go for $ 349			1
reaction in the gaming community ranged dramatically from joy to pessimism			0
as prices for the two versions of the console were announced , a split seemed to form over whether the @entity4 was too expensive for what it appears to be offering			1
@entity44 , a commenter on the @entity0 story , said , " @entity47 ca n't see myself spending money on another product like this			0
i 'll wait for the 720 ( @entity52 whatever it is called ) or the @entity54 ( @entity55 ) 4			0
" @entity57 host and reality - tv vet @entity56 joked on @entity59 , " not a fan of the @entity4 's price but i 'm getting it for my kid because even though the child has n't been born yet i will buy his / her affection			1
" however , others were just as quick to point out the history of new console release prices			2
@entity59 user @entity69 reminded people what the @entity72 cost when it came out in 2006			0
" i still do n't get the fuss over the @entity4 price , " he tweeted			1
" the @entity72 was five hundred ninety - nine dollars at launch			0
" a @entity59 user in the @entity78 offered an international perspective on the price battle			2
@entity81 tweeted , " dear @entity16 friends , please stop complaining that the @entity83 is $ 350			2
in the @entity78 , it will be Â £ 330 ( $ 533 ) and ship without a sensor bar ! ! ! " if it was n't the dollars ( or yen or euros ) being discussed , the topic centered on the games being offered			1
@entity1 president @entity89 said that more than 50 games would be available from the launch to the end of march but did n't say specifically which titles would be available at launch			1
some games drew more attention than others			2
" @entity106 " was announced as a @entity4 exclusive , drawing howls of protest and disbelief from many on social media who enjoyed the original on other consoles			1
others were excited about the news			0
@entity109 from @entity110 wrote on @entity59 , " well i guess i 'm gunna have to buy a @entity4 now since @entity106 is only going to be on that platform			1
i apologize to my @entity52 and @entity72			0
" the variety of announced titles tried to hit as many different genres and fan bases as possible			0
many people found at least one game that attracted them to the new wii u console			2
@entity119 , commenting on the @entity121 story , wrote , " sold			0
i was almost positive that i was getting a @entity4 before , but with @entity122 coming ... please , take my money			1
" video game writer @entity124 said on @entity59 , " @entity31 sold me on the @entity126 of fun with those games today			2
never mind the brilliance of @entity130 ( " @entity130 " ) and lots of others			0
" @entity133 added , " looking at @entity134 changed my opinion of @entity4			1
hope @entity1 release more than a handful of games aimed at adults this time			1
" despite reports of brisk pre-orders , other people urged caution and patience before rushing out to get the new console			0
some are worried @entity1 is just playing catch - up to @entity148 and @entity149 , and wonder what happens when their new consoles arrive			1
" i do n't hate the # @entity4 , but there 's nothing yet that demands a day 1 buy , " wrote @entity152 on @entity59			1
" can we not be nintendo fanboys just this once please internet ? " @entity160 is concerned about next - generation consoles			0
" what 's so special about the @entity4 ? it 's just a wii with @entity72 graphics and a tablet			1
come on @entity1 be more creative ! " " i 'm still not impressed			2
if it 's only ' on par with current consoles ' ... the ones that are at the end of their cycle ... that 's scary , " wrote @entity167 ( @entity59 handle : @ reluctant_gamer )			0
still , commenters generally agreed that the @entity4 will sell well in the beginning , pointing out how successful the @entity4 console sold on launch			1
the trick is to sustain that initial momentum , many say , will be releasing a stable of good games people will want to play			0
two game reviewers said they were hopeful for the outlook for the new console			0
@entity187 , video game columnist for the @entity189 , said , " i 'm optimistic because of more info on good exclusives			0
plus it seems genuinely different from the rest of the crowd			0
i 'm up for a change of pace			0
" and a @entity59 post by @entity198 , senior editor for the @entity199 , may sum up the overall feelings of many about the @entity4 -- at least for now			2
" @entity4 : more expensive than i 'd like , software focus on casual , but a ton of potential			2
overall ? ca n't wait			0
" what do you think about @entity1 's announcement ? let us know in the comments below .			1
