-- @entity2 officials are tight - lipped , but the @entity3 says it knows why federal agents wanted telephone records of its reporters			0
a may 7 , 2012 , @entity3 story broke the news that the @entity10 had thwarted an @entity12 plot to blow up a @entity14 - bound jetliner around the anniversary of the killing of @entity17 by @entity14 commandos			1
the story , which included reporting by five staffers , said the plot was significant in part because the @entity23 had told the public that it had no information about planned attacks around the anniversary			0
it came two - and - a - half years after a similar attempt by @entity12 operative @entity30 , who concealed a bomb in his underwear and unsuccessfully attempted to detonate it on a flight to @entity35			0
the 2012 attempt involved a more sophisticated bomb , the @entity3 reported			1
" the @entity3 learned about the thwarted plot last week but agreed to @entity23 and @entity10 requests not to publish it immediately because the sensitive intelligence operation was still under way , " the news agency report stated			2
" once officials said those concerns were allayed , the @entity3 decided to disclose the plot monday despite requests from the @entity48 administration to wait for an official announcement tuesday			0
" sources later told @entity0 that the operative who was supposed to have carried the bomb had been inserted into @entity12 's @entity54 affiliate by @entity56 intelligence , and that the device had been handed over to @entity14 analysts			1
one source said @entity56 counterterrorism officials were upset that details of the operation had emerged in the @entity14 because they had a network of agents inside the @entity54 branch who could have been compromised by leaks from @entity68			2
without confirming the focus of the probe , attorney general @entity69 said tuesday that the disclosure was " within the top two or three most serious leaks i 've ever seen			1
" " it put the @entity14 people at risk , and that is not hyperbole , " he said			1
@entity69 said he has recused himself from the investigation after being questioned by @entity81 agents as part of the probe , but he defended the @entity2 's decision to subpoena the @entity3 records			1
@entity3 president @entity86 has called the subpoenas -- which the news agency learned of last week -- a " massive and unprecedented intrusion " into its reporting			0
" finally , they say this secrecy is important for national security , " @entity86 wrote to deputy attorney general @entity91 on tuesday			2
" it is always difficult to respond to that , particularly since they still have n't told us specifically what they are investigating			0

the @entity3 says the leak probe centers on a may 2012 story on a failed bomb plot
attorney general @entity69 says the revelation " put the @entity14 people at risk "
the operative involved had been planted by @entity56 intelligence , sources told @entity0
