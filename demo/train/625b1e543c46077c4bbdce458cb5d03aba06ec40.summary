@entity0 -- dozens of lawmakers support legislation that would set up a more streamlined system for matching @entity9 orphans with families in the @entity3 , a @entity3 senator said tuesday			1
sen. @entity11 , @entity12 , said that the initial focus of the legislation would be on children orphaned by the january 12 earthquake in @entity9 but that in the long term , it also would address other adoption efforts			1
she and other senators will press this week to get the families for @entity21 out of a @entity23 committee so it can go to the floor for a vote , she said at a news conference			2
the bill would set up a separate office in the @entity30 to handle adoption issues , similar to the office that handles human trafficking , @entity11 said			1
the office would focus on the issues of orphans and adoptions			1
" the old regular process , the old regular bureaucracy , is not going to work , " she said			1
find loved ones in @entity9 share your story @entity45 , deputy spokesman for the @entity30 , said there are about 1,200 pending adoption cases			1
the department says that 497 orphans have come to the @entity3 since the january 12 earthquake and have been united with their adoptive parents			1
that number includes 100 orphans who arrived tuesday , @entity45 said			0
" we will continue to work until we get through all pending cases , " he said			2
" but we will send no child out of @entity9 who does not have cleared , vetted and accepted parents waiting for him or her in the @entity3 " an exception will be made if a child needs urgent medical attention or has some other dire problem , he said			1
" we are determined to thwart traffickers and are not processing new applications for adoptions , " he added			2
last week , the @entity30 said it was working with the @entity68 and the @entity9 government to process nearly 300 cases of @entity3 who were waiting to adopt @entity9 children			1
of those , 200 cases were being accelerated , the agency said			0
the department said that some of those orphans are eligible to come to the @entity3 under a humanitarian waiver , unless they can be issued permanent papers			1
before the quake , 380,000 children in @entity9 were classified as orphans , @entity11 said , quoting figures from the @entity84 , which defines an orphan as someone who has lost one parent			1
the first priority , she said , is to reunite a child with its family , or to find other relatives or a family in @entity9 willing to adopt the child			0
on tuesday , the @entity30 said 497 @entity9 orphans had been evacuated to the @entity3 since the quake			1
sen. @entity96 , @entity97 said the red tape in @entity0 should n't slow down the adoption process for @entity9 children			1
sen. @entity100 , @entity101 , agreed			2
" we have to have a better process here			0
these are extraordinary circumstances , " she said			0
last week , 14 orphans heading to @entity107 were n't allowed to leave @entity9 because they had no papers , said rep. @entity109 , @entity107 , who had gone to @entity9 to accompany the group to the @entity3			2
the paperwork was lost in the quake , he added			2
finally , with intervention from several agencies and the @entity116 , the @entity3 @entity113 approved humanitarian waivers , or paroles , for the children			1
several senators at the briefing mentioned the need to keep children safe from human trafficking while they are awaiting travel or in transit			2
their concerns echoed those expressed by charities , aid groups and @entity9 officials in recent days			0
" we know there have been reports that children left the country without going through the authorization of the prime minister or other authorities , " @entity132 , chief of child protection for the @entity134 , said sunday			0
" we have such reports			0
we are trying to discuss with different authorities to find a solution to prevent trafficking of children			0
... " but it 's very difficult to have the overall picture at the moment			0
it 's overwhelming particularly because there is no registration system			0
so now that is what we are trying to do : have registration of children so that we have a better idea , " @entity132 said			0
according to @entity9 's minister of communication , @entity162 - @entity161 , " the @entity9 government is very clear on this			0
we are facilitating all of the adoption applications already submitted			0
other than those , no child will be leaving the country for adoption , only those whose applications are already on file			0
" @entity171 , a child protection officer for the @entity172 to @entity9 , said workers are trying to identify the children at risk , " the ones who are along without family , and to respond as quickly as possible to the lack of protection of children during this disaster			0
" groups including @entity184 and @entity185 have called for a halt to adoptions , saying that many children who may appear to be orphaned have simply been separated from their families .			1

lawmaker says new system would ease adoptions by @entity3 families
focus would be on children orphaned in quake , sen. @entity11 says
