" all my homies i 'd been in the business with over 20 years			2
( i told them , ) ' i 'm just going to ask you questions , not about the money , the cars , the jewelry , the beef , but the craft			1
' " in an earlier interview , the star of " @entity47 : @entity53 " noted that there was an abundance of rap stars who wanted to appear in his documentary			1

i had 35 rappers waiting to be shot			2
my first edit was four hours , so i just could n't fit everybody into the movie , so yeah , there 's a lot of people missing , but i think i was able to get a good cross-section of the different styles of hip - hop			1
" his decades in the rap game allowed him insider access and candid interviews			2
" i was kind of surprised at how open the guys got and just had fun in front of the camera , " @entity10 said			0

" nothing but respect to the soldiers coming home from the war , " he said			0
" as far as something i can tell them to do , this might sound cold , but do n't expect anybody to care			0
