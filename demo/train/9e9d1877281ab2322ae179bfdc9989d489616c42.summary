-- old cars do n't die , they just get resold			2
check out a vehicle history report to make sure your new used car wo n't blow smoke down the highway			2
if you 're buying a used car , whether from a dealer or someone who put an ad in the paper , you 'll want to know as much about it as you can			2
even without anyone trying to deceive you , the vehicle may have problems you ca n't see from a simple visual inspection or even a short test drive			0
a vehicle history report prepared by a third party is one way to know what you 're getting			0
combining information from state dmvs ( @entity24 ) and @entity25 ) as well as police reports and other sources , a vehicle history report can give you a comprehensive overview of where the car 's been			1
here are some things to look for -- or look out for -- when you get a report on a vehicle			0
none of these things is necessarily a reason not to buy a car , but you should n't make a decision without asking about anything you see on a vehicle history : many owners the more garages a car 's been in , the less likely it 's been lovingly cared for all its life			1
not everyone is as responsible about car care as you are			2
rental cars and former taxis , for example , will often have undergone a lot of abuse , although they tend to be quite inexpensive			1
location , location , location some parts of the country are more car - friendly than others			1
winter storms ( with their accompanying salted roads ) can be rough on cars , as obviously can floods , excessive heat or even sea air			1
cars that have been where these are common may have hidden damage			0
name and description be sure the car in the report is the same as the car you 're looking at			0
carefully reviewing the vehicle description is one way to avoid various types of vehicle fraud , like @entity86 cloning			1
a cloned vehicle involves using a vehicle identification number ( @entity86 ) from a legally owned , non-stolen vehicle to mask the identity of a similar make / model stolen vehicle			1
reports , should include detailed descriptions of the vehicle , so you can make sure the car you 're reading about is the same as the one you 're looking at			0
suspicious markings keep an eye out for records of body work that might indicate a prior unreported incident			1
vehicle history reports , like those from @entity106 , can be very comprehensive			0
in the case of @entity106 , the company 's database contains more than five billion records from thousands of public and private sources , including all dmvs in the @entity113 and @entity114 and thousands of vehicle inspection stations , auto auctions , fleet management and rental agencies , automobile manufacturers , and fire and police departments .			0

if a car has a lot of previous owners , it 's more likely to be not - well cared for
a car from the north would be more affected by damaging winter storms
@entity86 cloning is a type of fraud where stolen cars use fake *legitimate* numbers
body work could indicate an unreported *accident*
