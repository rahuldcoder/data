@entity0 -- turn down any rundown street in any one of the " @entity3 " that now pepper @entity5 's cities , and you 'll see young men congregating outside what look like shuttered shop fronts			1
there are no signs and no distinguishing features to help those who do n't know what lies on the other side of these battered doorways			0
the chances are you will have stumbled over a marfish -- the cafes @entity5 @entity20 come to chew the vegetable stimulant , khat			1
although khat is legal in the @entity5 , marfishes are closed off to outsiders			2
one marfish we attempted to enter had a surveillance camera overlooking the locked doorway -- we were repeatedly refused entry			0
see high - res gallery of years of chaos in @entity20 in the past , journalists have been attacked for attempting to report on the goings - on inside the cafes			1
for years , marfishes are been believed to be at the center of criminal activity , and now , @entity1 has learned , they may also be a recruiting ground for @entity41 militants			1
@entity42 is an anti-khat campaigner in the @entity5 , and knows only too well the paranoia and isolation khat addiction engenders in the young men in the marfishes			1
seven years ago he was one of them			0
" young people become vulnerable , not clearly thinking and the paranoia kicks in and that 's when they start to hate the @entity5 public -- especially the police , " @entity42 told us			1
" they are thinking everybody is out to get them and that 's exactly the kind of individuals the likes of @entity60 are targeting			2
" the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) estimates that @entity5 now make up a quarter of foreign fighters in @entity20 , and says @entity60 is stepping up its effort to make the most of this fertile recruiting ground			1
" they are moving forward , changing their techniques , " @entity42 says , " so it 's no longer the @entity69 and in the @entity70 they are targeting			0
there have been some cases here in the @entity5 where the young people have been taken away from marfishes back to @entity20			1
there are now young people in the marfishes as we speak who are missing and we do n't know where they are			2
" the families of many of these young men were too afraid to speak to us but @entity1 has confirmed that as recently as last month two young men aged 18 and 20 have been reported missing in @entity0			2
both were khat addicts and both their families are convinced they have been recruited to fight by @entity60			2
and that -- as one relative told us -- is effectively a death sentence			0
@entity92 territory for @entity60 in chaos of @entity20 the @entity5 - @entity20 community is one of the @entity5 's oldest immigrant communities , tracing their roots to seamen who traveled to the @entity5 in the 19th century			1
but they have also had one of the most difficult experiences of integration			0
according to the @entity5 government 's own figures , @entity5 - @entity20 have the highest unemployment rates of any immigrant community , only 50 percent have any educational qualifications , with only 3 percent gaining higher education qualifications			1
unemployment especially feeds into the cycle of depression , addiction and alienation that extremists prey on			0
it is not just in the marfishes that young @entity20 are being targeted for radicalization ; the internet is now a treasure trove for radicals and @entity60 boasts of having dozens of recruiters online at all hours in pro-jihad internet forums , even tailoring their videos in @entity124 to their target audience			1
even those families who know their children are safely at home are not immune from extremists			0
one @entity20 mother we interviewed , whose son was recruited by @entity60 online , told us her experience is an all too common one in the @entity5 @entity20 community			1
" my son was a good outgoing boy , active , loved by many people			0
he started changing by becoming addicted to the internet , [ he went on ] many different sites like @entity139 and @entity140			0
i started noticing a change in him , he started saying : ' mum , take me abroad to study @entity41			0
' i supported him as any mother would			0
i took him to @entity143			0
after weeks staying in the school he disappeared ; little did i know he had already been planning this			0
" she asked that we not identify her : she says although she was able to convince him to leave @entity20 she still lives in fear that either the @entity5 authorities or the militant group itself will one day come after him			1
she told us she hopes other parents will be able to guard their children from what happened to hers			0
but it 's not just her experience that is a common one , the fear she lives with is also shared by many of the @entity5 - @entity20 we spoke to			1
only a handful would allow us to film them and most were suspicious of how their stories would be used			0
even those who had no direct experience or involvement with extremism were terrified that on any given night they might get a knock on the door from a police officer accusing them of terrorism or -- worse still -- an e-mail or a voicemail threat from @entity60 for being " un-islamic " or a " traitor			2
" to an outsider like me , none of these fears seem founded , but for @entity20 in the @entity5 much of what they thought they 'd left behind in their war - ravaged homeland appears to have followed them here			1
and as the world finally moves to act cohesively on @entity20 , many of them no longer believe that anywhere is truly safe .			2

*analysts* believe @entity5 now make up quarter of foreign fighters in @entity20
@entity60 stepping up effort to make most of this fertile recruiting ground
young @entity20 targeted for radicalization in cafes in @entity0 , and on internet
@entity20 in @entity5 fear children will be recruited by @entity60 , or arrested by police
