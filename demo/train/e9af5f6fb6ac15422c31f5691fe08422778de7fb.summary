-- it is easy to criticize zoos and aquariums when healthy animals are culled , particularly when they are from endangered species			1
it 's not always easy to understand the logic behind such a decision , but to get a picture of why good zoos take particular actions , one has to understand the context and the alternatives			2
wild populations of animals are collapsing at an alarming rate			2
since 1997 , for example , the population of giraffes in @entity19 has plummeted by more than 50 % , with two subspecies becoming extinct in the wild , and leaving only 240 members of another subspecies in a single population center			0
this pattern is replicated all over the world ; it is driven by our increasing need for natural resources such as palm oil , agricultural land , or living space			0
animal reserves in the most vulnerable areas are struggling to protect their animals from the scourge of poachers , while other habitats are destroyed by the effects of deforestation and increasingly climate change , a problem that all of the world 's governments acting in concert have been unable to check even slightly			1
indeed , governments have been unable even to uphold their obligations under the @entity51 to assist in the protection of endangered species and to teach their populations about the value of biological diversity , obligations that have been almost entirely outsourced to zoos and museums			0
@entity59 inherited a legacy of animal keeping from a previous age that did not understand the havoc we are wreaking on the planet			0
since the establishment of national and regional zoo associations and the dawning of greater scientific understanding of our effect on nature , zoos have become essentially a last line of defense in the protection of animals			1
do we wish that humans would stop destroying the natural habitats of wild animals ? of course ; but this is not happening			2
our choice then is clear : do we use the legacy we inherited to protect animals from human activity , or do we leave them to take their chances , knowing that their chances of survival are slim and for many species almost impossible ? if we accept that some action is better than none , then we also have to accept that managing viable populations of animals over the long term until their habitats are stabilized requires some difficult decisions , including the culling of healthy animals that wo n't help the species stay adaptable and immune to disease			1
it 's worth remembering that some of the world 's foremost biologists , population biologists , animal geneticists and other experts have thought deeply and philosophically about these choices			1
faced with the alternatives , it 's not hard to see why they chose as they did			0
say we did stop zoos from breeding and transformed them into " sanctuaries " ; immediately we would need to give up the notion that we can save our most endangered species from extinction -- the infrastructure in the wild just is n't there for some species and in many @entity127 zoos we care for species that are already extinct in the wild			2
next we would need to decide what to do with the animals : should we keep them in these new sanctuaries , unable to breed , until they die ? animal rights organizations would like to make sure that nobody enjoys seeing such animals and learning about them from zoo visits , yet these visits are what pay for everything we do , from education through to conservation			1
over 1.5 billion visits will be made to @entity127 zoos during the @entity147 , with all of those visitors learning about nature			0
who would be there to offer nature conservation education if zoos did not exist ? zoos in reputable zoo associations worldwide are the fourth largest donors to conservation in the wild ; are animal rights groups going to replace the hundreds of millions of dollars that zoos currently donate ? no , because ultimately they do not care whether species have a future in the wild			1
we can not possibly release all of our animals back into a wild that is under siege , and which they would have to share with wild populations that are as large as their habitats can currently accommodate			0
who would carry out the @entity173 obligations which all @entity175 nations have signed up to ? would taxpayers really be willing to foot larger bills to pay for this , or would we , again , face abandoning animals and biodiversity to their fate , without any idea of the consequences this could bring ? @entity127 strongly believes that the humane and considered response is to make a real effort to save endangered species			0
we can not sit on the sidelines pretending that there is a magical solution to the crisis in nature , as animal rights groups do			1
serious problems require serious responses			0
as yet , anti-zoo activists have put forward no serious alternatives ; we would be interested to hear them , but we ca n't afford to wait			0

@entity202 under fire for culling healthy family of lions to make way for new animal
@entity215 zoo was criticized last month for killing a young giraffe
animals from all the world 's zoos can not be released into the wild , says @entity206
@entity223 : we can not pretending there is a magical solution to the crisis in nature
