-- after the blood letting and recriminations in the wake of @entity6 's doping confession , cycling continues to face questions over whether the sport is riding clean			1
the fall out from @entity6 's public confession sent shock waves through the sport and current @entity13 leader @entity12 has voiced his frustration at continued questions about doping			1
so much so that @entity17 gave @entity19 newspaper @entity18 data of 18 of @entity12 's climbs since he made his major breakthrough in 2011 , leaving the @entity19 newspaper 's sports science expert , @entity24 , satisfied the results were consistent with doping - free riding			2
@entity12 's teammate and reigning @entity13 champion , four - time olympic gold medalist and @entity31 of the @entity33 realm @entity34 insists the sport is on the path to a bright future			1
transparency the 33 - year - old 's place in cycling 's elite circle was cemented by his success in the sport 's showcase event 12 months ago , the first time a @entity40 has claimed the coveted crown			1
and though injury has robbed him of the chance to defend his title in 2013 , @entity48 thinks the sport is in rude health now the furore surrounding its shamed @entity58 star has begun to subside			1
" the thing with the whole @entity6 story is his confession was n't the tip of the iceberg where now all these other problems of the sport have now arisen , " @entity48 told @entity0 's @entity60 series , speaking ahead of the @entity13			1
" his problem was the final chapter of how the sport was 10 , 15 years ago			0
that can now be put to bed and we can focus now on what 's great about the sport now and the athletes we have			2
" i think that 's a great starting point for the future of the sport			1
" @entity6 was stripped of his seven @entity13 titles after admitting to persistent use of banned substances during his halcyon days at the sport 's lofty peak			1
@entity48 denies the supremacy of @entity17 in last year 's race -- that hinted they could dominate for years to come -- could propel other teams and riders towards the illicit substances that robbed @entity6 of his legacy			1
" i do n't think they 're thinking that , " he said			0
" i think we 're the role model , the template of how things are being done now			0
there 's no secret of how we 're doing it			0
we 're very transparent , very clear			0
" there 's been a lot of riders at this team that have left for other teams that know how it works here , so slowly that will get around and i do n't think people ( will ) revert back to that			0
" i think the sport is in such a strong position with the anti-doping , the biological passports , that it 's becoming harder and harder for people to go back to the old ways			2
" i think one of the things that stood out for me , with the whole @entity6 thing , was that he even said 10 , 15 years ago there was no out of competition testing			2
" it 's a daily thing with the whereabouts system , giving your whereabouts seven days of the week			0
it 's a completely different sport now and i think we 're leading the way as a sport for other sports to follow			2
" no matter what you 're doing , you 'll always get people that are cynical and are doubters			0
" but by continuing to do what we 're doing by answering these questions and putting ourselves out there to be shot at in time , it might take 15 years , i think we will gain credibility			0
" unfolding drama a measure of the strength in depth in the sport is evident even within @entity48 ' own @entity17 ranks			1
even if the 33 - year - old had been fit enough to take part in this year 's @entity13 , he would have been playing a supporting role to teammate and fellow countryman @entity12 , who finished second behind @entity48 in the @entity152 , but has dominated this year 's race			1
@entity48 has since stated he might not take part in @entity13 again , citing the sacrifices required as too demanding for him and his young family			1
but even if he does n't grace the roads of @entity19 again , @entity48 remains in no doubt as to the competition 's pedigree			1
" i think for a professional cyclist it 's the height of your sport , " he explained			1
" i 'm sat here now as the current winner of the @entity13 , sports personality in the @entity33 , sir @entity34 , and i 've got that because i won the @entity13			1
" people are in love with this sport and they 're in love with it because of the drama that unfolds each day -- the grit and determination people have to go through to win and i think that 's what inspires people			2
" it 's had a tainted history but i think all that is a reminder of where the sport was and where it is now			0
and it 's in a great position			0
" while its place in the pantheon of sporting theater is assured , @entity48 can attest to its attrition			0
for its legions of fans , watching elite athletes push the limits of endurance day after day is as captivating a sight as there is , but that does n't mean it is always fun to participate in			0
" it 's one thing racing the tour and being part of it and getting to @entity206 , " @entity48 said			2
" it 's another thing being up there , even wearing the jersey and being on telly every day and interviewed every day			0
" at the time it 's stressful , it 's maybe not enjoyable all the time			0
but when you look back , when you look at it , you think ' that was some experience really ' so it 's an incredible thing .			0
