-- one day , @entity1 wakes up and every single @entity2 has inexplicably disappeared			0
no business owner , doctor , nurse , soldier , teacher , entertainer , athlete or politician can be found			0
no bus driver , farm worker , cook , gardener or nanny			0
@entity1 -- the ninth largest economy in the world -- grinds to a halt because @entity19 have vanished			2
this scenario is what @entity24 's satiric film , " @entity23 , " explores			2
this modern - day fable provides a cautionary tale on the assumptions we make about the 11 million unauthorized immigrants who live and work in @entity32 every day			1
an oft - repeated mantra used to malign these " economic refugees " -- a term that more closely defines who they actually are , rather than the inflammatory " illegal immigrant " -- is that they do n't pay taxes			1
they send their kids to our schools , and they do n't pay taxes			1
they earn their wages , and they do n't pay income tax			2
such incendiary assertions are coded language designed explicitly to generate a negative reaction			0
the facts , which most people do n't know , refute such claims entirely			0
like everyone in the country , every time a refugee goes to a store and buys something , they pay sales tax			1
they buy milk ; they pay sales tax			2
they buy shoes ; they pay sales tax			2
they buy a television ; they pay sales tax			2
when refugees rent -- whether it 's in an apartment building , a room in a house or a house -- a portion of that rent is passed on to the landlord , who pays property tax to the state			2
president @entity86 's 1986 immigration reform law penalizes employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers			0
this policy has generated a black - market business for fake identity documents			0
in less than an hour you can obtain a fake green card , social security number and driver 's license			0
most refugees , then , do provide the necessary documents -- fake or otherwise -- to employers and when they get their paycheck , up to 15 % of their earnings goes to @entity102 to pay @entity103 and @entity104			1
but since it 's illegal for them to receive @entity103 and @entity104 benefits , this creates a windfall for @entity102			1
the " @entity113 , " used to track names and @entity103 numbers that do n't match government records , grew an average of $ 67 billion per year from 2000 to 2007 ( the most recent years for which data is available ) , three times faster than the file grew in the 1990s			1
in 2007 , $ 11.2 billion went into the @entity117 and $ 2.6 billion went into @entity104 , for a total that year of $ 13.8 billion			1
given the financial climate in @entity32 these past years , these are funds we can ill afford to do without			1
this week , in his testimony to the @entity124 , @entity125 , chief actuary of the @entity126 , said that because of the country 's growing aging population and decline in birth rates , the @entity128 fund reserves will be depleted by 2018 and the @entity117 will follow suit by 2036			0
@entity125 told the @entity134 recently that the windfall from economic refugees has saved the retirement system from insolvency			0
a similar phenomenon holds true on the state level			0
in december 2006 , @entity141 was the first state to conduct a comprehensive financial analysis of the impact of undocumented immigrants on a state 's budget and economy			1
the stunning results showed that " undocumented immigrants produced $ 1.58 billion in state revenues , which exceeded the $ 1.16 billion in state services they received			0
" @entity153 , the former @entity154 , said , " bottom line , undocumented immigrants in the state of @entity141 are adding $ 17.7 billion to our gross state product ... we net $ 428 million at the state level because of the taxes they 're paying in			1
" a few years ago , the @entity163 evaluated the impact of economic refugees on the budgets of state and local governments			0
it concluded , " over the past two decades , most efforts to estimate the fiscal impact of immigration in the @entity32 have concluded that , in aggregate and over the long term , tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants -- both legal and unauthorized -- exceed the cost of the services they use			1
" the film " @entity23 " was made in 2004			0
no @entity182 -- or @entity183 or @entity184 or @entity185 or @entity186 , for that matter -- have mysteriously disappeared from our country			0
in the long run , a day without @entity182 would deal a devastating blow not just to @entity1 , but to the @entity32 economy			1
it is time to cease the mantras that enforce the idea that illegal immigrants are nothing more than leeches to our society , and embrace the realities of what these people actually contribute to our economy : a financial fountain we would be foolish to shut off			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			2

@entity209 : not having illegal immigrants would be devastating blow to @entity32 economy
unauthorized immigrants pay taxes and contribute to @entity103 and @entity104
but since it 's illegal for them to receive those benefits , this creates a windfall for @entity102
@entity209 : it 's time to do away with the idea that illegal immigrants are leeches to our society
