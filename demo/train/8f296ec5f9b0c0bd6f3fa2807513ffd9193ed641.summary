@entity0 -- the @entity3 's decision monday on same - sex marriage brought the issue back into the political mix less than a month before the midterm elections			1
deciding not to weigh in on the debate , the high court refused to hear cases in five states that are trying to maintain their same - sex marriage bans			1
that move effectively cleared the way for same - sex couples to legally wed in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
only one of those five states , @entity19 , has a contested @entity25 race this year			0
but the decision monday also means that six other states who are covered by the same circuit appeals courts could also soon see their bans struck down			2
of those states , three -- @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 -- are home to big @entity25 races			0
all told , 30 states could soon start permitting same - sex marriage			1
that 's up from 19 before the @entity3 decision			1
polls show acceptance it 's instinctual to think that such a vast change on a hot - button issue could throw a wrench in an election year , especially with less than a month before @entity48			2
but recent polls and the gradual state - by - state legalization of same - sex marriage indicates that it 's no longer the wedge issue it once was			1
sure , vulnerable @entity54 -- like sen. @entity55 in @entity56 and @entity57 in @entity34 -- may be wary of letting social issues become a prominent force in the midterms , as they tend to galvanize conservative bases			0
but those socially conservative , pro-traditional marriage bases are getting smaller			0
a @entity65 / @entity64 survey last month indicated that 56 % of @entity66 believe same - sex marriage should be legal , representative of a slew of polls in recent years that show growing acceptance of the issue			1
" as a general rule , it wo n't have an effect on these midterms because i think the issue is fading , " said @entity74 , director of the @entity75 at @entity76 in @entity19			1
" millennials are becoming an increasingly larger portion of the electorate , and boomers are becoming an increasingly smaller part , " he continued			0
" and millennials feel very different about it than boomers do			0
" conservatives : issue will dominate election some social conservative leaders , including @entity93 of the @entity94 , vowed that same - sex marriage would dominate the midterms			1
" for candidates running in 2014 and those who run for president in 2016 , there will be no avoiding this issue , " @entity93 said in a statement , taking issue with what many critics described as judicial activism by the courts			2
while @entity107 chairman @entity106 said conservatives are right to be outraged by the courts ' action on the issue , he doubts same - sex marriage will become a big force in the elections next month			1
" people ... are right to be concerned about what 's happened here , but it does n't mean it 's the issue every single morning that we 're dealing with in regards to these midterms , " he said on @entity113			2
how it plays in @entity19 @entity107 @entity122 , who 's challenging @entity124 sen. @entity123 in @entity19 , said the @entity3 's decision has " considerable impact " but did not express overt concern about the issue			1
" i 've always felt that this is a matter for the states to determine , " he told @entity1 affiliate wsls			0
" i do n't believe that the federal government should set policy relative to marriage			2
i think the states should			0
and , obviously , given the court 's ruling , it is the law of the land today			0
" with half of @entity19 voters supporting same - sex marriage , according to a @entity144 poll earlier this year , a @entity107 candidate running for a statewide seat would almost need to take a measured approach on the issue			1
@entity123 , his opponent , endorsed same - sex marriage last year along with several other @entity147			1
on monday , his @entity149 account was fully supportive of the @entity3 's move , calling it a " truly historic day			1
" if a @entity107 like @entity122 were to utilize the decision as a campaign issue , the candidate would need to micro-target a segment of voters that is highly passionate about it , @entity74 said			2
" if he can link his passion against same - sex marriage with the right voters , then i think that can help him gain support , " @entity74 added , but he doubts it can actually push @entity122 over the edge			1
@entity32 candidates ' views in @entity32 , @entity168 @entity167 -- who 's angling to oust @entity124 sen. @entity169 -- has yet to comment on the @entity3 decision			1
the candidates were not asked about it in their debate monday			2
and with @entity32 voters supporting same - sex marriage , 61 % -33 % , according to a @entity144 poll in april , it 's no surprise that @entity167 may keep quiet on the issue			1
public opinion , however , makes it easier for @entity169 , who quickly took to @entity149 monday to blast out his support			0
" @entity3 is right to let 10th @entity183 decision â € ” & others across nation â € ” for # @entity186 stand			2
# @entity189 , " his account read			0
no comment in @entity34 over in @entity34 , where @entity168 @entity191 is working to unseat @entity124 sen. @entity57 in the most expensive race this year , neither candidate has commented on the decision			0
@entity57 was part of the surge of @entity147 who endorsed same - sex marriage last year , but @entity34 passed its same - sex marriage ban as recently as 2012 -- an effort that @entity191 , speaker of the @entity201 , helped push			1
according to the @entity202 , @entity57 reiterated her position monday			0
" i 've made my personal opinion on this clear , " she said			0
" i opposed @entity205 , because i do n't think we should tell people who they can love or who they can marry			0
" same in @entity33 the issue could also come up in @entity33 , another one of the six extra states affected			2
@entity212 sen. @entity212 , who supports a constitutional amendment to define marriage between a man and a woman , is fighting for his political survival against an independent candidate , @entity218			0
and in a state with large patches of conservative voters , neither of those candidates are commenting either			0
@entity1 's @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			0
