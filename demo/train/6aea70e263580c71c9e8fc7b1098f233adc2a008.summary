-- attorney general @entity1 called the leaks about @entity4 surveillance programs " extremely damaging " and vowed that the person responsible would be held accountable			1
appearing at a @entity4 - @entity7 ministerial meeting friday in @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity1 was asked by a reporter why the @entity4 has n't requested the arrest of @entity12 , the self - avowed @entity13 leaker			1
he is believed to be in @entity14 , and authorities are trying to keep track of his whereabouts			0
@entity18 has received an alert from the @entity20 urging it not to let @entity12 board a flight to the @entity23 , a representative for the airline in @entity26 said friday			1
in his remarks , @entity1 did n't mention @entity12 's name and said the case remains under investigation			1
@entity12 provided documents to journalists revealing the existence of secret programs to collect records of domestic telephone calls in the @entity4 and the internet activity of overseas residents			1
" the national security of the @entity4 has been damaged as a result those leaks			2
the safety of the @entity4 people and the safety of people who reside in allied nations have been put at risk as a result of these leaks , " @entity1 said			1
" we are presently in the process of that investigation , and i 'm confident the person who is responsible will be held accountable			2
" a glance at opinions about the @entity13 leaker the leaks have spurred great concern in @entity58			2
@entity7 officials in @entity8 raised questions , and @entity62 chancellor @entity61 told @entity0 in an interview that @entity58 officials are particularly concerned about the prism program -- the secret set of tools used to collect data about overseas internet communications			1
the @entity13 and @entity70 have obtained massive numbers of @entity4 phone logs through a court order			0
@entity61 intends to discuss the prism surveillance program with president @entity76 , she told @entity0 in @entity77 on friday			1
she wants the greatest possible transparency on all these issues , she said			0
the @entity7 has " serious concerns " about the reported large - scale surveillance of online data by @entity4 authorities , @entity81 vice president @entity80 said			2
@entity1 discussed the leak about @entity87 turning over details of phone calls			1
the @entity76 administration invoked the @entity92 's @entity91 -- as well as the @entity93 -- as the basis for a secret court order demanding @entity87 records that show originating and terminating phone numbers , their location , time and duration			1
that information , called telephony metadata , requires a court order			0
@entity1 explained that the surveillance programs are overseen by courts , strictly monitored and focused on wrongdoing such as terrorism			1
he said the program does not allow the government to listen in on anyone 's phone calls and the information required does n't include " the content of any communication or the identity of any subscriber			2
" " the court only allows that data to be queried when there is a reasonable suspicion based on specific facts that the particular basis for the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organization , " he said			0
" only special cleared counter-terrorism personnel who are specifically trained in the court - approved procedures may even access those records			0
all information that is required under this order is subject to strict restrictions on handling and is overseen by the @entity132 and the @entity93 court			0
and only a very small fraction of the records are ever reviewed because the vast majority of the data is not responsive to any terrorism - related query that might be posed , " he said			0
@entity1 was referring to the @entity140			1
as for @entity141 , he said the program " facilitates the targeted acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning foreign targets located outside the @entity4 under again court oversight			1
" he stressed that the program is subject to extensive " internal and external " oversight			2
" the government can not target anyone under the court - approved procedures for this program unless there is an appropriate and documented foreign intelligence purpose for the acquisition , such as for the prevention of terrorism , hostile cyber activities or nuclear proliferation , " he said			2
" the foreign target is reasonably believed to be outside the @entity4			0
we can not target even foreign persons overseas without a valid foreign intelligence purpose			0
" intercepted data called critical in terror investigations @entity12 went public about @entity13 surveillance programs sunday in an interview with the @entity23 newspaper @entity169			1
as an employee of @entity171 , a contractor for the @entity4 electronic intelligence agency , he had been working at an @entity13 facility in @entity174 and had worked for the @entity175 in the past			0
he provided fresh fuel wednesday for the controversy he has sparked , telling a @entity14 newspaper that @entity4 intelligence agents have been hacking networks around the world for years , including hundreds of computers in @entity184			0
@entity184 quiet about @entity12 as for @entity12 's whereabouts , the @entity18 representative has not seen the alert and could not offer any other details			1
the @entity20 declined earlier to comment on reports that it was asking airlines not to let @entity12 board flights to the @entity23			1
@entity193 also declined to comment			0
@entity184 has remained tight - lipped about its stance on @entity12 , who is believed to be holed up in a safe house somewhere in the semiautonomous territory of @entity14			1
in an interview with the @entity198 , he also said he planned to stay in @entity14 to fight any attempt to force him to return to the @entity4 because he has " faith in @entity14 's rule of law			0
" his comments come as the @entity70 is investigating his case			0
@entity184 internet users call on government to ' protect ' @entity12 his presence in the southern @entity184 territory , which has a separate system of government from the mainland , has raised questions about how an effort by the @entity4 government to extradite him would unfold and what role @entity213 might play in the process			1
" we have no information to offer at the moment , " a spokeswoman for the @entity217 , @entity216 , said in response to a question about @entity12 at a regular news briefing in @entity213 on thursday			1
she repeated the same answer to several follow - up questions			0
there are " no signs or indications " that @entity12 had accomplices or tried to sell secrets , a @entity4 official said			1
investigators think the leaker is still in @entity14 and have a general sense of where he is in that @entity237 metropolis			0
@entity12 's case has become a hot issue in that coastal city , making local newspaper front pages , stirring legal debates and prompting plans for a rally in support of him over the weekend			1
progressive group fundraises for @entity13 leaker 's legal defense the reaction in mainland @entity184 , on the other hand , has been muted			0
state - run media outlets have covered the case cautiously , appearing to try to avoid focusing too much attention on some of the sensitive issues his disclosures have raised , such as government surveillance of citizens			2
the @entity12 story has also so far failed to make big waves among @entity184 's tens of millions of highly active social media users			1
some @entity184 state media have taken the opportunity to highlight @entity12 's comments to the @entity198 alleging that the @entity4 government has hacked @entity184 targets			1
in recent years , the @entity269 newspaper said in an editorial , " the @entity4 has always claimed itself to be a victim of @entity184 hacking activities			0
many speculate that it 's a coverup for hacking activities conducted by the @entity4 government			0
now , @entity12 's revelation proves that such activities have already been going on for a long time			2
" among some 61,000 reported targets of the @entity13 , @entity12 told the @entity14 newspaper , are hundreds of computers in @entity184			2
@entity4 officials have increasingly accused @entity184 of being the source of thousands of attacks on @entity4 military and commercial networks			0
@entity213 has denied such attacks			0
the @entity198 said it had seen documents provided by @entity12 but was unable to verify their authenticity			2
the newspaper also said it was unable to independently verify allegations of @entity4 hacking of networks in @entity14 and mainland @entity184 since 2009			0
@entity12 told the paper that some of the targets included the @entity298 , public officials and students			1
the documents also " point to hacking activity by the @entity13 against mainland targets , " it reported			0
the claims came just days after @entity76 pressed @entity184 president @entity307 to address cyberattacks emanating from @entity184 that @entity76 described as " direct theft of @entity4 property			2
" @entity0 's @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 and @entity314 contributed to this report .			0
