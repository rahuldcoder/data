@entity0 -- he is @entity3 's most outspoken critic			1
but when he won his freedom after three months in prison , it came with a cost -- that he keep quiet			0
one day after @entity9 was released on bail , the dissident artist remained at home , unable to speak with anyone about why he was detained or what awaits him now			1
all he was able to tell reporters was that he was all right			2
the terms of his bail stipulated that he not talk to the media			1
" and he has reached an agreement with the authorities and that agreement is that he will not say anything about what happened during the 80 days that he was held incommunicado and also that he will desist from any advocacy of the rule of law , human rights or criticism of the government , " said @entity20 of @entity21 , @entity9 's release came without much fanfare			1

he managed a smile but declined to answer questions			0
" i 'm fine , " he said			0
" i 'm sorry i can not talk			0
i am on probation , please understand			0
" it was not a customary answer from the provocative conceptual artist , renowned as a harsh , uncompromising critic of @entity3 government policies			1
he 's most famous for designing the @entity54 for the @entity55			0
but later @entity9 called for a boycott of the games because he said @entity3 was using them as propaganda			1
he also has accused the @entity3 government of trying to silence dissidents			1
@entity9 was seized april 3 while planning to board a plane to @entity63 and later accused of economic crimes , a move that prompted international condemnation and added to criticism over @entity3 's controversial record on human rights			1
he was never formally charged or tried			0
@entity9 's @entity0 studio was raided , and his wife and eight assistants were taken into custody for questioning			1
@entity0 police accused him of evading a " huge amount " of taxes , @entity36 reported in may , more than a month after he was detained			0
investigators accused @entity9 's company of intentionally destroying accounting documents			1
his prolonged detention sparked international outcry , especially among artists and museum officials in the @entity84 and @entity85			0
he became a rallying point among human rights activists overseas who condemned @entity3 's crackdown on political dissidents , lawyers , artists and religious groups			1
observers in @entity0 said it may not be coincidental that @entity9 's release on wednesday took place on the eve of premier @entity100 's upcoming visit to @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , where @entity9 enjoys wide support among artists and politicians			1
the news came after more than 140,000 people in 175 nations joined a campaign spearheaded by @entity111 that urged the artist 's immediate release			0
leading art institutions including the @entity115 , the @entity116 , @entity118 's @entity117 and the @entity119 were part of the campaign			0
fellow activist @entity121 cheered @entity9 's release , but expressed concern about the current situation , especially the ongoing crackdown on dissent			1
on @entity3 's cyberspace , @entity9 's name is nowhere to be found , censored out of existence			1
even words with the slightest connection to @entity9 -- @entity9 , or " the fat guy " -- are blocked , too			2
some @entity3 netizens tried to camouflage their postings			2
" the man whose name can not be mentioned is released ! " read one post			0
international reporting on @entity9 , including on @entity1 , was blacked out			2
@entity3 's mainstream press has largely downplayed @entity9 's release ; most newspapers ignored it			1
@entity9 will not be on @entity142 , @entity143 or on television			2
under bail conditions , he has lost his freedom of speech , said @entity147 , adjunct senior fellow for @entity149 studies at the @entity150			2
" he 's got to keep quiet and behave according to the criteria of the @entity3 police for the foreseeable future , " @entity147 said			2
" he 's not the only one			0
this has happened many times before , " said @entity147 , also a professor at @entity155			0
@entity0 police told state media that @entity9 had been released on bail because of his good attitude in confessing his alleged crimes and also said he was suffering from a chronic disease			1
it is not clear to what disease police were referring			0
@entity9 has also said that he is willing to pay the taxes he allegedly evaded , police told @entity36			2
relatives and human rights groups said they believe @entity3 authorities targeted him because of his irreverent commentary on modern @entity3 society , though the @entity3 government denied his activism had anything to do with his detention			1
" he is not alone in this position and in fact shares it with many human rights lawyers , writers , activists and young people online , " filmmaker @entity178 recently told @entity1			0
" a lot of the censorship that happens in @entity3 is self - censorship , and i think the fact that @entity9 does n't engage in self - censorship is a big reason why people gravitate to him , " said @entity178 , whose feature film " @entity9 : never sorry " is set to be released this fall			1
but for now , @entity9 will have to be silent			2
@entity1 's @entity195 contributed to this report .			0
