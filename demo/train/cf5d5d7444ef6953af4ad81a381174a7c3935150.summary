-- if you 're trying to lose weight , close your eyes for a minute and imagine the moments that make you fat			0
think through your day , and you 'll see them , as big and obvious as a hot fudge sundae sitting right in front of you			0
you 've been good all day , and wham , your friends suggest you go to a buffet for dinner ; or you 've diligently worked out and wham , you end up at a cocktail party with an array of the most killer desserts ever			1
do n't rely on your willpower to get you through these tough times , advises @entity16 , executive director of the @entity17 at the @entity18			1
" willpower is not inexhaustible , " he says			1
" you only have a certain amount of it , and it 's gone			0
" the key is to accept the fact that your willpower will run out at some point , and plan strategies to get you through fattening situations			2
here are the top five moments that make you fat , and what you can do to outwit them			0
on vacation the problem : you 're on vacation and you want to kick back , relax , and enjoy the local cuisine -- but you do n't want to come home with pounds to shed			1
the solution : " go for it , " advises @entity39 , a registered dietitian and senior food and nutrition editor at @entity41			0
if you 're in @entity44 , for example , do n't skip a visit to the bakery -- that would be tres triste -- but share the goodies with friends			1
after a break - up the problem : you want to bury your sorrows in a pint of ice cream			1
the solution : " instead of meeting your friend for a drink to dish about your ex , meet up for a power walk or run , " @entity39 advises			1
also , sign up for a team that is training for a @entity64 or some other race to distract your self and meet new people			1
a party with fabulous food the problem : you 're at a party and everything looks delicious			0
it 's free , it 's in front of you , and no one 's stopping you			0
the solution : do n't arrive famished , says dr. @entity78 , @entity81 's diet and fitness expert			1
eat a small protein snack before the party , such as a few slices of turkey , a half a cup of low - fat cottage cheese , or half a protein bar			2
also , limit your alcohol , and not just because it 's caloric , but because if it 's hard to control yourself while you 're sober , imagine how much harder it is while tipsy			0
watching tv the problem : you want to plop in front of the television with a high - fat snack			2
the solution : use a small bowl , @entity39 says , or snack on frozen grapes or veggies with a yogurt - based dip			2
at a buffet , or a restaurant with enormous portions the problem : buffets offer limitless amounts of food , and much of it has tons of calories			1
restaurants with big portions of delicious foods make it hard to push the plate away			0
the solution : simply do n't go to buffet restaurants , @entity16 advises			2
but if you really have to , sit at a table where you can face away from the buffet -- @entity78 says studies show people who face away tend to eat less -- and load up initially on fruits , vegetables , and lean proteins so ( at least hopefully ) you wo n't have enough room for the bad stuff			1
at the end of the meal , she suggests having everyone at the table get just one dessert and share , so you get a little taste of lots of things			0
as for big portion restaurants , the trick is to get the doggy bag at the front end , not the back end			0
@entity16 suggests when you order your meal , ask for half of your dinner to be brought to you on a plate , and the other half in a to - go box .			0

do n't rely on your willpower to get you through tough times , expert says
@entity159 break - up , meet friends for a power walk or join a @entity64 team to meet people
sharing treats on vacation or at a restaurant limits calories
