-- after a multi-year odyssey marked by almost nonstop partisan bickering , @entity3 employees hacking into @entity5 computers , and former @entity7 administration officials launching a pre-emptive public counterattack against the committee 's report , we finally have a summary of the @entity3 's use of torture			1
so what have we learned ? the committee report confirms that six days after the 9/11 attacks , " president @entity7 signed a covert action @entity19 ( @entity20 ) to authorize the director of central intelligence ( @entity21 ) to ' undertake operations designed to capture and detain persons who pose a continuing , serious threat of violence or death to @entity29 persons and interest or who are planning terrorist activities			2
' " that decision put the @entity3 on the path to revive and even expand coercive interrogation techniques it had employed during the @entity37			0
some key facts we already knew were confirmed , most importantly that agency personnel violated @entity29 and international law by repeatedly waterboarding several detainees , including 9/11 attack mastermind @entity43			1
the summary of the report provides lurid details of " 24 " - like interrogation techniques , outlawed by international treaties to which the @entity29 is a signatory : running power drills next to the heads of detainees , days of forced sleep deprivation and , in the words of the committee summary , " threats to harm the children of a detainee , threats to sexually abuse the mother of a detainee , and a threat to ' cut ( a detainee 's ) mother 's throat			1
' " the committee report summary also confirms what many have long believed -- that the torture program produced no actionable intelligence and did not to thwart @entity71 's global activities			0
the former chief of the @entity3 's @entity73 and torture program participant @entity72 continues to claim that such intelligence was obtained , and that it did in fact save lives			2
the available record , as laid out by the committee , amply refutes that assertion			0
and the committee summary could not be clearer about the actions of agency managers and attorneys in the expansion of the use of techniques that were clear violations of international law			1
according to the committee summary : " ... by the end of november 2001 , @entity3 officers had begun researching potential legal defenses for using interrogation techniques that were considered torture by foreign governments and a non-governmental organization			1
" cia director @entity97 subsequently sent a letter to @entity7 urging that the @entity3 program be exempt from @entity101 prohibitions on the use of techniques defined by international law as torture			1
whether as federal employees or political appointees , @entity3 personnel took an oath to uphold the laws of the @entity29			2
instead , they chose to engage in acts that clearly violated those laws , including international treaties banning the use of torture to which the @entity29 is not only a signatory , but a putative leader as well			1
the response of multiple former intelligence community insiders who authorized or supported these programs is perfectly summed up in this quote from an anonymous former official offered to the @entity120 earlier this week : " it goes back to the one basic thing : whether they did right or they did wrong , they were told to do something , they did it , and they feel like they had the rug pulled out from underneath them			0
" indeed , those @entity3 attorneys and managers who signed off on waterboarding and other tactics had an affirmative obligation to refuse to authorize , much less participate in , a torture program			0
now , through de facto surrogates appearing on major media outlets and operating a website attempting to rewrite the history of this dark era , participants in the torture program claim they are the victims for simply following orders			0
the defense of " i was just following orders " is never a winning one			0
the use of mass surveillance and torture are the hallmarks of totalitarian governments			1
the @entity29 has employed both since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on our nation			0
while we have yet to renounce the former , the release of this @entity5 torture report summary is a long - overdue first step in renouncing the latter			2
let 's hope it 's not the last step .			0
