-- the revelation that @entity3 leader @entity2 hid in " plain sight " at a house in a bastion of @entity8 military power has touched a nerve in the @entity10 , which relies heavily on the @entity12 government in its grinding war against terrorism			1
many @entity16 administration officials , lawmakers and observers from across the political spectrum want to know how @entity2 -- based at a compound in the military garrison city of @entity23 -- could have eluded @entity8 capture , or whether the government or elements of it harbored @entity2			1
live blog : up - to - the - minute developments they want to know whether @entity8 is firmly backing the fight against terror or is supportive of militants fighting against troops in @entity34			2
the @entity10 has a " complicated but important relationship " with @entity8 , @entity36 press secretary @entity35 said tuesday			1
@entity35 told reporters that @entity10 officials need to learn more about the " support network " that sustained @entity2 in @entity8			1
but he also warned against " tarring " everyone in @entity8 's government because of the revelation that @entity2 had been living so close to @entity12			1
there has also been " a great deal of important cooperation " in the fight against @entity49 extremism , he said			0
" the idea that these kinds of complications exist is not new			0
" but rep. @entity53 , the @entity55 @entity54 who is chairman of the @entity57 , said " this ca n't be allowed to go on			1
" in comments tuesday at a @entity36 subcommittee hearing on @entity8 , @entity53 noted that @entity2 's compound was near a headquarters for the @entity8 intelligence services			1
@entity36 : @entity2 unarmed when shot " there are two possibilities and one answer , " @entity53 said			1
" one is that it was a direct facilitation by elements of the @entity8 government , or @entity8 intelligence is entirely inept , and that has not proven to be the case over the years			2
" at the hearing , @entity73 of the @entity74 told the panel that @entity2 's presence in @entity8 showed that " at the very least , there has not been a high priority in targeting senior @entity3 leaders " in the country			1
" based on the threat streams coming from this area , those interests have to change in my view , " @entity73 said			0
another terrorism expert , @entity86 of the @entity87 , said mistrust between the @entity10 and @entity8 runs both ways , with @entity8 officials fearful that the @entity10 will abandon the region after eliminating @entity2			1
sources : @entity93 comes down hard on @entity8 " it is essential that we find ways not only to communicate our frustration to @entity8 , " @entity86 said , but also to say " we 're not leaving			0
" the @entity10 has regarded @entity8 as a top ally in the fight against the @entity100 , @entity3 , the @entity101 and other @entity8 - based militants who have launched attacks against internationaland @entity34 troops in @entity34			1
at tuesday 's hearing , experts also identified @entity107 as a major emerging threat from @entity8 to the @entity110 subcontinent and beyond			1
@entity8 's president defends his nation according to the @entity115 , the @entity10 has provided $ 18 billion in foreign assistance and reimbursements to @entity8 , two - thirds of which are security - related			1
the administration and lawmakers have praised the @entity8 for their anti-terrorism efforts , but at the same time some lawmakers suspect the country has n't been robust enough in going after terrorists			0
some say elements of @entity8 's intelligence services -- the @entity127 or @entity127 -- have close ties with militants			1
sen. @entity130 , the @entity132 @entity131 and chairwoman of the @entity134 , agrees that they have been " good at going after some terrorists " but have " very subtly walked both sides of the street			0
" " that 's of concern to many of us , i think , because you have to declare yourself , " she told reporters , noting that the issue of @entity8 will be addressed by the committee			2
@entity147 , who is president @entity16 's deputy national security adviser , told @entity0 that despite legitimate questions about what @entity8 authorities knew , the @entity10 needed to maintain the relationship			1
" we obviously recognize that nobody has sacrificed more in this war against @entity3 than the @entity8 , " @entity147 said			0
" @entity3 had declared war , in fact , on the @entity8 government , have threatened and continues to threaten to try to get their hands on nuclear material in that country			0
... so they obviously have a lot at stake in this fight			0
so we 're going to continue to work with them and continue to try to partner with them against @entity3 , because we recognize that it 's not only in our interests , but in their interests			0
" retired @entity173 officer : can @entity10 trust @entity8 ? asked if the @entity10 funding to @entity8 should continue , @entity147 said such investments bolster @entity10 security			1
" we 'll continue to try to work with them to train , to try to target the common threat that we face from @entity3 , " @entity147 said , adding : " nobody has greater concern about our ability to ... carry out the fight against @entity3 than the president			0
we 're going to continue to do that , either with our @entity8 friends or alone			0
but this is too big a fight for us to give it up			0
" @entity147 also said he agreed with a reported quote by @entity173 director @entity93 that the @entity10 decided not to share intelligence with @entity8 in the run - up to the monday raid that led to @entity2 's death because of fears of a leak			1
sen. @entity195 , the top @entity54 on the @entity196 , also cited concern that some @entity8 officials might alert @entity2			1
" this is one reason we did not inform the @entity8 of our actions , " @entity195 said , while noting " there were probably many who were very uncomfortable about the presence likewise			2
" the @entity8 government on tuesday " categorically " denied reports that its leadership " had any prior knowledge " of the @entity10 operation against @entity2 one @entity127 official denied any complicity in hiding @entity2 , saying one failure and embarrassment does n't negate its " track record " of capturing more @entity3 members than anyone else			1
" yes , we did fail to locate him			0
yes , we are embarrassed			0
but that does not mean we are incompetent and straddling the fence , " the official said			0
" had we known that @entity2 was there we would have raided it and handed him over to the @entity10 to silence the critics talking about the complicity of the @entity127			1
" the @entity10 is reviewing intelligence seized in the compound to determine whether @entity2 received support inside @entity8 , a senior @entity10 official told @entity0			1
this comes amid discussions in @entity229 over the extent of the @entity8 intelligence service 's knowledge of his whereabouts and whether it provided him sanctuary			2
@entity195 was asked in @entity229 why taxpayers should support money for @entity8			0
" it 's a very complex country			0
a very complex set of officials , " the @entity240 senator said			0
" to try to obtain perfection in terms of who the recipients ought to be is out of the question			0
it 's a question of if there are goals we can achieve if we have some accountability of the money			0
" former secretary of state @entity254 told @entity0 on tuesday that @entity8 has been an " important partner in counterterrorism cooperation and we 've had very important cooperation from them			0
" @entity260 raises concerns about @entity8 but she questions how @entity2 could " hide in plain sight in that kind of compound without the knowledge of high - ranking officials			1
" " we have captured many , many @entity3 operatives in @entity8 , including @entity273 , so @entity8 has been a cooperating counterterrorism partner , " @entity260 said , making reference to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks			2
" but everyone knows that there are elements within @entity8 that are still tied to extremism , that has been a concern , and it is very important now that the @entity8 take a hard look at how this possibly could have happened , " @entity282 , director of the @entity283 at the @entity284 and an expert on @entity8 , said there have been strong differences between @entity229 and @entity12 over @entity10 drone strikes in the tribal region and calls to remove @entity173 operatives in the country			1
the @entity2 operation and the issues surrounding it add to the tension , he said			0
" i would not be surprised if there are questions on @entity298 about continued level of support to @entity8 , about the @entity10 relationship with @entity8 and the consideration of the nature of that relationship and how we handle it going forward , " he said			1
the @entity8 government and the @entity127 supported the @entity100 when it controlled @entity34 during the 1990s , but the government broke ties with the @entity100 after the 9/11 attacks			2
@entity10 officials have consistently indicated that there are rogue @entity127 elements supportive of militants			2
one reason @entity8 also have supported militants in the tribal region is that the fighters are seen as serving as a bulwark for @entity8 interests			2
that includes a focus against the influence of longtime rival @entity110 in @entity34 , @entity282 said			2
" the @entity8 are hedging their bets , " he said			0
" they know the @entity10 is n't there to stay			0
" @entity325 : " the quiet professionals " @entity327 , executive vice president of the @entity328 , said the onus will be on @entity8 to do a thorough investigation to assess what happened with @entity2			2
" if @entity8 denies any official involvement with @entity2 , it will be difficult to prevent a backlash among members of the @entity335 who will believe that @entity8 is playing a double game , " @entity327 said			1
@entity327 also says @entity8 's fear is that @entity110 will increase influence in @entity34 and surround @entity8 , and that calculation has led @entity8 to keep militants under its sway			1
@entity342 , a @entity343 @entity54 who is chairman of the @entity345 , said @entity8 and the @entity10 have " a very funny relationship			2
" @entity8 dispatched " troops into the tribal areas at our request " and " took thousands and thousands of casualties trying to fight @entity100 and @entity3 elements , " @entity342 said on @entity0 's " @entity354			2
" " there are some concerns about their isi being penetrated , their intelligence services being penetrated , but at the same time , " he said , " we 've got to have them			0
" @entity0 's @entity359 , @entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 and @entity364 contributed to this report			0

new : rep. @entity53 says elements in @entity8 had to know of @entity2 's presence
observers think @entity8 is playing both sides of the fence
@entity8 has gotten billions in @entity10 aid since 9/11
@entity12 's fear over @entity110 influence motivates ties with militants , *analysts* say
