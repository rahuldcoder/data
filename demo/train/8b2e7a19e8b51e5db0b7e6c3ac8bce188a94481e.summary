-- the rev. @entity3 's words , written in april 1963 from a jail cell in @entity5 , @entity6 , ring as true today as they did then : " injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere			1
we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality , tied in a single garment of destiny			2
whatever affects one directly , affects all indirectly			2
" this is a profound part of the testimony of black history in @entity20			1
what @entity3 knew was that the fullest potential of our nation will never be achieved until all @entity20 have the ability to access the freedom , justice and equality that we so proudly proclaim			1
i am keenly aware that it was the courage of countless @entity20 confronting the bigotry , disadvantage and institutional biases of the past that blazed a trail allowing my family to thrive			1
my ancestors worked hard and sacrificed for their success , yet , but for the collective struggle of those dedicated to a more just and inclusive @entity20 , they would not have succeeded			1
sen. @entity43 : i have lived the power of the @entity45 this generation can never fully repay those who struggled to build a better @entity20 -- the names and faces at the center of @entity50 who changed the course of our collective @entity20 history			1
but we can honor them by paying it forward , by working to create tides that lift more boats			2
because we remain a country falling short of its highest ideals			1
there is work to do			2
we can all do better , achieve more as a nation , if we dedicate ourselves to continuing to address our persistently painful inequality of opportunity and justice			2
for example , in health care and education we have made much progress , but racial disparities and cyclical poverty highlight our nation 's unfinished business			1
and it 's a reality that hurts all @entity20			1
black patients overall receive a lower quality of care than white patients			0
african - americans are far more likely than white @entity20 to use hospitals or clinics as their primary source of care , and about 20 % of african - americans lack any consistent source of health care			1
meanwhile , only 54 % of african - americans graduate from high school , compared with more than three quarters of white and @entity94 students			0
so what do we do to fix this ? the @entity97 is clearly an important step in providing affordable , quality health care for all @entity20 -- a step that prioritizes lifesaving preventive care			1
we need to make smarter investments in our schools , and that includes investing where it can make the most difference -- by providing every child with access to a high - quality pre-k program			0
closing the classroom achievement gap also means acknowledging that education starts in the home			0
providing for better health and better education is a powerful way to break the momentum of poverty , allowing people to reach their potential			2
and if we want to do more , we have to strengthen families			0
that , of course , means advancing initiatives such as paid family leave , so parents do n't have to choose between taking care of a sick child or parent and keeping their job			0
it also means doing more to help first - time , at - risk moms through proven programs that provide them and their children with home nurse care			0
but we also must acknowledge that one of the most important determinants of social mobility and achievement is whether or not a child comes from a two - parent household			0
clearly , we need to be doing more to support single parents , but there are also strategies to encourage parents to stay to together			0
reforming @entity20 's broken criminal justice system is near the top of the list			1
as the former mayor of @entity151 , i witnessed countless families torn apart when one parent went to jail for a nonviolent drug offense			0
that incarceration kicked off a chain reaction of events that impacted not only the person incarcerated , but their entire family : divorce , long - term joblessness and poverty			2
our failed criminal justice system has become our country 's greatest civil rights and civil liberties challenge			1
the @entity20 incarcerates a greater percentage of its population than any other nation in the world , and the corrections system costs taxpayers about $ 70 billion a year			1
and again , we see the black community suffering more than other groups : @entity178 - @entity20 offenders on average receive sentences 10 % longer than white offenders for the same crimes , and they are 20 % more likely to be sentenced to prison			1
more than 60 % of the prison population is comprised of racial and ethnic minorities			2
we need to think creatively about how to fix problems , not just lock people up and look the other way , hoping for a different outcome			0
we need to think differently about why we punish , how we punish and for how long we punish			0
we need to think about how to keep families together , make communities safer and save taxpayer dollars			0
when faced with this array of problems , it is easy to despair			0
but i am filled with hope , and , particularly during @entity50 , draw inspiration from those who tackled and overcame the challenges of the past			0
yes , challenges still exist , even as we celebrate how far we 've come			0
the question now is , how will we meet them ? the answer to that question will ultimately define this generation 's legacy			2
let 's rise to this challenge			1
the future success of our nation depends upon us resolving to carry on the struggle that has brought us this far			0
