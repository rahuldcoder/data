very little in life is truly inevitable			0
when briefing policy makers , i would try to point out that a lot of it was n't even predictable ( at least in any scientific sense )			0
but surely what is happening in @entity9 , the increasingly darkening clouds of sectarian division , can hardly be described as unexpected			1
in late 2006 , as the @entity12 administration was debating the so - called surge , there were few doubts that five brigades worth of professional combat power could buy down the hellish level of violence then inflicting that country			0
there was less certainty that even with a reduced level of violence the @entity9 government could leverage that reality to make meaningful political progress			1
at one meeting i pointed out that to do so prime minister @entity29 would have to " govern beyond his life experience			1
" having lived for an extensive period in exile , fearing for his life and seeing @entity35 bent on his murder at every turn , he was far from a sure bet to be the kind of visionary , inclusive leader that we all thought @entity9 needed			1
the @entity44 - dominated @entity9 military and police services were also problematic , as strengthening them without the necessary political development threatened to make what @entity47 and @entity48 saw as a predatory force simply more effective in their predations			1
aware of these dangers , along with the surge , the @entity12 administration spared no energy in working to coax , coach and mentor @entity29 into a broader approach toward governance			0
in addition to the tireless efforts of two talented ambassadors -- @entity62 and @entity63 -- private , secure video conferences between the @entity66 president and @entity9 prime minister were routine			1
60 killed in @entity9 bombings the substantial @entity66 military presence and its large training mission were also used to prod the @entity9 military along the path of nonsectarian professionalism			1
so important was this presence that sustaining it by concluding a @entity79 ( the rules governing how foreign troops may operate in a nation ) became a near obsession of the administration			1
even with that effort , the most that the traffic would bear was an extension through the end of 2011 although both parties knew that it could be subject to renewal			0
that was always going to be difficult ; we knew it would be impossible without a president willing to invest significant political capital -- domestically and internationally -- to achieve it			0
with that agreement unextended and now expired , @entity29 appears to be acting out the darkest shadows of his own past			0
over the last months , he has reneged on a power - sharing agreement with @entity47 in several key ministries , arrested hundreds of suspected @entity35 ( read @entity47 oppositionists ) and -- as the last @entity66 troops were leaving @entity9 and fresh from an audience in the @entity102 -- he has now ordered the arrest of his own @entity47 vice president , @entity104 , for alleged " terrorism			1
" along with all of this , @entity106 in @entity9 greeted the @entity66 withdrawal with a series of deadly bombings against largely @entity44 targets			1
@entity106 was always expected to take advantage of the " seam " created by the handoff of counterterrorism operations from @entity66 to @entity9 control , but now even a badly weakened @entity106 can exploit the sense of @entity47 vulnerability that @entity29 's actions have created			1
the situation may yet be salvaged			0
@entity66 is not without tools			2
ambassador @entity122 cut short his holiday home leave to return to @entity9 and , as he has in the past , he will no doubt use his considerable skills in an attempt to defuse the situation			2
but the ambassador will have fewer tools at his disposal			0
president @entity129 has consistently characterized the withdrawal as a " promise kept , " adding that " it 's time to turn the page			0
" for nearly a year , we witnessed the oddity of a president sticking to his campaign promise while parts of his government , particularly in the @entity140 , worked to extend the @entity66 presence			1
at @entity143 , @entity144 , however , the president brought down the curtain , telling the assembled soldiers that @entity9 's future now was " in the hands of its people			2
@entity66 's war in @entity9 will be over			1
" but in other , similar circumstances we have found a continued military presence to be invaluable , not for continued war making but to foster local progress and regional stability			0
whatever the withdrawal means in purely physical terms in @entity9 , the psychic impact there and in the region is that @entity66 is less interested			1
in @entity9 that means that each of the factions are going to their sectarian corners and are preparing to come out fighting			1
@entity165 of the @entity166 points to @entity167 ( itself a controversial intervention ) as a model where a continued @entity66 presence helps deter old protagonists from resuming shooting at one another			1
in @entity174 , history may judge that -- beyond the obvious defense value of @entity66 forces -- they also nurtured the development of @entity181 democracy by retarding what would have been an even greater militarization of @entity181 society had they been absent			2
and in @entity188 , a @entity66 footprint there says that the continent 's importance to us is beyond rhetoric			2
clearly @entity66 military deployments can not be governed by a principle of " once in , in forever			2
" to put it bluntly , training wheels have to come off sometime			0
but in this case they may have come off based on something other than the needs or talents of the cyclist			0
the @entity203 has made efforts to downplay recent events in @entity9 : certainly bad , but things we have seen before , and we expect that the @entity9 will muddle through			2
@entity203 spokesman @entity208 summarized it this way : " this kind of political turmoil has been occurring in @entity9 periodically , as they have taken steps forward and , occasionally , steps backward , but generally made progress			2
" that is not inevitable			0
i would hesitate to predict it			0
i certainly would not casually base my policy on that expectation .			0

*ex-cia* *director* @entity222 : the sectarian strife in @entity9 was predictable
he says the background of the nation and prime minister set stage for tension and violence
presence of @entity66 troops has calmed danger *zones* around the world , he says
@entity222 : withdrawing troops may have fulfilled campaign promise , but move was too risky
