@entity0 , @entity1 -- along the road in the semi-autonomous @entity1 region of @entity6 frozen oil bleeds out of the rock face			1
for @entity9 , ceo of the independent oil and gas exploration and production company @entity10 , it was an irresistible lure at the time few were daring to invest in @entity6			1
but not all is well in @entity6 and old arguments with @entity15 over oil power and revenue are likely to loom large as @entity19 forces withdraw from the country			1
@entity9 says @entity6 offers opportunity			2
" to be able to compete with majors we have to be able to go places and do things and try to find opportunities that are unconventional , " he says			0
" after that first visit , i never looked back			0
after visiting @entity6 in june of 2006 and literally seeing oil running down rocks at a road cut , i was just fascinated			1
i had to be here and i had to participate			0
" at the site where it all began , @entity34 1 , drill manager @entity32 remembers the day they realized they had hit it big			0
" as we carried on the drilling process it was one of those things where i use to say to @entity9 or send an email everyday with an operational update that we have a big problem			0
we just can not stop finding oil			0
" initially they had estimated the @entity34 field held about a billion barrels of oil			1
" it 's turned out to be something that we never would have dreamed , that it would be this size			0
it 's now an oil field of 8 - 13.5 billion barrels and that 's one of the largest oil fields covered in this part of the world in history , " @entity9 says			1
the risk he took turned out to be well worth the reward			0
" our market capital was 45 million pounds ( about $ 70 million ) in august of 2009			0
our market cap right now is 1.6 billion pounds as a result of the @entity34 discovery			0
" others have been just as intoxicated by the potential that @entity6 holds			2
oil rigs are mushrooming all over the hills , on the outskirts of cities			0
the exploration is entirely driven by and reliant on foreign companies able to shoulder the risk			0
@entity78 , the first of the majors , recently signed its own deal for six plots			1
it was a deal that elated the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) but it left the central government in @entity15 fuming as oil once again ended up mired in @entity1 politics			1
the @entity84 signs profit sharing deals , much to the ire of @entity15 -- which only signs service contracts and views the @entity84 deals as illegal and unconstitutional			1
@entity1 still does n't have a hydrocarbons -- or oil and gas -- law			1
while both sides agree that some revenues are funneled back to the central government , the dispute is over power and authority to sign contracts and the type of contract			2
both sides are so far unable to come to an agreement , and @entity15 blacklists any company that signs a deal with the @entity84			2
on december 5 , the @entity1 @entity110 approved a revised draft budget for 2012 of 117 trillion dinars ( $ 100 billion ) , government spokesman @entity109 said in a statement released on thursday			1
projected income estimates exports of 2.6 million barrels of oil per day including 175,000 barrels a day from the @entity117			2
the heightened tensions manifested themselves at a recent oil and gas conference in the capital of @entity6 , @entity0			2
the prime minister of the @entity84 , @entity123 addressed the conference , emphasizing : " i also say to our partners in @entity15 very clearly , @entity6 has a constitutional right to develop its own oil resources			1
" speaking on behalf of @entity15 , @entity127 , former national security advisor slammed back calling the deal illegal , threatening to ban and sue the oil giant			1
" in @entity15 some people view this contract to be targeting the federal government , to weaken the federal government and it has some political connotations			2
" but the @entity6 will not be stopped			2
" development of oil resources in @entity6 is a contribution to the @entity1 economy , " @entity123 told @entity2			1
" but there is also one other factor			0
our recent history is very instructive			0
there is no way that we will be dissuaded from our constitutional right to developing our resources and allow ourselves to ever again become hostages to the whims of some bureaucrats in @entity15			2
we 've been there before			0
oil was used to strangle our people , to commit genocide			0
" in the late 1980s @entity155 led a vicious @entity157 campaign against the @entity6 , forcibly displacing them from their homes and replacing them with @entity159			1
entire villages were razed to the ground			0
other places like @entity163 were gassed with deadly chemical agents			0
there is a continuing territorial dispute between the region of @entity6 and the rest of @entity1 , which is under the command of the predominantly @entity171 @entity159 central government in @entity15			1
the current @entity6 - @entity159 tensions do n't just center around land , but what 's underneath it			2
billions and billions of barrels of black gold are in disputed territories , like the oil rich city of @entity184 , all of which lends to the volatility			0
the @entity6 for their part are extremely worried about the vulnerable state that the @entity19 is leaving @entity1 in			1
" there is one fundamental topic for @entity1 , one fundamental challenge , " @entity123 says			0
" where do you want to be 10 years from now ? would we want to risk another centralized dictatorship with access to oil resources and turn it into weapons and tear into the communities and the people of @entity1 here again ? absolutely not			1
" @entity1 's tantalizing oil wealth could very easily turn from a blessing into a curse .			1

fight *brewing* over who has the rights to sign oil contracts for @entity1 's @entity6 region
@entity78 signed a deal with the @entity6 regional government that @entity15 says is illegal
@entity10 says it is working an oil field of at least 8 billion barrels -- one of the largest oil fields covered in this part of the world
as @entity6 insist they should sign the oil contracts , they also remember @entity155 attempts to wipe out their communities
