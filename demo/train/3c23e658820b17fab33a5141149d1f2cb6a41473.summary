-- researchers report a breakthrough in generating powerful antibodies that can neutralize @entity4			1
an hiv infection is really an intensive molecular arms race launched from the minute the virus infects a new host			0
@entity9 progresses not because the body is n't capable of fighting off @entity4 -- it is			2
but the immune defenses eventually succumb to the virus in the final standoff			0
now researchers led by @entity14 , director of the @entity15 at @entity16 , believe they have found a way to tip the odds in the immune system 's favor			1
from the moment of infection , the immune system goes on alert and immediately generates antibodies designed to attach to and destroy @entity4			1
and for the first few weeks , these antibodies are successful , eliminating all but a few viruses that remain hidden away from the body 's surveillance systems			0
these viral stalwarts then mutate to escape detection and start to flourish , expanding until new antibodies are generated to dispatch them			0
that launches another wave of viral destruction that pushes @entity4 to mutate yet again , prompting another immune attack , and so on , until eventually the body is n't able to keep up with the virus and pushes out poor , or no more additional antibodies that can neutralize @entity4			1
@entity0 : a newborn may be cured of @entity4			2
is the end of @entity9 near ? that 's the scenario in about 80 % of those who are infected with @entity4			2
but in a fortunate 20 % , this arms race is stacked in the host 's favor , with antibodies that are able to neutralize not just the latest , specific mutated version of @entity4 but a broader range of viral marauders			2
such broadly neutralizing antibodies are the holy grail of aids vaccine researchers , who hope to corral these agents in an immunization that can protect against infection			1
but most attempts to convince the body to churn out these antibodies have n't been successful , primarily because the antibodies take on an unusual shape that marks them for destruction by the very immune system that generated them			1
in addition , these antibodies can bind to and destroy healthy cells as well as hiv - infected ones , making them a potentially useful but unpredictable partner in fighting the virus			2
@entity0 : study explains how the first effective hiv vaccine worked but by carefully mapping the different mutations that @entity4 generates , and the resulting antibodies made against them in an @entity80 patient who is able to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies , @entity14 and his colleagues believe they have come up with a way to drive the immune system to preferentially churn out these @entity4 - fighting immune cells			1
" we followed individuals from the time of hiv infection to the time they generated broadly neutralizing antibodies , and mapped and isolated the virus at every step along the way so we now do n't have to guess any more about what induced those antibodies , " he says			0
" we have a map on how to recreate the sequential ( versions of @entity4 ) that could drive particular antibody lineages			2
" the work , which was published in the journal nature , was possible because @entity14 had collected and saved blood samples over the course of about three years from roughly 400 patients , starting within weeks of their infection			0
researchers found that the first round of broadly neutralizing antibodies generally appeared about 14 weeks after infection , and these were better able to bind to portions of @entity4 that the virus does n't change as quickly or as frequently			1
that makes the antibodies useful weapons in attacking the virus ' achilles heel , and a potentially powerful target for an effective vaccine			0
@entity0 : treatment as prevention : how the new way to control @entity4 came to be " now we have a picture of how these antibodies developed , so what we are doing is figuring out how to use them to make a vaccine , " says @entity14			1
the challenge will be to push the body to pump out these antibodies rather than the more specific ones aimed at the ever - changing portions of @entity4			1
it turns out that most infected people do produce these antibodies , but @entity4 distracts the immune system into crowding them out with all the subsequent iterations they convince the body to make against the mutating virus			1
" we are trying to take an unusual or rare event and make it more common , " says @entity14			0
@entity0 : @entity4 drugs may prevent infection in healthy individuals ultimately , he adds , a vaccine will probably need to generate several of these broadly neutralizing antibodies ; each person tends to make unique versions that have differing efficacy in stopping @entity4			1
but there 's precedent for such an approach , since the antiretroviral drugs that now control @entity4 infections are used in combination to hit the virus at more than one point in its life cycle			0
" the hope is that by mapping individual pathways to generating broadly neutralizing antibodies , we can find some commonalities among people even though everyone is different , and that gives us hope for using these pathways in a vaccine , " says @entity14			0
" it 's a huge effort but it looks like it 's going to pay off			0

researchers believe they *'ve* found a way to give our immune systems an *advantage*
the immune system could be made to churn out @entity4 - immune cells
there is hope that the discovery could be used in developing a vaccine
