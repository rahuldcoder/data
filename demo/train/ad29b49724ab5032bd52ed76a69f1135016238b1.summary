@entity0 -- gay rights activist @entity2 remembers keenly the day president @entity3 announced his support for same - sex marriage			1
there sat @entity3 , who for years had frustrated many in the gay community by not supporting same - sex marriage , telling @entity11 's @entity10 that conversations with his daughters and friends led him to change his mind			1
" when it finished i hit the replay button and i watched it again , " said @entity2 , executive director of @entity16 , a gay civil rights organization			0
" then i hit the replay button and watched it again			0
" @entity3 hosted a @entity21 reception friday in honor of @entity23 month , an event that brought the president full circle with a community whose support helped launch him into the @entity29			1
" after decades of inaction and indifference , you have every reason and right to push loudly and forcefully for equality , " @entity3 said at the event			2
" but three years ago i promised you this , i said that even if it took more time that i would like , we would see progress , we would see success , we would see real and lasting change , and together that 's what we 're witnessing			0
" it is also a community that , according to a recent @entity1 analysis of the president 's biggest openly gay " bundlers , " or fundraisers , helped add at least $ 8 million to @entity3 's campaign coffers between january and the end of march			1
" president @entity3 has the enormous admiration and appreciation of not just gay people , but people who care about gay people : our family , loved ones and friends			1
he has shown moral leadership and taken tremendous steps to end discrimination against gays , " said @entity60 , president of @entity61 to marry			0
the president " made such a heartfelt and personal description of how he had changed his mind ( on allowing gays to legally marry )			0
it 's the very same journey that a majority of @entity72 have taken			1
" according to a recent @entity1 / @entity73 , 54 % of @entity72 support legalizing marriages between gay and lesbian couples , with 42 % opposed			1
sixty percent of @entity72 also say they have a close friend or family member who is gay			1
this would seem to suggest good news for @entity3 , a man who @entity82 magazine recently dubbed @entity72 's " first gay president			1
" given his opposition to same - sex marriage and the pressure an openly gay staffer faced from conservatives , @entity85 presidential candidate @entity84 will be hard - pressed to get similar support from the gay and lesbian community			1
" my sense is that @entity84 perceives that not only to secure the nomination but to get the support of the @entity85 base he needs , he has to take a hard right stand on the issue of same - sex marriage , " said @entity94 , professor of public policy and political science at @entity97 and @entity98 and author of " from identity to @entity108 : the @entity109 in the @entity72			2
" @entity84 has not received an endorsement from @entity111 , a national gay and lesbian @entity85 organization			2
up until about eight weeks ago , some gay rights activists were feeling similarly tepid about @entity3 , @entity2 said			2
as a candidate in the last presidential election , @entity3 enjoyed rock star status among the gay and lesbian community			1
high - profile , openly gay figures such as musician @entity119 and @entity121 mogul @entity120 joined a grassroots army of supporters at campaign rallies for the @entity127 senator			0
but once in office , president @entity3 's efforts at pressing the case for gay rights were more muted , gay rights activists said			1
some in the community even felt betrayed			0
" the administration has done a great deal , but a lot of it was under the radar and less visible and people were focused on the big things , " @entity2 said			0
" ' @entity142 ' took a long time and his evolution on marriage took a long time			0
" still , some activists found reason to hope for change			0
the @entity3 administration criticized a measure in @entity151 , a swing state , that banned same - sex marriage and made civil unions illegal			2
the president took the same position on a similar @entity158 proposal			0
on friday , when the @entity160 held its first @entity23 event , defense secretary @entity159 highlighted the administration 's biggest accomplishment in the gay rights cause : repealing " do n't ask , do n't tell , " the military 's ban on openly gay and lesbian members serving in the forces			2
" the successful repeal of ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' proved to the nation that just like the country we defend , we share different backgrounds , different values and different beliefs but together we are the greatest military force in the world , " @entity159 said friday in a video message to troops			0
the administration 's push to emphasize the @entity21 's support of gay rights is meant to signal to supporters in that community that the president still stands with them , @entity94 said			1
" my sense is that it is going to firm up his support in the lesbian and gay community , " @entity94 said			1
@entity3 " has been quite cautious in how he approaches significant policy changes			2
he was afraid to take the lead on this issue until he felt it could be politically justified			0
it suggests to me a degree of caution that 's probably unwarranted given what he promised as a candidate			0

@entity3 has *boosted* his bona fides with gay community
54 % of @entity72 support legalizing marriages between gay and lesbian couples
