the @entity1 hack of @entity2 that unleashed proprietary information , leaked embarrassing emails and brought the multi-billion dollar company 's operations to its knees was unprecedented			0
but cyber security and intelligence experts warn that this is only the beginning			1
a @entity11 review of cyber attacks against federal agencies shows that the number of breaches into government systems is skyrocketing			1
" espionage is happening at a rate we have never seen before , " said @entity17 , a deputy director at the @entity18			0
the numbers seem to bear that out			0
there were almost 61,000 cyber attacks and security breaches across the entire federal government last year according to a recent @entity30 administration report			1
and the number of cyber incidents involving government agencies has jumped 35 percent between 2010 and 2013 , from roughly 34,000 to about 46,000 , according to another recent report by the @entity35			1
" this is a global problem			2
we do n't have a malware problem			2
we have an adversary problem			2
there are people being paid to try to get inside our systems 24/7 , " said @entity40 , vice president of the cyber security firm @entity42			1
unclassified networks at the @entity47 and @entity48 were recently hacked , leading the @entity48 to shut down its email system for days last month			1
related : @entity50 says @entity51 will respond to @entity1 but it 's not just spies looking to crack government computers			2
hackers are also after personal information accessible through government computer systems , not unlike their counterparts who have nabbed millions of credit and debit card numbers from @entity61 and @entity62			1
last july , hackers hit the @entity64 and took personally identifiable information from more than 100,000 people " that could be used to damage the financial and personal interests of many individuals , " according to a post-mortem report by the department 's inspector general			1
the data included names ; dates and places of birth ; social security and bank account numbers ; and information about their education and disabilities , according to the report			0
the hack cost the government almost $ 4 million in credit monitoring fees and lost productivity			2
@entity89 was one of the 100,000 people whose data was compromised by the attack , and the director of information security issues at the @entity35			0
he said the federal government 's information technology is " not as secure as it should be			1
@entity35 has been identifying this area as high risk since 1997			0
it 's been a longstanding challenge for the federal government to adequately protect its systems			1
" sometimes the threat comes from simple incompetence			0
last year , the @entity104 mistakenly posted tens of thousands of social security numbers on government websites , according to the nonprofit @entity107			2
perhaps not surprisingly , the @entity109 's inspector general for @entity110 says protecting taxpayer and employee data is the @entity104 ' most pressing challenge			0
related : hackers attacked the @entity51 energy grid 79 times this year @entity40 , the cyber security expert , points out that the @entity104 uses automated systems to process returns			1
if breached , billions of dollars in returns could be taken and the systems erased , forcing the @entity104 to use archives to try to reconstruct its system			2
" one attack could cripple the ( @entity104 ) system , " he said			0
another troubling incident happened last january when hackers hit the @entity128 and took sensitive information about the nation 's 85,000 dams			0
that data included their location , condition and potential for fatalities if the dams were to be breached , according to a report by sen. @entity140 , the ranking @entity141 on the @entity142			0
the uptick in security breaches is not because of a lack of spending , experts say			1
in fact , the @entity30 administration report showed that federal government agencies spent $ 10 billion on information security			1
the biggest culprits , experts say , are human error and a patchwork of different systems			1
billions of dollars in security ca n't stop an employee from clicking a malicious link			0
" there is no patch for a stupid user , " said @entity17 , who once oversaw a government cyber warfare program			1
indeed , this year 's @entity30 administration report found that so - called phishing attacks -- where users are duped into clicking links that open systems to hackers -- are the most widely reported cyber incident			1
in an ominous bit of foreshadowing of the @entity2 hack , national intelligence director @entity171 told @entity175 earlier this year that " the likelihood of a destructive attack that deletes information or renders systems inoperable will increase			2
" now , some experts say , an answer to the @entity2 hack is crucial			0
" we need to have a response whether it 's an industry or a government response so that folks understand there is a penalty here , " @entity17 said			0
" if they go unpunished , the message that sends is detrimental			0
" @entity192 : 5 lessons from the @entity2 hack			0

a @entity11 review of cyber attacks on federal agencies shows such breaches are a growing problem
the number of cyber attacks on government systems has jumped 35 percent in three years
one of the biggest culprits is human error , experts say
some of the victims include systems at the @entity47 and @entity64
