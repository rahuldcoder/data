-- a familiar refrain for many football fans is that it 's " the hope that kills you			0
" over the last two decades for one of the world 's most famous sports teams @entity5 , there 's been a lot of hope extinguished as a 121 - year - old football institution has failed to recapture its former dominance of @entity15 football			1
between 1973 and 1990 , the @entity15 championship was placed in the trophy cabinet at the club 's @entity19 stadium on 11 occasions			1
that domestic success was accompanied by continental glory as the @entity24 was taken to @entity25 four times between 1977 and 1984			0
but then came the famine			0
after sealing a then record 18th @entity15 title in 1990 , @entity5 has only sporadically shown signs of mounting a genuine @entity31 challenge -- until this season as the club makes an unlikely bid to win the league			1
like @entity5 fans , one of their outstanding performers this season @entity36 is dreaming big			1
" i think it 's important that we just go out there , work as hard as we can as a team in every game and perceive what the future holds , " @entity36 told @entity0 ahead of a key league match against @entity41			1
" we hope to have some success , we hope to be successful			2
there are 10 games to go so we 'll see where that takes us			0
" during that title famine , @entity53 had to watch on as great rival @entity41 established itself as the preeminent force in @entity15 football			1
in april last year , @entity41 beat @entity58 3 - 0 to clinch a 20th league title , meaning it stands alone as the most successful team in @entity15 soccer history			1
the two teams meet on sunday in a match which is about more than sporting pride			0
it 's a simmering century - old rivalry , shaped by resentment between the two cities -- separated by roughly 30 miles -- that has its roots in industrial history			0
but for the first time in two decades , the balance has shifted in the battle for power between these two storied clubs			0
@entity41 is floundering in seventh place in the table following a disastrous campaign which has so far seen manager @entity78 struggle to emulate his illustrious predecessor @entity79			1
while @entity41 are struggling to even qualify for @entity80 's premier tournament -- the @entity24 -- @entity5 is riding high			1
an exciting , vibrant team built by @entity83 coach @entity82 sits second in the @entity31 table , seven points behind leaders @entity86 but with a game in hand			1
the driving force behind @entity5 's rise have been goalscorers @entity93 and @entity36 , who have put the team in with a serious chance of ending a 24 - year wait for a 19th league title			1
@entity99 's @entity93 and @entity98 international @entity36 , dubbed the " @entity102 " by the @entity101 media , have scored 24 and 18 @entity31 goals respectively , rocketing @entity5 towards the top of the table			1
" @entity102 dynamic and dominant , but everyone contributing and effective , " tweeted @entity5 's @entity106 owner @entity105 , who also owns the @entity107 , after the recent 4 - 0 drubbing of @entity25 rivals @entity109			1
so with 10 games to go of the 2013 - 14 season , @entity5 fans are daring to hope			1
the turnaround in the team 's fortunes has been startling			0
it finished the 2012 - 13 campaign in seventh position , 28 points behind table - toppers @entity41 , 12 points adrift of fourth - place @entity123 and qualification for the lucrative @entity24			2
last season @entity5 finished with 61 points , but it has 59 points so far in the 2013 - 14 campaign with 30 points still to play for			2
@entity82 ' team has already won more matches than it did in the whole of last season -- 18 compared to 16 -- and it 's the most in - form team in the @entity31 with five wins from its last six games			2
the team 's recent positive results have been a source of encouragement for former @entity5 stalwart @entity141 , who made over 500 appearances for the @entity143 before calling time on his career at the end of the 2012 - 13 season			1
the former defender is even starting to believe that @entity82 ' emerging squad is capable of taking the title ahead of mega-rich powerhouses @entity86 and @entity151			0
" the way @entity154 has put the team together and the way they 're playing at the moment , they 're the most in - form team and the best time to be in - form is towards the end of the season , " @entity141 told @entity0			0
" they 've put themselves in with a great chance			0
you 'd still have to fancy @entity86 and @entity151 slightly ahead of them , but both those teams have to play at @entity19			0
i think it will depend on how they do in those games			0
" @entity172 , who is a former @entity5 teammate of @entity141 , has also been impressed by @entity82 ' flourishing team			2
" can they win the league ? of course they can , but i still think they 're two , three , four players short of having a squad to rival @entity151 and @entity86 , " said @entity172 , who enjoyed two @entity24 triumphs with @entity177 after joining the @entity179 club from @entity5			1
" i would always plump for those teams before @entity5			2
a great year for @entity5 would be to just get into the @entity24 , " added @entity172			2
" the step from finishing seventh last year and so many points behind to winning the league is huge			0
if they do it , i think it would be a monumental feat , but i think @entity24 football would be incredible this year			0
" like @entity141 , @entity36 predicts two potentially season - defining matches against @entity86 and @entity151			0
" i think they 're both favorites and they 're both a threat , " said the 24 - year - old of @entity5 's title rivals			2
" we 're going play them both at @entity19			0
it 's going to be a great occasion for myself and for the fans and my teammates of course			0
" but it 's important that we go out there and play the @entity5 way and enjoy it			2
" if @entity36 and @entity93 can fire in those two games , @entity5 could well end 24 years of hurt and give its fans renewed hope that the club can return to its former glories .			1
