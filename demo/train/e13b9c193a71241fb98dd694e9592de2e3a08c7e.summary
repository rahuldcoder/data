@entity0 -- a @entity3 district judge granted a preliminary injunction monday to stop federal funding of embryonic stem cell research that he said destroys embryos , ruling it went against the will of @entity10			1
the ruling by judge @entity12 was a blow to the @entity15 administration , which last year issued guidelines to allow federal funding for embryonic stem cell research			1
@entity12 's ruling said all embryonic stem cell research involves destroying embryos , which violates the @entity22 included in federal spending bills			1
" the @entity22 unambiguously prohibits the use of federal funds for all research in which a human embryo is destroyed , " said the ruling by @entity12 , who was nominated to the federal bench by then - president @entity26 in 1987			0
" it is not limited to prohibit federal funding of only the ' piece of research ' in which an embryo is destroyed			2
thus , if @entity38 [ embryonic stem cell ] research is research in which an embryo is destroyed , the guidelines , by funding @entity38 research , violate the @entity22			1
" president @entity15 signed an executive order in march 2009 that repealed a @entity45 - era policy limiting federal dollars for human stem cell research			2
@entity15 's act permitted the @entity49 to conduct and fund studies on embryonic stem cells			0
monday 's ruling involved a lawsuit against the @entity54 filed by researchers opposed to use of embryonic stem cells , a group that seeks adoptive parents for human embryos created through in vitro fertilization , the non-profit @entity62 and others			2
the ruling stops the federal funding of embryonic stem cell research while the lawsuit proceeds through the legal system			1
the government can appeal the injunction , and a @entity71 spokeswoman , @entity72 , said the decision was being reviewed			0
the field of embryonic stem cells has been highly controversial because the research process involves destroying the embryo , typically four or five days old , after removing stem cells			1
these cells are then blank and can become any cell in the body			0
embryonic stem cell research differs from other kinds of stem cell research , which do n't require embryos			1
some scientists believe embryonic stem cells could help treat many diseases and disabilities , because of their potential to develop into many different cell types in the body			2
while some advocates praised the executive order as a giant step forward for medical research , conservatives groups objected , contending that the destruction of human embryos ends human life			0
@entity101 , executive director of @entity102 -- one of the groups that filed the lawsuit -- said he supported adult stem cell research that does n't require destroying embryos			1
" frequently people will say why are you opposed to stem cell research and of course are answer is , we 're not , " @entity101 said			2
" we 're opposed to the destruction of the embryos to get embryo stem cells			0
" in a statement monday , the @entity116 for the @entity117 said it was disappointed by the injunction granted " in response to the latest maneuver by an ideologically driven fringe group			0
" " we have full confidence that the extensive , deliberative process that shaped federal guidelines now in place will be upheld upon further review , " the group 's statement said			0
@entity1 's @entity130 contributed to this story .			0

new : no word on possible government appeal as the lawsuit proceeds
