@entity2 was referred to with all these adjectives and more after his gig as host of the @entity6 on sunday night			2
the " @entity8 " and " @entity9 " creator received mixed reviews for his singing , dancing and jokes , with @entity14 critic @entity13 dubbing @entity15			0
" " in the run up to sunday 's @entity18 , @entity16 promoted the broadcast as : ' finally ! an @entity18 the guys can enjoy ! ' what did that mean , exactly ? " @entity13 wrote			1
" time for me to turn in my @entity23 , i guess			0
" talk back : did @entity2 hit or miss at the @entity18 ? @entity24 is known for his male - centric humor			1
he is the creator of @entity26 , a profane stuffed bear who , during his appearance as an @entity18 presenter , begged to be let in on the post-ceremony celebrity orgies he had heard so much about			1
so was there much surprise that one of @entity24 's opening numbers was a little ditty titled " @entity6 " ? " i 'll limit my discussion of ' @entity6 ' to noting how , um , nakedly it put into relief a recurring theme in last night 's ceremony : a defensive anxiety about the ascendant power of women ( emblematized , later on , by the pairing of the statuesque [ @entity50 ] @entity49 with the wee @entity52 as awards presenters ) , " wrote @entity43 's @entity42			1
' @entity18 2013 : ' @entity54 ' all the way according to @entity57 , the @entity56 slammed the host for a joke made by @entity26 ( voiced by @entity24 ) about @entity60 in @entity61			1
" while we have come to expect inappropriate ' @entity60 control @entity61 ' jokes from @entity2 , what he did at the @entity18 was offensive and not remotely funny			1
it only reinforces stereotypes which legitimize anti-semitism , " the @entity56 wrote in a statement , according to the reporter			1
" it is sad and disheartening that the @entity18 awards show sought to use @entity72 stereotypes for laughs			2
" there were a few uncomfortable moments , such as a date night / domestic violence reference to singer @entity77 and @entity78 that earned some groans			0
and you could feel the audience wince when @entity24 tossed off , " this is interesting			2
@entity84 not the first actor to be nominated for playing @entity86			0
@entity87 portrayed him in 1940 's ' @entity88			0
i would argue , however , that the actor who really got inside @entity86 's head was @entity93			0
" after more than a hundred years , can a joke still be too soon ? @entity96 's review called @entity24 's hosting performance " self - indulgent , " noting that " @entity18 fans have seen a lot over the years , but this may be the first time they 've ever seen a host use the awards to audition for his own variety show			1
" memorable moments from the show the @entity108 headlined its story " @entity110 of @entity2 's @entity111 at the @entity18 " and opened with a vignette of the host 's brief introduction of @entity115 : " our next presenter needs no introduction " before walking away			1
" if only he 'd kept his shut more frequently , " they said			0
but @entity121 from @entity57 praised the @entity123 's choice and pointed out that it clearly knew @entity24 would be a " polarizing choice			1
" " in fact , @entity24 was relatively tame if you know anything at all about his canon , and he was respectful through and through , " @entity121 wrote			2
" as a guy who can actually sing and has recorded a successful album ( fueling more jealousy and backlash from his detractors ) , his pick was more spot - on than anyone gave the @entity123 credit for			2
" even @entity142 , who won an @entity143 for her turn in " @entity145 " and was name - checked in the boob song , found the humor in it			0
" i loved the boob song			0
i thought he was great			0
i thought he was hilarious , " she said backstage			0
but the critics always seem to have the loudest voices , especially the one place you can hear them shriek the loudest : @entity156			0
salon pulled some of @entity24 critiques from the microblogging site , including comic @entity162 's take : " well , we thought you were great ! " -- @entity2 's family in about four hours , " @entity162 tweeted .			1

new : @entity56 slams @entity24 for @entity60 in @entity61 joke
the world had lots to say about @entity24 as @entity18 host
some of his bits were viewed as sexist
one reviewer said @entity123 took a *chance* -- and won
