an investigation into the killing of the most senior @entity3 military officer since 9/11 found the incident could not have been " foreseen " or " prevented , " according to a military report out thursday			1
maj. gen. @entity6 , who was leading efforts to train soldiers in @entity9 , was killed by a member of the @entity11 on aug. 5 during a visit to a military training facility in @entity14			1
the report was from the @entity16 , which serves as @entity18 's command over allied military operations in @entity9			1
@entity6 , along with more than 90 other @entity3 and @entity21 personnel , visited the @entity22 to take a look at the construction of a site at the school that would serve officers in the @entity11			1
according to the report , overall security at the site was provided by @entity32 forces , but there were protection forces from the @entity3 , @entity35 and @entity36 also present			2
but despite " extensive security planning " for the event , the report said " there was no comprehensive plan that incorporated all participating security elements , " as each individual security detachment did their own preparation			2
" the threat level that day was assessed as low , with no indicators of unusual activity or concern , " the report said			0
@entity16 identified the shooter as @entity51 , a soldier with the @entity11 who entered the barracks at the university where the presentation was taking place and positioned himself in a nearby bathroom in direct view of the delegation and fired 27 -- 30 rounds in to the crowd			1
in addition to @entity6 , 18 others were seriously wounded			1
two @entity63 returned fire and killed the shooter			0
" although there have been many leads , nothing has yet materialized that conclusively links the shooter to any plots , plans or person of interest , " the report said			0
" it appears the shooting was not pre-meditated , and the shooter simply took advantage a target of opportunity provided by the close gathering			0
" the report raised the possibility the shooter may have been " self - radicalized " or suffered from some type of psychological condition			0
while visits to the site from various officials are a regular occurrence , the report said the incident appeared to be an " isolated act of a determined shooter without indicators or warnings			0
" @entity16 made recommendations for greater risk assessment planning of such events and visits in the future , as well as a review of @entity16 's standard on the use of personal protective equipment .			2
