@entity0 -- @entity2 can taste like a mix of cheap perfume and cleaning agents to the uninitiated palate			1
the clear alcohol , which is distilled from sorghum , glutinous rice or even wheat , is considered a national drink of @entity12			0
it is also the world 's most consumed spirit by volume			0
according to @entity17 , baijiu accounts for more than a third of all spirits consumed globally			1
but there remains little thirst for it outside of @entity12			0
a crackdown on @entity27 officials ' lavish spending has affected domestic sales of baijiu , a customary drink at banquets and a common luxury gift			1
@entity2 producers concerned with the slump in sales are looking to expand the overseas market , but results remain to be seen			1
meanwhile , a new english - language publication hopes to achieve the seemingly impossible : make @entity40 fall in love with baijiu			1
debunking myths @entity45 author @entity44 would be the first one to agree that baijiu is an acquired taste			1
his book " @entity2 : the @entity58 to @entity59 , " released last month , began as a blog documenting @entity44 ' experiment to drink 300 shots of the stuff -- rumor has it , that is how much rookies need to drink before learning to enjoy the flavor			1
about 75 shots in , @entity44 says he already started to appreciate the drink			1
he 's now a ready evangelist for the spirit , hoping to debunk all baijiu myths			2
" right now the understanding of baijiu , and traditional @entity67 alcohols in general , is extremely low , " @entity44 says			1
" the biggest misconception is that the word ' baijiu ' signifies a single type of spirit			1
@entity2 is actually a byword for all grain - based spirits produced using traditional @entity27 techniques			1
it 's a broad category that includes more than a dozen distinct liquors			0
" different baijius range in strength from over 60 % alcohol by volume , to a far gentler 30 %			0
they also have distinct flavor profiles , with classifications including " light aroma , " " heavy aroma , " and " sauce aroma			0
" " @entity92 aroma " is the class of baijiu that many @entity40 find most palatable			2
the misconception that @entity44 says most threatens baijiu 's success overseas , however , is that it is dangerous to the drinker 's health			1
in fact , " baijiu is no more unhealthy than your average rum or whiskey			2
" attempts have been made to popularize baijiu in the @entity45			1
the @entity107 , @entity108 - based distillery @entity106 is importing a baijiu base that is then filtered and sold in the @entity45 while in @entity110 , @entity111 , baijiu is produced at @entity113 in small amounts as an artisanal product			1
@entity44 is excited about these developments : " these efforts are relatively recent and which approach will be most successful remains to be seen			2
" " i 'm optimistic that baijiu will establish a foothold outside of @entity12 , but it wo n't happen overnight			2
" for dinner , not parties in @entity12 , the baijiu industry faces its own challenges			0
in a bid to curtail lavish government spending , president @entity126 has reined in officials ' budgets for banqueting , and has curbed a culture of gifting , popularly associated with corruption			0
the measures have seen profits of luxury status - symbol brands of baijiu fall sharply			2
@entity2 made $ 81 billion last year , according to the @entity139			2
the growth rate is 15.6 % lower than in 2012 , with a 2 % drop in profits			0
the setbacks have affected @entity145 liquor giant @entity144 , which owns a controlling stake in the @entity148 holding company , the largest shareholder of @entity152 baijiu brand @entity150			0
@entity144 ceo @entity153 anticipates that the baijiu market will recover in 2015			0
younger drinkers questions remain , however , over the longer term future of the spirit , which is less popular among young people , and faces growing competition from foreign spirits			0
@entity163 , 39 , is the owner of @entity164 , a @entity0 bar celebrated for its @entity27 perspective on @entity167 cocktail making			2
the bar does n't offer straight baijiu , but does use it in several mixed drinks , including a " @entity171 and @entity172 , " which contains 30ml of rum to only 5ml of the potent @entity27 liquor			1
@entity163 says that alcohol consumption differs greatly by region , with baijiu popular in rural areas , the north , and the southwest of @entity12			0
regarding younger drinkers , he says , " those from baijiu consuming regions will carry on drinking it			0
but to the @entity27 , baijiu is still consumed during meal times			1
once they go out to party at night , they will switch to imported spirits			1
" @entity163 himself tends to drink baijiu at dinner or with business partners , but mostly in second or third tier cities , not in @entity0			0
nevertheless , the bar owner is cautiously optimistic about a future for baijiu outside @entity12			0
" it is difficult because it has an acquired smell and taste , similar to stinky tofu			0
either you like it or hate it			0
