@entity0 , @entity1 -- sewage - lined streets , crumbling concrete homes and jagged sheets of metal are in stark contrast to the formally dressed man standing proudly in the middle of it all			1
he grimaces into a @entity15 cigar and happily sports two pairs of designer sunglasses ; one straddling his eyes , the other tucked into his suit			1
he is a loyal and unapologetic member of " @entity22			2
" in this @entity0 neighborhood , eight of them strut the congested streets , decked out in a wide - array of name brands ; from @entity29 and @entity30 to @entity31 and @entity32			1
three - piece suits , shiny black leather shoes and flashy accessories are all part of an eccentric dress code -- and demeanor to match			2
" i could use that money to help with the war that is happening in the @entity44 but [ they 're ] so expensive it might hurt people 's feelings , " says @entity39 , of his pricey threads			1
see also : arise magazine : @entity51 's fashion bible he describes himself as the " supreme commander of @entity54 " or " sap " for short			1
while he would n't admit to the actual cost , some saps boast of spending $ 5,000 on a single suit			2
but in a country with one of the highest poverty levels in the world , how is a trend like this even possible or accepted ? part of the performance put on by @entity54 is showmanship , smoke and mirrors			1
@entity69 is actually a shoemaker and designer by trade so he stitches up and repairs each member 's look			1
his crew dresses up together just once a week , meeting first at @entity39 's shoe - repair shack in the parking lot of a local bar before stepping out			2
it 's also typical for @entity22 to trade their expensive clothes with each other to keep up an appearance of affluence			1
still , the @entity87 following has cultural significance beyond the facade of fabric			0
born out of gradual economic improvements leading up to independence , both the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) and its confusingly named neighbor , the @entity1 , broke free of @entity94 and @entity96 's colonial grip respectively in 1960			0
the capitals of @entity0 and @entity98 on opposing sides of the @entity100 became centers for a new @entity103 francophone elite , flying to @entity104 and returning to show off sophisticated garments			1
for the first time in the modern era , the @entity1 were empowered after decades of brutality and economic subjugation enforced by foreigners			0
@entity111 , the famous singer credited with popularizing the @entity87 look with his group @entity112 , says inspiration partly came from his parents who took great pride in dressing up on sundays back in the ' 60s , " always well put together , always looking very smart			1
" see also : @entity103 designers in the spotlight things changed in the @entity1 shortly after independence , when @entity120 assumed power , renamed the country @entity1 and implemented a strict @entity124 dress code			0
@entity111 wanted to challenging the status quo -- not vocally , but visually			1
so he devised the acronym @entity127 , roughly translated from @entity128 to mean " the society of atmosphere - setters and @entity130			0
" by dressing up his band in the @entity127 style , the adoring @entity1 crowds soon followed suit -- literally			0
since then , @entity87 swagger and the freedom of expression it represents have attracted legions of followers in @entity51 and beyond			0
by now they 've earned an increasingly visible status in popular culture ; @entity144 photographer @entity143 profiled them in his book " @entity147 , " the @entity148 anointed them " the most unlikely fashionistas			2
" they pop up in music videos and in the book " @entity155 , " the saps are included in great detail			0
they are an important part of the @entity1 story			0
@entity111 invited @entity2 to one of his musical performances in @entity0 being attended by @entity69 and company and it became obvious how serious this movement is today			1
a dapperly dressed @entity87 from a competing clique danced with a woman in front of @entity69 and afterward flung open his cape -- yes , cape -- kicking - off a fashion face - off			0
what followed were multiple poses on the dance floor as each @entity87 defended his reputation			0
labels were revealed , heads flung high and jackets swung around			0
in a country torn apart by colonialism , corruption , civil war and poverty , these men have found something refreshing in which they can take great pride			2
they 've also devised a sort - of entertaining conflict resolution that requires buttons instead of bullets , belts instead of bombs			0
in a very real way , we could all learn something from these special @entity1 standouts : honor history , keep conflict resolution peaceful and never tell anyone how much you really paid for your fancy clothes .			2

" @entity54 " are a unique group of fashionistas who strut the streets of @entity0
they wear expensive designer clothes , despite the poverty around them
famed musician @entity111 popularized the movement
