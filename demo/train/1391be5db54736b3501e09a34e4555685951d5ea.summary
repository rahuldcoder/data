-- @entity2 's @entity1 was on tuesday facing a fresh barrage of allegations over its business practices after an @entity8 newspaper released 14,000 emails concerning one of the group 's security subsidiaries			1
the emails , said to be from the hard drive of a former head of security at @entity17 , a former @entity1 subsidiary , appear to show that the company paid computer hackers to work with its " operational security " unit			1
the cache sheds further light on commercial disputes between @entity1 and pay - tv rivals that now span @entity25 , @entity26 , and the @entity27			1
the @entity28 claimed that @entity17 's activities in @entity8 in 1999 caused millions of dollars of damage to mr @entity2 's rivals in the country 's nascent pay - tv market			1
the business models of @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 were all damaged by a wave of high - tech piracy at that time			2
the @entity8 newspaper said the emails had originated from the computer of @entity42 , a former commander in the @entity43 in @entity44 , who served as head of operational security for @entity17 in @entity26 from 1996 to 2002			2
@entity17 had no immediate comment but @entity1 said : " @entity1 is proud to have worked with @entity17 , whose industry - leading technology has transformed tv viewing for millions of people across the world , and to have supported them in their aggressive fight against piracy and copyright infringement			1
" allegations of fierce competitive behaviour , which were not illegal under @entity8 law at the time , the @entity28 said , came a day after the @entity61 's @entity60 programme levelled similar charges against @entity17 's conduct in the @entity64			2
the television programme said that @entity17 used hackers to crack the security of the encryption cards of @entity69 , the @entity64 broadcaster @entity71 's entrant in the pay - television market , which went bust in 2002 in the face of competition by @entity1 's @entity78 unit			1
in one email purportedly from the hard drive , @entity17 employees discuss the fact that a @entity26 pay - tv company which @entity1 was poised to take a stake in was " totally hacked " by pirates			1
the sender of the email debated whether , in light of the @entity1 interest in the company , @entity17 should " start to protect [ the particular model of encryption used by the company ] while leaving the main			2
in a detailed statement after the @entity60 programme , @entity17 denied ever using hackers against other companies			0
" like most companies in the conditional access industry -- and many law enforcement agencies -- @entity17 uses industry contacts to track and catch both hackers and pirates			0
this is neither illegal nor unethical			0
and , to ensure that all activity remains completely within legal bounds , @entity17 staff and their contacts operate under a clear code of conduct for operating undercover			0
" these allegations were the subject of a long - running court case in the @entity27			0

" some of the emails released on tuesday played a part in that case , where the @entity27 pay - tv platform @entity122 won part of its claim , but was awarded trivial damages and was ordered to pay @entity17 's costs			1
in the @entity60 programme , mr @entity42 denied ever having seen or handled encryption codes or cards that would have allowed anyone to hack @entity69 's machines			0
@entity132 , the opposition @entity133 mp who has led @entity64 parliamentary investigations into mr @entity2 's group and the @entity64 phone hacking scandal , said he had written to the broadcasting regulator @entity139 , asking it to include the @entity60 allegations in its inquiry into whether @entity1 and its executives were " fit and proper " to own a broadcasting licence			2
