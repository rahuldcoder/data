@entity0 , @entity1 -- the headlines friday in @entity1 spoke of a bloodbath , of war			1
the morning after carnage at a platinum mine , @entity1 grappled with shock , memories of an ugly era resurrected in their minds			1
the word apartheid surfaced again as people debated the need for such police force			1
the police , meanwhile , explained themselves at a news conference , giving reporters the grim toll : 34 mine workers killed , 78 others wounded , 259 arrested on various charges , including malicious damage to property , armed robbery , illegal gathering and possession of weapons			1
that according to police commissioner @entity30			1
she said police " were forced to utilize maximum force to defend themselves			1
" @entity1 president @entity34 cut short a trip to @entity36 to visit the scene of the shootings friday afternoon			1
he announced the government will open an inquiry of the incident			1
he told @entity1 that they must come together to overcome national challenges as they had done before			1
" this is not a day to apportion blame , " @entity34 said			1
" it is a day for us to mourn together as a nation			0
it is also a day to start healing			0
" mourn , yes , but also a time to think about what had been done , some cried			0
rising tensions explode into grisly violence at @entity1 mine " @entity1 lives cheap as ever , " read a headline in a @entity57 newspaper			1
it editorialized that @entity1 's economic woes do require a war			1
" but a different kind of war -- a war of ideas			1
not a war that dispenses with human life in as cheaply a manner as we have seen in @entity0			0
" the tragedy began unfolding a week ago when miners went on strike demanding pay hikes at the mine near @entity75 , about two hours northwest of @entity76			1
they were rock drillers who worked at the dangerous depths of the mine , their bodies vibrating for the duration of their eight - hour shifts			1
" when there is a rock fall , it is generally the drillers who are the victims , " wrote journalist @entity85 in the @entity87 newspaper			0
" it is the most dangerous job in the business			0
" the miners , who earned $ 300 to $ 500 a month , wanted their salaries raised to $ 1,500			0
it came as no surprise that their multi-national employer , @entity100 , said no to the whopping increase			0
the world 's third - largest producer of platinum said the strike was illegal			1
the larger problem , however , went beyond a wage dispute			0
it had to do with a vicious rivalry between two unions -- the dominant and established @entity111 and the splinter @entity112 which has been encroaching on the former 's role			1
what 's behind the marikana massacre ? the @entity111 is a close ally of the country 's ruling @entity122			2
the miners , according to several @entity1 media outlets , feel they are not adequately represented by the battling unions			1
they say politics gets in the way and that each union vies for miners ' support and yet they do n't always seek their best interests			0
in january , at least three people were killed during a strike at the world 's second - largest platinum mine , @entity136			1
the violence there , too , was blamed on union rivalry			2
the two unions , accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages , denied instigating the clashes			0
tensions at @entity0 had mounted throughout the week			2
the striking miners carried traditional panga machetes and gathered thursday around a small hill			1
police carried anti-riot equipment and encircled the protesting workers			1
by then , at least 10 other people were dead from incidents that had occurred in the days before			2
among them were two police officers who were hacked to death			2
journalists who were at @entity0 said police seemed fed up with the miners and determined to resolve the issue			2
" yesterday the police were clear that today we are going to disarm them and remove them from the hill because the gathering is illegal , " said @entity160 , a reporter for @entity2 affiliate @entity161			2
by thursday afternoon , another round of negotiations among the striking miners , the unions and @entity100 had failed			1
the miners chanted war songs , witnesses said			0
a heavily armed police @entity173 moved in to disperse the miners			2
what happened next is unclear			0
how diamonds , mining fuel @entity1 's conflicts to hear @entity30 , the police commissioner , describe it , the police weighed all their options and decided to fence in the miners with barbed wire -- to compartmentalize them into more manageable groups			1
she defended police actions , saying it was a desperate last measure against dangerous protesters			2
" the armed protesters moved toward the police , " she said			2
" they were driven back with tear gas and rubber bullets			0
but when they fired , police used maximum force			1
" but journalists at the scene could not say whether the protesters fired first			2
" we can not say to you the police were provoked , " @entity160 said			2
then , the police unleashed a barrage of gunfire			2
one witness said it went on for three minutes			0
men dropped to the ground			0
some lay motionless ; others were still moving			0
blood spilled onto the parched earth			0
the images spread fast on the news , on the @entity212			0
@entity0 was one of the bloodiest incidents since apartheid ended in 1994			2
@entity1 were taken back to that time of mandated racial separation and horrific incidents of police brutality against black people			1
some likened @entity0 to @entity219 , where in 1960 , police fired on a crowd of black demonstrators , killing 69			1
there was clear evidence , the @entity223 said , that policemen randomly shot into the crowd with rifles and handguns			0
" there is also evidence of their continuing to shoot after a number of bodies can be seen dropping and others turning to run			0
this is reminiscent of the @entity219 massacre in 1960			1
" in our view , " the institute said , " what happened at @entity100 is completely unacceptable			0
we hold no brief for the use of violence in labor or any other disputes			2
but even if the police were provoked or shot at during yesterday 's incident , or were angry at the killing of two police officers in the days before , no disciplined and properly trained policeman would shoot into a crowd			1
yesterday 's incident was a disaster waiting to happen			2
" @entity0 , said some , exposed deep - rooted problems that have been bubbling in @entity1			1
" i think this us a sign of underlying structural issues which you have seen in @entity1 for a long time , " said @entity256 , an @entity1 analyst with the risk research firm @entity257			1
" there has been an increase in violent protests both by miners and also by citizens living in townships who are upset with the level and pace of service delivery , " he said			0
people are no longer willing to sit and wait around for the @entity122 to deliver			2
" they are becoming more and more impatient and they 're becoming more and more violent as a result , " @entity256 said			0
@entity100 's chief financial officer , @entity275 , called the situation " tragic " and expressed condolences to the family and friends of the workers and police officers who died this week			1
he said the company would assist with funerals and grief counseling			0
@entity275 said @entity100 has worked for years to achieve good labor relations and said the " illegal strike we 've seen is so disappointing and damaging			0
" " if the industry continues to be damaged by illegal actions it is not just the economy which suffers , but all our employees , their families and dependents , " @entity275 said about @entity1 's vital mining sector			1
" we need our employees to come back to work and we need to get mining again			0
" but friday at @entity0 , all was quiet			0
the @entity100 mine remained shut			0
on the dry , dusty surrounding streets , a heavy police presence remained			0
and women searched desperately for husbands , fathers and brothers who did not come home			0
a 9 - year - old boy said he saw his father shot on television			0
one of the miners , who did not want to be identified , told @entity2 that none of the mine workers fired at police			1
but regardless of whether their actions were legal or illegal , he said , none of this should have happened			0
" they should not have died , " he said			0
" all they want is a wage increase			0
" he said he thought @entity1 was a democracy , a nation of free people			1
but it did n't feel that way this week at @entity0			0
how to avoid buying ' blood phones ' @entity2 's @entity326 and @entity327 contributed from @entity1 , and @entity328 and @entity329 , from @entity330 .			1

president @entity34 announces a government inquiry of the incident
some @entity1 compare incident to apartheid - era @entity219 massacre
police say they fired at the striking workers in self - defense
