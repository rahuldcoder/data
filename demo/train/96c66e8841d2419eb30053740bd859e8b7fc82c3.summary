would be described as " mad , bad and dangerous to know			0
" locals get about in traffic - heavy @entity3 on motorcycles known as okadas			1
but we all know that these types of people are usually the most exciting kind			0
they are a lot of fun and you just never know what 's going to happen when they 're around			0
by the same token , any visitor to @entity3 should prepare for the unexpected -- it can feel like a literal assault on the senses from the moment you step off the plane and feel the intensity of the dense tropical heat			1
@entity3 is big , brash and bold and creaks under the weight of the 17 million people who live there			1
the former capital of @entity32 , @entity3 remains its economic nerve center and teems constantly with the buzz of buying and selling ( usually performed at the top of the vendors ' voices			1
) there 's only one volume level in @entity3 and that 's loud			1
from the constant tooting of horns in the snail - paced traffic , known locally as go slows , to music blaring from homes round - the - clock , the city buzzes constantly with noise			2
getting around is not easy and you will be caught in the frequent go slows , where you will be confronted by vendors selling all manner of things , from @entity57 merchandise to dinner sets to plantain chips to frozen yogurts			0
locals often joke they can kit out their entire home in a short car journey			2
the city is divided into three islands adjacent to each other and the mainland			0
most expatriates and employees of multinationals , that proliferate in @entity3 , are based on two of the islands ; @entity73 and @entity74			1
the vast majority of wealth in the city is concentrated on these upmarket islands , with their western - style shopping malls and entertainment complexes			0
the best restaurants , bars , boutiques and galleries can also be found here and it 's best to stick to these areas to make the most of your time in @entity3			1
a stay in @entity3 would be incomplete without visiting one of the lively and colorful markets like the @entity95 market off @entity96 , @entity97			1
it is not for the meek or faint - hearted but you 're guaranteed to get a bargain or two if you 're prepared for a good haggle			2
it 's great for @entity104 prints and carvings but is a maze of a market , so best to hop on the back of popular motorcycles known locally as okadas to help you navigate it			2
to relax from all that haggling , you can head down to one of the five beaches in the city -- the best of them is @entity119 -- a small beach at the entrance to the @entity3 port			1
it is easily accessible by boat from @entity124 at @entity125 ( around $ 6 per person ) or under @entity128 bridge on @entity74			0
at @entity119 you can browse through some local african arts , cloth or even locally produced honey brought round by the occasional hawker			0
for a spot of lunch , make like locals and indulge in some " pepper fish " or suya -- very spicy chunks of meat , similar to kebabs , cooked over a charcoal grill ) , washed down with ice cold beer			0
for authentic @entity32 cuisine that wo n't give your stomach too much " wahalla " ( trouble ) , the @entity149 restaurant on @entity150 , @entity74 is recommended			0
those with an adventurous palate can order the special delicacy of @entity156 - goat 's head , while others can tuck into jollof rice and chicken or spicy bean cakes ( moi - moi ) -- a favorite with most @entity32			0
for a spot of culture , a short taxi ride away is one of the city 's main attractions , the @entity168 on @entity169 , @entity170			0
it opened in 1957 and houses bronze sculptures and ivory carvings from @entity174 dating back 300 years			0
is @entity3 the most exciting city in @entity104 ? use the @entity177 box below to have your say			1
if you are in the market for some art , you can pick up some tasteful , but admittedly , not cheap , @entity32 art at the @entity184 boutique hotel in @entity185			0
the hotel owner 's brother , @entity186 , will take you to his studio where you can see the artists at work			0
@entity3 is a see - and - be - seen place and later you can party at one of the most fashionable places in town , @entity196 on @entity197 , off @entity198 , a fun cocktail bar with a @entity201 vibe and salsa dancing			1
@entity3 also let their hair down over a bucket of champagne or two at @entity206 in @entity207 , owned by @entity32 football star @entity208			2
there 's no chance of missing it as his name is engraved with golden letters above the entrance ! be prepared to empty your wallet though , as @entity3 are big spenders			1
however , if your taste is less opulent , visit one of the numerous beer parlors found on every street corner and which are open 24 hours a day			0
@entity3 is a city that never sleeps			1
for those staying on the mainland , check if musician @entity224 is in town on a sunday and go to " @entity226 " , @entity227 - the home of @entity229			1
this is an amazing experience reminiscent of his dad , the legendary musician @entity232			1
or you can catch the current king of @entity229 , @entity235 at his club @entity236 ' on @entity237 , @entity227			2
the clubs do n't kick off in earnest until around 10pm and you can party well into the night , just do n't forget to make it in time for your flight home ! @entity0 's @entity243 contributed to this report			2

@entity3 is a *vibrant* , *exuberant* city that never sleeps
you can shop for @entity104 fabrics at the local markets , just be prepared to haggle !
party at @entity253 nightclub , home of legendary @entity229 musician @entity232
