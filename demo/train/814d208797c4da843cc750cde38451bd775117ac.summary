-- despite the fact that basic math and science cause me to bleed from my ears , i once confidently oversaw the design and construction of a fully functional nuclear power plant that provided safe energy to thousands of people			1
hell , i even placed it next to a playground			1
and for decades it never once experienced so much as the slightest hint of disaster			1
" sir , you better take a look at this			2
" " aww , jeez			2
" yes , that was a rather dark day in the thriving metropolis of @entity24			2
so , in response , as mayor , i quickly approved funding for a new football stadium			2
which did n't seem to help with disaster management			2
" sir , the people would like a word with you			2
" of course , i was never really mayor of a town -- i do n't wear pants nearly often enough to hold down that kind of job -- but i did enthusiastically play one on the classic city - building simulator , " @entity41			1
" so , you can only imagine the excitement i felt recently when the @entity44 suddenly starting buzzing about the upcoming release of a brand new version of the only video game i ever loved			1
and as more and more mentions of it started popping up all over the @entity50 , one thing became perfectly clear : i was n't alone in my undying passion for building fake roads			1
that said , it 's been many years and several epic steps in computer technology since i 've actually played the game ( it debuted in 1989 )			1
however , on march 5 , those of us who have long fancied ourselves as urban planners will get a completely modern version of " @entity41 " to once again assist us in the gleeful neglect of our jobs , family , and personal hygiene			1
which , when you think about it , is fairly amazing			2
" @entity68 " should n't be fun			2
not even a little bit			2
essentially , it 's local governance			2
and from someone who just went through the process of obtaining a real - life building variance , i can assure you that @entity77 is n't exactly the ball pit at @entity79			1
and it probably has more traces of feces			0
yet , somehow , laying out your very own town from scratch , managing its budget , and occasionally destroying the whole community with monsters and earthquakes is unquestionably appealing			1
the true beauty of " @entity41 " is that for every disgruntled person who ever said , " this whole place is run by idiots , " the game offers a way for you to prove to the world -- or at least , maybe , to your cat -- that you can do better			1
and , if nothing else , you can definitely take out all your day - to - day frustrations by bulldozing a train station			0
you know , without actually bulldozing a train station			0
which , after a full week of intense investigative journalism , i can now confirm is " illegal			0
" so , the other day , as a remarkably distinguished member of the international media , i had the opportunity to play a pre-release trial version of the new " @entity41 , " thus making it a five - star weekend			1
you have your major accomplishments in life			0
unfortunately , however , on that beautiful and momentous saturday i actually had to borrow my friend 's pc laptop to do so -- which made me feel both confused and dirty			0
or at least more so than normal			0
sadly , the @entity118 version of the game wo n't be available until later in the spring			1
so , the cool kids will just have to wait			0
which is going to be tough			0
seriously , if i was a grizzly bear i 'd probably just hibernate until late april , wake up , stretch , murder a bunch of salmon , and then immediately download the new " @entity41			1
" and then murder more salmon			0
because i 'm a grizzly bear			0
who owns a @entity129 so , here 's what i can tell you : the graphics are really pretty			0
and it 's very thorough			0
i ca n't confirm this , but it 's entirely possible that you have to choose interior wallpaper for the local vd clinic			0
also known as the future home of @entity141			0
what can i say ? i like to name things in my pretend community			1
our future @entity146 team will play in the @entity149 and @entity148 ! aside from the updated , fancy graphics and insane attention to detail , the other notable highlight of this new version of the game is the option for multiplayer and multicity			1
you can actually manage up to 16 towns at once and compete against other people			1
@entity162 , personally , i prefer to make " @entity41 " a simple , private affair			1
it 's much easier to willfully launch a tornado on the trailer park when you do n't have to answer to anyone			0
who i imagine will be super enthusiastic to live in my temporary disaster housing , @entity174			0
our motto : " we want you to be happy ! " and why should n't they be ? they 'll have a great view of the nuclear power plant			0
" sir , the people would like a word with you			0
