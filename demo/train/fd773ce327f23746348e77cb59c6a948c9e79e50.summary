-- a school board in @entity2 has voted to fire all teachers at a struggling high school , a dramatic move aimed at shoring up education in a poverty - ridden school district			1
in a 5 - 2 vote tuesday night , the board approved the plan by @entity11 , superintendent at @entity12 , to discharge the teachers , administrators and other personnel at @entity16			1
the firings , which will be effective at the end of this school year , came after the district said it failed to reach an agreement with the teachers ' union on a plan for the teachers to spend more time with students to improve test scores			1
a union spokesman called the firings drastic and cited a 21 percent rise in reading scores and a 3 percent increase in math scores in the past two years			2
the school district said 93 people -- including the principal , three assistant principals and 77 teachers -- were fired			1
the teachers ' union said the firings affected 74 classroom teachers plus a number of other educators such as guidance counselors and reading specialists			1
@entity47 is one of the lowest - performing schools in @entity2			0
it is in a community where median income is $ 22,000 , census figures show			0
of the 800 students , 65 percent are @entity55 and for most of them , @entity56 is a second language			2
half the students are failing every subject , with 55 percent skilled in reading and 7 percent proficient in math , officials said			2
in a proposal based on federal guidelines , @entity11 asked teachers to work a longer school day of seven hours and tutor students weekly for one hour outside school time			1
she proposed teachers have lunch with students often , meet for 90 minutes every week to discuss education and set aside two weeks during summer break for paid professional development			1
a spokesman for the union said the teachers had accepted most of the changes , but wanted to work out compensation for the extra hours of work			1
the superintendent said the two sides could not agree on a pay rate			0
under new federal requirements for school reform , low - performing schools have several options			2
one is called the transformation model , which includes a series of changes that teachers agree to adopt. when the negotiations on those changes failed at @entity47 , the superintendent switched to another option : the turnaround model , which means firing every teacher at the troubled school			1
@entity102 , a teacher at @entity47 , said she 's disheartened			0
" i feel like , after 20 years , i can see some progress beginning to be made			0
and i 'm sad that we 're not going to be around to follow that through , to push that forward			0
" @entity11 , who said @entity2 law says notice must be given by march 1 , said the problem is n't solely the fault of teachers and it was n't her preference to make the move			2
she indicated that some of the teachers might be rehired			2
" when we had to move from the transformation model , the next best move was the turnaround model			0
and that requires us to remove the teachers and rehire , of those who reapply , up to 50 percent , " she said			2
" this is a major move , for a very significant reason , and that being that we could n't hone in on the assurances we needed for the transformation model			0
" asked what would happen if the teachers ' union accepted the original terms , @entity11 said it would be very difficult to go back , but ca n't be discounted			1
" and if ... as we move forward , if indeed something of that effect comes around , then i still think we have a lot of doors that could be opened			0
" at a community rally before the school board meeting on tuesday , supporters of the teachers slammed the plan			1
@entity141 , president of the @entity142 , said teachers have been unfairly targeted and scapegoated and the union will fight to have them reinstated			1
" we want genuine reforms , not quick fixes that do nothing but create a wedge between teachers , our school and our community , " said @entity141			1
she added that " teachers have agreed to numerous solutions and reforms			0
" @entity154 , a guidance counselor who was fired along with his wife , a chemistry teacher , said the school has been inaccurately cast as a place with low graduation rates			0
" we have the most transient population in this state			0
nobody comes close to us			0
so when they say that 50 percent of the people graduate , a very high percentage of our students leave our school			1
they go back to other countries , " he said , noting that three times as many of the school 's students are accepted to colleges now than they were five years ago			1
he also knocked the superintendent , saying she " has been with us for a little more than three years			0
" if @entity11 were willing to negotiate and listen to former sen. @entity179 , who has offered to mediate , " maybe we could resolve this instead of causing more trauma to us			0
" @entity154 said the negotiations were about job security , not pay , and said the teachers are ready to resume talks .			0
