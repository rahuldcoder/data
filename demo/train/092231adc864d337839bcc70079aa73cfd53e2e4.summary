the boys at @entity2 -- members and sponsors alike -- are in a big bind			1
nine years after i led an unsuccessful effort by the @entity7 to open membership in the club to women , the " woman problem " is back			1
this time it involves @entity13 , the first female chief executive of @entity14			2
@entity14 is a major sponsor of @entity2 's @entity15 , and up to now its ceos have always been given membership in the club			1
but none has ever been a woman			0
so what happens now -- will @entity2 open its doors to women ? or will @entity14 pull its sponsorship and force its other executives to resign their club memberships ? these are the only two real choices			1
we 've said all along that this is not about golf			0
it is about access to the places where big business is done , deals are made and careers are boosted or broken			0
half of @entity2 's membership ( which reads like a roster of @entity38 ) probably does n't even care about golf , but the members do care about power relationships			1
according to @entity46 , " golf remains the true communications hub of @entity45 's business elite			0
" back in 2003 when opposition to the all - male policy was making headlines , i got two calls from sponsors who said they were " in dialogue " with the club			0
the first was from @entity57 , saying its board was going to make a decision after talking to " @entity61 ( @entity62 ) and @entity63 ( @entity64 ) , " board members who were also @entity2 members			2
i was promised a call in the next two or three days			0
my second call was much more hostile			0
it was from @entity14 , telling me my organization was " forcing " them to do something they did n't want to do , and generally dressing me down for making an issue of the bald - faced sexism that their sponsorship supported			1
a few days later @entity75 , then chairman of @entity2 , stepped to a microphone and announced the club was releasing its sponsors , broadcasting the tournament without commercials			2
the boys had clearly made a deal that went like this : we 'll " release " you as sponsors , you 'll keep your mouths shut , and when all this woman stuff blows over you can quietly come back			2
two of the three did not return ( @entity14 was the exception ) , but none of the sponsors ever condemned the male - only policy at @entity2			1
@entity14 is surely scrambling for what it hopes will be another face - saving deal			2
the @entity98 senior golf columnist @entity97 predicts that club chairman @entity100 will offer @entity13 a membership a few days after the @entity15 ends next week : " she shows up at the tournament in 2013 in green , after the gender issue has died down			0
that way , the club avoids the appearance that @entity100 has been backed into a corner or forced into making an accommodation			0
" sorry , but that dog wo n't hunt			0
telling @entity13 to be a good girl and wait a little longer with @entity14 's collusion would be a disaster -- not only for the company 's image , but for @entity13 's credibility as its leader			1
@entity97 's scenario would scream that @entity14 values the relationship with a club that proudly discriminates more than it values its own integrity -- or its first female ceo			1
what if , on the other hand , @entity13 makes an announcement that she 's not interested in membership ? that wo n't work either			2
it would be widely assumed that she was under pressure from the company to make such a statement , and in the bargain accept her second - class status			0
after all , @entity133 ( male and female ) do n't get where they are by making waves			0
but fixing this should n't be put on her			0
it 's the responsibility of the board of directors to insist that their ceo be treated exactly like -- well -- one of the boys			1
besides , whether she would accept a membership is completely irrelevant to the question of the appropriateness of the club 's all - male policy and @entity14 's tacit support of it , and it does n't get the club out of its bind anyway			1
before she can reject a membership , she has to be offered one			0
if @entity2 admits it was prepared to make an offer but she would n't accept , it has admitted that membership is open to women , and it will immediately be asked who the next candidate will be and when			1
if the club remains silent , @entity14 's problem reverberates louder			1
and saying the gender issue will die down is wishful thinking			0
the women 's movement opened the doors to the executive suites for women like @entity13 with 30 years of hard work that made sex discrimination in hiring and promotion in corporate @entity45 illegal			2
if we had n't raised the ruckus in 2003 , you can bet it would n't be front and center now			0
and though we have n't succeeded yet , we wo n't stop until females are treated equally in corporate - supported venues like @entity2 , or until those companies are shamed into pulling support			1
if this were about race discrimination and a black ( male ) ceo , @entity14 surely would n't be in the mix , and no other national sponsor would go near this club			1
but it 's only the girls -- and sex discrimination is just not as serious			0
or is it ? we 're listening for @entity14 's answer			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			2

@entity198 : @entity2 , site of the *masters* , does n't admit women
but this year the ceo of @entity14 , a major sponsor whose ceos are given membership , is a woman
she says this puts @entity14 in a bind : should it ditch sponsorship if ceo not admitted ? she says yes
@entity198 : it 's @entity14 's directors ' responsibility to insist their ceo be treated like " one of the boys "
