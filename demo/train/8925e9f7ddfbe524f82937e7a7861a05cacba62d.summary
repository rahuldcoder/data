-- we know you do n't want to fly halfway around the world to eat a @entity4 but how about steamed cod with mustard sauce and chives , mixed vegetables , and parsley baby potatoes ? that , for instance , is what 's considered fast food in @entity14			1
when we think of fast food in the @entity16 , we imagine mega-chains with thousands of restaurants around the world -- too many , in fact , for the brands to have much quality control			1
but in some countries , such as @entity25 and @entity26 , the concept is just catching on , and the quality of the food you 'll find passing as " fast " is all the better for it			1
dining at white - table restaurants abroad is certainly a treat of travel ( if you can afford it ) , but if you really want a glimpse into local culture , there 's no better way than sampling the fare residents grab on the go			1
of course , it does n't hurt that the meals are as tasty as they are cheap			2
here , then , are our picks for the best foreign fast - food venues overseas			1
@entity43 : see the restaurants			2
@entity25 : @entity45 @entity46 : @entity47 topped with a fried egg ; black beans , white rice , and @entity52 fries on the side ( 10 reals , or about $ 6.50 ) many older and traditional @entity25 frown upon eating food with their hands , so when the @entity45 chain debuted in 1981 and became the first quick - service restaurant to hand out steel knives and forks , it caught on quickly			1
@entity45 now has 358 locations across @entity25			1
as at other fast - food joints , patrons at @entity45 pick up their orders from a counter , but food is usually presented on open plates , not in cardboard boxes , for guests eating in - house -- another acknowledgment of national preferences			1
@entity74 : mr. @entity75 @entity46 : beef noodle soup ( 13 yuan , or about $ 2 ) in @entity16 @entity79 restaurants , the menus are usually dominated by heavy fried - rice and lo - mein dishes , but in @entity74 simple noodle soup is the standard lunchtime fare			1
locals seem to especially love the options at mr. @entity75 , where patrons can customize their soup with condiments like dried - chili oil , soy sauce , white vinegar , and pickled greens			0
the soup is ordered from a counter and served in ceramic bowls , typically slurped standing up at the counter			0
the " @entity99 " chain was founded in 1987 by @entity100 , a @entity79 - @entity16 entrepreneur who previously created a chain of @entity103 restaurants in @entity104			0
the late mr. @entity100 's face is now emblazoned on restaurant storefronts in a style similar to @entity108 at @entity109			2
by 2010 , the homegrown chain had 400 locations in 19 provinces across @entity74			1
@entity43 : 10 coolest small towns in @entity16 @entity14 : @entity114 @entity46 : the @entity115 , with steamed codfish fillets in a mustard sauce with chives , mixed vegetables , and parsley baby potatoes ( 8 euros , or about $ 11.50 ) while @entity16 do n't usually think of steamed fish as a fast - food staple , most of the menu at fish - buffet chain @entity121 is made up of precisely that			1
@entity128 , plaice , pollock , salmon , and other fish are the stars of the show ( patrons choose whether they want the items steamed , grilled , or fried )			0
an emphasis is placed on fresh fish sourced from well - managed waters , catering to the @entity14 preference for healthy , sustainable food			1
the appeal , though , is more universal : the company , now with over 400 locations across @entity144 , is the @entity146 's largest chain specializing in seafood			2
@entity26 : @entity148 @entity46 : @entity149 rolls ; @entity150 ( 75 rupees , or about $ 1.65 ) and mixed vegetables ( 45 rupees , or about $ 1 ) are the two most popular fillings street - food stalls are a longtime standard in @entity26 , and most fast - food chains have struggled to compete there as a result			1
one of the first to break out , in 2004 , was @entity148 , which specializes in kaati rolls -- unleavened flat bread that 's been lightly fried and coated with egg , then stuffed with meat or vegetarian fillings and served with a side of fries sprinkled with tangy masala spices			2
( typically , one roll counts as a snack , two as a meal			0
) each @entity148 kitchen , restaurant , and kiosk has completely separate cooking and serving processes for vegetarian and meat dishes to accommodate local traditions			2
that kind of attention to detail may be why @entity148 caught on : the chain now has 15 locations , mostly in the city of @entity182 @entity183 : @entity184 @entity46 : @entity185 filled with red caviar or salmon roe ( 240 rubles , or about $ 8.30 ) founded in 1998 , @entity184 has spread to 111 restaurants and 80 street kiosks in @entity190 and @entity191			1
while soups , porridges , and salads all appear on the menu , it 's really all about the blinis			2
these thin , triangular - shaped , wheat pancakes are wrapped around various fillings ( sweet or savory ) and are baked to order at the counter in front of your eyes			0
in the @entity16 , we 're not used to thinking of this tasty dish as a fast - food item , but in @entity183 it 's available all day and evening			1
down it with some kvass , a low - alcohol drink made from rye flour with malt , or else some @entity213 ( a half litre of honey beer )			0
@entity43 : 10 popular travel scams around the world @entity218 : @entity219 @entity46 : the four - piece chicken meal ( mild or spicy ) with garlic sauce , @entity52 fries , and bread ( 12 riyal , or about $ 3.25 ) @entity219 was founded in 1974 in the @entity218 city of @entity225 and quickly became one of the most beloved fast - food chains in the @entity228			1
( you might have spotted the business - class travelers on @entity231 and @entity232 toting containers of @entity219 along with their duty - free shopping			0
) its claim to fame is its breaded chicken , which is pressure fried to keep the meat juicy			0
the enterprise has 46 permanent locations , which might sound like small potatoes , but when you consider how sparsely populated the @entity245 is , that 's a huge accomplishment			2
the chain is so popular that the company operates a pop - up restaurant once a year in @entity249 ( @entity250 ) , which caters to hundreds of thousands of prayerful @entity251 a day while they attend @entity252 , a five - day religious pilgrimage that usually takes place in the fall			0
one passing observation : only men are allowed to work behind the counters , in deference to local custom			2
@entity261 : @entity262 @entity46 : " @entity271 grilled " kaya ( coconut jam ) toast with slices of butter , a soft - boiled egg , and a mug of kopi ( coffee ) ( @entity261 $ 2.50 , or about $ 2 @entity16 ) founded in @entity261 in 2005 , breakfast - and - lunch purveyor @entity262 now has more than 30 locations in the city - state and 12 elsewhere in @entity275 and the @entity276 , including @entity277 , @entity278 , and the @entity279			0
but the dish it specializes in has been served locally by roadside kopitiams ( or coffee stands ) since the 1920s			0
@entity262 brandishes one major weapon in the toast - and - spread war against longstanding roadside rivals : it has its employees dress in blue - and - white striped caps and aprons -- a direct appeal to @entity261 ' delight in snappy uniforms			0
yet @entity262 wisely retains the familiar touches of a traditional kopitiam , such as @entity297 tabletops and natural wood decor			0
@entity43 : 12 restaurants with spectacular views @entity300 : steers @entity46 : rib burger and chips ( 32.95 rand , or about $ 4.50 ) when @entity305 's came to @entity300 in 1995 , locals laughed at its @entity4 ; those three ounces of meat looked pretty puny next to the offering from local chain steers : the @entity311 burger , which packs seven ounces of beef			1
in red - blooded , meat - loving @entity300 , offering burgers of that magnitude is a sure way to gain fans			0
steers has since maintained dominance as the national brand of choice , with 483 locations in @entity300 today			0
reminiscent of the @entity325 's chain in the @entity16 , steers provides quick service and comfort food in a sit - down setting , though its restaurants also have to - go and drive - through menus			1
burgers are the main item on offer , but pork riblets are a close second , served on a bun , as a rack , or as cut pieces			0
