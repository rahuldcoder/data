-- @entity1 know their push to try to force a vote in the @entity5 - led @entity4 is n't going anywhere			1
but that 's not the point			0
it 's an election year and @entity1 believe blaming republicans for failing to address the issue will put them on the defensive in november			2
@entity4 @entity1 filed what is known as a " discharge petition " on wednesday			1
if they get a majority of members to sign it , @entity5 leaders must put the @entity20 bill increasing the minimum wage from $ 7.25 to $ 10.10 an hour on the floor			1
even if all 199 @entity4 @entity1 signed the petition , it would take roughly 18 republicans to defy their leaders and press for a vote			1
aides from both parties -- and even some republicans who say they could support some increase to the minimum wage - acknowledge that is n't going to happen			2
but with most the heavy legislative lifting essentially done for the year , democrats want the debate over whether to raise the minimum wage to be a key part of their strategy to defeat @entity5 members			1
at a retreat earlier this month to map out plans for the year , the @entity4 @entity20 campaign chief , rep. @entity41 of @entity42 , said the november election will come down to voters deciding on the question , " whose side are you on ? " @entity1 believe fighting for a higher minimum wage demonstrates they care about working @entity51			1
@entity5 argue a wage hike would lead to fewer jobs and actually hurt @entity51			2
@entity5 lawmakers and aides say so far the issue has n't been a top concern of voters , and they insist the november elections will hinge on the sluggish economy and problems their constituents are having dealing with the implementation of the new health care law known as @entity66			0
but the minimum wage issue could prove tricky for republicans in the fall			1
even though @entity73 is n't likely to pass anything this year , a recent @entity72 / @entity71 poll showed that nearly two thirds of those @entity51 surveyed support boosting the minimum wage			2
the same poll found 77 % of @entity1 backed increasing the federal minimum wage level to $ 10.10 per hour and nearly half of @entity5 surveyed also supported raising it to that level			1
@entity83 says republicans are on the wrong side of public opinion			0
" middle class security is the fundamental issue of this election and @entity4 @entity5 are going to have to go home to their districts and explain to voters why they protected billions in subsidies for big oil companies but they wo n't give @entity51 's middle class a raise , " @entity83 said in a statement to @entity0			2
both sides are pointing to a report released earlier this month by the non-partisan @entity99			0
@entity5 emphasize that it found that mandating a federal minimum wage of $ 10.10 in the next two years would cost the economy 500,000 jobs			1
@entity1 are highlighting the part of the report that said increasing the pay rate would help lift 900,000 @entity51 out of poverty			2
any momentum @entity1 hoped to generate could be blunted by senate majority leader @entity109 's decision this week to delay a vote on the issue until later this spring			2
but an event inside the @entity113 on wednesday with business leaders and advocates pushing for a higher wage rate was aimed at voters around the country , not at lawmakers			0
it 's a continuation of the political message president @entity122 has been pushing -- that @entity1 are committed to eliminating income inequality			0
@entity122 recently signed an executive order upping the minimum rate for federal contractors to $ 10.10 an hour			1
" not to have this vote is to abdicate our responsibility that we have to the middle class , the backbone of our democracy			0
mr. speaker , give us a vote ! " @entity4 minority leader @entity135 said at the rally			0
at their weekly @entity20 caucus meeting , two top @entity4 aides huddled with @entity4 @entity1 to provide statistics and fact sheets they could use at home to demonstrate the economic impact of raising the minimum wage			1
over the coming months , members are planning events in their districts to highlight their efforts to push @entity5 leaders for a vote			0
@entity20 candidates will point to the discharge petition in @entity152 and accuse @entity4 @entity5 of blocking a vote on a higher minimum wage			1
one moderate @entity5 , @entity155			0
@entity156 , who has been targeted by @entity1 in the last several election cycles , told @entity0 he was open to raising the minimum wage			1
he pointed out that he voted in favor the last time @entity73 upped it in 2007			0
but he said if @entity73 acts again , any increase should be paired with other measures that boost job creation			0
another @entity5 member , @entity164 rep. @entity163 , says he 's willing to debate whether it makes sense to raise the minimum wage			1
but " i also really recognize that all the @entity1 are trying to do is go like look the shiny red ball - look over here while we have a terrible economy , " he said			0
@entity163 said he wo n't sign the discharge petition and dismissed it as a political move , telling @entity0 that " it 's an attempt to create a pressure point			0
" @entity5 argue the @entity20 focus on the minimum wage proves their point -- that the president 's domestic program has kept the economy in a stalled state			2
" the @entity20 policies are keeping people in minimum wage jobs , or worse , costing our economy jobs as @entity66 is doing , " @entity4 @entity5 campaign chief @entity183 said in a written statement to @entity0			1
he said @entity5 will respond to @entity20 attacks by talking about their proposals to shift people into better paying jobs that lead to greater opportunities and long term stability			0
pressed on whether using the discharge petition was simply to make a political point , @entity195 chairman @entity194 told @entity0 said it comes down to a question a fairness			0
" if you work in @entity51 you should be paid decently and if you work for the minimum wage you deserve a pay raise			1
we 're interested in having a jobs agenda it would be great if @entity5 would join us in that , " he said .			0

@entity1 *opt* for *procedural* maneuver to try to get @entity4 vote on the issue
they want to raise the minimum wage from $ 7.25 to $ 10.10 per hour
@entity1 want debate over a wage hike to be a key part of their campaign strategy
