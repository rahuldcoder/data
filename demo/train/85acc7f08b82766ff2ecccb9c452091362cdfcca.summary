-- every four years , @entity2 audiences are re-introduced to all manner of lesser known sports : fencing , handball , even ones they may have tried themselves , like trampoline			2
but there 's one sport that many @entity2 are familiar with that used to be in the @entity11 , until it got the boot nearly a century ago			1
according to the @entity14 , tug - of - war was an @entity11 sport from 1900 to 1920 , and the @entity2 actually swept all three medals in 1904 when the games were held in @entity18			1
these days , most people do n't think of tug - of - war as the domain of @entity11 athletes			1
it has the reputation of being a playground pursuit for children or the occasional team - building exercise			2
but an international governing body , the @entity28 , has more than 60 member associations worldwide , and annual world championships are held for both indoor and outdoor events			0

@entity38 , the president of the @entity39 , says the sport these days is played mostly in @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , though she has been contacted by people all over the country about setting up teams and competitions			0
there are officially sanctioned events held in the summer months in those states , and a national championship held each year , most recently in @entity53 , @entity42 , on july 21			0
teams from the @entity2 have competed well worldwide			0
in 2004 , the @entity2 women won gold at the world championships , and @entity38 says the current teams continue to be among the best in the world			0
as for returning to the @entity11 , that 's a different matter entirely			1
the most recent discussions between the @entity34 and the @entity2 @entity64 association were nearly a decade ago , when the organization was told would need to grow considerably in terms of funding and participation			0
@entity69 , a spokesman for the @entity34 , tells @entity0 he is not aware of any future plans for the @entity34 to be involved with @entity28			0
as for international competition , @entity38 says the @entity14 is slated to meet with @entity28 to reopen discussions about potential inclusion in the @entity74			0
that conversation is slated for 2020 , and the earliest you would see the sport back in the @entity11 is 2024 , she says			1
according to the @entity28 's annual meeting notes from 2011 , officials have had preliminary discussions with the @entity14			0
on the @entity14 's site , however , it says for a summer sport to be included into the @entity11 format it " must be widely practised ( by men , in 75 countries on four continents ; by women , in 40 countries and on three continents )			1
" there is one other obstacle to tug of war -- or any sport being add to the competition			2
the @entity11 charter only allows for 28 sports at the @entity98			1
with the re-inclusion of golf and ruby union at the @entity74 , the program would be full			2
some sports federations hoping for inclusion into the @entity105 will be asked to make presentations to the @entity14 in 2013 .			2
