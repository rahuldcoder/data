-- what started out as @entity3 's worst season since owner @entity4 arrived in 2003 is now on the verge of becoming one of the @entity8 club 's best			1
saturday 's @entity15 final success , the @entity11 side 's fourth in six years in the world 's oldest football competition , is the latest step in a revival that could end in the realization of the @entity21 billionaire 's longheld dream			1
the nailbiting 2 - 1 victory at @entity23 is but a tasty precursor to a @entity26 final in @entity27 on may 19 that offers the chance for @entity4 to finally win @entity30 's top club prize			1
he brought @entity33 success to @entity34 in 2005 after spending millions on coach @entity35 and a swathe of star players , achieving @entity3 's first @entity8 title in 50 years			2
two more followed , but not before @entity35 departed after failing to repeat the @entity40 triumph at @entity41 that earned @entity4 's attention -- and @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 also exited as @entity26 success proved elusive			0
@entity47 , " the new @entity35 , " was bought out of his contract at @entity41 to replace @entity45 -- a @entity40 champion as both player and coach -- but the @entity52 prodigy alienated @entity3 's powerful old guard of players as he sought to stamp his authority and rebuild the squad			0
his assistant @entity57 , a former @entity3 player himself , has had no such problems winning their respect as he has reverted to the style so successful under @entity35 , allowing the likes of veterans @entity62 and @entity64 to restore their pre-eminent roles in the team			2
@entity64 scored the vital winner in the first leg of the remarkable @entity26 semifinal success against arguably the world 's best team , @entity70 , and he netted the ultimately decisive second goal against @entity73			1
the 34 - year - old @entity75 captain is now the only player to score in four @entity15 finals , equaling the five goals in total scored by legendary @entity73 striker @entity79 in three title matches			2
@entity64 may yet make his @entity3 exit after the @entity83 clash in two weeks ' time -- a match which not only holds the key to @entity4 's hopes , but could also be part of a solution to the challenges the club faces under @entity40 soccer 's new financial fair play rules			1
each team will get a reported $ 66 million for making the final , when television money is added to the prize total on offer , representing a major budgetary boost for a club like @entity3 -- which under the new regulations can no longer rely on @entity4 's deep pockets			2
@entity3 's bid to become more financially self - sufficient took another step ahead of saturday 's final , with news the club is seeking to buy the nearby iconic @entity107 power station and turn it into a new home ground with capacity greater than the present one			1
the $ 2.9 million earned by winning the @entity15 final for the seventh time will also help , as well as furthering the prospects of @entity114 being made @entity3 's permanent manager			1
@entity117 midfielder @entity116 followed up his second - leg goal against @entity70 with the opening strike in the 11th minute as he beat goalkeeper @entity120 at the near post with a low shot			0
@entity64 doubled the lead seven minutes after halftime , but @entity73 substitute @entity125 ensured a nervy finish after reducing the deficit on 64			1
the striker -- who has struggled since joining @entity73 for a club - record $ 50 million fee in january 2011 after @entity131 left for @entity3 for $ 30 million more than that -- thought he had leveled the scores with a late header			1
however , @entity3 keeper @entity135 clawed the ball clear off the underside of the crossbar apparently before it had crossed the line -- much to the disgust of @entity73 striker @entity141 , who was booked for remonstrating with the line official			2
" we 've been heavily criticised this season and we 've got a trophy and we 've got the chance for another , " said @entity114 , who scored in two @entity15 final wins for @entity3 in 1997 and 2000			0
" this group of players have made the club proud			0
it 's been hard work , but we came through it			0
" @entity73 will play in @entity30 next season , albeit the second - tier @entity156 after winning the @entity157 in february , but it has been an otherwise disappointing season under manager @entity159			0
the 18 - time @entity8 champions trail sixth - placed @entity3 by 12 points with two games to play in the @entity33 , a situation which can not please the club 's @entity165 owners -- who are looking to emulate the success they have had with baseball 's @entity170			1
" they were better than us for the first hour , " @entity159 said after the final			0
" we finished really strong and if we 'd started the way we 'd finished we 'd maybe have been happier than we are now			0
we 've just got to learn the lessons			0
" @entity4 's hopes of @entity26 football next season , meanwhile , appear to rest solely on victory in @entity27 , despite a slip - up by third - placed @entity11 rivals @entity182 on saturday			1
@entity182 's 3 - 3 draw with @entity184 gave @entity185 and @entity186 the chance to move up to third and fourth with victories on sunday			0
spurs , who hold the edge on goal difference only , face relegation - threatened @entity193 while the in - form @entity194 will seek to follow up wednesday 's 2 - 0 win over @entity3 with another result against league leaders @entity198			1
both clubs are five points clear of @entity3 , but know that the fourth - placed team will be bumped down to the @entity156 if @entity4 gets what he really wants in @entity203			0
@entity198 returned to the top on goal difference with a 1 - 0 win in monday 's @entity208 derby , but second - placed local rivals @entity209 have easier opposition on sunday as the defending champions host mid-table @entity212 .			2

@entity3 win @entity214 for the seventh time , beating @entity73 2 - 1 in saturday 's final
@entity116 and @entity64 score in each half before @entity125 reduces the deficit
substitute @entity125 goes close to equalizer as his header is cleared from under the bar
@entity226 boosts @entity3 ahead of @entity26 final in @entity27 on may 19
