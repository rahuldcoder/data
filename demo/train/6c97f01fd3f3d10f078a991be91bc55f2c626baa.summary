@entity0 -- on the eve of the 12th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , @entity3 @entity2 is questioning why none of the city 's mayoral candidates has requested a briefing from the @entity11 about its counterterrorism program , strategies or tactics			1
he told an audience that even though the threat of terror in @entity0 is as substantial as ever , mayoral candidates have yet to meet with him about their plans for fighting terrorism in @entity23 's largest city			1
" the threat of terrorism is as great , if not greater , today than it was before the @entity28 was destroyed , " @entity2 said monday , speaking in front of the @entity25 for a better @entity0 and @entity26			1
" yet i can tell you that none of the candidates has requested a briefing from the @entity33 on this topic			0
i believe the public has a right to ask them some important questions			0
" @entity2 noted that in the past 10 months , at least five terror plots against @entity0 were foiled , including the potential attack by the @entity42 bombing brothers had they not been captured			1
" what is their understanding of the terrorist threat to @entity0 and its immediacy ? what is their perspective on the role the @entity11 should play in protecting @entity0 from global terrorism ? will they expend their political capital and continue to fight in @entity55 , for the federal funds we need to maintain our defenses ? " @entity2 asked			1
the city 's primary election for mayor is taking place tuesday			0
a spokesman for @entity64 , the mayoral front - runner garnering 39 % of @entity67 primary voters , according to a @entity69 poll released monday , told @entity1 that @entity64 requested a counterterrorism briefing on august 29			1
" @entity64 believes there is nothing more important than protecting @entity0 from the threat of terror and keeping @entity0 safe			1
after the president 's remarks on @entity79 , the office requested a briefing from the @entity11 on the city 's counter-terror efforts and is working with @entity83 to schedule it , " @entity75 , press secretary for @entity64 , told @entity1 on monday			2
@entity85 , who is receiving 25 % of the @entity67 vote , according to the poll , did not respond to @entity1 's request for comment			0
on his campaign website , @entity85 says he plans to enhance and establish security measures to protect roads , bridges and tunnels from terror			1

" @entity104 addresses counterterrorism in her platform for mayor			0
according to the @entity69 poll , @entity108 has 18 % of the vote among @entity67			0
" @entity104 is the speaker of the @entity112 , and as part of her day - to - day job helping run this city , she has conversations and briefings regularly with the @entity11 on everything from crime to counterterrorism , " @entity111 , a spokesman for @entity108 , said monday			1
" in the course of this campaign , she has been advised by and consulted with numerous officials in the @entity11 and with anti-terrorism experts because she knows the single most important responsibility for the mayor of @entity0 is keeping the public safe			2
" @entity108 has called for more city employees to be trained in counterterrorism tactics , including sanitation and transit workers , making them a bigger part of the surveillance program			0
she also proposed a review of @entity0 infrastructure that could be vulnerable to terror attacks , including metal trash cans , and said the @entity11 should be more closely engaged with universities to design curricula to " fight crimes of the future			2
" in his speech , @entity2 emphasized the public 's responsibility to inquire about the future of @entity0 's safety and push beyond complacency			0
" the public should demand detailed answers from the candidates about their plans to protect @entity0			2
we 've come too far and we 've sacrificed too much to leave ourselves vulnerable			0
