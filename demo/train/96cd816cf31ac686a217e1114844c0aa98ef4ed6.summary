-- you 've heard the saying : " in war , amateurs talk strategy , professionals talk logistics			0
" the political equivalent : " amateurs talk ideology -- professionals talk interest groups			0
" small but sophisticated interest groups use big political battles to gain special advantages			0
health care reform is , of course , the biggest battle of them all , with trillions of dollars at stake			0
on saturday night with the @entity24 vote in favor of the health reform bill , the trial lawyers sliced themselves a nice little piece of that bonanza			1
it 's @entity30 of the bill -- to be precise @entity30 ( 4 ) b -- and it provides as follows : the new health bill will empower the @entity34 to make grants to states that reform their medical malpractice systems			1
there are just two conditions : those reforms must not " limit attorneys ' fees or impose caps on damages			2
" which is like saying that we 're going to encourage you to develop a personal weight loss plan that includes neither exercise nor changes in diet			0
here 's how @entity30 works			0
over the past decade and a half , states have reacted to abusive lawsuits by imposing various restrictions on personal injury awards			1
in @entity60 , pain and suffering damages can not exceed $ 250,000			0
attorneys may collect no more than 15 percent of malpractice awards over $ 600,000			0
the impact of these kinds of reforms can be dramatic			0
after @entity68 capped pain and suffering damages at $ 750,000 in 2003 , the number of malpractice lawsuits dropped abruptly			1
lawsuits in @entity70 ( @entity71 and environs ) plunged by 50 percent			2
fewer lawsuits meant lower malpractice premiums			2
@entity68 ' largest malpractice insurance carrier cut costs to doctors by 17 percent			1
lower insurance premiums attracted more medical professionals to the state			2
in the 1990s , @entity68 ranked low in the nation in the number of doctors per person			1
in the four years after 2003 , the number of doctors in the state jumped by 18 percent			1
" it was hard to believe at first , we thought it was a spike , " the executive director of the states ' medical board told the @entity92			2
@entity68 ' experience is dramatic , but consistent , with other reforming states			1
states with damage caps gain more doctors than uncapped states -- and the difference is greatest in the most underserved counties within capped states			1
capped states have 5.5 percent more @entity102 per person in their rural counties than do states without caps			2
but the money saved by insurers , doctors and their customers is money subtracted from the pockets of trial lawyers -- and those lawyers carry real clout in the @entity115			1
the trial lawyers ' national pac , the @entity118 , was the second - biggest source of @entity116 dollars for @entity115 candidates in the 2006 election year : almost $ 2.6 million			1
that same year , @entity123 's trial lawyers elected a former president of their association to @entity115			1
had the @entity126 been less inquiring , a former trial lawyer named @entity129 might well be serving as attorney general right now			0
@entity131 once summed up the professional politicians ' credo : " those who support me early will have my close attention when i win office			0
those who support me late will have my attention when i win office			0
and those who oppose me -- " and here he 'd wink -- " they 'll get good government			0
" we all know what long meant by " close attention , " and his old party apparently still lives by his rules			0
on saturday , @entity24 @entity150 have delivered some very " close attention " to their friends in the trial bar			1
the question is : who will stand up for good government for the rest of us ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			2

the @entity24 bill passed saturday night *protects* the fees of trial lawyers , @entity159 says
he says states that have capped fees have seen increase in doctors
when @entity68 capped fees , lawsuits fell and doctors moved to the state , he says
@entity176 : trial lawyers are benefiting because they provide campaign *funds* for *democrats*
