@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 will hold a general election on march 4 next year , the country 's @entity4 chairman @entity3 announced saturday			1
the vote will be the first since ethnic violence followed disputed elections four years ago and left more than 1,000 people dead and 350,000 displaced , according to the @entity1 @entity12			1
in that election , both @entity13 , the incumbent , and challenger @entity15 claimed to have won			0
the post-election chaos escalated into ethnic violence with members of the president 's tribe , the @entity20 , fighting members of @entity15 's @entity24 tribe and other groups			1
the two later entered into a power - sharing agreement , with @entity15 named prime minister and @entity13 named president			1
setting the date for new elections has been a contentious process			0
under the old constitution , the president had the power to dissolve parliament after which the electoral body would announce the election date			2
but under the new constitution , agreed in 2010 , the election date is already set -- it 's in august , every five years			2
however , because @entity1 is in a unique situation -- it has a coalition government following the 2007 disputed elections -- the president and prime minister have to agree on when to dissolve the coalition parliament to pave way for the electoral body to set an election date			1
this scenario generated ambiguity as to when the next general election would be held , which led a group of @entity1 to move to the high court			1
the court ruling gave two options			0
one was that the president and prime minister agree on a date to dissolve the coalition , allowing the election to be called			1
the second was to wait for the lapse of the current parliamentary term , which is january 14 , 2013 , and then hold the election within 60 days after that , as set out in the law			0
since the president and prime minister could not reach agreement , with the president favoring the second option and the prime minister keen to see a 2012 election , the @entity4 opted to take the second option			2
@entity15 's political party , the @entity72 , had urged the commission to set a date in december this year			0
the commission " should avoid any temptation of serving any sectarian interests through extension of the life of the coalition government , " the party said in a statement			2
a december date was the preferred option of the majority of the @entity1 people and would be in line with the high court ruling and a recommendation by the @entity91 , the party said			2
@entity1 will be keen to avoid any repeat of the violence that swept the country four years ago			0
in january , the @entity95 ruled that four @entity1 officials , including deputy prime minister @entity97 , will stand trial on human rights violations that are alleged to have occurred after the 2007 election			1
@entity97 and cabinet secretary @entity101 are accused of crimes against humanity			0
former agriculture minister @entity104 and radio journalist @entity105 face similar charges			0
the men named by the @entity95 come from opposite sides of the disputed 2007 election			0

the general election will be the first since a disputed vote in 2007 *resulted* in ethnic violence
@entity1 is currently run by a coalition government after a power - sharing deal
@entity1 's prime minister *wanted* an earlier election date
