-- scores of people died thursday in and around the restive @entity4 city of @entity5 , activists said , corroborating reports of widespread casualties a day after the start of a new military clampdown targeting protesters			1
at least 109 people died in and around @entity5 , said @entity13 , a global activist group , citing a medical source			1
the @entity16 said 30 people were killed wednesday			2
" the brutality continues in @entity5 on the fourth day of @entity19			1
communication with the city and surrounding area is very difficult as the electricity supply has been cut off , " @entity13 said			2
the activist group , citing the medical source , said scores more were wounded			1
" bodies are lying in the streets as ambulances and private vehicles are unable to get through , " the group said			1
the western @entity4 city is the center of the country 's anti-government movement , whose efforts have prompted a crackdown by security personnel on the huge demonstrations there in an effort to secure the city			1
citing the medical source , @entity13 said bodies taken to @entity46 had been shot at close range , most of them in the head			2
the geographic breakdown was 48 dead in the town of @entity54 , 31 in the town of @entity56 , and 30 in the northern part of @entity5 and the @entity59 area , it said			1
one resident who spoke to @entity0 by satellite phone said some of the casualties who were taken to hospitals died there because the facilities were without electricity			2
there were reports of a breakdown and cutoff in communications and electricity accompanying the siege , and of the military bombing the city			1
the resident said entrances of the city were blocked , with no one getting in or out , and snipers were stationed across the city			0
people who tried to leave , he said , were being shot			0
the man said about 10 people had been killed and dozens more were wounded			0
@entity5 , which has seen massive demonstrations by anti-government protesters , was the site of the 1982 bloody crackdown by the @entity91 - dominated government against a @entity93 uprising			1
memories of that siege , carried out by late president @entity96 , the father of president @entity97 , have reverberated during the nearly five - month uprising , and the ongoing violence in @entity5 has prompted international anger against the @entity97 regime			1
reports of violence also emanated from the capital			1
four people who were at @entity106 in @entity107 in the suburbs of @entity109 offered separate but similar accounts			0
one of the sources is a representative of the @entity113 , an opposition group			2
two of the others were among the protesters			0
after prayers , worshipers exited the rear of the mosque to join an anti-government demonstration , but were met by about 24 thugs -- men in civilian clothes armed with guns and batons , the sources told @entity0 in telephone interviews			0
the men fired into the air and beat some of the worshipers as they left the buildings , the sources said			0
upon reaching @entity107 , where they chanted for freedom and the fall of the regime , they were set upon by gunmen and others who threw rocks at them			0
at that point , the demonstrators returned to the mosque and closed themselves inside , the sources said			0
a few militia members entered the front yard of the mosque carrying batons and stun guns and attacked the protesters who were there , the sources said			0
the protesters were allowed safe passage out of the mosque after they promised to end their protests , the sources said			0
but the protesters were expected to resume friday , when rebels said the theme would be " @entity160 is with @entity161			1
" @entity0 is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in @entity4 , which has restricted access to the country by international journalists , including @entity0 's			2
the move came a day after the @entity168 issued a presidential statement condemning the @entity4 government 's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties			1
but @entity176 on thursday slammed the council 's response as " completely inadequate " and " limp " because it failed to take action			1
the council issued a presidential statement , which carries no enforcement weight			2
" it 's crucial that a @entity187 fact - finding mission to @entity4 is able to investigate the situation as soon as possible , " said @entity183 , @entity176 's representative to the @entity184			1
" unfortunately , the @entity168 has also failed to provide support for such a mission			0
" he noted that @entity4 authorities have not permitted a @entity184 fact - finding delegation into the country to investigate the situation			1
" the @entity184 must act now , with a firm and legally binding position			1
at the very least , its position must include imposing an arms embargo , freezing the assets of president @entity97 and other officials suspected of responsibility for crimes against humanity , and referring the situation to the @entity209 prosecutor , " he said , in reference to the @entity209			0
two permanent members of the @entity168 weighed in on how to proceed			0
the @entity214 said @entity4 's citizens should solve their problems themselves , state - run @entity213 said			2
" the settlement in this country should be carried out by the @entity4 themselves without outside interference and should be based on an all - @entity4 dialogue , which is the only way to resolve the conflict , " the ministry said in a statement			2
but later thursday , @entity213 said that @entity226 president @entity225 told reporters that he had told @entity97 during meetings and in letters that " it is necessary to hold a referendum , put up with the opposition , restore peace and create a modern state			1
" @entity225 added that if @entity97 were to fail , he would be destined to " a sad fate , and ultimately we will also have to make some kind of decisions			1
" @entity240 foreign minister @entity239 said thursday that the @entity168 may take a tougher stance on @entity4 " if nothing changes on the @entity4 side			0
" the @entity244 , an activist group , issued on thursday an update about @entity246 , a city in the country 's northeastern region			1
it said an opposition leader in the city reported that the government had launched a series of measures to punish residents			0
they include not paying government employees , halting wheat deliveries to bakeries , preventing hospitals from rescuing wounded protesters , and asking governmental medical staff to leave their posts			0
some pharmacists have closed their shops over fears that they will be detained for giving medications to wounded protesters			0
meanwhile , @entity97 has issued a decree authorizing a multiple - party political system , state media reported thursday			0
@entity4 lawmakers had already passed a law granting citizens the right to establish political parties with the aim of contributing to political life " through peaceful and democratic means , " the state - run @entity270 reported			0
however , the @entity4 opposition has argued the decrees are intended for show and will not effect real change			0
that 's because it is questionable whether the move , absent constitutional reform , could end decades of single - party @entity289 rule			1
one of the articles of the @entity4 constitution guarantees supremacy for the ruling @entity294 party			0
@entity0 's @entity295 and @entity296 contributed to this story			2

new : friday 's theme will be " @entity160 is with @entity161 "
@entity225 calls for reform or " we also will have to make some kind of decisions "
an activist group reports more than 100 deaths in and around @entity5
@entity176 slams the @entity184 ' statement
