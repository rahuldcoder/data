@entity0 -- @entity2 has one of the oldest food cultures in the world and , like that acme of @entity11 food culture @entity9 cuisine , the food needs to be fresh			1
at @entity13 , a remote town in western @entity15 , a live goose will cost you little more than $ us3 a bird			2
" they 're 18 kwai a piece , " said one market trader , using the @entity2 vernacular for the renminbi , @entity2 's currency , and pointing to her gaggle of geese honking furiously at one end of a bamboo pen			1
" buy it now and they 'll cook it for you , " she added , pointing down the road to a small stall doing a brisk business serving a lunchtime crowd of pavement diners			0
in southern @entity2 , it 's said that people will eat everything with four legs except for the table			1
whether it 's a chicken , a goose or even a frog , if its heart is still just beating by the time you get it home , all the better			0
it may taste delicious ; but the way the birds are handled , stored and slaughtered has the potential to make you very sick			2
it 's no accident , then , that @entity2 's public health authorities are now proactively targeting small towns and villages , taking throat swabs from live food dealers and their customers in wet markets where the rough and ready food culture provides a perfect environment for viruses -- such as @entity63 bird flu -- to flourish			1
as with all things in @entity2 , the scale of the undertaking is witheringly massive			2
@entity2 's @entity67 , says its medical dragnet has taken samples from poultry markets , farms and slaughterhouses across the country			1
so far , 84,444 samples have been taken , 47,801 have been tested and 39 samples confirmed as @entity63 positive			2
of these , 38 positive samples came from live poultry markets in the @entity79 municipality and @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity83 provinces			1
one sample , worryingly , was found in a feral pigeon ; an indication of the virus 's ability to spread undetected in wild species			0
" basically , at the moment poultry seems to be the source of the virus so there 's a risk if there 's direct contact with the poultry or indirect contact with the fecal matter or other products			2
of course , if the food is being cooked properly then the risk is limited , " said dr. @entity103 - man , associate professor , at the @entity105 at the @entity106			0
while the @entity108 has not established a direct link , medical investigators are concentrating their efforts on @entity2 's poultry farms and vendors			1
" that is the reality , " he said			0
" that is what we learned from @entity120 , " he added , referring to the outbreak of the bird flu virus in @entity0 in 1997 that killed six and left 18 seriously ill. like most of @entity2 , @entity0 back then liked its chickens fresh			1
poultry in bamboo cages on street corners was a common sight and grandmothers could be regularly seen blowing on chickens ' anuses -- a common local method of checking the bird 's cloaca to gauge its age			2
all of these practices have ended in @entity0			0
after 1997 , millions of poultry were slaughtered and hundreds of vendors put out of business			0
according to @entity139 , reducing the risk in any market place is not just a matter of improving hygiene , restricting transport and creating overnight " rest days " are all ways of bringing down the viral load in @entity2 's ubiquitous wet markets			1
" once a month we leave a day that allows the poultry to sleep and then on that day we have a very thorough cleaning procedure of the market , " @entity139 said , adding that the almost 24/7 nature of many market places in @entity2 made it difficult for health authorities to break the cycle of the virus			1
" basically , we come up with a package -- we need more than one single measure to reduce the risk , " he added			0
virologists , meanwhile , are now looking at how viruses pass , not just from animals to humans , but from humans to animals and then back to humans again			0
according to professor @entity169 , head of the @entity170 at @entity106 , the spread of disease does not just work in one direction			0
he said that dangerous outbreaks of epidemics such as @entity174 and bird flu are a wake - up call , demonstrating that the fate of humans is inextricably linked with that of the animals we raise and eat			1
" it reminds us that human health and veterinary health are one and the same thing and we need to be constantly vigilant , " he said			0
" we are linked to animals not just by contact but also by the food chain			0

@entity2 cuisine demands that food be as fresh as possible
but *problems* arise with the way live poultry is handled , stored and slaughtered
