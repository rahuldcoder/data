@entity0 , @entity1 -- walk the halls of @entity0 and you 're bound to bump into celebrities , heads of state and even princes and princesses			1
this is where you can be seen , be heard and be indulged			2
the @entity13 's little white book which provides contacts for each attendee is the best business bible around			1
but you do n't need to hang around the halls or wait to stake out your favorite executive to get their contact			0
the best way to network here is to take the shuttle			1
it 's free , it 's warm and -- being @entity1 -- it always arrives on time			1
inside , the six - seater bus has been made for interaction , with passengers facing each other			1
with eye to eye contact and closed doors , they are forced to engage in conversation			0
i have been taking the shuttle since saturday , and on each occasion , i have made small talk with the passengers			1
of course , i am always the one to instigate it , but it does just take one person to get the conversation flowing			0
on wednesday night , post dinner , i met the @entity47 of the @entity48 in @entity49			0
last night , i was lucky to start a conversation with the head of @entity52 's			1
the beauty of the shuttle is that no one knows anyone , so conversation normally begins with " are you enjoying @entity0 ? when did you get here ? "			1
@entity60 through the journey , if you 're lucky enough to be stuck in traffic , then will you get into the most important question : " what do you do ? "			0
that 's when i smile and they frown			2
i get excited that i have met a ceo , a vice president or the head of an @entity71			0
they are disappointed that i 'm a journalist			0
i 'm quick to tell them that i 'm not working and that everything is off the record			0
in cases such as this , when you have all of five minutes , it 's crucial that you show your journalistic integrity and present them with a picture of a person rather than a journalist			2
i always think to myself : " do n't force it , be natural			0
" this attitude has enabled to me make more contacts than on any other occasion			2
during a half hour shuttle journey on thursday , i met a @entity91 hedge fund manager , the chairman and ceo of @entity93 , the vp of a @entity96 bank and many many more fascinating people			2
in true traditional networking style , they exit with well wishes and all , without exception , hand out their business cards			0
so forget @entity103 -- come to @entity0 and the shuttle .			1

the six - seater shuttle buses at @entity0 are the best way to meet fellow attendees
seats face each other so passengers tend to make small - talk
the shuttles have provided an *excellent* point of *introduction* to @entity117 , says @entity2 's @entity118
