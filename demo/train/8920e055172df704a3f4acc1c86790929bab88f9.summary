@entity9 , who is a member of @entity11 's executive committee , said those responsible were " shaming the human race " but that whatever the provocation it was better to rise above it by showing quality on the football pitch			1
" it might not be a solution to leave the field			0
it 's a gut reaction really			0
it 's very bad for a player , " he said			2
" you must play beautiful soccer and help your team score goals and this will show really the equality between white and black and it would put an end to the problem			0
" so i believe that to leave the field is not enough			0
it 's better to stay , make more effort , resist this insult and show that you are capable of doing very good things			0
" @entity9 's remarks come in the aftermath of a walk off by @entity45 's @entity44 -- subjected to racist abuse while playing a friendly match against a lower division side in @entity49			1

so what will we do ? " we will do everything			0
i believe only small fines are not enough			0
we need to find other punishments in order to deter these people who are shaming the human race , " he added			0

he wants the world governing body , led by @entity73 , to take a " collective decision " to deal with the racism problem , but believes match fixing offers an even greater threat			1
" it 's just as negative as racism but i would say match fixing is even more negative because it 's very , very bad and we must n't know who is going to win , " he said			1
" so , for me , the worst thing in football is a match that is fixed			2
" @entity9 , 66 , will be putting himself up for election for his seventh spell as @entity72 chief in @entity91 next month , having overseen an @entity92 in @entity93 which was claimed by @entity94 with a 1 - 0 win over @entity96 in sunday 's final .			1
