-- on june 11 , 1962 , three @entity2 inmates -- @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 -- attempted to leave the infamous @entity7 island prison in a bold escape attempt involving dummy heads , chipped - through walls and a raft made of raincoats			1
they were never seen again			0
for years , @entity2 aficionados -- not to mention the authorities -- have wondered whether the trio could have survived the attempt and made it to freedom			1
now a @entity21 study has shown that , if their timing was right , the inmates just might have done so			1
based on models of tidal currents in the bay -- and inspired by an episode of the @entity31 's " mythbusters " -- the team of researchers showed that if the @entity4 brothers and @entity5 left @entity2 at midnight and headed north , they could have reached land			1
" if they hit it exactly at midnight , the beautiful thing is that we see that they would have been sucked out towards the @entity41 , " @entity34 , one of the researchers , told the @entity36 , which first reported on the study			2
" but the moment they were close to the @entity44 would have been the moment the tide reverses			0
and that would give them a moment of slack tide , in which they could have reached marine headlands in the northern site of the @entity41 , " he said			0
the researchers put together a graphic for the best - case scenario : the window , however , was narrow , @entity34 observed			0
if the three left before midnight , the tides would have pushed them toward the ocean , where they would have died of hypothermia , @entity34 said			2
and if they left after 1 a.m. , the tides would have pushed them toward the @entity65 , and they also would have probably died of hypothermia in the cold waters			2
hut allows that they could have survived the latter departure , though they were likely to have been picked up by police since they would have made landfall after sunrise			1
that 's the worst - case scenario : only one person , @entity74 , is known to have survived an @entity2 escape attempt , and he was captured the next day			1
however , @entity74 's successful swim across the channel to @entity7 -- six months after the attempt by the @entity79 and @entity5 -- made it feasible that others could have done so as well			1
it 's unlikely , though possible , that the @entity4 brothers and @entity5 are alive today if they survived			1
@entity4 and @entity3 , who were bank robbers , would be 83 and 84 , respectively			0
@entity5 , who had an extensive record , would be 88			0
still , the case has remained open			0
at the time of a 2009 @entity90 report , the @entity87 was still investigating the case , and though the @entity92 ended its investigation in 1979 , a note on an archived @entity92 web page devoted to the case says that any leads can still be called in			0
@entity98 was closed on march 21 , 1963			0
it 's now a @entity100 and is open to visitors .			2

trio of @entity2 escapees may have survived their *journey* , study says
two brothers and *colleague* left in june 1962 and were never seen again
it 's likely they perished , but if their timing was right they could have made it , study says
one person is known to have escaped from @entity2 while it was a *federal* pen
