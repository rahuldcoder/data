-- when working on her nude series , artist @entity1 sometimes joins other photographers at group photo shoots with a model in a studio			1
she 's usually the only woman , and she 's usually the only one without a high - powered digital camera			1
she always gets funny looks when she joins a group shoot with just her phone			0
last week one photographer said to her , " oh , gee , that works for you ? " in fact , it works quite well for her			1
she shoots , composites and manipulates all her pieces on her @entity18			2
@entity20 's nude series explores whether a female photographer approaches photographing women differently than the male photographers who dominate the field			2
the series has not only been recognized as great @entity18 work , but it also stacks up well against traditional photography			2
her work won two awards in the international @entity32 photography competition and won first place in the @entity35 category in the @entity36 , an international photography competition			2
since she discovered the potential of the @entity18 as a photography and art tool a year and a half ago , @entity1 has downloaded 50 photography apps and stowed away her bulky cameras that had been invaluable tools in her art career for the past four decades			1
" i have n't really shot with my camera since , " she said			0
smartphone artwork is increasingly becoming recognized as a viable new media form , providing an opportunity for veterans to expand their style and reach			2
mixed media artist @entity50 has worked in welding , film and digital photography , printmaking , painting and @entity56 ; for him , the @entity18 is just another canvas			1
" it 's not out of disrespect for traditional processes , " @entity57 said			0
" it 's just another way of taking a creative idea and putting it out there for people to share			0
" his mixed media works might include a photo manipulated on the @entity18 , then printed on a canvas and overlaid with acrylic paint			1
@entity71 , a former photographer for @entity72 who is also now experimenting in mixed media , said he pulls photos taken on his @entity75 into his phone and applies filters			1
sometimes clients like them more than the full resolution photos			0
he finds beauty in imperfections : in scars on people and in scratches and overexposure effects of some @entity88 filters			0
for him , app experimentation is like sketching			0
art photography : when ' reality is n't good enough ' " there 's no stress , " he said			0
" i do n't have a client breathing over my neck			0
" it also allows him to document his personal life without feeling like he 's in work mode , unlike when he has a camera hanging around his neck			2
" there are some moments you do n't want to be carrying a camera so you can be involved in it , but a cell phone is a lot more spontaneous , " @entity103 said			0
all three artists said settling for the lower resolution of the photos was worth the improvisation the @entity18 allows			2
they can grab a shot of a neat cloud formation when running errands , or composite a new piece while waiting in a doctor 's office			0
it 's not only experienced artists playing on their phones			1
smartphones and apps provided a platform and tools for creative types who had n't pursued art because of lack of training or supply funding			0
@entity134 and her partner , @entity135 , launched the website iphoneart.com in 2010 for mobile artists to upload their portfolios and share techniques with each other			1
they hosted the @entity142 in august , which they said was the largest gathering of mobile art to date with more than 200 artists ' work showcased			1
" there were well - known artists alongside soccer moms , " @entity134 said			1
" people from all over the world , from @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , were able to come together in a way that was n't possible before in the world of art. " mobile devices have allowed more people to become part of the art world , and both @entity134 and @entity1 , whose work was featured in the festival and is posted on the site , are welcoming the newcomers			1
on wednesday @entity134 launched an iprint online store where artists sell prints of their work			1
" we feed each others ' creativity , " said @entity1 , who is teaching her techniques at workshops			1
" i can teach techniques , but people have to have a vision and work from a place where they can express themselves			2
" @entity134 said she often hears that mobile artists are n't truly artists because they hit a button to apply a few filters , and it 's the app developers who are doing the real work			1
" these artists are innovating art at the front of the field and doing things these app creators did n't even know was possible			0
they 're inventing new processes , " she said			0
" it 's a real collaboration			0
" do you think mobile phone art is a legitimate art form ? share your take in the comments section below .			0
