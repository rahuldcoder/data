-- picture this scene : you 're just digging into your restaurant meal , the wine is flowing and the ambiance is perfect -- and then , bam ! your dining companion swats away your hand , scolding you for touching the appetizer before she could take a photo			2
sound familiar ? the trend of photographing one 's food , brought about in large part by apps like @entity17 , can seem obnoxious on many levels			1
but @entity19 , director of photography at @entity20 , says it 's all about preserving memories			1
" meals are special times for people ... the picture of the food is a representation of that moment , " he said			1
" food is very fleeting in our lives			1
it 's on our plate and 20 minutes later it 's gone and we have an empty dish			1
" those meals become even more special when they are being enjoyed while traveling			1
looking back on a photo of a meal eaten overseas can conjure up the sights , sounds , scents and tastes of the trip			2
this spring , chef and author @entity44 will take his adventure - seeking appetite -- and @entity0 viewers -- along on a journey of cultures and cuisine from around the world on his new show , " @entity54			1
" @entity44 's tasty excursions may not be something we can all do for a living , but from the coastal piers of @entity61 to the mountainous terrains of @entity63 , you 've experienced amazing off - the - beaten - track meals , too			1
here are some of your favorite food photos and the stories behind them			1
getting the local fixings it was early january of this year when @entity70 and her fiance decided to escape the grind of their @entity74 , @entity75 , lives and head down to the @entity78			2
while traveling through @entity80 , they were greeted with sunshine , warm waters and the faint sound of salsa music playing in the background			1
the music caught @entity88 's attention , but it was the incredible aroma of food that drew her closer			1
" we watched three ladies prepare and cook fresh fish in a makeshift kitchen with a portable stove and mini-fridge , " she said			2
" it was not really a restaurant , but more like an outdoor public space by the pier with a few plastic tables and chairs , and many local people standing by , waiting for their turn to have a seat , " she said			1
intrigued , she decided to stand in line , where she learned the place offered one dish			2
" it was a whole fish that was previously marinated , then dipped in a batter and deep - fried to crispy perfection , " she said			2
" it was served with pickled , spicy onions , fried plantains and rice			2
" to her surprise , she says the fish , served on a simple @entity121 plate , was one of the best dishes she tried during her trip			1
" it was such a simple dish , served without fanfare , yet a real delight			0
" eating with the city a low - key dinner can sometimes be the most appetizing ; at least @entity130 thinks so			0
after days of hiking through the @entity131 , @entity130 and his travel partner , @entity133 , decided to take a much - needed rest at their riad in @entity137 , @entity138			1
a riad is akin to a @entity141 - style bed and breakfast			0
they could have gone to an upscale restaurant to celebrate their trip and @entity133 's birthday , but instead they decided to dine on the rooftop of their riad , which overlooks the city			1
they ordered the @entity137 chicken , which is widely served across the country			0
the dish consists of chicken slow - cooked as a stew in a tagine -- a traditional @entity138 cooking vessel -- and flavored with whole green olives , preserved lemons and @entity138 spices			0
it was served on a fluffy bed of couscous			0
" it was exceptionally tender and moist and flaked from the bone			0
the spices were quintessentially @entity138 , and the preserved lemon is something not commonly used here in the @entity173 , " he said			0
but it was n't just the dish that he says was the best part of the meal			0
it was the ambiance of their dinner as well			0
" the @entity183 had a beautiful rooftop dining area from which we could see most of the city , " he said			0
" the sun was setting and evening calls to prayer were coming from the minarets of the nearby mosques			0
it was @entity133 's birthday and the food , the atmosphere were perfect			1
" crossing state lines for a tasty getaway for @entity200 resident @entity199 , there are no mountains to cross to find a delicious dish			1
in fact , her favorite food is just across state lines			1
the drive to @entity207 , @entity61 , always brings feelings of nostalgia and hunger for her and her husband , @entity213 they slip away from home -- and work -- to escape the occasional stresses that build up from their jobs			0
a few times a year , they make their way to the @entity61 coast to visit their favorite restaurant , @entity223 's , which she says is known for its delicious lobster dishes			1
but besides the tender lobster meat steaming fresh out of the shell , she says the seafood joint is simply inviting			0
" the restaurant has a fish market in the front and you can watch the guys shuck fresh oysters or you can buy fish at the market if you 'd like , " she said			0
if the market is n't your ideal setting , you can walk onto the restaurant 's deck , overlooking @entity243			1
" we like to sit on the deck and watch the gates open to let the boats go through or watch people paddle - board by , " she said			1
but it 's the little gems that bring delight to their meals , like seeing swans , like @entity256 , swim up to the restaurant			1
" @entity256 the swan adopted the place as his home and the staff goes down to the dock to play with him , " she said			0
" he swims right up to the tables and at first you are n't sure , but then you realize that @entity256 is a regular			0
" finding a homemade meal in a new place whether it 's trekking through the mainland of @entity269 or swimming in the waters of @entity271 , traveling is a way of life for @entity274 , who works for the @entity275			1
so that means she is always trying new dishes			2
but the @entity279 said her favorite dish is nothing luxurious			0
instead , it 's a fresh fish salad called ' @entity283 ' ika			2
' @entity283 ' ika is a @entity286 dish made with raw fish that is marinated in lemon juice for several hours before it is smothered in a rich coconut milk and mixed with an array of veggies			0
@entity274 heard people raving about it while she worked as a teacher in @entity295 , @entity271			2
" at first i was skeptical since i 'd never eaten any raw fish other than in sushi , " she said			0
" but the seafood here is top rate and it 's so fresh you almost want to eat it right out of the water			2
" the tropical climate and fresh fish was enough of a reason for her to muster up her courage and give the @entity286 dish a try			0
" i was completely won over by the lovely taste and texture , " she said			0
she adored the dish so much she even learned how to make it			0
" but it will never be the same without the local fish and coconuts along with the @entity271 company and atmosphere , of course			0
