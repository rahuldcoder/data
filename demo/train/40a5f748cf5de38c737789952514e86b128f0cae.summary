@entity0 -- republicans reacted with surprise and recrimination sunday to blistering criticism of the @entity7 war from former coalition commander retired lt. gen. @entity9			1
lawmakers lashed back at retired gen. @entity9 on sunday after he criticized the war effort			1
on friday , @entity9 , who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004 , called the @entity7 war " a nightmare with no end in sight			1
" he said the @entity17 administration , the @entity18 and @entity19 all share blame			0
speaking with military reporters in @entity21 , @entity9 also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial , but the politicians have not been held accountable			1
" i 'm astounded , really , " @entity29 @entity28 sen. @entity28 on @entity1 's " @entity30 " with @entity31 on sunday			1
@entity28 , who recently returned from @entity32 , said he and @entity34 presidential candidate sen. @entity33 had visited @entity9 several times in 2003 and 2004			1
" every time we talked to gen. @entity9 , we got pushback -- we have enough troops ; guard and reserves are n't being strained , " @entity28 said			1
he added that @entity9 's own record in @entity7 is blemished : @entity46 " got out of control under his watch			1
the war in general got out of control under his watch			0
" but @entity28 said that " finally , " with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional @entity52 troops since january , " we are getting it right			1
" @entity9 told reporters that @entity52 political leaders have cost @entity52 lives on the battlefield with their " lust for power			2
" @entity9 said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty , but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired			1
" while the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power , our soldiers die , " he said			0
that brought a tart response from @entity33 , the ranking @entity34 on the @entity71			1
" i wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time , " @entity33 told @entity77 's " @entity76			2
" he said @entity9 should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but " unfortunately , that does n't happen very often			1
" one of the reasons few speak out , he said , is evidenced by what happened to former army chief of staff gen. @entity82 , @entity33 said			2
@entity82 was sidelined after telling @entity19 that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy @entity7			2
sen. @entity84 , a @entity28 from @entity85 , told @entity87 's " @entity86 " that @entity9 is simply wrong			1
" my definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror , " he said			0
" i think we 're making significant progress toward that end			0
" but , he added , " i think the central government in @entity7 has been an embarrassment			2
they 've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for			0
" @entity28 said he hopes the government of prime minister @entity107 will " step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year			2
" if that does not happen , he said , " it will be incumbent upon us , as a nation , to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable @entity7			2
" that brought a blistering response from @entity116 , national security adviser under president @entity117			0
" what is this ? this is a colony , " he said			0
" that 's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter			0
" even those @entity7 who were happy to see @entity127 toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing @entity52 presence , @entity116 said			0
though some countries are willing to go along with the @entity52 , " no one in the world really supports our policy in @entity7 , " he said			0
in his friday speech , @entity9 added that the " surge " of @entity52 troops into @entity7 represents " a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war			1
" @entity143 spokeswoman @entity142 did not address the comment			0
instead , she said , " we appreciate his service to the country			0
as @entity149 and ambassador @entity150 said , there 's more work to be done but progress is being made in @entity7			0
