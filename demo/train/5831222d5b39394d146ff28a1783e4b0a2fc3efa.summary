-- since i first became aware of the maddening case of 36 - year - old @entity3 , who seeks admission to the @entity5 , i 've tried to convince myself this accomplished young man -- a law school graduate who passed the bar exam -- should be able to practice law despite the inconvenient fact that he is an undocumented immigrant			1
yet , i ca n't			2
my heart goes out to @entity3			1
but my head wo n't go along			1
this week , the @entity14 @entity13 held a hearing to decide whether @entity3 is eligible for a law license in @entity14 in a case that is certain to impact the fate of other undocumented immigrants in pursuit of legal careers			1
@entity3 is opposed by the @entity24 administration 's @entity22 , which cites a 1996 law that prohibits states from providing undocumented immigrants with public benefits , including professional licenses			1
he is supported by @entity14 attorney general @entity30 , who argues the issuance of law licenses is n't a federal matter but up to states to decide			1
a decision from the court is expected in the next 90 days			0
@entity3 came to the @entity37 from @entity38 with his family when he was a toddler			2
he returned to @entity38 with his mother when he was 9 and came back to the @entity37 when he was 17			0
that was back in 1994 , and he is still waiting to hear from @entity43			0
he told @entity44 that he is n't worried about being deported because his case is well - known and he had notified immigration officials that he is in the @entity37 awaiting a decision on his citizenship			1
while he waits , he has been working hard toward his goal of becoming a lawyer			0
he paid for his studies at @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity14 , by working at a grocery store			0
yet , in the immigration debate , we must separate the individual from the idea			1
the individual -- @entity3 -- looks like a keeper			1
the idea -- that one who has lived most of his life outside the law can practice law -- is problematic			1
this young man wants to put his hand on a @entity68 and pledge the following : " i solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that i will support the @entity69 of the @entity37 and the @entity70 , and that i will faithfully discharge the duties of an attorney and counselor at law to the best of my knowledge and ability			2
" that oath comes from the @entity5 , which states : " it is the duty of an attorney to ... support the laws of the @entity37 and of this state ... maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers ... ( and ) never to seek to mislead the judge or any judicial officer by an artifice or false statement of fact or law			2
" how is @entity3 supposed to uphold " the laws of the @entity37 " when he is , by his mere presence in this country , in violation of federal law ? how does he pledge to show respect for " the courts of justice " when , for most of his life , he has lived here in defiance of the rule of law ? and how can he claim that he wo n't " mislead " a judge or judicial officer when living in the @entity37 illegally requires deception on a daily basis ? if @entity3 had more respect for the profession that he is seeking to join , he might have second thoughts about whether he is eligible to join it			1
yet , he seems to feel entitled to a law license and everything that comes with it			0
i 've had contact with @entity3 in the past , and i 'm worried that he 's lived in the @entity37 for so long that he 's picked up some bad habits from his fellow @entity37			1
several months ago , @entity3 posted on @entity115 : " i have a career lined up with the potential of offering employment to @entity37 citizens , no criminal record anywhere and have been in limbo for the last 19 years			2
where the hell is my @entity125 ? lol " i responded : " not to pick a fight , @entity127			0
but your question is very much part of the problem			0
' where 's mine ? where 's my @entity125 ? gim me , gim me			0
' you 're an @entity37 after all			0
i 'll tell the kid at @entity137 , the one with the sense of entitlement , to scoot over and make room			0
" i continued : " if @entity37 gives you the chance to live the dream , do n't you think it 's fair for her to ask for something in return ? she decided that she wanted your respect , and that this could be demonstrated by you respecting her laws -- the same laws you say you want to spend your life serving and defending in a courtroom			2
do n't you see the irony there ? " @entity3 responded : " let me get done with lunch so i can address your entitlement issues			1
" he never got back to me			0
in his public comments , i have n't seen evidence that @entity3 has considered for one minute the possibility that this case is about issues larger than himself , his plans , his dreams			1
i do n't think he has			0
and if the court decides in his favor , he never will			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			2

@entity170 : should an illegal immigrant be able to practice law ?
@entity170 : in the case of @entity3 , my heart says yes but my head wo n't go along
he asks how does @entity3 show respect for law when he has lived in defiance of rule of law ?
@entity170 : in the immigration debate , we must separate the individual from the idea
