-- @entity2 's speech accepting the @entity4 nomination for president in 1992 went through 22 drafts			1
but from the first to the last , he insisted on including a call to service			1
@entity9 was mired in a recession			0
the deficit was high , and confidence was low			0
but the young governor of @entity14 was determined to try to inspire a new generation of young people the way president @entity18 had inspired him			1
" just think of it , " he told the nation			0
millions of energetic young men and women serving their country by policing the streets or teaching the children or caring for the sick			1
or working with the elderly and people with disabilities			2
or helping young people to stay off drugs and out of gangs , giving us all a sense of new hope and limitless possibilities			1
" through persistent , bipartisan effort , that dream became law 20 years ago this week			1
nearly a million @entity9 have spent 1.2 billion hours serving their country , their community , their neighbors in @entity43			1
they helped mend hearts after september 11			2
they helped mend communities after @entity47			1
today , they help children from broken homes and veterans with no homes			1
they have taught countless kids , comforted countless seniors , touched countless lives			0
@entity56 was in the first class of @entity43 volunteers			1
an idealistic kid from @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity56 had just graduated from the @entity62			0
he joined @entity63 ) and was soon building houses for -- and with -- the poor in @entity66			1
" it really was one of the greatest experiences i 've ever had , " he said			0
" i just met the most wonderful people			2
and all kinds of people : hippies , yuppies , cowboys , church people , corporate executives , plumbers , electricians , rich , poor , you name it			1
everyone was out there because they wanted to do something -- swing a hammer , hang some @entity86 , paint a fence -- to chip away at the problem of poverty housing			0
" @entity56 went on to become a successful international political consultant , advising politicians across the country and around the world , but he says those days sweating in the @entity61 sun was the best job he ever had			0
@entity96 did not come to @entity43 wanting to save the world			1
he was sent there by a criminal justice system that was trying to save him			0
" at 17 years old , i was at a crossroads , " he said of his youth in @entity102 and @entity103			2
" i had a choice			0
either i was going to continue the lifestyle that had forced me into community service or choose an americorps program called @entity109			2
my year in @entity43 with @entity109 not only helped put my education back on track , put money in my pocket and ultimately helped me shape the foundation of social justice i stand on , but it completely transformed my view of service			1
" @entity96 helps young people affected by the incarceration of family members			1
he has rebuilt homes and schools and lives			0
when asked his occupation , he proudly says , " community builder			0
" he has earned his undergraduate degree , is looking to get a masters and is organizing lead , leadership through @entity131 , which seeks to breathe new life into @entity133 , @entity103 ' oldest -- but far from wealthiest -- neighborhood			0
there are 900,000 @entity135 and @entity136			0
they have created ripples of hope that will continue to radiate out into the lives of millions of people			0
surely , that is something to celebrate			0
when president @entity145 stands on the @entity146 of the @entity147 on friday to swear in new volunteers , he will almost certainly look back on two decades of getting things done			1
but he will also , i hope , focus on all there is yet to do			0
there is a growing movement to take national service to the next level , to make a year of service a rite of passage for every @entity9 who wants to serve			2
retired gen. @entity159 , who was @entity9 's top commander on the battlefields of @entity161 , has a new mission : " all young @entity9 should have the opportunity and feel the responsibility to serve their country , " he wrote this summer in @entity166			2
" we need to create a culture in which at least a year of service is culturally expected , if not quite mandatory by law			0
" just as the members of the @entity171 were bound together by their common service in the second @entity173 and just as @entity175 vets have a kinship that crosses partisan lines , so too should today 's young people			1
so on this 20th anniversary of @entity43 , let 's pause a moment to thank the @entity182 for giving us all a sense of new hope and limitless possibilities .			2

@entity188 : @entity2 was determined to include a call to service during his *administration*
