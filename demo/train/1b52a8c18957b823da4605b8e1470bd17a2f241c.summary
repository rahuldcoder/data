-- on a hot summer day in early august , 2008 , the secure @entity3 phone in my office at @entity6 was lighting up with calls from national security adviser @entity8			1
the @entity9 had invaded the @entity10 in the @entity12 mountain region			2
@entity10 president @entity13 was frantic about his country 's safety and desperate for information on @entity18 forces and @entity18 's intent			2
i promised @entity8 some answers , hung up the phone and walked to my outer office to direct my executive assistants to " get our @entity10 people up here right away			2
" as they busily dialed phones and typed e-mails , i remember turning to my chief of staff and only half jokingly asking him , " we 've got @entity10 people , right ? " i recall that day now as a debate has begun about the focus of the @entity35 intelligence community and especially of the @entity6			1
in discussing his new book , " the way of the knife , " @entity37 national security correspondent @entity36 suggests that @entity6 's obsession with fighting terrorism might have blinded it to the inevitability , imminence and rapid spread of the @entity44			1
in march , press reports said the president 's @entity48 , a panel of senior outside advisers , had come to much the same conclusion , accusing the intelligence community of too much focus on military operations and drone strikes at the expense of other targets such as @entity57 and the @entity58			2
back in august 2008 , we did indeed have " @entity10 people , " and they were quite good			2
within a few days , the entire team was gathered around a conference table at @entity6 headquarters giving president @entity64 their personal appreciation of the situation			1
but precise tactical intelligence was hard to come by ( questions such as where exactly was the front line of @entity18 troops )			2
recent technical collection systems had been developed and deployed for the counterterrorism target , not for tracking the successor to the @entity75			2
and the fact that i had asked my half - joking question should suggest that neither the topic of @entity10 nor the " @entity10 people " were frequent visitors to my office			0
more broadly , when asked what were the priorities of the agency during my time there , i would respond with a bit of @entity87 - insider alphabet soup , " @entity90 , @entity89 , row			1
" translation : counterterrorism , counterproliferation ( mostly @entity94 ) , the rest of the world			1
the @entity35 intelligence community works hard against a variety of tough targets every day , but questions about current balance and emphasis are as understandable as they are inevitable			1
the demands of more than a decade of constant war have clearly had their impact			0
much of what passes for analysis today is really targeting : targeting an individual for direct action , targeting an individual for increased collection , targeting an individual to make sure he does n't board an aircraft en route to the @entity35			1
the @entity115 has always had two sides to its personality : a national enterprise that meets the needs of policymakers across the @entity35 government and one that serves as a combat support agency for the @entity123 of which it remains a part			1
even with a substantially increased budget , after more than a decade of combat , it should be clear that the battlefield support side of the agency 's personality has become increasingly dominant			2
since 2001 , @entity6 case officers have routinely been sent to war zones as their first operational assignment			1
but the skills they have honed there are often different from the skills required for classical espionage and many are frankly bored when they return to more routine work where @entity141 and a personal weapon are not required equipment			0
@entity35 's singular focus on counterterrorism has also affected intelligence cooperation with allies			1
many simply do not agree with our legal position that this is a war and others object to tactics such as targeted killings and extraordinary renditions			0
although most appreciate that @entity35 actions have made them safer , the potential uses to which we could put their information strains intimacy and limits sharing			1
we occasionally have to pull our own punches			0
to what degree , for example , did we limit contacts ( intelligence or otherwise ) with the @entity164 in @entity166 's @entity165 so as not to risk the solid counterterrorism partnership with the regime ? some are now calling these actions a distortion of @entity35 intelligence , but none of these steps was inappropriate for the circumstances in which we found ourselves after 9/11			1
indeed , i initiated some of them and supported all of them while in government			0
many of them need to continue			0
@entity184 's threat is diminished , not eliminated			0
@entity185 , former @entity186 official and head of the @entity188 , may have put it best when he suggested that what we need here is a dial , not a switch			0
and this is more than just an intelligence question			0
collection and analysis usually chase after the things that policymakers hold most dear			2
if their view is immediate and tactical , much of their intelligence will follow			0
my " @entity10 people " were great			0
i should have paid more attention to them before august 2008			0
priorities being what they were , i did n't			0
i was reflecting on this when , a few weeks before his confirmation hearing , i had breakfast with @entity215			0
as we were leaving the table , i suggested that the @entity6 had never looked more like its wartime predecessor , @entity219 , than it did right then			1
that had made @entity35 safer , but i reminded the eneral that the @entity6 was not the @entity219			1
it was the nation 's leading espionage and analytic service and that -- much as i did -- he would have to struggle to remember that every day			0
all this means that tough choices lie ahead , all of them fraught with risk , as the community deals with current dangers while also embracing broader and more enduring tasks			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			1

*ex-cia* chief says some are urging @entity6 to get out of targeting terrorists
he says the agency had to broaden its role after @entity35 was attacked on 9/11
@entity236 says @entity6 also has a *key* role in analyzing world threats
he says agency needs to fulfill roles of targeting and analysis
