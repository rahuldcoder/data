the runway was quite literally brought to the bargaining table			0
models strutted their gowns across the same surface on which resolutions are passed , and where environmentalists gather to sort out climate issues			0
this cultural event , however , was not immune to the conflict and fighting that so many other @entity4 meetings are centered around			2
as violence between @entity13 and @entity29 goes on for weeks -- with serious tension in the holy city of @entity32 -- @entity33 , @entity29 ambassador to the @entity4 , blasted the @entity13 delegation hours before the show for not condemning the acts of violence back in the @entity37			1

" this is a racist remark , as if we , the @entity13 , can not be a part of humanity to share the rest of humanity and the rest of the international community our creativity in the field of fashion , " @entity11 said			2
the unveiling of @entity14 's latest fall - winter collection was inspired by @entity70 , his home country , the designer said			1
the fabrics themselves donned elements of peace and conflict : garments featured wood from olive branches brought from @entity70 to @entity14 's studio in @entity15 as well as embroideries -- a classic @entity13 design heritage -- made by @entity13 refugees			1
despite the current tension in the @entity37 , which has spanned multiple weeks , both @entity11 and @entity14 said they believe that fashion and design can play a role in promoting peace			2
" music has a role , fashion has a role , cinema has a role , intellectuals have a role , parliamentarians , politicians , diplomats -- all of it , " @entity11 said			0
