@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the technology world , a form of breaking bread can involve sharing hardware schematics			0
@entity7 invited reporters , hardware makers and rival internet companies to its headquarters to debut a new initiative on thursday for improving website infrastructure			1
with this @entity14 , @entity7 is publishing documents that describe how to build the network of computers that support the site 's millions of users and enormous banks of information			1
" it 's easy to look past what powers that , " @entity7 ceo @entity24 said in his introduction			1
" a lot of the stuff that the mass manufacturers ( of servers ) were putting out was n't exactly what we needed and what a lot of the social apps need			0
" representatives from @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and several other competitors were seen at the event			0
some attending the meeting said they were there to learn and are mulling what contributions they could make or knowledge they could gain from the documents			0
@entity49 announced a new pricing structure for its cloud hosting services on thursday morning , which reduces the cost for some of its server - hosting programs			1
many startups as well as big companies like @entity38 and @entity58 have relied on @entity49 's web services at one time or another			1
@entity7 's initiative could be seen as a potential jab at @entity36 and @entity49 , which closely guard information about their infrastructure and facilities , @entity62 analyst @entity61 wrote in a report			1
@entity58 , which makes @entity69 , provided an executive for a panel held after the announcement but did n't commit to the project			0
the company , with its 250 million players , is " really intrigued " about piloting the system on an internal network , @entity74 , an executive for infrastructure engineering at @entity58 , said on the panel			0
however , " we have n't run it through its paces at this time , " he said			0
@entity7 says its new servers are about 31 % more energy efficient than previous ones the company used , which were in line with the industry average			1
they keep cool using outside air funneled through a data center instead of pricey air - conditioning units			0
@entity7 's main data center resides in @entity94 , @entity95			1
a fairly large server farm can ring up an annual energy bill of $ 10 million , said @entity98 , chairman of a large web hosting company called @entity100			1
@entity7 's design could reduce that yearly power cost to $ 6 million , @entity98 estimated			2
" we could continue doing things the normal way			0
or we could take a little detour , and do things extra special , " @entity106 , a @entity7 vice president for technical operations , said onstage			2
" it 's really good for the environment , and it 's a really smart use of our resources as a small and growing company			0
" servers are n't sexy , but @entity7 certainly tried to make the underpinnings more broadly appealing			2
" it 's functionally beautiful , " said @entity116 , @entity7 's hardware design manager , describing a server free of paint or screws like a car salesman might			2
" it would be sweet if we could light the data center up in blue -- so that 's what i ended up doing			0
" @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 had demonstration tables for its server technology in the back of the event , held in @entity7 's cafeteria			2
@entity129 is already using @entity7 's motherboards in its hardware , and @entity7 has already secured 10 to 15 partners for the initiative , said @entity141 , @entity7 's director of hardware design and supply chain .			1

@entity7 is reaching out to rivals with a new initiative around web infrastructure
the social networking giant released documents to show how it builds data centers
