-- top aides to president @entity2 on sunday signaled that some @entity4 troops could start coming home from @entity6 as soon as july 2011 , but most would likely remain there for several years			1
in appearances on all the major talk shows , @entity9 officials and military advisers clarified the president 's position after he walked a political tightrope by announcing he will send 30,000 more troops to @entity6 and that some will start coming home in 19 months			1
national security adviser gen. @entity18 told @entity0 's " @entity22 " that the july 2011 start of withdrawal was " not a cliff , it 's a ramp " for beginning to turn over security responsibility to @entity6 forces			1
noting the @entity4 strategic interests in the region , including nuclear power @entity28 next door , @entity18 said : " we 're going to be in the region for a long time			0
" gen. @entity33 , the head of @entity34 , said on " @entity35 " that @entity2 's strategy " does n't trigger a rush to the exits , " while defense secretary @entity39 told @entity41 ' " @entity40 " that " there is n't a deadline			1
" " what we have is a specific date on which we will begin transferring responsibility for security district by district , province by province in @entity6 to the @entity6 , " @entity39 said			1
the challenge has been to meet the need cited by military leaders for more troops and resources to wipe out terrorist networks in @entity6 and to help the @entity6 government overcome the @entity59 insurgency , while satisfying the @entity61 's liberal base , which opposes the deployment of more troops			1
@entity39 explained the rationale for sending more forces on @entity67 's " @entity66 , " saying the @entity6 - @entity28 border is " the epicenter of extremist jihad			2
" " and @entity71 has close relationships with the @entity59 in @entity6 , and they have very close relationships with the @entity59 in @entity28 , " @entity39 continued			2
" the @entity59 in @entity28 have been attacking @entity28 civilians , @entity28 government officials , military officials , trying to destabilize the government of @entity28			0
" any success by the @entity59 in either @entity6 or @entity28 benefits @entity71 , @entity39 said , adding that " any safe haven on either side of the border creates opportunities for them to recruit , get new funds and do operational planning			2
" " and what 's more , the @entity59 revival in the safe havens in western @entity28 is a lesson to @entity71 that they can come back , if they are provided the kind of safe haven that the @entity59 were , " @entity39 said			0
in addition , @entity39 warned on @entity91 's " @entity90 " that @entity4 casualties " will probably continue to grow " as troops take on @entity59 strongholds			2
however , @entity39 rejected a comparison to the @entity97 's decision in 1985 to send more troops to bolster its occupation of @entity6 , which ended in failure less than two years later			1
" the parallel just does n't work , " @entity39 said			0
" the reality is the @entity97 invaded @entity6			2
they killed a million @entity6			0
they made 5 million refugees out of @entity105			0
" in addition , he said , the @entity97 acted unilaterally , while the @entity4 - led mission in @entity6 involves 42 countries with a mandate from @entity111			0
in @entity113 , @entity112 generally backed @entity2 's deployment plan but complained that announcing the start of a withdrawal was a signal to the enemy of a compromised commitment			1
sen. @entity120 of @entity121 , the unsuccessful @entity112 presidential candidate last year , told @entity91 's " @entity90 " that a strategy must be flexible to succeed , rather than limited by a set timetable			0
on " @entity35 , " sen. @entity124 , the chamber 's second - ranking @entity125 , called the july 2011 start of a withdrawal a necessary signal to @entity6 president @entity130			1
according to @entity124 , @entity2 's message to @entity130 was : " we 're not going to make @entity6 a protectorate of the @entity4			1
you have to change your government			0
you have to show that you are willing to stand up and fight for your own country			0
" " i think that message is long overdue , " @entity124 said .			0
