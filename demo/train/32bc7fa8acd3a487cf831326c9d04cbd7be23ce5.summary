@entity2 president @entity0 -- who once famously declared " there is not a black @entity4 and a white @entity4 " -- is again feeling his way through a volatile debate over race that offers fresh evidence of the nation 's enduring divisions			1
the first @entity12 - @entity12 president is confronting the delicate issues of justice and discrimination after renewed violence this week in @entity17 , @entity18 , sparked by a grand jury 's decision not to indict a white police officer who shot and killed @entity22 , a black youth , this summer			1
these issues refuse to fade for @entity0 , despite hopes that his election would lead to a post-racial era			2
on tuesday night in his hometown of @entity28 , @entity0 tried to master a balancing act that has become all too familiar during his nearly six years in the @entity30 , reflecting on the @entity12 - @entity12 experience while standing by the legal system			1
he offered comfort to those angered by the grand jury 's decision while identifying with the horror of looting and burning businesses in suburban @entity39			0
complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity17 " if any part of the @entity12 community does n't feel welcomed or treated fairly , that 's something that puts all of us at risk , " @entity0 said			1
but he added that " nothing of benefit results from destructive acts			0
for those who think that what happened in @entity17 is an excuse for violence , i do not have any sympathy for that			1
" it was not quite the rhetoric of the transcendent political figure who spoke eloquently about race during his first campaign , nor was it the impassioned president who reacted so personally in the aftermath of @entity67 teenager @entity66 's @entity65 's death			1
instead , @entity0 pledged to lead a national conversation on race and address the deep rooted belief in many communities of color " that our laws are not always being enforced uniformly			1
" @entity0 : ' no sympathy ' for violence in @entity17 @entity0 's remarks reflect his reluctance to take sides or cast judgment on the grand jury 's decision and an attempt to avoid adding to the racial turmoil			1
but they also show his struggle to talk about race in a way that connects with all @entity4			0
the president " is always on a teeter - totter of not really wanting to lean too far this direction , that direction , " said @entity88 , a longtime civil rights activist and chairman emeritus of the @entity90			0
" he does n't want to be the black president			1
he wants to be the president , and that constrains him a great deal			0
i do n't think he 'll ever overcome that			0
" his approach to @entity17 stands in contrast to remarks last year after @entity104 was acquitted in the 2012 shooting death of the 17 - year - old @entity65			2
at the time , @entity0 recounted his own experiences as a black man in deeply personal terms			1
" when @entity65 was first shot , i said that this could have been my son , " @entity0 said			2
" another way of saying that is @entity65 could have been me 35 years ago			0
" he continued : " there are very few @entity12 - @entity12 men who have n't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars			0
that happens to me -- at least before i was a senator			0
" he was more circumspect on monday as the violence in @entity17 first heated up , saying the nation has made " enormous progress in race relations			1
" " i 've witnessed that in my own life , and to deny that progress i think is to deny @entity4 's capacity for change , " he said			0
@entity0 has dealt gingerly with racial issues since he burst onto the national political scene in 2004 as a state senator from @entity131 who delivered a galvanizing speech at that year 's @entity133			2
his 2008 caucus win in the lily - white state of @entity136 launched his path to the presidency			0
he would later speak with pride about his " commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country			0
" @entity144 : protests across the @entity4 but he had to confront the issue more directly later in 2008 amid a furious debate over the incendiary remarks of his then - pastor @entity150			0
he responded with a speech in @entity153 in which @entity0 said @entity150 's views denigrated the " greatness and goodness of our nation " and rightly offended " white and black alike			1
" race would remain an unwelcome undercurrent throughout the campaign and after -- most notably when his aides had to confront claims by conservative conspiracy theorists that the president was not born in the @entity4 that controversy only faded when he produced a document certifying his birth for reporters			2
( conservatives and @entity171 activists refuted the idea that their vehement criticisms of the president had any racial grounding )			0
for five years after @entity0 's seminal speech on race in @entity153 , he tried to avoid racial issues but stumbled over the controversial case of @entity181 professor @entity180 who was arrested in his own home in 2009			1
@entity0 tackles immigration , @entity17 at hometown rally @entity0 allowed attorney general @entity185 and other officials to push forward on issues like voting rights and housing that are important to the @entity12 community			1
but the @entity65 case seemed to set a new tone for the second term of his presidency , where he has spoken with more ease about race			0
@entity0 was deeply affected by a private meeting he held last year with a group of young black boys about a mile from his home in @entity201 , @entity28			1
he recalled that encounter earlier this year as he unveiled his " @entity204 " mentoring project at the @entity30			0
" i could see myself in these young men , " @entity0 said , admitting that he was lucky he made his youthful transgressions in forgiving , multi-cultural @entity206 and not in @entity4 's deprived inner cities			2
at other times , @entity0 has used the civil rights movement to make a point about the capacity of political movements â€” even as his own change crusade shuddered to a halt			2
" the arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice , but it does n't bend on its own , " he said , quoting @entity216 , a half century after the @entity217 last year			0
but @entity0 has studiously avoided the debate over whether race is a factor in his sinking approval ratings			1
he also shies away from talking about whether race played a role in his party 's struggles in the @entity228 this election season , as @entity231 sen. @entity230 , a @entity232 , suggested during an interview about her own prospects for re-election this fall			0
people who have seen him in private settings say the president speaks more frankly about race than he has in public			2
the president , insiders say , feels a responsibility to use his remaining time in office to secure his legacy on @entity12 issues and has thought deeply about his own unique place in history			0
@entity249 , co-author of " @entity250 , " a study of racial politics in the @entity0 era , said the president understood the symbolism			1
" i definitely think he is conscious that as the first black president , he will be a subject of endless historical scrutiny as well as intense contemporary scrutiny , " @entity249 said			1
still , race is likely to remain an issue during @entity0 's final years in the @entity30			1
" for the overwhelming majority of people who just feel frustrated and pained because they get a sense that some communities are n't treated fairly or some individuals are n't seen as worthy as others -- i understand that and i want to work with you and i want to move forward with you , " @entity0 said tuesday			2
" your president will be right there with you			0
