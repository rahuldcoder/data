-- the secret to traveling in @entity2 is to sit back and let your expectations be defied			1
expect the unexpected in a country that offers glorious contradictions for the traveler to experience			0
the @entity2 state , for example , is less than a century old , but its history is ancient			1
the country contains the sandstone city of @entity14 , built and abandoned by the @entity15 and lost for a millennium after that , alongside @entity19 ruins , crusader castles , and mountains where prophets lived and listened			0
the @entity2 summer is long , hot , and dry , but it is still possible to swim and climb through the country 's river canyons throughout			1
the winters are freezing , but thermal waterfalls offer relief			2
the @entity30 at @entity31 offers exceptional marine life , but no fish or plants can withstand the intense salinity of the @entity36 , which allows the visitor to read a book whilst floating , even if the water itself is hundreds of meters below sea level			0
if the @entity47 of the north gave @entity2 its life , then the deserts of the south , home of the southern @entity46 nomads , gave @entity2 its soul			1
i tried to learn a little about the @entity2 by traveling across the southern desert , from @entity53 to @entity31 by camel			1
i learned a lot about myself along the way			0
ships of the desert camels may have an image problem , but they 're not unreliable			2
true , they love to eat , and will eat almost anything , including bananas			0
driving a camel is less an exercise of steering than of prompting the animal from one shrub to another			2
but any creature which , at the age of four , possesses the strength and endurance to cross one of the harshest places on @entity76 with a man and his supplies on its back , whilst drinking only twice in five days and eating nothing but thorns , does not deserve the label of unreliable			0
more : couch surfing a cave in southern @entity2 the sensation of riding a camel is at once irregular and predictable , much like sailing in a small boat			1
maybe that 's one of the reasons why they 've long been called ships of the desert			2
the view from the animal is astonishing , totally panoramic and unobstructed			0
and what a view it is that @entity53 offers			1
" vast , echoing , and @entity98 - like " these words were used by @entity100 to describe @entity53 , as he traveled the same route as us almost a century ago			1
by road , and by car , the 40 - mile journey from @entity53 to @entity31 can be done in less than an hour			1
by camel , and through the extended isolation of the desert , a comfortable journey will take five days and four nights			1
that pace will allow you to see the sites of @entity53 , and explore this imposing place			1
the red sands stretch like seas between mountains of crimson sandstone			0
the rock monoliths have been sculpted by nature to resemble the drippings of candle wax on a monumental scale			0
perspective becomes confused in @entity53			1
the elements contort , and move in eerie ways			0
the wind comes from nowhere , blows strongly for a few seconds , and then disappears for hours			0
bright blue birds leaped and darted around our camels before , just as suddenly , they disappeared			0
there is endless space in the desert , but time is something that you bring with you , like mineral water or tinned sardines			2
it is as though @entity142 has always been that way , and always will be			0
there is the movement of the sun , and the interplay of light and shadow , and that defines your waking hours			0
at night the campfire flickers and the moon drifts , and you are dazzled by the glitter of innumerable stars			2
the rocks retain the sun 's warmth for hours after it sets , and will lend it to you as you sleep against them			0
there is silence and there is peace			0
if you go @entity53 is four and a half hours drive from @entity165 , the @entity2 capital , by rental car			1
the national coach company , @entity167 , does not travel directly to @entity53 , but there are services to @entity14 ( where buses cover the one hour connection to @entity142 ) and to @entity31 ( which is 40 minutes by taxi from @entity53 )			1
more : the cave dwellers of @entity14 the @entity174 is not a single valley ( as the @entity177 word suggests ) but rather a vast area of protected desert in which the @entity46 have established numerous government - approved camps			1
always book a camp by email or phone , and try contacting several , before arriving at @entity53			1
this allows you to secure the best price , and know what to expect			0
more : ' inside the @entity191 ' heads to @entity2 most camps offer a similar service of tent or under - the - stars accommodation , meals cooked in the @entity46 style , and various desert activities			1
a night in the desert and a day of activities can cost you anything from around $ 30 per person upwards , depending on the degree of comfort you seek and whether you prefer a private or large group journey			2
prices can always be haggled , and are listed on the websites of tour companies along with the activities that they offer ( see below )			2
@entity53 is an outdoor experience , so do n't expect any hotels			2
a five - day camel trip is a more complex and unusual endeavor , so prices will always be negotiated and you should try several companies			1
i received quotes that varied from $ 80 to around $ 110 per person per day for a trip of two people			2
this includes everything from guides , camels , food , water , and bedding , which is brought to you each day by a jeep			2
i traveled with @entity231 ( sabbahrum@yahoo.com ) who offered fantastic quality and service			0
he is affiliated with @entity2 tracks			2
other larger agencies are @entity236 and @entity237			0
when to go like the rest of @entity2 , temperatures in @entity53 are very cold in the winter months and very hot in the summer , making the best time to visit during the @entity240 ( late march to early june ) and @entity241 ( late september to early november )			1
what to take even during @entity240 and @entity241 there is a difference between day and night time temperatures that makes it wise to pack for heat , but prepare for cold			0
bring some light thermals and a sturdy jacket , as these are great for sitting around a campfire then sleeping under the stars			0
comfortable clothing is fine for riding a camel , and if you do n't buy the red and white @entity2 head scarf , or keffiyeh , then your hosts may be able to provide one , as they serve well against all conditions and are the @entity46 item of choice			1
walking boots are a must for @entity53 if you intend to hike or climb , and for camel riding it is advisable to wear socks to the knee , and tight underwear under a loose underwear layer to prevent any rubbing of your skin			1
sun cream must be worn , even under thin clothes			0
sensitive electronics may deal badly with the sand and climate of @entity142 , so be careful			0
if you want to bring a book then bring a torch too , because there 's no electricity in the middle of the desert , but you may prefer to watch the stars and take a well - earned sleep instead .			1
