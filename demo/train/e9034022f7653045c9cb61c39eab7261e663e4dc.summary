@entity0 -- a single word , " @entity3 , " shows the delicacy of trying to forge a peace deal between @entity6 and the @entity7			2
two weeks ago , president @entity8 welcomed @entity6 prime minister @entity9 for @entity11 talks by calling for two states -- " a jewish state of @entity6 and a state of @entity18 " -- that would coexist " @entity13 in peace and security			1
" on monday , @entity8 outlined a similar vision when he met with @entity7 leader @entity20 , except for that one word , when he spoke of " a state that allows for the dignity and sovereignty of the @entity7 people and a state that allows for @entity6 to feel secure and at peace with their neighbors			1
" while the president clearly played to his respective audiences , the different language touched one of the stumbling blocks in getting @entity20 and @entity9 to agree to direct " final status " negotiations on an agreement to end the decades - long conflict between their people			1
at both meetings , @entity8 urged the visiting leaders to move past sticking points in the negotiating process , saying monday that " i believe that now is the time for not just the leaders of both sides but also the people of both sides to embrace this opportunity for peace			1
" @entity20 , the @entity51 president , noted the volatility of the entire @entity54 region meant that " we do n't have any time to waste " and that " time is not on our side " in reaching an agreement			2
a full - fledged deal seems about as far away now as it did eight months ago when secretary of state @entity60 kick - started the peace process			1
so far , the process has included a series of meetings along with incremental steps intended to build trust , such as prisoner releases			0
however , @entity60 's initial goal of an agreement by the end of the april has morphed into a possible framework for further talks through the end of 2014			1
even that modest outcome remains uncertain , given the reluctance of both sides to move from deeply entrenched demands on the logistics of coexistence			0
with @entity6 's next release of @entity7 prisoners scheduled for later this month , the possibility of a breakdown looms			0
both sides praise @entity60 's seemingly endless energy for the issue , which has included multiple visits to the region to prod the two sides to reach a middle ground			0
the secretary of state attended monday 's meeting			0
" @entity60 's relentlessness and skill in engaging the parties have created a process that will at least survive the @entity98 - imposed april deadline for a peace deal and live at least until year 's end , " @entity100 of the @entity101 wrote in an opinion piece for @entity1			1
while both sides have signaled agreement for the concept of a two - state solution in which @entity6 and an independent @entity7 nation would live side - by - side , they remain at odds over how to make that happen			2
particular areas of disagreement include borders , security issues , the status of @entity118 , and the rights of @entity7 who left of fled their homes in what is now @entity6			0
in another potential sticking point , @entity6 insists on recognition by the @entity7 of its right to exist as a jewish state			0
the issue made @entity8 's differing language all the more relevant .			0
