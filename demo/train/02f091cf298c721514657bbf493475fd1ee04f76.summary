-- inspectors found mildew on a ceiling and other problems last year at a peanut butter producing plant in @entity7 that has been linked to a salmonella outbreak , according to reports released monday by the state @entity10			1
a salmonella outbreak linked to a peanut butter plant has sickened nearly 500 people , the @entity12 says			1
but the owner of the @entity18 , @entity7 , plant -- @entity20 - based @entity19 -- described the problems as " relatively minor and for the most part corrected on site			2
" @entity19 this month stopped production at the @entity18 plant and launched a nationwide recall of peanut butter and peanut paste made there after july 1 , 2008			1
the @entity29 reported monday that @entity7 agriculture inspection reports from 2006 and 2007 depicted a series of sanitation lapses in the @entity18 plant			1
citing an inspection report from august 23 , 2007 , the @entity29 noted at least three incidences in which " food - contact surfaces " were " not properly cleaned and sanitized			0
" in an apparent response to the @entity29 article , @entity19 released a statement saying , " when the observations were noted during inspections by the @entity7 @entity10 , corrective action was taken immediately where possible and subsequently when immediate action was not possible			2
" the statement , which @entity19 sent to @entity0 accompanied by a copy of a state inspection report from last october , said " the most recent inspection observations by the state [ the october inspection report ] were relatively minor and for the most part corrected on site			0
" in the october 23 , 2008 report , an inspector said she found " mildew and possibly some static dust on ceiling of butter storage room			0
" the report did not specify the amount of mildew			0
the report continued with the notation , " @entity61 : 11/05/2008 , " but the report did not indicate whether any action was taken or whether a follow - up inspection occurred			0
moisture was blamed for an unrelated salmonella outbreak two years ago			2
that outbreak was traced to a different @entity7 peanut processing plant			2
a june 2008 inspection of @entity19 's @entity18 plant found violations including dust buildup on a fan in the butter room , and " possible metal flakes from metal scrubber which is used to clean outside of equipment , " according to an inspection report			0
the report did not indicate where the flakes were found			0
@entity19 has said that the peanut butter and peanut paste made at the @entity18 plant were sold in bulk to manufacturers , and that the recall does not involve any peanut butter jars sold directly to consumers			1
however , more than 125 products that include peanut butter or peanut paste , including @entity94 's celery with peanut butter packs and nutrition bars from @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 , have been recalled in connection with the @entity19 's recall			1
see a list of recalled products the @entity12 has counted nearly 500 cases of salmonella illnesses in 43 states from the most recent outbreak , and says the bacterial infection might have contributed to seven deaths			1
the @entity110 has a list of peanut products that are not affected by the recall .			0
