@entity1 the stunning photo shows a shimmering blue shoreline with the bright lights of @entity1 in the distance			1
the fluorescent blue glow is natural lighting powered by an algae bloom of @entity9 , commonly known as " @entity9			1
" the non-toxic phytoplankton is not considered harmful and is relatively common in @entity1			1
what is uncommon is capturing its iridescent glow on camera , which only appears when the water is disturbed			0
local photographer @entity16 also took an image of the phenomena at @entity19 in @entity1 's @entity20			1
" you can see the blue light if there is a wave , a boat moving , or a stone thrown in the water , " said @entity16 , who used a 30 - second exposure to get the shot			2
" there was no blue light when the water was calm , therefore many people threw stones into the water in order to see it			2
" despite its blue hue , the phenomena is referred to as a red tide and , according to a @entity1 government website that keeps track of sightings , several have been reported so far this year			1
@entity40 from the city 's @entity42 said the bloom was caused by high pollution in @entity45 , which was exacerbated by the slow flow of currents			2
she said nutrient levels are typically high in the region , due to restaurant waste and sewage running direct from village houses into the sea			0
@entity54 added that the algae can be deadly because it deprives the water of oxygen , though the government has not recorded any evidence of fish kills			0
" @entity1 and the entire @entity64 has a big problem with wastewater , and that is surely a factor with these plankton blooms , " said @entity61 from the @entity62 at the @entity63			1
he said , by itself , @entity9 does n't represent a threat to human or environmental health , but the huge bloom does represent an ecosystem that 's " out of balance			1
" " i guess the analogy is they 're like locusts that feed on agricultural crops			0
and once they find a good abundant food source they will multiply until the food source is exhausted			0
in @entity1 unfortunately most of the nutrients are coming from our own sewage			1
" the damage done to the environment does n't just happen when oxygen is depleted during the algae 's short lifetime			0
when the blooms die , they sink to the bottom of the sea when they decompose , consuming huge amounts of oxygen			0
" that 's when we have the formation of these dead zones , where anything that 's living , any fish or crab species living on the bottom , is at risk of dying from the low oxygen associated with that decomposition , " @entity61 said			0
@entity1 has a number of zones that suffer from persistently low levels of oxygen , which " increase in their severity and their scope whenever we have these algal blooms , " he added .			2

commonly known as " @entity9 , " the algae is not in itself considered harmful
however , algae bloom is a sign of a troubled ecosystem , *marine* *experts* say
