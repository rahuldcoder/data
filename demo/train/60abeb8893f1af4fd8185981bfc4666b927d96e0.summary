the weddings have happened -- but will they count ? a day after a federal judge struck down a @entity3 state amendment restricting marriage to between one man and one woman , gay and lesbian couples lined up saturday to make their unions official			1
" we never thought that we 'd see this day , " said @entity10 , who wed her partner of more than 23 years			0
" in that sense , it 's amazing			0
" @entity10 -- who works for @entity15 , an entity that includes @entity16 -- and her partner were one of 57 couples to get same - sex marriage licenses in @entity20 , according to county clerk @entity21			1
@entity21 , a @entity22 elected to the county clerk post , said that she personally performed 30 ceremonies in @entity25			1
" today was an awesome day , " @entity21 tweeted			0
not all county clerks followed suit by taking the abnormal step of opening up their offices on a weekend			0
but there were a few others , such as in @entity32 , according to @entity16 affiliate @entity33			0
there , in @entity36 , @entity34 and @entity35 arrived early for the chance to marry after 26 years together			2
@entity34 told @entity33 that " we wanted to get married as soon as possible " in the wake of the court ruling issued late friday afternoon			1
their motivation was simple : " we love each other , and we want to make sure that we protect each other			0
" as to being among the first gay couples married in @entity3 , @entity34 said , " it 's historic , and we 're glad we 're a part of it			1
and we are just happy			0
" there 's a chance that their marriage could be among the last , too			2
@entity3 attorney general @entity55 , a @entity57 whose term expires later this year , announced on friday evening he 'd filed an emergency request for @entity61 district judge @entity60 's order to be stayed and appealed			1
" in 2004 , the citizens of @entity3 recognized that diversity in parenting is best for kids and families because moms and dads are not interchangeable , " @entity55 said			1
" @entity3 voters enshrined that decision in our state constitution , and their will should stand and be respected			1
" the @entity73 issued an order saturday to temporarily stay through at least wednesday the decision by @entity60			1
in its brief order , the court explained that it did so " to allow a more reasoned consideration of the motion to stay			1
" earlier , the same court had said that those opposed to @entity55 's request have until noon tuesday to respond			2
it 's not immediately clear what will happen , then , with the same - sex marriages that took place earlier saturday			1
@entity10 said she is n't surprised by the stay and is bracing for the idea she and @entity89 wo n't immediately have full benefits available to them in @entity3 -- though she expects that , at least , they 'll now have federal benefits available to marriage same - sex couples			1
" it is what we expected , " @entity10 said			2
" we know that we are on the right side of history			0
" in fact , @entity60 's ruling was the latest in a series of recent district judge decisions -- which have also affected @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 -- striking down state laws restricting marriage to one man and one woman			1
judges later issued stays of those decisions until higher courts weigh in			2
@entity117 , a professor at the @entity119 's law school , explained that appellate judges must weigh in on all these cases			0
the @entity122 likely wo n't add its input until its next term , which starts in october			0
still , the trend in the courts -- which also happens to mirror that in public opinion polls -- so far is clear			0
" it 's all in one direction right now , " @entity117 said			0
regardless of the fact her situation is in limbo , @entity10 and her partner are celebrating , nonetheless			0
they have family members expressing joy and solidarity along with them , such as a brother - in - law who noted the two are finally " acting out what 's been in place for years			2
" but most importantly , they have their 16 - year - old daughter to savor the moment with -- who they were able to jointly adopt years ago in @entity147 and who was at her parents ' wedding ceremony in @entity25			2
" she 's excited about it , " @entity10 said .			0
