-- @entity3 intelligence has n't broken any laws in sharing data with its @entity7 counterparts in counterterrorism efforts , foreign secretary @entity1 said sunday			1
" the idea that in @entity14 people ( @entity3 intelligence ) are sitting working out how to circumvent a @entity3 law with another agency in another country is fanciful , " @entity1 told the @entity10 , referring to @entity3 's communications intelligence agency			1
" it is nonsense , and i think that i can give people that assurance			0
" @entity14 is the acronym for @entity14 , a @entity3 intelligence agency			2
@entity1 spoke after a week of revelations about the scale of data - gathering by @entity14 's @entity7 counterpart , the @entity25			1
@entity3 's the @entity26 reported saturday that @entity14 had access to an @entity7 data - mining system known as @entity29 , suggesting it could " circumvent the formal legal process " required to seek personal data under @entity3 law			1
@entity1 did n't confirm or deny whether @entity3 intelligence received information from the @entity7 programs			1
but the @entity7 and @entity3 have shared intelligence since @entity35 , and @entity1 said @entity3 law " provides for intelligence - gathering that is authorized , necessary , proportionate and targeted -- targeted on what we really need to know			1
" @entity25 leaker comes forward " the net effect is that if you are a law - abiding citizen of this country , going about your business and your personal life , you have nothing to fear -- nothing to fear about the @entity3 state or intelligence agencies listening to the contents of your phone calls or anything like that , " he said			1
" indeed , you 'll never be aware of all the things those agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen and to stop a terrorist blowing you up tomorrow			0
" but if you are a would - be terrorist or the center of a criminal network or a foreign intelligence agency trying to spy on @entity3 , you should be worried , because that is what we work on , " he continued			1
" and we are , on the whole , quite good at it			0
" how does it affect me ? wednesday , the @entity26 disclosed a secret order from a @entity7 intelligence court that required @entity70 to give telephone records detailing the time , location and telephone numbers involved in domestic calls from april 25 to july 19			2
thursday , the @entity76 and the @entity26 disclosed the existence of @entity29 , reporting that the program allows @entity25 analysts to extract details of customer activities -- including " audio and video chats , photographs , e-mails , documents " and other materials -- from computers at @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and other internet firms			0
in the wake of the revelations , the @entity7 government declassified some details of the programs and defended the programs as both legal and valuable to heading off the threat of terrorism			2
director of national intelligence @entity101 said saturday the surveillance programs are " conducted under authorities widely known and discussed , and fully debated and authorized by @entity104			2
" " in a rush to publish , media outlets have not given the full context -- including the extent to which these programs are overseen by all three branches of government , " @entity101 said			0
data mining revelation opens political @entity114 @entity7 officials said earlier that phone - call data is n't looked at unless investigators sense a tie to terror , and only then on the authority of a judge			1
officials say analysts are forbidden from collecting the internet activity of @entity7 citizens or residents , even when they travel overseas			2
and president @entity126 tried to reassure @entity7 about the programs friday , saying , " nobody is listening to your telephone calls			2
" @entity101 's office called @entity29 " an internal government computer system used to facilitate the government 's statutorily authorized collection of foreign intelligence information from electronic communication service providers under court supervision			0
" it was created in 2008 , targets " foreign targets located outside the @entity7 " and gets reviewed by the administration , @entity104 and judges			0
" there is not a target on @entity7 , " rep. @entity143 , the chairman of the @entity144 , told reporters sunday			1
" there has to be a non- @entity7 person believed to be on foreign soil			0
that is a huge difference than what is being portrayed in the media , " said @entity143 , @entity151			0
but @entity158 @entity157 sen. @entity156 , who 's long called for greater transparency in how the government collects data on @entity7 , said the legal authority should be reopened for debate after last week 's disclosures			2
some shrug at snooping : privacy 's already dead " maybe @entity7 think this is ok , but i think the line has been drawn too far towards ' we 're going to invade your privacy , ' versus ' we 're going to respect your privacy , ' " @entity156 told @entity0 's " @entity174			1
" @entity156 is a member of the @entity175			0
he and sen. @entity176 , @entity177 , have criticized the scope of the classified programs that allow the collection of @entity7 ' phone records -- but have been limited in what they could say publicly			0
@entity156 told @entity0 that claims that the monitoring has thwarted terrorist attacks are overblown			0
" it 's unclear to me we 've developed any intelligence through the metadata program that 's led to the disruption of plots that could have been attained through other means , " @entity156 said , pushing back on assertions by both administration officials and @entity143 intelligence chairman @entity143 that a specific plot was stopped using the massive collection of phone records			1
opinion : where 's the evidence that data mining saves lives ? @entity0 's @entity203 contributed to this report .			0

" law - abiding " @entity3 have nothing to fear from surveillance , @entity1 says
@entity7 officials defend electronic data collections
" there is not a target on @entity7 , " @entity144 intelligence chairman says
