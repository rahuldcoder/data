-- @entity1 started receiving professional tennis coaching at the age of eight			2
since then his father has worked hard to cover his training costs			2
two years on and it all seems to have paid off			2
in june , a local @entity8 company reached out to @entity9 , @entity1 's father , with an offer to sponsor @entity1			1
soon after , a professional photographer took pictures of @entity1 and his father for advertisements			0
but the family 's happiness was short lived			0
the company withdrew the sponsorship			0
though he says he was never given an explanation , @entity1 's father believes it was because of his political activity			1
the company could not be reached for comment			0
as a controversial blogger and writer , @entity9 announced his plan to run for office as an independent candidate for @entity29 's @entity28 of @entity30 , a legislative body at the local level in @entity34 province			1
" you never know the benefit of standing up if you always stay on your knees , " @entity9 declared in a campaign statement on his microblog , where he has more than three million regular followers			1
through the power of social media , @entity9 's original message was forwarded more than 3,000 times within a few hours on micro-blogging site @entity45 , a popular twitter - like service			0
but such campaigns are rare in @entity29			1
the @entity29 do not choose their own president or premier because all government officials are pre-decided			1
however , elections are held on the local level , with all candidates approved by the party beforehand			1
@entity29 's electoral law stipulates that every @entity29 citizen over 18 has the right to vote and run in local elections			1
those , like @entity9 , seeking to become candidates for county or township legislatures must first register and secure confirmation of their candidacy			1
they must then be nominated as " deputy candidate " by political parties , social organizations or have the signed support of at least 10 registered voters in their constituency			1
in practice , the government can rule candidates or any of their supporters unqualified and refuse to put them on the ballot , which critics say leaves ample opportunity for manipulation of the results			2
" i know nobody on the ballot sheet			0
and i do n't think my vote will make much difference , " a retiree in @entity87 said when she was asked to vote for the @entity90 's @entity28 district 's last election			0
in recent months , an unprecedented number of @entity29 citizens have declared themselves as independent candidates , according to @entity96 , founder of the world and @entity99 that promotes democracy at the local levels			1
he said many candidates have grievances with the local government and feel they can not get their voices out			1
" they bid for the position as they think they can draw attention from the public for better solving of the problem , " he said			0
" some local governments did think that their leadership was threatened by these ( independent candidates ) , which is obviously not the case			1
some believe there are concerns among the central government as well			0
on june 8 , state - run media @entity119 quoted the head of the @entity122 of the @entity123 as saying that " there is no such a thing as an ' independent candidate ' as it 's not recognized by law			2
" all candidates must follow the guidelines laid out by the government			2
but some do manage to meet the guidelines and run under the banner of an independent			2
the history of @entity29 's independent candidates dates back to 1998 , when @entity136 , a teacher in @entity137 , became the first self - described independent candidate elected to the local congress			1
he lost out when attempting a bid for a second term in 2003			0
with the government in control of the media and potential candidates subject to government approval , many question whether a truly independent candidate can win			1
@entity96 says more than 100 people -- many using the internet -- have declared themselves as candidates for upcoming elections for people 's congresses across the country			1
" there are no fair and free elections in @entity29 , " said @entity96			1
" chances are not good for these people leading the wave , but with their appeals , a lot more people will stand out to join in the election			0
" no matter what the chances are for @entity9 , he says he is determined			0
" in @entity29 , there is so much unfairness and many choices in life are decided by the others , " he explained during an interview with @entity0			1
" i want to make decisions on my own			0
" to achieve his goal , @entity9 has visited more than 100 residents in his constituency , listening to their appeals to work out his campaign plan , trying to secure the government - required support from 10 registered voters			0
he also continues to speak out on his blog			0
@entity9 is not sure whether his name will appear on the ballot in september , when the election process officially begins , but he tries to be optimistic			0
if i 'm not confident , how can i convince my supporters ? " he said			0
@entity9 is not so confident about securing another tennis sponsorship for his son , if his political activities indeed caused him to lose the first one			2
he says he plans to fight on as an independent -- and he has his son 's support			2
