@entity0 -- the @entity3 health care bill is not worthy of the historic vote that the @entity5 took a month ago			1
even though the @entity5 version is far from perfect , it at least represents a step toward our goal of giving 36 million @entity11 decent health coverage			0
but under the @entity3 plan , millions of @entity11 will be forced into private insurance company plans , which will be subsidized by taxpayers			2
that alternative will do almost nothing to reform health care but will be a windfall for insurance companies			1
is it any surprise that stock prices for some of those insurers are up recently ? i do not want to subsidize the private insurance market ; the whole point of creating a government option is to bring prices down			2
insisting on a government mandate to have insurance without a better alternative to the status quo is not true reform			0
by eliminating the public option , the government program that could spark competition within the health insurance industry , the @entity3 has ended up with a bill that is n't worthy of its support			1
the public option is the part of our reform effort that will lower costs , improve the delivery of health care services and force insurance companies to offer rates and services that are reasonable			1
although the art of legislating involves compromise , i believe the @entity3 went off the rails when it agreed with the @entity55 to water down the reform bill and no longer include the public option			1
but that 's not the only thing wrong with the @entity3 's version of the health care bill			1
under that plan , insurance companies can punish older people , charging them much higher rates than the @entity5 bill would allow			0
in the @entity5 , we fought hard to repeal @entity67 , the antitrust exemption that insurance companies have enjoyed for years			0
we did that because we believed firmly that those @entity72 corporations should not enjoy special treatment			0
yet the @entity3 bill does not include that provision -- despite assurances from some members that they will seek to add it			1
by ending that protection , we will be able to go after insurance companies with federal penalties for misleading advertising or dishonest business practices			0
the @entity5 bill would cover 96 percent of legal residents , while the @entity3 covers 94 percent			2
compared with the @entity5 bill , the @entity3 's bill makes it much easier for employers to avoid the responsibility of providing insurance for their workers			1
and of course , the @entity3 bill did not remove the onerous choice language intended to appeal to anti-abortion forces			1
now do n't get me wrong ; the current @entity5 and @entity3 bills are a significant improvement over the status quo			2
given the hard path to reform and the political realities of next year , there is a sizable group within @entity102 that wants to simply cut any deal that works and call it a success			0
many previous efforts have failed , and the path to reform is littered with unsuccessful efforts championed by @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
supporters of the weak @entity3 bill say " just pass it -- any bill is better than no bill			1
" i strongly disagree -- a conference report is unlikely to sufficiently bridge the gap between these two very different bills			0
it 's time that we draw the line on this weak bill and ask the @entity3 to go back to the drawing board			2
the @entity11 people deserve at least that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity130 .			0

@entity3 bill is n't worthy of being called health reform , says rep. @entity130 ( @entity134 - @entity135 )
@entity130 , who heads @entity137 , says lack of public option is a fatal flaw
she says @entity3 bill would not stir competition among big insurance firms
@entity130 : @entity3 needs to go back and start over on health care
