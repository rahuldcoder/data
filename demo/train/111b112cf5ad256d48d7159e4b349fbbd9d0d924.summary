@entity0 -- the @entity3 position on extraterrestrials is now clear : aliens have n't contacted @entity6 , but that does n't mean the @entity9 government is n't looking for them			1
" the @entity9 government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet , or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race , " wrote @entity10 of the @entity11 in a blog post on the @entity3 website			1
the response went on to say that even though there is no proof that life exists outside @entity6 , " that does n't mean the subject of life outside our planet is n't being discussed or explored , " he said the petitions were submitted through " @entity33 , " a @entity3 initiative that promises a @entity3 response to any petition that can garner 5,000 signatures in 30 days			1
this response by the @entity3 satisfies the demands of two petitions , one of which garnered over 12,000 signatures			0
that petition called on the @entity3 to " formally acknowledge an extraterrestrial presence engaging the human race			1
" " hundreds of military and government agency witnesses have come forward with testimony confirming this extraterrestrial presence , " stated the petition			2
" opinion polls now indicate more than 50 % of the @entity9 people believe there is an extraterrestrial presence and more than 80 % believe the government is not telling the truth about this phenomenon			1
the people have a right to know			0
the people can handle the truth			0
" according to the @entity3 , however , " there is no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public 's eye			2
" but @entity10 indicated that a host of government agencies are working " toward the goal of understanding if life can or does exist off @entity6 , " including the @entity61 , @entity62 , the @entity62 and @entity63 , the @entity65 spacecraft			0
and even though the @entity3 was clear that there is no credible evidence that aliens have contacted earth , @entity10 did point out that the odds are in favor of extraterrestrial existence , but not contact			2
" many scientists and mathematicians ... have come to the conclusion that the odds are pretty high that somewhere among the trillions and trillions of stars in the universe there is a planet other than ours that is home to life , " wrote @entity10			0
" however , that the odds of us making contact with any of them â € ” especially any intelligent ones â € ” are extremely small , given the distances involved			0

the @entity3 says extraterrestrials have not contacted the human race
the @entity9 government says there 's no evidence of life outside our planet
thousands sign a petition asking for a government response on alien contact
many @entity9 believe in an extraterrestrial presence
