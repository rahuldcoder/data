" with 26 statuettes to be handed out , the three - hour @entity10 broadcast from the @entity11 in downtown @entity0 should be packed with hastened acceptance speeches , but at least some drama			2
" @entity7 " has dominated the best drama category in its four seasons and could set a record with a fifth - straight win this year , but @entity19 's psychological thriller " homeland , " which just started a second season , and @entity22 's " @entity21 " may stand in its way			1

" it was presented at the @entity35 's creative arts ceremony last week			2
@entity10 's " @entity90 , " the country 's highest - rated sitcom , will try to repeat its domination of the @entity35 's comedy categories			1
