@entity8 will take on @entity9 in sunday 's final of the @entity11 in @entity12 in a battle of two players who have promised so much , but fallen frustratingly short			1
@entity8 's fortunes have taken a remarkable turn for the better since @entity17 called off their wedding -- with a phone call -- in may			1
while the golfer regained his best form immediately , winning two major titles in a month , @entity8 's resurgence has been more gradual -- culminating in defeat to @entity25 in this month 's @entity27 final			1
the @entity28 , who won the @entity12 title in 2010 , is seeking the 23rd @entity31 crown of her career , and second this year following july 's @entity34 success			1
she had to show her renowned fighting qualities on saturday before battling to a 6 - 4 2 - 6 6 - 2 win over 20 - year - old @entity39 @entity38 , who this season has reached the first two finals of her career , winning one of them			2
" she was playing really , really well and very aggressively , but i just kept fighting and staying in there , and i think at the end i had just a little bit more energy than she did , " @entity8 said after her 22nd win in 26 matches since the hard - court swing began			2
the 24 - year - old needs to improve on her 2 - 4 career record against @entity9 , who holds the last of eight qualifying places in the race to feature at the season - ending championships in @entity57 -- @entity8 is ninth , with five slots yet to be decided			1
the @entity59 , who had an on - off relationship with @entity63 golfer @entity62 earlier this decade , has won three of her five finals in 2014 after rebuilding her game and ranking			0
unlike @entity67 , she has a grand slam title to her name -- the @entity68 -- but has not done so well in this season 's majors since reaching the @entity73 quarterfinals in january			2
@entity9 lost in the 2007 @entity12 final before it became a premier - level event on the tour , and the 26 - year - old has another chance for @entity81 success after knocking out top seed @entity82 in saturday 's semifinals			1
she came back from 5 - 3 down in the opening set , winning 10 of the next 13 games to triumph 7 - 5 6 - 3 against the @entity86 -- who lost to @entity88 in last year 's final			2
" in the beginning it really took me some time to adjust to her game			0
it was n't like my previous matches , " @entity9 said after her 51st win this season , equaling her career best achieved seven years ago			0
" but once i adjusted and got more aggressive it started to go my way , and i 'm really happy with the win today because she 's always such a tough and challenging opponent			0
" meanwhile , @entity102 's @entity101 won the second @entity31 title of her career saturday , beating @entity105 's @entity104 6 - 4 6 - 0 in the final of the @entity107			1
