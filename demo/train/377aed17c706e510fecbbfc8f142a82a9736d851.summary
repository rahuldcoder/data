-- most craftsmen bask in glory when others admire and gush over their art , but a compliment is the last thing @entity7 wants			1
" i do n't want the general public to know what i do is fake , " @entity7 says			1
" it 's best if it 's not noticed at all			0
" @entity7 is an ocularist , or trained technician who makes prosthetic eyes			1
while some call it a skill , @entity7 says recreating the " personality , " " emotion " and " sparkle " conveyed in a person 's eye is an art. each eye " tells a story and reflects a lot , " @entity7 explains			1
@entity7 and her son @entity28 are two of the six ocularists in the state of @entity31 and among the few hundred in the country			1
because no school teaches ocularistry , people who want to enter the profession must spend 10,000 hours , or five years , of apprenticeship to become certified			1
the career blends the fields of art and science -- as only people with a creative side and anatomical knowledge can duplicate the organ that gives the gift of sight			0
it 's a common misconception that prosthetic eyes are made of glass , but they 're actually designed using acrylic materials and paint			1
the only nonacrylic piece is the silk thread placed on the eye 's surface to simulate veins			0
today , no member of the @entity59 of @entity60 , which includes 200 professional ocularists in the @entity62 and @entity63 , makes glass eyes , according to @entity65 , the society 's education chairwoman			2
she explained that acrylic eyes last longer , fit easier and can better match the color of the original eye			2
" there are n't many people left who make glass eyes , " says @entity65 , who has been an ocularist for more than 25 years in @entity71			1
the art of eye making dates back to the fifth century @entity78 , when @entity79 and @entity80 painted clay eyes and wore them over eye sockets			2
in the 1500s , the @entity83 crafted blown - glass eyes that could be worn inside the sockets , but the globes were uncomfortable and sometimes shattered			2
it was n't until @entity89 that eye makers switched from glass to acrylic , because @entity62 could n't import glass from @entity94			1
to their delight , ocularists found acrylic eyes did n't break like glass ones and the material was more flexible to mold			1
for several decades , stock eyes were mass produced as a one - size - fits - all concept			0
but production has since evolved into the handmade craft of today that brings makers and patients together to custom fit the perfect eye			0
@entity7 , who has crafted prosthetic eyes for 30 years , took up the trade after her son @entity110 lost his eye in an accident			1
@entity110 , who was 3 years old at the time , was watching his father fix a tractor when a bolt flew off into his eye			0
@entity110 was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery , but the eye was damaged beyond repair			0
the @entity121 decided to get @entity110 a prosthetic eye before he entered kindergarten so kids would n't taunt him about his shrunken and callused eye			2
" we wanted him of course to be whole again and have nobody notice it , " @entity7 says , adding that she would have traded places with her son if she could have			1
" you 're watching your child go through this , you 'd give anything to have it be yourself instead of them , " she says			0
after agonizing over @entity110 's lost sight and overcoming the pain by seeing him " made whole " again , @entity7 decided she wanted to help others erase the suffering she had felt			1
@entity7 apprenticed in between raising four kids , and eight years later she had her professional ocularist license			1
@entity7 's younger son @entity143 tossed around the idea of attending medical school , but ultimately decided to follow his mother 's path and become an ocularist			1
the two run @entity149 in @entity150 , @entity31 , where thousands of patients have come through their doors			0
@entity7 , 58 , and @entity28 , 36 , make their patients ' eyes together			1
while @entity28 says he has friends who could never work with their mothers , both @entity7 and @entity157 say they love collaborating on a project that takes 30 to 40 hours to complete			1
" it 's helpful to have someone come in who has n't been staring at ( an eye ) for an hour and a half and say , ' oh , you 're missing this color ' or ' i think you need to start again , ' which thankfully does n't happen that often , " @entity28 joked			2
despite being a very specialized field , it 's not in danger of losing professionals			0
similar to @entity7 and @entity157 's business , the art form tends to be passed down within families			2
members of the @entity59 of @entity60 are mostly second - , third - and fourth - generation ocularists			0
most patients seek a prosthetic eye -- which costs around $ 3,000 -- after an accident or disease such as cancer or diabetes			2
@entity7 says more people lose their eyes to disease than injuries today , but she has seen accidents involving bungee cords , golf balls and rocks flying out of lawn mowers			1
" there 's still the typical ' @entity193 ' of the bb gun injuries , " she added			0
less than 1 % of the population requires an ocular prosthesis , according to @entity65 , who says she often sees people in public who could benefit from one			0
" i think there are a lot of people out there that do n't realize they would be a good candidate for an ocular prosthesis , and they do n't realize that 's something they can get , " she says			0
@entity208 , @entity31 , resident @entity209 , who lost an eye in a skiing accident 16 years ago , recently got a prosthetic eye from @entity7			1
he compared his new blue eye to contact lenses			0
" when you first get them , you 're quite aware of them , but after a while , you do n't even notice it , " @entity209 says			0
in the past few months @entity209 has worn the eye , he 's noticed a difference in the way people respond to him			0
he pointed out one interaction with a @entity227 employee stationed at the exit			0
" about 10 feet before i got to her , she gasped and said , ' oh , my @entity231 , you 've got the most gorgeous blue eyes , ' " he recounts while laughing			0
@entity7 wishes no one needed her talents but says she 's honored when patients let her into their lives to aid the healing process			2
" it 's an amazing thing to be able to be a part of somebody 's life and that transformation from the tragedy , the grief ... and for us to be able to just heal , pray and love them through it , " @entity7 says			2
" and also ( give them ) a dang good - looking eye			0

@entity7 became an ocularist after her son lost his eye in an accident

it takes 10,000 hours of apprentice work to become a certified ocularist
