-- an @entity2 inmate seeks to exercise what he says is a key tenet of his faith , but corrections officials cite security concerns in their refusal to accommodate			1
the issue comes down to a half - inch beard , and this claim of religious liberty within prison walls will now be debated by the @entity14			1
the justices will kick off the first week of their new term with a one - hour oral argument tuesday			2
the case will be another major test of the government 's ability to justify a range of policies that might restrict religious accommodation -- from the @entity26 health law to workplace hiring			1
@entity27 , also known as @entity28 , is a muslim who filed a handwritten petition with the high court			1
he cites rights under the federal @entity34 , or @entity34			2
the state responds that inmate beards could pose a security risk to guards and the public : prisoners who escape could shave their facial hair , altering their appearance			1
and weapons and other contraband could be hidden in heavy beards or inside their cheeks , covered by facial hair			2
current @entity2 prison policy allows only a " neatly trimmed mustache			1
" the @entity51 administration is backing @entity27 , and some legal analysts say that could ultimately sway the justices , who have traditionally been deferential to the security judgments of prison officers			1
" it 's all about whether or not there is a compelling government interest that 's being put forth in the least restrictive way possible , " said @entity58 , chief counsel at the @entity59 , a progressive legal think tank			2
" and here , maybe @entity2 has n't met its burden for saying it can limit a person 's ability to grow a beard when his religion compels him to do so			1
" the beard case is one of three high - profile disputes over religion that will be heard by the justices in coming weeks			2
one involves a federal law allowing @entity77 citizens born in the holy city of @entity79 to list the county of origin on their passports as " @entity83 " or " @entity84			2
" right now , those passports list no country , a reflection of the disputed control over the region			0
president @entity51 and his predecessor have resisted the congressional mandate , saying it interferes with his executive power to recognize independent sovereigns			2
and the court will hear arguments over whether local governments can impose stricter regulations on temporary church signs than on other noncommercial displays , such as lost - dog posters and political campaign banners typically displayed along streets in the weeks before an election			0
the tiny @entity105 is challenging a @entity108 suburb 's ordinance , saying it hurts efforts to attract new members to its services in a rented facility			0
prison safety vs. religious freedom administrative directive 98 - @entity116 of the @entity117 permits beards only for those " with a diagnosed dermatological problem			1
" but in his self - initiated plea to the justices , @entity27 complained that he and fellow @entity123 were forced " to either obey their religious beliefs and face disciplinary action on the one hand , or violate those beliefs in order to acquiesce " to the facial hair policy			1
he cited the @entity131 -- literary traditions and sayings of the @entity134 -- which says , " @entity136 said , ' cut the mustaches short and leave the beard ( as it is )			0
' " @entity27 said he offered to keep his beard to a half - inch as a " compromise , " but that was rejected			1
the @entity142 has offered its support , saying more than 40 states and the federal correctional system allow beards of varying lengths			0
" when @entity152 enacted @entity34 , it made clear that courts should accord deference to prison administrators ' considered judgments about how to run safe and efficient prisons , " @entity51 administration lawyers told the court in a written brief			1
" @entity152 also made clear , however , that such deference is not due when a prison justifies a restriction based on exaggerated fears or mere speculation			0
" the state obviously sees things differently			0
@entity27 is housed at the @entity165 , a 468 - bed , ultra-maximum security section of the correctional facility in @entity168 , @entity2 , near @entity169			1
officials point to inmate 129 - 616 's self - admission as a " @entity174 - trained @entity173 fundamentalist " with a violent criminal past			0
he had been indicted by a federal grand jury for threatening to harm then - president @entity178 's two daughters			0
a few years later , he was convicted in state court and sentenced to life in prison for breaking into the home of his ex-girlfriend and severely wounding her , slitting her throat and stabbing her in the chest			2
law enforcement officials say he threatened to wage " jihad " against anyone who helped convict him , both at trial and later behind bars			0
so state leaders had a simple message for the courts : allow us room to decide which restrictions work best within each institution 's unique circumstances			0
" prisons are dangerous places ... officials create rules intended to strike a delicate balance between safety and security , on the one hand , and giving inmates a sense of dignity and achieving rehabilitative goals , on the other hand , " said the @entity2 brief to the high court			1
corrections officials take " religious freedom seriously , " but they also take seriously their " paramount interests in safety and security , too			1
" @entity220 case connection @entity27 is being defended in court by the @entity222 , the same nonprofit group that backed two @entity224 families in a separate high court challenge earlier this year			2
at issue there was whether a federal law permitted closely held family - owned corporations the discretion to deny contraception coverage in employer - funded insurance plans			0
the conservative court dealt a setback to the @entity235 and @entity26 supporters in the so - called @entity220 dispute , saying those with " sincerely held " religious beliefs had a limited right to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace			0
the @entity222 noted that groups like the @entity244 and the @entity245 , along with catholic bishops , are now backing the inmate			0
" the across - the - board support for mr. @entity28 shows that religious liberty remains one of the bedrock ideals of @entity77 , " said @entity248 , the group 's deputy general counsel			0
" whether we treat prisoners with basic human dignity -- including the freedom to seek @entity258 -- speaks volumes about who we are as a nation			0
" some conservative groups noted that the federal government was supporting @entity27 in the religious liberty fight while opposing the @entity224 business owners in the " @entity220 " appeals			1
" the question is do we hold that religious freedom applies even when we do n't agree with the religious principles of the person here , " said @entity267 , chief counsel for the @entity268			1
" the @entity51 administration does n't necessarily have as consistent a position			1
they were against it when it came to the @entity279 and @entity280 families exercising their religious freedom , and they 're all for it with prisoner beards			1
" the @entity14 has debated the issue of body grooming and liberty before			0
in 1879 , justice @entity287 struck down @entity289 's @entity288 , which required an inmate 's hair in the county jail be cut to a " uniform length of one inch from the scalp			0
" @entity295 , a @entity296 immigrant laborer , had been arrested for living in overcrowded tenement conditions , a misdemeanor offense designed to reduce unsanitary , dangerous living spaces			0
his pigtail was cut , and @entity295 protested , saying the policy violated " the religious faith of the @entity296 " natives			2
@entity287 agreed , concluding that the ordinance on long braids went against the @entity306 by " acting with special severity upon @entity296 prisoners , inflicting upon them suffering altogether disproportionate to what would be endured by other prisoners			0
" the current @entity2 dispute is @entity27 v. @entity313 ( 13 - 6827 )			1
a ruling is expected in a few months .			0
