-- a couple of weeks ago , three guys from a @entity3 band sat down for an interview			1
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 are in the band @entity9			1
it was their first national media interview , and almost immediately , they shared their plans for the weekend			2
" we 're going to a nude beach , " @entity8 said			2
" " outside of @entity17 with hopefully a bunch of hippies , " said @entity7			2
" we 're going to be the creepiest guys there , " @entity8 said			2
" i 'm bringing my digital camera			2
@entity9 have been described as purveyors of slacker - pop , as hipsters , and as ' 90s indie rock copy - cats			1
and it 's easy to get the impression that they just do n't care			2
the members all share a humor laced with quirk , and often their songs seem to fall apart at times , right before they come back together			1
" i think the sound of [ our songs ] is kind of misleading , " @entity6 said			1
" if it sounds a little sloppy , it means we 're not the most proficient musicians			0
" and often , through their videos and in their album cover art , it seems @entity9 is clothing - averse			1
male nudity , not exactly a staple of rock and roll , is a constant theme			0
" we all have great body images , " @entity7 deadpanned			0
an @entity51 band something you should know about the @entity9 ' twentysomething band members : they care about more than just playing music and hanging out in the nude			1
right now , @entity3 is in the middle of a contentious legislative recall election			0
the recalls stem from a political fight over the state budget , public employee unions and public school teachers ' benefits			0
the band spoke at length about what they saw as the unfair treatment of public - sector employees , and about the self - imposed racial segregation of @entity72			1
" i feel living in @entity3 , a lot of the stuff is affecting us in big ways ... and makes [ our concern ] more immediate than before , " @entity7 said			0
but , instead of writing politically charged songs or throwing themselves into election - year fights , the band has focused on poking fun at societal outrages			1
when there were national calls to ban the alcoholic @entity87 drinks , the band featured the beverages heavily in their video for ' @entity90			1
' @entity6 said there are other bands that can tackle politics , and what it means to be an @entity51 , much more effectively			0
and all the members of the band said they do n't pretend to have the life experience needed to write socially conscious songs			1
" we 're not into wearing this kind of seriousness on our sleeves , " @entity7 says			0
" like ' we suffered over this			0
' " still , there is a hint of political awareness , even in the band 's name : @entity9 is an anagram for @entity51			1
poised for a breakthrough one of the group 's biggest backers is @entity112			0
he runs the music site , @entity114			0
like most of @entity9 ' fans , he heard their songs after a friend sent him a link to the band 's website			1
" i listened to it and it was instantly rock and roll , a type of rock and roll i had been missing , " @entity112 said			0
" i think this band has so much potential			1
and i really think once people hear them for the first time ... it 's going to be really hard for people to resist those songs			1
" each member of the band helps write songs , each member has equal input			1
right now the band is content with the success they 've achieved			2
they 've been mentioned in @entity142			0
the @entity145 's @entity144 blog listed " @entity149 " as one of the greatest videos of all time			0
and each week , the band gets e-mails from new fans around the country who stumbled onto the band			2
" i think one of the best kinds of success , " @entity6 said , " is having people write us an e-mail saying they like what we 're doing			2
" " yeah , this one guy told us he had sex with his girlfriend in his grandparents ' bed while listening to our album , " @entity7 interjected			0
@entity6 paused , and said he did n't know how he felt about that			0
" i feel pretty good about it , " @entity7 responded .			0
