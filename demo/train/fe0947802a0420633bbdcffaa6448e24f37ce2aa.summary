-- the first emotion i remember is rage			1
it was a violent , fire - in - your - veins , so angry - you - could - kill - someone kind of rage			1
i wanted the pain to be over			1
i was mad at myself for not having the courage to just do it quickly , angry at the hospital staff for thwarting my masked attempt			1
i was convinced that i was " meant to " endure this , that my long , drawn - out starving to death would prove my willpower to @entity15			1
in the days prior to my stroke , i 'd had vivid hallucinations -- of @entity18 on a wooden cross outside my bedroom window and a satanic figure sneaking up under my bedroom covers to suffocate me at night			1
i thought i was meant to be a martyr			1
i thought @entity15 wanted me to die			1
as the fury subsided , delirium set in			1
i became confused , defiant and completely irrational			2
i told the doctors that they could n't possibly keep me overnight , because my family did n't have insurance or money to pay			2
when a cardiologist responded that she was n't sure if i 'd live another week , i told her she was full of s ---			2
i hid the food they were trying to make me eat in my underwear , in flowerpots , even in my cheeks like a chipmunk -- certain no one would notice			2
i did n't want to get better			2
i was convinced nothing was wrong			2
i remember having nurses turn me over in the middle of the night to tend to the bed sores on my behind , places where the skin was so thin that my tailbone was starting to protrude through the flesh			2
i remember waking up to discover i 'd wet the bed nearly every morning for the first three months i was hospitalized			1
i was ashamed , disgusted			2
i 'd lost control of the muscles in my bladder ; i was like an infant all over again			2
i remember shooting a nurse the bird when she told me i could n't walk , only to crumble to the floor when i angrily pushed the wheelchair away to give it a try			2
a boy and his seizure dog unbeknownst to me at the time , my arrival at the hospital had launched an investigation by @entity65 back at my home in @entity67			1
the caseworkers deemed my mother an " unfit parent " and my sister and i were placed under custodianship of the state			0
my care was left to the doctors and nurses at @entity77 , while my sister was sent to live with our godparents			0
my mother , herself an alcoholic and anorexic , had literally drunk herself into oblivion ( she was later diagnosed with @entity83 , a form of alcohol - induced dementia )			0
i spent the next 16 months of my life in that hospital			1
i completed my junior and senior years of high school through a distance education program , talked my way through hundreds of hours of individual and group therapy and slowly , painfully worked to bring my body and mind back to life			1
when @entity97 finally pulled the plug on funding for my treatment , i was unrecognizable from the day i 'd walked in			0
i 'd gained nearly 40 pounds , and the feisty , fiercely independent spirit i 'd been known for as a child was on her way back in ( close to ) full force			1
although i was still significantly underweight and terrified to leave the security of the hospital , my medical team managed to convince the caseworkers to grant me emancipation			0
at 17 , i re-entered the " real world " as a legally recognized adult			0
my doctor at @entity77 helped me make arrangements to move into a garage apartment with a close family friend near the hospital			0
i got a job at a local @entity118 , started applying for college , and , by the grace of who - knows - what , was offered almost free weekly therapy by a psychologist who 'd treated me at @entity77			0
three months later , i took my first yoga class			1
i was given enough resources to put the fragments of my broken life back together			1
6 years later , burned @entity130 boy stands tall my hope is that my story might serve as a beacon of hope for people grappling with their own inner demons in silence and isolation			1
whether it 's an eating disorder , abandonment , depression or addiction , please know : there is a way out			0
you do n't have to suffer alone			0
there are people out there who want to love you , who would be honored to bear witness to your pain			0
@entity152 does n't happen in a vacuum			0
we are human and we have an inherent need to see and be seen , to touch and be touched			0
no one heals heartbreak alone			0
for the broader community , i hope this story will diminish some of the stigma and misperceptions about eating disorders			1
many of us have been taught that people with eating disorders simply want to be skinny , feel like they have to look like supermodels to be worth anything , or just have an unhealthy " need for control			0
" those are all symptoms of an eating disorder , not the cause			0
i realized that i feel like a child who was once desperately thirsty , who was given enough water to survive and shake her thirst , and now feels compelled to go out and give water to anyone who 's parched			0
" look ! water ! i know , is n't it good ? ! drink up ! ! " when i see people drink the water , i ca n't even describe the feeling -- it 's as if i 'm experiencing the first sip all over again			0
it brings me incredible joy , even healing			0
it 's an act of alchemy			0
it allows me to make light of some of the darkest days of my life			1
i once had a therapist who , when asked how i could ever repay her for all she 'd given me , told me : " your life will be all the thanks i need			1
" this is how i thank her			0
this is how i thank all those who helped me find my way out of the darkness			0
