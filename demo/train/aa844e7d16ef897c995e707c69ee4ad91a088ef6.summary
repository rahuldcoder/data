-- when @entity2 announced his campaign for president last summer , he received the type of media attention that presumed he would be an immediate and formidable challenger for the @entity8 nomination			1
unlike other early casualties like @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity2 did not self - destruct			1
there was no spectacular immolation or flameout that rocked the political world , nor had there been the type of stratospheric rise that marked @entity10 and @entity11 's campaigns			0
instead , there was just a long , steady flatline , with maybe the slightest sign of a heartbeat in the days before the @entity25 primary , but far too little and too late to make any difference			2
it was only in the superheated world of cable tv and online media that his withdrawal received more than a moment 's notice			2
so what went wrong for a candidate who entered the race with a biography and a bank account that seemed to presume a major impact on the primary campaign ? the conventional wisdom is that @entity2 was unnecessarily confrontational toward conservatives early in his campaign , the @entity8 who did n't seem to want to be a @entity8			1
for a candidate with such strong conservative credentials on almost every issue , the strategy did n't make sense			0
but that combative approach , combined with his time in the @entity54 administration , allowed him to be typecast by a lot of @entity8 voters from the outset and he never recovered			0
the other , bigger problem he faced was his lack of presence in the candidate debates			0
the debates this year , for better or worse , became the stage on which the contenders defined themselves for the voters in the early primary states			0
they provided campaign - changing moments for @entity10 , @entity71 , @entity72 and others			0
but @entity2 just faded into the background and was never able to use them as a platform from which he could draw attention to his candidacy			1
exacerbating his irrelevance was @entity2 's decision to skip the @entity82 caucuses , condemning him to be overlooked in most daily campaign coverage			1
@entity84 made the same decision 12 years earlier and used the time to build a @entity25 campaign that catapulted him to victory in that state 's primary			1
but @entity84 's biography as a @entity92 drew public attention in a way that @entity2 's time as ambassador to @entity97 could never duplicate			1
worse , @entity2 never developed a policy proposal that created a rationale for an insurgent candidacy the way @entity84 's embrace of campaign finance reform did for him that year			1
it 's not that @entity2 made any major errors in his campaign			2
he was perfectly presentable and mostly polite , the perfect lodger and the perfect guest			0
for most of the campaign , though , @entity2 was simply the man who was n't there			2
join @entity111 on @entity112 and follow updates on @entity114 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity117			0

@entity2 drops out of @entity8 race after weak *performance* in @entity25
@entity117 : @entity2 did not self - destruct , but his candidacy never caught on
@entity124 says @entity2 did n't become much of a presence in the @entity8 debates
@entity2 's decision to skip the @entity82 caucuses *helped* *lessen* media 's *interest* in him , he says
