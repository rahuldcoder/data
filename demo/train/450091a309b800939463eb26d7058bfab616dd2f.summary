-- discrimination against women and girls takes a staggering toll around the world , says author @entity6			1
it leads to as many as 100 million fewer females than males in the world			1
ending the oppression of women is the great moral challenge of the @entity14 , a cause she compares to fighting slavery in the 19th century and totalitarianism in the @entity18			2
@entity6 , a former reporter for the @entity20 who is now an investment banker , and her husband , @entity20 columnist @entity21 , wrote " @entity22 , " a book focusing on the role of women in the world			1
she spoke about their findings at the @entity30 conference in @entity31 in july and in an interview with @entity0			0
watch an interview with @entity6 during their time as correspondents in @entity37 , @entity6 and @entity21 learned of the phenomenon of an estimated 30 million " missing " baby girls in the nation			1
@entity6 says part of the gap could be attributed to infanticide by families who were determined to have a male child under @entity37 's one - child policy and in part to the development of the sonogram			2
that medical device can be used to determine the gender of a child before birth , prompting some parents to obtain abortions			0
" one peasant in the southern part of @entity37 once told us , ' the sonogram 's great , we do n't need to have baby girls any more			2
' " @entity30 : radical women embrace tradition the problem is not limited to @entity37 ; @entity6 says there are between 60 million and 100 million missing females in the world , even though women outnumber men in some more developed nations			1
the solutions , she says , are education and economic opportunity			1
overpopulation is one of the larger contributors to poverty , @entity6 said			2
" when you educate a girl , she has significantly fewer kids			2
" girls who go to school get married later in life and educate their children " in a more enlightened way			1
" @entity6 says her work is not just about helping reveal the plight of women and girls in many countries , it 's also about helping provide the groundwork for a movement to solve the problem			1
in the western world , where many people have all their material needs satisfied , it 's an obligation to reach out and help others , she says			1
@entity30 : @entity100 on embracing your inner girl @entity6 told the story of an @entity105 aid worker in @entity106 who had seen great suffering but never broke down			1
on a vacation back in the @entity105 , she visited her grandmother and noticed a bird feeder in the backyard			0
" she was in her grandmother 's backyard and she basically broke down			0
and she realized that not only was she able to feed and clothe and house herself but also see that people in her country were able to feed wild birds so that they do n't go hungry in the winter			0
she knew that with that luck and fortune also comes great responsibility			0
" here are excerpts from " @entity22 : turning oppression into @entity122 " by @entity21 and @entity6 : " so let us be clear about this up front : we hope to recruit you to join an incipient movement to emancipate women and fight global poverty by unlocking women 's power as economic catalysts			1
that is the process under way -- not a drama of victimization but of empowerment , the kind that transforms bubbly teenage girls from brothel slaves into successful businesswomen			0
this is a story of transformation			0
it is change that is already taking place , and change that can accelerate if you 'll just open your heart and join in			0
... " the tide of history is turning women from beasts of burden and sexual playthings into full - fledged human beings			0
the economic advantages of empowering women are so vast as to persuade nations to move in that direction			2
" before long , we will consider sex slavery , honor killings and acid attacks as unfathomable as foot - binding			0
the question is how long that transformation will take and how many girls will be kidnapped into brothels before it is complete -- and whether each of us will be part of that historical movement , or a bystander			0

@entity6 : tens of millions of girls die young or are n't born *due* to discrimination
educating girls and giving them economic opportunity could transform the world , she says
girls who are educated have fewer children and educate them better , she says
@entity6 : those who have their material needs satisfied should aid women around the world
