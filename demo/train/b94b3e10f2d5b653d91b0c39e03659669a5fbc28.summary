-- as a teenager , it 's easy to feel lost , to get swallowed up into the mob mentality and lose your voice			0
we 've all been victim to that ; anyone who says they have n't is either lying or under the age of 13 years			0
and so when a teenage girl undertakes such an incredible task of courage , one adults cower in fear of doing , the event takes on utmost significance			0
this is exactly what @entity20 , a huge inspiration to me and so many other girls , did			1
@entity20 stood up for herself , for her education and for her fundamental rights when confronted by a fearsome terrorist group			1
@entity20 has created a chain reaction all around the world , bringing change , light and hope to girls across all continents			1
being teenage girls in the @entity37 , so many times , we forget the opportunities we have been given			0
we roll our eyes and joke about dropping out of school , a right we take for granted in this country			0
i do n't know if i speak for all girls when i say this , but i know for me that after hearing about @entity20 's fight for education , i can not take mine so lightly any longer			1
i plan to continue my education so that i can fight for those who can not			0
@entity20 has inspired me to study politics , gender studies , social justice and peace so that i am equipped with the tools i need to help others , the tools so many girls are not given			1
@entity20 wins @entity59 but @entity20 has inspired more than just my own education ; she has inspired my entire outlook and goals			1
after i first learned of @entity20 , i could n't stop thinking about her			2
yes , i was more serious about my education and understood its importance now , but i wanted to become an activist and do something			0
i became co-president of my school 's club @entity68 , a group that sponsors the education of 66 girls in @entity73 and lobbies @entity74 annually to increase foreign aid for education			2
i also became involved with the @entity77 as the @entity79 @entity37 youth outreach coordinator so i could speak to more girls about issues like education			2
i have heard some people say that @entity20 is a mere poster child for @entity85 ideals of education , but that could not be further from the truth ; @entity20 is the hero who created the domino effect of change , bringing attention and empowering girls and boys alike to act on this issue			1
@entity20 : accolades , applause and a grim milestone it may sound corny , but i assure you that it is true : i believe that @entity20 has changed the course of my life , and i only hope that through activism around the world , other girls will have their lives changed as well			1
