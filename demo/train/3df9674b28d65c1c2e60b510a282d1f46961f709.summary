-- creating a viral ad is n't as easy as grilling spicy chicken , but restaurant chain @entity3 seems to have found the recipe for success			1
the @entity7 group , which has hundreds of branches in some 30 countries , hit the headlines again in late november with an advert portraying @entity13 's notorious president @entity12 cavorting with five fellow dictators			1
the " @entity16 " ad uses look - alike actors to show @entity12 reminiscing merrier times with former iron - fist rulers that are now deceased , including @entity21 's @entity20 , @entity23 's @entity22 and @entity25 's @entity24			1
to the nostalgic sounds of " @entity37 " by @entity38 , @entity12 remembers enjoying a water - fight with @entity20 -- in which the @entity21 former leader holds a trademark golden machine gun -- as well as re-enacting with @entity24 the famous romantic scene of @entity32 and @entity33 's from " @entity34 " on the back of an army vehicle			1
the amusing advert captured the imagination of millions , says @entity41 , managing director of @entity3 's			1
" it was bigger than we ever anticipated , " he says			2
" the whole thing of dictators over the year of 2011 was a global concept so it went really big -- bigger than any other ad in @entity7 has ever done virally			2
" the advert might got a huge reaction but the response in @entity13 was n't so funny -- the restaurant chain had to pull the ad after staff in the country were threatened by @entity12 loyalists			1
@entity13 open for business , says finance minister @entity58 's , famous for its piri - piri chicken , has a long history of testing boundaries with its advertising campaigns , which are often inspired by recent news events			1
its radical approach has become integral to the development of the brand , says @entity41			0
" chicken is a commodity and we sex chicken up by talking about the brand intrinsics and we have always been about having an advertising strategy that is cutting edge			2
we like to say what people are generally thinking , " says @entity41			0
" we like to pick things that are -- people use the word controversy -- i do n't say controversy , i 'd say things that generate healthy debate , " he adds			0
other adverts by the brand that created a stir include its campaign for the @entity7 - held football @entity92 in 2010 -- the company 's entire promotional activity for the landmark event dealt in a humorous way with misconceptions that foreigners might have of @entity7 , such as overseas visitors believing that " all @entity7 men have more than one wife " or that " all @entity7 women walk around bare - breasted all the time			0
" @entity104 bread a hit for @entity108 bakers " we were having an influx of foreigners visiting @entity7 and we needed comment on it and we did it in a way that demonstrates the ignorance and the misconceptions that people have about our country , " says @entity109 , executive creative director at @entity58 's advertising agency			2
" it touched @entity7 because they 've traveled and they 've been asked the question , ' do you have electricity in @entity7 , are there animals roaming the streets in @entity7			0
' and we took that insight and basically made a campaign that was relevant to the @entity92 , " adds @entity126			0
@entity129 seeks chocolate fairness for farmers while the brand has not shied away from dealing with heated issues such as race and gender stereotypes in its campaigns , @entity126 says that there are still some subjects that the company will not go anywhere near in its adverts			1
" we try to stay away from religion as far as possible , only because it is so sensitive and it is not a defendable topic , " he says			0
religion may be out of bounds for @entity3 's but the recent death of @entity152 's leader @entity151 sparked an immediate branding opportunity for the company			1
" when we heard that @entity151 in @entity152 had died we generated a viral commercial that we got up in less than one hour and it was really to say , ' @entity152 , it was n't us			0
we are in to eradicating hunger rather than eradicating dictators , ' " says @entity41			0
this was n't the first time the chain was quick enough to react in order to benefit from a major news event			2
and from the looks of it , it wo n't be the last			0
@entity126 says that pushing boundaries is becoming more and more important in today 's highly - competitive advertising environment			1
" i think all brands need to go there otherwise they are getting lost , " he says .			0
