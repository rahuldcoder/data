-- people are losing their jobs left and right these days , and it 's not because of the economy			1
it 's because of what they say			2
president @entity8 relieved gen. @entity9 of his job as commander of all @entity13 and @entity14 forces in @entity15 wednesday , because of negative remarks the general and his aides made about several officials in the @entity8 administration that were published in a @entity22 magazine article			1
the comments made were pretty clear that the general did not agree with many of the policies and decisions made about the war in @entity15			1
@entity9 is n't the first @entity13 general to be sacked by a commander - in - chief			1
@entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 are among those who have done the same during wartime			0
in a statement , @entity8 gave his reasons for the decision : " the conduct represented in the recently published article does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general			2
it undermines the civilian control of the military that is at the core of our democratic system			0
and it erodes the trust that 's necessary for our team to work together to achieve our objectives in @entity15			2
" while not everyone is going to be the subject of @entity22 feature , more and more people are airing their grievances bosses to the public via @entity60 , @entity61 and texting ... and getting in trouble for them			0
for every story you see in the newspaper about this issue , i bet there are many more that are n't reported			2
just this week , a friend told me she might have to let an employee go based on a @entity60 post			0
so can you disagree with your boss without losing your job ? yes , but it 's how you do it that can make or break your employment			1
most importantly , you should do is address the issue directly with your boss in a respectful manner			2
@entity84 , coauthor of " @entity85 , " gives some tips on how to do this			0
sometimes we wait to bring up concerns until we 're irritated			0
this is ineffective because at that point our goal is no longer to be constructive , it 's to punish			2
before opening your mouth , ask yourself , " what do i really want ? " 2			0
begin by clarifying your respect and your intent			1
help your boss understand that your intent is to provide a different viewpoint you feel will help achieve your mutual goal			1
once you 've created safety , you start describing your concerns facts first			1
do n't lead with your judgments or conclusions			1
start by describing in non-judgmental and objective terms the behaviors that are creating problems			0
as you lay out the facts , monitor safety			1
if your boss becomes defensive , pause for a moment and check in			0
reassure them of your positive intentions and allow them to express any concerns they have			0
finally , having shared your concerns , encourage your boss to share their perspective			0
the result of your openness will be a greater openness on your boss 's part as well			1
