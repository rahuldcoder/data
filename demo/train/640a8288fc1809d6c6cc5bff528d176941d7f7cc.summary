@entity1 , @entity0 -- in 1981 , dr @entity3 was preparing to leave @entity4 for a clinical attachment in @entity0 when her father had a heart attack			2
he fell in the street , and was taken to a public hospital , where dr @entity11 kept vigil at his bedside until he regained his strength			2
a doctor at a hospital in @entity17 where health indicators have showed no significant improvement in seven years			1
during his stay in the hospital , she was appalled at the low level of healthcare available to him			2
there was no medicine , " she told @entity2			2
as a doctor , @entity11 was able to watch over her father 's progress			2
her professional opinion on his recovery was striking			2
" my father survived that heart attack for two reasons , " she said			2
" one , because of @entity40 's will , and two , because he had a strong will			2
it was nothing to do with the health service			1
" the following year , @entity11 came to @entity0 to do a clinical attachment			0
she found herself deeply affected by the stark contrast between the healthcare available in @entity49 , on the publicly funded @entity50 , and the healthcare available at home in @entity4			0
she found herself slipping into depression			0
" i could n't talk to the patients ; i could n't talk to the doctors			1
i just could n't cope with it , " she revealed to @entity2			1
" i could n't understand why every time i saw a monitor next to a patient i was so upset			1
" it dawned on her that the gulf in care was troubling her			0
" i kept thinking why on earth my dad did n't have that			1
the only reason was that he happened to be born in @entity4 and these people had the luck to be born [ in @entity0 ]			0
" @entity11 is now a senior health & @entity72 policy advisor at third - world charity @entity73			1
her first - hand experience of the divide between the healthcare available in richer countries , and that on offer in poorer ones , has given her the impetus to try and narrow the gap			1
while @entity86 countries are pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge , discovering the potential of nanotechnology and other high - tech solutions to the developed world 's diseases , like diabetes , cancer and obesity , poor countries are struggling to combat health problems such as @entity72 , malaria and @entity99			1
lack of infrastructure and it 's not as simple as shipping medicines and supplies in bulk quantities			1
@entity73 's " paying for people " report , published in february this year , said that poor countries are suffering because they lack the infrastructure of a health service			1
the @entity114 's 2006 " @entity113 " also indicates that 4.25 million doctors , nurses and health workers are needed across 57 countries			1
@entity116 , for example , has 600,000 health workers : one million more are required			1
without these key workers , it is questionable whether healthcare in poor countries can be improved			1
@entity121 , a spokesperson for @entity73 , told @entity2 , " there is money coming in for drugs now , but there 's no commitment to long - term aid			1
" governments are unable to give healthcare workers with job security and doctors and nurses , where they do exist , are largely poorly paid : so people choose other careers			1
" they 're either becoming taxi drivers , or working for private businesses , " @entity121 says			0
this double brain - drain ( one internal , one external as those who do train are tempted away by higher salaries and brighter futures in developed countries ) means that even if drugs make it to poorer areas , there can be no one to administer them			1
" drugs are sitting in cupboards , " @entity121 told @entity2			0
" or they 're available in cities but people in rural areas do n't have the bus fares to get to them			1
" vulnerable to disease dr @entity11 backs this up			0
she told @entity2 , " there is no public investment in health systems so people have to pay for it			1
if you 're poor you ca n't buy your healthcare and if you 're a woman who happens to be poor you might as well forget it			1
" and in countries where no healthcare system exists , people are extremely vulnerable to diseases , which can spread rampantly and unchecked through communities			1
dr @entity11 paints a worrying picture			0
" particularly in @entity116 , they 're not equipped to face anything -- not @entity72 , let alone avian flu			1
if something like avian flu hit @entity116 with no health system , no health workers and no money , it would spread			1
we ca n't contain it in @entity116			1
the world would wake up and realize that , but in the meantime , it would have wiped out goodness knows how many millions of people			0
" it 's not just in @entity116			0
@entity72 is a known crisis there , but it is anticipated that more people will be infected in @entity17 than anywhere else , as the disease spreads quickly through its billion - strong population			0
increasingly , countries like these are having to deal with a boom in incommunicable diseases , like diabetes and cancer			1
chronic diseases like diabetes have the additional problem that they require long - term care , and therefore long - term funding			0
dr @entity11 explained the difficulties of that situation			0
" you buy the pills today , but maybe tomorrow you do n't have enough money so you 're never cured and develop complications			1
" what lies ahead ? dr @entity11 sees three possible outcomes for health in poor countries			1
the first , as she explained , is bleak			0
she told @entity2 , " if things continue as they are , with rising infection , increasing resistance to drugs , @entity72 and malaria run unchecked , chronic and non-communicable diseases are ignored and no money is spent on a health system , then the gap will just increase and the situation will get worse and worse			2
" dr @entity11 is hopeful , however , that the situation will improve somewhat			0
she explained a second scenario , the one she feels is most likely to happen			0
" if the international community invests a little bit , things will be slightly better , " she told @entity2			0
" more people with @entity72 will get treatment , as will people with @entity99 and malaria			0
but non-communicable chronic diseases [ like diabetes ] will be ignored			0
" but large - scale epidemics like avian flu or @entity246 would still remain a huge threat in this scenario , as would diseases like cancer			1
" who 's going to pay for medicine for cancer , which is increasing like anything in developing countries ? " asks dr @entity11			2
" hope for the future but there is a third scenario , which holds out more hope for people in developing countries			2
dr @entity11 says , " if public pressure is high , southern governments , donors and the international community will decide that health is really a priority			2
we 'll put our money where our mouth is and we 'll fulfil the commitments that we 've made before			0
" she says that in the first instance , @entity273 countries need to be encouraged to divert 16 percent of their budget to health			1
( currently , nearly a third allocate less than five percent			0
) " then they will realize that this is not enough , so they 'll put in more , " she continues			0
if this money were to be added to the $ 50 billion promised by @entity283 , the @entity283 leading industrialized nations , in @entity285 in 2005 , it would have a huge impact on health and education , particularly in @entity116			2
and education is the key , dr @entity11 believes			0
she explained , " you ca n't separate health and education because unless you educate doctors and nurses , and midwives and pharmacists , you ca n't run a health service			1
" working together it 's also important for donors and governments to work together to provide a cohesive service , she says			0
" they really need to start coordinating their work so it 's not a series of vertical programs that do n't relate to each other and waste resources			2
" @entity73 's @entity121 agrees			1
she told @entity2 , " over the last 100 years , countries like @entity311 , @entity49 and @entity312 have developed by giving their people free education and healthcare			2
it 's a major way to bring people out of poverty			0
" @entity319 cites the example of education , where the number of children not in school worldwide has fallen from around 120 million to around 80 million			1
" the key is getting governments to commit to it as a part of their aid package , and monitoring the aid package so that the money is tracked to ensure that it gets to where it 's intended , " she said			0
" it 's working for education , and they think it 'll work for healthcare too , but it needs committed investment			0
" and in the meantime , people like @entity3 will continue their work to pressure governments to encourage positive change			2
she says , " that 's my motivation to do this work			0
it 's not for me ; it 's a life thing			0
my dream in life is for everybody in @entity116 to have access to a publicly financed , publicly run healthcare service with strong regulation , quality , care and equity			0
" e-mail to a friend			0

@entity73 : lack of infrastructure is the greatest *danger* to health in poor countries
@entity114 : 4.25 million more doctors and nurses needed worldwide
poor countries wo n't cope with @entity246 , avian flu
positive policy changes have seen number of children not in school fall by a third
