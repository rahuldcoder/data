-- call it the @entity2 of social sharing			2
as if it was n't enough for @entity5 to limit our bursts of inspiration to 140 written characters , it has now rolled out @entity10 , a video - sharing app that limits your videos to just six seconds			1
what can you do with six seconds of smartphone video ( which , for now , is available only on @entity16 , causing an aggravated @entity18 nation to again wail and wait ) ? not re-enact " @entity19 " using action figures			2
that would take 2,270 vine posts , give or take			2
nor can you document a successful rodeo bull ride ; those require at least eight seconds			2
as the tech press largely fawns over the new tool 's potential , we 're taking a look at some of the ways the tool might affect your @entity5 feed and the web as a whole			1
and it seems only appropriate that we analyze @entity10 's six - second bursts in six points			1
here 's what @entity10 could do : 1			1
spur creativity if , as the @entity45 wrote , brevity is the soul of wit , the six - second time limit could in fact inspire creativity			1
that 's the logic behind @entity5 itself , really			1
once derided by critics as an example of society 's increasingly gnat - like attention span , the site 's 140 - character limit has in many cases inspired users to be as witty , insightful or informative as they can be in as few words as possible			2
@entity5 is sometimes called a " microblogging " site			1
considering some of the long and winding blog posts we 've read over the years , there 's some value in spurring users to make their point quickly			2
maybe @entity10 will do the same for web video			1
" my guess , given the enthusiasm for @entity5 so far , is that people are going to do really cool things , " @entity68 , co-director of the @entity69 at @entity70 , told @entity71 , a @entity0 content partner			1
" one of the things we know about creativity is that constraints are essential for getting people to do creative stuff			2
if you come up with the right constraints , that 's a benefit , not a drawback			2
" and here 's an example : ( of course , if you desperately need a 10 - minute loop of sniveling @entity91 from " @entity92 " getting slapped to a @entity94 soundtrack , we 've still got @entity95			0
spam up your feed a vine can be a lovely thing			2
think @entity99 or the @entity100			0
but it can also be a noxious weed			0
in the first 24 hours , the primary theme of most of the @entity10 videos we 've seen has been " hey , i 'm making a @entity10 video ! " we 're not immune from this ourselves			1
that will probably change , in many cases , as creative folks fine - tune their craft			0
but let 's be honest : among @entity5 's millions of users are a lot of people who will probably be sharing the banal and the stupid			1
and , if web history holds true , clips of themselves naked			0
hopefully , you 've crafted your " follow " list to keep most of these people off your screen			0
otherwise , you could find yourself clicking on a lot of videos of people 's food			2
which , as we all know , is what @entity128 is for			0
turn @entity5 into @entity131 's video alternative it surprisingly took a few months after @entity131 bought the aforementioned @entity128 , an app that lets users slap groovy - looking filters onto their photos , for it to cause a falling - out with @entity5			1
@entity131 pulled @entity5 's ability to show @entity128 images in its feed			1
that 's reserved for fb now			0
you can still post them to @entity5 , of course , but followers see only a link that takes them to @entity128 's website			1
fair enough , we suppose			0
why let a competitor reap the benefits of an app you just shelled out a reported $ 1 billion to buy ? so , if that makes @entity131 the go - to platform for social photos , maybe @entity10 makes @entity5 the default place for fun mini-videos			1
as the platform strives to turn a profit , the @entity10 clips may give users a new reason to linger			1
invite more " oops " moments delete all you want			0
once you tweet something , it 's out there forever			0
put videocameras in the hands of millions , give them a platform to share the results with the rest of those millions , and bad decisions are sure to ensue			0
often after a few cocktails , or if you 're a celebrity			0
given a new tool with which to share , or overshare , we all can expect more @entity5 missteps			1
many of us ca n't wait			0
continue the rebirth of " @entity186 " ok , this one is already under way			0
years after the @entity189 gave us @entity191 , folks have rediscovered the joy of watching something quick and silly happen over and over again			0
@entity10 builds on this idea			1
your six seconds ( or fewer ) of video loops for as long as the viewer lets it run			2
this can be disconcerting and annoying			0
but as folks get creative , it could also be clever			0
the first person to re-enact " @entity204 " has our undying devotion			0
( @entity208 discovery : that @entity95 classic is exactly six seconds long )			0
a @entity10 is n't actually a @entity186 ( @entity210 is the full name )			1
but it can take advantage of the same instincts that have made gifs an enduring web feature			0
press the competition @entity10 is n't the only mobile app jockeying to be the " @entity128			1
" @entity219 , tout , @entity220 and even the ill - fated color all wanted to become the front - runner in this emerging social field			0
@entity5 may have shut down that argument when it acquired @entity10 for an undisclosed amount			1
sure , the mobile space has its share of stories in which the bantamweight manages to dance around a heavy hitter			0
remember when @entity231 was supposed to crush @entity232 ? but @entity10 will be sitting right there in front of @entity5 's more than 140 million users			1
the others will need to innovate or die			0
have you seen any @entity10 videos you really liked , or made some of your own ? let us know in the comments .			1

with @entity10 , @entity5 adds video to its short bursts of text
the new app could spur more creativity among @entity5 users
it also might lead to lots of *boring* little videos in your feed
the *launch* may crown @entity10 as the leader in the " @entity259 " race
