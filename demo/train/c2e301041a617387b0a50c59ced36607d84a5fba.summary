-- four years ago , @entity2 presidential candidate @entity1 had raised $ 8.3 million by the end of the third quarter of 2007			1
one - third of that came in small , unitemized contributions of under $ 200 each -- the proverbial " small donor " giving that is the mark of a grass - roots based campaign			2
in the 2012 cycle , he has raised $ 15.4 million through september 30 , of which 41 % has come in amounts under $ 200			2
four years ago , according to the @entity14 ( my source for all these numbers ) , by september 30 @entity1 had a little more than 7,000 itemized individual donors -- the people who give between $ 201 and the top individual limit , which was then $ 2,300 ( and is now $ 2,500 )			1
this time around , he had more than 12,000 itemized individual donors at the end of september			0
( by comparison , @entity23 only had 19,700 itemized individual donors this past september 30 , compared to 29,700 four years ago			0
) clearly -- only six days before voters caucus in @entity27 -- @entity1 is doing something more right in 2012 than he did in 2008			1
that includes keeping his massive online base engaged after 2008 with various campaigns , including his son @entity32 's successful bid for the @entity34			1
it also includes spending lots of money earlier this summer in @entity27 and @entity38 on tv ads that were far more professionally produced than anything he ran four years ago			0
he has spent oodles more hitting his @entity2 rivals hard now that the first actual caucuses and primaries are just days away			0
he also has developed a well - organized campaign organization on the ground , something he lacked four years ago			0
says @entity2 online strategist @entity50 , who worked on @entity1 's 2008 e-campaign , " it 's wonderful to see the campaign building early state infrastructure , something 2008 was lacking , focused on winning			1
" it also does n't hurt that on some issues -- like the power of the @entity59 , the bailout of the banks and @entity63 's expensive wars overseas -- the questions @entity1 has been asking have gained in salience since 2008			1
that 's true even if you do n't agree with his answers on those issues			0
it probably has also helped that for almost all of the last year , the mainstream media has n't bothered to take @entity1 very seriously			1
no less an authority than @entity72 has pointed out , several times , the strange bias in the media against giving @entity1 his due , or asking hard questions of his many hyper - libertarian positions			1
thus he 's mostly flown under the radar , until now			0
now , in this topsy - turvy presidential primary , where no one candidate seems capable of building and holding a dominating lead , @entity27 polls show that @entity1 suddenly seems on the verge of a breakthrough			1
lots of observers think he may well win the caucuses by a plurality ( especially if it snows and supporters of other candidates stay home )			0
no less a sage than @entity95 of the @entity97 blog at the @entity98 says an @entity27 win could give @entity1 a shot at winning @entity38			2
what that may mean for the larger politics of 2012 is beyond the scope of this column			0
but there 's a paradox buried inside @entity1 's rise in the @entity2 field , a time bomb ticking away			2
call it the curse of the " @entity113			0
" the more @entity1 rises , the more he needs to temper his rhetoric and fine - tune his message ( especially given the kind of baggage he carries )			1
and the more he needs a fine - tuned message , the more he has to control his fractious fans			1
but people who organize themselves online today are notoriously hard to control			0
recall how in 2007 , the " @entity131 " were everywhere : running up the numbers on every online poll they could find , generating one - day fundraising records in a desperate bid for national attention ( they coined the word " money - bomb " ) , and creating massive amounts of voter - generated media on his behalf			1
they made everything from viral videos to a @entity1 blimp			2
it was , as @entity137 , his online director from that campaign , put it to me , " a very organic , grass - roots driven campaign			2
" and many of the tactics those grass - roots supporters dreamed up , like that blimp , which cost $ 600,000 , did n't do much to actually help @entity1 win votes on the ground in the all - important early states			1
this time , @entity148 observes , " there does n't seem to be the same amount of excitement , but that could be because there 's more of a typical campaigning structure around all activities this time around because of the lessons learned , the training that was done between the campaigns and probably various other reasons			0
" my guess is that those other reasons include the sense that , given the divided field , @entity1 could somehow go all the way and win the @entity2 nomination			2
and if you thought your favorite long - shot candidate was on the verge of a breakthrough , you 'd probably discipline yourself , too			2
but things are about to get a bit crazy			0
@entity1 's late surge and possible win next week in @entity27 are going to generate a huge burst of national media attention and plenty of hard - edged questions about his past and views			1
and the @entity181 base does n't handle criticism very well			0
the other day , for example , my @entity184 colleague @entity183 reported on a growing battle breaking out on the massive social news filtering site @entity187 between @entity1 supporters and critics tired of their efforts to " spam " @entity192 with slanted news favoring @entity1			1
vocal @entity1 supporters outnumber their critics on the site , but their language and tactics are often arrogant and ugly			2
@entity200 can power a campaign , but self - righteousness can also cripple it			0
if the internet hyper - empowers small groups of people , enabling them to punch above their weight , it also hyper - exposes them			0
in the coming days , as @entity1 's star rises , his online base is going to be tested as much as he is			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			0

@entity1 is trying to engage his massive online base with various campaigns
clearly the candidate is doing something more right in 2012 than he did in 2008
the more @entity1 rises , the more he needs to temper his rhetoric and fine - tune his message
