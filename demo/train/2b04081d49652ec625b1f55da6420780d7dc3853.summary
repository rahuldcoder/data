-- as everyone but the citizens of @entity4 knows , @entity1 is @entity5			1
but lately , he 's been @entity6			0
and this month , he 's also @entity7 and @entity8			0
will the real @entity1 please stand up ? this look at @entity1 's past , present and future has been brought about by @entity12 , the @entity13 writer and playwright behind the award - winning " @entity15			1
" @entity12 has masterminded a new direction for the character and returns to the 70 - year - old " @entity1 " comic book series with its 700th issue wednesday			1
" i started to do a bunch of research , and i realized that every story had been told , " @entity12 said			2
he decided upon a psychological deconstruction of the character that would run over many issues and over two years , beginning with the story arc " @entity27 " in 2006			1
in order to bring @entity12 's master plan to fruition , to " set up a whole new status quo " for @entity1 , as he puts it , @entity5 would have to be driven to the brink of insanity and ultimately killed , as he was in the mega-crossover story " @entity34			1
" for the past year , @entity5 's onetime ward @entity36 has been @entity1 , and his son @entity37 has taken over for @entity38 , in a @entity1 series lighter in tone than what we 've been used to in the past few decades			1
this has all led up to " @entity1 : the @entity44 , " currently in the middle of its six - issue run , in which @entity5 -- or his consciousness at least -- travels through time on his way back to the present day			1
all of these plot threads culminate in the 700th issue , which tells stories of the @entity1 of the past ( @entity5 ) , present ( @entity36 ) and future ( @entity37 ) , interpreted by three different artists			1
" i wanted to sum up all of the things we love about @entity1 over the years and kind of see that moment where the @entity5 becomes the @entity58 , " @entity12 explained			1
" [ all of the stories ] connect in an interesting way			0
we also have a section looking at all the different future @entity63			0
it 's an attempt to do every version of @entity1			2
" indeed , @entity12 is hard - pressed to choose a favorite interpretation of @entity1			1
he has a great appreciation for all of them , from the campy 1960s tv series to @entity71 's gritty 1980s graphic novel " @entity72 " to the current movies directed by @entity74			0
" @entity1 has been around 70 years			2
he 's been a comedy figure			0
he was a sci - fi superhero in the ' 50s			0
" if he had to pick one , @entity12 would go with the version of @entity1 as the world 's greatest detective , as seen in the 1970s stories written by the legendary @entity83			1
@entity83 is returning for a special one - shot story himself this month			2
" we like to revisit the people that made the character great , " said @entity85 , co-publisher of @entity86 ( owned by @entity87 , which is also the parent company of @entity0 )			0
" we pull him out of retirement every once in a while for @entity1			2
it 's not an anniversary party without him			0
" if that 's not enough , @entity86 has two more bat - related mini-series starting this month			1
one is " @entity98 , " based on the fan favorite animated series with @entity8 as another future version of @entity1			1
this series officially brings the character into @entity105 canon			0
" the fans have been looking for this for a while , " @entity85 said			0
" this looked like the perfect opportunity to reintroduce him			0
" meanwhile , the secret past of another once " deceased " character , @entity113 , the second @entity38 , is explored in " @entity114 : lost days			1
" is @entity113 more a hero or villain ? @entity12 said , " he 's an antihero , which is really good , and people like that			2
he 's not an evil villain ; he 's just a fallen superhero			0
" as for @entity12 's plans , he 's sticking around the @entity123 for a few more years			2
" i kind of figured [ the story ] would end , but it kept developing strands that were interesting			0
" after that , he 's pondering changing the status quo of a certain @entity129 princess : " i 've done my @entity15 story , and i 've done my @entity1			2
... it would be great to do one for @entity132			0
