@entity0 -- @entity2 leader @entity2 holds a slim four - point edge over his @entity5 challenger @entity4 in a new @entity1 / @entity6 of one of the most closely watched @entity9 races of 2014			1
@entity11 's 4 - point advantage , 50 % -46 % , falls within the survey 's 4 - point sampling error , furthering emphasizing how close this @entity15 contest remains 62 days before @entity16			2
the outcome of this election may help decide control of the @entity9 , influence president @entity20 's final two years in office and determine the political fate of @entity15 's longest - serving senator			1
data from the poll offers both hope and challenges for each candidate over the next two months , as outside groups and the individual candidates continue to pour millions of dollars into this race to try to influence @entity32 on whom to support in november			0
that sliver of persuadable voters might be as small as 19 % , which is the number of people who said they " might change their mind			0
" in contrast , 77 % of those surveyed said they " made up their mind " about whom they will back in november			0
what might be a troubling data point for @entity4 is the number of @entity5 -- 16 % -- who said they are supporting or leaning towards supporting @entity11			1
" that 16 % may not sound like much , but it 's more than double the number of crossover votes that @entity4 wins from @entity54 , " @entity1 polling director @entity50 said			2
" it 's likely that there are some @entity5 who think that their state is better off with a @entity15 running the @entity9 rather than a @entity59 who would rank at the very bottom in seniority			1
" and that is a main talking point for @entity11 on the campaign trail , a senator who speaks about how he delivers for @entity32 while maintaining conservative sensibilities			2
he also embraces his role as one of @entity20 's biggest critics , which in many ways is low - hanging fruit in a commonwealth that overwhelmingly disapproves of how the commander - in - chief is handling his job			0
@entity20 has a 64 % disapproval rating in the poll among all respondents , while only 29 % approve of his stewardship of the country			0
the president 's high disapproval rating is fueled in part by his policy on coal -- a major employer in parts of @entity15			0
in fact , @entity11 has a whopping 20 % lead over @entity4 in the east and a 28 % lead over her in the west , the two coal - producing regions in the commonwealth			1
it is no surprise that @entity4 has not embraced @entity20 , and has even chastised him publicly for his position on coal			2
" she has made it quite clear where she stands on coal , " said a @entity5 strategist who spoke freely about the race on the condition of anonymity			1
" and she has a starkly different approach to @entity15 's coal industry than president @entity20 and some national @entity5			2
" what is troubling for @entity11 is that despite being one of the most powerful republicans in the nation , he is locked in a statistical tie with @entity4 who holds a 10 - point lead over @entity11 in the @entity115 ( anchored by the cities of @entity117 and @entity118 ) , a 27 - point lead over @entity11 in the @entity121 area ( anchored by the city of @entity123 ) , and an 8 - point lead over @entity11 in the suburbs of @entity123 and @entity126			1
the poll indicates a controversy that erupted friday that forced @entity11 's campaign manager to resign has not had a major impact on this race			2
@entity132 cut ties with the campaign as speculation swirled about his involvement in an unfolding corruption scandal related to then - rep. @entity139 's 2012 bid for president			0
the bottom line for @entity11 is that he is the no. 1 target of national @entity5			1
a @entity54 strategist acknowledged as much saying that @entity5 leaders have framed this race to their donor base as an opportunity to defeat a major opponent to the @entity5 agenda			1
national @entity5 money will continue to flow into @entity15			2
digging deeper into the data , there are no real surprises in terms of which candidate is winning traditional political demographic groups : @entity11 has a 13 % lead with men and is seen more favorably by voters who make $ 50,000 or more , while @entity4 holds a seven - point lead with women and does better with voters making less than $ 50,000			1
@entity5 view the @entity9 race twofold : an opportunity to defeat a @entity54 leader , a major symbolic victory that last occurred in 2004 when then - senate minority leader @entity168 , a @entity169 @entity59 , was defeated by former rep. @entity170 ; and more important for @entity5 , the @entity15 race is a key part of the political beachhead needed to protect their vulnerable @entity9 majority in november			1
for republicans to take back control of the @entity9 floor and the committees that produce legislation and provide oversight of the @entity20 administration , the party needs a net gain of six seats -- a very doable task given the math and electoral map two months before @entity16 , even though @entity5 currently hold a 55 - 45 seat advantage in the chamber			1
to start , @entity5 need to defend 21 seats in november , while the @entity54 only needs to protect 15			0
take a closer look at the 36 @entity9 seats on the ballot this year and the news is even more disturbing for @entity5			1
at least three seats currently held by @entity5 -- @entity195 , @entity169 and @entity196 -- are expected to be won by @entity54 on november 4 , according to the most recent @entity1 analysis of the 2014 midterm election			0
and of the six seats that @entity1 designated as " @entity199 , " five are held by @entity5 incumbents representing @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205			0
at this time , @entity15 is the only @entity54 - held seat that @entity1 has placed in the " @entity199 " column			0
so , while there are many competitive @entity9 races in this election , @entity15 is viewed as the premier contest heading into november			0
the poll was conducted for @entity1 by @entity6 , which interviewed 1,037 adult @entity213 , including 671 likely voters , by telephone between august 28 and september 1			0
the sampling error for results for likely voters is + / -4 percentage points			0
after 30 years in @entity9 , @entity11 runs as ' candidate of change '			1

@entity9 race could determine balance of power in the @entity9
it could also decide whether @entity2 will be @entity9 majority leader
@entity11 is running as an agent of change after 30 years in the @entity9
opponent @entity4 is a rising star in the @entity5
