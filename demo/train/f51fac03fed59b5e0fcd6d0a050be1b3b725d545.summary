-- the @entity2 season is already up and running and over the weekend the @entity3 returned to action , while @entity6 clubs continue to prepare for the start of @entity8 on 23 august			2
so who were the weekend 's winners and losers ? winners @entity12 no @entity13 ? no problem for @entity12			1
in a tight @entity3 opener against @entity16 , the attacking talents who still remain at @entity19 proved last season 's runners - up still have bite , despite the departure of @entity26 football 's least favorite @entity24			1
big things are expected of livewire @entity28 and the @entity31 starlet continued the electrifying form he displayed at the end of last season			0
latching onto a perfect @entity35 through ball in the first half , he produced a calm finish to open the scoring			0
but after @entity16 equalized in the second half , it was @entity13 's former strike partner @entity42 who made the decisive contribution			1
one half of the " @entity48 " duo that was so prolific last term , @entity42 steered home @entity28 's 79th - minute header to ensure @entity52 ' team opened with a 2 - 1 win			1
playing in just his 50th match for @entity12 , @entity42 scored his 36th goal			1
if @entity42 and @entity28 keep firing , memories of @entity13 will fade fast			2
" vanishing spray " consisting of 80 % water and 17 % butane gas , it 's an unlikely football icon			1
but on its @entity3 debut , " vanishing spray " was cheered to the rafters by supporters the length and breadth of @entity31			1
used to great success at the @entity70 , having long been a staple of @entity72 , the foamy substance is sprayed by referees to position players at set pieces			0
@entity26 football is a late adopter of the pocket - sized innovation , but the country 's fans whooped and hollered like cavemen playing with a lighter every time a referee grabbed the canister from his waistband			2
not everyone is convinced , though			0
@entity88 's @entity87 swallowed a mouthful of the stuff after referee @entity91 suffered a nozzle malfunction			0
it might be hard for the @entity94 to stomach , but it looks like " vanishing spray " is here to stay			1
@entity97 the craze which has swept through the @entity99 has made its way into football and , even though he did n't kick a ball this weekend , @entity97 rounds up our list of winners			0
the @entity107 star became the latest footballer to brave the " ice bucket challenge , " which began in @entity110 as a way of raising money for the degenerative condition @entity113 ( @entity113 ) , also known as @entity113			0
a host of celebrities have soaked themselves in icy cold water , and @entity97 joined the likes of @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 after being nominated by former @entity122 teammate @entity121			2
sat in a tiny purple speedo , @entity97 nominated rapper @entity124 as well as @entity125 and @entity126 before being drenched by fellow @entity128 international @entity127			0
over to you , @entity129 ... losers @entity122 how misleading can six pre-season wins be ? @entity122 's 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity134 on saturday showed there will be no easy fixes for new manager @entity137			1
the @entity145 " mad genius " quickly had to rethink his 3 - 5 - 2 formation as @entity134 exposed manifest weaknesses in @entity122 's defence , while comfortably dealing with their ponderous midfield and stuttering attack			1
more worryingly saturday 's defeat highlighted the lack of investment in @entity122 's squad over the last few years , a legacy bequeathed to former manager @entity151 by his predecessor @entity152			1
the club 's owners have spared no effort in lining up myriad global sponsors --- official noodle and paint partners to name but two --- so it 's a shame more has n't been done to identify and rectify deficiencies in the playing staff			0
chief executive @entity164 has a matter of days left in the transfer window to improve @entity122 's strength in depth but his track record of success --- or arguable lack of -- in bringing in new players is increasingly coming under the spotlight			2
@entity174 have @entity174 lost their mojo ? after finishing second last season , @entity174 is without a point after two games and sunday 's 4 - 1 defeat at @entity181 illustrates @entity184 's noveau riche club might struggle without @entity185 , who joined @entity107 in the summer			1
two of those four goals came from penalties , which prompted @entity174 's new coach @entity189 to point the finger at referee @entity191 as a key factor in his side 's defeat			1
" we had two refereeing errors that sealed the match and after that there 's been no game			0
we must continue to work - we will continue to believe in these players , " @entity189 told reporters			2
there was some good news for @entity189 and @entity174 in that @entity204 international @entity203 came on as a second substitute as he returns from the serious knee injury that ruled him out of the @entity70			2
@entity207 elsewhere in @entity2 , @entity209 's @entity208 striker @entity207 could be in all sorts of trouble after the @entity214 club 's 2 - 0 defeat by champions @entity215			1
@entity216 suffered a broken nose after the game with @entity220 cameras in the @entity222 tunnel showing @entity207 waiting for the @entity224 international before the @entity209 forward headbutted the @entity215 midfielder			0
@entity2 secretary of state for sports @entity227 told @entity229 the headbutt was " scandalous " and " unacceptable " and " merited a sanction			0
" @entity215 president @entity232 went further , telling @entity233 after the game that @entity207 should be " suspended for life ... he is not a football player			0
" @entity2 's @entity240 disciplinary committee is due to examine the incident on thursday and , given the severity of the " biting " sanction handed out to @entity13 by world governing body @entity244 , it will be interesting to what the @entity2 regulator does			2
that was n't @entity207 's only impact on the match with @entity215 saying their @entity145 defender @entity250 suffered " a fracture of the second lumbar vertebra " following a knee in the back in the first half			0
" last season @entity207 was suspended for four matches after elbowing @entity215 's @entity257 at the @entity222 while playing for @entity258 .			0

without @entity13 , @entity12 beat @entity16 2 - 1
vanishing spray proves hit with fans
@entity137 suffers losing league start as @entity122 manager
@entity174 without a point after two games in @entity184
