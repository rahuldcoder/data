-- the death of @entity2 deprives @entity3 of a leading propagandist and an inspirational figure to jihadists the world over			2
his calm eloquence and fluent @entity9 turned @entity2 into a @entity11 phenomenon , and his emergence as the ideological guide of @entity14 , or @entity14 , put him at the heart of one of the most dangerous terror groups on earth			1
known as the " professor " by the group 's operatives , he also became the spiritual mentor to would - be jihadists living in anonymous suburbs half a world away			2
@entity26 arrived in @entity27 after spending much of his youth and adult life in the @entity30 , where he studied in @entity31 and was an imam at mosques in @entity34 and the @entity36 metro area			1
he even gave interviews in the aftermath of 9/11 decrying the terror attacks			1
but at some point he became disillusioned with his adopted country -- perhaps because of a series of encounters with @entity30 law enforcement over his alleged use of prostitutes			1
when he left in 2002 he took a unique understanding with him of the vulnerabilities of an open society , the sentiments of @entity30 muslims and the opportunities of social media in the 21st century			1
one such opportunity was online propaganda , best evidenced by @entity14 's glossy periodical inspire			2
the seventh edition was published this week , edited by another @entity30 jihadist in hiding in @entity27 who had been attracted to the cause by @entity2 's teachings			1
that edition promised a forthcoming essay by @entity2 titled " targeting populations of countries at @entity65			2
" it was @entity2 's favorite theme			2
last year he called on @entity30 @entity52 to rise up against their " oppression			1
" in a video released in november 2010 , @entity2 said there was no need to a fatwa to kill @entity30			1
" killing @entity73 does not require a fatwa , " he said			2
" we have reached with them a situation of ' @entity78 or you			2
' " as always , he was careful to justify and explain his words through @entity82 verses , which gave his sermons and speeches greater credibility among would - be jihadists			2
according to @entity27 officials , @entity2 had become much more radical in 2007 - 08			0
by this time he was very active on @entity88			0
his dvds were being attractively packaged and sold in the @entity90			0
his @entity11 followers ran into many thousands			0
and he was in e-mail contact with extremists in the @entity30 and the @entity94			1
two cases illustrate @entity2 's ability to attract followers online			0
the best known is the messages exchanged between him and @entity100 maj. @entity99 , who is being tried for the murder of 13 people at @entity103 in @entity104			1
in subsequent interviews , @entity2 said @entity99 had initiated e-mail correspondence with him in december 2008			1
@entity107 reported : " he was asking about killing @entity30 soldiers and officers , " says @entity2			1
" his question was , is it legitimate " under @entity113 law			0
more than a dozen e-mails followed , with @entity99 asking @entity2 about martyrdom , about when jihad is permissible ( about which @entity2 had written volumes ) , the death of innocent bystanders in attacks			1
and after the shootings , @entity2 was quick to praise them			0
in the @entity107 interview , he calls the shooting " a heroic action			0
" " the operation had a military target inside @entity30 , and there 's no dispute about that , " says @entity2 , adding that the soldiers killed " were prepared and equipped to fight and kill oppressed @entity52			1
" he also mocked @entity30 intelligence for not picking up on the e-mail traffic			1
the other case that illustrates @entity2 's reach involved a @entity138 employee , @entity137			0
in february this year a @entity94 court heard that @entity2 and @entity137 had been corresponding , via heavily encrypted software , in late 2009 and early 2010			0
in one message purported to be from @entity2 , the writer made clear where his priorities lay : " our highest priority is the @entity30			1
anything there , even on a smaller scale compared to what we may do in the @entity94 , would be our choice			0
" @entity26 clearly saw an opportunity in @entity137 's employment at the airline			1
" i immediately wanted to contact you to tell you that my advice to you is to remain in your current position , " @entity2 wrote			0
" depending on what your role is and the amount of information you can get your hands on , you might be able to provide us with critical and urgent information and you may be able to play a crucial role			0
" he also sought details on " limitations and cracks " in present airport security systems , and told @entity137 he should train as @entity138 cabin crew if possible			0
@entity26 then asked , " did any of the ( brothers ) you mentioned get training on x-ray machines or understand their limitations ? " through the @entity179 embassy attacks , the @entity175 resort attacks of 2002 and most obviously the 9/11 attacks , the @entity3 of @entity177 had become known for spectacular simultaneous attacks aimed at mass casualties			1
@entity26 recognized that attacks of such magnitude would be difficult to repeat given enhancements in security and intelligence gathering			1
he and @entity14 began to focus on smaller but highly disruptive attacks that would have a psychological and economic impact on the @entity30			1
two such examples are the attempt to blow up a @entity30 airliner on christmas day 2009 in the " underpants bomber " conspiracy ; and the printer bomb plot from 2010			1
@entity26 boasted about the @entity196 plot , saying that @entity197 , the suspect who is now on trial , succeeded " even though it did n't cause the killing of one single person			2
" " they spent more than $ 40 billion , and a mujahed like @entity204 was able to infiltrate their security apparatus even though they claim he was under surveillance , " he said in may 2010			0
similarly , in one exchange with @entity137 , he asked : " is it possible to make false reports on security risks on airplanes and airports ? reports that would cause planes to be grounded and airports closed			0
... this does n't count for much but it does cause them some nuisance and loss			0
" in the last two years @entity2 had begun to play a more active operational role for the group , driving forward its ambitions to attack the @entity30			2
" let me underscore , @entity2 is no mere messenger but someone integrally involved in lethal terrorist activities , " @entity225 counterterrorism coordinator @entity224 warned in april			0
internet communications presented as evidence during the @entity94 trial of @entity137 revealed @entity2 to be playing a key key role in handling jihadist volunteers arriving in @entity27 and the key driver behind its ambition to attack the @entity90			0
it is possible that his departure from the scene may result in the terrorist group placing more emphasis on expanding its sphere of influence in @entity27 , though @entity238 counterterrorism officials will be concerned the group may launch a revenge attack			0
as he became more prominent -- and more closely associated with the operational side of @entity3 -- @entity2 escaped at least two attempts to kill him			1
the first was at the end of 2009 , when a cruise missile struck a compound in a remote part of @entity27			0
more recently , an attack on a convoy in southern @entity27 , believed to have been carried out by drones , killed several @entity3 operatives but @entity2 again escaped injury			2
the inability of the @entity27 or @entity30 governments to capture or kill him had begun to add to his mystique			1
" i move freely in @entity27 , " he said in march 2010			0
" there is a support among my tribesmen			0
... even though they know they are in danger , they welcome me and greet me because they are righteous people			0
we may never know whether one of these " righteous people " betrayed him or whether other intelligence finally led to his death , but @entity3 has lost one of its principal flag - bearers .			2

@entity26 was at the heart of one of the most dangerous terror groups on earth
growing up and living in the @entity30 gave him a unique understanding of @entity30 society
he mocked @entity30 intelligence for not picking up his e-mail traffic with maj. @entity99
he had escaped at least two previous attempts to kill him
