and despite generally strong reviews and record early sales , the @entity2 is no exception			1
@entity6 's new phone went on sale friday in the @entity8 and six other countries , and maybe no rollout this massive ( @entity6 reported selling 4 million of the new phones over the weekend ) could be expected to be without problems			1
so far , there 's been no @entity2 equivalent to the @entity16 's " @entity15			1
" but as folks put their new gadget through its paces , some early complaints have appeared on online message boards			0
some of these may be early - run blips ( that 's how we 're going to categorize the problems that some customers had activating their phones over the weekend )			2
whether they become enduring causes of headaches remains to be seen			0
( @entity6 did not immediately respond to our request for comment			0
) but here are five of the most frequent complaints we 've heard about the @entity2 : 1			1
slow service on sprint the big news on the carrier front for the @entity2 was that @entity38 would be added as an approved mobile carrier , joining @entity42 and @entity43			1
but some @entity38 customers did n't get off to a very good start			1
many users were reporting slow data speed for the first couple of days			1
a thread on the @entity38 community forum has 23 pages of people talking about slow data speed			1
" @entity38 , we need some answer			2
are you guys doing @entity2 specific throttling ? " one person posted			2
" you will lose your customer if the customer finding their @entity2 unusable ... " this is n't the first time @entity38 's speed has come into question			1
in @entity67 's june survey of the fastest mobile networks , @entity38 trailed @entity43 and @entity42 in most regions of the country			2
a @entity38 news release said friday was the biggest sales day of a mobile device in its history , surpassing expectations			2
" as always , @entity38 is carefully monitoring the performance of the @entity79 , " @entity38 spokesman @entity76 said in a written statement to @entity0			2
" we are looking into a small number of reports of slow data speeds when using the @entity2 , however there are also reports showing that @entity38 's network is the fastest , such as the @entity86 report that came out earlier today			1
weak battery at the october 4 presentation unveiling the @entity2 , @entity89 , @entity6 vice president for product management , praised its " fantastic battery life " that would allow people to talk for eight hours before needing to charge the device again			1
but that 's not the experience everyone is reporting			0
@entity6 review site @entity98 published a review of the phone , including battery - life comparisons			2
" after three days of non-stop testing , we had a clear answer : the @entity2 is generally more power hungry than the @entity16 , and @entity6 has only made the slightest capacity improvement to the @entity2 's battery , " the review reads			1
" moreover , whereas @entity6 underpromised with the @entity16 's battery estimates , it comes closer to overpromising with the @entity2			1
" the review says that using @entity110 consistently and using the phone mainly for calls and web browsing wears the battery out at roughly the same speed as the @entity2 , while playing videos and music or using a 3g connection will drain it faster			2
siri outside the @entity8 demand for the @entity2 was clearly global			1
but one of its biggest selling - points , the built - in voice assistant @entity120 , only works fully stateside			0
while many of its built - in features work anywhere , location based actions do n't			0
so , using @entity120 to , say , find a local business or get driving directions , does n't work elsewhere			1
even queries asking for the time of day were n't working in @entity133 , according to some reports			0
compounding that problem ( for some folks both inside and outside the @entity8 ) is the fact that @entity120 has trouble understanding heavy accents			1
it currently works with @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 ( with more languages coming )			0
but non-native @entity141 speakers have reported lots of trouble			0
we can only imagine how @entity120 's doing in @entity149			2
camera problems another big selling point for the @entity2 is its 8 - megapixel camera , which is a pretty significant jump from the 5 megapixels on the @entity16 and 3 megapixels on the @entity155			1
reviews of the images the phone renders have been overwhelmingly positive , with users reporting a major difference in clarity			0
but the same " shutter speed " issues users have complained about on previous iphones appear to be back again			0
in a forum discussion on @entity6 's site , some reported that when they 'd take a photo , the camera got stuck with the shutter closed or moved really slowly			0
others said the camera was n't working at all , although it looks like they were largely able to fix that by turning the phone off and restarting			0
screen appearance at least it looks like there 's an easy answer for this one			0
some buyers are reporting a yellowish tint or spots on the screen of their phones , making the resolution fuzzier than older phones			0
this is an issue that previous iphones had as well			0
while @entity6 has never officially explained it ( presumably because it has n't impacted enough people ) , technicians have reportedly said it 's residue from the manufacturing process			0
the tint tends to fade after a couple of days .			0

the @entity2 has been massively *popular* , but there have been some complaints
some @entity38 customers have *griped* about slow data speeds
tests show that the @entity2 battery life , in some *instances* , is weaker than the @entity16 's
" @entity120 ca n't give directions or find locations outside the @entity8
