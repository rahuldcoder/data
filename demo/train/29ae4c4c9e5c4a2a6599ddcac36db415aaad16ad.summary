-- in sport , finishing fourth rarely provokes scenes of rapture , nor does it excite the keyboards of headline writers			0
but for @entity7 who finished in that position in last season 's @entity10 -- @entity14 's top soccer competition - fourth place was truly a miracle			1
the @entity14 soccer club has rarely tasted glory in its short history			2
despite having a small but vociferous fan base , the team is better know as perennial nearly - men ; forever stuck in @entity14 's second division as promotion to the big league eluded them season after season			1
yet in march last year @entity7 was looking forward with optimism to a rare season in @entity14 's top flight			1
on march 11 those dreams turned to rubble			0
when a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and devastating tsunami hit @entity14 's @entity36 , the city of @entity33 was one of the hardest hit			1
tens of thousands of people from the area were killed or remain unaccounted for			0
every aspect of life was affected and the city 's beloved soccer club -- majority owned by the city and the @entity48 - was no different			0
the team 's stadium was declared to be " in ruins " by @entity10 chairman @entity53 , its training ground destroyed			1
@entity7 's foreign players , so traumatized by what they saw , canceled their contracts and returned home			1
the players that remained helped in the clean up operation and ran soccer camps for the orphans			0
" immediately after the earthquake and tsunami we , as a team , wondered if we should , and could , continue to play soccer , " said the team 's coach , @entity65			1
but it was controversially decided that the @entity10 would continue			2
the club was homeless and its fans traumatized but @entity65 believed that @entity7 could " be the symbol of hope for the entire @entity36 and to lead and encourage the reconstruction efforts with our strong performance			2
" which is exactly what happened			0
despite only ever being a minor footnote in @entity14 's soccer history , @entity7 went on an incredible 11 game unbeaten run and sat at the top of the league table			1
before their first match of the restarted season against @entity89 the fans displayed a banner that read : " thank you for all [ our ] friends			2
we do not lose until we regain a hometown			0
" by the time the team did eventually lose for the first time , @entity7 had been good to their word			1
not only did they beat @entity89 2 - 1 in dramatic fashion that day , the stadium was quickly rebuilt and the team returned for the rest of the season			2
" everyone who follows the j league was shocked by @entity33 's performance			0
i met so many people who were encouraged by @entity7			0
at the same time , they , fans and players , know that to keep on keeping on is important , " explained @entity107 , a writer for @entity14 's leading @entity109 magazine			1
" the people in @entity33 started a rush constructing job on the stadium			0
although there was some serious damage after march 11 they could host a game against @entity120 on april 29			0
so the speed of reconstruction of the stadium was very fast			0
" not everyone could watch @entity7 's matches though			2
" people in @entity36 still could n't watch that game as there was no electricity , " he added after losing for the first time in june many in @entity14 assumed that @entity7 would then plummet like a stone			1
but after a brief drop in form the team went on another 11 game unbeaten run that only ended last november			2
" to have one good run is difficult to do under the circumstances , " said @entity107			0
" to have another good run and bounce back to the top table of the j - league made people in @entity33 and @entity36 proud			0
" in the end , @entity7 's fairytale dream of winning their first ever @entity10 championship was a bridge too far			1
but their fourth placed finish represented their best ever season			0
the 2012 @entity10 season began last saturday , the day before the anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami			1
@entity7 started as they ended last season with a 1 - 0 win against @entity155			2
but like the @entity14 women 's national team , who famously won the @entity161 last june by beating the @entity162 in the final , @entity7 's performances on the pitch resonated far outside soccer			1
" what @entity7 and @entity166 [ @entity14 's women 's national soccer team ] show is how not to give up , " said @entity107			1
" that 's why @entity14 people cheered for the team			1
but that cheer was probably not only for the team			0
it was also for ourselves and the people who suffered			0

@entity14 *football* team @entity7 had best ever season last year
finished fourth in @entity14 's @entity10
team 's stadium was ruined by last year 's earthquake
