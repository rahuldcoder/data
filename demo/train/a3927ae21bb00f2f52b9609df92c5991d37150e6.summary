@entity0 -- most @entity2 will feel the impact of forced budget cuts when their lives intersect with government -- trying to get through airport security to make a flight , visiting a national park , or using federal programs or assistance			1
@entity12 can avert the automatic cuts , called sequester , if it compromises on a deficit - reduction plan before the march 1 deadline			0

like the @entity57 , any furloughs would begin in late april or early may , the start of the busy summer travel season			1
budget cuts will mean more time at the airport education the @entity88 budget would also be trimmed			2
proposed spending cuts would do the most damage to educational programs that heavily serve low income families			0
about 70,000 children could be forced out of @entity94 , which promotes school readiness for children from birth to age 5			1
further cuts to the education budget would also mean less money for schools and districts nationwide			2
the real impact of automatic spending cuts and why they may happen after all @entity106 while @entity107 and @entity108 will be protected , primary and preventive care , like flu vaccinations , could be closed off to hundreds of thousands of @entity2			1
cuts to mental health funding will leave over 350,000 @entity2 untreated			1
food and workplace safety is also in danger			0
the @entity117 , which ensures safe workplaces and investigates accidents on the job would lose about 1,200 inspections , diminishing its oversight			2

this cut will affect 3.8 million @entity2 , who use these benefits to pay for food and housing while trying to find jobs in a damaged economy			1
the proposed cuts will also limit resources at job finding centers , a move the could heavily damage the livelihood of those who are already struggling			0
