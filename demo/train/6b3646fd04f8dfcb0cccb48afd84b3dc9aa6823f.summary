@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 and former boyfriend @entity5 are killers and the evidence proves it , a prosecutor insisted friday in wrapping up her statement in the duo 's appeal of their 2009 murder convictions			1
@entity13 and @entity5 were convicted of killing @entity13 's former roommate , @entity15 , in a bloody crime that left the victim half - naked with her throat slashed			1
@entity13 's attorneys argued in their closing arguments thursday that police had made numerous mistakes investigating the crime and that evidence did n't support the convictions			1
but prosecutor @entity26 said the evidence is clear , from bloody footprints with particular characteristics that match the two to the very spot where @entity13 's dna was found on a kitchen knife believed by investigators to be the murder weapon			1
" they are young , but so was @entity15			1
and they have killed for nothing			2
and for this they must be condemned to the maximum sentence , " @entity26 said			0
the hearing was expected to continue friday with an attorney for @entity45 's family addressing the court			0
no ruling is expected until monday , when @entity13 and @entity5 are expected to give final statements , according to the judge			1
at friday 's hearing , prosecutor @entity50 said @entity13 and @entity5 tried to blame the killing on another co-defendant , @entity15 , because @entity54 is black			1
@entity54 was also convicted in the case and is already serving a 16 - year sentence			0
@entity26 , showed jurors a photograph of a bloody footprint found in the bathroom of the home were @entity45 was killed			0
there was no way the footprint was @entity54 's as defense attorneys had contended , @entity26 argued			0
@entity26 said experts have concluded that the footprint was not @entity54 's and probably was @entity5			1
she also told the court that just because the footprint was found " not usable " for positive identification , it does n't mean that they are " non usable ' " when you can do a process of elimination			0
@entity26 also used her microphone to demonstrate the how the location where @entity13 's dna was found on the presumed murder weapon -- at the junction between the blade and the handle -- suggests a stabbing motion , rather than a cutting motion			1
on thursday , @entity13 's attorneys gave their final arguments to counter prosecutors ' portrayal of her as a cunning " femme fatale			1
" lawyer @entity85 told the jury " that the only possible decision to take is that of absolving @entity4 , " as he wrapped up his closing argument			1
he said the court had seen no trace of @entity4 in the room where the murder took place			2
another one of @entity13 's lawyers , @entity94 , said she was " very afraid but her heart is full of hope " that she will be freed			2
her " image was massacred " by the media and the attacks on her character started before the trial , he said , adding that he considered her as a daughter			0
concluding an emotional appearance , he appealed to the jury to put themselves in the shoes of @entity13 's family -- a counterpoise to the words of appeals court prosecutor @entity115 , who asked the jury to put themselves in the shoes of @entity45 's family at the start of the closing arguments a week ago			1
the " @entity13 " -- as @entity13 's family have been referred to -- are not part of some rumored @entity123 conspiracy to put pressure on the @entity1 courts to release her , @entity94 said			2
rather , " they are parents and they deserve respect			0
" the lawyer also praised the court 's work , saying he felt @entity13 's rights had finally been respected			2
urging the jury not to let innocent people stay in jail , @entity85 earlier detailed what he called many " mistakes " made in the investigation into @entity45 's death			2
when @entity13 was arrested and interrogated , she was not allowed a translator and was discouraged from getting a lawyer , @entity85 said			2
" ' that night @entity4 's right to defend herself was denied , " he said			2
" she was just a young girl , first time out of the country			0
she did n't speak @entity1			0
" @entity85 argued that some of the dna evidence presented by the prosecution should be thrown out			0
he said some material was contaminated as a result of poor practice by police , including supposed traces of mixed blood in the bathroom sink shared by the two girls			0
the prosecution 's use of alleged bloody footprints in their case was also wrong , he said			0
as for the knife used to kill @entity45 , a key piece of evidence , @entity85 told the court there was a " concentration of nothingness , a fantasy " in the prosecution 's arguments			0
he ridiculed a theory that @entity5 had not disposed of the knife because he was concerned his landlady would notice it was missing , asking : " what kind of a killer would think about this after committing a murder ? " @entity13 and @entity5 were convicted in 2009			1
@entity13 was sentenced to 26 years in prison , while @entity5 got 25			1
@entity2 's @entity180 contributed to this report .			0
