@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 gov. @entity3 , favored to win re-election and a historic sixth term in november , credits his famous facial hair for his political success			1
" i 've never lost , and i 've always done it with a mustache , so i 'm going to keep it , " he told me			0
first elected governor in 1982 at the tender age of 36 , he went on to serve four terms , stepping down in 2000			0
but he came out of retirement six years ago and rode a @entity17 wave back into office			0
if voters return him to office this fall , the 67 - year - old will have served over 20 years as governor , making him the longest - serving executive in @entity24 history			2
one reason for @entity3 's winning streak is that he 's much more of a hardball politician than his aw - shucks @entity29 demeanor suggests			1
earlier this year , @entity3 , the definition of an establishment @entity32 , successfully deployed his political machine in an effort to reclaim the @entity17 from the clutches of tea party leadership			1
so far this year , in his race against @entity40 @entity39 , he 's been able to weather administration scandals and accusations of corruption			1
one @entity40 told me that for @entity1 voters , @entity3 is " like an old sweater " — just the comfortable choice			1
@entity48 : the secret weapon that could save @entity1 @entity50 ? @entity3 was talking about his whiskers while giving me a private tour of the picturesque @entity1 state capital for the latest episode of " @entity55 , " showing off the knick - knacks and ceremonial gifts that decorate his hideaway office , normally off - limits to reporters			1
he pointed proudly to his hunting trophies , a photo with pope @entity63 , and an @entity65 football jersey with " @entity66 " emblazoned on the back			0
upstairs in the state capitol , we examined baseballs signed by players who had jogged the bases at @entity74 in @entity75			0
then we were guided up to the very top of the gilded state capitol for a stunning autumn view of downtown @entity0			0
as the talk turned to 2016 and the looming parade of @entity32 presidential contenders set to march through @entity1 , @entity3 brushed off criticism that the caucuses favor uncompromising social conservatives over more moderate @entity32			1
@entity85 : @entity87 's madcap media mob he has a point			2
@entity90 , not exactly a favorite son of the @entity92 right , almost won the caucuses			0
there 's a sizable pool of mainstream @entity32 here waiting to be courted , and in a crowded presidential field , a candidate can win the state with a plurality — and without unified support from social conservatives			2
" you need to come here early and often , " @entity3 said , invoking the example of @entity104 , who came out of nowhere to win @entity1 after campaigning in the state 's 99 counties ( and , it should be noted , after wearing his conservative catholic faith on his sleeve )			1
@entity3 would not say if he would endorse a candidate but said he 's favorable to @entity32 governors — no surprise there — a comment that should warm the hearts of @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			1
@entity121 heading to 2016 primary state as for the ( in ) famous @entity123 , that media - saturated , oft - criticized and nonbinding summertime test of candidate support , @entity3 backed away from previous suggestions that the fundraiser should be scrapped			2
i asked him if the @entity17 - run @entity123 will actually happen next summer in the run - up to the caucuses			0
@entity3 said maybe , but floated another option			2
" it 's going to depend on the candidates and who is willing to participate , " he said			0
" i think having a series of fundraisers regionally around the state would be a good alternative			0

@entity1 gov. @entity3 is vying for a historic sixth term
in this year 's race , @entity3 has weathered scandals and accusations of corruption
@entity3 would *n't* say if he *'d* endorse a presidential candidate
