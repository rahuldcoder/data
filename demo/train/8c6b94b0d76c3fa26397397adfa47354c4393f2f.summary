@entity0 -- a congressional panel investigating claims the @entity3 mishandled the remains of hundreds of fallen @entity6 military personnel will meet for the first time tuesday			1
in november , @entity6 @entity9 investigators announced they had found " serious misconduct " and " gross mismanagement " in the handling of remains at the base			1
the findings came after the @entity9 conducted a year - long investigation into 14 allegations of wrongdoing made by whistleblowers involving the remains of four @entity6 service members killed in action , the @entity16 official said			1
the panel , which is being chaired by retired gen. @entity26 , has been given " full authority to review all aspects of mortuary affairs to ensure we are meeting the highest standards of care for our fallen			2
" @entity16 spokesman capt. @entity33 said			2
@entity26 retired from the @entity34 in 2007 after leading @entity35 the final three years of his 34 - year military career			0
last week , the @entity9 admitted that it sent more sets of military personnel remains to a @entity40 landfill than it originally acknowledged			2
backtracking on initial information about how it handled the remains of @entity6 service members killed in @entity44 and @entity45 , the @entity9 said the cremated body parts of hundreds of the fallen were burned and dumped in the landfill			1
earlier , the @entity9 said only a small number of body parts had been buried in a commercial landfill and claimed it would be impossible to make a final determination of how many remains were disposed of in that manner			1
the @entity53 broke the story , and the @entity9 now confirms that body fragments linked to at least 274 fallen military personnel sent to the base mortuary were cremated , incinerated and buried with medical waste			1
that procedure was in place between november 2003 and may 1 , 2008			0
the @entity9 also said that 1,762 body parts were never identified and also were disposed of , first by cremation , then by further incineration and then buried in a landfill			1
congressman @entity65 , @entity66 , thursday accused the @entity16 of what he called " willful blindness " in not acting faster to identify and correct the problems and fully report them			2
" for years , this has been handled unceremoniously and insensitively and , i would say , dishonorably , " @entity65 said in a telephone interview			0
he said he had been asking the @entity16 for months about information about @entity3 , on behalf of a constituent whose husband was killed five years ago			1
" they do n't get it			0
they do n't understand the degree of dishonor involved in all of this , " @entity65 said			0
last month , the @entity16 told the congressman that exact numbers could not be determined			0
" without individual case - by - case review , the exact number of service - directed disposition of subsequent remains can not be determined , " said a fact sheet sent to @entity65 in november			1
" it would require a massive effort and time to recall records and research individually			0
" when bodies are not intact -- for instance , in the aftermath of a crash or explosion -- a body may be released to the family before some parts have been identified by the @entity99 at @entity3 in @entity100			1
families can elect to be notified when parts are identified or leave it up to the military to dispose of them appropriately			2
since the policy was changed in 2008 , the unclaimed body parts are buried at sea			1
@entity65 pointed to how the @entity6 spends millions each year searching for the remains of service members missing in action from previous wars , for instance in @entity113			1
" that makes us proud to be an @entity6 , that we would do that , " @entity65 said			0
" it is a level of response that honors our soldiers			0
" the mistakes at @entity3 send a different message , @entity65 said			2
" it sends shudders to think that we engage in this kind of desecration , " he said			0
but at the @entity16 , aides to @entity128 said he is satisfied with how the @entity9 responded in regard to the landfill policy and new information about how many of the @entity6 fallen were involved			0
" i think the secretary is comfortable with the way the @entity9 has handled this , " said @entity33			0
@entity1 's @entity136 and @entity137			0
