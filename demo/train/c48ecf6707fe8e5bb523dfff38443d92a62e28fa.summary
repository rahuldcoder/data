@entity0 -- the lawyer for one of the men accused in the gang rape and murder of a 23 - year - old woman wants the trial moved out of @entity0 , where emotions have run high over the case			1
the defense lawyer will argue before the @entity13 @entity12 on wednesday that transferring legal proceedings outside the @entity13 capital would ensure a free and fair hearing			1
his appearance , which was originally scheduled for tuesday , was pushed back a day			0
meanwhile , a panel appointed by @entity13 's home affairs minister after the incident delivered a 600 - page report wednesday criticizing authorities and even everyday @entity13 for their apathy and " low and skewed priority of dealing with complaints of sexual assault			1
" the group said social failings , not adequate criminal laws , are to blame for the lackadaisical treatment of sexual assault in @entity13			1
" failure of good governance is the obvious root cause for the current unsafe environment eroding the rule of law , and not the want of needed legislation , " the panel said in its report			0
however , the group did make several policy recommendations , including creating a new offense of gang rape punishable by at least 20 years in prison , making it a crime for police to fail to investigate sexual assault complaints and making it illegal to consider character or previous sexual experience of the victim at a criminal trial			1
@entity55 of the @entity56 called the report a " landmark document			0
" the case that sparked the panel 's review -- the december 16 gang rape of a woman in @entity0 -- has gripped @entity13 , prompting protests in the capital and other cites over the treatment of women and criticism of the way sexual assault cases are dealt with			1
opinion : @entity13 's rape problem needs a rewiring of society 's attitude the consequences of the case are still unfolding in the @entity13 news media , with calls for tougher punishment of people convicted of rape			1
the five adult suspects in the december 16 incident appeared at a closed - door hearing at a fast - track court in @entity0 on monday			1
details about what was said in court can not be reported under a judge 's ruling imposing restrictions on coverage of the case			0
police say the suspects attacked the woman and her male companion on a bus , robbed them and dumped them by the side of the road			0
the woman , badly injured in the attack , died two weeks later , despite being flown to @entity106 for treatment			2
the five men are charged with murder , rape and kidnapping and could face the death penalty if convicted			2
a sixth suspect , who is believed to be too young to be tried as an adult , is facing proceedings in a juvenile court			0
@entity13 rape debate : why death penalty is no solution the case is being heard in a " fast - track " court , which @entity13 introduced to try to expedite cases in a justice system bogged down by red tape			1
it means that sessions of the trial , once it begins , should take place nearly every working day until a verdict is reached			0
the hearing monday was a procedural step at which the charge sheet detailing prosecutors ' accusations against the suspects was submitted			0
the trial will begin once the prosecution 's arguments are made in court			0
rape case ' an awakening ' for @entity13 , victim 's father says the next hearing is scheduled for thursday , according to defense lawyers			1
the magistrates ' court that initially heard the case imposed restrictions on what the news media can report about events in court			0
that practice is common in rape cases in @entity13 to protect the victim 's identity , and the magistrate said it was also necessary out of concern for the suspects ' safety amid intense media coverage and widespread anger			2
@entity13 rape victim 's family wants hospital in her village authorities have not released the name of the dead woman , but @entity13 protesters have been calling her @entity172 , which means " lightning " in @entity173			1
" @entity172 " is also a 1993 @entity176 film whose lead female character fights for a housemaid , a victim of sexual assault			1
companion of @entity13 rape victim : i begged attackers to stop the events have also focused the attention of the @entity13 news media on attacks against women around the huge country			2
newspapers and television stations have been reporting other shocking rape allegations on an almost daily basis			0
in one of the most recent examples , police in the eastern state of @entity199 arrested six men after they were accused of gang - raping a 25 - year - old woman sunday as she was on her way home from visiting her brother at a hospital			1
the six men , including two who worked as custodians at the hospital , are alleged to have taken the woman to an isolated area by a river and sexually assaulted her , said @entity214 , a police superintendent in the district of @entity216			2
police are waiting for medical reports on the suspects to determine whether to take the case to court , @entity214 said			0
the number of reported rapes in @entity13 -- a country where a cultural stigma keeps many victims from reporting the crime -- has increased from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011 , according to official figures			0
most women in @entity13 have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets , the @entity13 council on @entity229 says			2
@entity1 's @entity236 and @entity237 in @entity238 and journalist @entity239 in @entity0 contributed to this report .			0
