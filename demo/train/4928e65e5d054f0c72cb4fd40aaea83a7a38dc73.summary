-- confidence -- on the court and off it , @entity2 is finding her mojo again			1
a year ago the tennis star was diagnosed with a debilitating auto - immune disease during the @entity7 , but next week she will step back on the courts of her home grand slam tournament boosted by her recent results and the relaunch of her fashion label			1
@entity2 defended her women 's doubles gold medal at the recent @entity16 alongside younger sister @entity17 , who has roared back from her own health problems to win both the @entity19 and @entity21 singles titles			1
" the @entity22 really built my confidence , " the 32 - year - old @entity2 told @entity0			1
" i was n't able to play a lot of matches beforehand -- just three matches in about two months , which is not a lot			0
" so going to the @entity22 i did n't have a lot of matches , but i made the best of it and i played i think some of my best tennis of the year			2
" @entity33 ready for @entity7 farewell the former world no. 1 's passion , fashion , is also on the upswing following the recent relaunch of her label @entity40 at an event in @entity42 -- which also hosts the @entity7			1
" @entity44 is about being better than a 10 , " said the current world no. 47			1
" so it 's about being a personal best , it 's about not accepting any limits , that anyone puts on you or that you can even put on yourself , because sometimes we do			2
" it 's about expressing yourself for who you are			2
so @entity44 means a lot of things but it just means bringing out the best in you			0
" i feel that when i wear @entity40 , i feel my best			1
so i want people to feel their best when they wear @entity40 , confident and good about themselves			1
" throughout her career , the seven - time grand slam champion has been as well known for her striking outfits as she has her powerful tennis strokes			1
some of them pushed the boundaries of sporting design , and @entity2 said she is reining in her more experimental urges			1
" some of my favorite things were the goddess dress that i wore at @entity19 , i think it was 2007 , " she said			0
" and one of the craziest ones was the can - can dress			2
" that was my idea of having lace on skin			0
for me it was fun , and it was experimental because at that time it was just me wearing it			0
but at that time i was like , ' what can i do that can be worn on the court ? can you wear lace ? yes			0
can you wear fringe ? ' " because i did this fun dress after @entity87 , and it was so fun , but at this point the experiments are over and it 's about bringing classic designs			0
" tennis legends tip @entity93 for grand slam glory at @entity7 @entity2 ' obsession with design is such that she took time away from playing tennis to gain a fashion degree			1
" to get my degree was important to me , mostly because of how i grew up -- my parents always chose education -- so for me it felt like an achievement to be able to do that , " she said			0
" but also i love fashion , and i knew it was something that i wanted to do , and i wanted to bring credibility to it , and i have to say the education helps a ton , so it 's served me very well			2
" @entity2 said she is excited about all the elements of her life coming together again			2
" i 'm very excited about my game , i 'm excited about tennis , i 'm excited about wearing all the new @entity115 clothes , " she said			0
" there are so many wonderful things coming up so i think between great tennis and great fashions on the court , it 's going to be an amazing @entity7 for me			0
" @entity2 is , however , still coming to terms with her battle against @entity124 -- which can cause extreme fatigue among its symptoms			1
" i 've come a long way , and i 've gone through a lot of ups and downs for sure , " she said			0
" when you have an auto - immune disease , you ca n't expect everything to be the way it was before			0
you have to take the set of circumstances you have , and work with those			0
" i 'm working on it every day , but i know that i can live this dream and i think it gives a lot of other people hope , because it 's not easy , but you know i 'm working on it			0
" the story of the @entity2 sisters ' rise to prominence , their dominance of the women 's game and the struggles they have both experienced in recent years -- with @entity17 surviving potentially life - threatening blood clots -- has captivated tennis fans			1
they have won a combined total of 33 singles and doubles grand slam titles , so what lies ahead as they approach the twilight of their tennis careers ? " there 's a lot more clothes to design , " @entity2 said			1
" @entity17 and i both want to play the @entity22 , we think that 'd be a great place to shine for us and for the @entity168 and everything			2
" so we 're not done yet , we still have great tennis in us , and it 's amazing to do this every day			0
