@entity8 said in his first state of the union speech on tuesday that governments " must respect human rights			2

the @entity3 is the executive arm of the @entity32			2
" in @entity30 there is no room for discrimination , " @entity8 said			1
" that 's why we are going to make these independent assessments with the @entity5 authorities and with the other countries , because , in fact , the @entity6 issue is a general problem			1
