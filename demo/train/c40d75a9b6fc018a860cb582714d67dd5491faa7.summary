-- your phone always knows where you are			0
and now , if you want , your @entity5 friends will always know where you are , too			2
@entity5 is introducing a mobile feature called @entity8 that taps into that steady stream of location information so friends can track each other in real time			1
the idea is to make it easy for people to meet up in real life , so they can have conversations in person instead of comment threads , temporarily replacing likes and lols with eye contact and actual laughter			0
a live meet - up is also an excellent opportunity to grab a selfie with your pal and upload it to the @entity5 owned @entity29			2
in a refreshing change , the new @entity8 feature is not turned on by default			1
friends will not be able to see where you are unless you decide live - tracking is something you want in your life and visit @entity5 's settings to turn it on			1
making a potentially invasive new feature opt - in suggests @entity5 has perhaps learned from some of its past mistakes and privacy problems			1
you can choose to share your general location with all your @entity5 friends , close friends or a customized list of people you feel most comfortable with			1
further minimizing the potential stalking factor , your location is only shared with other people who are also using the feature and who have chosen to share their location with you			2
when turned on , @entity8 shows a list of approved @entity5 friends who also use the feature and shows their approximate location			1
a push notification can tell you how many of your friends are nearby			0
open the app to see a list of pals , the neighborhood or city where they are , how many miles away that is from your current location , and a time stamp of when they where there			0
there is an option to share your exact location with specific friends , which can be handy for coordinating large groups at concerts or finding someone in a crowded area			1
your friends will see a little image of your face on a map for a set period of time			0
nearby friends will be available on @entity5 's ios and @entity91 apps , but will only work for select locations at first			1
@entity5 , @entity29 and many other apps already include features that let people " check - in " to locations , but those location features are different because you decide if and when to share each specific location			1
you might check into a @entity101 downtown , but never into your home or other spot you 'd rather keep private			0
nearby friends is continuously gathering details about where you are in the background instead of waiting for a manual check - in			2
this is not the first time an app has used location information to physically connect friends			0
similar apps such as @entity115 , which got a flurry of attention in 2012 , mapped out the locations of nearby strangers			0
@entity5 also purchased a startup in 2012 called @entity121 that also connected strangers			0
that technology evolved into this new , more private feature			0
if you turn on the @entity8 feature , @entity5 starts collecting data on your exact location and keeps details on where you 've been in the past , not just places where you 've used its app to check in			1
it also collects location information even when the @entity5 app is closed			2
but you can turn off this location history in the @entity5 app 's settings			2
it 's possible to delete individual locations from a history , or clear the whole thing and start from scratch .			0

@entity5 's @entity8 feature shares your general location with chosen friends
the tracking tool is opt - in so people wo *n't* *accidentally* share their location by default
nearby friends also has an option for sharing a user 's exact location on a map
