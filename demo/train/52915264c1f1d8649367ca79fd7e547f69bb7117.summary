@entity0 -- a series of blog posts on monday purportedly by @entity4 said he leaked classified details about @entity7 surveillance programs because president @entity8 worsened " abusive " practices instead of curtailing them as he promised as a candidate			1
in 90 minutes of live online chatting , the person identified as @entity4 by @entity15 's @entity14 newspaper and website insisted that @entity7 authorities have access to phone calls , e-mails and other communications far beyond constitutional bounds			1
while he said legal restrictions can be easily skirted by analysts at the @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , @entity4 stopped short of accusing authorities of violating specific laws			1
instead , he said toothless regulations and policies were to blame for what he called " suspicionless surveillance , " and he warned that policies can be changed to allow further abuses			0
" this disclosure provides @entity8 an opportunity to appeal for a return to sanity , constitutional policy , and the rule of law rather than men , " he posted			1
" he still has plenty of time to go down in history as the president who looked into the abyss and stepped back , rather than leaping forward into it			0
" @entity8 bristles at suggestion he 's shifted on snooping asked monday if the @entity26 was following the online chat , the agency 's press office had no immediate comment			1
@entity8 , top legislators and national security officials defend the surveillance programs as necessary to combat terrorism , arguing that some privacy must be sacrificed in a balanced approach			1
they say the law allows collection of metadata , such as the time and numbers of phone calls , and that a special federal court must approve accessing the content -- listening to the call itself			0
in the blog posts on monday , the writer identified as @entity4 contended the government 's overbroad collection of information violated rights of innocent @entity7 who have no links to suspicious activity			1
referring to a program that permits broader access to foreign communications than is allowed for domestic monitoring , the writer said authorities sidestep regulations			0
for example , a phone call from overseas can mean automatic inclusion of a @entity7 number in the record - keeping , according to the writer			0
" the reality is that ... @entity7 ' communications are collected and viewed on a daily basis on the certification of an analyst rather than a warrant , " one @entity4 post said			1
" they excuse this as ' incidental ' collection , but at the end of the day , someone at @entity26 still has the content of your communications			1
" another post warned that restrictions against unauthorized access to the content of communications -- such as listening to phone calls or reading e-mails -- were based on policy rather than technology and therefore " can change at any time			2
" @entity1 poll : @entity8 numbers plunge into generation gap @entity4 said he leaked details of the surveillance programs because @entity8 campaigned for the presidency on a platform of ending abuses			1
however , @entity8 " closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law , deepened and expanded several abusive programs , and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in @entity136 , where men still sit without charge , " a blog post said			1
@entity4 also said that he had to get out of the @entity7 before the leaks were published by the @entity14 and @entity140 to avoid being targeted by the government			1
the @entity7 government " predictably destroyed any possibility of a fair trial at home " by " openly declaring me guilty of treason , " @entity4 said			1
@entity4 , who is believed to be in @entity147 , also wrote that the truth about surveillance programs he disclosed will come out , and " the @entity7 government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me			1
" details on @entity26 - thwarted plots coming , lawmaker says the blog post rejected accusations that he had or might provide classified information to @entity157 , saying he only leaked to journalists and calling such a charge a smear tactic intended to turn public opinion against his effort to provide @entity7 with full information about how their government monitors them			1
a @entity1 / @entity166 poll released monday showed 54 % of respondents did n't approve of @entity4 's admitted actions , while 44 % backed the leaks			1
@entity4 's father told @entity171 that he hoped and prayed his son " will not release any secrets that could constitute treason			2
" the father , @entity175 , also said he wanted his son to return to the @entity7 " and face this , " adding " i love my son			2
" @entity4 , 29 , worked for the @entity26 through a private contractor firm until may , when he decamped to @entity147			1
he went public earlier this month as the source of articles by the newspapers , saying the agency 's efforts pose " an existential threat to democracy			0
" the revelations about the @entity26 's collection of millions of records from @entity7 telecommunications and technology firms have led to a furious debate within the @entity7 about the scale and scope of surveillance programs that date from the days after the 2001 @entity196 attacks on @entity197 and @entity0			1
opinion : did @entity26 snooping stop ' dozens ' of terrorist attacks ? defenders say the programs -- approved by @entity202 after a warrantless surveillance effort under the @entity205 administration was revealed in 2005 -- have protected @entity7 lives by helping agents break up terrorism plots			1
and they argue that the program is under close oversight by all three branches of government , including the congressional intelligence committees and a court set up under the @entity215 that hears cases in secret			2
but @entity218 , the @entity14 columnist who broke @entity4 's story and moderated the chat , said the safeguards placed on the program is " a very symbolic and empty oversight that really ought not to give the assurances to anybody that these powers are n't being abused			1
" " they go once every six months to the @entity215 court , " he said			0
" the @entity215 court rubber - stamps these vague guidelines that the @entity26 says they 're using to make sure they 're complying with the law			2
and once that happens , the @entity26 can force telecoms and @entity235 companies to give them whatever they demand under the guise that the @entity215 court has blessed their guidelines			2
" bigger threat : @entity4 or @entity26 ? critics call the programs an unconstitutional overreach of authority under the @entity243 , the law that authorized increased government surveillance in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks			1
in a new development , the @entity14 reported sunday that @entity15 's electronic intelligence agency monitored delegates ' phones and tried to capture their passwords during an economic summit held there in 2009			0
targets included @entity15 allies such as @entity258 and @entity259 , the newspaper reported			0
the @entity14 cited documents provided by @entity4			2
according to the newspaper , the documents show that the @entity15 " signals intelligence " agency @entity261 used " ground - breaking intelligence capabilities " to intercept calls made by members of the @entity266 conference delegations at meetings in @entity268			0
@entity271 , @entity270 disclose information on user data requests analysts received round - the - clock summaries of calls that were being made , and @entity261 set up internet cafes for delegates in hopes of intercepting e-mails and capturing keystrokes , the @entity14 reported			0
one briefing slide explained the intercepts would give intelligence agencies the ability to read delegates ' e-mails " before / as they do , " providing " sustained intelligence options against them even after ( the ) conference has finished			0
" @entity261 is @entity15 's equivalent of the secretive @entity26 in the @entity7			2
the @entity14 reported that the @entity26 had attempted to eavesdrop on then - @entity295 president @entity294 during the conference as his phone calls passed through satellite links to @entity299 and briefed its @entity15 counterparts on the effects			2
the latest report was published on the eve of a smaller economic summit hosted by the @entity15 government -- the @entity307 gathering in @entity308			0
@entity309 , a spokesman for the @entity7 @entity310 , said sunday he was aware of the @entity14 's latest report but declined to comment on it			0
" what we should be focused on is how irresponsible and egregious these recent leaks are , " he told @entity1			0
" it 's impossible to know exactly how much damage is being done by these disclosures , but they will have an effect on our counterterrorism efforts			0
" @entity322 defends @entity26 , calls @entity8 's credibility ' nonexistent ' retired gen. @entity324 , a former @entity26 director , said on @entity1 's " @entity325 " that what the agency collects are " essentially billing records " that detail the time , duration and phone numbers involved in a call			1
the records are added to a database that agents can query in cases involving a terror investigation overseas , and agents ca n't eavesdrop on @entity7 ' calls without an order from a secret court that handles intelligence matters , he said			0
if a phone number related to an investigation has links to a domestic phone number , " we 've got to go back to the court , " he said			0
@entity347 tries to keep focus on @entity349 targeting scandal however , critics such as sen. @entity352 , a member of the @entity353 , had raised questions about the scale of the program even before @entity4 's leak			2
@entity352 said on @entity359 's " @entity358 " on sunday that he does n't believe the program is making @entity7 any safer , " and i think it 's ultimately , perhaps , a violation of the @entity363			0
" " i think we owe it to the @entity7 people to have a fulsome debate in the open about the extent of these programs , " said @entity352 , a @entity365 @entity364			0
" you have a law that 's been interpreted secretly by a secret court that then issues secret orders to generate a secret program			0
i just do n't think this is an @entity7 approach to a world in which we have great threats			0
" @entity8 does not feel that he has violated the privacy of any @entity7 , his chief of staff , @entity381 , said on the @entity384 program " @entity385			2
" @entity381 said the president will be discussing the need to " find the right balance , especially in this new situation where we find ourselves with all of us reliant on @entity235 , on e-mail , on texting			0
" @entity147 rallies in the rain for @entity4 @entity1 's @entity393 , @entity394 and @entity395 contributed to this report .			2
