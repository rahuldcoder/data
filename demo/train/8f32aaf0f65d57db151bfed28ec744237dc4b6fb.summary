@entity0 , @entity1 -- pope @entity3 arrived in @entity1 's southeastern city of @entity1 on monday , delivering @entity5 before throngs of @entity7 in only the second papal visit in the island 's history			1
he was greeted upon his arrival by @entity7 president @entity12 and the nation 's clergy , including @entity7 cardinal @entity15			0
with a red carpet rolled out to meet the pope 's airplane , @entity12 walked beside the pontiff to a pair of large wooden chairs			0
a brass band played @entity1 's national anthem and other tunes as they stood together , while artillery rounds were fired off nearby in celebration			2
@entity3 told the audience that he seeks to emphasize " the importance of faith , " highlighting the need for good relations between the church and the @entity32 state			1
@entity12 welcomed @entity3 , saying his country has endeavored for peace and justice , but noted that even " 14 years after @entity41 's visit , " the @entity39 economic embargo against @entity1 persists			1
clad all in white , @entity3 walked with @entity12 , who was dressed in a dark suit , and greeted other state officials and clergy			1
crowds of flag - waving @entity7 lined the street on which @entity3 's motorcade traveled , as @entity7 state television captured both ground and aerial footage of the trip			1
later monday evening , @entity3 delivered @entity5 in the city 's square , drawing huge crowds as legions of musicians playing wind and string instruments performed during pauses in his sermon , supported by what appeared to be concert - grade sound systems			2
the visit marks the next - to - last leg of a two - country tour the pope has used to both spread the catholic faith and address political issues in the region			2
his first stop was in @entity75 , where he denounced violence in that country brought by the ongoing drug wars			0
@entity3 also blasted @entity1 's @entity32 political system friday , saying it " no longer corresponds to reality			1
" the pope 's comment , delivered to reporters aboard a flight from @entity85 to @entity75 , sparked widespread speculation as to what he would say when he addresses the @entity7 people directly			0
the island nation 's foreign minister , @entity89 , responding to the comment , said his government considers " the exchange of ideas useful " and is still perfecting its system			1
the pope is scheduled to meet again with @entity12 and @entity15 in @entity0 , along with the president 's family , which could include @entity100 , who stepped down from power in 2006 after battling illness			1
@entity104 president @entity103 also arrived on the island saturday , according to @entity7 state television , which reported he is there to undergo further radiation treatment for cancer			2
it is not clear whether @entity3 will meet @entity103			2
@entity3 , 84 , is due to fly to the @entity7 capital on tuesday , and preside over a @entity5 in @entity0 's @entity111 on the following day			1
preparations for the visit have included fresh coats of paint splashed across buildings and posters announcing the pope 's arrival tacked on city structures			2
the trip is timed to the 400th anniversary of @entity124 , @entity1 's patron saint , but uncertainty looms over what will be said , with whom the pope will meet and what the visit will mean for @entity7			1
" for me , i 'm very happy he 's coming , " said @entity131 , a shopkeeper in the capital 's @entity0 neighborhood			2
" i was here when ( @entity135 ) @entity41 came , and there were always plenty of tourists that followed			0
" the visit is seen as a possible tourism boost to the island 's cash - strapped economy as many residents seek to make use of a series of recent free market reforms that have slowly swelled the number of private businesses in the country			2
fourteen years earlier , a much different @entity100 greeted a much different pontiff when thousands were introduced to @entity152 , who made the historic first papal trip to @entity1 in 1998			1
having been invited by then - president @entity100 , @entity41 famously urged the country " to open to the world , and the world to open to @entity1			0
" " there was a kind of love affair between @entity41 and @entity163 , " said @entity159 @entity158 analyst @entity157			0
" it just is n't the same with @entity3			0
" in @entity75 , an archbishop called on worshippers to stop making comparisons between @entity3 and the former pope , who drew massive crowds across @entity163 and visited every country in the region before he died in 2005			1
in @entity1 , though @entity41 helped warm church - government relations , the nation 's ties with religion have remained complicated			1
decades earlier , @entity12 's communist revolution sought to stamp out religious influence in @entity1 , confiscating church property and expelling religious workers , some of whom had supported anti-castro forces			1
the country was officially atheist until the 1990s , when the constitution was amended and references to atheism were replaced with secularism			0
@entity188 was recognized as a holiday at that time and @entity191 members were permitted to openly practice their faith , if they had one			1
church officials now say the island is about 60 % @entity197 , though few openly practice			1
still , religious access to state television and the administering of religious schools remain largely restricted , which could be a point of emphasis during the pontiff 's trip , observers say			0
" these papal visits can have an impact , " @entity157 said			0
" they can kind of jar things lose			0
and it seems that under @entity12 , @entity1 is taking baby steps toward normalization			0
" but many on the island seem skeptical that the trip will yield lasting results			0
while the country 's @entity217 has often been lauded for its role in recent reforms , it has also received heavy criticism for appearing too cozy with the government			0
rights group say the nation has largely emptied its jails of political prisoners , and yet it continues to harass the country 's activists .			0
