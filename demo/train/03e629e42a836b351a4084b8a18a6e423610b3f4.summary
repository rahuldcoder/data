-- here 's a snapshot of @entity3 's defining experiences : beaches , cities , and food and wine			1
get a sense of which ones fit your travel style and your budget			2
@entity14 beaches dot @entity3 's rugged coastline			1
find a secluded beach the @entity17 , southern @entity3 's balmy riviera , sees nothing but blue sky 300 days of the year			1
admire the ocean views from the roof terrace at @entity23 , in the whitewashed old center of @entity25 , just a block from the beach			2
rooms are simple , but all have private terraces , and the price includes a generous breakfast buffet and afternoon cake ( doubles from $ 65 )			2
the most dramatic coastline is along the drive to the medieval fortress town of @entity36			1
( cars can be rented for around $ 30 a day in @entity25 ; book online with companies like @entity39			0
) between @entity41 and @entity42 do @entity43 , the cliffs have been broken by the wind and sea into jagged rock formations pierced by blowholes and grottoes			0
secret half - moon bays of golden sand lie hidden from view from all but the ocean			0
an hour beyond @entity36 is @entity54 's southwesternmost point : @entity56 @entity55 , a cape whose plunging cliffs are dotted with crumbling medieval churches and castles			1
more than 500 years ago , @entity3 sailing ships left to explore the world from these shores			1
there 's great hiking in the fragrant pine woods and peach orchards less than 20 miles inland , around the spa town of @entity69 -- a cluster of tiny houses and 18th - century mansions tumbling down a steep , wooded valley			1
the trail up to the @entity75 peak has magnificent views out over the coast all the way to the cape			0
families from @entity82 take weekends on the beaches of @entity85 , less than 20 miles from the capital			1
there they jostle for space on three broad , short beaches and wander , ice cream in hand , along the ocean esplanade or the clusters of narrow streets crowded around the town 's imposing fort			1
for wilder , lonelier sand , head to @entity98 , four miles west			0
this sweeping , gently curved shoreline is pounded by some of the best surf in the eastern @entity102			0
an almost constant wind makes for superb windsurfing ; a world championship is hosted here most augusts			0
but watch out for those rips and prepare for cold water			0
while the @entity17 is good for swimming from spring to autumn , you 'll need a wet suit around @entity85 for all but the summer months			0
the town is easily reached from @entity82 ; trains leave from @entity114 station every 15 minutes and take just over half an hour ( $ 4.50 round trip )			1
but if you choose to stay , take a room at the @entity117 , a 16th - century manor in a quiet @entity85 backstreet ( doubles from $ 30 )			0
there 's a pocket - size former @entity122 on the hotel grounds			2
@entity124 at opulent chapels and palaces @entity82 spreads in terra - cotta and cobblestone over seven hills , staring out over the @entity130 to the shimmering @entity102			1
a rugged @entity132 castle tops the skyline , and the streets are lined with baroque churches and @entity137 art nouveau buildings			1
@entity138 coach : friends explore @entity82 and beyond allow at least three days for a first visit , and make time for the @entity143			1
extravagantly decorated doorways lead through long cloisters to a church supported by pillars adorned with stone ropes and coils of faux seaweed			0
these rise to a fan - vaulted ceiling whose thousands of tons of stone somehow look light and airy			0
many @entity3 notables are buried at this monastery , including @entity159 , author of @entity3 's national epic , @entity161 , and the explorer @entity163			1
the @entity164 is one of the world 's great small museums			2
oil magnate @entity164 acquired a huge collection of @entity170 , @entity54 and @entity171 artifacts and @entity173 art , which was brought to @entity82 after his death			1
highlights include intricate @entity177 jewelry , opulent @entity132 carpets and tapestries , paintings by @entity181 and @entity182 , and an extensive collection of @entity185 's art nouveau glassware			1
finish your day with a late afternoon 's wander around the narrow , cobbled streets of the @entity190 neighborhood on a cliff overlooking the 18th - century city center			1
there 's a pretty medieval square or a magnificent church at every turn			1
the most beautiful is the @entity197 , whose simple exterior hides what was said at the time to be the most expensive chapel ever built -- a feast of rich gold work and beguilingly complex mosaics of lapus lazuli , ivory , agate , and precious metals			0
built in @entity210 in 1742 , it was blessed by the @entity211 before being transported in its entirety to @entity82			1
it 's an easy day trip from @entity82 to @entity215 , a former royal retreat in cool forested hills near the coast			1
it looks like a @entity221 fantasy : pastel tiered castles crown the hilltops ; faux - @entity132 domed palaces lie hidden in wooded gardens ; and extravagant , neo-gothic mansions loom at the top of steep driveways			1
the grandest of all is the @entity230 , rebuilt by @entity3 's half - mad @entity232 king - consort in the late 18th century ( park and palace admission $ 14 )			1
it 's a fascinating mishmash of @entity240 colonnades , @entity236 / oriental turrets and windows painted in garish pinks and yellows			2
the interior of the building is preserved as it was when royalty fled during the 1910 revolt -- down to the tables set for dinner and the lamp - stand statues of turbaned @entity250 holding light bulbs			0
sample robust wines and fresh fish every small @entity3 town has its own wine , traditional cakes and cheeses			1
in the @entity259 , cheeses are curdled with thistle flowers and washed down with rich , earthy red wines			0
base yourself in @entity264 , a city founded by the @entity177 , expanded by the @entity265 and enriched by the @entity3 kings			1
each group left its monuments ; the cork forests and vineyards around the city are strewn with @entity273 dolmens , for example			0
about 150 miles north , in the mountainous @entity276 region , is the village of @entity278 , famous for its red wines and vanilla - flavored cavaca candies -- invented by nuns from the local convents in the @entity284			0
@entity278 is a delightful maze of winding streets and makes a great base for hiking in the nearby park land , @entity289 , or for visiting the @entity290 , where rock faces are inscribed with @entity293 art. the @entity294 flows out of @entity295 into a deep valley stepped with some of @entity54 's oldest vine terraces			1
port wine comes from here , together with some of @entity3 's heartiest reds			1
the @entity301 is easily seen on a boat cruise from @entity42 , a destination in its own right			0
here stands one of the largest collections of @entity173 buildings in the @entity273			0
every other corner leads to a little baroque church whose modest fa√ßade hides an interior encrusted with tons of gold			2
winding streets in the city 's medieval center lead down the hillside to the river			1
wander along the quays in @entity322 across from @entity42 city and drop in on the various port wine warehouses for free samples			0
it 's a great way to decide what kind to bring home as a gift			2
cap off your day with dinner on the banks of the @entity294 at @entity333			1
the house specialties are bacalhau ( salted cod served steamed or in little deep fried crispy balls ) , followed by pork fillets with clams or hake au gratin with seafood sauce			0
@entity343 is widely spoken , and it 's always more welcome than @entity295 , which might even produce a scowl			2
@entity3 and @entity295 have an age - old rivalry			1
visitors trying to speak a few words of @entity3 will make many friends			2
in the @entity17 , everyone sees the ocean from the beaches			0
but it 's just as much fun seeing the beaches from the ocean			2
book an afternoon boat trip out of @entity358 with one of the numerous agents on the @entity361 and be sure to take a camera to capture the golden afternoon light on the crumbling cliffs			0
@entity3 can be a difficult country for vegetarians			2
even vegetable soup is cooked with meat stock			0
be sure to state clearly that you do n't eat any meat or fish -- even as seasoning			0
for the coolest night out in @entity82 , head to co-owner @entity375 's waterfront warehouse club , @entity376 , which is always packed with the most fashionable crowd on a friday or saturday night			1
@entity82 has some of the liveliest @entity379 music in @entity54 ; terrific @entity380 , @entity381 and @entity383 singers make the city home			1
the hottest acts play at the @entity388 nights at @entity389 ( from $ 20 )			0
for schedules of @entity392 concerts all over @entity82 , e-mail bleza21@gmail.com			2
@entity3 is a great country for driving			2
small distances and an excellent and well - signposted road network mean that it 's never a long journey to the next place of interest			2
and the whole country can be driven from north to south in a little over a day			0
but beware of @entity3 drivers			2
hugging the fender and flashing headlamps furiously on the highway is common practice -- as is reckless passing			0
@entity3 is great for kids			2
@entity82 has a huge aquarium , and the dolphin and seal shows at the @entity411 on the @entity17 are some of the best in @entity54			1
there are swimming pools and restaurants here , so you can stay for the whole day ( adults $ 14 )			0
timing @entity3 is sweltering in the summer ( june through august ) and very busy with @entity54 tourists			1
the spring ( april through may ) and autumn ( september through october ) are cooler , just as sunny and far less busy			0
the winter ( november through march ) is wet and cold			0
