-- as i research my family history , preparing a book about my grandmother @entity4 , " @entity5 , " i occasionally come across holiday pictures of @entity7			2
this was my great - grandfather @entity10 's home in @entity11 , @entity12 , and in the pictures it 's decorated for the @entity15 and @entity16			1
thanks to his invention , the home bursts with light in those pictures ; the radiance is almost palpable			0
all the bulbs were incandescent , of course			0
there was n't any other kind , and candles would have been way too dangerous			0
light and safety , and low cost , were all great features of @entity10 's light bulbs			1
but come january 1 , when a light - bulb law setting new efficiency standards is set to take effect , it 's out with those old incandescents and in with the new			1
my great grandfather 's 100 - watt incandescent will be replaced with new energy - efficient versions , including @entity42 , leds , and -- yes -- new and improved incandescent bulbs			1
when better lighting is fully implemented throughout our country , we 'll be saving $ 13 billion a year in electricity costs and we 'll eliminate the need for 30 large power plants , according to the @entity51 , an environmental advocacy group			0
and my great - grandfather would n't have it any other way			1
for the record , @entity10 was a patriot , he was a futurist , and he was green			2
@entity10 's concern after the turn of the last century was with pollution and nonrenewable resources , not with freezing technological change at the level of 1879			1
he wanted the @entity62 to harness water power in 1911 ; he wanted @entity64 and @entity65 to recognize that oil was nonrenewable but the sun was infinite and free ; he wanted to use goldenrod — a roadside weed — to serve as a cheap and independent source to replace imported foreign rubber			0
he wanted everything that today 's eco-opposition want to undercut with ill - considered political posturing			2
@entity10 would have spurned the recent sleight of hand by @entity77 that leaves the new lighting standard -- under the @entity79 -- on the books but takes away its funding for nine months			1
how can inventor - entrepreneurs like @entity10 make a profit if every time they try to make a technological advance some nut in @entity77 pulls the rug out from under the them and their breakthroughs ? and if investors are going to put their bets on more efficient technology , they have to know that a congressional holiday on common sense will not come along to undercut demand for their product			1
@entity10 would have been the first to support technological advances , that 's the real , obvious message of his 1,000 - plus patents			1
let 's invent the future			0
he would have embraced new tough standards as a way to move our antiquated energy policies forward , helping people save money when they most need it , and reducing carbon pollution that puts our future at risk			0
so where would @entity10 be tonight ? he 'd be in the lab inventing a better light bulb			2
engineers sharing @entity10 's legacy are working on these better bulbs now — and with the advances in chemistry and materials since @entity10 's time — they 're creating better lights and lower costs with more efficiency and far less pollution			1
let 's also not forget that most old incandescent bulbs manufactured today are imports from @entity128			2
you remember them : the same folks who sent @entity132 and @entity133 polluted sheet - rock to rebuild their hurricane - ravaged houses and are using the profits to buy up @entity138 debt			0
domestic sources of light would have been @entity10 's first priority			1
upon his winter visit to the @entity10 winter home in @entity145 , @entity146 , he would have heralded news of unemployed former @entity149 scientists being scooped up by @entity145 's @entity150 to advance initiatives in led technology			2
more jobs would have been another good result of technology in @entity10 's point of view			1
the future of the light bulb is bright			0
you can take that as straight goods from @entity10 's own great - grandchildren			1
drop by my house and enjoy the two lighted deer on my porch roof			0
they are cheap to run			0
to my eye , they are just as bright as the ones in the @entity10 family 's @entity7 home at @entity15 , maybe brighter			2
when @entity10 died in 1931 , the world found that it could not turn off the electricity to honor him for even a minute because it had grown so dependent on electricity in @entity10 's lifetime — they had to settle for just dimming the lights			1
as you turn off your lights december 31 , remember that when you switch on the lights in 2012 they will be brighter and cheaper than ever , and safer			0
and they will also help @entity138 reclaim its place as a leader in technology , invention , and entrepreneurialism			0
let 's do our best in 2012 to help his technological children succeed in doing just that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			0

@entity206 says his great - grandfather , @entity10 , would have liked efficient bulbs
he says new efficiency law to take effect january 1 , was in line with @entity10 's futurism
he says @entity10 would have disdained @entity77 ' recent vote to *defund* law for nine months
@entity4 : @entity218 , green , entrepreneurial advances are @entity195
