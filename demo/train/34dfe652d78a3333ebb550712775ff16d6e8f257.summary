@entity0 , @entity1 -- the venerable @entity3 , often dubbed " @entity3 , " said no tuesday to adding a piece of 1990s history to its collections			1
a day earlier , a @entity1 judge approved an agreement to donate the brownish - green suit @entity10 wore the day in 1995 that he was acquitted of murder -- if museum officials wanted it			1
" the curators feel that it does n't fit with the collections here at the @entity19 , " @entity15 , spokeswoman for the museum , told @entity2 tuesday			0
the museum houses iconic memorabilia , such as a pair of @entity24 's ruby slippers from " @entity25 , " the hat @entity27 wore the night he was assassinated and a piece of a lunch counter from a @entity30 's in @entity31 , @entity32 , that was the site of a civil rights sit - in			0
the museum on the @entity36 in @entity37 is also home of the original " @entity39 , " which inspired poet @entity40 to pen the lyrics to what would become the national anthem			0
the agreement to donate the suit ended a years - long battled between @entity47 , the father of the man the @entity51 star was accused of killing , and @entity53 's former sports agent , @entity54 , who has possession of the suit			1
but no one checked with the @entity3 before making the announcement			1
@entity15 said there was no official offer to donate the suit and that officials learned of the potential deal on the @entity64			0
with the @entity3 's rejection , the parties will look for another museum to take the suit , per the @entity69 on monday			1
" i suggested to go back to @entity72 ( the @entity72 , where @entity53 starred in college football ) , even though they 've distanced themselves , or maybe the @entity77 museum , " said @entity53 's attorney , @entity70 , who said he was disappointed in the @entity3 's decision			1
" we had worked six hours on monday to reach the settlement , and to find the finest museum in @entity81 turning down what is truly a piece of highly controversial litigation in the @entity81 -- it was very disappointing , " he said			0
" of all the museums in the @entity81 , this would be the one most open because it is our national museum , " he said			0
" it deals with the ups and downs of @entity81			0
you do n't see the @entity3 walking away from days of the @entity92 -- which were certainly horrible days in our history -- because it was so horrible			2
so , i thought this would be the museum to house this , even as controversial as it is			0
" @entity53 stood trial on charges of stabbing to death his ex-wife , @entity53 , and @entity47 's son , @entity106 , outside her luxury townhouse in @entity108 on june 12 , 1994			1
the trial lasted more than nine months and ended on october 3 , 1995 , with a jury finding @entity53 not guilty			2
later , the families of @entity112 and @entity47 took @entity53 to civil court to seek damages for wrongful death			2
that jury found @entity53 liable for the deaths and awarded $ 8.5 million in compensatory damages to the @entity120 family and to @entity122 's biological mother			1
since then , @entity47 has been trying to collect the money			0
@entity53 has consistently said he did not kill the two and should not have to pay			2
in 2008 , @entity54 appeared on the " @entity126 " television show , claiming he had the suit and pants @entity53 wore on the day of the acquittal			1
he also said the " acquittal suit " -- as it came to be known -- was worth $ 50,000			0
monday 's decision , said @entity47 , " takes any option out of the killer 's hands or @entity54 's hands to sell it and make money on it			1
" meanwhile , @entity53 , 62 , is serving a nine - year sentence in @entity140 after his conviction on robbery and kidnapping charges in an unrelated case			2
the case involved a botched attempt in september 2007 by @entity53 to retrieve items that he said had been stolen from him by memorabilia dealers			2
