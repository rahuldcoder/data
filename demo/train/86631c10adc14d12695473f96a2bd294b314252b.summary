-- @entity1 has been to @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , 101 times			1
" the @entity6 are unlike anything else on the planet , " he said			1
@entity1 , who runs the @entity6 fan site @entity10 , will be in @entity3 this weekend to celebrate the theme park resort 's 40th birthday			1
since its opening on october 1 , 1971 , @entity2 -- or @entity2 , as it 's often referred to online -- has become the world 's most visited recreational resort			1
it 's also more than twice the size of @entity20 's @entity19 island			2
people get married there , they go there on their honeymoons ( more than anywhere else in the continental @entity26 ) , and of course it 's a major destination for families			2
for those who go over and over again , like @entity1 , there is a big nostalgia factor			0
he counts attractions that no longer exist at the park among his favorites			2
" i think the fascination is partly nostalgia for characters & childhood memories and partly the promise of fun , " the ireporter said			1
" you know when you go to @entity2 , you are going to have fun			2
there are n't many places you can take the family and have that guarantee			2
" for other repeat visitors , like @entity50 , a visit to the resort can mark an important point in their lives			1
" i was newly sober and only had one day to spend at @entity2 while in @entity3 for business [ in 1993 ] , " he said			1
" my first park was @entity59 , and as a result of that visit , i became enamored with everything @entity6			1
i promised myself for each year i stayed sober , i would reward myself with a visit to @entity2			0
" @entity50 eventually moved to @entity3 and started the websites @entity65 and @entity66			1
@entity50 does n't think one thing in particular makes the parks so special			0
like him , many who visit the parks have one special memory they take with them			0
" everyone has a story -- a memory -- that they relive every time they return , " he said			0
" @entity6 is really its own world -- and a place where you can escape from reality without any of the negative consequences that usually come with other forms of escapism			1
" check out more ireports of @entity6 memories @entity87 , another hard - core fan , ireporter and creator of @entity90 , said he remembers specific moments instead of rides or attractions : " sharing a great meal with a great collection of friends , watching my wife 's face light up as she watches fireworks burst overhead , or wandering old stomping grounds with my mom and dad			1
@entity2 is , for me , the magical place that means so much to my friends and family , and they are the heart of my experiences there			2
" just before packing for his 102nd trip to the parks , @entity1 said that he believes @entity2 is " unlike anything else on the planet			1
sure , there are other theme parks , but they are n't even close to @entity2 in popularity , quality , and most certainly in meaning to @entity26 culture			2
" watch an ireporter 's home movie of @entity121 and @entity2 in 1974 for hard - core fans like @entity1 , @entity2 history is something that is discussed on the many websites devoted to the parks			1
here are some important dates in @entity2 history : october 1 , 1971 : nearly five years after the death of @entity6 , the resort bearing his name officially opens in an area that used to be swampland , with @entity136 theme park attractions like " @entity137 , " the @entity138 , the @entity139 and the @entity140			1

) @entity172 at the @entity136 in 1983 may 1 , 1989 : a third park , @entity6 - @entity181 ( which would herald a new spate of filmmaking in @entity3 -- at least for a short time ) opens			1
