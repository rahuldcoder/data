-- the @entity1 warned @entity2 tuesday it faces legal action over controversial reforms introduced by @entity2 prime minister @entity6 's government			1
@entity1 president @entity7 said the move reflects its determination to see that @entity11 law is fully respected			1
" we hoped that the @entity2 authorities would make the changes necessary to guarantee respect of @entity11 law , " he said in a statement			1
" this has not been the case so far , therefore we have decided to begin infringement proceedings			0
" the actions concerns three issues , he said : the independence of the national central bank , the retirement age of judges , and the independence of the country 's data protection authority			1
the commission is also seeking more information in regard to the independence of the judiciary , @entity7 said			2
both the @entity11 and @entity34 have said they will refuse to extend aid to @entity2 , which is struggling financially , unless the government in @entity37 guarantees the independence of the central bank			1

@entity6 is to meet @entity7 in @entity44 , @entity45 , for talks next tuesday , the latter said in his statement			1
" @entity2 is a key member of the @entity50 family , " @entity7 said			2
" we do not want the shadow of doubt on respect for democratic principles and values to remain over the country any longer			0
the quicker that this is resolved , the better			0
" infringement proceedings are a step preceding legal action , intended to enable a state to make changes to conform with @entity11 law rather than be taken to court			1
@entity7 wrote to @entity6 in december requesting the withdrawal of two recent bills related to the country 's financial stability and the central bank			1
the @entity11 then raised the prospect of taking @entity2 to the @entity74 , @entity50 's highest court , over @entity6 's constitutional overhaul			1
the string of constitutional changes introduced by @entity6 's center - right government have generated much controversy within @entity2 , where his party , @entity80 , has a dominant position in @entity83			2
tens of thousands of people protested against the new constitution in @entity37 earlier this month , demanding that @entity6 resign			2
the demonstration , which lasted nearly five hours , was organized by opposition parties and civil society groups who say the new constitution is anti-democratic			2
@entity93 secretary of state @entity92 expressed similar concerns last year , pushing @entity6 to commit to " the independence of the judiciary , a free press , and governmental transparency			0
" the government has defended itself and blamed opposition parties for bringing the country to the brink of economic and political collapse			0
it says it is trying to resolve a problem spawned by the previous @entity106 government			0
the new constitution , which took effect january 1 , omits " republic " from @entity2 's official name , and includes several paragraphs that @entity110 says violate international human rights			2
the human rights organization has been critical of sections that define life as beginning at conception and marriage as being between a man and a woman			0
it also expressed concerns about the possibility of life imprisonment without parole , and the failure to forbid discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation			0
the demonstration earlier this month was preceded by a series of protests in 2011 against laws introduced by @entity2 's populist government			0
critics have said that a new media law is restrictive and that a new electoral law favors @entity6 's party			1
they have also taken aim at a law criminalizing homelessness .			0
