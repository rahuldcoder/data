@entity8 , the speaker of parliament , was sworn in the following day as interim president , and new elections are due within 60 days			2
. what were the protests about ? they were sparked by the suicide of an unemployed college graduate in december			2

tunisians accuse the ruling circle of rampant corruption and nepotism			0
recent diplomatic cables from the @entity38 in @entity2 obtained by @entity39 revealed growing disquiet with the government -- especially over nepotism			1
why does @entity2 matter ? it could be the canary in a coal mine , since it 's far from the only @entity46 nation with a long - time president and a young , underemployed population			1
riots broke out in neighboring @entity50 after weeks of demonstrations in @entity2 , and @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 will certainly be watching closely to see what happens in @entity56			1

with a population of just over 10 million , @entity2 is not one of the major players in the region			1
it 's not an oil exporter , does not have disputes with its neighbors , and is relatively prosperous and liberal for north @entity78			0

popular protests toppled him after a month
