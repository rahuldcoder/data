-- federal intelligence officials are looking at whether more could have been done to prevent the @entity4 attacks , president @entity1 said tuesday , though he added that he 's not aware of any missteps			1
" based on what i can see so far , the @entity6 performed its duties			1
the @entity10 did what it was supposed to be doing , " @entity1 said			1
" but this is hard stuff			0
" the president called the review by the director of national intelligence 's office " standard procedure , " but it comes amid withering criticism from some lawmakers of how well law enforcement , intelligence analysts and the administration handled a 2011 request by @entity24 officials to investigate one of the two bombing suspects , @entity25			1
that year , @entity24 authorities alerted the @entity28 to concerns that @entity25 was becoming increasingly radical			0
the @entity24 also raised questions about @entity25 's mother , @entity31 , according to several sources			2
but the @entity6 found no evidence of extremist activity and closed the case			1
the names of both @entity25 and his mother were placed in a terror database , however			0
still , @entity25 was allowed to travel the next year to a restive @entity24 region rife with @entity41 terror groups , and he returned to the @entity28 after six mysterious months abroad			0
investigators have said they are looking at possible links between @entity25 and those groups during his time in the region			2
information sharing in the days following the attacks , @entity47 sen. @entity47 of @entity48 led criticism of the administration 's handling of the @entity24 reports -- questioning whether intelligence and law enforcement agencies properly shared information that could have prevented the april 15 bombings			2
three people died in the attack and more than 260 were wounded , 20 of whom remained hospitalized tuesday			0
authorities say @entity25 and his younger brother , @entity62 , killed a police officer a few days after the attack			0
photos : galleries from the attack and aftermath " i just find it really unnerving that we could have had him in @entity6 custody in 2011 and did a whole profile of him , and after the attack that his name did not surface , that we did n't check the database or the database had him missing , " @entity47 had said of the older @entity25			1
he continued his criticism tuesday , after @entity1 's remarks , comparing the @entity85 attack with one last year at the @entity28 consulate in @entity87 , @entity88 , which left four @entity28 dead			1
both attacks , he said , suggesting warning signs were ignored and communication among intelligence and law enforcement agencies was flawed			0
@entity1 said the intelligence review into how @entity25 's case was handled , while not prompted by the criticisms , would " leave no stone unturned			1
" " we want to see , is there in fact additional protocols and procedures that could be put in place that would further improve and enhance our ability to detect a potential attack , " he said			0
at the same time , the president rejected @entity47 's criticisms , saying " it 's not as if the @entity6 did nothing			1
" " they not only investigated the older brother , they interviewed the older brother , " the president said			2
" they concluded that there were no signs that he was engaging in extremist activity			0
" criminal investigation @entity25 's body , meanwhile , remained tuesday in the hands of the @entity123			1
his widow , @entity124 , released a statement tuesday evening stating that the medical examiner 's office " is prepared to release " the slain suspect 's remains			1
if and when they do , it wo n't be to @entity132 , the mother of his young child			0
" it is @entity124 's wish that his remains be released to the @entity25 family , and we will communicate her wishes to the proper authorities , " her lawyers said in a statement			1
through her attorneys , @entity132 has denied any knowledge of her husband 's involvement in the bombings			2
she will meet in the coming days with law enforcement , " as she has done for many hours over the past week , and provide as much assistance to the investigation as she can , " the lawyers said			2
the @entity6 took dna samples at her @entity157 home on monday -- the same day law enforcement sources told @entity0 that a woman 's dna had been found on a fragment of one of the pressure cooker bombs used in the bombings			1
the sources cautioned that this does n't necessarily mean a woman might have conspired with brothers			0
and an official said that , even if @entity132 's dna matches that from the bomb fragment , it does n't necessarily mean she participated in the bomb 's construction			1
the dna could also be from a victim , @entity173 , a dna expert at the @entity175 in @entity176 , told @entity0 's @entity178			2
as of tuesday , there was no known match for the dna found on the bomb fragment			1
nor was there a match from at least one fingerprint found in the @entity85 bomb debris , a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation told @entity0 's @entity189			1
very preliminary talks while the elder @entity25 died april 19 after a firefight with police , his 19 - year - old brother @entity62 is being held at a federal @entity196 medical center in @entity197 , @entity198 , on a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction			2
he faces a possible death penalty if convicted			0
bombing suspect @entity204 's new cell on monday , a federal judge appointed prominent defense lawyer @entity206 to represent him			1
@entity207 has represented @entity208 , the @entity209 ; @entity210 , the @entity212 bomber , and @entity213 , who pleaded guilty in the @entity215 , @entity216 , shooting that killed six and left then - @entity28 rep. @entity217 seriously wounded			2
federal prosecutors and the defense team of @entity204 have had some very preliminary talks over the " past few days " to potentially allow the surviving suspect to resume providing information to investigators , possibly in exchange for eliminating the possibility of a death penalty if he is convicted , two government sources told @entity0 on tuesday			1
the communications are in the very early stages , and not a sign lawyers for either side is ready to make a deal , said one source , who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the private discussions			0
the source stressed these are not formal talks -- with a @entity28 @entity241 official saying it would not be accurate to refer to the conversations as negotiations			2
prosecutors have not said they will definitely seek the death penalty in the case , but it is an option under the federal law the 19 - year - old is accused of violating			2
attorney general @entity250 would have the final say			0
these kinds of conversations are not unusual in such high - profile cases , legal sources say			0
@entity24 cooperation , links over the weekend , news emerged that @entity24 authorities had intercepted a phone call in early 2011 from one of the @entity25 brothers in the @entity28 to their mother in @entity264			0
the call included a vague discussion of jihad , an official with knowledge of the investigation told @entity0			1
that information did n't make its way to the @entity6 before the bombings , the official said			1
last week , @entity24 president @entity275 said he had regrets @entity24 intelligence was n't able to provide more information to @entity28 officials before the bombing , and said he hoped the incident would spark greater cooperation between @entity28 and @entity24 counterterrorism officials			1
@entity24 has been " very cooperative with us since the @entity85 bombing , " @entity1 said tuesday			1
" obviously , old habits die hard , " he said			0
" there 's still suspicions sometimes between our intelligence and law enforcement agencies that date back in some cases 10 , 20 , 30 years , to the @entity292			0
" another possible investigative development tied to @entity24 relates to possible links between @entity25 and a @entity298 jihadist killed by @entity24 troops in 2012 , a source being briefed on the investigation said			0
@entity301 and six others died in a firefight with @entity24 forces in the southwestern republic of @entity264 in july 2012 -- while @entity25 was visiting the region , the source said			0
the 23 - year - old @entity301 was born in @entity24 , but his family moved to @entity298 when he was a teenager			0
why did @entity25 go to @entity24 ? @entity25 flew out of @entity264 two days after @entity301 's body was prepared for burial , according to the source			0
investigators are looking into the possibility he left because of @entity301 's death , the source said			1
like @entity25 , @entity301 was once a boxer			0
investigators also are looking into whether @entity25 had any contact with another militant named @entity319 , who was killed by @entity24 forces in may 2012 during a gun battle in @entity264 's capital , the source said			2
