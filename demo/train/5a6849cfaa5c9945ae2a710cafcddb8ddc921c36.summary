@entity1 , @entity2 this state launched the @entity5 brand two decades ago and handed @entity6 one of the biggest victories of her 2008 primary battle against @entity10			1
but as she considers another bid for the @entity13 in 2016 , @entity2 is n't so friendly			1
in the final weeks of the 2014 election , top @entity14 in @entity2 told @entity6 and her associates that she was n't welcome to stump for the party 's candidates in the state , according to a knowledgeable source			1
while there were some in @entity2 who wanted her to come , the " stay away " contingent won the argument and @entity6 was left to raise money for sen. @entity25 from @entity26			1
@entity5 made up for the absence , making 13 stops in the state during campaign season imploring voters to not make the election a repudiation of president @entity10			1
still , democrats across @entity2 lost big			2
the governor 's mansion flipped red , along with @entity25 's @entity37 seat			2
the state 's four - member @entity13 delegation is solidly @entity40			0
the rout was part of a broader repudiation of @entity14 across the @entity44 this election cycle			1
but the results in @entity2 were particularly tough for the @entity47 and raise questions about whether the state most associated with the couple is no longer welcome territory ahead of @entity6 's potential 2016 race			1
" the coattails were short , " outgoing @entity14 gov. @entity53 told @entity3			0
" it is a fact			0
" @entity5 handily won @entity2 during both of his presidential elections			1
but the politics of the @entity44 changed during his time in office as many states were increasingly dominated by @entity40			2
@entity2 was a genuine battleground state during the 2000 election , when @entity62 and @entity65 both campaigned here and spent money on television ads. seeking to distance himself from @entity5 after his impeachment , @entity62 did n't campaign with the former president and lost @entity2 to @entity65 by 5 points			1
by 2008 , @entity2 was seen as so unfriendly to @entity14 that @entity10 wrote the state off -- even as he won other southern states like @entity74 and @entity75 that @entity40 carried for decades			2
before the 2014 election , @entity6 's supporters -- many at the grassroots level in @entity2 -- would quietly talk about the former first lady 's chances of competing and winning @entity2 in 2016			1
they touted her standing with white women and working class voters			0
but after @entity85 , those optimistic democrats are harder to find			0
" limited , " said @entity86 , the chair of the @entity88 , when asked about @entity6 's chances of winning the state			1
" it is limited here in @entity2			2
" " i think she could run a strong race here , but i think the electorate has changed , " said @entity93 , a newly elected democratic state representative			0
" the state has changed			0
" @entity6 moved to @entity2 in 1974 , joining her soon - to - be husband , @entity100 , who was already a rising political star in the state			1
the couple would go on to dominate the state 's politics for the better part of two decades and left a long list of confidants -- known as @entity109 or @entity110 -- in key @entity14 positions across the state			0
@entity40 power bases in northwest @entity2 have grown , religious conservatives are a powerful voting bloc and the state 's @entity117 population has yet to become a force at the ballot box			1
" @entity2 is a real demographic nightmare for @entity14 , " said @entity121 , the vice chair of political science at the @entity123			1
" it is a complete reversal of fortunes			0
" all of this complicates the idea that @entity6 could win @entity2 in 2016			1
during the 2008 primary , @entity6 dominated @entity10 , winning 70 % of the state , her largest victory during that year 's primary fight			1
that was the only time she has been on the ballot in the state , however , and was a contest with just @entity14 voters			0
the 2014 exit polls in @entity2 were n't positive for @entity6 , either			1
thirty - nine percent of voters said she would make a good president , according to the exit polls			0
fifty - six percent said she would not			0
those same exit polls found that former @entity40 @entity2 gov. @entity142 , who is also considering a 2016 run , is seen as a better presidential option in the state than @entity6			1
fifty percent of voters in @entity2 said he would be a good president , compared to 46 % who said he would n't			1
with the former first lady eyeing another run at the presidency in 2016 , @entity14 and @entity2 experts said that while she would easily win the @entity14 primary , she would struggle mightily to overcome what has become a changed state			2
@entity14 in @entity2 blame @entity10 -- not the @entity47 -- for their losses			2
one reason @entity53 , the outgoing governor , sees things getting better for @entity14 in 2016 and beyond is because " @entity10 will be gone			0
" " i think it is all @entity10 , " @entity53 said			0
" i do n't think there is any question that most folks feel like it was a repudiation of the president and the president 's policies			2
but i think it is cyclical and the reason i say that is if you look at the history			0
" " democrats are looking at what can she do different from @entity10 , " said @entity121			0
" if you are a @entity14 activist , you would end up hoping she would win white women			0
... that idea that a woman candidate could end up running and making the gap grow is not going to happen			0
" exit polls show that @entity53 is partly right : nearly 70 % of voters in @entity2 said they disapprove of @entity10			2
only 30 % said they were satisfied with him			0
for @entity184 , 2016 -- and a @entity6 run - is a moment to rebuild			2
" i would hope that she would carry @entity2 , " he said , rejecting the idea that democrats are done in the state			2
" but if she runs it is so , so positive for us on the local level , here , for what we can do with her popularity			0
" as for whether the @entity5 magic is gone in @entity2 , @entity184 deferred his answer for two years			1
" i guess , " he said , " we will see what happens in 2016 , wo n't we ? "			0

@entity6 is the former first lady of @entity2
but @entity2 might not be friendly to @entity5 if she runs for president
@entity5 's *challenge* *reflects* broader political changes in the @entity44
