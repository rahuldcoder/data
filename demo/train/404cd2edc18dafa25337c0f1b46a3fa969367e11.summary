we may all feel like we 're under a cloud from time to time , but in hot and dry climates having your own personal misting cloud is as uplifting as it can get			1
in @entity14 , the @entity10 mega-city situated in one of the hottest parts of the world , the benefits of evaporative cooling have long been known			1
neighboring @entity15 is already one of the world 's largest dairy producers and its massive indoor herds are kept at an even 21 and 23 degrees @entity21 with gigantic misters			0
now one group of designers is reinventing the technology for human beings , devising a system that uses motion tracking and ceiling - mounted misters to provide each pedestrian with their own cooling spray			1
ultrasonic sensors embedded in the canopy structure recognize visitors and send data to a control system that activates hydro - pumps and led lights in their proximity			1
" if you create a more responsive climate around people , you can save a lot of energy by creating just a bubble of heat or a bubble of cool in which they can travel , " professor @entity41 , the head of the team at @entity43 from @entity44 , @entity45 , that developed the @entity48 technology , told @entity1			0
" if you use a system like this it allows people to use more outdoor spaces			0
this is very important in a city like @entity14 which is so hot that people really ca n't spend much time outdoors			2
" @entity69 works by creating mobile responsive clouds that follow people as they move under a canopy			2
an array of responsive nebulizers is guided by sophisticated motion sensing , creating a personal climate for each person that walks under it			2
" it 's something that people have been using for centuries , it 's called evaporative cooling , " @entity41 said			0
" people in this part of the world have been using water to freshen the air for a long time			0
" @entity14 - with its vast shopping malls and indoor leisure centers -- is currently one of the world 's biggest consumers of power for air - conditioning			1
according to the @entity98 ( @entity99 ) , the emirate is among the largest consumers of energy per capita in the world			0
an estimated two - thirds of that in the summer months is burned on driving air - conditioning			1
outside temperatures might reach 50 degrees @entity21 , ( 122 degrees @entity107 ) but inside its public buildings the temperature can be so low that people wear jackets			0
at some cinemas , customers can even rent blankets			0
energy consumption solely for air - conditioning is now one of the region 's looming headaches			1
according to @entity120 , neighboring @entity15 could actually be consuming more oil than it exports in 15 years due largely to air conditioning			2
the @entity123 is experimenting with many traditional solutions to air - conditioning , including wind towers that funnel upper currents of cool air down into houses			1
the most elegant examples of these wind towers still stand in @entity14 's historic quarter of @entity133 -- known locally as @entity134 -- where @entity136 traders created ornate structures in the 1850s to cool and ventilate their urban mansions			1
often , the towers were wrapped in wet fabric to increase their cooling ability			2
the towers also did more than simply cool the air -- the creation of positive pressure inside the building automatically creates a negative pressure on the outside , which means that stale and bad air inside the building is drawn away			2
while air - conditioning might provide immediate thermal comfort , wind towers rid buildings of the constant build - up of @entity157 and reduce stuffiness			1
contemporary variants of wind towers in the @entity123 have achieved a temperature reductions of as much as 12 degrees in buildings			1
@entity41 , however , says the beauty of their cloud cast system is that it is responsive to people			0
" it can cope with as many people as you want -- whether it 's a crowd of people or whether there 's just one , there will be a misting spray , " he said			0
" it 's also highly efficient because you 're not misting a whole space -- you are just cooling a small volume around the person			0
" the @entity48 is currently at the prototype stage and is debuting at the @entity181 in @entity14 this month , but @entity41 believes the evaporative cooler could become popular anywhere there 's a hot climate			1
" we think we 'll have some ready for commercial sale in the near future , " @entity41 said			0
" hot and arid climates are perfect for evaporative cooling			2
" read more from @entity190 , @entity191 : will you soon be able to ' swallow the doctor ' ? meet the world 's first 1,000 mph car out of juice ? try a cardboard battery			0
