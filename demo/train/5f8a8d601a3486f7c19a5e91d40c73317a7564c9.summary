-- i grew up under the impression that i was the best trick - or - treater in the whole wide world , because my grandmother invented it ! the whole thing was her idea ! my grandmother and her friend @entity11 started it way back when she was born in the early 1500s			1
i thought @entity11 must be a pretty cool lady if she was hanging out with my grandmother			1
occasionally i 'll ask people if they know about @entity11 , and sometimes they do n't			2
but if i then mention the little orange trick - or - treat boxes on @entity17 , suddenly everyone knows @entity11			1
we grew up carrying those @entity19 for @entity11 boxes on @entity17 night , and now our kids do			2
these days , the candy bags may be fancier than pillowcases , and the costumes may come from the store , but the orange boxes remain the same			0
in 1950 when @entity19 for @entity11 began , kids simply decorated old milk cartons to collect change			1
the idea was as simple then as it is today : on @entity17 , besides asking for candy , why not also ask for @entity11 donations ? nothing that might sting , nothing big -- just the pennies , nickels , dimes and quarters that normally languish behind the couch , in old winter coats , on the floor of the car , or in the good ole spare - change - bowl - by - the - door			1
the money that falls through the cracks -- so @entity46 kids may raise a little money for their peers who are suffering , far away from costumes and candy			0
since @entity17 1950 , that " simple plan , " that " nothing big , " has raised more than $ 144 million for @entity11			2
that 's $ 144 million in pennies , nickels , dimes and quarters ! for many kids who are threatened by disease , natural disasters and war in places like @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and too many other developing countries , this spare change has meant the difference between thriving and merely surviving , health and illness , even life and death			1
in fact , the $ 144 million in small change has contributed to some remarkable news : about 50 years ago , the number of children who died every day from preventable causes before their fifth birthday was more than 50,000			1
three years ago , that number was 25,500			0
despite a recession , despite the continuing effects of a global food crisis , despite other seemingly unbeatable odds , that number has now dropped to 24,000			0
trick - or - treaters like you and me , your kids and mine , and members of civic groups like @entity91 , can feel some pride that we have helped make this happen			1
but the appalling fact remains : 24,000 children die every day from preventable causes like hunger , measles , pneumonia and tetanus			2
the vaccines , medicines and technologies that can prevent and treat such illnesses already exist			0
not one child should die from these illnesses in the year 2009			0
it 's projected that @entity46 will spend about $ 4.75 billion on @entity17 this year , buying everything from candy and costumes , smoke machines and life - size inflatable lawn ornaments			2
but i bet that this year , like last year and many years prior , there 's still change behind that couch and in those old coats			0
we need that simple plan : a " nothing big " again this year			0
not only to help those children , but to teach our own kids			0
we can get 24,000 down to zero			0
and we can show our kids that they can make a difference ; that every penny counts , that they can save a child and change the world			0
so they 'll carry the boxes now , you and i can fill the bowl by the door to the brim and be ready , and this year trick - or - treat for @entity11 can make that change			1
it turns out that although my grandmother did establish the @entity139 , and was president for over 25 years , and while she was a great lady , she did not , in fact , invent @entity17			1
or trick - or - treating			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity146 .			0

@entity146 *suggests* that trick - or - treaters ask for @entity11 donations along with candy
*actress* urges readers to gather up their spare change for a worthy cause
small donations help keep children from dying of hunger and disease
@entity146 's grandmother established the @entity139 and was its president
