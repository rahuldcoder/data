-- @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity2 that when he first got into show business , he had " no eyes to be a performer			1
i had no ambition to be on the stage singing , singing and dancing around the stage			0
" @entity1 , who has sold over 80 million records worldwide , had 35 consecutive top 40 hits and five albums simultaneously on the charts , is the guest on thursday 's " @entity16			1
" the show was taped before a rare in - studio audience , and the renowned singer - songwriter played the piano and sang some of his hits			0
" when i got up there to promote my first album , " said @entity1 , " i really did n't know what to do with my legs			1
i was able to get up from the piano , and then i really did n't know what else to do , because i had never , ever thought about standing up on a stage and entertaining			0
and , i thought i was dreadful			0
but the audiences did n't			0
and i think they were able to connect with a guy who was telling the truth			0
" @entity1 recalled that his first real shot at the spotlight was given to him by @entity35 in the early 1970s			1
" i was her conductor and arranger , " said @entity1			1
" and i had an album out			0
and she allowed me to do a couple of songs			0
" during the 1960s and 1970s , @entity1 worked as a commercial jingle writer			1
he composed the songs for @entity45 ( " and like a good neighbor , @entity45 is there ... " ) , @entity46 ( " i am stuck on @entity46 , ' cause @entity46 's stick on me ! " ) and @entity47 's ( " you deserve a break today " ) among others			1
@entity1 pointed out that the @entity45 and @entity46 jingles still air to this day			1
the @entity56 - born - and - raised @entity1 recalled that on the day he was presented with his first $ 1 million check , which he calls " the ' @entity58 , " he had actually bounced a check he 'd written out to @entity60 that same morning			1
" @entity62 , " which was recorded in 1974 , was @entity1 's first no. 1 hit			1
" i used it as a bookmark , " said @entity1			1
" i mean , that 's where i was at , you know			2
i did n't take money seriously			0
i was never doing it for the money			0
" @entity1 also recounted the lashing he got from critics who bashed " @entity62 , " despite the song 's success on the charts			1
" i 've got my feelings on my sleeve , " said @entity1			1
" i 've made a career out of it , you know ? this is who i am , this is what i feel and i think that was one of the reasons i had such trouble with the critics			2
they did n't like to see that from a guy			0
they 'd much rather see a guy being angry on the stage			0
" @entity1 's first album of original songs in more than a decade , " @entity99 , " is out			1
the singer - songwriter has been the resident headliner at the @entity102 in @entity103 for two years ; prior to that he headlined at the @entity105 for five years			0
now in his seventh year in @entity103 , @entity1 may soon beat @entity107 's record of @entity103 longevity			1
the album name is a nod to the expression coined by artist @entity112 in 1968 : " in the future , everyone will be world - famous for 15 minutes			0
" @entity1 , who has been world - famous for nearly 40 years , told @entity2 that the rewards of fame depend on how it is handled			1
@entity1 said that he fears for people who become famous on shows such as " @entity121 " and " @entity122 " without having paid their dues			2
" they do have talent , " @entity1 said			2
" but , you know , before you know it , they are household names			0
and they have n't worked in the bars that we worked in			0
they have n't played the bar mitzvah , they have n't gotten dressed in the men 's room			2
" however , @entity1 pointed out there 's a dark side to fame today and that stars often pay a price that he did n't have to pay			1
in particular , he referenced @entity143 ' psychological issues and troubles with paparazzi and said , " i do n't know whether anybody brings that kind of thing on themselves			0
it seems to me that she was trying to live her life			0
" this did n't happen to me			0
they did n't follow me around wherever i was going			0
" he said he worries about young celebrities today because " just being famous is a very dangerous thing to do if you are not grounded			0
" @entity1 also pointed out that celebrities today open their private lives to the public via @entity159 , @entity160 and reality shows , saying " they invite people in , you know			1
for me , that 's one place i lock the door unless i invite you in			2
it 's my one thing that i finally have to myself , man			2
which is my life and you ca n't come in unless i invite you in			0
" @entity2 told @entity1 that he agrees that " we know too much " about famous people 's lives , and that he finds the musician more interesting because he keeps his private life private , invoking " the old mystique from celebrity			1
" @entity1 recalled coming up in " that world of @entity180 's " where " we did n't see then what we do see now			1
" i 'm a private man , and i 'm a gentleman , " said @entity1			1
" and i 'm proud of it			1
" when @entity2 asked @entity1 to tell the now - famous story of how @entity185 publicly came to his defense , @entity1 said , " he said some really great things when i was out at dinner and he gave me a real compliment			2
he said , ' keep doing what you 're doing , man			2
' and those were the years that i really needed to hear that			0
" what 's @entity1 's favorite @entity1 song ? " there 's so many songs , " @entity1 said			1
" there 's been 30 years of music , but ' @entity202 ' comes to mind			2
" @entity1 said the song remains an inspiration to him because the words and music came to him in a dream one night			2
he would n't disclose his least favorite @entity1 song			2
how did @entity1 feel about being " the greatest showman of our generation " by @entity211 magazine ? " that 's really a beautiful thing to go through my life with , because i work real hard on that stage			1
i try to do the best work i can			0
