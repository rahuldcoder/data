@entity0 -- lenient enforcement of a law requiring @entity5 citizens to have passports when re-entering the country at land border crossings has heightened the risk that an imposter might get in , according to a government report released monday			1
under the law , which took effect in june 2009 , @entity5 citizens must show passports or some other authorized travel documents like a military @entity16 when returning to the @entity5			1
those who do n't are supposed to undergo further screening to confirm their citizenship			0
but , during a phase - in period that now has stretched over 18 months , very few travelers have been referred to secondary screening , the report from the @entity22 's inspector general 's office found			0
that assertion -- the study concluded -- " increases the risk that someone could enter the @entity5 under false pretense of citizenship			2
" the federal @entity32 , though , contends that the program is working , adding that it believes it is better to encourage compliance gradually then to enforce it right away			0
the inspector general 's report is one of the first to look at compliance with the new passport law , which is known as the @entity41			1
the law impacts all @entity5 , @entity43 and @entity44 citizens , who previously were able to enter the @entity5 at checkpoints along the @entity43 and @entity48 borders without passports			1
on a typical day , some 700,000 people arrive at @entity5 land borders , trying to get into the country			1
but every day , authorities say , some 4 percent -- or 28,000 people -- do not have the required documents			1
in an effort to implement the law without clogging international borders , @entity32 instituted a phase that it called " informed compliance " to transition the law into effect over time			2
it sought compliance through a carrot - and - stick approach , by promising the benefit of speedier travel and punishment of secondary screening and travel delays			0
the results have been mixed			0
compliance has been greatest along the northern border , where 98 percent of travelers had the appropriate documents , the inspector general 's report says			1
along the southern border , compliance has been spottier , with an average of 93 percent of travelers having required documents			1
compliance is lowest at @entity83 border crossings , where 91 percent of travelers had everything they needed			0
the report suggests that the threat of slower travel has not led to higher compliance , noting that compliance rates have leveled off over time			1
the inspector general says the non-compliance rate could spell trouble when @entity32 seeks " full compliance " with the law , saying the latter agency does not have the resources to process large numbers of non-compliant travelers through secondary screening			2
as an example , it said the workload among secondary inspectors at the @entity106 , @entity83 , border crossing could increase 125 percent with " full compliance " of the law			2
as the @entity109 crossing in @entity110 -- the busiest land border crossing in the @entity5 -- officials have only eight computer workstations at which to process an estimated 1,834 secondary inspections per day			2
" processing this number of travelers with these few computer workstations may cause considerable traveler delays , " the report says			0
in a letter to the inspector general , @entity32 officials took issue with the statement that the passport law 's full benefits will not be felt until the final " full enforcement " phase takes effect			1
the agency said the program is working , adding that it believes it is better to encourage compliance then to enforce it at this time			0
" travelers are never admitted until identity , citizenship and admissibility are established to the satisfaction of the inspecting officer , " the agency said			0
" in the event that a traveler does not possess a ( passport or other authorized document ) , the inspecting officer will use all available documentary and system information , as well as oral questioning and inspection techniques , to establish identity and citizenship			0

a *homeland* security *department* @entity150 report looks at enforcement of a new passport law
the study finds that many people get in the @entity5 , by land , without required documents
compliance rates are much higher along the @entity43 border than the @entity48 one
the border *patrol* agency says its phased - in compliance effort is working
