-- state and federal investigations are underway in the case of lane closures that clogged traffic on the @entity6 in @entity7 in august			1
politicians and pundits are tossing around accusations of wrongdoing by employees of the @entity14 - @entity7 @entity13 and the office of @entity7 gov. @entity16			2
the national press may feast on the political implications for @entity7 's @entity20 governor , but i think the episode is symptomatic of a larger , more troubling issue			1
the deliberate political action resulted in life - threatening situations and delays that cost more than $ 21 million of economic losses to businesses and families			2
but the same situation faces millions of @entity31 every day because of the deterioration of our nation 's infrastructure and political gridlock			1
the @entity6 is emblematic of thousands of other bridges nationwide -- it suffers from chronic traffic jams , has a long maintenance backlog and is showing signs of aging that you 'd expect in an 83 - year - old superstructure			0
and while the bridge is undergoing an eight - year , billion - dollar renovation , it remains the busiest bridge in the world			2
it is a major connector of commercial industry and human capital in the @entity51 that will require upkeep for decades to come			0
in other words , the @entity6 's condition is mirrored by other bridges coast to coast			0
@entity31 bridges are in bad shape , and there is a dire need for massive funding to shore them up or rebuild them			0
as we know from major bridge collapses in @entity66 in 2007 and in @entity67 in may 2013 , we 're seeing more and more that merely driving across some bridges might mean that you are putting yourself at risk			0
rather than focusing only on the question of whether certain @entity7 politicians can " survive " the unfolding political scandal , we need to ask whether millions of @entity31 who cross the nation 's bridges every day are going to survive their trips			1
we need to question why political battles at the congressional level have gummed up the funding for improving @entity31 's bridges			2
this is a slow - motion scandal with far - ranging implications			0
why is political gamesmanship stopping the critical investment in our country 's future that labor , the @entity89 and the @entity31 public overwhelmingly support ? this political gridlock is about national elected officials from both sides of the aisle who -- over the span of several presidential administrations -- have failed to make the upkeep and revitalization of our bridges a top priority			1
the condition of @entity31 bridges and our national infrastructure -- roads , sewers , manufacturing and energy facilities -- should be inseparable from the debate over how to end our economic malaise			0
the troubling state of our bridges , in particular , is a premium example of how political priorities have created gridlock that impact millions of @entity31 every day			0
by ending political gridlock that is in the way of funding for major infrastructure projects , jobs can be created , lives can be saved and the future of transportation and commerce will be secured			2
instead , bridges continue to decay and desperately needed maintenance projects are still dangerously backlogged			0
consider this : -- the @entity31 , including @entity130 , is home to more than 66,700 structurally deficient bridges and 84,748 functionally obsolete bridges , the @entity129 reports			0
-- last year , the @entity134 rated one out of nine @entity31 bridges as structurally deficient , and also found that the average age of the nation 's 607,380 bridges is 42 years			1
as a journeyman iron worker and representative of more than 100,000 workers -- including thousands of bridge workers -- i read about the @entity6 - related political squabbling taking place now in @entity7 and interpret it differently			1
as i see it , the real scandal here is in the question of how a critically vital piece of @entity31 's infrastructure -- the bridges that are our lifelines to jobs , hospitals and economic development -- have been neglected for so long			1
where is the outrage over the political gamesmanship at the congressional level that has caused desperately needed work on @entity31 bridges to grind to a halt ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			1

@entity169 says the attention focused on @entity7 's bridge scandal is *misplaced*
@entity167 : our nation 's bridge 's are in dire need of repair
@entity167 : political gamesmanship may lead to *disaster* with our infrastructure
