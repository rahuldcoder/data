@entity0 -- every day that @entity3 opens his @entity0 liquor store , he believes it may be his last			1
it 's a fear that began months ago for 45 - year - old @entity7 , when insurgents began bombing primarily minority - owned liquor stores in the @entity11 capital after officials rescinded a law banning the sale of alcohol			1
but in recent weeks as the attacks have mounted in both scope and ferocity , so , too , has @entity7 's fear			2
it 's not clear who is attacking the stores , though the reasons invoked by stores owners , authorities and lawmakers are as varied as the problems facing @entity11 : from political to social , from religious to secular			1
" it 's the most dangerous job to have a liquor store in @entity0 because there are many groups against this kind of business , either within the government or outside it , " said @entity7 , a @entity29 minority that has been a target of insurgents in recent years			1
@entity39 knows @entity7 's fear			0
he , too , owns a liquor store in central @entity0 that sits a short distance from a police checkpoint			2
" it 's painful to see this happening to our country , " said 46 - year - old @entity39 , a @entity43			0
" all @entity11 used to live together , and it did n't matter who was @entity49 or who was @entity51 , who was @entity53 or who was @entity43			2
" @entity39 believes the attacks are not really about liquor stores so much as it is about a struggle to balance a fledgling democracy with a conservative religious tradition			1
" it 's about the new democracy that @entity63 promised us , " he said			0
under @entity67 tradition , muslims do not drink alcohol			0
but in many parts of @entity0 , it is not uncommon to see people drinking alcohol at outdoor cafes and restaurants			0
within months of the 2003 @entity63 - led invasion that toppled @entity76 , liquor stores in @entity0 and elsewhere were bombed and shot up			1
store owners blamed the attacks on @entity80 or @entity51 militias , such as radical cleric @entity84 's @entity83 army			1
despite the attacks , the number of liquor stores and nightclubs in @entity0 flourished			1
but elsewhere , outright bans or laws aimed at curbing the availability of alcohol were put in place or enforced in primarily conservative @entity51 communities			0
last year , with a shiite - majority government , local officials in @entity0 reintroduced a @entity76 - era law that banned @entity53 from selling alcohol and required anyone selling alcohol to have a liquor license -- essentially banning the sale of alcohol			0
at the time , officials said the crackdown was aimed at regulating alcohol sales , much like other countries			0
but in january the head of the @entity110 , @entity108 told the @entity111 , " we are a @entity53 country , and everyone must respect that			0
" during the same period , @entity84 -- an ally of prime minister @entity116 's @entity51 - dominated government -- railed against liquor stores and nightclubs , going so far as to issue a fatwa , a religious opinion , asking his followers to support the ban and stand against those who want to be " immoral like the @entity123			1
" but when tens of thousands of demonstrators , inspired by popular uprisings in @entity127 and @entity128 , took to the streets across @entity11 to protest corruption and lack of personal freedoms , @entity0 officials rolled back the law			2
within weeks , attacks began against liquor stores			1
since march , at least 25 stores in @entity0 have been bombed , an interior ministry official told @entity1			2
the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media			0
most of the liquor stores targeted were owned by @entity43 or @entity29 , the official said			1
religious minorities , such as @entity43 and @entity29 , make up less than five percent of @entity11 's population , according to the @entity147 high commissioner for refugees			1
since 2003 , attacks against these minorities by insurgents and religious extremists have driven more than half of these minorities out of the country , according to @entity156 statistics			0
@entity29 , among @entity11 's smallest minorities , are of @entity159 descent , and their religion is considered a @entity162 sect that draws from @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166			1
on a recent day , a liquor store owner swept up debris left after a roadside bomb planted outside his store exploded			1
the owner , who would only identify himself as @entity173 , said he was hopeful when @entity11 's @entity174 granted him a license that allowed him to reopen his store after the law was rescinded			1
but two weeks later , his store was bombed during the daily overnight curfew in @entity0			0
it 's a time , @entity173 says , when only @entity11 security forces are supposed to be on the streets			2
" if the @entity11 army and police can not stop such simple attacks , then what is the point of a curfew ? " said @entity173 , a @entity29			2
@entity173 , 28 , said he was considering closing his store and leaving @entity0 for the @entity159 north , an area he considered safer than the @entity11 capital			2
" i 'm telling you , there is no safe place in @entity0 , " he said , " and i 'm thinking i will have to leave			0
" he stopped sweeping and stared silently at the cars driving past his damaged store			0
then he shuffled back inside to continue cleaning			0
@entity1 's @entity197 reported from @entity0 ; @entity198 from @entity199			0

@entity11 officials says 25 liquor stores have been bombed
most of the stores are owned by @entity11 minorities , officials say
it 's not clear who is *responsible* for the attacks
store owner : " it 's not about liquor stores . it 's about the new democracy "
