-- when it comes to negotiating with the @entity3 , it 's always one step forward , two steps back			1
despite several serious rounds of violence this week , including the assassination of a top peace negotiator , the @entity6 will continue to try to negotiate with the @entity3 , experts say			1
@entity11 has been violent for a long time , they argue			2
this week just brought more of the same			0
" [ the @entity6 ] has been fighting for nearly 11 years , and we 've already said we 're not leaving until 2014 , " said @entity12 , a @entity13 and @entity15 professor who has worked in and studied the region for years			2
" talking is not only our best option , it 's our only option , " she said			0
" we should expect that it will be accompanied by violence			0
" the peace process has come in fits and bursts over the past year			1
when former defense secretary @entity26 announced last june that the @entity6 was in preliminary talks with the @entity3 in @entity11 , the idea was controversial			1
many observers were skeptical that the @entity3 would ever deal			1
since then , the concept of negotiations has become more and more the norm			0
president @entity32 touted it in his recent surprise visit to @entity11 on the one - year anniversary of the killing of @entity37			2
yet months into the talks , it 's murky as to who is involved and what , exactly , each party wants			0
in march , the @entity3 said it would not be setting up a diplomatic office in @entity44 to negotiate with @entity6 , blaming their decision on the @entity6 ' " alternating and ever - changing position " on @entity11			1
at the time , preliminary talks with what the @entity3 called " the occupying enemy " had already begun over the exchange of prisoners , the group said			2
assassinated on the way to work observers remind that the peace process is still relatively new considering the protracted war , and all new and difficult enterprises have bumps in the road			1
in @entity11 , that cliche is relative			0
there " were n't great hopes right now for peace talks at the moment in any case , " said @entity62 , a senior fellow at the @entity63 who specializes in defense and foreign policy			0
on sunday , @entity3 interlocutor @entity72 was killed when a gunman drove up to his car while @entity72 was stuck in traffic on his way to work in @entity77			2
he was a member of the @entity78 , which was created by president @entity79 and heartily endorsed by the @entity80			0
the @entity78 is tasked with reaching out to insurgents and ex-taliban who live in @entity77 under government protection			0
@entity72 was considered a moderate @entity3 , someone who could bring other @entity3 members to the negotiating table			1
the @entity3 announced recently that peace council members would be targets of its spring offensive , but a @entity3 spokesman said sunday that the group did not kill @entity72			2
regardless , his death marked the second such high - level negotiator to be killed since last fall when @entity78 chairman @entity94 , a former @entity11 president , was killed in a suicide bombing			1
the biggest danger @entity72 's assassination might have , @entity62 said , would be to scare future @entity3 defectors from talking with the @entity99 and allies , he said			2
@entity101 , the former foreign secretary of @entity102 , agrees			0
" these things are unfortunate but can be expected , " he said			0
" on the more positive side , i do n't think recent violence suggests a strength in the @entity3 forces			2
i think we 'll come understand what is happening in @entity11 as reflective of their weakness			0
it gives the @entity11 people a chance also to show that they wo n't be beaten down			1
it gives them a chance to stick with peace talks			0
" more " green on blue " killings violence this week went beyond @entity72 's death			1
a blast at a crowded market in northern @entity11 killed nine civilians on monday			2
two more @entity126 troops were also killed over the weekend , bringing the total @entity126 death toll to eight in just a few days time			1
the two troops killed sunday are believed to be victims of so - called " green on blue " attacks in which @entity11 security forces turn on their fellow soldiers			1
distrust between allied soldiers and @entity11 soldiers appears to be at an all - time high			2
this year 's string of scandals -- the @entity139 burnings at @entity140 , photos of @entity6 soldiers posing with body parts of alleged insurgents and crimes such as the @entity147 massacre -- has seriously frayed relations among the soldiers who must work side - by - side			1
an experienced @entity102 ambassador to @entity152 , the @entity153 , @entity154 and other countries , @entity101 suspects the recent violence could actually help rally the @entity11 army			0
" if the @entity6 chooses to hold back and continue giving control to @entity11 soldiers , as it appears to be doing , i see this [ positively ]			1
if they pull back and act on suspicion and fear , then it wo n't turn out well for anyone , " he said			1
at least 23 individuals wearing an @entity11 army or police uniform have shot and killed a @entity126 - affiliated soldier this year , according to the @entity80			1
it 's unclear whether some who have attacked @entity126 soldiers are actually @entity11 soldiers or just in disguise			1
handing over more territory meanwhile , the @entity3 has demonstrated that it has plenty of fight			0
the earlier allied surge in the country , especially southern @entity11 , appeared to force the @entity3 to adopt new tactics such as relying on roadside bombs and suicide attacks			1
in the past year , insurgent attacks overall have decreased some 22 % , and in some parts of southern @entity11 by much more , according to coalition figures			0
civilian casualties rose to their highest level last year since 2001 , @entity0 reported			0
by the middle of this week , officials announced that another large swathe of @entity11 territory would be handed over to local authorities , giving them control of about 75 % of the country			2
among the most striking areas that would fall under @entity11 control is the city of @entity147 , a former @entity3 stronghold , and several mountainous areas of @entity11 , which make for excellent hiding places for insurgents			1
2014 is an election year for @entity11			0
results could drastically change the atmosphere for peace talks , @entity12 said			0
on sunday , @entity32 and other world leaders gather at the @entity126 summit in @entity205 , where the future of @entity11 will be the no. 1 topic			1
the meeting will include @entity79 , @entity126 allies and @entity211 contributors , among others			0
the @entity11 constitution prohibits @entity79 from running another term			0
there have n't been any candidates who 've emerged as viable to take his place so far , much less any that have appeared to align their platforms with @entity222 goals .			0

a man thought to be able to bring @entity3 to the negotiating table was killed this week
observers say his death , and killings of @entity126 soldiers , wo n't derail peace process
the @entity6 has said it 's negotiating with the @entity3 to bring peace to @entity11
