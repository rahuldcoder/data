@entity0 , @entity1 -- as bus no. 37 pulled up at the @entity5 stop near his office , @entity3 watched the line of waiting passengers quickly dissipate into a familiar scene of mild chaos as they pressed their way onto the standing - room - only bus			1
it 's a squeeze : commuters on the subway in @entity0 pack into a busy train			1
" this is n't too bad -- actually much better than the subway , " observed the 35 - year - old graphic designer one recent evening as he boarded the bus for home , some 6 kilometers away but easily a 40 - minute trip in the capital 's choking traffic			2
as far as the preferred mode of public transportation goes , however , @entity3 belongs to a growing number of @entity0 residents who are opting for the slower bus to the supposedly far more efficient subway			1
the @entity33 system , the country 's oldest , is undergoing an unprecedented expansion ahead of the @entity35			1
three new lines will begin whisking passengers to and fro before the @entity39 start in august and , by 2020 , the route map will comprise 19 lines and 561 kilometers of tracks , making the network one of the world 's largest			1
once a loyal subway rider , @entity3 has given up on the train since last autumn			0
that was when the city authorities , in a bid to attract drivers of private cars off the road , slashed the ticket prices on the subway -- by more than half in some cases -- and introduced a flat fare of 2 yuan ( 30 @entity57 cents ) with unlimited transfers			1
the result has been undesirable : surface roads remain congested and now so are subway stations			2
" almost overnight the trains became so jam - packed that it was just mission impossible during rush hours , " @entity3 recalled			0
" i always had to wait for four or five trains , and then got shoved into the train by the crowd behind me without having to lift my foot			0
" other awkward moments ensued inside the sardine can - like carriages			0
" as people typed on their phones right under my eyes , i was often forced to read their messages -- including a woman confessing to her husband about an affair , " @entity3 reminisced with some amusement			0
after a few weeks of endurance , @entity3 switched to the bus for a more dependable daily ride			0
" on paper the subway is a lot faster , but buses are less crowded and have dedicated lanes on many streets -- i end up spending about the same amount of time on the road , " he explained			2
@entity3 's sentiment echoes those of many others , prompting media coverage and online debates on the city 's increasingly strained subway system whose average daily users exceed 3.5 million			1
busy stations not only deploy " door pushers " to help commuters squeeze into the carriages during peak times but also limit the number of passengers on the platforms out of safety concerns			2
amid mounting complaints about the system 's glaring inadequacy , officials have reassured the public the problems are growing pains			0
they promise a much more enjoyable journey when improved signals system and state - of - the - art trains are in place in the coming months			0
@entity3 has decided to stick to the bus for now , having learned about new airport - like security checks at major subways stations ahead of the @entity35			1
although the mostly non-air conditioned buses offer a rather unpleasant passenger experience during @entity0 's long hot summer days , @entity3 unfortunately does n't have the one fallback option most of his fellow countrymen do			1
" i ca n't bike , " he admitted , blaming his mountainous hometown			0
" many of us from @entity131 have never learned how to bike because it 's just impractical to pedal in the hilly terrain			0
" @entity135 is a @entity0 - based freelance writer and former @entity2 producer .			2

more @entity0 commuters shunning *overcrowded* subway in favor of city 's buses
city authorities attracted more passengers to trains when ticket prices were cut
roads still jammed while subway network is expanded ahead of @entity35
