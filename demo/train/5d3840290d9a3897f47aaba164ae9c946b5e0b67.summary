-- you know those electronic collars that zap dogs that stray outside their electronic fences ? that seems to be the purpose of everyone 's favorite and seemingly innocuous phrase , " man up			1
" just mumbling those two words in a typical guy 's direction delivers a psychological shock that discourages him from venturing outside the restrictions of our traditional view of what it means to be a man			1
famed author @entity23 , known for his machismo and string of women , once said " tough guys do n't dance " -- something i 'm sure would be news to the men of the @entity32 , who are known for their machismo , string of women and , well , dancing in the end zone wearing tights			2
but that 's the beauty of " man up			1
" sometimes it 's the punchline shared among friends			2
sometimes a mandate from strangers			0
at no point is it uniformly defined			0
@entity47 ' @entity46 mess : is coach to blame ? the irony in all of this , of course , is that it takes more strength to follow one 's own parameters than to stick to those handed down by the collective			1
a truth we 're constantly reminded of in @entity61 verses ; @entity63 's " @entity62 " ; and pop culture fixtures , like the 1976 flick " @entity66 , " in which the cross-dressing character , @entity67 , confronts a critic with the iconic line : " i 'm more man than you 'll ever be and more woman than you 'll ever get			1
" and yet , despite these constant reminders of the strength it takes to be ourselves , when presented with an opportunity to recognize that strength , someone yells " man up " and we all retreat back behind the electronic fence : ridiculing , teasing , sometimes bullying , those who do n't immediately follow suit			2
because of this , it 's hard to ignore the comical dichotomy that is @entity86 masculinity today : boisterous grandstanders too afraid to look in the mirror and deal with their own crap			2
a nation of men stunted by what is known as alexithymia -- an inability to " discriminate the usual nuances of emotional life " as defined by @entity98 , author of " @entity99 : an @entity100			2
" psychologist @entity101 believes " a mild form of alexithymia is very widespread among adult men			0
" he says it 's a product of the " male emotional socialization ordeal , which requires boys to restrict the expression of their vulnerable and caring emotions and to be emotionally stoic			1
" which makes sense , when you think about the first time we hear things like " man up " or " be a man			0
" it 's never when we 're suppressing sensitivity , it 's only when we express it			0
lack of connection with our feelings hurts our ability to empathize			0
and if we ca n't feel with others , how can we truly feel for others ? this complexity is being played out in @entity128 this week			0
the @entity129 is reporting that @entity130 , the man accused of bullying his @entity132 teammate @entity131 , was told by coaches to " toughen up " @entity131			0
" i 'm just trying to weather the storm right now , " @entity130 said			0
" and there 's plenty of evidence to suggest he 's right , for it is @entity131 -- the @entity47 lineman who left the team , exasperated by months of bullying -- who is widely being criticized for not manning up			1
as @entity147 safety @entity145 tweeted , " in this world in general people will do what u allow them to do			0
" he was referring to his interpretation of @entity131 's inaction , but that could easily be applied to the group of similarly sized men who ganged up on young @entity131 and dubbed him " @entity156 " because he was n't the " norm			1
" @entity130 , a designated team leader , was emboldened because none of @entity131 's teammates manned up and stopped him			0
or worse yet , maybe someone did want to stop him but was too afraid to cross the " man up " electronic fence , a fence few men -- including myself -- are willing to cross on a regular basis			1
so we do what was done to us -- tell little boys not to cry , chastise classmates for being soft - spoken , let a co-worker know that he needs to grow a pair			0
it 's all fun and games until someone 's feelings get hurt , right ? and then you read a story , like the one of 17 - year - old @entity178 -- who last week jumped to his death from a pedestrian bridge near his high school , and who some said was a victim of bullying -- and you remember : sometimes the continuous call to fit in , to " man up , " hurts more than just our feelings			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			1

@entity191 says men have an *ingrained* fear of expressing their emotions
they use " man up " as a tool to help *enforce* the *prohibition* against acting human , he says
@entity191 : this *mechanism* was in play in the @entity47 *locker* room
he asks : who 's getting the blame ? the bullies or the victim ?
