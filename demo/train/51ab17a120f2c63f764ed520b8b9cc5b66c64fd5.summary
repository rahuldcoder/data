here we wo n't go again			2
no " third time 's a charm			0
" no invoking @entity6 's two failed presidential campaigns			0
no 47 % , car elevators or dog on the roof			1
the media can say goodbye to a plethora of story lines as it prepares to cover the 2016 presidential race			2
but other than mourning the ( substantial ) loss of some well - tread fodder , the announcement that @entity2 will not be running for president a third time does little to change the 2016 outlook for @entity22			1
there 's still an establishment candidate in @entity25 , if he runs			0
and the rest of the very deep @entity22 bench -- with the possible exceptions of sen. @entity29 and gov. @entity30 -- would have run whether @entity2 was in it or not			1
but the absence of @entity2 in the field is a big loss for @entity35 , who were not - so - secretly hoping he 'd throw his hat in one more time			1
proof that they were salivating over the opportunity was president @entity42 's open mockery of @entity2 at thursday night 's speech to @entity44 @entity35 : " we 've got a former presidential candidate on the other side who suddenly is just deeply concerned about poverty			1
that 's great ! let 's go ! come on ! let 's do something about it ! " it 's pretty rich that the sitting president who has presided over a widening of the income gap and a worsening of poverty would take a shot at anyone else who tried to offer solutions			0
and he was n't alone			0
@entity42 's former campaign advisers , as well as @entity64 mayor @entity63 and plenty others in the media piled on the criticism of @entity2 's anti-poverty message			1
again , @entity35 ca n't brag that their policies have helped			0
and , they could very well nominate another multimillionaire who has had just as much difficulty explaining her wealth to ordinary @entity73 in @entity74			0
so on its face , it would seem a dangerous gamble to attack @entity2 for trying to address poverty			1
but that 's how confident @entity35 are that their 2012 narratives successfully and decisively defined @entity2 as an out - of - touch plutocrat			1
yes , they are living in glass houses -- and they are stockpiling stones			0
i 've heard from dozens , if not hundreds of people who watched the @entity89 documentary " @entity2 " and said , if only we 'd seen that @entity2 in 2012			2
but that 's just it -- the @entity2 that actually exists , the one we see in the film and know off the campaign trail , is no match for the @entity2 that the left has created			2
it 's also a shame , because the @entity2 that actually exists would have been a formidable candidate and might have been a great president			2
but it 's a lesson to the rest of the 2016 @entity22 field : do n't get defined early , and do n't save your best material for the after - party .			0

@entity114 : *democrats* were very eager for @entity2 to run
she says they will have to *discard* the " 47 *percent* " and " car elevator " attack lines
