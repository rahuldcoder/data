-- hopes soared recently when the @entity3 government said it had reached a deal with the terrorist group @entity5 to free more than 200 girls and young women still missing after a mass abduction in april			1
but with each passing day , it looks less and less likely that the girls will be freed			2
in fact , @entity5 has kidnapped numerous other young people in at least two incidents that have happened since the @entity3 government reported a deal			1
@entity5 kidnaps 30 in northeast @entity3 what 's going on ? who and what is @entity5 ? the name " @entity5 " translates to " @entity21 education is sin " in the local @entity23 language			1
the group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of @entity28 law across @entity3 , which is split between a majority @entity30 north and a mostly @entity33 south			2
the group was founded 12 years ago by charismatic cleric @entity34			0
police killed him in 2009 in an incident captured on video and posted to the @entity38			0
@entity5 is now led by @entity39			2
in recent years , its attacks have intensified in an apparent show of defiance amid the nation 's military onslaught			0
its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the @entity3 government			2
the militant group has bombed schools , churches and mosques ; kidnapped women and children ; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike			2
what was agreed upon in the ceasefire deal ? @entity3 officials said on october 16 that president @entity60 's government had reached a ceasefire agreement with @entity5 after a month of negotiations			1
but officials provided few details about the release			2
@entity65 , a government spokesman , did not specify when the girls would be freed			0
he said not all would be let go at once , but a " significant number " would be released soon			0
the @entity3 government had also consented to some demands by @entity5 , but @entity65 declined to provide details			1
@entity5 has remained silent on the deal the government said it signed with the group in neighboring @entity74 last week			1
@entity3 officials have emphasized there is no set time line for release of the girls , which likely would happen on a piecemeal basis instead of all at once			1
so is there actually a deal ? @entity83 , who studies jihad , wrote on october 18 that he had doubts about a deal going through			0
" it remains to be seen whether this truce will actually materialize , whether it is merely an election ploy for @entity3 's embattled president , @entity60 , and most crucially whether it will bring about the release of numerous captives taken by @entity5 during the past year , " he wrote in an analysis for @entity0			1
" while @entity5 has suffered some reverses during the recent past , there is no indication that the group has suffered any mortal damage			2
the most plausible interpretation of the truce is that it is a bought one ( probably in tandem with the @entity103 release of captives ) , and that @entity5 is merely using it ( assuming that it holds to the truce at all ) as a respite in order to regroup			1
" in an article written for @entity0 the day after @entity3 announced the ceasefire , @entity109 ' @entity108 wrote : " this is a case when we will actually need to see the girls emerging from their six - month confinement before we can truly believe			1
" what has @entity5 done since @entity3 announced the truce ? @entity5 gunmen kidnapped at least 30 boys and girls from a village in northeast @entity3 during the weekend			1
last week @entity5 militia kidnapped 60 women and girls in two @entity33 villages in neighboring @entity127 state , according to residents and community leaders			1
the heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira , or about $ 9 , and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted saturday , suggesting that they would be taken as sex slaves , residents told @entity0			0
then on friday and saturday , heavily armed @entity5 gunmen invaded the town of @entity140 in @entity126 and seized 30 boys and girls , local leaders said			1
" they took them away to their base in the bush , and we believe they are going to use them as foot soldiers , " @entity140 local government chairman @entity143 said			0
@entity151 , the local chief of @entity140 who confirmed the abductions , said the kidnappers also stole 300 cows from the farming community in the raid			0
the @entity3 government has said @entity5 has denied involvement in the kidnappings , but the group has issued no public statement on the issue			1
are @entity5 and @entity3 's government really interested in peace ? @entity108 argues that " the campaign for the @entity3 presidency has effectively merged with the campaign to defeat @entity5			1
" " if the government is successful in brokering a lasting ceasefire with @entity5 and bringing home these girls , @entity60 would undoubtedly get a significant boost in his reelection efforts			1
" in july last year , professor of african history and peace studies at the @entity175 wrote an opinion piece for @entity0 in which he argued that @entity5 had no reason to pursue peace			2
" leader @entity39 and some of the group 's other senior members have nothing to gain from any permanent peace -- especially as the international community has already cast them in the mold of former @entity187 leader @entity186			0
as they await eventual capture , they will not mind causing more trouble , " @entity188 said			0
director of the @entity195 @entity194 noted in may that president @entity60 had not commented on the schoolgirls ' abduction for two weeks after the incident			0
the reason , @entity194 argued , was that the problems of the northeast region did not matter to his government as there was no incentive to develop the region			0
" it produces nothing and will not vote for president @entity60 , " he wrote			0
why did @entity5 abduct the girls ? @entity210 , a human rights activist in northern @entity3 who has previously been involved in mediating with @entity5 , told @entity0 in may that the mass april abduction and other recent attacks were messages to the @entity3 government that the recent arrest of @entity5 followers in @entity218 schools will be avenged			1
in 2012 , @entity39 's wife and three children were reportedly taken into military custody			0
@entity210 said he believed @entity5 targeted the girls to force concessions from the @entity3 government -- beginning perhaps with the release of @entity5 followers from prisons			1
" the fact @entity39 said he would sell the girls and did not say he would kill them is a clear indication that negotiation is possible , " he said			0
but at least some of them may be traded for ransom money			0
@entity5 has begun trading hostages for cash -- most notably in the case of a @entity237 family kidnapped in northern @entity103 last year and reportedly freed for some $ 3 million			1
the international outrage sparked by the abduction also serves @entity39			0
" it has put pressure on the government to reach out to him , " @entity210 said has @entity5 negotiated before ? @entity39 is not beyond negotiating with the @entity3 government , despite his apocalyptic rhetoric and frequent denials of president @entity60 's legitimacy			1
according to the @entity247 , negotiations in @entity246 a year ago were on the verge of producing " an apparent peace agreement that was to begin with a ceasefire			0
" then @entity39 was designated a terrorist by the @entity252 and abandoned the talks			0
what are the chances of the girls ' safe return ? @entity258 , an expert on @entity5 with the @entity259 , a @entity261 - based research and analysis firm , said in may that the mass kidnapping may have been part of an effort by @entity39 to reinforce the loyalty of largely uneducated recruits by providing them with " free servants or sex slaves			2
" " many will likely end up becoming mothers -- it 's a real horror and over the next years we 'll slowly hear the stories of girls few - by - few as they manage to make it out , " @entity258 told @entity0			0
" @entity5 has likely split up or sold the girls into many small groups , " and they can be used as human shields in the event of an attack , he said			2
however , if the ceasefire announcement is real , it would appear the girls are alive , leaving hope for the chance of their return .			2

ceasefire between @entity3 and @entity5 raised hopes for release of kidnapped girls
militants have continued their kidnappings even after the deal was reached
some experts doubt that the ceasefire will go through
others say negotiated release is still possible
