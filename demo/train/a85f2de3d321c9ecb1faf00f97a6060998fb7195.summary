an @entity1 tribal leader said saturday that @entity4 militants are gaining ground in @entity7 province , predicting a " collapse within hours " of @entity1 army forces there if tribal forces withdraw			1
@entity11 , a @entity12 leader of the @entity14 tribe , called for more @entity16 intervention -- including ground troops , arming tribes directly or at least pressuring the @entity1 government to give the tribes more firepower			1
while @entity16 officials have said that @entity4 , which calls itself the @entity23 , is on the defensive in @entity1 and @entity25 , @entity11 says that 's definitely not the case where he is			1
" in @entity7 , we are losing ground , not gaining , " he said			1
thousands of families had been under siege in the town of @entity33 until getting help friday from @entity16 - led coalition airstrikes and @entity1 forces , according to @entity11			1
but he said @entity1 troops had pulled out of @entity33 on saturday , at which time @entity4 was shelling the town			1
if the @entity41 extremist group 's fighters go in , @entity11 predicted a massacre			0
anbar province is just west of @entity44 , meaning a decisive @entity4 victory would put militants on the footsteps of the @entity1 capital			1
it 's home to the strategic @entity50 , which came under attack friday			0
talking about that battle , @entity53 spokesman rear adm. @entity52 said 20 to 25 people -- most , if not all , of whom were wearing @entity1 military uniforms and were led by suicide bombers -- attacked the nearly 25 - square - mile base			2
" it looks like ( @entity4 militants ) at least got to the outer base limits , " @entity52 said			2
at least 13 @entity1 soldiers died in the assault , said @entity11 , which ended with @entity1 ground forces killing all the attackers			2
@entity16 troops were on the base at the time , but " several kilometers " from where the fighting happened , @entity52 said			0
the @entity16 military did deploy attack helicopters in that @entity4 assault , but the @entity75 returning safely without firing a shot , military sources said			2
@entity16 helicopter gunships were also involved in a fight supporting @entity1 ground forces about 15 kilometers ( 9 miles ) north in the @entity7 town of @entity80 , according to sources			1
@entity82 , the @entity83 tribal leader , said militants killed at least 25 @entity1 police officers during their assault on that town thursday and friday			1
on saturday , the @entity16 military said @entity88 was " contested , " as @entity1 forces fought back			2
@entity7 is important not just for its location , for the @entity92 base or for the @entity94 dam , @entity1 's second largest			1
it 's significant for its sectarian breakdown -- as a mostly @entity12 province in a @entity100 - led country			0
sectarian divisions have hurt @entity1 before , with @entity4 ' rampage through much of @entity1 ( as well as neighboring @entity25 ) blamed in part to the country 's lack of unity			1
it 's one reason for then - prime minister @entity109 's exit last year , replaced by current leader @entity110			0
the @entity16 government has gotten involved to address such tensions as part of its anti-terrorism fight , such as president @entity117 's warning last june -- a few months before @entity109 stepped down -- that " there wo n't be a military solution " unless @entity100 , @entity120 and @entity121 all play significant parts in @entity1 's command structure			0
years before , in the mid- 2000s , the @entity16 recruited and paid @entity120 like members of @entity11 's @entity83 tribe to join its fight against @entity128			0
those efforts helped turn the tide in the war			0
but now , @entity11 says , @entity4 -- which consists of @entity12 extremists -- is making his tribe pay the price			0
" there are people who will be killed in cold blood , and there will be more massacres , " @entity11 told @entity2 in november			0
" we are getting killed because of our friendship with the @entity16			0
does a friend abandon his friend like this ? " @entity2 's @entity144 and @entity145 contributed to this report .			0

tribal leader warns of a massacre if @entity4 moves into @entity7 province town
he says @entity4 is gaining ground in the @entity1 province , which is just west of @entity44
