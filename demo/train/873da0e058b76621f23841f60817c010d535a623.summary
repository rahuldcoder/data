-- i 'm lost ! for @entity6 book fans , the " @entity4 , @entity3 " story is an ideal gift for holiday road trips			1
hopelessly , completely lost on a winding , backcountry road somewhere in @entity12 , @entity9 did i mention it was night and pitch - black ? " how could you do this ? " asks my aggravated 16 - year - old daughter , @entity17			2
i 'm not even sure			2
one minute we 're on the highway and a couple of wrong turns later , here we are			2
none of the maps in the car showed the road we were on			2
finally , we spot some open shops and a kind saleswoman in the @entity29 gave me directions			2
guess what i want somebody to give me this holiday ? a portable gps ! ( are you listening , elves ? ) @entity38 ( www.llbean.com ) has some that are under $ 100 , @entity37 ( www.tomtom.com ) , has some for under $ 250			1
a gps would be a welcome gift for any traveling family			1
it 's no fun getting lost , whether close to home or on vacation in an unfamiliar city or country			2
of course , my favorite gift of all would be a trip			1
give those you love most the gift of an adventure together someplace new , or someplace that holds special memories , whether you are celebrating a special anniversary , birthday or simply a good year			1
outfitters , cruise lines and resorts will help you arrange a custom itinerary -- and give you a good " reunion " deal too			2
just make sure you get everyone on board with the idea before you fork over your credit card for those nonrefundable deposits			2
give the adults different guidebooks about the region and if you are planning a trip to foreign shores , give each of the kids some euros , @entity76 , etc. , to spend when they get there			1
they 'll have fun and maybe hone a few math skills figuring out how much they 've really got to spend			0
maybe you want to encourage your kids ' or grandkids ' interest in exploring the world beyond their community			1
buy them a subscription to @entity86 ( www.shopng.org ) and for preschoolers , @entity86 ( subscriptions are just $ 15 a year			1
) those planning road trips or plane trips with their children will thank you every time they travel , if you slip a portable dvd player under the tree or next to the @entity95			1
@entity96 ( www.disneyshopping.com ) has a new one that 's compact and has twin 7 - inch lcd screens and two sets of headphones			0
it sells for $ 179.99			0
of course , you 'll need a couple of new dvds to watch			0
how about encouraging the young chefs in the gang with @entity106 's " @entity105 , " or spark your little pirate 's sense of adventure with " @entity110 : at @entity111			0
" if you 're planning a holiday trip , bring along your favorite holiday movie			0
books on tape are also a great bet for families who prefer the road to the skies			1
the story can become a shared experience because everyone , including the driver , can listen at the same time , assuming you can get the older kids to turn off their ipods			1
there are plenty of holiday stories , like " @entity130 " performed by @entity131 , who read the @entity134 books so well , @entity136 's " @entity135 " ( www.randomhouse.com/audio ) read by @entity137 or @entity138 reading her book " @entity139 , " which i just listened to on a long drive in @entity142			0
also check out @entity143 ( www.brillianceaudio.com ) for other titles like @entity145 's " @entity146 " about the adventures -- and misadventures of an intrepid middle - school reporter			0
good old - fashioned books , of course , are great gifts too , especially if you can find one that relates to an experience you 've shared on vacation or to a place you plan to visit			0
ask your local children 's librarian for suggestions			0
maybe you 've taken the kids to @entity162 or the @entity163 , if so check out " the @entity164 " ( www.kidscanpress.com ) , which features beautiful illustrations that play tricks on the eye -- great to read together on a plane or at a relative 's house			1
if you 've been to @entity171 , buy your @entity6 book fans ( www.americangirl.com ) the " @entity4 , @entity3 " story about a girl growing up around @entity171 in the 1970s who celebrates the @entity176 with her best friend			0
an added plus : it will be fun for moms to share what their lives were like " back in the old days " through these historically accurate tales			0
i also like the @entity184 from @entity6			0
no one should travel these days without a camera in his or her pocket -- to capture all those funny moments that do n't always end up in the family scrapbook			1
even better , the kids can take charge of creating family vacation web pages			1
the experts at @entity194 ( @entity196 ) suggest the @entity197 ( $ 379.95 ) because it is shockproof , waterproof , crushproof and only weights 5.5 ounces			0
for teens , check out the @entity200 ( $ 249.95 ) , which comes in bright colors and is about the size of a credit card			0
the @entity204 also features a @entity206 mode so they can upload videos to the @entity208			0
the experts suggest the @entity210 ( under $ 150 ) for kids as young as six			1
no one , including kids , should travel without a lightweight , rolling duffel			1
@entity216 ( www.landsend.com ) or @entity38 ( www.llbean.com ) offer them in a variety of colors and while you 're at it , order a monogrammed fleece blanket for each child for those interminable car trips			0
i 'm also a fan of fleece jackets and vests for travel because they 're lightweight and dry quickly			1
you can find them everywhere , even for young kids			1
( check out the selection at @entity233 ( www.patagonia.com )			0
