-- the final election results are in for the 19th @entity2 in @entity3 , and the only thing that 's clear is @entity3 voters are pretty evenly divided across the political spectrum			1
the newspaper @entity7 and the independent @entity9 - based @entity8 each projected the seats won based on the vote totals , and they agreed that right wing and center - right parties are likely to end up with 61 of the legislative seats , while left wing and center - left parties , including @entity18 parties , will probably garner 59 seats			0
while the totals are " final , " now that votes from soldiers , diplomats , prisoners and others have been tallied , they wo n't be " official " until january 30			0
the results came as a surprise to prime minister @entity29 and his @entity30			2
@entity29 's supporters had 42 seats in the outgoing @entity2 , but he is projected to retain only 31 in the new legislature			0
the prime minister indicated wednesday that he might try to attract centrists into a government coalition rather than form a hard - right bloc in @entity3 's politically diverse parliament			1
he announced a focus on three issues dear to the upstart center - left @entity42 party , which is projected to capture 19 @entity2 seats : increasing equality in the burden on the public , seen as a reference to the practice , unpopular among secularists , of giving military exemptions to the @entity52 ; the grinding issue of affordable housing ; and changing what many see as @entity3 's " ineffective " system of government			1
@entity0 's @entity58 contributed to this report			0

@entity3 's election results are final , but not yet official
*experts* say the new @entity2 will be equally divided between left - and right - wing politicians
prime minister @entity29 's center - right party lost clout ; a centrist coalition may result
