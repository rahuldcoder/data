@entity0 , @entity1 -- first , an 11 - foot wooden cross was stolen from @entity4 in @entity0 , @entity1			1
then , weeks later , the cross was discovered set aflame in the middle of the night outside the bedroom window of a 19 - year - old woman of mixed race			1
now authorities are investigating the case as a theft , arson and hate crime , police said tuesday			1
the burning cross was erected in a neighbor 's large front yard adjacent to the house rented by the woman and her mother			1
the mystery of who stole the cross and set it afire has deeply disturbed the small coastal town of @entity0 , located midway between @entity26 and @entity27			1
it sits in the heart of a wine region , just 47 miles northwest of the vineyards depicted in the movie " @entity33			0
" police chief @entity34 told @entity2 tuesday that a cross-burning is unheard of for his community of 17,000 , and that only three hate crimes have been reported in his town the past 15 years , mostly for uttering slurs			1
that figure is the lowest for @entity41 , he said			0
with a picturesque mountain backdrop and only about 5.5 square miles in size , @entity0 calls itself " the gem " of the central @entity1 coast			1
authorities have announced a $ 3,500 reward in the case and even established a " @entity51 in @entity0 " fund - raiser to raise that amount			1
but an attorney for the alleged victim and her mother has criticized the police investigation			1
" the family is trying to go about daily business , but they have ongoing concerns about their security and the direction of the investigation , " attorney @entity56 told @entity2 on tuesday			1
" for example , if there are known racist elements in the community , it is not clear that the police are looking at these groups			2
it appears that it would be a logical starting point for an investigation , if there are known racist groups in the community			2
the first problem is that the police initially treated this as a prank and may have lost the opportunity to conduct an effective investigation , " @entity56 said			1
@entity0 police have not released the name of the 19 - year - old woman , citing confidentiality provisions under @entity1 hate - crime laws			1
@entity34 , the police chief , said his agency moved quickly over the weekend following the cross burning , which occurred on a friday , and is now working with the @entity96 , the @entity89 , @entity41 district attorney 's investigators and the @entity92			1
his agency is also working with the @entity97 and the @entity98 , he said			0
" it 's funny that he would even say that because we have a very good relationship with the victim and the mother from the start , " @entity34 said about the family 's attorney			1
" like with most crimes , you look at who would want to do this , and have you been involved in any activities that would lead someone to do this , or do you know somebody who would , " the police chief said			1
" i 'm very comfortable that we handled this appropriately , " he continued			0
" we have been given access to any resources that the @entity96 has			0
and for a local agency like this , it 's unprecedented			2
" @entity34 said police never called the cross-burning a " prank , " saying that word was misattributed by local media			1
agencies are now pursuing several leads , and he believes the cross-burning is n't the work of an organized hate group , he said			1
" we feel right now that it 's people who are local			2
we do n't think it 's an organized group or anything like that			2
it 's bloggers who want to raise that issue , " the chief said			2
" there 's no active hate groups in @entity0 , none that we 're aware of			1
we 're working with the @entity96 , so we 're pretty confident			0
" @entity0 police submitted physical evidence from the cross-burning scene to an independent crime lab for forensic analysis , authorities said			1
authorities are also analyzing an " accelerant " used on the cross , @entity34 said			2
in an interview with @entity2 at her home , the mother said she and her daughter looked out their window after midnight march 18 and were horrified by the sight of a burning cross just 12 feet from their house			1
" we were just blindsided			0
my daughter does not have a beef with anyone			0
my daughter had a friend over and we looked out the window and there it was , a huge burning cross , " the mother said			1
" we are just trying to maintain normalcy			0
we would like to see whoever did this caught , " the mother said			0
she added that her daughter " is doing better now -- i bought her a puppy			0
she can give some love instead of all that hate and anger			2
" the cross was stolen from the grounds of @entity4 between february 5 and march 5 , police said			2
the exact date is uncertain because church members were n't aware of the theft for a month , police said			0
the cross is ceremonial and was n't an architectural fixture on the church , police said			2
at 12:30 a.m. on march 18 , local police and firefighters were called about the cross-burning			2
by the time they arrived , they found large pieces of charred wood in the wet grass , still burning with about 5 inches of flame , police said			1
@entity198 , pastor of the church where the cross was stolen , said he was disturbed that " a cross which is revered and gives hope was used to put fear into this family and disgust into the community			2
" " first , the cross in @entity208 became this symbol of crucifixion , punishment and awful death			0
then it became the symbol of resurrection , renewal , the symbol of @entity218 of reconciliation , peace and hope			0
now to see it used as a symbol of hate , intolerance and rejection is a misuse and desecration , " @entity198 told @entity2			0
the cross , which was hollow and made of different types of wood , had been used in a local production of " @entity232 " in the community theater , @entity198 said			0
it was often brought to the beach on @entity237 mornings and adorned with bright flowers , @entity198 said			0
many in the community are outraged at the incident			0
the rev. @entity242 , president of the @entity243 , said the group 's 35 religious leaders representing @entity246 , jews , @entity248 , @entity249 and others , signed a letter to the @entity252 condemning the incident			0
" catching someone is less important to me as people coming to grips with the fact that we do not live up to all the ideals of our democracy here in @entity263 , " @entity254 told @entity2			0
" even in a wonderful place like @entity0 , bad things happen			2
i think that that is why some people in @entity0 had such a hard time dealing with this : they did not think a cross-burning could happen in their city , " she said			1
" but i think the good thing is that people are talking about this , discussing this , people of all faiths engaging in dialogue about what happened			0
i think that is very healthy			0
" the police chief described his community as " one of the best secret places in @entity1 to be			1
" " it 's not what i would describe as a heavily multicultural community			0
it 's heavily white , but we do have a number of other cultures represented in the community , " @entity34 said			0
@entity2 's @entity296 contributed to this report			0
