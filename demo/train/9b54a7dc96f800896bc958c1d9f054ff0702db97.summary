-- the @entity1 is expected to vote tuesday on a bill that would ban the use of plastic bags by retailers in the state , including grocery stores , convenience stores and drugstores			1
this year 's @entity1 session ends tuesday , so it 's the last opportunity for the @entity1 to pass the bill			1
the @entity12 passed the legislation in june			1
gov. @entity15 has said he would sign the measure into law , the @entity14 reported			1
environmental groups such as the @entity19 have encouraged @entity20 to contact their state senators to push for the measure			1
the group @entity23 produced what it calls a " mockumentary , " narrated by actor @entity26 , called " @entity27 " that charts the life of a plastic bag			1
the video is on @entity31			0
but the measure has its opponents , too			2
the @entity34 criticized @entity20 assemblywoman @entity35 , @entity36 , who proposed the bill			1
" assemblywoman @entity35 's inflammatory comments are obviously intended to distract public attention from the substance and dire consequences of @entity44 1998 , " the group said			0
" her proposed legislation to ban plastic grocery bags in @entity20 ... is bad for the economy and bad for the environment : it will eliminate several hundred @entity20 manufacturing jobs and dismantle existing plastic bag recycling programs			1
" according to its website , the chemistry council represents companies that " make the products that make modern life possible , while working to protect the environment , public health , and the security of our nation			0
" in this case , that includes plastic bags			2
" we had to work hard to win passage for the bill in the @entity12 and i anticipate an equally hard battle in the @entity1 , " @entity35 told @entity0 in june			2
" nasty habits , like our reliance on plastic and paper bags , are hard to break			2
" @entity35 has been fighting to reduce plastic bag waste for three years , calling single - use bags " an unnecessary scourge that blows like urban tumbleweeds into every corner of the earth			1
" her bill has gained support from the @entity81 , which decided to back the bill after @entity35 agreed to subject all stores that sell groceries to the ban			2
" our hope is the consumer is driven towards reusable bags " , says @entity86 , vice president of the grocers association			0
" we have a huge responsibility to educate consumers			0
" however , @entity86 told @entity0 he 's acutely aware of the speed bumps the legislation might encounter along the road to passage			0
for instance , he said , the bill requires grocery stores to sell reusable bags for at least 5 cents if customers do n't bring their own			0
" with the economy , there 's always the concern when legislation has fees , " @entity86 said			0
@entity20 appear to be split on the issue			1
while some people told @entity110 recently they could go either way , others said a ban would be beneficial			2
" i 'm one of those people who 's really good at picking up cloth bags , and really bad at remembering to bring them to the store , " one woman told @entity110			0
" it could be just the kick i need to make sure i use recycled bags			0
" another wondered whether it really mattered			0
" it 's not just plastic bags			2
i mean , everything else i get that comes in a container is in plastic , " one man told @entity110			2
" just eliminating plastic bags , as far as i 'm concerned , you are not really making that big an impact			0
" so just how much plastic and paper bag waste do we produce a year ? according to @entity140 @entity139 spokeswoman @entity138 , 3.96 million tons of plastic bags , sacks and wraps were generated in 2008 in the @entity140 alone			1
that 's more than three times the 1.17 million tons of waste generated by paper bags and sacks that same year			0
and of that , what 's being recycled ? a combined total of 830,000 tons of plastic and paper bags was recycled in 2008 , while a combined total of 4.3 million tons was discarded , according to the @entity139 -- the equivalent , speaking in terms of weight , of nearly 24 jumbo jets			1
@entity154 already has a ban on plastic bag use , and it 's not the only city where such a law has been discussed			1
@entity159 , @entity160 ; @entity161 , @entity162 ; @entity163 , @entity160 ; and @entity164 , @entity165 , just to name a few , have all considered the environmental impact of plastic bag distribution			1
and then there 's the global initiative currently underway			0
several cities in @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 have all imposed bans or surcharges on plastic bags			0
prior to @entity171 's ban , an estimated 3 billion plastic bags were used on a daily basis , creating more than 3 million tons of garbage each year , according to the website @entity184 , an independent research organization which has programs that focus on areas such as the climate , energy , food and agriculture			1
