@entity0 , @entity1 -- the captain of the container ship @entity5 ignored explicit warnings to stay well off the coast of @entity8 before his capture by pirates in 2009 , according to 16 of its 19 crew members			1
" it 's almost like he wanted to be captured , " the ship 's chief engineer , @entity14 , told @entity2 in an interview to air on tonight 's " @entity17			1
" capt. @entity18 spent four days as a hostage after the attempted seizure of the @entity5			1
after his rescue by @entity23 commandos , @entity18 was lauded as a hero , and the publisher of his new book promoted him as a sea captain who risked his life by offering himself as a hostage " in exchange for the safety of the crew			1
" the 16 crew members have been far less public about the events , even as @entity18 toured the country this spring to promote his book , " a @entity37			1
" but now they are telling a different version of what took place in the waters off the @entity8 coast in early april 2009			1
@entity14 , a 20 - year veteran of the @entity23 , was the chief engineer aboard the @entity5 as it sailed from @entity44 , in the @entity45 , to @entity46 , @entity47 , with a cargo of relief supplies			1
he told @entity2 correspondent @entity50 that @entity18 ' decision " certainly warrants an investigation			2
" " i just want an investigation , for this to be looked at properly before that man winds up going back to sea on another ship and endangering somebody , " @entity14 said			0
@entity14 said he sailed on the @entity5 after the pirate incident and retrieved e-mail warnings -- seven in all -- that urged the @entity5 and other ships in the area to stay clear of the @entity8 coast and sail 600 miles away if necessary to avoid pirate attacks			1
another former crew member , third engineer @entity64 , told @entity2 that @entity18 " was advised to change course by competent deck officers and he overruled them			1
" " stay on course , make our @entity66 , stay on the same course , " @entity64 quoted @entity18 as saying			2
for his part , @entity18 said his preparations went beyond the industry standard for safety			2
he said the crew 's version of events is linked to a suit filed against the @entity79 shipping line @entity77 , which owns the @entity5			1
so far , six former crew members , not including @entity14 , have filed suit , claiming the company " knowingly sent their employees into pirate - infested waters , rather than taking safer routes			1
" " we live in a litigious society , " @entity18 said			2
" so i ca n't really talk about what their complaint is			0
their complaint is with the company , so it 's not my place			0
" @entity77 has no comment on the lawsuit , the company told @entity2			2
according to the @entity23 's @entity98 , the @entity5 was attacked about 380 miles off the @entity8 coast			1
most of the e-mail warnings were sent by a private maritime security agency called @entity103 and were directed at all ships in the area , though one was specifically sent to @entity18			1
each e-mail was based on information from @entity110 and @entity111 naval authorities and urged the @entity5 to stay clear of the shipping lanes where @entity18 was heading			1
" vessels should consider maintaining a distance of more than 600 nautical miles from the @entity8 coastline , " one of the @entity103 messages advised			2
@entity18 acknowledged the existence of those e-mails , but said he could not respond to the accusations because of the lawsuit			1
another crew member , @entity122 -- who goes by the initials " @entity124 " -- told @entity2 that he was on the @entity5 's bridge when the @entity8 pirates began their attack			1
he said he spotted the pirates about three miles behind and to the right of the container ship and said @entity18 " laughed at me " and " ignored me completely " when he reported the fast ship attack			2
@entity18 disputed that account , saying he did not ignore any first warnings			2
" i 'm not someone who laughs a lot			0
ask my crew , do i laugh a lot and tell jokes ? i think the majority will say no , " he said			0
@entity18 conceded , however , that in his book that he erred in identifying @entity122 as a @entity143 -- the sailor is from @entity144 -- and that he was also wrong in writing that @entity122 gained @entity111 citizenship via a lottery			0
and he said the real heroes are the @entity23 and his crew , whom he says stayed calm , followed orders and instincts and prevented a tragedy			0
" they did a wonderful job , " he said			0
" it 's in the book			0
everywhere i speak , i say what a great job they did			0
" as for the widely repeated notion that he gave himself up to the @entity8 pirates in exchange for the safety of his crew , captain @entity18 told @entity2 " the media got everything wrong			1
" " i did n't give myself up , " he said			0
" i was already a hostage by then			0
" he added , " i think you 're forgetting they had guns			0
" sailors aboard the destroyer @entity173 killed three of the four pirates who held @entity18 and captured the fourth , @entity175			0
@entity175 pleaded guilty last week to charges he hijacked the @entity5 and kidnapped the captain , and he faces a maximum sentence of almost 34 years behind bars			2
the crew members who allege @entity18 ignored warnings about @entity8 pirate attacks have created a @entity184 page , " @entity185			1
" @entity14 said none initially wanted to go public with their assertions , but decided to do so as a group after the publication of @entity18 ' book in april			2
" we vowed we were gon na take it to our graves , " he told @entity2			0
" we were n't going to say anything			0
then we hear this pr stuff coming out about giving himself up and he 's still hostage , and the whole crew is like , ' what ? ' " @entity14 told @entity2 the crew had heard numerous international radio broadcasts declaring @entity18 had exchanged himself for the safety of the crew			1
when told that many of his crew feel slighted by him , @entity18 said , " there 's not much i can say			1
" " the media made everything out to be me , " he said			0
" but that 's the media			0
when i came home , i really did n't go and put myself in front of the media			0
a lot of my crew did			0
