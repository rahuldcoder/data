-- @entity1 has been targeted by a new computer worm named @entity3 , according to an @entity1 official			1
" the damage is very slight in the initial stage , " defense official @entity5 told the semi-official news agency @entity6 it was unclear how long ago the worm was discovered or which systems in @entity1 it was designed to penetrate			1
" it is compatible with the ( targeted ) system , " @entity5 said , and " it is likely to be mistaken for executable files of the government			0
" the announcement comes less than a year after @entity1 nuclear facilities were targeted by a highly specialized computer worm called @entity20			1
it was apparently designed to secretly infiltrate the centrifuge machines that refine uranium and make them spin so fast they would break , according to @entity26 of the @entity27			0
" about 10 % of the centrifuges were destroyed by @entity20 , " he said , which resulted in a setback for the @entity1 nuclear program by as much as a year			1
@entity1 officials have said they believe last year 's @entity20 cyberattack originated in @entity35 and the @entity36 , but officials from neither country have commented on the malware 's origin			1
an @entity36 and an @entity35 representative reached by @entity0 about the latest report again declined to comment			0
an official with @entity44 , a computer security firm that decoded the @entity46 last year , said a sample would be required for the company to forensically study the latest program for clues to its origin and its target			2

one of them was killed			0
@entity76 warned that the latest cyberattack on @entity1 could prompt a response			2
" @entity1 does n't usually take things lying down , " he said			2

they 'll probably think of trying to launch a cyberattack			0
" @entity0 's @entity85 and @entity86 contributed to this report .			0

the announcement comes less than a year after @entity1 nuclear facilities were targeted
at the time a computer worm *appeared* to focus on @entity1 's nuclear production *capability*
