one of the three @entity1 agents under investigation for allegedly soliciting sex in @entity4 , @entity5 , had a long - term relationship with a prostitute , potentially exposing himself to blackmail by drug cartels or other criminals , according to two government sources familiar with the investigation			1
investigators at the @entity13 and the @entity1 are trying to determine if that woman was aware that the man she had multiple liaisons with was stationed by the @entity1 in her drug - torn country			2
officials have tried to interview her -- even compelling the agent to get her on the phone -- but have not been able to talk to her yet , the sources said			0
" the reason this is troubling is that these women are really unknown to our law enforcement personnel , " said sen. @entity24 of @entity25 , the top @entity26 on the @entity27 , which is investigating the use of prostitutes by @entity31 agents in @entity5 before president @entity33 's visit there last month			1
" we do n't know if they are associated with drug cartels			1
whether they have been sent into entrap the agents or compromise them in some way which could endanger their mission -- whether it 's protecting the president in the case of the @entity31 agents , or whether it 's pursuing drug activities in the case of the @entity1 agents			2
" the @entity1 agents were not involved in the security for the president 's trip , the government sources said			2
the @entity1 agent 's relationship with the prostitute came to light after a @entity31 agent voluntarily reported to his superiors that he was at a party at the agents ' @entity4 apartment on april 13 with the three @entity1 agents and several women , according to the government sources			1
one of the sources said the @entity31 agent reported that he went into a bedroom with one of the women and had " a massage with a sexual aspect to it			2
" later , the @entity31 agent witnessed the women he was with being paid in local currency by one of the @entity1 agents , the sources said			1
but the @entity31 agent has insisted to investigators that it was not his intention to pay for sex			0
" because of all the pressure , he wanted to self - report and basically confess that this had occurred instead of getting caught , " said a government source who described the @entity31 agent as " guilt - ridden			0
" the @entity31 agent is the 13th agency employee to get caught up in the @entity5 prostitution scandal			1
he is currently on administrative leave but is not expected to lose his job because he came forward on his own to report the incident , according to several sources			0
@entity89 chairman @entity88 , @entity91 - @entity90 , told @entity92 the @entity31 agent took and passed a polygraph test			0
but he said the alleged behavior by the @entity1 agents puts lives at risk			0
@entity88 said any time @entity98 government personnel are " involved in any sexual manner ... you are leaving yourself , at the very least , you 're opening yourself to blackmail			0
secondly in these countries like @entity5 or the old @entity103 bloc , you run the risk ( of people ) being recruited to get something on you or to drug you to get information from you , to compromise you , to kidnap you			1
" the @entity5 scandal will be the subject of a hearing wednesday before sen. @entity113 ' committee			1
@entity31 director @entity114 will testify at the hearing in his first public appearance before @entity117 about the incident			0
in remarks prepared for delivery as her opening statement at the hearing , @entity113 says , " this reckless behavior could easily have compromised individuals charged with the security of the president of the @entity98			2
" she adds , " the facts so far lead me to conclude that , while not at all representative of the majority of @entity31 personnel , this misconduct was almost certainly not an isolated incident			0

sources cite potential for agents being blackmailed by drug cartels or other criminals
the @entity5 prostitution scandal will be the subject of a @entity27 committee hearing
