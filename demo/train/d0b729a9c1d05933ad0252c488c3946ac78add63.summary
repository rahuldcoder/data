the @entity1 military went into @entity2 with one goal in mind : kill @entity5 , the leader of @entity6			1
one day later , @entity8 spokesman rear adm. @entity7 said flatly , " we certainly believe that we hit what we were aiming at			1
" what he did not say is whether @entity5 is dead			1
the @entity1 is " assessing the effectiveness right now " of the attack launched hours earlier , @entity7 said tuesday , including who , if anyone , was killed			1
he did acknowledge that @entity1 special operations forces flew aircraft that , along with unmanned aircraft , " destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several hellfire missiles and laser - guided missiles			1
" no @entity1 troops were on the ground			2
the attack was directed at @entity6 and , specifically , its leader @entity5			1
he has headed the network as it has terrorized @entity27 , killing @entity2 officials , aid workers and others in a spate of suicide bombings			2
@entity5 allegedly was behind 2013 's brazen , ghastly siege of a @entity35 , @entity36 , shopping mall			1
it 's not just what @entity5 , who has pledged his group 's allegiance to @entity40 , has done that made him a target			1
it 's what @entity6 was planning to bring through more bloodshed , chaos and terror to the region			1
the @entity1 government ca n't say yet whether @entity5 survived the attack in south - central @entity2			1
but if he did not , @entity7 surmised , @entity27 is now a safer , better place			0
" if he was killed , this is a very significant blow to their network , to their organization , " the @entity8 spokesman said , " and we believe their ability to continue to conduct terror attacks			1
" an @entity64 account said one person was killed in the attack , but it was n't @entity5			1
" ' @entity5 ' is alive and doing fine , " the tweet from @entity69 said , calling itself an " official mujahedin account " in the @entity73 land of @entity2			1
@entity74 was unable to verify the authenticity of the report			0
@entity2 official : ' never heard such a huge ... blast ' tipped off by what @entity7 called " actionable intelligence ... strong enough " to suggest @entity5 's whereabouts , @entity1 commandos flew -- aided by drones overhead -- into an area south of the @entity87 nation 's capital @entity88 around 6:20 p.m. ( 11:20 a.m. et ) monday			1
@entity90 gov. @entity89 characterized the attack near the port city of @entity93 as so ferocious			0
" it jolted the entire region			0
" " i never heard such a huge and deafening blast as the result of the airstrike , " @entity89 said			0
@entity7 did n't elaborate on exactly how much firepower was used , beyond that there were multiple @entity101 and laser - guided missiles			0
@entity2 intelligence officials counted at least four such missiles			2
the targets were what the @entity8 spokesman described as " an encampment " and a vehicle inside it , not to mention @entity6 leaders believed to be there			1
@entity7 said that he expects the attack -- like others @entity1 forces have conducted against terror groups -- sends a message			2
" the operation that we 've conducted , we believe , is an example of the @entity1 government and our allies and partners ' commitment to the people and the government of @entity2 , " he said , " to detect , deter , disrupt and defeat violent extremists who threaten progress in the region , as well as threaten to conduct terrorist attacks against innocent people around the world			1
" to figure out if the operation achieved its goals , the @entity1 military will need help			2
that 's because , @entity7 explained , no @entity1 forces were on the ground before or after the mission			2
he did n't specify who would get to the bottom of what happened , saying simply , " we continue to work with partners in the region			0
" @entity1 has gone after @entity6 before the @entity1 has previously gone after @entity6 in @entity2			1
that includes at least two strikes this past year ordered by president @entity147 's administration			1
that 's part of a long - running , multinational effort targeting the group , including an operation launched last week to cut off the group 's supply lines along the @entity2 coast			1
@entity6 has been on the defensive of late			2
its militants have started to withdraw from the port city of @entity93 in recent days			0
on monday , the @entity159 in @entity2 announced that military forces had retaken several important towns in the @entity162 and @entity164 regions			0
but no one is counting @entity6 out quite yet			0
the group has shown its audacity and violent ways before			0
it has been blamed , and taken responsibility , for attacks on city streets , at markets , at prisons and a @entity176 compound in @entity88			0
it 's most high - profile attack came last year at @entity35 's upscale @entity179 , when terrorists casually walked into the mall , pulled out weapons and began gunning down shoppers			2
the gunmen were accused of torturing some hostages before killing them			0
as many as 67 people died in the siege , and parts of the mall were destroyed			0
that and many of these other attacks occurred under @entity5 's watch			2
if he 's now gone , @entity74 terrorism analyst @entity194 said , it would be a serious blow to @entity6			2
" @entity197 is a very ruthless figure in the group , he dominates the group , " @entity194 said			0
" you could see a kind of leadership struggle emerge if , indeed , he was killed			0
" but it would n't necessarily be a fatal one			0
@entity5 rose to power in 2008 , after all , when a @entity1 airstrike killed then - leader @entity208			1
" it 's a network , and we understand that , " @entity7 said tuesday			0
" we are mindful that there remain other leaders of the organization , at large			0
" what is @entity6 ?			0

@entity8 spokesman : @entity1 used manned , unmanned aircraft in @entity2 attack
it was launched based on " actionable intelligence , " targeted group 's leader , he says
no *details* on whether @entity6 leader @entity5 is dead or alive
the @entity1 has targeted @entity6 leaders in @entity2 at least twice in the past year
