-- as a young @entity3 officer in @entity4 , @entity1 walked into an ambush that killed dozens of his troops in just a few seconds			2
he responded by single - handedly fighting off repeated @entity8 attacks			2
he overcame his own life - threatening injuries to make several trips through enemy fire to evacuate allied wounded			2
his country decorated him with the @entity15			1
more than 40 years later , @entity1 , a retired colonel , and his fellow @entity15 recipients are bringing their conspicuous gallantry to the cause of education			1
they are offering students priceless lessons in character , courage and selfless service			1
this time , @entity1 is asking for our help			2
in his current mission , @entity1 is raising money to endow the @entity31			2
the program provides teacher training , video tools and lesson plans for schools to integrate character education into curricula			1
@entity15 recipients speak to students , in person or via teleconference			1
it 's embarrassing that @entity15 recipients have to ask for support			1
we should be begging them to do it			2
schools in 38 states are experimenting with the program			1
among participating teachers and students , overwhelming numbers say they would recommend the program to others			2
when asked the most important thing they learned , students report things like sacrifice , honor and courage			2
a remark from one student sums up what @entity1 and others are trying to get across , that @entity15 character lies within all of us			1
" the people are ' normal ' people , " she said , referring to the @entity15 recipients , " so it could be us that become heroes			1
" for a rigorous test , the @entity74 needs more secure footing for the program			2
so the @entity15 recipients , defined by history , have chosen to be obsessed with the future			1
" we ca n't do anything about the past			0
maybe we can improve today , but we better move fast			0
it 's almost gone , " @entity1 said			2
" @entity84 is the only thing we can fix			0
" @entity1 knows about the past			0
on march 9 , 1968 , as a 22 - year - old officer in @entity4 , he demonstrated a kind of heroism that only a few @entity89 know			1
his company commander was wounded in the ambush			0
@entity1 took command and repositioned the troops			0
the @entity15 citation explains the rest : " despite profuse bleeding from head wounds which impaired his vision , capt. @entity1 , with complete disregard for his safety , returned under intense fire to evacuate a seriously wounded advisor to the safety of a wooded area where he administered lifesaving first aid			1
he then returned through heavy automatic weapons fire to evacuate the wounded company commander			0
capt. @entity1 made repeated trips across the fire - swept open rice paddies evacuating wounded and their weapons			0
on 3 separate occasions , capt. @entity1 contacted and drove off @entity8 squads who were searching for allied wounded and weapons , single - handedly killing 3 and wounding several others			0
his gallant actions and extraordinary heroism saved the lives of 1 @entity89 advisor and 13 allied soldiers			1
" when president @entity123 presented @entity1 with the @entity15 in october 1969 , there were close to 400 living recipients			1
today , there are 79			0
the retired sergeant was 91			0
the retired first lieutenant was 90			0
@entity130 , retired from the @entity131 , died in early 2012			0
@entity1 will turn 68 in august			0
he can do the math. from the @entity135 and @entity136 wars , there are four living @entity15 recipients			1
the older ones , older men ( one woman received the @entity15 , in 1861 ) from older wars , are facing a shared mortality , decades after many of their individual actions defied mortality			1
" we feel the unrelenting press of time , " @entity1 said			0
it is fitting that for their last act of service , these @entity15 recipients are fighting for the future of @entity89 's ' children , not to memorialize their heroics			1
it is up to a private philanthropy , the @entity157 , to do what the government has not			0
we need to guarantee a future for the @entity161			0
it is our chance to hold on to the best of our nation			0
@entity1 , a foundation board member , believes that a $ 20 million endowment would secure the @entity161 's future -- beyond the lives of the 79 living recipients			1
with our collective resources , the price tag is a bargain			0
when i asked @entity1 to tell me about that day on the @entity176 back in march 1968 , he demonstrated the kind of selflessness that distinguishes @entity15 recipients			1
" you can look it up , " he said , preferring to speak about the service of others , not his own experience			0
he shared the incredible story of another @entity15 recipient , @entity187 , an @entity3 corporal whose experience in a @entity190 prison camp from 1950 - 53 carries unmatched lessons in character , courage and selfless service			1
you can look it up			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

@entity199 : @entity15 recipients looking to share their view of character and courage
their foundation is testing educational programs in schools in 38 states , he says
@entity199 says the medal recipients sacrificed for @entity89 and *deserve* our support
there 's real urgency because the number of medal recipients is *dwindling* , he says
