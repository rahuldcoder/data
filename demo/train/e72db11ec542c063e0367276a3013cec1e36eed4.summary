it was a sarcastic @entity1 comment during an argument about a video game			1
and , according to the father of 19 - year - old @entity6 , it was enough to land his son behind bars for months , facing the possibility of years in prison			1
@entity6 , who is currently on suicide watch in @entity12 near @entity13 , @entity14 , has been locked up since february			1
he faces a charge of making terroristic threats , a felony that could theoretically bring a sentence of up to eight years			2
" he 's very depressed			2
he 's very scared and he 's very concerned that he 's not going to get out , " @entity19 , @entity6 's father , told @entity20 on tuesday			1
" he 's pretty much lost all hope			2
" in february , @entity6 , then 18 , and a friend were arguing on @entity1 with someone else over the online video game " @entity25			1
" " someone had said something to the effect of ' oh you 're insane			2
you 're messed up in the head , ' " @entity19 told @entity20 affiliate @entity30 in @entity32			2
" to which he replied ' oh yeah , i 'm real messed up in the head			0
i 'm going to go shoot up a school full of kids and eat their still - beating hearts			0
' " according to court documents , @entity6 wrote " i 'm f --- ed in the head alright			1
i think @entity43 ( sic ) shoot up a kindergarten and watch the blood of the innocent rain down and eat the beating heart of one of them			0
" @entity19 said his son followed the claim with " lol " and " @entity53 " -- indicating that the comment was n't serious			1
but someone else -- @entity6 says a woman in @entity57 -- noticed the comment and reported it to authorities			1
coming two months after the deadly shootings at an elementary school in @entity63 , @entity64 , the report was n't taken lightly			0
according to court documents , @entity6 lived less than a half - mile from an elementary school in @entity67 , @entity14			1
a search warrant was issued on february 13 and , a week later , a judge issued a warrant for his arrest			1
" i thought it was a joke , " @entity19 told @entity20			2
" i could n't believe the person that called me			0
i kept telling them they have to be kidding			0
when i realized he was n't , i literally broke down crying			0
" a judge set bond for @entity6 at $ 500,000 , meaning that 10 % of that , or $ 50,000 , would have to be posted to get him out of jail while he awaits trial			1
his lawyer , @entity83 , says that 's far more than his family can afford			0
" it 's outrageous , " @entity83 , who is working the case for free , told @entity20 tuesday			2
" i 've represented murderers and their bond was $ 150,000			0
" @entity83 said he planned to meet with @entity6 tuesday afternoon and ask a judge for the bond to be reduced			1
he said police did n't find any weapons or other items to suggest that @entity6 's comment was serious , but that , " in the times we 're living in , it was kind of a perfect storm			1
" " the law enforcement , the sheriff 's department , the district attorney 's office -- nobody wants to be the one that let him go , " @entity83 said			0
" they do n't think about the person or the crime or the lack of crime ... they do n't want to take responsibility for something happening in the future			0
" a spokeswoman for the police department in @entity32 , where @entity6 was originally jailed , referred a request for comment and arrest documents to neighboring @entity121			1
a police department spokesman there did not immediately respond to a similar request			0
meanwhile , people have come together online to support the jailed teen			1
a change.org petition titled " @entity128 and change the @entity129 for @entity130 " had received nearly 35,000 digital signatures as of tuesday afternoon			1
" too many teenagers are being arrested , jailed and having their lives forever altered because of anti-terrorism laws and investigations that impede their 1st amendment right to freedom of speech , " reads the petition			2
@entity19 says that , as a parent , he understands why authorities are so vigilant about threats of school violence			0
" i definitely see the need to investigate such claims			0
absolutely , " he said			0
" but at some point during the investigation there has to be some common sense			0
