@entity0 's well - known @entity8 jail complex has been featured in films , television shows and documentaries , but life on the other side of the bars appears less than glamorous			1
a number of well - known or infamous inmates have been at least briefly incarcerated there , from the late @entity18 bassist @entity19 to , more recently , former @entity21 receiver @entity20 and rapper @entity20			2
however , many celebrities find the facilities in the @entity8 complex a far cry from the surroundings they may be used to			2
@entity29 head @entity28 is the latest well - known inmate at @entity8			1
he was transferred there on monday after a @entity32 judge refused to grant him bail			0
@entity28 faces multiple charges stemming from an alleged sexual assault of a housekeeping employee at @entity0 's @entity38 hotel			2
@entity8 , actually a complex of 10 different units located in the @entity0 borough of @entity42 , dates to the 1930s , when the first facility -- the @entity45 , formerly known as the @entity46 -- opened , according to the @entity0 @entity47			1
once a 90 - acre site , @entity8 was enlarged to more than 400 acres using sanitary landfill , according to the department 's website			1
it is an actual island , accessible only by a bridge from @entity42 , and its jails have a combined capacity of nearly 17,000 inmates			0
however , @entity28 is in protective custody , meaning he is kept away from the general population because of his status as a high - profile inmate , said a department spokesman who asked not to be named			1
he is in @entity8 's @entity65 , part of which is used to house inmates with contagious diseases , but other parts are used for inmates in protective custody , the spokesman said			1
@entity28 is awakened at 6 a.m. each day in his 11 - by - 13 - foot cell , the spokesman said			1
he will not have interaction or contact with other inmates , and " his cell is the only one occupied on that side of the unit			0
" when he is taken out of his cell for his daily hour of recreation or taken to the visiting area to receive visitors , he will be accompanied by a corrections officer and a captain , the spokesman said			0
inmates travel outside their cells one at a time , meaning he will have no opportunity to encounter other inmates			0
the spokesman said monday that @entity28 will be allowed to leave his cell periodically and walk around his housing area corridor , where he can watch television -- but he still wo n't come into contact with anyone else			2
tuesday 's menu for inmates included an apple , banana , cereal , toast , milk and coffee or tea for breakfast ; vegetable chili , rice , green beans , carrot and celery salad and wheat bread for lunch ; and veal patties , noodles , steamed cabbage , whole wheat bread , a piece of fruit and tea or a fruit drink for dinner			0
inmates and others can deposit money into their commissary accounts , which can be used to purchase toiletries , snacks and haircuts , as well as buy daily phone calls , all of which are monitored and recorded , according to the department			1
@entity28 will be allowed three visits a week , not counting his attorney or outside doctor , if he has one , the spokesman said			2
