-- celebrity chef @entity1 hopes the @entity3 's ruling allowing same - sex marriage to be legal in @entity5 will help in her defense against a racial discrimination lawsuit			1
the woman alleging that she was subjected to a hostile work environment while working as an assistant manager at @entity1 's restaurants is white and therefore does n't have the " standing , " or legal right , to claim racial discrimination , according to a motion filed monday by @entity1 's lawyer			1
the high court rejected an appeal of @entity5 's @entity19 law last week on the grounds that the private parties behind the appeal did not have standing to defend the ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state - sanctioned wedlock			1
even if the federal judge in @entity29 , @entity30 , accepts the argument and tosses the lawsuit , much damage has already been done to @entity1 's career and businesses by the public fallout from a deposition in which she acknowledged using the " n - word			1
" chat : comfort food , uncomfortable topics asked by the lawyer taking the deposition if she had ever used the word , she said , " yes , of course			0
" she said she had probably used the racial slur when talking to her husband about " when a black man burst into the bank that i was working at and put a gun to my head " -- an incident that took place 30 years ago			0
asked if she had used it since then , she said , " i 'm sure i have , but it 's been a very long time			0
" she noted that circumstances have changed " since the ' 60s in the @entity59			0
" many of @entity1 's lucrative business relationships have crumbled in the wake of media coverage of the lawsuit			2
she has lost at least nine endorsements along with her @entity67 cooking show , and publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook has been canceled			0
@entity1 attorney @entity71 's motion , filed monday with the @entity72 in @entity29 , cited the june 26 @entity3 decision in @entity74 , the @entity5 case			1
" writing for the majority , chief justice @entity76 made this observation : @entity80 of the @entity81 confines the judicial power of federal courts to deciding actual ' cases ' or ' controversies , ' " the motion said			0
" one essential aspect of this requirement is that any person invoking the power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so			2
this requires the litigant to prove that he has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct , and is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision			0
" @entity99 law professor @entity98 told @entity0 tuesday the contention that the @entity19 ruling is relevant to the @entity1 case wo n't hold water			1
the concept of standing is hardly new , and the @entity3 bringing it into the spotlight in @entity74 does n't not advance @entity1 's motion to dismiss the case , @entity98 said			1
@entity1 's accuser : ' this has never been about the n - word ' @entity114 , the plaintiff in the suit against @entity1 is white , has no standing because she could n't have suffered " a personal and tangible harm " from hearing the " n - word " on the job , the @entity113 's , motion says			1
in the @entity19 case , state officials refused to pursue an appeal when a federal judge struck down the same - sex marriage ban			1
private citizens picked it up , ultimately to be told by the high court last week that they had no standing to do so			1
@entity129 is a former manager at @entity1 's restaurants in @entity29 , @entity30			2
she is suing @entity1 and her brother , @entity132 , alleging they committed numerous acts of violence , discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five - year employment at @entity1 's @entity142 and @entity143 and @entity144 eateries in @entity29			1
she gave a statement to @entity0 's @entity146 through her lawyer , @entity147 , on monday			0
" this lawsuit has never been about the n - word , " she said			0
" it is to address ms. @entity1 's patterns of disrespect and degradation of people that she deems to be inferior			2
i may be a white woman , but i could no longer tolerate her abuse of power as a business owner , nor her condonation of mr. @entity132 's despicable behavior on a day - to - day basis			2
i am what i am , and i am a human being that cares about all races , and that is why i feel it is important to be the voice for those who are too afraid to use theirs			0
" @entity1 's lawyer has called the allegations false , and @entity1 has said she does not tolerate prejudice			1
@entity1 made an emotional appearance on @entity173 's " @entity172 " last week in which she called the accusations " horrible , horrible lies			2
" " i believe that every creature on this @entity179 , every one of @entity181 's creatures , was created equal , " she said			0
" ... i believe that everyone ought to be treated equal			0
" @entity1 was raised to never be unkind to anyone , she said			0
opinion : we use @entity1 to give ourselves a pass @entity0 's @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 contributed to this report .			2
