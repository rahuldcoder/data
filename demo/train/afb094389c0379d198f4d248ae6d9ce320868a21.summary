-- when @entity2 filled out her census form last year , she checked the box for @entity5 , and for the first time , she also checked the box for @entity8			1
it had taken her more than 30 years -- plus research and genetic testing -- to discover her ties to the indigenous @entity14 of @entity15 , to claim her identity and re-learn what she thought she knew of her history			1
she 's not the only one			2
since 2000 , the number of @entity5 who identified themselves as @entity8 grew from 407,073 to 685,150 , according to the 2010 census			1
census : @entity5 drive growth of @entity26 white population some attribute the increase to immigration from parts of @entity31 where there are large indigenous populations			1
in some cases , it 's because of recently discovered ties to native cultures			2
growing up in the @entity39 , @entity40 , and spending summers in @entity15 , @entity38 said she had no words to identify who she was			1
she just felt " different			2
" how do you self - identify ? tell us in @entity48 's @entity47 " it is one thing to know that you have indigenous blood , " @entity38 said			2
" and i have always known it			2
i look at the faces of my mother and grandmother , and that reality is undeniable			0
" but @entity38 had long been taught that @entity14 , the indigenous people of @entity15 , were " gone , dead and buried " for centuries , decimated by @entity58 who arrived on the island in the 16th century			1
" why would you question what you have always been taught and what was considered as common knowledge ? " she asked			0
still , 14 years ago , @entity38 founded the @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 , to preserve the culture of indiginous @entity15			1
today , @entity38 gives dance and singing classes as a volunteer at the center , in addition to her full - time job as an engineer with @entity76			0
four years ago , @entity38 heard about the work of dr. @entity78 , a geneticist from the @entity79			0
in an island - wide genetic study , he found that at least 61.1 % of those surveyed had mitochondrial dna of indigenous origin			0
@entity78 's findings eventually cast doubt upon the notion that the @entity14 of @entity15 had been completely extinguished but suggested that they assimilated			1
" when i learned about ( @entity78 's ) work , my life changed , " @entity38 said			0
" it was an awakening that the @entity14 heritage was not extinct			1
" @entity93 how the @entity26 has changed for @entity38 , this was a living heritage to reclaim			1
months later , she took a dna test that confirmed she was @entity14 via her mother 's ancestry			1
" i walked through that door and for the first time had a deep understanding of who i was , " she said			0
despite diminished numbers -- the @entity14 population decreased from 8 million in 1492 to 20,000 in 1520 to 200 in 1560 -- the @entity14 culture has survived and is still present in the language today , said @entity107 , assistant director for research at the @entity109			1
" i am originally from @entity110 , and i like to say to my fellow @entity110 that @entity110 is a @entity14 word , " @entity107 said			1
" they have no idea that when they say the word @entity110 , they are speaking @entity117			0
it means ' big land , well - planted			0
' " @entity121 created the @entity122 in 2005 , a nonprofit organization dedicated to the research and preservation of indigenous cultures			0
it tries to educate people with indigenous roots who label themselves " @entity5 , " @entity121 said			0
the increasing number of people who identified as @entity5 and @entity8 in 2010 give him hope			1
" the @entity58 tried to destroy our civilization and history , outlawed our ceremonies , yet we are still here , " @entity121 said			0
" with a bigger group of @entity8 , we have a better chance of getting federal recognition and grants			2
" but for @entity38 , it was n't about gaining political power ; it was a way to acknowledge her newly discovered @entity14 heritage			1
her @entity47 form showed that the culture was still alive			0
in a sacred ceremony , @entity38 's priest gave her a consecrated @entity14 name : " @entity154 - eirú			2
" it means " sweet teacher			0
" the name is apt , @entity38 said , as she wants to teach the @entity14 culture to those that come to her cultural center			2
her two children will need to learn their own lessons about identity			0
she wants her children to know about what she yearned for : their roots .			0
