-- @entity2 's alleged mass killer testified on thursday that he played video games as a way to train for a shooting spree that killed 77 people last summer			1
in particular , @entity7 said at his trial that he played " call of duty : @entity10 " as a means of shooting practice , according to @entity0 's report			2
the confessed shooter also said he once played the online game " @entity17 , " a role - playing adventure with multiple players from around the world , for as many as 16 hours a day			1
for people who have long suspected that there is some link between violent video games and real - world violence , the statement offered frightening new evidence for why the video - game industry should be more strictly regulated			1
many gamers and columnists , however , rolled their eyes and collectively muttered " here we go again			2
" " how many times are we going to do this ? " @entity34 wrote in a @entity36 story , " the idiocy of blaming video games for the @entity2 massacre			1
" " really now , it 's getting absurd			0
" " @entity2 killer played @entity17 , @entity45 , " declared a headline on @entity43 , which shares a parent company with @entity0			1
whether shoot - ' em - up video games can incite violence has been a long - running debate among the public as well as in clinical psychology			1
this type of discussion tends to come up every time it 's revealed that a high - profile killer also played video games			1
perhaps the most memorable case study was the @entity57 shooting in @entity58 in 1999 , during which experts speculated about the influence of the game " @entity63 " on the teenagers who carried out that crime			0
and for years , the controversial " @entity69 " series , in which players can kill police officers , was targeted by critics who said it glamorizes criminals and promotes violence			2
the makers of the game were even sued by the attorney for a convicted cop killer in @entity77 , who argued the game inspired his client			0
ultimately , it seems like science should judge whether playing violent video games can lead to a propensity for violence in the real world			1
a number of recent studies have cast doubts about the link between video games and violence , but there 's no definitive answer			1
confusingly , a 2004 @entity93 and @entity95 report studied 24 cases of school violence and found : " over half of the attackers demonstrated some interest in violence , through movies , video games , books and other media			1
however , there was no one common type of interest in violence indicated			2
instead , the attackers ' interest in violent themes took various forms			0
" the always - vocal jury of the @entity115 , meanwhile , rushed on thursday to the defense of the video game industry			0
here 's a breakdown of the general argument , in case you want to be supercontrarian and appropriate these points for cocktail - party conversation this weekend			0
point 1 : lots of people play video games and do n't kill people			1
" how many subscribers do those two games have ? several million ? and yet several million of us managed not to go bonkers with a gun , " a commenter on my @entity136 page			0
" point 1.5 : lots of people who play " @entity140 " do n't actually farm			0
here 's a related point : people who play other kinds of video games do n't usually ( or ever ) act out the things they do in the games			1
" shooters do not create real - life killers			0
neither does " @entity140 " create real - life farmers , " another @entity136 commenter said			0
point 2 : the confessed @entity2 killer had other apparent influences			1
" if we 're looking for @entity7 's influences and motivations , we 'd better start with xenophobia , @entity159 and right - wing ideology before even mentioning what was in his @entity162 , " a commenter wrote on @entity0 's story about the trial			0
and from @entity171 on @entity136 : " if there were no violent video games or movies , would @entity164 have shrugged off writing his manifesto [ on ] his irrational fear of @entity170 ? no , then perhaps then if he 'd been unable to watch the news ? oops , now we have to keep him from using the @entity115 , was that enough ? " point 3 : there are lots of ways to train for a shooting spree			1
from a @entity36 column : " let 's say he did use ' @entity181 ' to help him train in some way			0
so what ? that may sound callous , but let 's be real here			0
if he went to a gun range every single day for the past year , a place that actually trains you how to hit person - shaped targets with a real gun firing real bullets in your hands , would we be talking about how shooting ranges are to blame ? would we want them all closed down for fear someone else might learn how to shoot a gun and kill someone ? some might , but they 'd be shouted down by gun rights activists , ironically many of whom would like to blame games instead			0
" point 3.5 : and anyway , these games would be crappy for training			0
" how can ' @entity17 ' be considered ' training ' ? unless he planned on looting gold and armor			2
also , ' @entity10 ' is hardly a training tool			2
too linear and unrealistic , " another @entity136 commenter wrote			0
" could the ' @entity215 ' series , with its more simulation based approach , have been more useful to create a mass murderer ? " point 4 : there 's little scientific evidence to suggest video games actually make people violent			1
from @entity43 : " the most up - to - date research , according to academic and @entity43 contributor @entity223 , ' has not found that children who play @entity226 [ violent video games ] are more violent than other kids , nor harmed in any other identifiable fashion			1
' in @entity223 's own longitudinal studies , recently published in the @entity232 , he found ' no long - term link between @entity226 and youth aggression or dating violence			0
' and @entity223 references another recent longitudinal study involving @entity239 children , published in @entity240 , which similarly found no links between increased aggression and violent video games			1
" point 5 : the @entity2 killer apparently saw " @entity17 " as a cover - up device			1
i 'll add this little factoid to the pile : if you search the manifesto that 's attributed to @entity7 , you 'll only find a few references to " @entity17			2
" when he does mention the game , he appears to be explaining that by saying if you 're playing " @entity17 " all the time , you can stop family members and friends from questioning what you 're up to			2
" announce to your closest friends , co-workers and family that you are pursuing a ' project ' that can at least partly justify your ' new pattern of activities ' ( isolation / travel ) while in the planning phase , " the manifesto says			0
" ( for ) example , tell them that you have started to play ' @entity17 ' or any other online mmo game and that you wish to focus on this for the next months / year			2
this ' new project ' can justify isolation and people will understand somewhat why you are not answering your phone over long periods			0
