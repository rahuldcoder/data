thirty miles from @entity2 's @entity1 , a small fishing village offers a contrasting view of the city 's past			1
located in the southwest corner of @entity7 , @entity2 's largest island , @entity8 is connected to the outside world via a narrow mountain road			1
it has a view contrary to expectations for one of the world 's most crowded cities : there are no skyscrapers , no neon signs or real estate companies			1
the few shops in village close at 5 p.m. , when the nightlife on @entity24 has yet to spark			0
in recent years , tourists have been flocking to @entity8 to glimpse this part of @entity2 's rapidly disappearing past			1
but when they arrive , they are greeted by a placard at the bus station decrying : " @entity31 development will destroy @entity8 " it 's a sign of the times : even as tourists boost the coffers of a local economy once dependent on fishing , villagers are deeply ambivalent about the hordes of visitors encroaching on their seaside hamlet			1
" we are going to lose our distinctive way of life and identity if no one protests against the government plan , " said lifelong @entity8 resident @entity42 , 51 , who runs the @entity8 culture workshop			1
" i am afraid that the commercially - driven plan is going to turn @entity8 into another resort			2
" villagers like @entity42 are torn by government plans to add fountains , sculptures and a stage next to the temple to @entity58 , where generations of fishermen prayed for safety before sailing			1
the government 's us $ 100 million " @entity65 " project will also replace patches of wetland by boardwalks and a new plaza will rise near the dock			2
the project is scheduled to be completed later this year , according to the @entity2 's @entity73 spokesperson @entity72			1
original plans called for tearing down all the village 's distinctive stilt houses , but was curtailed after protests by villagers			1
while the redevelopment celebrates @entity8 's seafaring heritage -- in 1960 , villagers caught 30 % of all seafood sold in @entity2 , according to the book " @entity88 " -- it comes in the wake of a 2012 @entity2 law banning of commercial trawling			1
that move was applauded by environmentalists but decried by local fishers			0
" it wrecks my heart to see fishermen forced to sell their large trawlers , " said a local fisherman surnamed @entity93 , who says he catches 70 % less after the ban			0
@entity93 , who sells homemade shrimp paste , now must import shrimp from mainland @entity101			0
@entity8 is separated from the rest of @entity2 by steep , rocky hills			1
before 1990 , the only way to get to @entity8 was by boat			2
permits to drive on the town 's single road are only granted to villagers and public buses			2
a sense of isolation still pervades the village 's tight - knit community , which many locals say they are keen to keep to themselves			0
as visitors are drawn to the @entity119 - like village with homes largely built on stilts , the pathways are dotted with signs warning " @entity122 " and " no entry			0
" to circumvent the signs , tour guides now row tourists on boat down the river and having a look at the houses from the water			0
besides tourism , real estate development could change the fortunes of the town , as @entity2 has one of the world 's most expensive real estate markets			1
yet villagers say they are actively working to keep property among themselves			0
" i ca n't tell you how many people are interested in our house , " said resident @entity142			0
but villagers do all their real estate business by word of mouth to keep outsiders out of the property market , @entity93 said			1
" the fact is that outsiders do n't know where to buy property at @entity8 and even if demand for @entity8 property is high , local people tend to sell to locals , " she said			1
@entity93 , 24 , grew up in @entity8 , but like many other young people here , was forced to find work in other parts of the city			1
she eventually moved to @entity165 , which sits across @entity166 from @entity24 , where she started working for a large bank			0
while she found it hard to leave her home , she said she had little choice			0
" @entity8 has no job market at all			2
i do n't see what i can do			0
selling salt fish with a degree in marketing ? " while @entity93 decries the impact of tourism , many of her peers who still live in @entity8 welcome the government tourism plan			2
" we are one of the oldest communities in @entity2			0
if @entity8 has nothing to offer to its young residents , it may become a dead town in a few years , " said @entity184 , 30 - year - old local resident			2
@entity184 landed on a job as a tourist guide last year			0
he makes 30 % less than a similar job in other parts of @entity2 , but he enjoys the commute - free work			1
before tourists poured in , the only local job @entity184 could find was temporary construction work			2
now young people start small business like transforming their stilt homes into guesthouses or waterfront caf√©s			0
" i think @entity8 has lost part of its unique character with all the development going on			2
but that the price we pay to get a better life and to help this community to survive , " he said			0
for @entity42 , the changes are attacking a way of life			0
" @entity8 people have deep feeling for the mountains , rivers and wetlands surrounding us , because we live so close to nature , " she said			1
" with the boardwalk , children lose a good place to find clams			0
