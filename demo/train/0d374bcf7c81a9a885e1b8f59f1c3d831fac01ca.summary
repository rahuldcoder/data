-- @entity1 shocked the sporting world , and perhaps even himself , by defeating two - time champion @entity3 at @entity4 , but the unknown @entity5 is not the first to have triumphed against seemingly impossible odds			1
the history of sport is littered with tales of underdogs toppling heavily - fancied favorites			2
but how is it that @entity1 , ranked 100th in the world and having won just 17 @entity14 matches prior to thursday , can rise to the occasion and defeat an 11 - time grand slam winner such as @entity3 ? @entity1 sends @entity3 crashing out of @entity4 " it 's always far easier to strive for a goal than achieve it , " tennis coach @entity17 explained to @entity0 when asked about how sport 's " @entity19 " can get the better of imposing " goliaths			1
" " it 's all mental , you either believe or you do n't , " he said			0
" truly believe and , as a result , you give yourself a real chance of both playing well and achieving victory in the moment			0
in the end , so few believe and just want to not get embarrassed			0
" @entity17 , the current director of coaching for @entity33 , believes the main difference between title - winning stars like second seed @entity3 and underachieving journeymen , such as the 26 - year - old @entity1 , is mentality and an innate belief in their own ability			1
who is @entity1 ? " champions really live in a different place than the rest - they dare to dream , " he said			1
" they have the courage to believe and the confidence to create			0
the result : they succeed			0
" in tennis , when any highly - ranked player is taken to five sets , or three in the women 's game , the lower - ranked player drops their level			1
in the end , they hand victory to the higher - rated player			2
" but @entity1 did not drop his level			2
the @entity4 singles debutant produced devastating strokes in the fifth set to pummel @entity3 into submission and reach the third round			1
his only other appearance on the hallowed grass courts ended in a first - round doubles defeat last year			2
the 26 - year - old 's bullish approached impressed observers all over the world , so is aggression the key to overcoming an imposing opponent ? " you do n't make top 100 or even the top 10 , let alone win a grand slam , by being aggressive all the time , " said @entity17 , who has worked extensively with stars such as @entity77 and @entity78			1
" the scoreboard rewards conservative decision - making , the court rewards percentage cross-court tennis			0
no different to golf -- getting up and down in two shots rather than hitting for the pin			0
the margins are just not there			0
" he played to win , backed himself and held his line at the critical time			0
it 's what you train for all your career , so when the moment arrives there should be nothing to fear as you have been preparing for this for years			0
" despite his scintillating performance , two tennis greats have questioned whether @entity1 can advance past his next match against @entity109 27th seed @entity107			1
eight - time grand slam champion @entity110 tweeted : " in â € ªtennis we call @entity1 a stopper , he wo n't win or even go deep in tournament but he will stop a top seed from advancing			1
" @entity1 's compatriot @entity115 , winner of 18 major singles titles , agreed : " happy for @entity1 , but really feeling bad for @entity3			1
would be shocked if @entity1 can get anywhere near that form again			2
" but @entity17 argues that speculation over @entity1 's chances in the rest of the tournament is irrelevant , and all that matters is celebrating his remarkable win			1
" who cares , sport is about on the day , on your merit , and @entity1 took his chance , he had a go and backed himself on the day and was rewarded			2
" it 's got nothing to do with how far he goes after that , only that on this day he lived his dreams , played to or above his potential and the moment rewarded him with a victory			0
" whether he believes in himself again or not , wins another round or not is irrelevant -- that 's sports as it is life			0

@entity1 beat **no.** 2 seed @entity3 in five sets at @entity4
the @entity5 world **no.** 100 had only *previously* won 17 matches on the @entity14
@entity33 coach @entity17 believes success is down to mentality and self - belief
@entity110 and @entity115 doubt @entity1 can build on his win
