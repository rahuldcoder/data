as @entity1 remains in isolation at a hospital in @entity4 , and @entity6 journalist @entity5 prepares to be transported home , many are wondering : will they receive an experimental drug like other @entity10 patients treated in the @entity6 ? dr. @entity11 and @entity12 received an experimental serum called @entity14 , engineered from antibodies harvested in mice			1
questions remain about the extent to which @entity14 was responsible for the patients ' recovery , but demand for the drug has skyrocketed			2
unfortunately , the process used to make the doses given to @entity11 , @entity12 and a few other patients is costly and time - consuming			2
public health officials are now looking for ways to develop more of this experimental drug quickly			1
tobacco plants may hold the key			1
in the world of health and medicine , the word tobacco usually brings to mind cancer , emphysema and heart disease			1
but in recent years the plant 's tarnished reputation is getting a makeover from the development of pharmaceuticals through an effective , swift and cost - cutting technique that has been dubbed " biopharming			0
" tobacco plant - based drugs are not a new concept			1
but there are no treatments currently developed through tobacco plants that have been approved by the @entity51			1
that may change as the deadly ebola virus continues to spread through @entity54 , where it has killed more than 3,300			0
@entity56 in @entity57 was one of the first biopharmaceutical companies tasked with developing the @entity14 serum through tobacco plants			1
the company has been working in collaboration with @entity65 - based @entity64 , which developed the @entity14 vaccine , since august			1
eyes have also turned to @entity69 - based biotechnology company @entity68 , which that same month claimed it was ready to fast - track the drug if need be			0
the company , which says it operates the largest tobacco - based pharmaceutical facility in the world , has been working on cutting costs and increasing quantities of certain cancer drugs through genetically modified tobacco			1
drugs and vaccines are manufactured in a variety of ways			1
flu vaccines , for example , are most commonly produced by injecting fertilized hen eggs with the virus			1
the virus is incubated for days so it can replicate , be harvested , inactivated or weakened , and then made into either a flu shot or nasal spray			0
the process can cost around $ 150 million each year , using $ 600,000 eggs each day			0
tobacco plants can produce antibodies in much less time for a fraction of the cost , advocates say			1
the process begins by cloning a gene and inserting it into a virus			0
that infected gene is then injected into the tobacco plant , where it multiplies within the leaves before it is extracted and purified			2
unlike with egg - based and mammalian cell - based products , each tobacco plant can produce enough antibodies for dozens of doses of a pharmaceutical , experts say			2
the plants are also easy to contain and manufacture in controlled environments such as greenhouses			2
@entity113 , a biopharmaceutical company in @entity114 , produced 10 million flu vaccines in 30 days using tobacco plants in a federally funded effort called " @entity118			1
" the program tested the prospect of rapid vaccine production in the hypothetical case of a global health pandemic			0
it is estimated the company could make as many as 100 million doses for as little as $ 36 million			0
the @entity128 biopharmaceutical company @entity127 is using tobacco to produce a drug that reduces the growth rate of breast cancer tumors			2
the drug is a " biosimilar " form of a current drug on the market called @entity137 , usually produced by creating antibodies in mammalian cells from hamsters ' ovaries			0
the current treatment costs up to $ 100,000 per patient , according to @entity127			0
the company estimates up to $ 120 million could be saved by 2017 by manufacturing the drug with tobacco plants instead			1
one of the pioneering programs to use tobacco for vaccine manufacturing is the @entity150 's @entity149 in @entity151			2
since 2007 , it has used a relative of tobacco , called nicotiana benthamiana , to develop vaccines for everything from cholera to cervical cancer			1
in august , the center announced it had received a $ 14.7 million grant to produce a gel made from crushed tobacco leaves that prevents @entity165 transmission			2
the process involves isolating a protein called griffithsin , which can be found in red algae			0
the protein fends off @entity165 by sticking onto the outer surface of an @entity165 - infected cell , shielding noninfected cells from the virus			0
once isolated , the protein is injected into the tobacco plant and then extracted 12 days later			2
it is then crushed , purified and mixed into a gel that can be used as a lubricant			0
" our hope is for the gel to be as effective as the condom , " senior scientist dr. @entity179 said			0
@entity179 , a native of @entity183 , has been studying plant - based pharmaceuticals since 1997 when he received his doctorate at the @entity187 in @entity188			0
before working with tobacco , @entity179 studied the prospects of using corn to develop pharmaceuticals			1
but while edible plants are just as well - suited as tobacco for biopharming , @entity179 said they are not the way to go : " you do n't want to risk contaminating the food supply with pharmaceuticals			1
" your @entity10 questions answered one company learned that the hard way			1
in 2002 , @entity203 , a biopharmaceutical company based out of @entity204 , @entity69 , was fined $ 3 million after a corn - produced vaccine for diabetes and diarrhea nearly contaminated a crop of soybeans in @entity210 and @entity211			0
the incident ignited a massive backlash against the development of plant - based pharmaceuticals , and the @entity51 and @entity6 @entity216 implemented new and stricter regulations for field - testing of pharmaceuticals engineered through food crops			2
to date , there is only one plant - based pharmaceutical approved by the @entity51 : @entity224 , which contains an enzyme engineered through carrot cells			0
the medication treats @entity229 's disease , a rare genetic disorder that stops cells and organs from functioning properly			0
@entity179 does n't blame the @entity51 for the bottleneck in biopharmaceutical approval			0
rather , he concedes that compared with competing technology used to make pharmaceuticals , biopharming is still relatively new			0
he sees the success of @entity14 as a big catalyst for movement in the industry : " @entity243 as it is , the @entity10 epidemic in @entity54 is a huge leg up for the field , " @entity179 said			1
" i think it will only help validate the technology as a viable option			0
" complete coverage on @entity10			1

experimental serum used to treat @entity10 being developed using tobacco plants
" @entity255 , " using plants to develop drugs and vaccines , is a *fairly* new field
advocates say using tobacco plants is *cheaper* and faster than *traditional* *methods*
