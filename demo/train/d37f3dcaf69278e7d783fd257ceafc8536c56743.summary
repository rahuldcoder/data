@entity0 -- when it comes to animal exploitation -- follow the money			1
using animals for entertainment is big business , plain and simple			2
the killer whale @entity9 has helped @entity10 sell millions of dollars worth of tickets			1
in the process this highly intelligent , social creature has gone through what we can only assume is hell			2
the hell is called confinement			2
veteran whale trainer @entity19 was killed february 22 when the 12,300 - pound killer whale dragged her into a tank at the park and held her underwater long enough to drown her			1
it happened in front of a crowd , just as she was rubbing the whale after a show			1
as talking heads debate this avoidable tragedy , few pause to reflect on where it all started			2
it began in the oceans off @entity35			0
that 's where @entity9 was born			0
he was born free , free to swim up to 100 miles a day , as killer whales are known to do in the wild			1
his idyllic life turned into a living hell in 1983			0
that 's when he was captured			0
capture of a wild animal is invariably traumatic			1
he was put in a small pen			1
after a stint in a @entity48 aquarium that ended in tragedy when a trainer was killed by @entity9 and two other whales , the animal was transferred to @entity10 in @entity52 , @entity53			1
first a man who sneaked into @entity10 was found dead on @entity9 's back			1
now , the experienced trainer is dead -- a horrific and violent death			1
@entity59 : see photos of moments before the incident @entity9 has spent more than a quarter of a century swimming in circles , in a space that critics say would be equivalent to keeping a human being in a bathtub			2
would you get resentful , angry , maybe even a little rageful and psychotic if you were kept in a bathtub - sized tank forced to swim in circles for more than 25 years ? the time has come to free @entity9			0
@entity73 and @entity74 are just two countries that have created huge coastal sanctuaries , some running thousands of miles , where whales like @entity9 can return to an active life , one in which they can frolic and explore			0
this is how nature intended these creatures to live			0
zoos and animal amusement attractions use the cover of " science " to justify their shows			2
getting a whale to splash kids with water is not science			2
@entity10 says it supports wildlife conservation , research and education and has rescued thousands of stranded and sick animals			1
while many of the handlers are undoubtedly well - intentioned and love the animals , the fact is that parks such as @entity10 are money - making operations			1
there are many ways to help save the whales			0
organizations like @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , the @entity112 and -- yes -- @entity113 all campaign in various ways to stop the decimation of whales and other intelligent creatures of the sea			0
@entity10 needs to stop using @entity9 to breed			1
he 's reportedly sired 17 calves , some of which have not survived			0
those that do survive become part of the system of exploitation for profit			0
nature did not put whales on this earth to splash kids while stuck in a pen			0
this is the 21st century			0
it is time to change			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity138 .			1

an experienced trainer was killed by a whale at @entity10
@entity138 says the animal was unnaturally confined to a relatively small space
she says the killer whale should be released in a *marine* sanctuary
