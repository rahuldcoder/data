-- all a summer camp used to need to keep kids entertained throughout the warmer months was a good ball field and a place to go swimming			1
now , though , campers can while away their summer days doing all sorts of specialized camping			1
let 's take a look at some camps that appeal to kids with very specific interests			1
@entity14 finally , there 's a solution for kids who do n't want to leave their role - playing games for a week at camp : a camp that is one big rpg			1
at @entity25 , @entity24 ' @entity23 , campers create their own characters and then spend their days fighting together against villains and searching for treasure			0
the camp sounds like it integrates educational elements into the fun -- a potions - making class provides real - world lessons on chemistry -- all while giving children a valuable opportunity to mingle with trolls			1

@entity40 since the early 1990s , the @entity41 has offered summer @entity42 at various resorts around the country in order to let young people ages 11 to 18 enjoy some nude summer camp fun			1
while the notion of a camp full of naked teenagers may strike non-nudists as a bit strange ( or completely appalling ) , a 2003 @entity54 profile detailed how the camps were perfectly legal because the nudity was n't of a lewd nature			1
( the camps go to great lengths to desexualize the nudity in an effort to combat the teens ' surging hormones			1
) the result : camps where teens go to enjoy mundane activities like sports and arts and crafts , all while in the buff			2
the clothes - free policy certainly must make packing for camp easier			2
@entity75 @entity77 's @entity76 offers a number of camps for the show - biz hopeful , but their @entity75 sounds like it would be particularly fun			2
campers spend either one of two weeks working with real @entity83 stuntmen on topics like taking a high fall , simulating hand - to - hand combat , and sword fighting			0
( seems like a good idea			0
kids are inevitably going to sword fight , so you might as well make it safe			2
) the two - week program even culminates with campers taking a 32 - foot fall and directing and choreographing their own stunt spectacular			0
if heights and fights are n't your thing , @entity97 also offers a @entity102 where campers work with @entity83 makeup artists to replicate favorite movie characters and even turn themselves into gory ghouls			0

@entity108 @entity110 's @entity109 offers an unusual opportunity for rising high school juniors and seniors to get some experience in the fast - paced world of securities trading			0
the weeklong @entity108 lets students act as traders in the school 's electronic trading lab and learn the intricacies of the @entity122 , @entity123 , and other trading floors around the world			2
@entity126 do your kids want to become the next @entity129 ? send them to archaeology camp at @entity132 's @entity131			1
the center 's three - week @entity133 gives high school students the opportunity to excavate dig sites alongside the pros and help analyze what they find			0
campers also get the opportunity to try their hand at many of tasks of the @entity145 they 're studying , including starting a fire by hand			0
@entity0 : are tomatoes fruits or vegetables ? 6			0
@entity150 think your kid might want to be a firefighter ? here 's a great way to find out			0
junior firefighting camps are available around the country for kids of all ages who want to learn the ins and outs of fighting and preventing fires			1
some , like @entity164 's @entity163 , are even more extremely specialized ; @entity165 teaches young women ages 14 to 20 about topics like ventilation , dumpster fires , and forcible entry			2
@entity0 : @entity171 day at the @entity172 7			0
@entity173 @entity174 in @entity132 offers a variety of day camp for the ( very ) young aspiring businessman			2
the center 's offerings include " running your own biz , " a camp for third or fourth graders who are interested in starting their own businesses , and " @entity187 , " which gives fifth and sixth graders the skinny on running their own businesses			2
something 's telling us that @entity132 's lemonade stands are run more efficiently than those in surrounding states thanks to these camps			2
@entity198 what kid does n't want to be a secret agent ? @entity201 in @entity203 's @entity202 fills this niche by offering @entity198			1
aspiring @entity205 learn evasive driving maneuvers for @entity207 , martial arts , undercover tactics , and code breaking skills			1
at the end of the term , campers test their spying acumen by participating in a recon and rescue mission			0
@entity216 the @entity217 bills itself as the best magic camp in @entity219 , and since we 'd rather not be sawed in half , we wo n't challenge them			1
professional magicians @entity223 and @entity225 use their day camp to teach kids showmanship , misdirection , and the other tricks of the magic trade			1
at this camp , every arts and crafts section yields something useful ; campers build their own props and then use them in a final show to cap off the week			0
@entity0 : @entity239 found photos of life during wartime 10			0
@entity243 if your main beef with summer camp was that it was just too much fun , the @entity244 of @entity245 and @entity246 will be right up your alley			1
who needs kickball or arts and crafts when you can take part in a weeklong day camp with sessions with titles like , " @entity260 , " " giving and receiving compliments , " " posture , " and " @entity263 " ? the goal of the camp is to " help children become more self - confident and courteous			0
" this year 's camp ended on july 2 , but kids , it 's not too early to start pestering your parents to sign you up for next year ! @entity0 : a brief history of wiffle ball			1

even kids summer camps are getting more specialized
@entity280 , @entity216 or @entity14 camp for *imaginary* times
