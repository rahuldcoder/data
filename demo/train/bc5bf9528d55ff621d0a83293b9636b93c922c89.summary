-- @entity1 weekend appears to have scared off the major movie studios : none of them released a new film , perhaps figuring folks were more interested in parties and trick - or - treating			2
it seems they were right , as the holiday turned cineplexes into ghost towns			0
" @entity16 , " a dark thriller starring @entity18 , was the only new movie to open in the top 10 , taking in $ 10.9 million			1
@entity18 plays a creepy freelance cameraman determined to ride the local tv news trend of " if it bleeds , it leads " to success			0
weekend estimates showed " @entity16 , " from @entity24 , barely edging last weekend 's champ , the horror flick " @entity27 , " whichever film winds up on top , it 'll be the lowest - grossing no. 1 movie since " @entity32 " topped the chart with just $ 10.4 million in early september in its sixth weekend in release			1
if " @entity16 " squeezes out the win , it 'll be the lowest - grossing no. 1 debut in more than two years , when " @entity38 " opened with just $ 9.3 million			1
both of those low - grossing number ones occurred on the weekend after @entity41 , traditionally one of the poorest box office weekends of the year			1
this weekend 's other new wide release , " @entity46 , " opened outside the top 10 , as expected			0
@entity47 stars as a woman who wakes up every morning with her memory erased			0
that 's an eerie similarity to @entity47 's career of late , continuing a pattern of quickly - forgotten films : " trespass , " " @entity55 " " @entity56 , " and " @entity57			1
" even a special @entity1 re-release of the original " @entity59 , " the 2004 movie that helped spark the current horror - as - torture - porn genre , could n't lure many fans			2
@entity64 and his victims averaged a pathetic $ 315 per theater			0
strange -- it 's as if people looking for scary stuff had something else to do this weekend .			0

" @entity16 " appears to edge ' @entity27 ' for no. 1 by a razor - thin *margin*
@entity18 thriller would be the lowest - grossing no. 1 debut in two years
@entity47 continues her string of flops with " @entity46 "
" saw " re-release failed to lure fans back into @entity64 's traps
