-- the @entity1 announced tuesday that " @entity3 " producer @entity2 will not be allowed to attend the march 7 awards show because of an e-mail that has been deemed in violation of the @entity1 's campaigning standards			1
" @entity2 had recently disseminated an e-mail to certain @entity1 voters and other film industry figures in which he solicited votes for his own picture and disparaged one of the other contending films , " the @entity1 said in a statement tuesday evening			1
according to the @entity17 , @entity2 's e-mail asked the message recipients to spread the word about the @entity21 war movie so that the independent feature would win , " and not a $ 500m film , " which many have interpreted as a slight against @entity26 's box - office blockbuster " @entity27			0
" to the @entity1 , @entity2 's appeal to voters and industry insiders crossed the line by " casting a negative or derogatory light on a competing film , " which , according to the @entity1 's statement , is against the organization 's rules			2
late monday , the @entity1 decided that it would rescind only @entity2 's invitation , " stopping short " of pulling " the @entity3 " out of the running altogether			2
if the film wins , remaining producers @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 will accept the award			0
@entity2 would receive his @entity44 statuette later .			0

@entity2 wo *n't* be allowed to attend *ceremony*
@entity1 rescinded invitation to @entity49 because of e-mail campaign
e-mail , sent to @entity44 voters and others , was *considered* negative toward another film
