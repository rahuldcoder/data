-- @entity1 scored a last - gasp equalizer to deny @entity3 a victorious @entity5 debut in @entity6 on tuesday			1
the 1 - 1 draw left all four teams in @entity9 on one point after @entity11 held defending champions @entity13 to the same score on monday night			1
a 50th - minute goal from striker @entity16 in @entity17 had seemed set to settle a clash between two of the tournament 's smaller nations -- @entity3 has a population of around 5.4 million ; @entity1 has about 4.3 million people			1
but a stubborn @entity1 side , returning to soccer 's biggest stage for the first time since their debut in 1982 , hit back in the third minute of time added on to secure the nation 's first - ever point from their fourth @entity5 finals game			1
defender @entity34 , who had been beaten in the air by @entity16 for the opening goal , ghosted in behind the @entity38 defense to glance a header from @entity41 's cross into the net off the base of the post			1
@entity13 stutter to draw with @entity11 it was a bitter blow for the @entity48 side -- which gained independence from the former @entity50 in 1993 -- after having dominated the second period			2
" it is just a nightmare			0
we could have had three points , and at the end it felt like we have lost the match , " @entity54 told @entity55			0
his coach @entity60 added : " during the match we were the better team , it is just a pity we did not take the opportunities we had			2
" the mood in the dressing room is very sad but that is football			0
we have to cope with the sadness and i hope we will perform well in the next match			0
" " we are very , very proud			0
you would have to say this is our best ever result			0
we have never picked up a point in a @entity5 before			2
we have come and thrown some extremely good punches and got what i thought was a fully deserved result			0
" @entity1 coach @entity77 went to the finals in @entity79 28 years ago , where his team lost to @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			2
" we are very , very proud			0
you would have to say this is our best - ever result , " he told @entity55			0
" we have come and thrown some extremely good punches and got what i thought was a fully deserved result			0
" @entity1 had the better chances of the first half as @entity93 failed to test @entity94 with an early close - range header and then fellow striker @entity41 fired a stinging shot that the goalkeeper turned into the sidenetting			1
the @entity99 , known as the " @entity1 , " mixed battling defense with some shaky moments at the back as goalkeeper @entity103 was lucky to escape after a complete miskick and some ineffectual attempts to clear crosses			1
and it was the aerial route that provided @entity3 's breakthrough five minutes after halftime as @entity16 managed to evade @entity34 and head home a cross by @entity112			1
@entity34 made a goal - saving challenge on @entity115 in the 69th minute , and @entity3 's failure to capitalize on their possession gave @entity1 the chance to mount a late assault			1
@entity41 , the top scorer in the @entity121 a-league , should have found the target with a header in the 88th minute but made amends when he curled a tantalizing cross towards @entity34 in injury - time			1
@entity1 next play @entity13 in @entity126 on sunday , when @entity3 face @entity11 at @entity127 in @entity128 .			2

@entity34 heads injury - time equalizer to give @entity1 first point at any @entity5
