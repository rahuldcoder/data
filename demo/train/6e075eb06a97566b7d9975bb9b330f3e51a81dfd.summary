-- so now the world knows that @entity2 likes to shop			2
in a detailed essay in @entity6 , the famous writer confessed to spending more than $ 600,000 in the past two years			0
" is this for real ? " -- you may wonder			0
could a man be so into clothing he would shell out that much money to worship at the temple of @entity13 ? believe it or not , shopping can be an addiction			1
upwards of 6 % of the @entity19 adult population shops compulsively , and most are women			1
it tends to start early in the teen years or early 20s , and it can rapidly become chronic			1
for some people , shopping is a major leisure activity			1
for others , it can be like nicotine , alcohol or other drugs			0
in other words , those addicted to shopping find it difficult or even impossible to quit			1
these are the compulsive shoppers whose lives are organized around a variety of shopping experiences			1
@entity39 may or may not fit the bill , but he acknowledges his shopping is a problem : " it is n't drugs or gambling ... but there are similarities			1
" most compulsive shoppers are ordinary people , although the problem has been noted among the rich and powerful for hundreds of years			1
famous examples include : -- @entity53 , during the turbulent time before the @entity52 , was known for her extravagances			0
-- @entity55 had spending binges that greatly distressed her husband			0
-- publisher and magnate @entity58 had an insatiable appetite for art and antiques that nearly drove him to bankruptcy during the @entity65 in the 1930s			0
-- @entity67 , known for her personal charm and great fashion sense , was an obsessive shopper whose uncontrolled behavior dismayed both of her husbands			0
some might assume compulsive shopping is relatively recent -- perhaps a product of @entity75			1
but the disorder has always been around , manifesting itself in various forms			0
it is also found worldwide , except perhaps among the world 's poor			2
it is a clinical disorder ? compulsive shopping was described over a century ago by @entity85 psychiatrist @entity84			1
even today , his description remains fresh			0
apart from the dated language , it could have been written yesterday			0
its hallmark is excessive shopping and spending behavior that leads to a sense of personal distress			2
it often impairs a person 's life in some way ( finances , marriage , family )			2
@entity103 shoppers have reported experiencing a sense of tension or anxiety before buying and feeling a sense of relief after a purchase			1
they tend to spend many hours each week shopping and spending			2
most tend to focus on clothes and shoes and seem to be intensely interested in fashion and design			0
compulsive shopping has little to do with income , though money does determine the shopping venue			1
ordinary @entity121 , for example , shop compulsively at discount stores rather than @entity123			2
and because the @entity127 allows shopping 24/7 , its impact on shopping addiction can be considerable			1
most compulsive shoppers have other problems as well , including depression , anxiety or other addictions , including compulsive sexual behavior , internet addiction or compulsive gambling			1
these disorders " travel " together , so to speak			0
there is no special " shopping " personality , though i hear patients from time to time say they have an " addictive " personality			2
the good news is that we know a lot more about compulsive shopping than 20 years ago			1
the bad news is that we have no standard treatments			0
that said , cognitive therapy as pioneered by dr. april @entity151 can be effective in curbing shopping appetites			1
to those who call seeking advice , i tell them : do n't shop alone and get rid of your credit cards and checkbooks			0
for those who shop on the @entity127 , either stop your internet service or put your home computer in the kitchen or other place where family members can see it and will try to temper your enthusiasm			0
you must try and find other meaningful ways to spend your time			2
get to it ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0
