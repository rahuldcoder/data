-- over the past week , two popular @entity2 messaging companies , @entity3 and @entity4 , were hacked			1
@entity3 's 4.6 million users ' user names and cell phone numbers were posted online			1
a hacker group posted messages to @entity4 's official blog and social media accounts			1
these are just the latest in a long list of tech companies that fail to provide adequate protection of their users ' personal data			1
do companies that offer free services have an obligation to protect our communications ? yes , absolutely			1
@entity3 is an app for phones that allows people to send photos and short videos to friends and promises to delete them once viewed , @entity29			1
in august 2013 , a group of security researchers publicly reported weaknesses in @entity3 's programming interfaces that could allow data exfiltration and manipulation			1
they withheld the specific details that would enable someone to easily exploit the flaws			0
if you 're mad at your critics , you might ignore them and quietly fix the flaws			0
if you 're appreciative you might engage them in a dialogue , thank them and work out some time to fix things before telling the public about it			0
but it seems the founders of @entity3 chose instead to stick their heads in the sand			2
after four months without response , the security researchers grew impatient and decided to publicly disclose the details on christmas day , including code they had written that would allow almost anyone to abuse @entity3 's service			1
@entity3 then blogged that it knew about the flaws , but was satisfied with the changes it implemented and did n't expect the service to be exploited			2
the next day someone posted the user names and phone numbers of the 4.6 million snapchat users that they had extracted using the security weaknesses			1
while some can make excuses for @entity3 by saying the company is young , hence inexperienced , a breach is still a breach			1
@entity4 , a division of @entity75 , ca n't even say that			2
@entity4 had the dubious distinction of being the first major internet company to be compromised in 2014			2
it is the latest victim of a group called the @entity81 , which has targeted numerous media companies over the years , including @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			0
with more than 3 million followers on @entity90 and 27 million " likes " on its @entity93 page , you would expect the security of a company like @entity4 to be carefully managed			1
how did this so - called electronic army penetrate its defenses ? it must have been an extremely sophisticated hack , right ? unfortunately , the answer is no. the @entity81 is famous for using phishing , a simple tool that persuades users to disclose their user names and passwords through cleverly worded e-mails			1
the primary defense against phishing , aside from never clicking suspicious links or attachments in e-mails , is to use two - factor authentication			0
the first factor is something we know , typically a password			0
by adding a second factor -- something you have such as a phone or special keychain token -- attackers not only must acquire your password , but also gain access to a piece of randomly generated information sent to a physical device			0
the social media accounts of @entity4 that were accessed by the @entity81 had optional two - factor authentication available , but it was apparently not enabled by @entity4			2
as a result , @entity4 's blog featured a headline : " hacked by @entity81 ... stop spying ! " similar messages were posted on its @entity90 and @entity93 pages			1
@entity4 acknowledged in a tweet : " you may have noticed our social media properties were targeted today			2
no user info was compromised			0
we 're sorry for the inconvenience			0
" but @entity3 's response to the incident is shameful			1
the company attempted to justify its mistake and promised it will change the app to allow opting - out of one feature without any acknowledgment of the damage done to its users or even a commitment to fixing the list of problems identified by the researchers			0
if this was 2012 , i might be a little more forgiving			0
back then most services did n't offer protections like two - factor authentication or those protections were not flexible enough to work for social media accounts			0
all of these social media services offer protection free , designed to prevent this very type of attack			0
did n't skype think the 27 million people who " liked " them on @entity93 and the more than 3 million people who follow them on @entity90 deserve to be protected from potentially malicious posts ? companies that ca n't seem to get enough of our personal information need to be held accountable			2
the least they can do is be responsible and keep our data safe			0
the safeguards exist and the tech fixes are not hard			1
so , what are they waiting for ? for consumers , do n't become complacent to the barrage of announcements explaining how another 5 million records were stolen due to negligence			0
join the conversation on @entity93			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

@entity3 's 4.6 million user names and cell phone numbers were posted online
@entity187 : safeguards exists and tech fixes are easy , so why the breach ?
he says @entity4 , snapchat have obligation to make sure their services are secure
@entity187 : we must demand accountability from companies to protect our *private* data
