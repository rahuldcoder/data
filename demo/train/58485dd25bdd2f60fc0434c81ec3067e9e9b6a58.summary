@entity0 -- you can describe it as a political convention or a carnival , but either way , all eyes are on the @entity8 this week			1
the three - day event -- better known by its initials , @entity8 -- kicks off thursday at @entity11 , a major convention center just outside of the nation 's capital			1
the conference is the largest annual gathering of conservative leaders and activists , and when there 's no @entity19 in the @entity20 , it 's a must - attend cattle call for @entity19 presidential hopefuls looking to pass the conference 's conservative litmus test			1
@entity8 will close saturday with the much - watched results of the confab 's @entity19 presidential nomination straw poll			1
" after the @entity31 and the two parties ' national conventions , @entity8 is the most covered event in the country , " @entity28 , chairman of the @entity29 , the organization that puts on the conference , told @entity1			1
latest developments " it 's the only venue where thousands of activists get to see , back to back during our three - day conference , the likely 2016 leading @entity19 presidential candidates and begin to create perceptions which last through @entity43			1
" among those addressing the crowd this year are nearly all the major names among the potential 2016 @entity19 @entity20 contenders			1
they include sens. @entity49 of @entity50 , @entity51 of @entity52 , @entity53 of @entity54 , and rep. @entity55 of @entity56 , the 2012 @entity19 vice presidential nominee			2
@entity65 of @entity54 , who ran for the @entity19 nomination in 2012 , @entity60 of @entity61 and @entity62 of @entity63 , who was n't invited last year because he was n't considered conservative enough			1
inside politics : will @entity8 be launch of @entity69 ? former sen. @entity70 of @entity71 , who also ran for the @entity20 in 2012 , and former @entity73 gov. @entity72 , who made a bid for the nomination in 2008 , are addressing the audience			2
and do n't forget about former @entity78 gov. and 2008 @entity19 vice presidential nominee @entity79 and @entity80 , who seem to be flirting with 2016 bids			1
" the reason so many presidential hopefuls come to @entity8 is because they get to take a measure of themselves before an activist audience , and that audience gets to take its measure of the potential candidates , " @entity19 communications strategist @entity82 told @entity1			1
" @entity8 still provides both the contenders and the pretenders these opportunities , " added @entity82 , a senior vice president at @entity91 , a @entity0 , pr firm that has had many conservative clients			1
@entity19 strategist @entity96 says this year 's colder and snowier - than - normal winter in the @entity0 area wo n't keep conservatives away			1
" thousands of people trek to snow - and ice - covered @entity0 for three days to listen to @entity19 leaders preach the gospel to the faithful			1
i 'd call that relevant			0
it 's a good platform to keep the @entity19 base , and many young people , energized and charged up , " said @entity107 , a @entity1 contributor			1
@entity8 changes mind , wo n't allow atheist group at conference @entity8 has its critics some conservatives say that @entity8 has become too mainstream			1
" i think @entity8 is really @entity115 these days and is as much , if not more , lobbyist oriented than grass - roots oriented			2
it is like church homecoming for the @entity19 , wrote @entity120 , co-founder of @entity121 and a leading voice on the right			2
and rep. @entity124 , an outspoken conservative from @entity126 , said in a prepared statement that he " will neither speak at nor attend the @entity8			1
" instead , @entity124 will join other conservatives in addressing a @entity129 being held just a few blocks away from @entity8			2
spotlight on @entity62 while most of the major potential 2016 contenders will address @entity8 , two will be absent : former @entity52 gov. @entity134 had previous business commitments , and gov. @entity136 of @entity56 has events to attend in his home state			1
both spoke at @entity8 last year			2
while the spotlight 's on the speeches in the main ballroom , for the possible @entity20 hopefuls , some of the real action is away from the cameras , in private meetings with top activists , strategists and rainmakers			2
one of those possible presidential contenders is @entity62			0
the pragmatic @entity63 governor , never popular with many in the party 's conservative base , was not invited to last year 's conference			2
@entity8 organizers said @entity62 was snubbed because some of his positions were not conservative enough			2
are controversies helping @entity62 with conservatives ? @entity62 is currently awash in allegations that some of his aides closed access lanes to the @entity168 last september to punish the mayor of @entity170 , @entity63 , for not endorsing @entity62 's re-election			0
the governor has denied knowing anything about the gridlock until after it occurred and has said he knew nothing about any political mischief by members of his administration			0
while one tea party leader told @entity1 he was " stunned " that @entity62 was invited this year , @entity28 , the @entity29 chairman , said the national media coverage of the controversies in @entity63 might help @entity62 with the party 's base , which does n't like to see @entity19 attacked by the media , adding that the episode 's made conservatives " kindred spirits with gov. @entity62			1
" while many conservatives may not be @entity62 fans , they like the mainstream media even less			0
" i think @entity62 is going to get a good reception , maybe even better than he would have before the bridge thing			0
he 's a good , engaging , energetic speaker			0
he 's been under attack by mainstream media and @entity201 everywhere			0
the enemy of my enemy is my friend , " added @entity107 , the @entity19 strategist			0
@entity206 scrutiny the results of the @entity8 straw poll are analyzed and scrutinized on tv and online			0
but the idea that the results are any kind of barometer of what will actually happen in the battle for the @entity19 nomination are extremely debatable			0
but the straw poll is useful			0
" the straw poll is still more of a scrimmage of expectations			0
beat the expectations , and you can generate a lot of buzz among the media and activists , " said @entity220 , a @entity19 strategist , @entity1 contributor and senior adviser to @entity223 in the former @entity226 governor 's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns			1
in 2007 , @entity223 , considered in tune with conservative activists at the time , made winning at @entity8 a priority			1
and he met expectations with a straw poll victory			0
he won again in 2008 , narrowly edging out eventual @entity19 presidential nominee sen. @entity238 of @entity239 , who was not a favorite of the conservative base			2
@entity223 won even though he ended his bid for the @entity19 nomination on the first day of the conference			2
then - rep. @entity245 of @entity54 won the straw poll in 2010 and 2011 , in between his two bids for the @entity19 nomination			0
his victories were proof of the strong libertarian influence on the @entity8 straw poll			0
@entity223 won in 2012 , as he was battling two more conservative candidates : @entity70 and former house speaker @entity253			0
@entity223 's 2012 appearance is less remembered for his straw poll victory than for his description of himself as " severely conservative " in his speech to the audience			0
last year 's contest ended up being a two - person race , with @entity49 winning the straw poll with 25 % of the vote , one percentage point ahead of @entity51			0
the 21 other people on the ballot were far behind , registering in single digits			0
this year , 26 names are on the straw poll ballot .			0

@entity8 is the country 's largest gathering of conservative leaders and activists
most of the potential @entity19 2016 candidates will speak to the conference
some conservatives are *staying* away from the conference , saying it 's too mainstream
