@entity2 just when you thought it was safe to go back on the @entity7 campaign trail , @entity0 and @entity1 are back			1
all it took to set @entity10 abuzz at the first big @entity7 campaign bash at the weekend was for @entity1 and the 2008 vice presidential nominee to clear their throats and muse , yet again , about presidential campaigns			1
but the idea that they 're both seriously searching their souls and considering a run for the @entity22 does n't pass the smell test			0
@entity1 and @entity0 are now more at the reality show end of the political spectrum than serious contenders -- but they sure know how to get a headline			1
they snatched more than their fair share of attention at congressman @entity34 's cattle call in @entity35 on saturday -- even as an impressive line - up of bona fide potential candidates tried to road test early 2016 messaging			1
there are serious candidates out there who are almost certainly running for president -- including @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , all of whom were at the @entity35 event			2
and there are those who just want some people to believe they might , just , might , run			0
given all the available evidence , @entity0 and @entity1 belong in the latter category			1
both are past masters at self publicity and appeared to view the massive media spotlight of the first big campaign event in @entity35 as a great opportunity at the start of another campaign cycle			2
@entity0 launched a bizarre , stream of consciousness rant against @entity66 the left , president @entity68 and the strange social media palaver whipped up by pictures of her son @entity0 standing on his labrador			1
her performance was all the more odd since she had deliberately raised expectations that she might be mulling a return to top - level politics ahead of the speech			0
she told @entity78 that anyone like her with a " servant 's heart " had no choice but to think about it			0
then , after bumping into reporters at a @entity85 hotel , @entity0 said " who would n't be interested ? " , according to the @entity86			1
so is @entity0 really considering a run for president ? see also : @entity92 's invisible man strategy her largely inconsequential speech offered easy ammunition for her political enemies , making for an ineffective start			1
and there 's no evidence that @entity0 is taking the serious moves needed of a candidate in an age when the price of entry for the presidential sweep stakes is millions of dollars			1
there 's also no buzz that @entity0 has sounded out top party donors or wants to snap up big name consultants			1
though some of her attack lines hit their mark with the audience of conservative activists , @entity0 was a pale imitation of the rock star who burst onto the scene in 2008 showing raw and rare political talent			1
and the notion of a @entity0 presidential campaign seems a lot more remote than when she teased a run , but ultimately decided against it , in the last presidential cycle			1
her performance on saturday dismayed key figures in conservative media , including some who thought she was unfairly put to the sword by the press in 2008			2
conservative columnist @entity131 wrote in his @entity133 column that the @entity7 has a @entity0 problem			1
" if there is indeed nothing behind her ' seriously interested ' talk — and it appears there is not — should she be included in events leading up to the 2016 caucuses ? " @entity131 wrote			2
conservative blogger @entity141 meanwhile said @entity0 's speech was best " left uncommented on			2
@entity145 communications director @entity144 put out a simple statement reading " thank you			0
" the pro-clinton super @entity149 for @entity150 fired out a fundraising email on the back of @entity0 's comments			2
see also : pro-clinton group raises money off @entity0 speech @entity1 meanwhile used the @entity158 to relaunch his own political sideshow , in mothballs since his 2012 presidential musings and his campaign to get @entity68 to publish his birth certificate			1
but he touched raw nerves in the @entity7 , launching a fierce attack on potential establishment frontrunners @entity92 and @entity167 who skipped the event			0
his broadsides seemed to fly in the face of efforts by party bosses to remove the circus atmosphere which marred the 2012 @entity7 presidential debates			0
' @entity167 had his chance , " he said			0
" he should have won and he choked			0
you do n't want to give a choker a second chance			0
" " we 've had enough of the @entity180 , " @entity1 blasted			2
there is a long tradition of long - shot candidates launching presidential runs without any expectation of victory			0
while many hope lightning will strike -- comparative unknowns like @entity188 and @entity68 built campaigns in @entity35 that ended at @entity22 -- most know it wo n't			0
but running for president in @entity35 , even if you do n't make it to the caucuses themselves can be a good career move			0
former gov. @entity199 for instance parlayed a campaign that never got off the ground into a job as secretary of the @entity204			0
other candidates -- like @entity145 gadfly @entity206 and libertarian @entity207 -- have used presidential campaigns to build personal political brands			2
@entity210 got less than 1 % of the votes in the @entity35 caucuses in 2008 -- but ended up as a two - term vice president			0
in each of those cases , the candidates offered more steak than sizzle ; more policy than pizzazz			0
and then there are those like @entity1 , who thrives on attention , and @entity0 , who needs to maintain a brand on the fringes of conservative media , for whom the oxygen of publicity as a new campaign grinds into gear seems too enticing to ignore .			1

@entity0 and @entity1 flirt with media with 2016 talk
no sign of serious campaigns
but candidates have an *incentive* to keep their names in the frame
