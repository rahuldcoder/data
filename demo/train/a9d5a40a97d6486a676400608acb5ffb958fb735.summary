on may 23 , president @entity0 gave a major speech at the @entity2 in @entity3 stating his intention to recalibrate his counterterrorism strategy , which is now largely defined by a covert @entity7 drone program that has come under increased public and congressional scrutiny over the past couple of years			1
the speech did little to illuminate details of the @entity7 drone program of the future , and the president was careful to emphasize that the @entity16 would continue to reserve the right to use force " against terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the @entity16 people			1
" but the overarching theme of @entity0 's remarks was one of increasing restraint in @entity16 national security policy			1
@entity0 also said : " before any strike is taken , there must be near - certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured -- the highest standard we can set			2
" so has anything changed in the past five months ? a study of drone strike activity since may 23 , tabulated by the @entity35 from news reports , provides some answers			2
the @entity0 administration has cut the number of @entity7 drone strikes considerably in @entity41 and has slightly slowed the number of strikes in @entity44			1
at the same time , the targets of the drone strikes have increasingly tended to be the leaders of @entity48 or affiliated groups rather than mere foot soldiers			2
nevertheless , the drone program continues to involve a number of civilian casualties and not enough has been done to make it as transparent and legally sustainable as the president has promised			1
there were just 10 drone strikes in @entity41 during the past five months ; an average of one strike every 15 days			1
in the year before @entity0 's speech , drone strikes happened every eight days			1
the average death toll of the most recent strikes in @entity41 is about six , which is about the same as the average death toll over the year before @entity0 's may speech , indicating that changes to the program have not included restricting the sizes of those groups of suspected militants that are being targeted			2
according to media reports , four top militant leaders were killed in strikes in @entity41 and @entity44 since the may speech , which is a much higher rate of " high - value " targeting than was seen previously			0
just seven militant leaders were reported killed in the 44 strikes that took place during the year before @entity0 's keynote speech on terrorism			2
the pace of drone strikes fell in @entity44 after @entity0 's speech , too , but not as sharply as it did in @entity41			1
since may 23 , there have been 12 strikes in @entity44 ; an average of about one strike every 13 days			0
over the previous year , a strike occurred about once every 10 days			0
as in @entity41 , the size of the groups targeted in @entity44 has remained about the same after @entity0 's speech			2
the average death toll resulting from those 12 strikes was 4.5 , while the average death toll over the year prior was about six			0
starting in 2009 , the civilian casualty rate from drone strikes has been on a markedly downward trajectory in @entity41			1
that trend has continued into 2013 , during which no civilians have been confirmed killed in @entity41 , according to the @entity35 study			0
similarly , the @entity98 , a @entity99 - based organization that tracks drone strikes , also found no civilian casualties in @entity41 so far this year			1
but a 10 - year - old boy was killed in a drone strike in the @entity44 province of @entity44 on june 9 , and two civilians were reported killed in @entity44 on august 8			0
reports on @entity7 drones released tuesday by @entity108 and @entity109 highlight some of the civilian casualties that have been caused by drone strikes in @entity41 and @entity44 over the past several years			1
the @entity108 report recounts a strike in october 2012 , in which a 68 - year - old woman , @entity115 , was killed by a drone as she picked vegetables with her grandchildren , a number of whom were injured in the attack			0
the report observed " @entity108 is seriously concerned that these and other strikes have resulted in unlawful killings that may constitute extrajudicial executions or war crimes			2
" but even these on - the - ground investigations can not bring to light the full extent or impact of the @entity16 drone campaign			1
only greater transparency on the part of the government can do that			0
as @entity16 @entity138 justice @entity137 observed a century ago , " @entity135 is the best disinfectant			2
" how to proceed then ? perhaps the most practical idea to make the drone program as accountable as possible is to set up a @entity16 government body that is independent of the @entity7 and the @entity142 and that would conduct an after - action review of drone strikes to ensure that the victims of the strikes were not civilians and did indeed pose some kind of threat to the @entity16			1
it is human nature that if you know someone is grading your homework , you are likely to be more careful about how you perform			0
the creation of such an independent body would also allow the payment of compensation to any civilian victims of @entity7 drone strikes , a system that already exists in the @entity16 military , which has a mechanism in place to compensate the civilian victims of its drone strikes in conventional war zones such as @entity169			1
such a move would ensure that the families of injured children -- such as those identified in the @entity108 report released on tuesday -- could afford medical care without having to sell their land or other property			0
and more broadly , it 's a fact that international law often lags behind advances in the conduct of warfare			0
it took , for instance , until 1925 to ban the use of chemical weapons , despite their widespread use a decade earlier			0
similarly , the law today has hardly kept up with what drones allow the @entity16 to do , such as assassinate individuals a world away by remote control			2
one could imagine some future @entity197 - like protocol that would govern the world 's use of drones			0
on the left , such a development might be unpopular , as it would seem to codify the use of drones and the rights of states to attack terrorist groups outside of their borders			0
on the right , this could also be controversial , as it might seem to constrain @entity16 power			0
however , the fact is that the @entity16 government needs to do some hard thinking about this issue as the monopoly that the @entity16 , @entity218 and @entity219 have had on armed drones has evaporated			0
early this year , the @entity221 disclosed that it had planned to assassinate a notorious drug lord hiding in a remote mountainous part of @entity224 with an armed drone but opted to capture him instead			0
just as the @entity16 government justifies its @entity7 drone strikes in @entity41 and @entity44 with the argument that it is at war with terrorists such as @entity48 and its affiliates , one could imagine that @entity221 might strike @entity232 separatists in exile in @entity169 with drones under the same rubric , or that @entity236 -- which claims to have armed drones -- might attack @entity238 nationalists along its border with @entity41			1
the @entity16 , which has long been the guarantor of international order , should make its drone program as transparent and accountable as feasible and also start doing the hard work of creating some kind of international consensus about the future use of armed drones .			1

president @entity0 spoke six months ago of changes to the @entity16 drone war programs
@entity253 says strikes have *decreased* , but there are still civilian casualties
he says a board should be created to review drone strikes afterward
@entity262 : @entity16 needs to fix its drone program and work with other nations on standards
