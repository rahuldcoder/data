@entity3 , @entity4 -- " doing it nature 's way has the potential to change the way we grow food , make materials , harness energy , heal ourselves , store information , and conduct business			1
" @entity14 when self - confessed " nature nerd " @entity14 coined the term " biomimicry " in a book she published a decade ago , little did she know it would make her into an household name , rubbing shoulders with @entity23 stars			1
@entity14 is a champion of the biomimicry movement and helps companies to improve designs by turning to @entity27			1
the natural sciences writer now gives talks on the subject to riveted crowds and is a consultant to some of world 's biggest companies			2
in her capacity as " biologist at the design table , " @entity14 helps companies like @entity40 and @entity41 to innovate and improve their designs by using what already exists in nature			1
she also appeared as a consultant in the apocalyptic environmental documentary " 11th hour , " produced by @entity47 last year			2
@entity14 coined the term " biomimicry " from the @entity50 " bios , " meaning " life , " and " mimesis , " meaning " imitate			1
" " it was a surprise to me when the phone started ringing after my book came out in 1997 , " she told @entity5			1
" it was companies and individual inventors , companies that were inventing everyday and they had problems to solve			2
they said , ' gee the book is fabulous , it 's about all this science that 's happening in early stage research			2
but we 're doing innovation in real time			2
can you come and be a biologist at the design table ? " so far , using nature 's design genius has led to the creation of bat - inspired ultrasonic canes for the blind , synthetic sheets that collect water from mist and fog as desert beetles do , and paint that self - cleans like a lotus leaf			1
scientists are also working on making solar cells like leaves and supertough ceramics that resemble the inner shells of abalone , which is twice as durable as the ceramics used in jet engines			2
before @entity14 wrote her book , there was n't even a word to describe the work of a few scattered scientists looking for inspiration through nature in different corners of the world			1
history is , of course , littered with examples of humans copying nature 's design			1
one of the most notable was invented by the @entity105 engineer @entity104			0
whilst out walking his dog one day @entity104 became annoyed by the burrs catching and sticking to his clothes and in his dog 's fur			0
he decided to study them under a microscope			0
the magnification revealed a network of tiny hooks			0
the product of his labors was @entity120 , which was patented in 1951			0
at the core of @entity14 's beliefs is that nature has already spent 3.8 billion years on research and development			1
its failures are now fossils			0
she believes its successes contain strategies the human race can copy in its quest for a sustainable future			0
@entity14 has cultivated a deep knowledge of the natural world , beginning with direct observation in the @entity139 of @entity140 , continuing in habitats from @entity142 to @entity143 where she worked as a backcountry guide , and now , in her home wilds of @entity146			1
she graduated summa cum laude from @entity148 , @entity140 , with two degrees in @entity150 and @entity151			0
named by @entity152 as an environmental hero of 2007 , she 's now writing the sequel book , " nature 's @entity155 , " and also consults through her firm @entity157 , which came about following the massive demand for her knowledge			1
" from interiors , manufacturing everything from apparel to transportation to bath and kitchen and carpets and furniture and sneakers , and even cities , " she told @entity5			0
" i 'd be talking to groups of mayors and talking to the @entity173 parliament , policy makers and they all wanted to know how can we learn from nature how to design a more sustainable world			1
" " they want to know if there are blue prints , and of course there are			0
and they said ' great , bring over your biologists			0
" one of the companies that @entity14 has worked with is @entity187 , the world 's largest commercial carpet manufacturer			1
the process is particularly hard on the environment as it uses petrochemicals in every step and consumes vast amounts of energy , and produces tons of waste			0
but after working with @entity198 , @entity187 introduced @entity199 , a carpet inspired by random pattern formation in nature			2
it was a greener product that gave customers more flexibility as they could replace individual tiles instead of the whole carpet			0
entropy quickly rose to become @entity187 's top - selling line of carpet and still represents 40 percent of their carpet tile sales			0
with results like that , it seems , you ca n't argue with @entity27 .			0

@entity14 coined the term " biomimicry " in her *influential* 1997 book
biomimicry is the *concept* of looking for inspiration for design through nature
she was named by @entity152 as an environmental hero of 2007
