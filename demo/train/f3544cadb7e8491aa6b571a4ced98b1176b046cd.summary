-- thousands of protesters in cities across the @entity3 waved @entity3 flags as they rallied saturday against @entity6 's tough new immigration law and pushed for national immigration reform			1
" @entity13 , " " yes we can " and " @entity6 " were common refrains for groups protesting from @entity10 , @entity11 , to @entity12			1
may 1 is traditionally a rallying day for supporters of immigration reform			0
but protesters across the country said they were galvanized by @entity6 's recent passage of a law cracking down on illegal immigration			1
the new @entity6 law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they are in the @entity3 illegally			1
critics say it will lead to discrimination and racial profiling			0
but @entity6 gov. @entity33 has said the law is necessary because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with @entity37 , allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to move into the state			1
she said changes to the law she approved friday , which clarify that police could only stop suspected illegal immigrants while enforcing some other law or ordinance , should eliminate concerns about racial profiling			0
but criticism of the law was clear among tens of thousands of protesters flooding the streets of @entity10 on saturday , where organizers said they hoped to send a strong message with the number of people turning out			2
" does my face look illegal ? " one sign read			0
@entity58 , a spokeswoman for the @entity59 , said 50,000 people marched at the demonstration 's peak			2
@entity63 said the rally was " very peaceful " and no one was arrested			2
police arrested about 20 protesters -- including a @entity3 congressman -- at saturday 's rally in @entity70			1
rep. @entity71 , @entity72 , was among a group of protesters who were arrested for blocking the sidewalk outside the @entity77 in what they said was a planned act of civil disobedience			1
the protesters wore t - shirts that read " @entity84 " and " @entity85			0
" a smaller group of about 200 people rallied outside the @entity88 in @entity89 , protesting the new law and asking the federal government to step in to stop it			2
about 1,000 people gathered in @entity12 's @entity93 on saturday afternoon			1
@entity94 , an international studies student at @entity95 , told @entity0 he was an undocumented immigrant from @entity96			0
" i 've been living in this country six years and i 'm still fighting for immigration reform , " he said			0
@entity0 ireporter @entity99 said he saw signs in @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 at the @entity12 rally			1
one sign in the crowd particularly caught his eye : " @entity109 " -- " we are all @entity6			2
" " they were trying to convey that message that it 's a city and nation based on immigration			0
everybody came from somewhere else , " he said			0
