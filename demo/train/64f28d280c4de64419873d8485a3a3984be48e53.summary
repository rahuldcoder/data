-- @entity16 's " @entity15 " has more nominations , and among the nine contenders for best picture , only " @entity14 " has made less money at the box office , but ever since the @entity6 named a black and white @entity8 silent film the best picture of the year back in november , " @entity13 " has been the unlikely frontrunner in the @entity12 race			1
and there it has remained , picking up the lion 's share of the top prizes across the awards season , from the various trade guilds and industry groups to the @entity24 and the @entity25			2
there has been a similar conformity even in those categories -- like best actress -- which " @entity13 " wo n't win			2
" @entity31 " star @entity30 is the red - hot favorite in that race , which would extend @entity35 's losing streak to an unlucky 13 nominations since her 1983 win for " @entity38			1
" all of which could make sunday 's ceremony the most predictable -- and anti-climactic -- @entity12 in recent memory			1
and that 's saying something ! here 's the breakdown of the major categories , who we think will win , who should win , and our selections for the most undeserved omissions from the list , the nominees that @entity12 overlooked this year			1
the nominees sw = @entity54 @entity55 = will win @entity56 " @entity13 " @entity55 " @entity57 " " @entity58 " " @entity31 " " @entity15 " sw " midnight in @entity59 " " moneyball " " @entity14 " " @entity60 " overlooked : the industry did n't know what to make of " @entity65 , " @entity62 's film was overshadowed by its long and troubled backstory -- so it chose to ignore it			1
but this ragged , emotionally gripping drama was an unsung @entity70 masterpiece , a more probing study of grief and youth than " @entity74 , " " @entity57 " or even " @entity14 "			0
actress in a @entity76 @entity77 ( " @entity78 " ) @entity30 ( " @entity31 " ) @entity55 @entity79 ( " @entity80 " ) sw @entity81 ( " @entity82 " ) @entity83 ( " @entity84 " ) overlooked : @entity85 won the @entity12 for playing serial killer @entity86 in " monster , " but her performance in " @entity89 " is even more courageous and more nuanced			1
she dared to play a deeply damaged and highly dislikeable individual , and despite everything made us care			0
and spare a thought for @entity94 , whose chances were probably scuppered by her " @entity98 " director @entity97 's foolish remarks in @entity99			2
actor in a @entity76 @entity101 ( " @entity102 " ) sw @entity103 ( " @entity57 " ) @entity104 ( " @entity13 " ) @entity55 @entity105 ( " @entity106 " ) @entity107 ( " @entity108 " ) overlooked : @entity107 and @entity103 both gave career - best performances this year , but so did @entity110 , whose bigoted , self - loathing , alcoholic cop in " @entity113 " did n't get the promotion he deserved			1
@entity115 share their views on the @entity12 actress in a @entity118 @entity119 ( " @entity13 " ) @entity120 ( " @entity31 " ) @entity121 ( " bridesmaids " ) sw @entity123 ( " @entity78 " ) @entity124 ( " @entity31 " ) @entity55 overlooked : not overlooked entirely , but @entity120 could easily have been nominated twice , or even three times , in this category , such was the quality of her work as the innocent wife of the deranged @entity130 in " @entity131 " and her angelic mother in @entity133 's " @entity14			1
" actor in a @entity118 @entity135 ( " @entity84 " ) @entity136 ( " moneyball " ) @entity137 ( " warrior " ) @entity139 ( " beginners " ) @entity55 , @entity140 @entity142 ( " @entity58 " ) overlooked : @entity143 ( " @entity89 " ) and @entity144 ( " drive " ) had every right to expect nominations this year , and frankly their @entity148 colleagues got it wrong			0
directing @entity150 ( " @entity151 " ) @entity152 ( " @entity13 " ) @entity55 @entity133 ( " @entity14 " ) @entity153 ( " @entity57 " ) @entity16 ( " @entity15 " ) sw overlooked : like comedy , sci - fi movies get a raw deal at awards time			2
@entity158 made one of the smartest , most entertaining movies of the year with " @entity161			0
" too bad nobody noticed			0
animated feature " @entity164 " " @entity165 " sw " @entity166 " " @entity167 " " @entity168 " @entity55 overlooked : it was n't a great year for animation , but " @entity176 " was a typically witty and ingenious effort from @entity172 , the studio that gave us @entity174 and " @entity175			0
" @entity177 " @entity178 " " footnote " " in darkness " " @entity181 " @entity55 " a separation " sw overlooked : where to begin ? well , " @entity187 " for a start , the @entity186 police procedural that 's part road film , part existential comedy , all masterpiece			0
documentary feature " @entity192 " " @entity193 " " @entity194 3 " " @entity195 " @entity55 , sw " undefeated " overlooked : again , multiple omissions here , including " @entity198 , " " @entity199 " and " @entity200 , " any of which would have made a worthy winner .			0

" @entity13 " has been the unlikely frontrunner in the @entity12 race
" @entity31 " star @entity30 is the red - hot favorite in that race
all of which could make sunday 's ceremony the most predictable and anti-climactic
