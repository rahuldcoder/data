billions of locusts -- everywhere the eye can see , eating most everything in sight			1
that 's the harsh reality affecting roughly half the island nation of @entity6 , infested by swarms of the bugs flying in sometimes mile - long packs			1
run for 30 to 45 minutes , and you still might not be able to shake them			0
" it 's like you are in a movie , it 's incredible , " said @entity12 of the @entity14 @entity13 , or @entity13 , from the country 's capital of @entity17			1
" you do n't see anything except locusts			2
you turn around , there are locusts everywhere			2
" locusts ' targets are n't people , but they do ravenously devour what people eat -- directly in the form of crops , and indirectly in the form of pastureland that livestock and other animals graze on			1
without concerted and effective action , experts say the crisis could very easily prove deadly in a nation such as @entity6 , where the @entity14 estimates more than two - thirds of residents lived in poverty before this crisis			1
doing nothing would mean the locust plague could spread across two - thirds of the island , which sits in the @entity48 off @entity50 's southeastern coast			1
even after a lull in winter , they 'd wake up in the spring in greater numbers and , without action , remain a devastating presence for a full decade , @entity12 said			2
this year 's infestation is the worst since the 1950s			2
older farmers who remember that crisis and see the big swarms nowadays " stop farming , because they know that it 's useless , " said @entity12 , the @entity13 's emergency and rehabilitation coordinator in @entity6			1
" they know there 's hunger coming on			0
" photos : locusts plague the @entity68 by virtue of its distinct location , @entity6 is one of the world 's most ecologically diverse areas			1
about 90 % of its plant species exist nowhere else on the planet , according to the @entity77 , and many of its bird , reptile and animal species -- including all the world 's lemurs in the wild -- are endemic			0
the quality of life , however , for @entity6 's more than 22 million people is low compared to many other countries			1
some 77 % of its residents live on less than $ 1.25 per day , according to @entity93 official @entity92			0
it 's infant mortality rate of 47.40 deaths per 1,000 live births ranks 47th highest out of 223 ranked by the @entity98			0
the situation has been compounded by natural disasters like @entity101 that killed at least 23 people and adversely affected some 22,000 others , as well as a prolonged political crisis after an effective military coup in 2009			0
that was followed by criticism of @entity6 's new leaders -- such as from @entity111 @entity110 , who noted reports that press freedoms had been restricted , political enemies were being held for years without trial , and civilians were raped or executed while their villages burned			1
the criticism contributed to a sharp drop in foreign aid , which accounted for 70 % of the government budget			0
using the @entity121 to study locust swarms but the international community remains involved in @entity6 -- including the @entity111 , which donates $ 70 million annually			1
even more help is urgently needed , @entity13 officials said , in order to prevent an even worse humanitarian crisis tied to the locust plague			0
long - term , the @entity14 organization is seeking $ 19 million for an early warning system -- so the next time locusts appear , authorities can act quickly and decisively to prevent their spread			2
but it 's too late for that this time , @entity12 said			0
that 's why the agency is seeking $ 22 million through june to carry out a large - scale spraying operation			0
these figures do not include whatever food and humanitarian assistance @entity6 could need			2
" there is no more use in preventing anything , " said @entity12 , stressing the pressing need to fight the infestation			0
" it is really an emergency situation			0

billions of locusts infest half of @entity6 and could cover *2/3* of the island nation
without action , the flying bugs could plague the country for 10 years , a @entity14 official says
" you turn around , there are locusts everywhere , " he says , noting swarms stretch for miles
locusts devour crops and pastureland , which could devastate @entity6 's poor
