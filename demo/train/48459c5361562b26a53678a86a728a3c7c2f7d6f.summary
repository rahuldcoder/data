-- big banks have found few political friends in recent years			0
excoriated by president @entity4 and progressive democrats like @entity6 for their " greedy " policies , rejected by @entity9 conservatives for being too cozy with @entity10 , and even seemingly scolded by @entity11 in his @entity12 last month , it 's almost as if @entity13 has been sent to the woodshed			1
and after the 2012 presidential election , it 's not hard to understand why no one wants to appear too comfortable with the " plutocracy			0
" many have argued that @entity22 's @entity21 pedigree and his comments at the @entity24 , @entity25 , home of private equity manager @entity26 about the " 47 % " helped tank his campaign			2
fate sealed : @entity22 - the - plutocrat was cooked			0
but perhaps the big banks have found an unlikely new ally : @entity32			0
an article in @entity34 this week , one that elicited little response from @entity37 , recounted @entity39 's recent remarks to @entity41 executives and a few hundred major investors , seemingly to reassure them that she did n't think the banks were all bad			1
according to the story ( ironically headlined , " lament of the @entity45 " ) : " ... @entity39 offered a message that the collected plutocrats found reassuring , according to accounts offered by several attendees , declaring that the banker - bashing so popular within both political parties was unproductive and indeed foolish			1
striking a soothing note on the global financial crisis , she told the audience , in effect : we all got into this mess together , and we 're all going to have to work together to get out of it			0
what the bankers heard her to say was just what they would hope for from a prospective presidential candidate : beating up the finance industry is n't going to improve the economy -- it needs to stop			0
and indeed @entity41 's @entity66 , who heads the bank 's asset management business , introduced @entity39 by saying how courageous she was for speaking at the bank			1
( @entity71 , perhaps , but also well - compensated : @entity39 's minimum fee for paid remarks is $ 200,000 )			2
" it 's hard to imagine how this will square with @entity4 's renewed progressive , middle - class agenda for @entity37			1
according to the @entity79 , raising the minimum wage and lessening income inequality will be major parts of @entity4 's 2014 domestic plan -- as well as his @entity83 address and budget			2
more problematic is how @entity32 's bighearted rhetoric toward @entity13 will accord with @entity37 generally			2
you do n't have to go to @entity6 in @entity87 or @entity88 in @entity89 ; it is n't hard to find a @entity91 , be they union machinist , single mom , or @entity96 cashier , who wants to punish the banks and weaken their influence in politics and everything else we do			0
hardest of all to figure is how this will square with @entity39 herself			0
since leaving the @entity106 , she 's made concerted ( and some would argue necessary ) efforts at rebranding herself as more progressive , speaking on voting rights , women 's issues , and gay rights			0
in a recent @entity113 piece by @entity114 titled " @entity115 ? a @entity37 that realizes its soul lies with @entity6 , " the writer describes @entity39 's hard left turn this way : " she recently used the word ' progressive ' so many times in a single speech it was tempting to describe her condition as ' severe			1
' " indeed , is @entity39 in danger of becoming the next @entity22 ? heir ( ess ) to the throne , the natural front - runner , but out of touch with " the little people , " stuck in the rhetoric -- and @entity134 politicking -- of the 1990s ? i talked to several @entity37 strategists who were incredulous that @entity39 cozied up to the bankers , and wondered how long it would take for progressive groups -- or @entity140 -- to jump on it			1
her bizarre tryst with @entity41 and friends , and her nurturing message to them , does n't only put her to the right of progressive superstars like @entity149 and @entity88 -- and to the right of @entity4 , and to the right of most @entity37 voters -- but also to the right of many anti-bank , populist conservatives			1
that 's tough -- and odd -- territory for @entity32 to stake out in the run - up to a presidential election			0
but will @entity37 hold her accountable ? or will she get a pass because she 's ( sigh ) @entity32 ? @entity6 , where are you ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			1

@entity165 : @entity32 met with @entity41 execs , investors , brought reassuring message
she says that 's at odds with progressive stance of @entity149 , @entity4 . how will it play to left ?
she says @entity39 courting progressives too ; may have trouble *reconciling* two camps
@entity182 : @entity39 could end up like @entity22 : out of touch *wih* ' little people , ' mouthing 90s rhetoric
