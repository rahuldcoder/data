-- an @entity2 - era portico in @entity4 's @entity3 has become the latest battleground in a conflict between those who want to preserve the city 's architectural heritage and @entity11 authorities pushing for redevelopment			1
the 17th century portico -- one of the oldest parts of the @entity3 , @entity17 's holiest -- is being removed by @entity4 authorities as part of an expansion project to create more space for soaring numbers of pilgrims			1
millions of people visit @entity4 and @entity25 annually ( two million of them during the @entity27 pilgrimage alone ) , a number that is only expected to grow rapidly in the coming years			1
however , one @entity30 - based @entity11 historian says what @entity11 authorities are doing in @entity4 amounts to " cultural vandalism			1
" @entity34 , executive director of the @entity35 , which seeks to preserve historical sites in @entity11 , says significant features of @entity4 and @entity25 's architectural history are being lost on account of the renovations			1
he has called on the @entity17 world to voice its disapproval at the demolitions , which he likened to the torching of ancient manuscripts by islamists in @entity48 , @entity49			0
every follower must carry out the @entity27 once in their lives , if physically and financially able to do so			0
overcrowding at the @entity27 has resulted in fatal stampedes on a number of occasions , with 1,426 pilgrims killed in 1990 and more than 350 killed in 2006			2
@entity58 's @entity57 , the supervisor of the project at @entity4 's @entity3 , told @entity0 the expansion would triple the amount of space there			1
" ( the authorities ) want to offer more space to the pilgrims to avoid crowds , " he said			0
but @entity34 says there 's a better way			0
" i 'm not against expanding the mosques at all , but there are ways you can go about it without destroying the historical aspects of these sites , " he said			0
" rather than engaging with heritage concerns , the @entity11 are simply not interested			0
" clashes with @entity79 @entity79 says it is alarmed by the loss of the @entity2 portico and its @entity82 has been in correspondence with the @entity11 over the matter since 2010			1
more from inside the @entity85 : can @entity87 's geeks save the country ? " it is very important to preserve the @entity93 porches as the legacy of the @entity2 where they stand , " @entity79 's @entity89 said in a statement to @entity0			2
@entity0 contacted the @entity101 , local officials in @entity11 , including the mayor and @entity98 of @entity4 and the @entity99 in @entity100			1
but we were unsuccessful in getting a response to our request for comment			0
@entity34 said the authorities were inclined not to value aspects of @entity4 's heritage that dated from before @entity11 control over the city -- such as the portico , going back centuries to @entity2 sovereignty over the city -- because that evidence of a @entity4 undermined the kingdom 's important position in the @entity35 world as guardians of the city			1
this is not the first time @entity11 authorities have clashed with @entity79 over the destruction of @entity2 - era buildings in @entity4 , which @entity79 views as in important part of a shared @entity35 heritage			1
in 2002 , @entity128 made a heated protest about the destruction of @entity4 's @entity132 fortress , built on a hill overlooking the @entity93 in the late 18th century			1
both the citadel and the hill it sat on were demolished to make way for the skyscraper city that today looms over the @entity3 , prompting @entity79 's then minister of culture , @entity139 , to accuse the @entity11 of an " act of barbarism			1
" @entity4 's changing face over the past 10 years , @entity4 's skyline has transformed			1
lavish skyscrapers now tower over devotees circling the @entity93 in the @entity3			0
most imposing is the @entity146 , a 120 - floor hotel that resembles @entity100 's @entity147 and which , at 601 meters , is the world 's second tallest building			0
the @entity150 - based @entity149 estimates that 95 % of @entity4 's millennium - old buildings have been demolished in the past two decades			1
@entity11 authorities say the changes are part of a push to modernize offerings to pilgrims , who have traditionally stayed in austere lodgings			1
the @entity11 government is also pushing forward with major redevelopments at @entity25 's @entity160 -- where the @entity161 is believed to be buried			2
more from inside the @entity85 : @entity163 women change motor racing up a gear @entity34 claims the threat to the heritage of the mosques adds to a wider pattern of destruction of historic sites in @entity11			2
he says it reflects an ideological agenda stemming from the kingdom 's ultraconservative @entity175 brand of @entity17			0
he added that the @entity175 place great emphasis on avoiding the sin of " shirq " -- idolatry , or polytheism -- which they believe is encouraged by shrines , tombs or anything that could promote alternative forms of worship , or the veneration of an entity other than @entity190			0
the @entity192 says it plans to close or eradicate 14 historic sites around @entity4 , so that pilgrims from other countries can not engage in idolatrous rituals there , the @entity191 reported last month			2
as a consequence of their @entity175 beliefs , said @entity34 , the @entity11 had systematically destroyed such sites since the early days of the kingdom			2
demolitions over the decades in 1925 , the year the first @entity11 king , @entity202 , captured @entity25 , the @entity11 demolished the mausoleums in al - baqi cemetery attached to the @entity160			2
more from inside the @entity85 : who will win battle for the new @entity207 ? the raids at @entity209 -- which is believed to house the remains of number of the prophet 's wives , children and other relatives -- and at the @entity217 cemetery in @entity4 , caused an outcry from the international @entity17 community			2
some still mourn the destruction as a " day of sorrow			0
" separately , the site of the house said to belong to the prophet 's first wife , @entity224 , which @entity34 was involved in excavating in the 1980s , today contains a toilet block for pilgrims , while the site believed to be the prophet 's birthplace was a cattle market before being turned into a library			0
some @entity235 groups abroad , such as @entity237 's @entity236 , support the renovations around the @entity3			0
" we do not sanctify places or people , but we go according to what the @entity243 said and what the @entity161 said , " the group 's secretary general , sheikh @entity239 , told @entity0			0
" there is no place that is holier than the @entity93 , so if the @entity11 government decided to expand then this is because they care about @entity17 more than the heritage			0

@entity11 authorities have begun *dismantling* a historic @entity2 area of @entity4 's @entity3
a @entity30 - based @entity11 historian says the demolition is " cultural vandalism "
@entity11 govt says it is expanding mosque to *accommodate* soaring numbers of @entity27 pilgrims
historian *disagrees* , says demolition is *fuelled* by @entity11 *religious* beliefs
