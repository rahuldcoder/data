@entity0 -- @entity3 's revered founder , @entity2 , ordered his doctors to find a way to make him live to 100 , taking treatments to stay young that ranged from the bizarre to the sinister			1
@entity9 , his personal physician for many years before she defected to @entity10 in 1992 , led research at a " @entity12 " set up to help in @entity2 's quest for a longer life			1
it did n't work -- he died at 82 -- but that 's still far better than the average 64 - year life expectancy for the country			0
people who made it to 100 and beyond the doctor 's team devised many different ways to ensure a longer life			2
" we did a lot of research , " says @entity2			2
" but we only gave him the treatments he had chosen from our list of options			0
" one treatment the late leader favored in his later years , according to @entity2 , was blood transfusions from citizens in their twenties			1
those who had been chosen for the honor of donating blood to the " eternal president " were fed special nutritious food beforehand			0
" he wanted to rule as long as he could			0
i think he wanted to live a long life for his own satisfaction , " says @entity2			1
another favorite , according to @entity2 , was watching young children do funny or cute things to make him laugh			2
the center decided happiness brings good health , so prescribed more laughter to the @entity3 leader			1
@entity2 is seen smiling in many official photos			2
comparison with younger @entity2 after witnessing the stresses and health issues experienced by @entity2 , the doctor says @entity58 , the country 's current leader and @entity2 's grandson , could be suffering from similar problems			1
the elder @entity2 has often often been compared to his grandson , who shares his looks and demeanor			0
walking with a cane , the young leader appeared in public last week for the first time in more than a month amid speculation about his health			0
before his disappearance , @entity2 was seen limping , prompting theories that he was suffering everything from weight gain to gout			0
according to the doctor , the young leader may have inherited a number of health issues , including psychological problems and a history of obesity			0
she told @entity1 both @entity2 and @entity2 's father @entity82 suffered from diabetes , heart problems and stress , and she reckons that the younger @entity2 's health problems could be worse than his father 's and grandfather 's			1
after studying photos , she said @entity2 's face appeared to have been swollen due to painkillers and she also speculated that he has been receiving hormone shots to make him look more like his grandfather			1
@entity1 can not independently verify this claim			0
" @entity2 still has a good reputation because he was the founder of the country			0
so in order to instill in people that it is still @entity2 's country , i think they are trying to make @entity58 look like more like him			1

former @entity3 leader @entity2 wanted to live to 100 , his doctor says .
he ordered a " @entity12 " be set up to fulfill this aim
*methods* included blood transfusions and laughing at cute kids
