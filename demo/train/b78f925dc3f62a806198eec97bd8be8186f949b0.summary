@entity0 , @entity1 -- a mechanical problem prevented @entity4 from inserting a tube into a ruptured pipe that would help siphon off oil leaking into the @entity9 , @entity4 official @entity3 said saturday			1
@entity3 said the device was hoisted back to the surface friday for readjustments and the company expects to have it working by saturday night			1
the plan is for the mile - long tube to collect the oil and send it to a surface vessel			2
millions of gallons of crude have gushed into the @entity9 since the fiery explosion and sinking of the @entity23 drilling rig more than three weeks ago			0
@entity3 , @entity4 's chief operating officer for exploration and production , cautioned that the method is designed to contain the flow , not stop it			1
the tactic was dealt a setback friday night when the frame holding the insertion tube shifted and prevented the surface vessel from connecting to it , @entity3 said			1
meanwhile , @entity3 said the application of underwater dispersants -- a tactic approved for use friday -- " appears " to be working			1
" the oil in the immediate vicinity of the well and the ships and rigs working in the area is diminished from previous observations , " he said after flying over the area saturday			1
he did not provide further details			0
what are oil dispersants ? the @entity49 and the @entity50 said friday that the decision to use subsea dispersants is an " important step " at reducing potential damage from the spill , because dispersant can be more effective underwater than on the ocean 's surface			1
oil dispersants are chemicals that can break the oil down into small drops and prevent it from reaching the surface or the shore			0
dispersants are generally less harmful than the oil itself , which is highly toxic , and they biodegrade more quickly , the @entity49 said			0
the underwater gusher began after an april 20 explosion aboard the @entity23			0
the explosion and subsequent fire caused the @entity23 to sink two days later , prompting oil to begin spilling from the well			0
@entity4 was leasing the rig from @entity75			1
on saturday , the @entity76 released a letter from homeland security secretary @entity78 and interior secretary @entity79 addressed to @entity81 executive @entity80 , calling on the company to state its " true intentions " for compensating those affected by the spill			0
" the @entity84 may prove to be one of the most devastating environmental disasters this nation has ever faced , " said the letter , which was dated friday			0
" as one of the responsible parties for this event , @entity4 is accountable to the @entity93 public for the full clean - up of this spill and all the economic loss caused by the spill and related events			2
" what can @entity4 do to combat growing oil spill ? the letter also asks @entity4 to confirm it will not " seek reimbursement from the @entity93 taxpayers , the @entity93 government or the @entity104 for any amount			2
" there was no immediate response from @entity4 .			2
