@entity0 -- the @entity2 granted a temporary stay of execution late wednesday for a condemned @entity6 inmate who is requesting dna testing of evidence in his case			1
the order was handed down less than an hour before @entity11 , 47 , was scheduled to be executed by injection for the @entity14 1993 killings of his live - in girlfriend and her two sons			1
the @entity2 granted the temporary stay while it considers whether to take up @entity11 's broader appeal			1
it was not immediately clear when the court might consider the case , but there was no indication a decision would be made before thursday			0
@entity11 's attorneys maintain that dna testing of the evidence could establish his innocence and determine the real killer			1
" this action suggests that the court believes there are important issues that require closer examination , " defense attorney @entity28 said of the temporary stay			2
" we remain hopeful that the court will agree to hear mr. @entity11 's case and ultimately allow him the chance to prove his innocence through dna testing			1
" @entity11 heard the news while he was eating what was to be his last meal , according to @entity42 , a spokeswoman for the @entity43			2
he expressed relief and surprise , saying , " i had made up my mind i was going to die " and " i feel like i really won today , " according to @entity42			0
@entity11 said he is " eager to get the dna testing so i can prove my innocence and get the hell out of here , " according to @entity42			1
@entity6 gov. @entity51 has received more than 8,000 letters from @entity11 's advocates urging a stay , according to the @entity55 and @entity56 , whose members and supporters have sent the letters through their web sites			1
state sen. @entity61 and state rep. @entity62 were among those who have called for a reprieve			0
" it has come to my attention that there are numerous problems with mr. @entity11 's case that raise serious questions regarding the fairness of his trial and whether or not he is guilty , " @entity61 wrote in a letter to @entity51 on tuesday			1
word about the case has spread as far as @entity78 , where demonstrations were planned wednesday at the @entity80 in @entity81 by supporters of @entity11 's @entity78 wife , @entity83			1
since @entity11 's conviction in 1995 , he " has tirelessly pursued access to the untested physical evidence , " according to court documents filed with the @entity2 in february			1
that evidence includes vaginal swabs and fingernail clippings from @entity11 's then - girlfriend @entity91 , hairs found in her hand and two knives found at the scene , along with a dish towel and a windbreaker jacket , according to the filing			1
@entity11 has never denied being in the home when @entity91 and her sons -- @entity101 , 22 , and @entity102 , 20 , -- were killed			1
however , he maintains he was incapacitated because of the " extreme quantities of alcohol and codeine " that he had consumed earlier that evening , according to the documents			0
prosecutors maintain forensic evidence gathered at the scene and witness statements point to @entity11			2
a female friend of @entity11 's who lived four blocks away testified at @entity11 's trial that he walked to her trailer and told her that he may have kicked @entity91 to death , although evidence did not show she had been kicked			1
the neighbor has since recanted parts of her testimony			0
authorities followed a blood trail from the crime scene to the female friend 's trailer and found @entity11 in the closet , authorities said			2
he was " wearing heavily blood - stained jeans and socks and bearing a gash on the palm of his right hand , " according to the @entity6 attorney general 's summary of the case			2
in addition , authorities said cuts on @entity11 's hand came from the knife used to stab the men			1
@entity11 said he cut it on glass			2
some dna testing was done , which implicated @entity11 , but not on the items he now wants tested			1
" dna testing showed that blood on the shirt @entity11 was wearing at the time of his arrest was @entity91 's blood , and blood on @entity11 's jeans was a mixture of blood from @entity101 and @entity157 , " authorities said			1
however , @entity28 wrote in the @entity2 filing , " the victims ' injuries show that whoever murdered them must have possessed considerable strength , balance and coordination			2
" @entity91 was strangled so forcefully that her larynx and the hyoid bone in her throat were broken			0
she then was struck with an axe or pick handle 14 times , hard enough to drive fragments of her " unusually thick skull " into her brain , the court documents said			0
" while attacking ms. @entity91 , the perpetrator had to contend with the presence of her 6 - foot - 6 - inch , 225 - pound son , @entity101 , who blood spatter analysis showed was in the immediate vicinity of his mother as she was being beaten , " the court filing said			0
" somehow , the murderer was able to change weapons and stab @entity184 several times before he could fend off the attack or flee			0
" @entity102 was then stabbed to death in the bedroom the two brothers shared , the documents said			0
evidence presented at trial suggested that @entity91 's uncle , @entity193 -- who is now dead -- could have been the killer			0
at a @entity14 she attended for a short time on the last night of her life , @entity193 stalked her , making crude sexual remarks , according to trial testimony			0
a friend who drove her home from the party testified she was " fidgety and worried " and that @entity193 was no longer at the party when he returned			0
" the defense presented evidence that @entity193 was a hot - tempered ex-con who had sexually molested a girl , grabbed a pregnant woman by the throat and kept a knife in his car , " according to @entity28 's letter to @entity51			0
an expert testified at trial that @entity11 would have been too intoxicated to commit the crimes , and a review of the evidence suggests that @entity11 might have been even more intoxicated than initially thought , @entity28 writes			2
media outlets in @entity6 have been supportive of a reprieve for @entity11			1
" before sending a man to die , we need to be absolutely sure of his guilt , " the @entity215 wrote in an editorial friday			0
@entity11 's wife , @entity83 , told @entity220 in a tuesday interview that she began writing to @entity11 in 1996 and they began visiting in 2000			1
" i 'm convinced of his innocence not because i love him and he 's my husband , i 'm convinced of his innocence ... [ because ] there is scientific forensic evidence to prove that he was not even in a state to stand up at the time of the crime let alone murder three people that he loved , " @entity222 told @entity1 's " @entity236 " on wednesday night after the stay had been granted			1
" there is absolutely no motive			0
" @entity222 also said she finds it " mind - boggling that evidence preserved from the crime scene 15 years later -- including the murder weapon , a rape kit , nail clippings from one of the victims , a male jacket that does n't fit his size at all with sweat , hair , dna -- to this day is not tested			0
" recently , questions have swirled in @entity6 regarding the 2004 execution of @entity255 for a fire that killed his three daughters			2
on march 19 , @entity51 issued a posthumous pardon to the family of @entity260 , who was serving a 25 - year sentence for aggravated sexual assault when he died in prison from an asthma attack			0
after his death , dna tests established his innocence , and another man confessed to the crime			0
@entity1 's @entity269 , @entity270 and @entity271 contributed to this report .			0
