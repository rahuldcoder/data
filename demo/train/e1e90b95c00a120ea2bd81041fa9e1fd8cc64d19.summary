secretary of state @entity0 said thursday the @entity1 would be willing to negotiate with the leader of @entity4 's @entity3 if he met conditions that have been laid out			1
testifying at a hearing of the @entity8 , @entity6 did not dismiss the prospect when asked by rep. @entity10 , @entity11 , whether reconciliation talks with the @entity3 and other insurgents would include talking with @entity3 leader @entity14			1
" you do n't make peace with your friends , " she said , speaking days after concluding a weeklong trip that included stops in both @entity4 and @entity18			2
there first would have to be a demonstrated willingness on the @entity3 's part to negotiate and to meet the conditions already laid out for joining negotiations , she said			1
" we have been clear , " she had told the committee earlier , " about the necessary outcomes of any negotiation : insurgents must renounce violence , abandon @entity34 , and abide by the constitution of @entity4 , including its protections for women and minorities			1
if insurgents can not meet those red - lines , they will face continued and unrelenting assault			1
" but she said it is important for an inclusive @entity4 - led peace and reconciliation process , in which the parties talk to former insurgents who are ready to renounce violence			0
pressed during questioning about what makes her certain that insurgents will change course and renounce an extremist ideology , @entity6 said she is " very realistic , " and recognizes not all of them will			2
some 2,500 fighters have already begun the process of reintegrating and have expressed weariness with the @entity3 , she said			2
in that vein , she said , there have been recent threads of intelligence showing a debate in these societies on issues such as letting girls go to school that she finds promising			0
talks have not yet reached the stage where it is known how many insurgents harbor a desire to reintegrate , she said			0
@entity6 last week disclosed a meeting this past summer between the @entity1 and a representative of the @entity18 - based @entity77 at the request of @entity18 's intelligence service			1
she said such meetings are part of a strategy in which " we want to fight , talk and build all at the same time			0
" " part of the reason for that is to test whether these organizations have any willingness to negotiate in good faith , " she said			0
" there 's evidence going both ways , to be clear			0
sometimes we hear that they will , that there are elements within each that wish to pursue that			0
and then other times that it 's off the table			0
so i think that with respect to the @entity105 , it illustrates this point			0
" in her opening remarks , @entity6 said that while " serious challenges " remain , work in both @entity4 and @entity18 has " yielded significant results , " noting that the success of the @entity1 presence in the region sometimes gets lost in the public debate			1
" @entity117 and many of his top lieutenants are dead , " she said			0
while " the threat remains real and urgent , especially from @entity34 's affiliates , " @entity34 's ability to conduct operations has been greatly diminished through cooperation on and off the battlefield , she added			1
" many of our successes against @entity34 would not have been possible without close cooperation between the @entity1 and @entity18 , " she said			1
in @entity4 , where security forces still have a long way to go before they can take on added responsibility , and where extreme poverty and corruption remain key challenges going forward , @entity6 noted that there are 7 million more children in school a decade after the @entity1 went to war in the country			1
nearly 40 % of @entity4 girls are in school today , she said , a sharp reversal from when the @entity3 ruled the country and prohibited girls from attending school			2
" working with our @entity4 and @entity18 partners is not always easy , but these relationships are advancing @entity1 's national security interests , " @entity6 said			1
" and walking away would undermine those interests			0
" the secretary of state expanded on the " fight , talk , build " strategy that she unveiled on her trip			0
as coalition and @entity4 forces have increased pressure on the @entity3 and @entity77 network operations inside @entity4 , @entity6 said , commanders remain concerned about the ability of these groups to launch attacks on coalition forces from safe havens in @entity18			1
in meeting with their counterparts in @entity18 last week , @entity6 , cia director @entity168 and the @entity170 chairman , gen. @entity169 , urged @entity18 to help squeeze the @entity105 on both sides of the @entity4 - @entity18 border			1
" we 're not suggesting that @entity18 sacrifice its own security			2
quite the opposite , " @entity6 told the @entity177 , noting the sacrifices the @entity18 military has made in the fight			1
@entity18 has a huge stake in getting @entity3 and other insurgents to the negotiating table as well , @entity6 said , and called on the @entity18 to do so through public statements and closing off the safe havens inside @entity18			1
" for our part , the @entity1 is working with the @entity4 government to conclude a new strategic partnership that will provide a framework for cooperation long after the transition is concluded in 2014 , " she said			2
" it will send a strong signal about our enduring commitment to the people of @entity4 and the future of the region			0
" the military battle against the @entity105 continues , @entity6 said , with a major military operation in @entity4 launched last week that captured or killed more than a hundred @entity77 operatives			1
as the @entity1 steps up its own efforts to pressure the @entity105 both financially and operationally , @entity18 plays a critical role in ratcheting up pressure on militants operating on its soil , she said			1
" we 're already working with the @entity18 to target those who are behind a lot of the attacks against @entity4 and @entity1 , " @entity6 said			1
" and i made it very clear to the @entity18 that the attack on our embassy was an outrage and the attack on our foreign operating base that injured 77 of our soldiers was a similar outrage			2
and it was in both instances terrible , but the fact is we avoided having dozens and dozens of wounded or killed			0
" lt. gen. @entity224 , the deputy commander of @entity1 forces in @entity4 , told reporters at the @entity227 on thursday that @entity18 officials have told him " they simply do n't have the capacity to take on " the @entity105			1
but more worrying , he said , may be " indications " seen by coalition forces that @entity77 attacks have originated from locations " in close proximity to some @entity18 outposts			1
" " i think the collaboration is , at least in some cases , local collaborations with the insurgents , and we talk very bluntly with our @entity18 counterparts about this , " @entity224 said			0
regarding @entity4 , @entity6 addressed questions about the reliability of @entity4 president @entity244 following comments last week in which @entity244 said he would side with @entity18 if a war between it and the @entity1 ever broke out			1
she said she asked @entity1 ambassador @entity248 to decipher the meaning behind @entity244 's remarks			2
those comments , @entity248 told her , were " taken out of context and misunderstood , " and harkened back to the long history of cooperation between @entity18 and @entity4 going back to the @entity255 invasion of @entity4			2
@entity6 said she had had a " productive meeting " with @entity244 last week in @entity257 , one that continued to build on cooperation on fighting insurgents while closely monitoring the success of the @entity4 - led reconciliation efforts with insurgents			1
as @entity4 and @entity18 both move to address change in their society , @entity6 said religious minority populations must be protected along with women , and racial minorities			2
" this is one of our biggest problems in the world right now , " she said			0
" there needs to be a greater acceptance of religious tolerance and in so many places there is no history of religious tolerance			0
" @entity6 told the committee it is important to build capacity for sustained economic growth and development in @entity4 , @entity18 and the rest of the region as a means to building lasting stability and security			2
" people need a realistic hope for a better life , a job and a chance to provide for their family , " she said			0
" so it is critical to our broader effort that civilian assistance continues in both @entity4 and @entity18			0
" as the administration works to strengthen oversight and effectiveness of its programs in the region , @entity6 told the committee she will be sending a comprehensive status update on civilian assistance to @entity4 and @entity18 next week that would detail plans for both short - term stabilization and long - term development programs			1
as coalition forces draw down their numbers ahead of a planned pullout in 2014 , @entity6 said , it is important for the @entity1 and its partners to support an @entity4 - led economic strategy that will improve agricultural productivity , develop natural resources , increase exports , and strengthen the country 's financial sector			1
she also noted the importance of promoting trade between @entity4 , @entity18 and its neighbors through the building of new infrastructure and other ways to move goods that will create new jobs across the region			0
as the @entity1 gradually reduces its military footprint in @entity4 over the next few years , @entity6 told the members of @entity339 , @entity336 must still remain engaged in the region			2
" @entity1 paid a heavy price for disengaging after the @entity255 left in 1989 , " she said			0
" we can not afford to make that mistake again			0
we have to be smart and strategic			0
and we have to work together to protect our interests			0
