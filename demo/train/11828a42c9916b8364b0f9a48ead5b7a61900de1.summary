@entity0 -- @entity2 is , to some conservatives , a party turncoat whose views on the use of military force and his chumminess with the president make many @entity11 ' skin crawl			1
the candidate for defense secretary is seen as @entity15 's most controversial nominee for his second - term cabinet			1
the former two - term @entity11 senator from @entity18 will likely face a tough @entity20 confirmation hearing thursday , but is expected to be confirmed , nevertheless			1
@entity15 's @entity16 : who 's in , who 's out ? but none of that is stopping conservative groups , and billionaire activist @entity26 , from pushing hard and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads to block the nomination			1
" if it 's a strategy , it does n't seem like a particularly enlightened one , " said @entity30 , a senior fellow at the @entity31 and co-author of the book " it 's even worse than it looks : how the @entity37 constitutional system collided with the @entity38			1
" " they almost certainly realize they 're going to lose and that he 'll be confirmed			1
" the effort is partly about making a public ado about @entity44 , @entity30 said			0
" they want to show some sort of collective reaction against it and a number of their key interests are pumped up about it , so they figure why not make a fight out of it ? " new ads from @entity58 group sound alarm bells at least two groups publicly released ads last week slamming the nominee			1
@entity37 for a @entity61 put out a 30 - second spot that urged viewers to call their senator and vote against @entity44 's confirmation " before it 's too late			1
" another group , the @entity67 , also revealed a new spot targeting @entity44 's record in the @entity20			2
@entity26 , the @entity70 conservative financier who also heads the @entity71 , was reportedly calling @entity11 senators personally to urge them to vote against @entity44 , according to the @entity73			2
but the opponents also have significant concerns about @entity44 's record			2
@entity44 in 2007 remarked that the " jewish lobby intimidated lawmakers			0
" republicans who are already uncomfortable with president @entity15 's policies toward @entity80 are hard - pressed to embrace a defense secretary with such views			1
five things @entity44 may be asked " for a lot of groups , especially @entity92 and conservative groups that care about @entity80 , this is a fundamental issue of right and wrong , " said @entity84 , former @entity85 press secretary under president @entity86 , @entity1 contributor and board member of the @entity71			1
" despite the fact that this is an uphill fight , groups are making the fight because they believe in it			1
" sens. @entity99 , @entity101 - @entity100 , and @entity102 , @entity103 , are perhaps the two highest - profile @entity92 senators who have announced their support for @entity44 after speaking privately with him in recent days			0
then there is @entity44 's criticism of the @entity109 and the @entity110			2
@entity44 has also faced some criticism on both sides of the aisle because of past positions he has taken on @entity116 and on @entity37 military action			0
and in 1998 he spoke of an ambassadorial nominee as being " openly , aggressively gay , " remarks for which he has since apologized			0
a view of what 's really behind @entity44 nomination fight and he has n't been sparing in his criticism of conservative and @entity11 figures , saying radio show hosts like @entity129 " try to rip everybody down " but " do n't have any answers , " and labeling @entity86 as callous on @entity131			1
" in a town that seems too focused too often on personalities and politics , this is a matter of conviction based on policy -- the wrong man for the job , " senate minority whip @entity132 , @entity133 , told @entity1			0
sen. @entity142 , @entity143 , prominent among politicians who have questioned @entity44 's suitability for the job , recently told @entity1 he will not exert his power to block @entity44 's nomination , but " i plan to make a judgment as to whether i think he 's appropriate to be secretary of defense or not			1
" but some @entity11 also believed that @entity44 , like @entity152 , was vulnerable , according to political experts			2
( @entity154 , the @entity37 ambassador to the @entity155 , withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state after drawing heavy criticism from @entity142 and other @entity11 over her public statements about the deadly september 11 attack on the @entity37 consulate in @entity163 , @entity164 )			2
" there is an element of strategic calculation going on here , " said @entity165 , a political science professor at @entity166			0
" they see him as being more vulnerable and they have a chance to stop this nomination or embarrass the president or at least make it more difficult for him			0
" @entity177 defends fellow @entity16 nominee @entity44 groups opposing @entity44 released new television ads recently with dire warnings of what they think could happen should @entity44 be confirmed			1
the first spot , from @entity37 for a @entity61 , uses themes that mimic a movie trailer for a spy / action thriller			0
the 30 - second spot says " we live in a dangerous world " and points to threats from @entity116 , @entity189 , and " even @entity190			0
" " but @entity15 's nominee for secretary of defense wants @entity37 to back down , " the narrator continues			1
" an end to our nuclear program			0
" the narrator then urges viewers to call their senator and vote against @entity44 's confirmation " before it 's too late			1
" @entity44 's other war @entity206 plans to run television ads in @entity0 and in certain states against @entity15 's nominee , the group said , as well as print ads , web spots , and a website			2
sources close to the group said they would spend about $ 500,000 to air the new ad on @entity1 and @entity217			0
they call it an " all the above " strategy that " will be nationwide , focused on the many disqualifying characteristics of the @entity222 nomination -- including not only his now well - known statements against @entity80 and his weak opposition to the @entity116 nuclear threat , but also his to be disclosed personal , business and ethical conflicts			0
" @entity142 moves from backer to skeptic on @entity44 increasingly , outside groups are going to get more involved in nomination fights , said @entity67 spokesman @entity233			2
" i think what have seen are outside groups get more involved , it has n't be unusual for outside groups to get involved in @entity239 nominations , " @entity233 said			2
" i think what you see now are additional groups getting involved in communicating about other nominations that are particularly problematic or controversial			0
@entity2 's nomination to defense secretary in this administration is a particularly troubling and controversial nomination			1
" the opposition is also about policy and personality			0
conservative groups take issue with @entity44 's policy positions , but also , " they do n't like the fact that he is a supporter of president @entity15 , " said @entity257 , an associate professor of political science at @entity166 in @entity259			1
" republicans have been playing opposition politics for four years and it 's not easy to come out of that mold , " he said			0
" in @entity44 's case there 's no love lost			0
they see him as someone as who turned on his party and they do n't want there to be any confusion that this is a real @entity11 going into the @entity15 @entity16			0
" opinion : reality check for @entity44 bashers @entity1 's @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .			0

conservative groups fight sen. @entity2 's confirmation as defense secretary
regardless , many believe he will be confirmed after thursday 's hearings
experts say they may be trying to show they can fight the good fight
