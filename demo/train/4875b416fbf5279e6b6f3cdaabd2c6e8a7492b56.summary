here , a member of @entity5 's army guards a drug seizure			2
while reports of the war on drugs in @entity5 are common and well - documented , the fact that tiny , landlocked @entity1 is no. 2 in the world may surprise some			1
but most countries in @entity20 , notably @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , cite @entity1 as the main source for the marijuana on their market , according to the @entity29 on @entity30			1
and two of those countries -- @entity21 and @entity22 -- report an increase in marijuana use due to the ready availability of the crop coming from @entity1			1
the reason marijuana is so abundant in @entity1 is simple , authorities there say : economics			2
" our reality is that we have large crops , large parcels of crops , " said @entity42 , the head of @entity1 's antidrug agency			2
" they do n't dedicate themselves to cultivating marijuana because they are narcotraffickers , but because of economic necessity			1
compared to the price of a traditional crop , they can make 500 percent more with this			0
" the @entity4 report says marijuana cultivation remains concentrated in @entity59 , where the largest producers are @entity5 and the @entity61			1
worldwide production for 2006 , the latest year for which figures are available , was around 41,400 metric tons , said the @entity4 's @entity65 2008			2
a metric ton equals 2,205 pounds			0

@entity1 produces more than half of the 10,000 metric tons marijuana grown in all of @entity20 , the @entity4 says			1
most of the growers are poor , and they cultivate their crops on nature preserves and private forests near where they live			0
while arrests for trafficking and selling drugs are common , @entity1 authorities say , there is not a single person in jail for growing and cultivating marijuana			1
authorities say it 's too hard to catch growers			1
" the size of an eradication operation involves moving many people and resources , " said @entity115 , a commander in @entity1 's special forces			2
" that gives [ growers ] the advantage insofar as detection of our forces coming into an area			0
normally , we go in , and they have abandoned the area			0
" in addition , each eradication raid costs around $ 25,000 , officials say			0
as a result , the government is asking for help from countries that may be affected by marijuana coming from @entity1			0
specialists say that marijuana grown in @entity1 is in great demand because of its high potency			0
