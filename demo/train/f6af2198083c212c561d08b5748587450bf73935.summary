-- those new to the cult of @entity3 may not realize it , but there once was a time when that iconic logo that shines from the top of @entity10 notebooks used to be positioned , well , upside down			1
anyone gazing at the back of an open powerbook or @entity14 saw @entity10 's logo balancing on its stem , almost as if in the middle of a pirouette			0
and now we know exactly why @entity10 opted for its original logo positioning : @entity21 , a former senior web app engineer and marketer at @entity10 , took to his blog sunday to disclose the story behind @entity10 's original design			1
@entity21 said that @entity10 staff confused by the design decision used the company 's anonymous internal question system @entity31 ? to ask " why is the @entity10 logo upside down on laptops when the lid is open ? " apparently , the @entity35 had discussed the issue of the @entity10 logo on the lid extensively			1
if the logo faces the user when he or she opens the laptop , then it 's upside down when the lid is up			2
and if the logo is right side up when the laptop is open , then it 's upside down to the user when he or she is looking to open it			2
@entity10 ceo @entity52 wanted to provide the best experience for the user , and so the @entity10 logo was initially placed to be upside down to onlookers			1
but the decision was reversed within a few years			0
" opening a laptop from the wrong end is a self - correcting problem that only lasts for a few seconds			0
however , viewing the upside logo is a problem that lasts indefinitely , " @entity21 wrote			2
smart move â € ” especially considering how often @entity10 notebooks appear in @entity65 productions			0
