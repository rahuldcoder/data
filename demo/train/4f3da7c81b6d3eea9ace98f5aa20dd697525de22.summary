@entity0 -- once again , a swelling chorus is calling on @entity3 to finally take action			1
" start the engines , @entity19 , " reads the colorful headline of a piece whose authors seem to assume that chancellor @entity9 commands the horsepower to save the euro , save the @entity13 and @entity14 recoveries , and -- as a throw - in -- save the @entity17 presidency			1
if only the @entity20 showed more leadership and found it in them to roll out " decisive policies , " argues @entity25 historian @entity24 , the everlasting eurocrisis could be ended			0
it is true that @entity3 is the pivot in the euro game			1
nothing happens if @entity3 does not consent			1
but the reverse is not true			0
if @entity3 wants something , it does not necessarily happen			1
that 's where the problem of @entity20 leadership starts			2
while much of the world looks at @entity3 as an ascending economic power within a declining continent , thereby shifting the regional balance of power in its favor , @entity20 themselves ( and certainly their current elected leader ) are keenly aware of the limits of @entity20 power			1
history has taught them painful lessons			0
since @entity3 's emergence as an industrial economy , it has been too big to be one of many in @entity55 and too small to dominate the continent			1
the latter proposition has been tested time and again and has usually ended in blood and tears somewhere in @entity60			0
among @entity20 , this experience has produced an ingrained skepticism toward the notion of @entity20 dominance , even if it comes in the form of a benevolent hegemony , based on the consent of the neighbors and transfer of wealth to them			0
@entity20 will be quick to point out that @entity3 is too small to take much of the rest of @entity55 onto its back			1
the @entity20 economy accounts for only 27 % of the eurozone 's output			0
the debt - to - gdp ratio hovers around an unhealthy 80 % and might jump to around 100 % given the commitments and guarantees to other @entity55 nations			2
nobody in @entity3 has forgotten the enormity of the task to bail out , reform and integrate @entity3 after the fall of the @entity85			1
to this very day , 3 % to 4 % of gdp are spent on transfers to the @entity88			0
in 1989 , @entity3 accounted for roughly a fourth of the population of @entity91 and no more than a fraction of its economic output			1
compare that to ailing @entity96 and @entity97 , whose combined economies rival @entity3 's today			1
therefore , it is a fantasy to assume that @entity3 alone can be @entity55 's white knight			1
given these constraints , @entity9 's willingness to lead @entity55 is remarkable			1
she has found a strategy to leverage @entity3 's limited power			1
first , @entity9 internationalized the @entity55 bailouts ; second , she broke down the effort into small steps to make them palatable to domestic constituencies in multiple countries ; third , she resurrected the @entity113 - @entity20 alliance as an engine for progress ; and , most importantly , she made the markets her friend and ally			1
in her assessment , no reform will happen in southern @entity55 without pressure from the markets			0
and there will be no pressure from the markets without limits to @entity20 largesse			2
unlimited and unconditional help would take away any incentive to reform			0
that is the reality in a monetary union without political union because the sovereign who bails out is different from the sovereign who reforms			0
@entity9 's strategy is paying initial dividends			1
structural reforms in southern @entity55 are well under way			0
but @entity9 's leadership has come at a price			1
aligning herself with the markets has meant maintaining relentless pressure on the southern countries while keeping the crisis simmering			0
that has resulted in costly and dangerous brinkmanship and created the myth that the pain of structural adjustment has to be borne by the southern @entity55 alone			0
and it has created a diplomatic challenge			0
even @entity3 's best friends do n't understand why the country opens its purse only at the last moment , but not a second earlier			1
they mistake strategy for passivity and a realistic assessment of @entity3 's wealth and power for stingy disciplinarianism			2
with the crisis coming to a head , the @entity20 approach will be put to the ultimate test			0
the markets seem to have concluded that no bazooka will end this crisis alone			0
they now bet on a so - called banking union as a first step toward centralizing power in @entity177			2
they seem to regard this form of minimal federalism as solution to the crisis			0
@entity9 endorses core - federalism , at least in principle , but she certainly can not deliver it alone			1
@entity3 may be a reluctant leader , but its followers are even more reluctant			2
@entity9 needs to persuade @entity113 , the most sovereignist country in continental @entity55 , to trade its @entity188 vision of @entity55 for a more centralized version with some sovereignty moving from @entity191 to @entity177			2
she needs to reassure smaller nations that core - federalism is not the equivalent of neo-colonialism			0
she needs to convince the southern periphery that joint debt and joint risk in @entity55 will mean joint control over the budget process , thereby limiting the reach of the nation state			0
and , finally , she needs to win over the @entity203 to play along with ( rather than obstruct ) a more centralized system of governance among the eurozone and even the @entity208 countries that the @entity203 themselves likely will never join			0
rather than being made the villain , @entity9 could use a little help from her friends across the @entity212			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			2

many are callling on @entity3 to lead effort to rescue the @entity219
@entity215 - @entity215 says there are limits to what @entity3 can do , given scope of problem
he says @entity3 is too big to be just another nation but too small to dominate the continent
author : @entity9 has taken positive steps to *strengthen* @entity219 , but needs help from others
