@entity0 , @entity1 -- as @entity4 took the stage at the @entity6 on tuesday night , she faced a similar task as @entity8 of presenting her husband as a father and family man , above his public persona in the political spotlight			1
" when people ask me whether being in the @entity15 has changed my husband , i can honestly say that when it comes to his character , and his convictions , and his heart , @entity17 is still the same man i fell in love with all those years ago , " mrs. @entity4 said			1
the first lady spoke on the convention 's opening night , exactly one week after @entity8 delivered what one @entity2 analyst called " political velvet , " an address at the @entity31 convention in @entity32 that took her sometimes robotic businessman husband , @entity33 , and turned him into a charismatic candidate who will be a champion of working - class @entity35			1
@entity4 has an easier job ahead of her in convincing voters of the president 's likability ; his favorability in this area ranks far above that of his @entity31 opponent			1
but she still worked to counter a perception that @entity4 is a cool and sometimes distant president who has been slow to build relationships outside the @entity15			1

" as president , you can get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people			0
but at the end of the day , when it comes time to make that decision , as president , all you have to guide you are your values , and your vision , and the life experiences that make you who you are , " she said			0
both @entity71 have talked openly about the importance of the family dinner and spending time with their two daughters , 11 - year - old @entity76 and 14 - year - old @entity71 , outside of the demands of the @entity15			0
campaign officials said @entity4 's focus would be to help augment the campaign 's strategy to use the convention as a way to show " what drives ( the president ) every day			1
" opinion : @entity4 has redefined black women a senior campaign official was more specific in the hours leading up to the speech			2
describing the first lady as " the most popular political figure in @entity35 , " the official said the aim was for her to highlight the president 's personal experience and serve as a " character witness " for her husband			1
she stuck to the planned themes			0
" i have seen firsthand that being president does n't change who you are -- it reveals who you are , " mrs. @entity4 said			1
she further touched on her own story , growing up on the south side of @entity104 , and shared stories about the values handed down by her parents			0
" we learned about gratitude and humility , that so many people had a hand in our success , from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean , and we were taught to value everyone 's contribution and treat everyone with respect , " mrs. @entity4 said			1
@entity4 convention speech dress dazzles , scores one thing @entity4 did n't do was go on the attack			1
" the first lady has not attacked political opponents in any way over the past four years , " the official said while speaking to @entity2 reporters covering the convention in @entity0 , @entity1			2
@entity131 , a professor of communications at @entity133 with a focus on media and first ladies , said she 's not surprised by the positive tone of the speech			2
" with the wives , they are n't there to provide the real red meat for the political junkies			0
there 's enough of that from other speakers , " @entity144 said			0
" their job is to reach out to the undecided voters and people who are tuning into the campaign for the first time -- so they want to keep it positive			0
" @entity144 said it will take more than the first lady 's speech to drum up the support necessary for her husband to win reelection			2
" she can definitely make a difference tonight , but ultimately when people go to the voting booths , they 're not voting for the wife , " @entity144 said			0
however , she faced a friendly audience on tuesday			0
what we learned from @entity170 of the convention the first lady is known as a warm , open woman whose latest favorable numbers in a @entity2 / @entity176 poll hit 65 %			2
@entity4 campaign officials describe her as the " most popular political figure in @entity35			1
" just four years ago , she was being portrayed as an afro - sporting , machine gun - toting , @entity182 figure fist - bumping her husband in a cartoon on the cover of the @entity185			0
she 's built her likeable reputation by tackling such issues as childhood obesity with her " @entity190 ! " campaign , holding several high - profile events at the @entity15 and appearing in public service announcements to encourage children and their parents to maintain an active lifestyle			2
she also started a vegetable garden on the grounds of the executive mansion			0
even her eye for fashion has gained admiration			0
mrs. @entity4 regularly opts to wear cardigans and skirts from such retail chains as @entity205 over high - end designers , putting her on similar shopping grounds as female middle - class voters			1
lines from speeches that killed she wore a dress by @entity213 designer @entity212 for her convention appearance			0
the women 's vote is especially key in this election , as @entity218 work to paint @entity33 and the @entity31 as out of touch with female voters			2
in a recent interview with @entity223 , the first lady indicated she 'd like to add women 's health issues to her list of causes if her husband is elected to a second term			2
@entity4 has stepped up in recent days to help fill the void left by her husband 's busy campaign schedule , meeting with family members of the victims in the @entity234 temple shooting in @entity235 , stumping for her husband on the campaign trail and calling for volunteers to rally voters in battleground states			1
