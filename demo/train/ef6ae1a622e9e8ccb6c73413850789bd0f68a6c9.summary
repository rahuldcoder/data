-- this holiday season , an ad campaign is selling clothes and challenging bigotry in @entity4			2
a poster of a turbaned and bearded man in @entity8 clothes with a woman hanging on his shoulder hit store windows and subway walls across the @entity4 last month as part of @entity8 's " @entity15 " ad campaign			1
the model is @entity17 , a @entity18 actor whose turban and beard is part of his faith			1
for the first time , a mainstream , nationwide ad presents a turbaned man as beautiful , even sexy			2
he is not a suspect , but a model ; not a terrorist , but a person with dignity ; not a foreigner , but an @entity4			0
the ad thrilled @entity18 @entity4 like me , who have worked for years to dismantle one of the most pernicious prevailing stereotypes in @entity4 culture : turban equals terrorist			1
nearly every person who wears a turban in the @entity4 is @entity18			1
many @entity18 wear five articles of faith , including kesh , long uncut hair that most men and some women wrap in a cloth turban			1
tragically , the turban meant to represent a commitment to service and justice marked @entity18 @entity4 as targets of hate			1
recently , the ad featuring @entity17 was found covered with racist graffiti on a @entity57 subway wall			1
" @entity59 " was crossed out to read " @entity58			0
" someone scrawled beneath it , " please stop driving taxis			0
" the racial epithets were familiar , but what happened next was altogether new			0
the photograph went viral on @entity66			2
within 24 hours , @entity8 set out to replace the defaced ads , made the ad its background image on @entity66 and @entity70 and released the statement , " @entity8 is a brand that celebrates inclusion and diversity			1
" the company 's response set off a chorus of # @entity78 posts			2
the story is a powerful example of how a groundswell of people can " make love " in response to hate			1
it 's a story we need now more than ever			0
twelve years after september 11 , 2001 , the stereotype of the turbaned and bearded terrorist is deeply entrenched in our social imagination			0
it shows up in profiling at airports , bullying in the school yard , violence on the streets , surveillance of houses of worship , and yes , graffiti on a @entity57 subway wall			0
in daily encounters , our minds default to stereotypes we have unwittingly absorbed			0
the most dangerous racial stereotypes trigger fear and animosity -- for example , african - americans as " criminal , " @entity111 as " illegal , " or @entity112 and @entity18 as " terrorist			1
" once a person is reduced to a stereotype , it becomes easier to harm them , or to permit harm to be done to them			0
but there is a powerful antidote to these stereotypes : the diversity of faces , voices and stories of real people that show our shared humanity			2
in the aftermath of the 2012 mass shooting in a @entity18 gurdwara in @entity135 , @entity136 , thousands of people wrote heartfelt letters in an outpouring of love and support to families who lost loved ones and signed petitions that led to a new government policy to track hate crimes against @entity18			1
this fall , after @entity149 professor @entity148 was brutally beaten in @entity57 , nearly 4,000 people of different faiths sent him prayers and messages online			0
and 11 days ago , when photographer @entity152 , a white @entity153 , saw racist graffiti covering a photograph of a @entity18 , he chose to take a photograph of the ad			1
he sent the photo to @entity160 writer @entity159 , who decided to post it on @entity66			0
others shared the photo , which prompted @entity8 to take a public stand			1
earlier this month , @entity8 employee @entity164 made the same choice when an irate customer complained about the @entity112 " terrorist " in the " do - rag			2
" he defended the ad and posted about it on @entity70			0
each of these individuals chose to fight for a community not their own			0
as a @entity18 @entity4 , these acts of courage deepen my commitment to do the same for others			2
companies should take note that taking a public stand against hate wins new customers			0
but it would be a mistake to miss the deeper lesson : we as individuals can no longer claim helplessness in the face of racism			0
in the digital era , the power to " make love , " not bigotry , lies in the palm of our hands			1
whether in response to a @entity18 model in a fashion ad , or a @entity202 crowned ms. @entity4 , new media give a new generation a chance to speak out for our vision of @entity4			1
the key is using our power to dismantle the stereotypes that shape our social landscape			0

*gap* ad featuring @entity18 *designer* and actor @entity17 was defaced
