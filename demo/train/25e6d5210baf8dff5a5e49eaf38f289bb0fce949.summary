@entity1 front man @entity0 killed himself at age 27 with a shotgun , a @entity6 police investigation concluded , and nothing has changed about that assessment 20 years after his death			1
but as the anniversary of @entity0 's passing approaches early next month , rumors have stirred on social media that police might be reopening the case			1
they are not , they said in a statement			0
but they released new photos of the crime scene			2
the photos do not include images of @entity0 's body			1
but the dingy , scratched images of syringes , a tainted spoon , a lighter and other personal belongings strewn across the floor will likely bring back sad memories for many fans			0
immortal attachment the attachment to the singer - songwriter , who was as much the front man of an evocative musical movement as he was of the band @entity1 , lives on			1
as apparently do theories of how the icon may have died			2
they include murder combined with rumors of personal entanglements			0
some fans seem unwilling to believe that @entity0 , whose name was synonymous with the movement called @entity46 that transformed rock , fled into the arms of death to escape the torments of depression and drug abuse in 1994			1
then news on thursday that a cold - case detective was reviewing @entity0 's file triggered a storm of digital chatter			1
but @entity58 was merely re-reading @entity0 's materials , just in case			1
" we knew with the 20th anniversary coming up and we knew there was going to be a lot of media interest , " he said			1
he also watched screened documentaries and read articles on the conspiracy theories			1
" i can see why people have questions , " @entity58 said			0
" but you can always point to something and say ' what if			0
' " grungy photos while reviewing the file , the detective , who usually searches archives for loose ends , found one -- four rolls of film taken at @entity0 's house that had never been developed			1
twenty years ago , police found no reason process them , since they had @entity85 snaps of the place where @entity0 perished			1
police had the 35 mm film developed , but the images are not new evidence			2
they just want to make them accessible to the public			0
fear of stoking conspiracy theories kept them from doing it earlier , @entity58 said			1
" sometimes people believe what they read â€” some of the disinformation from some of the books , that this was a conspiracy			0
that 's completely inaccurate , " he said			0
" it 's a suicide			2
this is a closed case			0
" many music legends died at the same young age of 27			0
they include @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			0
it takes many people a long time to let go of an artist who touched their hearts so strongly through their ears			0
haunting voice @entity0 's voice was as innovative @entity1 's interpretation of rock and in step with it			1
his velvety yet scratchy vocals continue in recordings to carry social disappointment and cynical ire in flats and sharps , all energized by fast - beat , electrified rock			0
just as it did then , when music fans first took note of it on @entity1 's breakthrough album " nevermind " in 1991 -- with its shocking album cover of a baby swimming naked underwater after a dollar bill on a fish hook			2
@entity0 's death ended a battle with hard drugs			1
his ashes were reportedly scattered in a @entity151 river and a @entity154 @entity153 temple			0
@entity1 band mates @entity155 and @entity157 eventually formed other bands			2
@entity0 's widow , @entity159 , stayed in the limelight with an acting career and legal problems surrounding her own drug problems			2
@entity164 , the couple 's daughter , has largely lived outside the public eye			0
what was unclear when @entity0 died was whether the music @entity1 created would endure or fade away			1
if it does fade , it may remain immortalized in one place -- @entity0 's hometown of @entity172 , @entity151			2
there visitors are greeted with a sign that reads -- in his honor -- " @entity177			0

conspiracy theories haunt the @entity1 front man 's death nearly 20 years ago
police release new photos , but they are not new evidence
" *mr.* @entity0 is still deceased and the case is still a suicide , " detective says
a cold - case detective only reviewed @entity0 file to prep for 20th anniversary interviews
