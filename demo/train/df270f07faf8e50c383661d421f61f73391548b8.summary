@entity0 , @entity1 -- for more than a decade , television journalist @entity3 has covered almost every major disaster in @entity1 's largest metropolis , from fires and typhoons to robberies and murders			1
his regular presence on the scenes of misfortune has inspired local viewers to jokingly call him @entity0 's face of tragedy			2
but it 's @entity3 's serious investigative reporting and energetic live presentations that have earned him widespread attention and respect			1
the 34 - year - old reporter for @entity21 is now arguably the most famous journalist in the city of 20 million residents			0
competitors profile him in their newspapers and magazines , while local websites are abuzz over his professional and personal life			0
one recent wednesday @entity3 raced to the city 's northeast during the morning rush hour after a tip that a security guard in a residential compound had died suddenly			1
" it could be just natural causes , but security guards are an underprivileged group			0
i want to do a bit of digging on their living and working conditions , " he told his cameraman in the car			0
" you get the shots first - he died inside the guardhouse at the entrance			0
" as the car pulled over , @entity3 leapt into action , as police and onlookers crowded a rather chaotic scene			1
yelling and shoving ensued after employees from the property management office turned hostile to the tv crew			0
undeterred , @entity3 kept cajoling and probing			1
the death seemed to have involved no foul play			0
@entity3 filed a live phone report in the car on his way back to the downtown newsroom -- and then it was on to the next case and another chance to tell the stories of the city 's less fortunate			1
" i feel it 's my responsibility to let the truth help promote social progress or solve social problems , " the @entity0 native said			2
" if i can do that , it gives me a sense of accomplishment			0
" @entity3 's coverage of a devastating apartment building fire that killed 58 people last november cemented his journalistic reputation			1
he was the first reporter to enter the charred high - rise after the fire was put out , capturing some extraordinary pictures of destruction amid the intense heat and smoke			0
but @entity3 -- a @entity87 member -- is guarded in talking about the parameters within which he reports			1
like all news outlets in @entity1 , @entity0 tv is state - run and falls under the same extensive system of control and censorship , both on air and online			0
" in the past few years , the media environment has become more relaxed for us , thanks to the growth of the internet and of public expectations , " said @entity3 , who tweets frequently about his stories and thoughts on @entity99 , @entity1 's equivalent of @entity100			1
with the internet blurring the boundary between local news and national or even international news , analysts say the work of reporters like @entity3 reflects greater social trends and show the difficulties ordinary people face in their daily life			1
" these reports do n't usually enrage or embarrass the authorities			2
that 's why they are more appealing to officials -- and make them more willing to acknowledge problems and try to address them , " said @entity120 , an assistant professor in journalism at @entity122 in the @entity123 and a long - time observer of @entity1 's news media			2
" sharp direct criticisms are necessary , but it 's often more effective to be gentle critics in @entity1 -- and the internal changes they prompt are more profound and long - lasting			2
" despite a 24/7 work schedule that has at times strained his marriage , @entity3 says he will keep probing , looking for the truth and giving a voice to the voiceless in order to promote social progress			1
" an ancient @entity1 saying says that a journey of a thousand miles is made up with all the small steps , " he said			0
" and i believe that			0
