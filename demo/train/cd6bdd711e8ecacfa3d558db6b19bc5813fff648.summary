-- it 's been a @entity2 notable for late drama in most of the matches and a high number of goals scored , particularly in the preliminary stages			2
new heroes like @entity9 of @entity10 have also emerged , while modern technology has been introduced for the first time to decide if the ball has crossed the goal line			0
but for some , the real star of @entity16 2014 comes in a small spray can , a " magic foam " which allows referees to make sure players retreat the requisite 10 yards ( 9.15 meters ) when a free kick is awarded against them			1
referees have been brandishing the spray with flourish , pacing out the distance then marking it with a line of the spray , over which they can see if a player has edged too close to the taker of the free kick			2
it has also been used to mark the exact location of a free kick , stopping players from gaining an advantage by edging forwards nearer the goal			0
due to its properties of butane , isobutane , propane gas , water and other chemicals , the line on the pitch made by the spray quickly disappears			1
it is also environmentally friendly as it is biodegradable and does n't damage the pitch of the atmosphere			0
" it is very good , " @entity51 president @entity50 said of the spray 's impact			2
" it disciplines the players			0
" it gives the attacking teams the chance to take the free kick from the real distance , not from where the wall is always moving			0
" some players have said now we have nine meters but in our leagues we have six or seven meters			0
" the brainchild of a former amateur player from @entity16 , with a @entity70 - sounding name , @entity71 , it was used as first used as far back as 2000 in a junior football tournament in the @entity16 city of @entity74			1
the spray was then known as " @entity77 , " but after @entity71 joined forces in 2006 with an @entity79 , journalist @entity80 , to refine the product , it has been renamed " 9.15 @entity82			1
" the big breakthrough for the spray came in 2012 , when the @entity85 ( the law - making body of the game ) authorized the product for international use			0
@entity51 tested the spray in 2013 at its under - 17 and @entity90 and gave the go - ahead for this year 's senior showpiece soon after			1
" it is literally a dream come true to see 9.15 @entity82 being used at this @entity2 and seen by billions of people across the globe , " said @entity71			1
judging by its success , with statistics pointing to more goals coming from free kicks and less time needed to take them , the little spray cans are set to be a permanent addition to the back pockets of referees for many years to come .			2
