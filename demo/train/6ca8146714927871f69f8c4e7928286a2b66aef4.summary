-- days ahead of national elections , @entity2 prime minister @entity1 has announced plans to rehire 20,000 former @entity2 army officers who served under former leader @entity6			1
the officers will be reinstated into the new @entity2 army , said an official with the ministry of defense			1
the move garnered criticism as being a political ploy and was surprising in some circles after @entity1 's campaign rhetoric against @entity6 's @entity16			1
several candidates who planned to stand in the upcoming election have been banned by the country 's @entity19 because of evidence of them " glorifying " the @entity16			2
@entity23 lawmaker @entity22 said @entity1 was simply trying to secure more votes			0
" this contradicts his anti-baathist election campaign and it is very obvious that he wants to appeal to voters			0
" a few weeks after the 2003 invasion of @entity2 , top @entity30 administrator @entity29 dissolved baathist institutions , including the @entity2 army , that were viewed as threats against building a new @entity2 society			1
the @entity16 was declared illegal and many @entity36 lost their government jobs			2
as a result , the @entity38 became disenfranchised -- many embraced the rising insurgency and stayed away from the first elections in 2005			2
the tensions led to pitched battles between @entity45 and @entity36 in the streets of @entity47 and other @entity2 cities			0
over the years , the @entity30 has worked to get on the good side of the @entity36 , bring them into the country 's new political culture , and persuade them to accept the new @entity2			1
in a separate development , a member of an @entity56 in @entity2 cell responsible for several dozen assassinations in and around @entity47 has been arrested , the @entity30 military said			0
@entity2 security forces seized the militant in a rural area about 38 kilometers , or almost 24 miles , southwest of the capital			0
the cell is believed to have conducted nearly 50 assassinations			0
the arrest occurred ahead of @entity2 's march 7 national elections , and the military says intelligence reports indicate that the @entity56 in @entity2 fighters " are increasingly staging politically motivated assassinations " to undermine the @entity2 government and the upcoming polls			1
@entity0 's @entity73 contributed to this report .			0
