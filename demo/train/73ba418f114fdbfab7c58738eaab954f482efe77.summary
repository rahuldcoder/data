-- the kills celebrated the 10th anniversary of their first live gig with a concert / blowout party in @entity5 this past weekend			2
other rockers might not remember the exact date of their first gig , but it 's easy for singer @entity10 to recall : she has the date tattooed on her hand			1
you probably have n't heard the kills on the radio			2
but you may have heard their songs on tv shows like " @entity19 , " " @entity20 , " and " cops " and not known it			2
and if you 're into more mainstream rock , or celebrity gossip , you 've probably read about @entity10 and @entity25 @entity24 for other reasons			1
@entity10 moonlights as the lead singer for one of @entity31 's two @entity30 bands , the @entity32			1
@entity24 married supermodel @entity33 last year in a wedding breathlessly covered by the @entity36 press			1
despite their busy lives outside the kills , @entity37 and @entity24 still passionately focus on the band that changed their lives			1
@entity24 said when the duo started as " an odd two - piece social group ... i think our souls knew we would still be doing it [ 10 years later ] , but i do n't think our brains did			1
" " this band might never be a global phenomenon , but it 's the most successful thing in the world to me , " @entity24 said			1
@entity52 brought the two together			2
when @entity54 native @entity10 was touring @entity36 with her band , they stayed in a @entity57 flat that happened to be below @entity24 's apartment			1
" i 'd be making a noise , playing guitar and stuff , and unbeknownst to me , she was outside my window , listening , " @entity24 recalled , " when we actually first spoke , she probably knew a lot more about me than i realized , because she 'd been sort of listening to me playing for about a week			1
" @entity10 soon moved to @entity57 to join forces with @entity24 , but there was one problem : she did n't play an instrument			1
" we presumed we would be a normal band with this orthodox band set up , with a drummer and a keyboard player and a bass player , " @entity24 said			1
" while we were talking about it , we 'd also be writing songs together			2
then , we 'd talk further about what kind of drummer we wanted			2
then , we 'd play some more music			2
a week would go by , and two weeks			2
then , a month , and two months			2
and we 'd got a mountain of songs and we listened back to ourselves , and it sounded like a band , and we just stopped talking about meeting other people			0
" @entity10 said sounding like a band was n't so easy at first , " he kind of had to re-learn guitar entirely because of me , because we were a two - piece band and i did n't know how to play anything			1
so , he had to develop this guitar style that was like playing bass and guitar at the same time to compensate for me			0
" ten years later , @entity10 plays guitar , drums , and keyboards in concert , as well as ferociously prowling the stage as the lead singer			1
while the kills are incorporating two drummers into some songs on their current tour , they play many tunes the way they 're created on record , with just the two kills and a drum machine			2
@entity10 worries that opens up a lot of possibilities for error on stage			1
" two of us playing to a drum machine is like walking a tightrope , because if you take the wrong turn at any point , you 're off , and you 're off somewhere all by yourself ... and that 's kind of it for the song , " she said			0
despite those fears , you should n't expect to hear ornate orchestration in any @entity100 songs anytime soon			0
" i think it 's more important what you leave out of a song than what you put in it , " @entity24 said			1
" the only thing you need on a song is that attitude and that burning electricity			0
you do n't need layers of music or , you know , a thousand drums , or string sections			2
you do n't even need an electric guitar to be electric			0
" " i think that minimalist sound is really attractive to us , just kind of instinctually , " @entity10 added			1
" we 'll try a lot of things and we usually get rid of almost everything			0
we just kind of leave the stuff that we think is important , because it sounds the best to us			0
" that minimalism has been a hallmark of edgy rock bands for more than 45 years , since the @entity152 , the " house band " for @entity155 's factory in the ' 60s , " created " the sound			0
when @entity24 and @entity10 first met , they bonded over a shared love of the @entity155 scene			1
" all that time was so romantic and beautiful , because there were n't a bunch of bands that were part of the scene			0
there were n't a bunch of artists that were part of the scene			0
it was just the @entity152 and these kinds of freaks , and these people with fake names , and these drag queens , and @entity155 , and then , these photographers , " @entity10 said			1
" that appealed to us so much , because that 's kind of what we grew up doing			0
we wanted to do everything			0
we did n't just want to do one thing			0
we did n't just want to be in a band			0
we did n't just want to be artists			0
" the kills display multimedia skills , producing artwork and photos for their cd jackets , creating pamphlets of @entity189 to hand out at concerts and even generating the concepts for many of their music videos			1
the disturbing video for 2008 's " @entity200 " depicts the couple beating each other in back alleys and bedrooms			0
a lot of articles over the years have alluded to sexual tension between @entity24 and @entity10 , but both insist romance has never been part of their dynamic			1
" i think it 's really difficult for people to see a friendship -- not just a friendship between a man and a woman , but a creative , productive relationship			0
people do find it really hard to see that it could be possible , without there being some kind of regular love interest around it , " @entity24 said			1
" i always wanted to be in this kind of creative , artistic relationship that was beyond anything else , and it 's like we willed it			0
we kind of yearned for it and we willed it , and we got it			0
" they also yearned for -- and are getting -- more mainstream recognition			0
" it 's incredible when you go somewhere like @entity233 and kids are going bananas to you and you 've never been there before , " @entity24 said			1
" equally , when @entity238 names this band i still see as this little sort of underground band , names [ the @entity100 ' latest album @entity242 ] as one of the best albums of [ 2011 ] , it means the world to me			0
" " i have this very strong feeling that we need to be part of the world , " @entity10 said			2
" if you 're not , what are you doing ? "			0
