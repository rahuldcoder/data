-- years before @entity2 became the @entity3 , he was a mechanical engineering student at @entity4 , where he took a course with astronomer @entity6			1
@entity6 , who was instrumental in the planning of @entity9 missions to other planets and became widely known for his research , writing and public television series , was one of the founders of the @entity15			1
and his student dutifully signed up to become a member			2
" i 've been a member for over 30 years			2
and now i 'm the head guy			2
it 's quite odd , " a surprised - sounding @entity2 told @entity0 in an interview in march at the @entity20 conference in @entity21 , @entity22			1
so today , the bow - tied , jauntily professorial @entity2 has a new role aside from his television work as a popularizer of science : as the society 's chief executive , he 's become a leading voice against the @entity32 administration 's proposed $ 300 million cut in @entity9 's planetary exploration budget			1
and it 's a subject about which he 's passionate			2
remembering retired @entity9 astronaut , @entity35			1
" this is a deep , deep concern			2
all the budgets are being cut			0
we gotcha , budgets are being cut , budgets are being pulled back , yes , yes , all good , " he says , acknowledging the pressure to cut spending			0
" but investment in space stimulates society , it stimulates it economically , it stimulates it intellectually , and it gives us all passion			0
everyone , red state , blue state , everyone supports space exploration			1
so i understand the budget has got to be cut , but something has gone a little bit wrong			2
" @entity2 says the planetary exploration budget , facing a reduction of 21 % from this fiscal year 's budget , is taking a deeper cut than other parts of @entity9			1
" this would n't matter			0
except it 's not a faucet			0
it 's not a spigot you can turn off and on			0
you stop planetary exploration , those people who do that extraordinary work are going to have to go do something else			1
" his worry is that the @entity75 is in danger of losing its unmatched scientific expertise to plan and execute missions to other planets			1
" to try to really land a spacecraft really on another world is really difficult , and if we lose that ability , it 's going to be heartbreaking , " says @entity2 , who adds that it could take decades to recoup			1
@entity2 makes another argument for investing in exploring the solar system			1
he says there are two kinds of natural disasters that can be prevented : one is climate change , and the other is the @entity93 getting hit by an asteroid			0
telescope aims to head off asteroids ' impact on @entity93 " if the @entity93 gets hit by an asteroid , it 's game over			0
it 's control - alt - delete for civilization			0
" @entity2 says he figures " sea jellies , squid , cockroaches will be fine , " but an asteroid could wipe out humankind			1
" so what we want to do is to develop the capability to redirect , to deflect an asteroid , ever so slightly			0
if you 're going to do that , you 've got to have space exploration			2
and sooner or later , you 're going to want to send people out there to look around			0
it 's just our nature , and one day it would be exciting to send people to @entity119			0
" @entity9 is in the midst of active exploration of @entity119			1
in august , @entity122 , the @entity122 , is due to land on the planet 's surface			0
@entity125 , @entity9 's associate administrator for communications , says the rover is the " @entity128 of @entity119 missions " and " the most sophisticated scientific system ever sent to another planet			1
" space junk diplomacy its mission is to determine whether the red planet could have ever hosted life			0
@entity125 said in june that the agency is reformulating its @entity119 strategy in light of budget constraints and scientific priorities and " the president 's challenge of sending humans to @entity119 in the 2030s			2
" @entity2 says his concern is n't about current missions but about whether the next series of missions and the ones beyond that will have enough funds to proceed			1
taking a larger view , @entity2 says there are two questions everyone should ask themselves at some time in their lives : " where did we come from ? and are we alone ? " " to seek the real answers to those questions , you have to explore space , and if you stop exploring , if you say , ' i do n't care ; i 'm not going to look up and out and beyond the horizon , ' what does that say about you ? it 's not good , " @entity2 said			1
" if we found life on @entity119 , or evidence of life on @entity119 , it would change the way everybody thinks about everything			0
it would change the way you think about your place in space			0

@entity2 , the @entity3 on tv , also heads @entity15
he is *speaking* out against proposed cuts in @entity9 planetary exploration budget
@entity2 says the @entity75 has unmatched expertise in landing spacecraft on other planets
if @entity75 loses its edge , it could take decades to *rebuild* , @entity2 says
