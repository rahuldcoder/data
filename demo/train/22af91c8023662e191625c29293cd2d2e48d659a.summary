@entity0 -- the @entity2 on monday turned away an appeal from an @entity5 judge who wanted to post a copy of the biblical @entity7 in his courtroom			1
the case was among hundreds disposed of by the justices , who returned to start a new term after a three - month recess			1
another separate , high - profile petition involved a death row prisoner challenging his conviction in the murder of an 11 - year - old @entity21 girl			2
the @entity5 case was brought by the @entity23 , which had successfully prevented @entity25 common pleas judge @entity24 from posting another copy of the @entity7			1
he first hung the well - known passage from the @entity29 in 2000 , alongside a copy of the @entity32 's @entity31 , and referred to both as " the rule of law , " according to court documents			2
the @entity2 five years ago agreed the display violated the @entity32 's ban against " establishment " of religion , and ordered the poster removed			0
but the judge soon tacked up another display , called " @entity43 , " that included the @entity7 in a section called " @entity45			1
" a separate section called " @entity47 " included sources such as the @entity49			0
it was that poster the justices monday again rejected for public viewing in a government building			2
@entity24 's attorney , @entity54 of the @entity55 had urged the justices to intervene			1
" it 's time for the high court to set the record straight : the display by @entity62 is a constitutionally permissible method of explaining his legal and moral philosophy , the same philosophy embraced by our founders , " he said			2
the @entity23 countered the poster was a clear expression of the judge 's religious views , and a clear violation of the long - standing principle of separation of church and state			1
in a separate appeal , the justices asked @entity21 to weigh in with a response from an appeal by death row inmate @entity80			1
the former mechanic was convicted in the horrific murder of @entity83 of @entity84 , who was abducted from near a car wash in 2004			0
dramatic surveillance video from a nearby security camera showed the girl being confronted by a man later identified as @entity80 , who was on probation at the time			0
the man then grabbed @entity83 and brought her to his car			0
that footage aired on television around the country , and was used by the @entity96 and local police to launch a desperate search			0
@entity80 was later convicted and sentenced to death			0
the tragedy prompted congressional legislation , @entity102 , which tightens parole rules for sex offenders , while also creating an alert system to notify parents when criminal activity is taking place nearby			0
the high court had rejected an earlier appeal from @entity80 in june , but the inmate filed another federal claim , saying his right to confront witnesses at trial was violated when prosecutors introduced dna evidence implicating him			1
a panel of experts talking about the forensic work did not include the lab technician who actually performed the test			0
state courts have been at odds on whether such non-testimonial evidence is acceptable , particularly in capital cases			0
the justices last week accepted review of a case from @entity130 raising similar issues			2
the @entity21 case is @entity80 v. @entity21 ( 09 - 10755 )			1
the @entity5 @entity7 case is @entity24 v. @entity23 ( 10 - 1512 ) .			1

an @entity5 judge wanted to post the @entity7 in his courtroom
the court rejected the appeal ; the @entity23 and @entity55 were on *opposite* sides of the case
the justices ask @entity21 to respond to an appeal in a @entity21 capital case
