for a big chunk of the @entity2 , the @entity0 turned to the @entity3 for many of its most important spy missions			0
the jet - black jet could fly at more than three times the speed of sound at altitudes of 85,000 feet , faster and higher than anything adversaries had to counter it			1
the last of the @entity11 flew in 1999 , and the @entity13 military has n't had anything close since			0
now , @entity16 , the maker of the @entity3 , says the " @entity17 , " the @entity15 , is in the works , and it will be twice as fast as and way more lethal than its father			1
that 's because the @entity15 will be designed to launch missiles , something the @entity3 did n't do			1
" even with the @entity3 , at @entity28 , there was still time to notify that the plane was coming , but at @entity31 , there is no reaction time to hide a mobile target , " @entity24 , @entity16 's program manager for hypersonics , told @entity26			1
the publication provided the first detailed look at the @entity15 plans last week			1
@entity37 launches new stealth destroyer " hypersonic aircraft , coupled with hypersonic missiles , could penetrate denied airspace and strike at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour , " @entity24 said in a news release			2
and , by the way , the @entity15 is envisioned as a drone , unlike the original blackbird with its crew of two : a pilot and a reconnaissance officer to operate its radar jammers and spy gear			1
" the @entity3 was developed using 20th - century technology			0
it was envisioned with slide rules and paper			0
it was n't managed by millions of lines of software code			0
and it was n't powered by computer chips			0
all that changes with the @entity15 , " @entity16 says			1
a smaller - scale model of the @entity15 could begin testing in five years and be in the air in 10 , @entity24 told @entity26			2
the full - scale @entity15 could be operational by 2030 , according to @entity16			1
if it comes to fruition , one thing the @entity15 wo n't be is stealthy			2
the design needed for the @entity31 speed does n't allow for such construction , according to the @entity26 report			2
" speed is the new stealth , " @entity26 quoted @entity68 , engineering and advanced systems vice president at @entity16 's @entity70 , as saying			1
" speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades			2
the technology would be a game - changer in theater , similar to how stealth is changing the battle space today , " @entity24 said in the statement			0
of course , none of this will fly without money , and that will probably be up to taxpayers			0
" we have been continuing to invest company funds , and we are kind of at a point where the next steps would require large - scale testing , which would significantly increase the level of investment we 've had to make to - date , " @entity24 told @entity26			0
" between @entity95 ( the @entity95 ) and the @entity0 , it would be highly likely they 'd have to fund the next steps			0

@entity15 could fly six times the speed of sound
" @entity102 " would be a drone , be able to launch missiles
aircraft could be operational by 2030 , @entity16 says
