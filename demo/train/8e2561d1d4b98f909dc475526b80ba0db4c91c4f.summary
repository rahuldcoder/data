@entity0 -- the man tapped as @entity4 's next intelligence chief faces allegations of drug trafficking and torture that stem from his work as a powerful official in the rough - and - tumble @entity10 - birthplace of @entity11 , according to testimony from a top @entity14 diplomat and other sources familiar with the new appointee			1
a staunch @entity19 loyalist and @entity21 fighter known for his experience and heavy - handed tactics , @entity17 is the country 's minister of tribal and border affairs who oversees its southern security forces			1
on sunday evening , president @entity19 officially nominated the @entity27 leader as head of the @entity29			1
but last week , top - level government leaks regarding the president 's choice stirred controversy in the region and protest from rights groups			1
dogged by accusations of abuse and trafficking , @entity17 must still pass a legislative vote of confidence before assuming the coveted leadership post atop the country 's main intelligence agency			1
@entity4 president dismisses intelligence chief amid cabinet shakeup much of the concern stems from the testimony of @entity50 , @entity14 's former deputy ambassador to @entity4 , who worked directly with @entity17 while he was governor of @entity11 from 2005 to 2008			1
in 2009 , @entity50 testified before @entity14 's parliament that his team had uncovered " very credible " evidence of torture being used by @entity4 authorities in @entity11 , which allegedly included @entity17 's direct involvement			1
" he was known to us very early on , in may and june 2006 , as an unusually bad actor on human rights issues			0
he was known to have had a dungeon in @entity63 , his previous province , where he used to detain people for money , and some of them disappeared , " @entity50 said in his testimony			0
" he was known to be running a narcotics operation			0
he had a criminal gang			0
he had people killed who got in his way			0
" the @entity14 diplomat also testified that " in @entity11 we found out that ( @entity17 ) had indeed set up a similar dungeon under his guest house			1
" " he acknowledged this			0
when asked , he had sort of justifications for it , but he was known to personally torture people in that dungeon , " said @entity50			2
a high - level diplomatic source , who declined to be named , said a more recent independent review offered " credible evidence that ( @entity50 's account of @entity17 had indeed ) occurred , " though the source declined to elaborate beyond what was already in the diplomat 's public testimony			1
the @entity14 inquiry was formed as a result of a complaint into whether detainees captured by @entity14 soldiers and handed over to @entity4 authorities in @entity11 were being mistreated			1
the investigation led to a new agreement in which @entity14 officials were allowed greater access to @entity11 prisons , but it also shed light on the nature of @entity103 's partnerships in the volatile @entity4 south			1
@entity14 's forces had been largely deployed to @entity11 , considered the @entity10 heartland , which borders @entity107 and is thought to be essential to @entity4 national security			1
a second source , who agreed to be identified only as a former @entity111 official with considerable knowledge of @entity11 , said " it was widely believed that ( @entity17 ) got his hands dirty and did some of this ( torture ) himself			1
" but @entity17 has rejected those accusations , blaming them on enemies threatened by his success			1
" i know there is nothing ( in terms of evidence ) , " he said last week			0
" this is just propaganda about me			0
" @entity19 's office also called the accusations false			1
but @entity128 weighed in on friday and called on the @entity4 president to " drop reported plans to appoint a senior official linked to torture , " referring to @entity17			1
" he 's viewed as a pretty brutal , but reliable person to be fighting @entity10 , " said the high - level diplomatic source , who declined to be named citing the sensitivity of the matter			0
" when you see he was put into @entity11 after @entity139 got killed , that 's significant			0
" @entity139 , the president 's half - brother and once a powerful southern political figure , was gunned down by a bodyguard in @entity11 last year			1
the @entity10 claimed responsibility , though reports later surfaced that the killing may have instead stemmed from an internal dispute			0
still , his death sent shockwaves across @entity4 at a time when @entity10 fighters appeared to be using assassination tactics against high - profile targets , many of whom were allied to the president			0
analysts say @entity17 's redefined role over southern security forces may have afforded @entity19 a needed ally , particularly in the absence of his younger brother			1
but it may have also cast @entity17 as a more prominent figure leading up to the nation 's presidential elections , which are slated for 2014			1
" one possible course of action is that @entity19 tries to retain power through a successor who is beholden to him -- sort of the @entity170 model , " said @entity166 , a senior associate at the @entity167 , referring to how @entity169 president @entity168 anointed @entity170 as his successor in 2006			1
" @entity17 is a candidate for that role			2
moving him up to a more prominent and responsible position would advance that possibility , " said @entity166 , who first met @entity17 when he was appointed as @entity11 governor in 2005			2
but abuse allegations surrounding the former governor are expected to renew old questions from @entity111 allies , just as @entity103 eyes its 2014 withdrawal from @entity4			0
considered an ambitious man despite dropping out of @entity190 , @entity17 joined legendary @entity10 - fighter @entity191 , known as the " @entity191 , " before the @entity193 - led invasion in 2001			2
he later worked in conjunction with @entity195 in southern @entity4 , according to a former senior @entity4 official , who declined to be named , citing security concerns			0
" he 's thought of as a do - er , a field person			0
not a desk person , " the ex-official said			0
" and he is also one of the only ministers i know to travel to @entity11 by road , " a reference to the region 's perilous roadways that are often lined with improvised explosives			0
but the former official added that he knew of no evidence to support allegations of @entity17 's direct involvement in torture			1
" yes , there were people beneath him who made mistakes , but i have no evidence that he was directly involved , " he said			0
the @entity219 in @entity4 estimates that torture has occurred with considerable frequency in @entity4 , and says it is a particular problem within the country 's intelligence services			2
it found " compelling evidence that 125 detainees ( 46 % ) of the 273 detainees interviewed who had been in @entity29 detention experienced interrogation techniques at the hands of @entity29 officials that constituted torture , " according to a @entity219 report			1
torture , the @entity219 said , " is practiced systematically in a number of @entity29 detention facilities throughout @entity4			1
" the @entity29 is @entity4 's main intelligence agency and reports directly to the president and @entity238			1
if confirmed , @entity17 's ascension atop the agency would bring a practiced @entity10 - fighter and well - connected senior official to a security post critical to the president 's inner circle			1
others who know him say allegations of abuse and drug trafficking are unfounded			1
" he 's too smart for that , " said the former chief of staff of @entity11 's chief of police			0
the former chief of staff , who goes by the last name @entity4 but asked to keep his first name anonymous for security reasons , said @entity17 " did n't need private prisons			2
" " he had the @entity29 , " @entity4 said			2
" and he was really good at intelligence in @entity11			0
" @entity4 also noted that the regional @entity29 chief reported directly to both @entity262 headquarters and to @entity17 , a practice thought to be commonplace in @entity4			1
private detention centers did exist , and likely still do , he said , but just not under @entity17			2
for instance , a former @entity11 governor -- prior to @entity17 -- had once maintained a private prison in @entity11 across from his office , said @entity4 , who noted residents were " constantly complaining to us " that they or their friends or their family members had been tortured			2
" people were taken out and questioned , hanged to death and beaten to death , " he said			0
however , the prison was apparently removed when @entity17 assumed power in 2005 , @entity4 added			2
@entity1 could not independently verify that account			0
if confirmed , @entity17 would take over from @entity280 , 42 , whose two - year term has expired			2
@entity280 's predecessor , longtime intelligence chief @entity282 , is now an opposition leader			0
meanwhile , @entity19 on sunday also floated replacement possibilities at the @entity284 , which have been vacant for weeks			2
@entity286 , a well - connected @entity287 leader with robust ties to the @entity4 army and police , was tapped to head up the @entity291 , @entity19 's office reported			1
but that move is also expected to stir discord among parliament lawmakers who recently dismissed @entity286 from his post atop the @entity296			0
" this is classic @entity19 , and trial balloon floating , " said @entity297 , a senior fellow at the @entity298			2
" it could be to placate @entity302			0
but it 's also entirely plausible that he 's floating an idea that he expects to be shot down			0
" " in @entity4 politics , these things are often four levels of gamesmanship , " said @entity297			0
the cabinet shakeup comes just one month after @entity19 earned international praise for a sweeping set of proposed reforms meant to stem corruption in the war - wracked country			2
but his moves have also raised new questions about @entity4 's rising political players , particularly those expected to take over in the wake of the @entity103 withdrawal .			0
