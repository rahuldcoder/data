@entity0 -- @entity1 chief political correspondent @entity2 will moderate the second presidential debate , to be held tuesday at @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , the first woman to do so in two decades			1
@entity2 , host of @entity1 's " @entity8 , " was asked about the town hall format , her role , her expectations for how she 'll manage the face - off between president @entity13 and @entity15 challenger @entity14 , and her feelings about being selected for the honor			1
you can ask @entity2 about her experience through @entity20			1
@entity1 : does a town hall debate present unique challenges and opportunities for the candidates because it 's not your normal debate behind a podium ? @entity2 : it does , because they are going to have roughly 80 people , as i understand it , looking at them in addition to me			1
you know and i know it is very easy for politicians to run over a reporter -- they do n't care			0
there is no price to be paid for being rude to a reporter , not answering the question			0
but 80 undecided voters looking at you , and some of them getting up and going , " well , what about this ? " it 's just harder to dodge			2
there 's also the whole -- you know , if you want to get into the optics of it , there 's the whole wandering around the stage , and feeling their pain , and there 's this whole kind of other set of expectations that we 've come to want , or at least talk about afterwards , that now goes with modern television debates			1
@entity1 : how is a town hall debate different than other debates in terms of challenges and opportunities that presents itself ? @entity2 : the challenge is that they 've got to connect not just with the people looking into the television and watching them , but the people who are on the stage with them			1
some 80 or so undecided voters are chosen by @entity77 , so they have to keep those folks in mind			0
it 's a much more intimate and up - close adventure with voters than talking through a reporter			2
@entity1 : now , we heard a lot with all these debates about style versus substance			1
does it become even more about style because it 's a town hall ? @entity2 : no , i think it 's both about substance and style no matter what the debate is , and you do n't know which it 's going to be most about until it 's over			1
if a voter gets up and says , " i am unemployed and i have n't had a job in x amount of months and this happened and that to my health care , " there has to be substance to that answer			0
you ca n't just be about , " oh my gosh , that 's terrible , i 'm so sorry to hear your story			2
" it 's got to be , you know , give them something			2
so i think it 's both , and i think there is a lot in common with the debates , in that we 're not going to know until after the debates are over -- where this is something where the message came through with style , or in substance , or maybe a little of both , which is generally the case			1
@entity1 : i guess with or without the podium and with the audience interaction it seems like you would kind of , everything would carry more weight			1
@entity2 : well , i think it does in a sense of these are real people that -- the audience does n't necessarily relate to either presidential candidates or media			1
but they do relate to 80 people sitting on a stage that look like them , and maybe have stories similar to theirs			2
and so they can kind of see themselves through the town hall meeting participants			0
and i think that 's where a candidate has to make a connection , because the candidate that makes a connection with the person asking the question is also making a better connection with the person back at home			2
@entity1 : there is some sense , one of the people i interviewed talked about how a town hall setting is viewed maybe as a little bit more freewheeling , free - flowing , less predictable because of the audience interaction			1
do you buy that ? or do candidates always go back to their script and their talking points ? @entity2 : whenever candidates get a chance , they will return to their talking points			1
and i think that 's where we come in , like why i said , " we know this			2
but the question was not oranges , it was apples , so could you please address apples , that would be good			0
" so yes , i think the instinct of any politician anywhere is to go back to their comfort zone , which is the talking point			0
but i think it is more difficult to stay in that zone when you have a person with a story asking you a question that relates to their life			0
@entity1 : what past debate moments are the most memorable ? @entity2 : what 's interesting to me is when i look back at the debates , there are things that are kind of monumental			1
now , one of them is more history to me than having actually having seen it , and that is when @entity209 talked about @entity210 as being free , and of course it was behind the @entity213			0
and this was seen as a monumental mistake			0
but you go from that sort of thing , all the way to @entity220 , the father , looking at his watch			0
it 's just , there 's something about these debates that magnifies things that perhaps you do n't see as the person in the room with them			1
but remember , @entity232 looking at his watch was taken as some sign that he did n't care			0
fair ? not fair ? it matters , it 's television			2
and so it 's not just what you say , but it 's how they present themselves			2
you never know when that moment is			0
you never know until it happens			0
you ca n't set up these moments			0
but the purpose of the debate is to get beyond what people have already heard , down to what one hopes the viewers and the voters are waiting to hear about			1
@entity1 : what is it like to be the first female moderator in 20 years ? @entity2 : people say , " do you think you 're going to ask a different question because you 're female ? " and i think , " i 'm going to ask different questions because of all the things that i am			1
" @entity262 and i are different , @entity263 and i are different , we come from different backgrounds , we 've had different experiences , and certainly , one of the differences between them and me is that i 'm female and they 're male , so that 's a part of it			2
and so , i guess i did n't embrace the history of it until women started coming -- and by the way , men as well -- i mean , i have just sons , and they were thrilled and said , " @entity276 , did you know you 're the first woman , you know , in 20 years ? " so they were excited by it			1
so i embraced that , kind of , after the fact			0
i first just embraced it as an amazing chance for a journalist			0
@entity1 : how did you get the news ? @entity2 : i was actually sitting at work			1
we were booking the show ( " @entity8 " ) and i was in my office and i got a phone call from the executive director of the presidential debate commission , who said , " we were wondering if you 'd be willing to moderate a debate			1
" and i said , " let me just think -- yes ! " it was a very quick phone call , actually			0
@entity1 : what was your reaction ? @entity2 : well , understand that they told me not to tell anyone , so that was in some ways the hardest part			1
i cheated -- i told my children -- but beyond that , i did n't tell anybody			0
and so it was just this weird sort of " @entity311 " thing going on , because i knew something that other people did n't know			0
but i mean inside , i was thinking , ' whoa , this is amazing			0
" i mean , for a journalist , does it get better than that ? not much better that i can think of .			0

@entity1 's @entity2 is first woman to moderate presidential debate in 20 years
" there 's something about these debates that magnifies things , " she says
@entity2 : purpose of debate is to get beyond what people have already heard
