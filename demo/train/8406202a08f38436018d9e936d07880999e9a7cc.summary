-- in some ways , the latest @entity2 engagement is a humorist 's dream			1
an elderly man , a 24 - year - old @entity6 -- what do we think each person is getting out of this alliance ? i do n't think you need a ph.d. to assess the exchange of resources that has brought them together			2
he has money , fame , a lifetime of good stories and useful networks			0
she gives him the prestige that a glamorous woman bestows upon her beau , a few virility points ( if we believe that 's part of the bargain ) and the daily flattery of having a beautiful , and we hope nice , woman fussing over him , holding his hand and making sure he gets his vitamins			1
not a bad deal for either of them actually			0
but the may - december couple also offers a bit more to chew on when we think of large age gaps between partners in general and the urge to marry versus cohabit			1
in order to think about this kind of relationship more seriously , we have to use the much - mated , just - twice - married @entity2 as a jumping off point , rather than wrestle with his particular motives -- not the least of which might be the fact that his marriages are not a bad advertisement for the @entity51 brand			1
as a sociologist who specializes in studying sexuality , love and relationships and as a consultant to @entity58 , i do not find late - in - life love or marriage ridiculous , nor do i think age gaps between partners are always a mistake			1
@entity2 brings up these issues , but he certainly should n't define them for us			1
passion does not necessarily dim over the life cycle			2
i have a widowed friend who has just turned 83 and has fallen in love again			0
she had been dating online and asking friends to introduce her to potential partners , because after two years or so of grieving for her husband of many years , she wanted the comfort and thrill of another romantic partner			2
she found a lovely man , 86 , and they have fallen in love and are enjoying life together			2
they recently returned from a trip to @entity82			0
they live in different urban communities designed for older men and women and spend a lot of time in each other 's place			2
they are a wonderful couple			0
ok , so they are " age appropriate , " but that they are in the market for romance at their age is part of the point			0
i know other successful couples with large age gaps whose marriages would strike envy in the hearts of anyone who met them			2
my friends @entity109 and @entity111 have a 25 - year - plus spread and have been married for over 15 years			2
he is in his early 80s , she in her 50s			0
they are spectacularly well - suited for one another and have an active life in the state of @entity118 and doing charitable dental work in the @entity121 bush			1
love , when it truly happens , is precious at any age			0
it is possible at any age			0
and even if it is not passionate love , even if it is just the comfort of companionship and spending time with someone you respect , it is a boon to the heart , health and happiness of both partners			1
and it can run both ways : a study released in 2003 by the @entity139 's @entity138 concluded that the proportion of women in @entity142 and @entity143 marrying younger men rose from 15 % to 26 % between 1963 and 1998			1
i hesitate to congratulate @entity2 , not because of his age ( he 's 84 ) , or even because of his partner 's age -- but rather because it is hard to know the motives of the rich and famous and the people who marry them			1
whether these motives will bring either person in the relationship the support and love that late - life marriage can bring is not known			1
one final thought : you might be saying , " but why should they marry ? if it 's love , ca n't they just live together ? they are probably not going to have children ... " i agree that living together is a good answer for many older people			0
it is less complicated financially and legally , and it does n't arouse as much fear in adult children that possible inheritances will be compromised			0
but there is nothing in our society that certifies the intent of two partners in the same way marriage does			1
only marriage presents a clear definition of how a couple wants to be seen and treated by the world , their families , their friends and community			0
only marriage brings with it a complete body of law , with traditional privileges and obligations			1
so yes , if that 's what someone wants to say to the world at 84 , the same way they would have said at 34 , why not ? they have the right as adults and citizens			0
whether they are making a wise choice of partner is another issue entirely			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			1

@entity207 : easy to joke about @entity2 's plan to wed a much younger woman
but whatever the motivations , she says , late - life marriages not ridiculous , not always a mistake
such unions can provide comfort , companionship , respect , she says
@entity207 : why not just cohabit ? marriage certifies intent to society and obligations of law
