-- more than 60 years after reneging on a promise to the hundreds of thousands of @entity4 who fought for the @entity2 during @entity6 , the @entity2 government will soon be sending out checks -- to the few who are still alive			1
veteran @entity9 says , " we are loyal to the @entity2 , except that the @entity2 has forgotten us			1
" " for a poor man like me , $ 15,000 is a lot of money , " said 91 - year - old @entity11			1
still , he said , " after what we have suffered , what we have contributed for the sake of democracy , it 's peanuts			0
it 's a drop in the bucket			0
" during the war , the @entity4 was a @entity2 commonwealth			1
the @entity2 military promised full veterans benefits to @entity4 who volunteered to fight			1
then , in 1946 , president @entity28 signed the @entity29 , taking that promise away			1
today , only about about 15,000 of those troops are still alive , according to the @entity32 for @entity4 veterans			1
a provision tucked inside the stimulus bill that president @entity36 signed calls for releasing $ 198 million that was appropriated last year for those veterans			1
those who have become @entity2 citizens get $ 15,000 each ; non-citizens get $ 9,000			1
" i 'm very thankful , " said @entity43 , 88 , the coalition 's president			2
" we @entity4 are a grateful people			1
" @entity43 was among the tens of thousands of @entity4 at the infamous battle of @entity47 , a peninsula on @entity48 opposite the @entity4 capital			1
he was captured and beaten by @entity51 troops before ultimately being freed , suffering from malaria and then resuming his service to the @entity2 military			1
" the record of the @entity4 soldiers for bravery and loyalty is second to none , " @entity28 wrote to the leaders of the @entity56 and @entity57 in 1946			1
" their assignment was as bloody and difficult as any in which our @entity2 soldiers engaged			2
under desperate circumstances they acquitted themselves nobly			0
" though @entity28 said the @entity29 resulted in " discrimination , " he signed it			1
" there can be no question but that the @entity4 veteran is entitled to benefits bearing a reasonable relation to those received by the @entity2 veteran , with whom he fought side by side , " he said			1
" from a practical point of view , however , it must be acknowledged that certain benefits granted by the gi bill of rights can not be applied in the case of the @entity4 veteran			1
" some historians say financial concerns were paramount : the cost of funding full veterans benefits to all those @entity4 , particularly in the wake of the costly war , would have been a heavy burden			1
the @entity93 for @entity94 offers a different explanation			0
" in 1946 , discrimination against people of color was the rule of law , " the group says in a document it submitted to the @entity36 - @entity99 transition team in november			0
" the second - class treatment of @entity106 veterans is another example from this historical period			0
" for decades , @entity110 activists and their supporters have fought for the full benefits			2
they 've petitioned and picketed			0
@entity113 , a widower who now lives in @entity115 with his daughter , once chained himself to the fence outside the @entity56			0
" i was fined $ 50 for civil disobedience and was arrested , " he says now , chuckling			2
he says he was just looking for answers			0
despite encouraging words from @entity2 presidents , including @entity123 and @entity124 , the benefits were never restored			1
" only 70,000 @entity4 veterans remain alive , and they hope to stay alive long enough to see those benefits reinstated , " @entity0 reported in 1997			1
" there 's a bill , stuck in committee in @entity130 , that would do just that			0
" that effort , just like so many before , fell apart			0
" we were loyal to the @entity2			2
even up to now , we are loyal to the @entity2 , except that the @entity2 has forgotten us in many ways , " said @entity9 , another leader of the @entity32 for @entity4 veterans			1
" it 's only now , because of the insistence of @entity140 [ @entity139 ] @entity138 in the @entity57 , he was able to act on this			2
" @entity138 , @entity142 , inserted the language in the stimulus bill , calling it " a matter of honor			0
" the honor comes too late for the many @entity110 veterans who passed away waiting for this moment			0
families of deceased veterans are not eligible to receive the money			0
for those who are alive , the checks could make a real difference			2
" practically all of us are below the poverty line now at this age			0
we have no way of earning a living , " @entity9 said			0
but , he emphasized , " it does not correct the injustice and discrimination done to us 60 years ago			0
... we were not granted school benefits			2
we were not granted hospital benefits			0
... and in the 60 years , several billion dollars were saved by the @entity2 government for not paying 250,000 of us			2
" now we are only 15,000			0
and the amount that they 're giving us is a small amount			0
because it will finally recognize our services ... as active service in the armed forces of the @entity2			2
" @entity0 's @entity175 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 were promised full military benefits to enlist
president @entity28 later signed act reneging on promise
only about 15,000 of the troops are still alive
