-- are you tired of @entity2 ? i am			1
i 'm tired of reading about her			1
i 'm tired of talking about her			1
i 'm tired of hearing other people talk about her			1
i 'm tired of people looking for excuses to talk about her			1
i 'm as tired of people who revel in beating her up as i am of people making excuses for her			1
to be brutally honest , i was tired of her even before she was called out in public for conduct and language detrimental to african - americans			2
yet , like spectators at an over-extended @entity25 bout , we seem perversely fixated on @entity2 's crashing , bruising struggle to stay upright while finding new ways to fall down			1
last week , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 joined the @entity32 and @entity33 ( the pharmaceutical company that makes the diabetes medication advertised by the " queen of @entity36 " ) in cutting their ties with @entity2			1
and , in what some believe to be the most grievous blow of all , @entity41 , the @entity43 subsidiary publishing her latest cookbook , " @entity2 's @entity44 , " announced friday that it was dropping that title from its fall release catalog			1
the tv and marketing deals were one thing			0
but the cookbooks ? they made up the foundation upon which @entity2 's empire was built			1
@entity54 , the media consultant who inspired the creation of " @entity56 and has been hired by @entity2 to orchestrate her recovery , has her work cut out for her -- especially if , as seems likely , we 're going to be forced against our collective will to witness what promises to be an excruciating restoration process			1
especially if that process is going to be anything resembling that much - hyped " apology " on @entity66 's " @entity65 " last week , which culminated with the single most disingenuous use of the verb " is " since @entity69 's more than a decade ago			0
having squirmed my way through that 20 - minute segment at least once , i found @entity2 to be far less contrite than others expected or inferred			1
her cast - the - first - stone plea to the audience ; her version of the " black - people - say - that - word - too " complaint about using the " n - word , " her insistence that she would n't have fired herself for what she 'd said " a world ago ... with a gun to my head			0
" watch : the n - word 's history : where did it come from ? some of the comments resonated with regret -- tearful and at times poignant			0
but it sounded more like regret that she 's being put through all this humiliation in the first place			0
this seemed to be a conversation not with @entity100 so much as with the people who were devoted to her in the first place			0
and indeed , with ongoing litigation by a former employee of @entity2 's restaurant figuring into the disclosure , no one tuning in that morning should have expected her to admit any wrongdoing on camera			2
but why did n't he ask @entity2 about her apparent delight with the notion of preparing a wedding party with a plantation motif complete with an all - black staff of servers ? an interviewer might at least have had the right to ask whether she understands that antebellum days mean different things to the collective memory of african - americans than they do to more sentimental white @entity122			2
indeed , asking @entity2 point - blank , " are you a racist ? " was in so many ways the wrong question to ask			2
( @entity100 might have been better off asking a locked basement door to open up			0
) if she 'd been asked , instead , " what do you think racism is ? " it might have bewildered , even antagonized her more			0
but it 's a question that needed to be posed at some point -- and not just to @entity2			2
for , as is frequently the case when a celebrity is caught making a bigoted or similarly inappropriate remark , the incident gets drummed up as one of those so - called " teachable moments " for an @entity142 still wrestling with the specter of race , even after it has elected ( twice ) its first black president			0
what often happens instead is another dreary star - bashing ritual , an occasion for pillorying public figures caught in an embarrassing act with censure that makes the rest of us feel superior to the offending party			1
in a media culture ruled by tabloid thinking ( if not necessarily by tabloids themselves ) , it 's an exercise in moralizing as opposed to genuine moral examination			0
would n't it be nice if , for this one time , this kind of story really did cause the rest of us to re-examine and reflect upon our unfinished business regarding race and culture ? and to ask ourselves what constitutes racism in our 21st century society ? it is true that we no longer have racially separate drinking fountains , rest rooms and train compartments			1
but it is also true that a disproportionate number of young black people receive far harsher jail sentences ( e.g. life with no possibility of parole ) than their white counterparts convicted of similar crimes			0
is that justice ? or is it a form of racism ? consider " @entity199 , " the recent documentary by @entity201 and @entity202 , about the rush to judgment by police , prosecutors and the @entity194 media against five minority youths convicted of the 1989 rape and assault of a white female jogger			0
when the verdicts were vacated in 2002 after someone already in prison confessed to the crime , it did n't get nearly the attention as , say , the verbal racial pratfalls of @entity210 , @entity211 or even @entity2			2
the documentary 's theatrical release last fall offered some opportunity for widespread soul searching about racial presumptions			0
but not much ; not , anyway , as much as there should be			0
it seems , in short , that @entity142 is now more inclined to view racism as a lapse in manners instead of a persistent , recurring presence in its soul , one of many unpleasant facts of life that we 'd rather not confront directly , unless it allows us to indulge in schadenfreude ( defined as pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others -- say , celebrities who misspeak )			0
no matter how the @entity2 mess shakes itself out , it will likely be just another squalid real - life melodrama that keeps the rest of us from acknowledging one simple truth : racism wo n't even begin to erode until people give themselves the time and space to consider who each of is as opposed to what each of us is			1
which , granted , is not as catchy as " i is what i is			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			2

@entity254 : i 'm tired of people beating up on @entity2 and also of those excusing her
he says we fixate on her disastrous *statements* , apologies , *attempts* to right herself
he says we use her to feel superior , rather than face our unfinished business with racism
@entity272 : we focus on celebrity *gaffes* , not *incarceration* rates , real forms of *discrimination*
