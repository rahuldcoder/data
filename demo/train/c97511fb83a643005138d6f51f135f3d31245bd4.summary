-- the @entity2 kidnapping drama was unfolding on the airwaves , hour after hour , a riveting spectacle that was overshadowing every other conceivable story			1
nothing could possibly bump it from the nation 's television screens -- or so i thought			2
when word came wednesday afternoon that a verdict had been reached in the @entity16 murder trial , the focus of the cable news universe immediately shifted from @entity17 to @entity18 , where the defendant was convicted of first - degree murder			1
it was a day of anguish and emotion -- and a revealing rorschach test of media values			0
in an age of school shootings and marathon bombings , hard - bitten journalists have grown accustomed to reporting on human depravity			1
but there is something about what happened in @entity2 that tears at the heart			1
yes , the story went wall to wall , overshadowing virtually everything else , except for the @entity40 coverage of the congressional hearing on the attack in @entity43			1
but the crimes in @entity2 deserve to be big news precisely because they border on the unimaginable			1
three teenage girls vanish in separate incidents , only to be freed nearly a decade later from some modern - day house of horrors ? ropes and chains , according to city officials , are found in the home ? @entity54 , who made that anguished 911 call , has a baby ? if you do n't think that 's a story , you are lacking a heart			2
the @entity64 trial , in my view , is very different			0
it became a national soap opera because many media organizations were drawn to the graphic sexual testimony -- in voice mails , texts and so on -- that could be trumpeted for ratings and clicks			0
it was hardly big news when the unknown @entity64 killed her ex-boyfriend @entity16 in 2008 -- such murders are sadly common			1
the level of savagery -- 27 stab wounds , a slit throat , a gunshot to the head -- may have been unusual , but it was the trial 's explicit sexual evidence that provided the hook			0
@entity64 was soon slotted into the @entity88 / @entity87 category of attractive white women in trouble			2
the @entity2 saga , by contrast , conjures up every parent 's worst nightmare : three teenage girls disappearing for years , their fate unknown and , we now know , according to police , raped in captivity			1
@entity101 's @entity100 scored an interview with the son of suspect @entity54 , plus exclusive photos of @entity54 in the frame house where women were held			2
since the @entity111 tabloids are known for paying for information , how did the @entity100 obtain from @entity113 what hordes of @entity109 journalists could not ? " we did not pay him either for the interview or for the photos , " @entity100 reporter @entity114 told me			0
" he spoke with us because he wanted to have his story represented			2
" @entity113 told the @entity100 in the interview that his father padlocked the doors leading to the basement , attic and garage where @entity54 and two other women were allegedly kept , never allowing his family inside			2
" if it 's true that he took her captive and forced her into having sex with him and having his child and keeping her hidden and keeping them from sunlight , he really took those girls ' lives , " @entity113 was quoted as saying , adding : " he deserves to be behind bars for the rest of her life			0
" the fast - moving @entity2 story does have its media circus aspects			1
on wednesday the cable news channels , taking their cue from police , were bannering an expected public statement by @entity149			1
but it was her sister , @entity151 , who spoke briefly to the assembled media mob , making a plea for the family 's privacy			0
and it was a little much when @entity149 's grandmother allowed a local station to videotape her first call from @entity54 -- a moment that feels like it should have remained private			0
in a more uplifting vein , @entity54 , a local dishwasher who heard screams from the house and broke down the door , has been making the television rounds			0
many people are " saying you 're a hero , " @entity0 's @entity170 told him			0
" no , no , no , " @entity54 replied			0
" @entity173 , i 'm a @entity174 , an @entity109 , and just like you			0
we bleed same blood , put our pants on the same way			0
" many questions remain , to say the least , about how the kidnapping succeeded for so many years and whether the police fell short			0
but whatever media excesses unfold in the coming days , the story of the @entity2 women commands our attention as a matter of human compassion			1
the sooner that @entity16 fades from the headlines , the better			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			1

@entity191 : story of kidnapped women in @entity2 is a riveting one
he says news *outlets* switched attention to @entity16 verdict wednesday afternoon
@entity191 says murder cases are sadly common ; @entity2 case of a different *magnitude*
@entity191 : story " commands our attention as a matter of human compassion "
