-- @entity1 took a crucial step towards winning the @entity4 title after coming from behind to beat @entity5 , move top of the table and pile the pressure on to their championship rivals			1
an early @entity12 wonder goal had given @entity5 the lead at @entity14 before @entity15 leveled			2
@entity17 international @entity16 scored twice alowing @entity1 to take control of the match before @entity21 's goal ensured a tense end to the second half			1
after @entity25 's capitulation against @entity26 last week , @entity1 knew they had to win to keep the destination of the title in their own hands			2
both @entity26 and @entity25 had hoped that @entity5 could do them a favor by taking points from @entity1 , and the signs were good when @entity12 's early strike gave the home side a first half lead			1
but @entity1 came back strongly and , despite a late @entity5 rally , held on to victory			1
at the full time whistle the @entity1 players collapsed on the pitch , perhaps knowing that the toughest test of their title race was behind them			0
with two games to go just two points separate @entity1 , @entity26 and @entity25			0
but @entity1 's vastly superior goal difference means that if they win their last two games they will secure the @entity4 title			1
" that 's what we wanted ultimately , " @entity1 captain @entity47 said after the game			0
" if we hopefully play like we can we have goals from all over the pitch so that will make the difference			0
" earlier in the day , @entity55 and @entity56 tasted the pain and ignominy of @entity4 relegation after both teams lost crucial matches			1
meanwhile @entity62 , who spent most of the season rooted to the bottom of the table , all but secured survival by improbably defeating @entity68 at @entity69			1
it was an afternoon of high drama across @entity72 as promotion and relegation places were being decided in all four professional divisions in warm spring sunshine			0
but the highest stakes were at play in the @entity4			2
this was @entity55 's first ever season in the @entity4 , a season that has been defined by defeat , fan unrest and boardroom chaos			1
former coach @entity84 was controversially fired mid-way through the season by the club 's billionaire @entity87 owner @entity86 , much to the fans ' unhappiness			0
@entity84 's replacement , former @entity68 striker @entity93 , could not spark a renaissance as his team fell into the relegation zone for the majority of the rest of the season			0
@entity55 traveled to @entity100 , another club engulfed by boardroom and personnel chaos , needing victory			0
instead @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 all scored to secure a 3 - 0 victory for @entity100 and see @entity55 limp back into the championship , @entity72 football 's second tier			1
@entity56 , owned by @entity112 billionaire @entity111 , headed the same direction after a 4 - 1 capitulation against @entity115			1
despite a late season revival led by new coach @entity117 -- @entity56 's third of the season -- there was little fight from the @entity123 team as @entity115 pushed @entity56 towards relegation			0
yet both teams were condemned by an unlikely result at @entity69			0
@entity62 , like @entity56 and @entity55 , had changed managerial personnel mid-season as @entity128 was removed and replaced by former @entity130 international @entity129			1
a late season @entity62 revival led by young striker @entity132 -- once tipped at as a future @entity72 international who had instead been farmed out on loan -- had raised the unlikely prospect of survival			0
and a goal midway through the first half by @entity142 international @entity141 was enough to secure a stunning victory for the @entity62			0
the only team that can now catch @entity62 is @entity145 , who play league title chasing @entity26 sunday			2
defeat would all but ensure @entity62 's @entity4 safety .			2

@entity16 scores twice as @entity1 beat @entity5 3 - 2
city go top of @entity4 with two to play
@entity55 and @entity56 relegated
@entity62 beat @entity68 at @entity69 1 - 0
