@entity0 , @entity1 -- a 30 - minute drive from the heart of the @entity1 capital along dusty pot - holed roads lie the slums of the city			1
in the distance are plains with some patches of greenery before they hit a mountain range that juts out of the earth			2
we 're in @entity0 , also known as the slum of @entity17			2
dirty brown canvas tents litter the landscape , as children walk barefoot next to open sewers			1
a group of women , wearing blue burqas , carry their young children into one particular tent			1
on the outside is a @entity29 logo next to a sign for @entity31 -- the two humanitarian organizations that fund this medical clinic , which is a last resort for some very desperate mothers			1
we follow the @entity1 women inside and are slammed by the heat and noise inside this low ceiling canvas tent			1
dozens of women sit on the floor nursing their children			1
they 've lifted up their burqas to let in some air but when they see the camera they drop the blue veils over their faces			2
some children cry , others appear too weak and exhausted to even let out a whimper			1
some of the babies have black eyeliner drawn around their eyes			2
i 'm told it 's to keep away the " evil eye " and bad spirits			2
a nurse calls out a name and 30 - year old @entity61 stands , picking up her daughter @entity62 -- the youngest of her five children			1
@entity62 is 15 months old but very small for her age			2
doctors tell me she has a condition called stunting -- acute malnutrition that affects the growth of a child			1
they follow the nurse under one of the curtains off the main waiting area where @entity62 's measurements are taken			2
staff members put a tape measure around her arm , place her on scales and make her lie down on the table to accurately measure her height			2
@entity62 starts crying , calling out for her mother			2
as @entity61 tries to comfort her little girl , she tells me : " my child was born very weak			2
all my children were born weak and underweight			1
i went to a clinic close to my home but they told me to come here			2
i 've been coming here twice a month for three months and @entity62 is now getting much better			2
she 's putting on weight and getting stronger			2
" once @entity62 's measurements are taken , @entity61 takes her little hand and leads her to a man behind a desk at the end of the tent			1
he 's handing out food supplements -- energy dense nutrients -- and putting them in plastic bags			2
he tells @entity61 how much to give @entity62 and how often to feed her			1
a lot of these mothers do n't know how to nourish their children properly			1
a lot of them have little choice because they are so poor			0
@entity61 explains to me : " our life situation is not good			0
we are suffering a bad time			0
my husband has a job , but his salary is not enough for our monthly expenses			0
i have five children , so his salary is not enough for us			1
" @entity29 estimates more than three million children in @entity1 under the age of five suffer from stunting and one - third of those cases are acute			1
these are some of the highest levels in the world			0
the technical definition for the condition is low height for age , and the causes are numerous			0
it 's the result of poor nutrition , lack of access to health care , poverty , a mother 's malnourishment , natural disasters and war			1
@entity1 has been torn by war of one kind or another for more than three decades , which only exacerbates this life - threatening problem			1
dr. @entity142 , chief of health and nutrition for @entity29 , visits the clinics in @entity1 several times a year from his base in @entity146			1
he says these outreach programs can sometimes be the difference between life and death			0
" these clinics are so important because when you have high levels of acute malnutrition that does n't just have an immediate impact on a child 's mobility and chance of sickness ... the chances of mortality and dying are much higher			1
" he says inappropriate feeding practices are often at the core of the problem			0
poor and uneducated @entity1 women have received misinformation that breastfeeding is bad and not good for your child			1
and those that do breastfeed will dilute it with water or tea			0
it 's a huge problem facing health groups working in @entity1 , as they desperately try to re-educate mothers on the importance of breastfeeding			1
@entity29 nutritionist @entity180 weighs into the conversation explaining that somewhere in the last 20 years the message has been mixed up			1
" i spoke to a doctor in @entity1 who said his grandmother used to feed all the poor babies in her village with her breast milk			1
now these women are told to use instant formula or mix it with water and crushed biscuits			0
it 's such a dangerous message			0
breast milk is the golden drop for the child and the best chance of giving these kids the start they will need in what will be a tough life			1
" a nurse calls out a new name -- this time an 18 - year - old woman called @entity206 picks up her two listless children off the floor			1
she 's traveled more than two hours to get here			0
in her arms are seven - month - old boy @entity210 and her three - year old daughter @entity211			0
they look roughly the same size			0
@entity214 has sores all over her face and patches of skin missing from her legs			0
she wears a dirty pink outfit and no shoes			0
she clings to her mother and whimpers			0
" my child was very weak and under weight when she was born , " says @entity206 , a mother of four			0
" we did n't have money , so someone told me about this clinic , and i brought her here to hopefully get some medicine			1
" doctors examine @entity231 and tell her mother she has a very severe case of malnutrition and must go to hospital			0
confused by what doctors are saying , her husband @entity235 arrives and takes charge			0
he 's 38 years old but looks at least 10 years older with his dry , weathered skin			0
he sells corn on the street to support his family and asks : " who is going to pay for us to go to the doctors ? who is going to pay for her treatment ? " the nurse gives @entity249 a sachet of the energy dense food that comes in the form of peanut paste			0
she slowly opens her mouth and sucks it			0
her father smiles and continues to feed her , forcing it into her mouth			1
the nurse explains that she needs time to digest and break it up with mouthfuls of water			0
as life returns to @entity211 's little brown eyes her young mother relaxes a little			0
she knows her child is out of danger for now but explains the reality of their lives and the hardship they face everyday			0
" we do n't have enough food , and sometimes our four children have nothing to eat			1
we live in a tent ; we have few belongings			2
if my husband gets work , then we can find food			0
if not , then we all eat less			0
this can go on for days			0

at a @entity29 aid tent in @entity1 families line up with sick , malnourished children
@entity29 estimates more than 3 million @entity1 children under 5 suffer from stunting
many families do n't know how to nourish their children properly
and poverty means many ca n't feed their kids properly
