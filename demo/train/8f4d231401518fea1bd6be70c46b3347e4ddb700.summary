-- two @entity2 have been fought , empires lost , the atom split , the worldwide web invented and social media proliferated , but all the while a unique set of quintessential @entity8 sporting events have remained in their own self - regulated time warp , with only minor concessions to modernity			1
@entity12 and @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 at the @entity18 at @entity19 are an integral part of the " @entity21 " where royal patronage and tradition are the key ingredients and woe betide any attempt to change them			1
" these events are set in aspic , " leading social commentator @entity30 told @entity0			2
so that means a strict dress code , certainly if you want to be allowed into the @entity34 at @entity13 or its equivalent at @entity12 , which starts on tuesday			1
top hat and tails at the former , @entity36 at the latter			0
jeans or shorts ? do n't bother to try , you will be ever so politely turned away			0
dress code for ladies , hats should be worn and dresses and skirts " should be of a modest length defined as falling just above the knee or longer , " according to the official @entity13 website			2
it 's no different at @entity14 , but entry to the @entity54 ' enclosure is restricted to members only and invites to the @entity56 at @entity15 to watch @entity57 strut his stuff are limited to the great and the good			1
with all those barriers to overcome just to be seen in the right place , it 's even more surprising that in @entity66 's opinion the majority of the people at these iconic sporting events , could not care a jot about the sport itself			1
" that 's the thing about the @entity8 social season , it 's just a pretext to have a good time , a lot of people spending a lot of time not watching but eating and drinking and having a generally good time , " he said			1
so while top jockeys wrestle with the cream of thoroughbred racehorses , @entity84 and world rowing champions strain every sinew down the @entity87 at @entity14 and @entity88 plays a sublime cross court winner at @entity15 , the cry will come up " more @entity90 please			1
" according to official figures , 45,000 pints of @entity90 -- a quintessential @entity92 summer drink -- were consumed at @entity13 alone , not to mention 51,000 bottles of champagne			1
@entity97 events @entity66 , renowned for his wry and sometimes acerbic observations of the upper classes , could be accused of exaggeration , but he is only repeating a famous observation of former monarch @entity104 , who described horse racing at @entity12 as " a garden party with some racing tacked on ! " @entity108 was renowned for his flamboyant lifestyle , but like his great grand daughter , @entity110 , he had a genuine interest and love of racing and horses , so perhaps he did bother to watch , particularly as he owned some of the contenders			1
for others said @entity66 , " it 's the chance to wear splendid clothes and do some social climbing			0
" having the right connections as well as sticking to the rules , the other key requirement is a stoicism and stiff upper lip in the face of the inclement and unpredictable @entity8 weather			1
so beware washouts at @entity15 ( unless you are at @entity132 where there is a roof ) , high heels stuck in the mud on the @entity136 at the @entity18 , boaters blown off in the wind at @entity14 , or choppy waters for the spectator flotilla at @entity141			1
for the dedicated " sports fans " who battle the elements , it 's all worth it to rub shoulders with the right type of person and soak up the very englishness of it all -- not to mention have a very good lunch			0
glorious @entity12 the sporting part of the " season " comes to an end with @entity12 and @entity141 , but with @entity92 's rare heatwave proving an exception to the rule , attendances are booming			1
120,000 people plus are expected at @entity12 this week and @entity66 believes the festival 's success is deserved because of the work of lord march , the heir apparent to the @entity165 , who owns the race course and the vast estate			2
" it is especially interesting , it is n't just a race course , it belongs to a real live person with a real live family influence , " added @entity30			0
" there 's just so much to do , it 's a wonderful place and you will never be bored , it 's loved by the discriminating			0
" march , who took the reins from his father in 1994 has diversified to run the @entity183 and a vintage car revival event , both incredibly popular			0
while not by strict definition part of the " @entity21 , " as defined by @entity187 , the events have become an unofficial part of the social season and a must for those hoping to catch the eye for any number of reasons			1
debutantes delight by repute , the " @entity21 " was apparently designed to allow members of @entity199 and the @entity200 , the ruling class , the chance to amuse themselves while stuck in @entity202 rather than on their country estates			0
but its real purpose became to introduce their daughters , debutantes , into the social scene after being officially presented to the reigning monarch at a special ceremony at @entity210			0
@entity110 ended the tradition , curtseys and all , in 1958 , fearing it had become outdated in a period of rapid social change			2
but young women , still encouraged by their parents to meet an appropriate member of the opposite sex and preferably of the same class , continued to flock to @entity13 and the others events in their droves			1
and a new breed of " debuntante " emerged , the " @entity225 , " young women who mainly frequented the exclusive south west area of @entity202 around @entity228 and @entity229			0
they were epitomized by @entity231 , who was to marry prince @entity232 in 1981 and become an iconic global figure			0
@entity66 and his co-author @entity234 captured the mood of the times perfectly in their 1982 best seller " the @entity240 " which sold over a million copies and acquired cult status			0
@entity225 by repute , " @entity225 " loved equestrian events , so @entity245 , the @entity246 , @entity13 and @entity12 , all part of the @entity21 , were very much in vogue			1
ironically , despite sporting the traditional tweed and green welly look , princess @entity231 did not enjoy country pursuits of her followers , but did attend @entity15 to present the trophy at the 1995 men 's singles championship , won by @entity255			2
her tragic death in 1997 left a nation in morning , but the " @entity225 " style and their male equivalents , cruelly named " @entity261 " persisted			0
@entity66 updated the earlier offering with " @entity263 , more expensive " in 2007 , co-written with @entity264 , and current @entity92 prime minister @entity265 was in his sights			0
" he 's the classic male @entity225 , " @entity30 said			0
not surprising then to see @entity265 frequenting the @entity56 at @entity15 to cheer on @entity57 to victory this year , although to be fair his arch political rivals @entity268 leader @entity269 and @entity270 , the leader of the @entity272 opposition in the @entity92 parliament , were also watching			2
global super-rich with the global super rich now buying up large chunks of @entity202 property , " @entity280 is a branch of @entity281 or @entity282 , @entity279 is for the @entity286 , " observed @entity66 , the clientele at some of @entity8 's sporting jewels in the crown has also changed			2
overseas visitors are also a growing feature			0
" these events are steeped and tradition and history and can not be replicated anywhere in the world , " said @entity289 , head of @entity290 at @entity291			0
" to experience one of these events , is to experience a true insight into @entity8 culture , pomp and ceremony and all , " she added			2
as @entity289 says , impossible to recreate , with heritage dating back to the 19th century , one suspects that even in 100 years time the essential elements that make up the @entity8 's sporting summer will remain largely untouched and perhaps the better for it .			1
