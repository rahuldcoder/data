@entity0 , @entity1 -- anytime anyone learns that i 'm a sports columnist , one of two questions is sure to follow			1
it 's either " what 's it like to be a female sports writer ? " or " do you go in the locker room ? " the first one is tricky to answer			1
the second one is not : " yes , and it stinks			2
" locker rooms are smelly places			1
they are really not fun places to be inside			2
but you know what ? that 's where the athletes and coaches who i need to interview are , and so , that 's where i am going to be			1
the locker room has been the designated spot for postpractice and postgame interviews for at least a century			1
going into one is never glamorous or fun , but it has to be done			2
my job has taken me inside pro sports locker rooms off and on for the past dozen years or so			1
while the arrival of the @entity40 in @entity0 several years has increased the frequency with which i 'm inside locker rooms , i still remember the first time that i went into a pro sports locker room			1
my employer , @entity46 , sent me to @entity47 , @entity48 , to cover a @entity50 game			2
with @entity0 being only three hours away from the @entity54 - @entity53 area , we have lots of readers who are @entity50 fans			0
they were in playoff contention , and they were hosting a weekend series with the @entity61			0
i had lots of stories to write and interviews to do , so i had to get there early for the open locker - room period before the game			1
as i took the elevator down from the press box to the field level , my mind was racing about all the players i needed to interview			0
but it was also spinning because i was n't sure what to expect in the locker room			1
it was n't the first time i 'd been in a locker room to do interviews , but it was the first time i 'd been inside a pro locker room			1
would it be any different ? would it be hostile ? would it be weird ? would it be like " @entity85 " except with millionaire athletes ? when the clubhouse attendant opened the doors signaling the start of the media availability , empty bottles of @entity88 did not spill into the hallway			2
there were no signs of diamond - encrusted togas either			0
instead , there were just a bunch of baseball players getting ready to play a game			0
some ended up being knuckleheads			0
they refused to talk , or they hung out in the training room so they did n't have to talk			0
i remember going to the @entity61 locker room to try to get a minute with @entity107			2
this was during the height of his popularity , so i figured there was no way i 'd get any one - on - one time			0
@entity107 actually offered me the chair at his locker			2
i told him that it was n't necessary , that i did n't mind standing or kneeling , but he would n't hear it			0
he sat on the ledge of his locker , i sat on the chair , and he talked to me for a good five minutes			2
whether a player was good to interview had nothing to do with my gender			2
i believe they treated me the same way they would 've treated a male reporter who was in my shoes			0
that 's continued to be my experience in pro locker rooms			1
i 've never felt threatened			0
i 've never been harassed			0
frankly , i suspect that 's the experience of most female reporters who 've been in pro locker rooms			1
most of us have never found ourselves in a situation like the recent one involving members of the @entity141			0
[ the owner of the @entity141 apologized to a @entity144 reporter following allegations that @entity141 personnel harassed her at practice this weekend , and she accepted			0
] for that , we are grateful			0
for that , i am grateful			0
we have our foremothers to thank for much of the progress that has been made in the past three decades , women such as @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157			1
when the @entity161 was founded in 1987 , the treatment of female reporters in locker rooms was a huge problem -- if they were even granted locker - room access			1
@entity155 , then a @entity165 reporter , was prohibited from entering the locker room at the @entity167 by @entity169 commissioner @entity168 , which prompted a lawsuit that led a @entity173 federal judge to rule that reporters deserve equal locker - room access regardless of gender			1
@entity157 battled for equal access from the @entity178 in 1979 , then was harassed later that season by male reporters when the @entity181 banned all reporters from the locker room because of her			1
and while doing interviews in the @entity186 ' locker room in 1980 , @entity154 was surrounded by several players , who made aggressive , vulgar comments			1
the players were fined , the team 's general manager was fired for trying to cover up the incident , and the resulting firestorm led to death threats			0
those women were simply trying to do their jobs			2
they fought for that right to a fair and equal work environment , and it 's a fight that we must continue to fight			0
we have come so far , yet we still have so far to go			0
women in sports media today may not face such extreme circumstances , but the harassment continues			1
sometimes those words or actions may not even be directed to a specific female reporter , but they still create a hostile work environment			0
one day , i hope all female sports reporters will no longer have to face that environment when they enter the locker room			1
i hope they can focus on the job that they 're there to do			2
i hope the worse thing that they have to worry about is how much the place smells			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			1

*pioneering* women broke the gender *barrier* in sports coverage , says @entity225
she says interviewing athletes in locker rooms is vital to the job
much progress has been made but some reporters still face harassment , she says
