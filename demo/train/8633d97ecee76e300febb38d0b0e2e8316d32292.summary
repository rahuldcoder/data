@entity0 , @entity1 -- hundreds of thousands of people packed a main square in the @entity1 capital sunday to witness a rare and ambitious concert that , despite its nonpolitical theme , drew criticism from some @entity1 exiles in the @entity10			1
@entity12 singer @entity11 , creator of the " peace without @entity15 " concert , performs at sunday 's event in @entity0			1
@entity12 singer @entity11 -- a 17 - time @entity17 winner -- brought 15 international artists to @entity0 for sunday 's " peace without @entity15 " concert			1
all of the artists wore white as a symbol of peace			0
" i ca n't believe what my eyes are seeing , " @entity11 said on stage , describing the sea of people as a " beautiful dream			2
" sunday 's event was @entity11 ' attempt to connect isolated @entity1 with the rest of the region , including the @entity10			1
the decades - old @entity10 embargo on @entity1 is the most visible manifestation of the communist country 's political isolation			1
the crowd cheered when @entity11 said , " we are all brothers , and we all have to be connected			0
" but the reaction in @entity41 , @entity42 , home to both @entity11 and a large @entity1 exile community , has not been entirely peaceful			1
@entity11 has received death threats over the concert via @entity46 , he said , and his home in @entity41 is under police protection			1
some @entity1 exiles in @entity42 have called the concert a declaration of war , smashing his records in a public anti-juanes demonstration			1
@entity11 sang with @entity1 performers barred from visiting the @entity10 , like @entity55			1
but missing from this concert were @entity1 - @entity10 performers like @entity58 and @entity59 , fierce critics of the @entity1 government			1
" we asked the government and we asked @entity59 and we asked @entity58 and we tried , " @entity11 said			0
" but at this time it 's not going to happen			0
it 's not in our hands			0
" @entity59 said @entity11 ' project will only benefit the @entity68 authorities			0
" the revolution is going to win , " @entity59 said , referring to the government established by @entity70 more than 50 years ago			0
" an old system that 's dying already , you know , they 're going to give it oxygen			0
" still , @entity59 said , he respects @entity11 ' motives			0
" i think @entity11 ' idea is brilliant and it 's full of love			2
nobody is against an artist going to a country and bringing his or her work to the people , " he said			0
concert officials said more than 1.1 million people attended sunday 's event , though some other estimates were lower			2
what seemed certain was that this was the largest staged event at @entity93 since @entity94 said @entity95 here in front of an estimated 850,000 people in 1998			1
the concert was the second " peace without @entity15 " show			2
a previous concert in @entity12 aimed to ease tensions between that country and neighboring @entity105			2
@entity11 said the reaction to sunday 's concert neither surprised nor deterred him			1
" i mean , we knew that this was going to happen , " he said in a statement on his web site			0
" i have been living in @entity41 for seven years , and the first time i visited @entity41 was 10 or more years ago , so i know what happened in @entity41 with the @entity1 issue and with all these things before [ we decided ] to go to @entity1 to do this event			2
" i deeply regret having caused , let 's say , this bad moment , " he said			0
he said he had spoken to @entity1 exile leaders in @entity41 to explain his motives			0
both countries helped him overcome obstacles typical to big , free events staged by foreigners in @entity1 -- a lack of visas and expensive sound and stage equipment			2
he told the official @entity1 youth newspaper @entity129 that he would like to stage the same concert with the same artists in @entity41			2
thirty - six @entity1 dissidents gave their blessing , signing a petition in favor of the concert			1
" we think @entity11 ' initiative is good because it can help bring about national reconciliation and unity among @entity1 , " @entity70 opponent @entity137 said			1
