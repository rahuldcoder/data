@entity0 -- growing up , @entity2 was mystified by people 's reaction to music			1
he would poke fun at those around him who abandoned their composure to sing their favorite song or twirl around a dance floor			2
when someone wept at the tune of a ballad , he was bewildered			0
to him , music sounded " like trash			2
" until this summer , @entity2 , a 23 - year - old filmmaker , was able to hear only a distorted version of music in the form of bass and mid-tones through his old hearing aids			1
when he was just 9 months old , his parents learned that he was born " profoundly deaf , " and he was immediately fitted with his first listening device			1
it helped , but he was unable to hear anything clearly			0
it was nearly midnight july 6 when he was able to hear his first song in its entirety : @entity31 's " @entity30			1
" fitted with a new pair of hearing aids for the first time in years , @entity2 was sitting in a car with his close friends and remembers the moment vividly : " i was blown away by the beauty of it			1
at one point of the song , it sounded like angels singing , and i suddenly realized that this was the first time i was able to appreciate music			1
tears rolled down my face , and i tried to hide it			0
but when i looked over , i saw that there was n't a dry eye in the car			0
" @entity2 just acquired the newest technology in hearing aids because his health coverage under his parents ' insurance plan was about to expire			1
he had been skeptical and reluctant to update his devices , but his parents urged him to investigate any improvements in the technology			2
" i decided to give it a shot because a lot can happen in four years			0
it was one of the best decisions of my life , " @entity2 said			1
" i can hear much higher tones than before			0
it is also much louder and clearer			0
i actually have to keep my hearing aids at about 70 % power - volume most of the time			1
" now @entity2 is blogging about his experience on his film website , @entity72 , and on the social news site @entity73 in a post entitled " i can hear music for the first time ever , what should i listen to ? " more than 14,000 responses came , with people sharing their favorite songs and recommending all kinds of melodies for @entity2 to experience for the first time			1
some readers posted links to @entity86 videos of their favorite tunes			0
others provided long lists of tracks and artists			0
and some just left messages letting him know they were touched or inspired by his story			0
" i am blown away by all the feedback , " @entity2 said			1
" i 'm currently organizing the most popular comments and suggestions and will be posting them soon			0
" among them : " @entity99 " by @entity101 , " @entity102 " by @entity103 and " @entity104 " by @entity105 , some of his current top songs			0

" @entity2 , who studied creative writing and film at @entity118 , is a lifelong movie buff who even learned how to lip - read by matching up actors ' lips with the subtitles			1
being able to add music to his arsenal as a filmmaker is the most exciting part of the discovery , he said			1
he even started working with a composer on a short he shot several months ago			0
" it 's ironic , because when i shot this short , i never in a million years thought i would be able to work on the soundtrack			2
now , a few months later , i 'm sitting next to my friends , layering different tracks , " @entity2 said			2
now , when he sees someone singing along or dancing to the rhythm of a beat , he smiles in sympathy			0
" i understand how it could have such an impact on the listener , " he said			0
but on his personal blog , he pointed out that he still enjoys the absence of sound			2

" i listen to color : device turns colors into audio			0
