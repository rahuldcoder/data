unfortunately , he missed the deadline to sign up , so he has to wait four more years			1
and when a federal judge agreed monday to reopen the application window for one day to allow @entity2 , and only @entity2 , to apply , he said no , no special treatment			1
on september 15 @entity2 met president @entity14 and received the @entity4 in a ceremony at the @entity16			1
caught up in the bevy of activities surrounding the @entity4 ceremony , @entity2 missed the deadline to apply to the @entity9 , according to his attorney @entity21			1
" the @entity22 would love to have him			0
who would n't , whatever the organization ? " said @entity23 , a spokesman for the @entity9			0
" he 's truly an example of what the military is all about , the best of what @entity30 has to offer			0
" according to @entity23 , the city generally offers the opportunity for members of the public to apply to become a @entity0 firefighter only every four years			2
step one in the process is to sign up to take an entrance exam			0
this year , the window for potential candidates to sign up was july 15 through september 19 , @entity23 said			2
monday , @entity21 and the city filed a motion to allow them to reopen the official application period to allow @entity2 to apply			1
the city sought to reopen the applications to all would - be candidates , but @entity30 district court judge @entity49 ruled that other applicants had plenty of time to sign up for the firefighter test , and the one - day window for a late application would only be open to @entity2 , " in view of sergeant @entity2 's recognized and truly exceptional military service , " court documents said			1

if @entity77 took the path of least resistance in @entity80 the way the city did on this issue , he would not be a @entity4 recipient and there would be 36 more dead soldiers , " he said			0
@entity49 cited special recruitment efforts by the city intended to encourage members of black and @entity89 communities to apply to the @entity9			1
" a brief , general re-opening of the application period , especially without any accompanying recruitment effort beyond the @entity95 's proposed updates of the @entity9 's and @entity97 's websites , would create a serious risk of an adverse impact on the minority groups who are substantially under - represented in the ranks of the @entity9 , " @entity49 wrote in his decision			0
@entity2 said he takes responsibility for missing the application deadline , and if no one else can apply during the reopened window , he wo n't apply either			1
" unless the filing period is open to everyone , i can not morally accept it , " said @entity2 in a news release			1

i am very disappointed that i missed the deadline by only 12 hours , but i accept full responsibility for that			1
