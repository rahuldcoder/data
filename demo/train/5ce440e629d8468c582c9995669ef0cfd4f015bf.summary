@entity0 for vice president ? before we go @entity3 - z with pros and cons , let 's start with why @entity8 's team might have floated the @entity0 trial balloon now			1
if you were anywhere near a television this week you saw @entity8 getting booed at the @entity14 convention for saying he would repeal @entity15			0
it was running on a virtual loop all over cable news			2
@entity8 draws boos from @entity14 , support from conservatives then , suddenly , an exclusive report about a black woman being considered as @entity8 's running mate pops up on the @entity24			1
report sparks speculation of @entity28 ticket @entity30 sources say @entity31 is the go - to guy for a top @entity8 aide when he wants to change a narrative about his candidate			1
now that we 've gotten the " why now " out of the way , why not explore @entity28 the running mate			1
by most republicans ' accounts , at the end of this report , you will see why @entity28 will likely not be @entity8 's pick the pros there are many , beginning with the obvious : she is a black @entity30 woman , a political two - fer			1
and having a female on the ticket would make the influential @entity49 happy			0
mrs. @entity49 told @entity50 earlier this month that they have been " looking at that and i love that option			0
" @entity28 has never run for office but she is no stranger to presidential politics			2
she was by @entity56 's side during both of his campaigns			2
she 's an intellectual known for her powerhouse smarts and she has a good personal story			2
@entity28 was the only child of a black family growing up in the segregated @entity63 , whose fortitude landed her in unlikely @entity30 foreign policy circles			2
@entity28 is also a bit of a @entity68 woman			1
she is a concert pianist with a love of football			0
her real dream job is to be @entity74 commissioner			0
the former secretary of state and national security adviser would bring some needed foreign policy chops to @entity8 's ticket			0
the cons she was a central @entity56 administration player making the public case for the @entity83 war , warning about @entity85 's weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist			0
" there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons			0
but we do n't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud , " @entity28 told @entity92 's @entity91 in september 2002			1
some @entity30 sources tell @entity92 say they ca n't imagine @entity8 would want to reopen wounds from the @entity56 years -- especially about what even republicans call a mismanaged war			0
@entity28 is also at odds with the @entity30 base on immigration , telling @entity92 's @entity103 not passing her boss 's legislation allowing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants was one of her biggest regrets			1
last but hardly least is @entity28 's stance on abortion			1
she calls herself " mildly pro-choice			0
" this is the reason you can sum up social conservative reaction to the @entity28 trial balloon with one word : nonstarter			1
veteran conservative voice @entity120 , one of the founders of the @entity123 , said the notion of @entity8 picking @entity28 as his running mate would be a " slap in the face " to conservatives			1
while @entity120 took issue with @entity28 's position on abortion , he said she was part of those to blame for @entity30 losses in 2006 and 2008 which gave rise to the " @entity138 rebellion of 2010			1
" " putting @entity0 at the top of the @entity141 short list is an insult to the conservatives , tea partiers and independents that are looking for a break with the old establishment @entity30 @entity149 that @entity28 represents , " he said			1
@entity150 of the @entity151 , a longtime friend of @entity8 's , bluntly told @entity92 that @entity28 's stance on abortion disqualifies her			1
" i love @entity0 , i 'd love to see her in any role in @entity8 administration except vice president , " @entity150 told @entity92 in a telephone interview			2
the issue , he said , is n't so much @entity28 -- it 's @entity8			1
conservatives already mistrust @entity8 on abortion , since he was in favor of abortion rights when he was governor of @entity164 , a relatively liberal state on the issue			1
" it would give oxygen again to all of those concerns and doubts about whether the @entity8 administration will be there when it really counts			0
is it [ his abortion stance ] a preference and a conviction ? " @entity150 asked			0
he said putting @entity28 on the ticket would suppress conservative turnout			2
rice speculation stokes conservative reaction " what it would do is turn some activists and contributors into mere voters and turn some voters into fishermen , " he said			0
@entity187 of the @entity188 agreed			0
" i think the governor needs someone that undergirds his stated pro-life position because of policy positions that he 's taken when he was governor			0
he has since changed those positions to be clearly pro-life but to underscore that and to reemphasize that especially with social conservative voters , he has to have a running mate that has impeccable , impeccable pro-life credentials , " @entity187 said			1
the @entity202 , a leading anti-abortion group , already e-mailed around a clip of @entity8 during the @entity30 primary race last year saying that the running mate he would consider would be anti-abortion			1
" i would expect that they would all be pro-life and pro-traditional marriage , " @entity8 said in september 2011			0
@entity8 was more explicit on the campaign trail in february			0
" my vice presidential nominee will be pro-life , " @entity8 said at a rally in @entity211 , @entity212			0
despite widespread suspicion about the late - night @entity28 - for - @entity141 leak , @entity30 sources tell @entity92 some of @entity8 advisers are pushing for her -- so much so that a prominent evangelical leader told @entity92 he called the campaign last week to ask about it -- and warned that picking @entity28 would be a big mistake			1
@entity0 's view the @entity56 albatross and her position on abortion aside , there is one big reason @entity28 the running mate is unlikely to happen : she does n't want the job			1
@entity28 has said this in more of an airtight way than other contenders being buzzed about			2
" i can not imagine myself running for office , " she told @entity92 's " @entity235 " in january			2
" not because politics are so tough , but it 's just not me			0
" " there is no way that i will do this because it 's really not me			0
i know my strengths and governor @entity8 needs to find someone who wants to run with him			0
there are many people who will do it very , very well			0
i 'll support the ticket , " @entity28 reiterated on @entity50 last month			2
what is @entity28 's response to the @entity24 " exclusive ? " this may speak for itself : she did n't respond to an e-mail and her chief of staff told us her past comments stand , and that she is on vacation and not available for further comment .			1

a @entity24 exclusive has stoked speculation about @entity0 as a potential *vp* pick
@entity28 would be a political two - fer as a @entity266 - @entity265 woman running mate
@entity28 's support for abortion rights would by problematic for social conservatives
@entity28 herself has said *fairly* *decisively* that she is not interested in the job
