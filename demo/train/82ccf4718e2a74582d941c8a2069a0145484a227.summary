-- with land come landslides			1
while they 're inevitable in many ways , people do n't inevitably have to die because of them			2
that line of thinking is being raised following @entity9 's disaster in @entity10 , where at least 17 people died and 49 structures were destroyed after a fast - moving landslide buried a square mile in up to 40 feet of mud			1
after a smaller landslide struck the same area in 2006 , officials invested millions of dollars to reduce the hazards , and residents felt safe , @entity10 emergency management director @entity21 contended this week			1
" we really did a great job of mitigating , " he told reporters			1
officials and many residents have long known they live in landslide country , @entity21 said			1
he cited how a 2010 @entity28 contains a chapter warning about the same land mass that collapsed a week ago			2
that tract was labeled as one of several potential " hot spots			2
" but no one had foreknowledge of saturday 's catastrophe , he asserted			2
" sometimes , big events just happen , " @entity21 explained			2
some experts and residents of @entity40 , @entity9 , now take sharp exception with @entity21			2
as rescue teams still seek survivors in the mud almost a week later , the disaster prompts new questions about how the local government allowed homes and a community to remain in the path of a potential landslide -- a peril that was highlighted as recently as 1999 in a @entity55 - based geomorphologist 's report to the @entity56			1
landslides are as endemic to the area as earthquakes are to @entity61 , experts say			1
last week 's landslide occurred on the lush western slopes of the @entity64 , where dense forests of 150 - foot firs are drenched with 120 inches of rain a year , sprouting a biomass greater than the @entity70 rain forests ' , said @entity71 of the @entity73 's @entity55 office			1
" this is a valley lined with landslides , going back 14,000 years when the glaciers left , " @entity71 said			1
" and before that there were n't any landslides because it was submerged under 3,000 feet of ice			1
" experts and residents now wonder whether more aggressive government action is needed for communities near sliding terrain			2
@entity9 gov. @entity85 acknowledged the seriousness of a broader review , but said the state has a more urgent matter -- finding additional survivors or bodies first			2
after that , authorities can then examine events leading to the landslide and how to safeguard against future ones			1
" we will get to the answer , " @entity85 told @entity0 this week			2
" it 's going to take some time			2
" @entity55 - based geomorphologist @entity100 said he would never have built a house around where the disaster occurred			1
he co-wrote the 1999 report for the @entity56 that looked at options to reduce sediments from landslides in the area			1
the 56 - page study identified " a very large volume of material that could potentially become unstable , " he said this week			2
" that 's the portion that appears to have failed in this event , " he said			0
@entity100 cautioned that his study never assessed risk			0
at the same time , he said that he believes his study was shelved by officials who could have done more than they did			1
@entity56 spokeswoman @entity116 said the study spoke to how people were living in the landslide area but the report was n't a risk assessment of landslide hazards			1
rather , the study was designed to look at restoring the ecosystem for the nearby @entity126 's fisheries			0
" what we 're looking at in those sites is silt entering the river and silt in salmon spawning beds , and could we do something to restore their habitat , " @entity116 said			0
" it 's documented in there that there was a risk of catastrophic failure and it was documented that people live there			0
but that was n't the purpose of the study			0
" the 1999 study clearly states a 60 - year history of landslides in the area , notably in 1937 , 1942 , 1951 , 1952 , 1967 and 1988			1
" i currently have no basis for estimating the probable rate or timing of future landslide activity , " @entity100 's study states			1
" the primary conclusion to be drawn is that mass wasting activity will persist for as long as the river remains at the toe of the landslide			1
" the proposed restoration project ended with @entity100 's study because there was no further funding from @entity166 and @entity10 , @entity116 said			1
though a state ordinance asks counties to map landslide hazards , it has not been translated into zoning restrictions , according to @entity100			1
local officials apprised residents of the perils as public improvements were made after the 2006 landslide , @entity21 said			1
one resident , however , challenged @entity21 's contention			0
" nobody ever told us that there were geology reports , " @entity179 told @entity0			0
" this is criminal , as far as i 'm concerned			0
" while authorities might have done more -- like making sure that all landowners knew about the risk -- that does n't absolve residents who built houses there , @entity100 said			1
" as landowners , we have some responsibility to be aware of our surroundings and their risks , " @entity100 added			0
while there were indications that a " very large " landslide was possible , no one knew how it might happen or how devastating it might be			1
" ultimately , there was no way to know when a landslide would occur , " @entity100 said			2
for @entity100 , the risk was too high			0
he found it incredulous to see new buildings go up after the 2006 landslide			1
" my reaction was to shake my head and say , ' this is nuts , ' " @entity100 said			1
among the attractions for residents is recreational fishing on the nearby river , prized for its trout and salmon , said @entity71 , the research geologist with the @entity73			0
housing is also relatively cheap , with the bonus of being in a beautiful mountain valley , he said			0
reinforcing the local recreational interests are @entity223 treaties with local @entity225 tribes dating back to the 1800s that ensure adequate fisheries in the river , @entity71 said			0
the river is often full of anglers in chest waders			0
" fishing is a big deal here in @entity9 , " @entity71 said			0
it 's also a place where residents do n't take kindly to government intrusions , he added			0
" this is a corner of the world where the majority of the people are very happy not to have much government regulations , " @entity71 said			0
" yet it 's also where we like to have the government tell us that we 're safe			0
" laser technology by low - flying aircraft now allows geologists like @entity71 to get a better picture of the topography underneath the dense @entity64 forests , he said			0
but much of that high - definition topography is unstudied , he said			0
" we have n't been able to catch up to the data because we have a whole lot more information than we have geologists or that we have funding for geologists , " @entity71 said			0
speaking as a @entity9 resident -- and not as government geologist -- @entity71 said reforms may be needed to ensure local officials impose stricter regulations in landslide zones			1
that may mean local governments have to relocate swaths of residences , he said			0
" we have home and communities in places where probably there should n't be homes and communities			2
how do you tell people to move ? " @entity71 asked			0
those decisions , he said , " will be heartbreaking " and " wo n't be easy			0
" @entity0 's @entity278 contributed to this report .			0

a geomorphologist studied the long history of landslides in @entity10
officials say they did " a great job of mitigating " landslide hazards
but an expert was incredulous to find homes being built after a 2006 landslide
" my reaction was to shake my head and say , ' this is nuts , ' " he says
