in a stunning reversal , the @entity1 's acting inspector general now says that long wait times at @entity1 health care facilities in @entity5 did contribute to a number of veterans ' deaths			1
in a hearing before the @entity11 wednesday , acting inspector general @entity9 was grilled by lawmakers about the findings of his office 's august report , which stated that while the investigation into 40 veterans ' deaths found " poor quality of care , " the office was " unable to conclusively assert that the absence of timely care caused the death of these veterans			1
" rep. @entity25 , @entity26 , insisted that @entity9 answer his questions in simple terms			2
" would you agree that wait lists contributed to the deaths of veterans ? yes or no ? " he asked			2
" yes , they do , " @entity9 replied			2
" i would say that it may have contributed to their death , but we ca n't say conclusively it caused their death			0
" committee chairman rep. @entity42 , @entity43 , said the report actually shows that 83 vets died while waiting for care , either on a hidden wait list or a scheduling wait list			0
additional information provided by the inspector general 's office to the committee shows " an astonishing 293 total veteran deaths on all of the lists provided from multiple sources throughout this review , " @entity42 said			1
for more than a year , @entity57 has been investigating and reporting on veterans ' deaths and delays at @entity1 facilities all across the country , including detailed investigations in november and january 2013 examining deaths at two @entity1 facilities in @entity66 and @entity67			1
whistleblowers have their say @entity9 's testimony confirms and even goes beyond the original allegations brought forth by dr. @entity72 , a retired @entity1 doctor , who first appeared on @entity57 in april with detailed allegations that as many as 40 @entity75 veterans had died in @entity5 , waiting for care at the @entity1			1
after @entity72 's revelations , several other whistleblowers stepped forward with similar accounts of veterans waiting for care and possible deaths due to the delays			1
in testimony before the committee wednesday , @entity72 accused the inspector general of stalling the investigation and protecting the senior officials responsible for perpetuating and hiding health care delays			1
@entity72 also alleged that the inspector general deliberately used confusing language and suppressed the finding that 293 veterans died waiting for care , a figure that was not included in the report			1
" this report is at best a whitewash and at worst a feeble attempt at a cover - up , " @entity72 testified			0
he also faulted va secretary @entity101 for not increasing transparency at the agency , as he promised he would , and for his vow to not tolerate whistleblower retaliation			0
" this report fails miserably in those areas with a transparency equivalent to a lead - line , 4 - foot - thick concrete wall , " @entity72 said			0
another whistleblower from the @entity1 also testified , charging that the inspector general downplayed evidence of harm to veterans and minimized the effects of medical administrators manipulating patient data and scheduling			1
whistleblower says investigation has been a ' whitewash ' dr. @entity123 , medical director of the @entity1 's @entity124 , critiqued the inspector general 's review of patient cases and said delays potentially caused two deaths and others significantly shortened the lifespan of some terminally ill veterans			1
" death is death , and there is no way to get those veterans back , " @entity133 said			0
wait times contributed to deaths lawmakers also heard from dr. @entity141 , an assistant inspector general who helped investigate the @entity1 , in wednesday 's hearing			1
rep. @entity143 , @entity144 , challenged the @entity146 's report finding that patient wait times could n't conclusively be linked to deaths			0
" to draw the conclusion , dr. @entity141 , that you did ... that it had no effect on the outcome of those patients , is outrageous , " @entity143 said angrily			0
" if this were your family member , would you be happy with the explanation you just gave of his death ? my suspicion is no. " from the other side of the aisle , rep. @entity162 , @entity163 , charged that " common sense tells you " delays in care could certainly be linked to deaths of patients			0
@entity141 also answered affirmatively to @entity25 's questioning about the relationship between wait lists and veterans ' deaths			2
" would you be willing to say that wait lists contributed to the deaths ? " rep. @entity25 , @entity26 , asked			0
the issue is cause , " @entity141 said			0
@entity1 inspectors say @entity5 was in total ' chaos ' problems at @entity1 in a document dated october 2013 that was recently obtained by @entity57 , the @entity188 conducted its own investigation into allegations that administrators incorrectly scheduled appointments and that senior officials discouraged the reporting of related problems			1
it issued a report saying many of the claims could not be substantiated			0
but when the @entity1 's @entity199 later investigated the same charges , it found that @entity1 staff members manipulated appointment data and that senior officials were aware of the inappropriate practices			1
the @entity188 did confirm in its 2013 internal report that the wait times for mental health appointments were " extremely long , " and that administrators discouraged patients from scheduling follow - up visits when they left the medical center			0
the @entity1 's 2013 report also found the process of hiring staff took too long , in some cases taking more than 60 days			1
but the @entity1 reportedly rejected the majority of allegations , which were raised by dr. @entity133 , the whistleblower who testified before @entity217 wednesday			0
on @entity133 's charge that @entity1 officials actively discouraged the reporting of scheduling problems , the @entity1 report found , " there have been no findings ... that substantiate these allegations			2
" many of @entity133 's allegations in 2013 centered on inappropriate use of the @entity1 's electronic wait list , a process for scheduling patients for next - available appointments			2
she charged that @entity1 administrators were not correctly trained on how to use this wait list and that they failed to appropriately track appointments , claims the inspector general later substantiated			1
at wednesday 's hearing , congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle repeatedly criticized and chastised @entity9 and his team of experts who examined what happened in @entity5 , with many lawmakers expressing exasperation and frustration that they were not getting truthful or clear answers			2
during the proceedings , @entity72 and @entity133 provided the committee with detailed reports containing allegations and information about what they see as a cover - up and conspiracy			0
committee members will be going through these documents in coming days .			0
