president @entity0 told a @entity2 meeting on tuesday that pollution must be contained to address climate change			1
specifically , he called out @entity5 , saying that the most populous country on @entity7 , with the fastest increase in carbon pollution , must join the @entity10 to lead the rest of the world in carbon reduction			0
" we have a responsibility to lead , " @entity0 said to applause			2
" that 's what big nations have to do			0
" @entity0 was speaking at the @entity20 , a one - day meeting hosted by @entity2 secretary - general @entity22 and open to leaders of all 193 @entity2 member states			1
wednesday begins the @entity26 meeting , which has marked climate change as one of its top issues as well			1
the event offers @entity0 a chance to shift the conversation away from the threat posed by @entity35 , @entity36 , and other national security matters and focus on an issue where he can tout accomplishments			2
hours after ordering strikes on @entity41 , @entity0 said that the " urgent and growing threat of climate change " would ultimately " define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other " issue			1
obtaining broad agreement to combat global climate change does not come easy , an issue the president addressed			1
for instance , @entity5 has been reluctant to stem the influx of energy production , as it 's in more demand			0
and in the @entity10 , the issue is controversial , with some claiming to believe that humans do n't cause climate change			1
" in each of our countries , there are interests that will be resistant to action			0
in each country there is a suspicion that if we act and other countries do n't -- that we will be at an economic disadvantage			0
but we have to lead , " @entity0 said			2
@entity0 painted a tragic picture caused by a changing climate in the @entity10 , detailing floods in @entity74 , wildfires in the @entity70 , hurricanes in the north and drought followed by excessive rain in the middle of the country			2
@entity0 noted that some countries are more impacted than others by climate change , but said , " no nation is immune			1
" actions announced the president unveiled a series of actions to urge the international community to cut emissions			2
he also announced measures to help developing countries better prepare for climate change			1
while efforts are still under way to meet and exceed goals set for 2015 , the president outlined a partnership plan to meet additional carbon reduction goals by 2020			2
" we can not condemn our children and their children to a future that is beyond their capacity to repair -- not when we have the means , the technological innovation and the scientific imagination to begin the work of repairing it right now , " he said			0
" i believe in the words of dr. @entity107 that there is such a thing as being too late			0
" actions taken so far in june 2013 , @entity0 announced a plan to cut carbon pollution , including directing the @entity10 @entity113 to establish new emission standards for active coal plants in the @entity10 , and working with other countries including @entity5 and @entity117 -- two of the world 's top emitters of greenhouse gases -- to establish new plans for addressing pollution globally			1
the plan included many executive actions -- things that do n't need approval from @entity127 , such as new standards for coal plants -- that were controversial			0
a year later , in june , 2014 , the @entity113 proposed a new plan designed to cut carbon emissions by 30 % by the year 2030			0
that plan has become a popular subject in several @entity133 races this year , including @entity134 and @entity135			0
still to be done for the environmental community , the next big frontier to tackle is methane emissions -- different from carbon emissions but , environmentalists say , just as important in the fight against climate change			1
" for us the big next steps include making a decision to address methane pollution from the oil and gas sector , " said @entity143 , director of the international climate campaign at the @entity145 , one of the country 's oldest environmental organizations			0
" that 's one of the biggest unresolved pieces			0
" polling a demonstration in @entity158 on sunday featuring appearances from @entity2 leader @entity22 and actor @entity160 , among others , turned out tens of thousands of supporters , but polling indicates that many @entity10 do not list addressing climate change as an issue they believe should be a top priority for the president and @entity127			1
a @entity169 research poll conducted earlier this year found that 29 % of respondents listed " dealing with global warming " as a top policy priority -- and that number has remained virtually unchanged since @entity0 took office in 2009			0
and a @entity176 poll conducted in march 2014 , found that a little under a fourth of @entity10 -- 24 % -- list climate change as a national problem that they worry about " a great deal			1
" however , when it comes to addressing climate change , polling indicates most @entity10 back action			1
a @entity176 poll from june found that 65 % of those surveyed support the government tightening pollution regulations on businesses .			0
