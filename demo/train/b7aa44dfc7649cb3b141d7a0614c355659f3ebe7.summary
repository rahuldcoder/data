president @entity0 has said that @entity2 president @entity1 has violated international law by sending troops into the @entity5			1
law is on @entity0 's side , which is why @entity1 is organizing his justification counter-offensive			1
the @entity10 charter ( article 2 ( 4 ) ) prohibits " the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state , or in any other manner inconsistent with the @entity19 of the @entity10			0
" @entity21 lawyers have said there are additional treaties @entity1 is violating			2
@entity1 's forces were apparently concerned enough about the @entity10 prohibition to strip the identifying markers off @entity2 soldiers before sending them into @entity5 , and to now call these troops " local defense forces			1
" but removing their insignias does not change the facts			0
@entity1 's new tactic is to claim that @entity2 has been invited in			1
it is illegal to invade another country , but not illegal to send in help when a legitimate government requests it			0
@entity1 has asserted that @entity21 's ousted president , @entity40 , remains the @entity21 's legitimate president , and he has asked for help			1
@entity1 may also be behind the influx of protest tourists to @entity21 who pretend they are @entity21 asking for @entity2 help			1
opinion : @entity1 's @entity21 endgame there is a long and storied tradition of governments inventing a legal premise to justify their actions			1
during the @entity56 , president @entity55 justified @entity58 intervention in @entity59 as necessary to protect @entity58 living on the island			0
@entity55 also defended @entity58 military support in @entity62 as collective self - defense requested by @entity64			0
these claims were just as credible as @entity1 's claims , which is to say : not very			0
@entity1 cares little whether his actions violate international law			1
but the @entity69 and @entity58 who will organize a response do care , and ordinary @entity2 may also care , which is why @entity1 is working to create the appearance of legal intervention			1
while only the @entity74 ( where @entity2 holds veto power ) can authorize a collective response to @entity2 aggression , the legal principle of " responsibility to protect " allows individual states and groups of states to legally justify their response to illegal acts of aggression			2
where might all this lead ? the answer depends on who ends up ruling @entity21			0
and this is the point			0
each side is now wooing its future dance partner : @entity58 and @entity69 are wooing @entity21 's @entity94 political forces , and @entity1 is stirring fears of ethnic @entity2 and seeking support for a @entity98 government			1
an anti-putin @entity21 government could try to bring a case to the @entity101 over the illegal use of force in @entity2 's incursion into @entity5			1
this is the strategy @entity107 leaders tried after @entity2 's last foreign intervention , but the effort failed			0
since @entity2 does not accept the @entity101 's general jurisdiction , @entity107 instead charged @entity2 with the illegal use of force , and with violating the @entity112 , which @entity2 has ratified			2
the @entity101 rejected jurisdiction in the case , however , because without @entity2 's preconsent the @entity101 could not decide claims about illegal force			2
for the racial discrimination convention , @entity107 would have to first try to negotiate with @entity2 over its disagreements			0
any @entity21 government would find itself similarly hampered			0
imagine that an anti-russian @entity21 government gained power and actually won its legal suit			0
then what ? in the best - case scenario , @entity21 would win a legal declaration on its side , which might make @entity2 liable to compensate @entity21 for its losses			1
@entity2 could then refuse to comply , or it could do what the @entity58 did to settle the illegal use of force suit that @entity62 won in front of the @entity101			0
@entity2 could require that @entity21 relinquish its claim if it wants to receive its aid package			2
and @entity21 would have few options , since @entity101 rulings can only be enforced by the @entity74 ( again , on which @entity2 holds veto power )			1
opinion : how @entity1 carries out power grab a more likely scenario is that the issue will never get this far			0
even if an @entity145 government wins the upcoming election , @entity21 is still too dependent on @entity2 energy to antagonize it by bringing a legal suit that will achieve so little			2
the @entity149 is not likely to become involved , in any event , since neither @entity2 nor @entity21 have ratified the @entity151 , which would give the @entity149 the right to claim jurisdiction over the case			1
nor would the @entity74 refer the matter to the court			0
the reality is that international law has little to offer right now			2
this will only be the case , however , as long as @entity2 does not engage in mass atrocities ; these would change the political calculus human rights violations can be pursued by @entity21 's new government , or by individuals raising legal claims in front of the @entity169 , where both @entity2 and the @entity21 are signatory members			2
@entity2 actually has a good record for paying awards ordered by the @entity169			0
at this point , international law 's largest contribution may be to channel @entity2 's response			1
international law is leading @entity1 to step back from the more overtly illegal strong - arm tactics associated with sending in troops , and he knows that any mass atrocities would provoke a more serious international response			1
international law wo n't stop an invasion , and in light of the events in @entity187 , odds are that neither side wants to escalate to the point of mass atrocities			2
so international law stands ready on the sidelines , a tool of both sides to justify their actions .			0

@entity197 : @entity0 says @entity1 violated international law ; @entity1 wants to make it look otherwise
she says @entity1 argues @entity21 asked for help . and @entity2 veto would let it block @entity10 response
she says @entity2 rejects much of international law 's jurisdiction . it 's not much help here
@entity212 : lawsuit from @entity21 likely would n't fare well , but threat helps channel @entity2 response
