-- small waves lap at the hulls of the ocean - going container ships as they approach the @entity5			0
some of these large boats have come from as far away as @entity7 , and the shelter of @entity9 is a relief after the @entity11 swells			0
the vessels are met by @entity13 , who 's been working these waters off the country 's @entity15 since 2010			2
" as a pilot it 's my job to take over from the captain when a captain gets close to the port , " he explains			2
" it 's my job to navigate him safely into the port , maneuver his vessel and then safely put it alongside the quayside			2
" this welcoming procedure guides ships into the province 's newest port , which is also a multi-billion dollar industrial park that 's growing faster than anyone expected			1
it 's this combination of maritime port and landside infrastructure just outside the city of @entity38 that is making the operation boom			1
" we started off with nothing , " @entity13 recalls			0
" people said that this will be a white elephant and that this will never be busy , " he adds			0
" we started off in october 2010 ... and from there on it 's grown -- from one ship a week , sometimes we do between five and 10 ships a day now , " he continues			1
" we 're 24 hours a day , so since the past four or five years that i 've been here it 's been growing every single week			2
" one reason not everyone was excited with the construction of @entity54 was that there were already seven other ports in operation in the country , whereas one of the stated aims of the authorities is to " minimize duplications " between shipping facilities			1
and even though approximately 96 % of the country 's exports are being conveyed by sea , some of these ports are n't performing as well as some regional competitors			0
@entity70 , the wholly state - owned freight business , is trying to improve the port sector by investing in cranes to move containers from ships to shore more efficiently			2
but a report by @entity77 blames " comparatively high tariffs payable by vessels calling at @entity5 ports " for the decline in shipping business			0
but these issues have n't stopped @entity54 from becoming the fastest growing terminal in the world in february 2013 , according to @entity86			1
and now the port is the third busiest in the country , only moving fewer containers than @entity90 and @entity91 according to the @entity92			2
' driving development ' and it 's not just the port that is seeing growth in the area			2
the on land set - up , with tax incentives , rebates and a duty - free zone at the state - owned @entity101 is changing the local economy			1
" the @entity101 industrial development zone has a very important role to play in the economic growth of the area , " says @entity104 , business development executive manager at the @entity101			1
" it is a strategic driver of development , firstly by bringing about a level of diversification in the regional economy to reduce it 's over dependence on the automotive sector , as well as agri - processing			2
but also to help increase the region 's ability to absorb its vast human resources			0
" the industrial zone created more than 13,000 jobs last year			1
a further 13,000 people received training there			1
one person to benefit from new skills is @entity128 who learned how to drive and is now a driving instructor			0
" @entity101 is a key role player as far as transforming the economy of the @entity15 , " he says			1
" the opportunities that come , strictly for employment , never mind big business , but just employing the ordinary person out there			0
" as well as individuals gaining skills and jobs , small and medium size businesses in the area are also benefiting from the zone			0
the @entity101 development corporation helped local design and advertising firm @entity145 get their bee certificate -- an accreditation that helps the business bid for work in @entity150			1
another local business that is seeing growth is @entity153 , and it 's @entity101 that makes up 40 % of their annual revenue			1
" @entity101 is very good for the business and for the province as well , " explains @entity156 , the company 's general manager			1
" up to this far even other companies , they 're flocking to the @entity15 and mainly because @entity101 is heading most of the projects here in the @entity15 and then it has helped our business to grow as well			1
we started with 3 employees , we 've got 20 employees now			0
" the port is allowing some small business owners to grow their existing operation , but it 's also leading to the beginnings of totally new businesses			0
@entity173 is a painting apprentice who 'll be a qualified artisan in three years			0
" i want to open my own company because there 's a shortage of artisan , especially in painting , " she explains			0
" also there 's no women that is an artisan in painting , so hopefully i 'll be the first			0
" while some of these successes prove the value of the port and industrial zone , there is much more to come			0
@entity70 's long - term plan for @entity54 includes increasing the total number of berths to more than 30 , and boosting the port 's capacity to 1.5 million containers per year			1
if it reaches that goal , the port would be nearly twice as busy as it is now			0
as the port expands , watery waves will continue lapping at the ship 's hulls and businesses hope they will see continued waves of growth in the local economy			1
