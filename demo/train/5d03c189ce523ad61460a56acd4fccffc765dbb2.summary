-- a federal judge has ordered the reinstatement of an openly lesbian former @entity4 major who was dismissed from the military under the government 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			1
judge @entity9 of @entity10 , @entity11 , made his ruling friday			2
it is the latest legal and political setback for the @entity15 administration , which is seeking to end the policy through a legislative and executive solution			0
maj. @entity18 , a decorated flight nurse with 20 years of service , had sued to return to the @entity20			1
she was honorably discharged in july 2007 on the grounds that she had a six - year relationship with another woman , a civilian			0
" her discharge from the @entity20 violated her substantive due process rights under the @entity26 to the @entity27			1
she should be restored to her position as a flight nurse with the 446th @entity31 as soon as is practicable , " wrote the judge			1
an @entity4 spokesman said the @entity4 believes that " @entity34 's discharge was fully consistent with the law and thus appropriate			1
" " while we are disappointed the district court judge did not agree that important congressionally - recognized military interests were furthered by @entity34 's discharge , we are pleased he allowed the government to develop a more detailed factual record for the appellate courts to consider , " said lt. col. @entity36			1
the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy enacted in 1993 prevents gay men and lesbians from openly serving in the military and bars officials from inquiring into a service member 's sexuality			1
the @entity50 this week temporarily turned aside legislation to repeal the law			2
@entity18 joined the @entity4 in 1987 and was suspended in 2004 , after her superiors discovered her personal relationship with the civilian woman			1
at the time , she worked for an air - medical transport unit that evacuated and treated wounded soldiers			2
she was described in employee reports and by trial witnesses as an " exemplary officer " who was an effective leader , caring mentor , and skilled clinician			0
she had hid her homosexuality for years			0
the judge found no compelling reason for her dismissal			1
" the application of ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' to @entity69 does not significantly further the government 's interest in promoting military readiness , unit morale and cohesion , " he wrote			1
in 2006 , @entity9 had ruled against @entity18 , but a federal appeals court had ordered him to take another look at the case			2
a six - day federal trial had wrapped up earlier this week , and @entity9 had openly indicated he would likely rule in @entity18 's favor			1
" my colleagues -- my friends -- said , ' @entity85 , you got it wrong , " ' @entity9 said near the end of the trial , referring to his earlier decision			0
" they told me what i needed to do , what i needed to ask			0
" the judge is a 2002 @entity90 appointee			0
@entity18 's lawyers from the @entity92 argued that the @entity95 native 's sexuality never led to any problems within her unit			1
several members of her squadron had testified they would welcome her back			0
" today we heard the hammer of justice strike for @entity69 , " said @entity92 of @entity11 executive director @entity100			0
" we look forward to the day when all members of our military can serve our country without invidious discrimination			0
to discharge her simply because of her sexual orientation was entirely unfair to her and unwise for the military , which needs her significant skills			2
" @entity18 was released just before she was set to retire with full benefits			2
the judge rejected a separate argument from @entity18 that her procedural due process rights were violated			1
@entity9 said the @entity4 gave her full notice of the charges against her and she was given the opportunity to challenge the charges			2
@entity4 lawyers argued the military -- not the courts -- was in the best position to evaluate and enforce the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			1
a federal judge in @entity126 earlier this month had similarly ruled the policy unconstitutional			0
that judge will soon rule on whether the @entity129 will be barred from enforcing it			0
president @entity15 is pushing for a repeal of the controversial policy			0
a bill that would overturn the measure after a @entity129 review is completed in december is currently before @entity135			0
more than 12,500 gays have been booted from the military since " do n't ask , do n't tell " went into effect .			0
