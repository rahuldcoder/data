-- an insider shares five top experiences in @entity4 , @entity5 , you wo n't read about in guidebooks			1
@entity7 is one of several scenic houseboat communities in @entity4			1
off - the - path pier you 'll want a bike or a car to get to the @entity14 fishing pier , which sits in the shadow of the @entity16 and has unbeatable views across the bay to @entity19			1
in summer , foghorns bellow loudly from here , but in december , fishermen and pelicans are more the order of the day			0
a short walk north is eco-luxe @entity26 : the @entity27 at the @entity28 , which was big news in town when it debuted last summer			1
even if you do n't stay there , stop for a glass of wine in the clubby @entity35			0
locals ' beach @entity38 is a bit farther from downtown , but still doable on foot and well worth finding			0
my son and i have whiled away many sunny mornings here , wading in the bay and watching sailboats			1
the beach bumped up to our number one favorite in april with the addition of @entity52 , a @entity54 bistro steps from the sand and , hands down , the best new restaurant in town in ages			0
grab a seat next to the roll - up glass garage door and definitely try the mussels @entity62			2
@entity63 : 20 perfect summer trips undiscovered hike you ca n't spend time in @entity4 and not make it to the @entity69 , just a mile outside town -- it 'd be like going to @entity71 and missing @entity72			1
so join the parade of cars winding up twisty @entity75 to @entity77 , but do n't stop there			0
drive a bit farther to the beach parking area on your left , and you 'll see signs for the trail to @entity86			0
the 0.75 - mile hike down ( slightly rickety ) steps is sure to put the rosy in your cheeks , and the narrow strip of beach is windy , wild and stunning			2
my secret ? instead of starting from the beach parking area , i like to drive past the @entity93 , turn right on @entity94 , and start at the historic rifle range			0
it 's worth the extra 1.5 miles over the ridge for the views you 'll have all to yourself			2
@entity63 : our amazing national parks best shopping street there 's more to @entity4 shopping than the chintzy souvenir shops that line the main drag downtown			1
just a 10 - minute walk north of the waterfront lies leafy caledonia street , home to several locally owned galleries and framing shops , plus @entity113 , where we always find deals on used cookbooks			1
i love to look at the black - and - white photography at @entity119 and pick up letterpress holiday cards and fashionable ribbons and papers for present wrapping at @entity124			2
and one block to the east on @entity127 is @entity128 , with streamlined modern container gardens , handcrafted fountains and outdoor furniture			0
@entity63 : outdoor dining rooms hidden harbor @entity4 would n't be @entity4 without its houseboats			1
among several houseboat communities in town , @entity7 stands out for its hilarious , only - in - @entity4 message board at the harbor entrance			1
on my all - star list : " lost : plywood dinghy , battered blue " ( alongside a charmingly rakish drawing of the poor lost boat ) and " want to exchange your houseboat with mine in @entity148 for a week ? " impressive feats of container gardening -- succulents , roses , lemon trees -- line the boardwalk , and residents are often out watering plants in the early morning			2
truth be told , i did once catch a minibus of @entity160 tourists being let off in this area , but that was in the height of summer , and they seemed to walk right past @entity164 , our favorite spot			0
