-- @entity1 is many things : a self - proclaimed geek , a blogger , an entrepreneur -- and according to him , an average gamer			0
the 38 - year - old founder of blogging network @entity8 loves the casual game			1
the pick - it - up , put - it - down , stress - free app. @entity1 has played his share of games like " @entity16 " and " a monster ate my homework			1
" he even jumped on the " @entity19 " bandwagon , but found the @entity22 - like game to be a little too much work			1
" the problem with games is they 're usually so overly complex			0
if i ca n't figure it out within a minute , i move on , " said the @entity28 resident , who is an occasional @entity0 contributor			0
" and you know , there are lot more people like me than people who would take a lot of time to get into a game			1
" then came " draw something			1
" @entity1 came across the game -- a digital variation on @entity41 , with a dash of @entity43 -- recently while browsing the latest apps on his @entity45			1
he downloaded it , connected to @entity47 and started playing			0
now @entity1 easily blows through a couple of hours a night playing the game			1
" what draws people is the drawing , " @entity1 said with a laugh			1
" everyone likes to doodle			0
who does n't like to doodle ? it 's fun , it 's easy , it does n't take any thinking			1
not any , but just a little			0
" the app , created and released by gaming developer @entity61 , has enjoyed unbelievable success in its short life			1
it has attracted more than 35 million users in the two months since its release -- a remarkable amount for a game that has no clear - cut winners , losers or " @entity74 " - like levels of achievement			1
" @entity75 " spent weeks as the no. 1 free app on the @entity45 and @entity77 , and @entity61 was snapped up last month by @entity78 , the king of the social - gaming industry , for about $ 200 million			1
how it works playing the game is simple once you scan your social - network contacts for someone to play with			1
the app gives you three choices of things to draw ; you pick a word and then draw it with your finger on the touchscreen , using the basic colors provided in the app. your friend hopefully deciphers your picture and guesses it correctly , then draws a picture for you in return			1
the back and forth continues in an addictive cycle			0
there 's no winner ; instead , players work together to build streaks of correctly guessed drawings			1
@entity106 , former ceo of @entity61 turned a vice president of @entity78 , said they were inspired to create something that was close to a party game -- targeted at everyone and not too competitive			1
" we wanted to be that game that was on the phone of the people who had no other games on their phone , " @entity106 said			1
" we thought it would do well			0
but we were shocked that it did this well			0
" the point system complements the easygoing nature of the game			2
players have the ability to pick from a list of three words , which range in difficulty			2
harder words are worth more virtual coins , which can be cashed in for features or hints within the game			2
what 's interesting is how these points work			2
the person drawing gets coins if the other player guesses it correctly			1
the person guessing is given the same number of coins for guessing it			2
@entity1 thinks this system is very intelligent			0
" it 's not a competition , it 's about collaboration , " he said			1
" you owe it to the other person as a player to get what 's in your head			1
" this may be a factor of why the game is thriving in more than 80 countries , in the hands of people of all ages			2
@entity106 thinks @entity78 's support and infrastructure will enable them to make significant improvements to the game -- such as incorporating a chat feature or letting players save their drawings within the app. currently , players must use the screen - grab function on their phone or tablet to save images of their drawings			1
a game of leisure @entity177 , a 50 - year - old mother of two and the manager of @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity181 , was invited to play the game on her @entity45 by her daughters in the @entity184			1
she says the main appeal of " @entity75 " is that it 's a game of leisure , as opposed to a game like " @entity188 " where you are working against the clock			1
" you 're relaxed , you 're playing it at your own time and pace , you erase it , then you draw it again , " she said with a laugh			2
players say being able to draw a word at their own pace , in whatever style they choose , opens new windows of creativity and self - expression			1
to @entity207 , it 's also a window into your partner 's mind			2
" when you 're drawing , you 're illustrating what you 're thinking , " she explained			2
this thought process is visible in full when playing the game , which shows your drawing being created , line by line , as your partner tries to guess what it is			1
once a line is off your fingertip and onto the digital canvas , there is no retracting it -- you can erase and start over , although the entire process , including all your mistakes , will be recreated for your partner as well			0
this is unnerving to a number of people , especially if they feel their artistic skills are not up to par. @entity207 admits that she did n't like the game at first because she does n't consider herself to be a great artist			2
" i think what inhibits people from maybe playing a lot of this game is their drawing skills , " she said			1
but that did n't stop her from trying			0
" once i got used to it and figured out all the colors and the thickness of the pen and stuff , i realized i could do a lot of things			0
" users agree that , like @entity41 , success at " @entity75 " is not about artistic talent but about providing the right clues for the other person			2
" i think anybody who can draw a face -- not a proper face , but two dots and a nose and a smile , can play , " said @entity207 , who has hit a streak of 80 correctly guessed drawings in one of her games			1
lost in translation ? words and celebrities from present - day popular culture -- say , @entity269 , or @entity270 -- make the game refreshing for some players			1
for others , they 're more of a hurdle			0
even @entity1 , some years younger than @entity207 , said he has trouble guessing words like " @entity278 , " the rapper			2
he also would n't play the word " @entity281 " for his mother			0
" i do n't know if she would have the same cultural language everyone else has , " @entity1 said			0
the game 's @entity184 - centric cultural references also throw some international players off			1
to @entity207 , " football " does not mean the same thing in @entity290 or @entity181 as it does in @entity184 , and the word " @entity294 " results in a mental blank			0
twenty - one - year - old @entity296 of @entity297 faces similar cultural and lingual battles daily on " @entity75			0
" " some of [ the words ] are weird , " the @entity300 student said			0
" but you can check them in the dictionary			0
" that does n't discourage @entity296 from playing			0
in fact , he finds it a great learning experience			0
" this is helpful for learning more @entity310 , which is very good in my opinion , " he said			0
" enjoyment plus knowledge is great			0
" @entity78 's @entity106 addressed some of these issues when speaking with @entity0			2
" i would love to do more stuff that is relevant for an international audience , " he said			0
" we are about to put a slew of famous footballers in the game for the @entity323 , for example			2
" a new way to connect meanwhile , " @entity75 " players continue to share their scribbled masterpieces , their private doodles and their sometimes embarrassing trains of thought			2
players say that while you can play with strangers , the game is a unique and intimate way to communicate with parents , significant others and kids			1
@entity207 loves playing with her daughter , and even her daughter 's boyfriend , in the @entity184			0
for her , it 's a new way of keeping in touch with loved ones who are far away			0
@entity1 , who has hit round 79 with his wife , sees " @entity75 " as a different way of connecting to someone you know so well			0
" i am not much of an artist , but i am learning more how to make people laugh in the game , " @entity106 said			0
" i also like to play with my sons @entity355 and @entity356 , as it gives me a window into how they think			0
" @entity106 saves and cherishes many of their drawings .			0
