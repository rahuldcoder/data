-- imagine a world where anyone could be like @entity3 in the " @entity3 " movies -- manipulating @entity6 images in thin air			1
that future could be a lot closer than you think			0
a @entity12 startup called @entity13 is creating augmented - reality glasses that will let you interact with virtual objects in the real world			1
" it elicits this very magical effect where you could literally place holograms on the real world , reach out and touch them with your hands , " said @entity17 , @entity13 founder and ceo			1
@entity17 , 28 , is the brains behind the technology			0
originally from @entity29 , he moved to the @entity30 seven years ago to study computer science and neuroscience at @entity33			0
as a student , he began contemplating what the next computer could be			0
" all i knew was that i wanted an infinite computer screen , and i wanted to be able to touch holograms and stick them on parts of the real world , " he said			1
@entity17 launched the company in december 2012 and moved to @entity41 with help from @entity43 , which helps fund and nurture promising tech startups			0
he now lives and works with 25 employees in a @entity48 mansion overlooking @entity12 and has four other properties where employees sleep at night			0
" we all live together , work together , eat together , " he said			0
" at certain key points of the year we have mattresses lined all around the living room			0
" it 's not a typical work environment , but what @entity17 is creating is far from ordinary			2
he believes @entity13 glasses could change computing as we know it			1
" the fundamental game changer that we 're bringing to the table is this application that allows you to take your phone , tablet and soon personal computer and project them in @entity6 in your environment when they 're not actually there , " he said			1
if this happens , it could usher in the next generation of computing using your hands and a pair of glasses			2
he believes the potential applications are endless			1
" we 've had surgeons apply for this because they want to be able to perform surgery while seeing a @entity6 cat scan , " @entity17 said			1
" we 've had architects apply for this because they want to be able to build houses with their hands collaboratively			0
" eventually , @entity17 says , the glasses could also be used for 3 - d @entity89 sessions			2
" you could actually put on these glasses and see a @entity6 render of your mother from all the way across the country in @entity96 sitting on the chair in your room here in @entity41 , " he said			1
the first version of the glasses , a developer edition , is selling for around $ 700			2
the glasses are set to be delivered in december , @entity17 said			2
@entity13 is also creating 3 - d apps that range from virtual @entity105 to surgery applications			1
but soon developers from around the world will have a chance to weigh in			2
" we 're going to start off by perfecting five or six applications that showcase the differences from other form factors , " @entity17 said			2
" but soon thereafter we 're going to open this up to developers worldwide , and they 're going to come up with things that we could n't even imagine			2
" in a demonstration video provided by @entity13 , a woman uses the glasses to sculpt a virtual vase with her fingers before printing it in @entity6 , while others play chess on a virtual board			1
so how does the technology work ? " the glasses are ... a two - part system			2
the first is a @entity6 output display that 's built with a stereoscopic pair of see - through augmented - reality glasses			1
the 3 - d output display allows you to see the holograms in @entity6 , " @entity17 said			1
" the 3 - d scanner scans your environment and tells the computer where to place the @entity6 graphics relative to the user and the world			1
" unlike @entity143 's rival glass eyewear , which has a smaller screen and is primarily controlled by your voice , @entity13 glasses could have the potential for an infinite screen controlled by your hands			1
" @entity143 is going to take one category of wearable computing , the notification machine , " @entity17 said			0
" @entity13 is a graphical solution that 's going to allow people to build ' @entity3 ' - like interfaces and interact with digital information in a much more natural way graphically			1
" until then , there are some limitations			0
the first version can only be used indoors			0
the company also is working on increasing the field of view , improving latency issues and making the glasses smaller and less bulky			2
within two years , @entity17 says , the glasses will be as sleek as a pair of @entity166			0
but stylish specs with built - in computer technology do raise the inevitable questions about privacy			0
" i 'm highly concerned with those issues			0
... i have a fundamental belief that when you and i are talking and you 're recording information about me , i should know about it , " @entity17 said			0
" there will be an led light indicating that you 're being recorded if that 's the situation			0
" if @entity17 has his way , hardware like the desktop computer , keyboard and mouse could soon be a thing of the past			0
" we 're looking to change the way people interact with computers by making them much more natural , " he said			1
" every application from the 2 - d world can enter the @entity6 world now			1
it really represents a huge shift from @entity195 computing			0

a startup is creating glasses that let you interact with virtual objects in the real world
glasses let you place @entity6 holograms in real world , then reach out and touch them
ceo of startup @entity13 : the potential applications are endless
" we 're looking to change the way people interact with computers , " he says
