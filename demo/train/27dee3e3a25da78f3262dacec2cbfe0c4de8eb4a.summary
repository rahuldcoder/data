-- you can be sure of one thing			0
unless of course we die and go somewhere where you can write , drink , have sex , appear on tv and , above all else , talk			2
i once asked @entity3 his philosophy of how to conduct your life			1
the immediate answer : " never turn down an opportunity for sex or being on tv			0
" he wrote enough for 10 men			0
aside from his prodigious output of novels , historic and political essays , movies , tv scripts and hit plays , he was -- i feel safe in saying -- the best talker since @entity27			2
i got to spend a lot of time with @entity3 , on and off the air , and there was always a sort of afterglow			1
you felt you had just had a lovely bath in the elegant and witty use of our sadly declining @entity38 language			2
@entity3 's talk , if transcribed , could be printed without editing			1
if there seemed to be some preening in his prepared remarks on television -- and he knew a good line was worth repeating -- it was outweighed by the quality of the verbal prose			0
in my notorious show known now through the ages as " @entity52 / @entity53 , " there was a particular answer of @entity3 's to a challenge by @entity56 that actually got applause for , i think , its simple elegance : @entity3 had gotten a laugh , a feat difficult for @entity56 to achieve			1
the exchange went : @entity56 : why do n't you try to talk just once , @entity3 , without yuks ? why not just talk to me instead of talking to the audience ? @entity3 : well , by a curious thing we have not found ourselves in a friendly neighborhood bar , but both , by election , are sitting here with an audience , so therefore it would be dishonest of us to pretend otherwise ( applause )			1
hard to imagine @entity75 fashioning that sentence			0
much ink was spilled all over the country about that show			0
asked by a journalist what comment he had about @entity56 's head - butting him backstage , @entity3 said , " once again , words failed @entity56			1
" opinion : @entity3 's magnificent strengths , appalling weaknesses my late wife and @entity3 became great friends			1
they laughed constantly together , often on the subject of their mutual knowledge of dwelling in the @entity94			0
@entity3 's favorite was her description of an elegant family dinner table in @entity99 with much lace and candles and crystal and the elderly matriarch -- bedecked in rich brocade and a jeweled tiara -- making her way unsteadily to the table after a touch or two of bourbon and @entity110 upstairs			1
moments later , when she pitched forward into the cold soup , a family member , wielding a napkin and skilled in @entity116 euphemism , would invariably say , " @entity117 's tired			2
" @entity3 later signed a book to my late wife , " for @entity120 : so tah 'd			1
" she always said of him that for a man who describes himself as bisexual , " @entity3 really , really likes women			1
" like all writers ( it 's almost safe to say ) he was a big drinker			2
( see @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity56 , et al			0
) i once startled @entity3 by saying i 'd just read that each drink kills more than 10,000 brain cells			1
" but you 've got billions of brain cells , " i reassured him			0
@entity3 responded : " but i 've had billions of drinks			1
" quotes of his are collected			0
it would be hard to dislike a man who was opposed to gay marriage " ... because heterosexual marriage is such a disaster , why would anyone want to imitate it ? " or of @entity147 : " the only genius i 've ever known with an iq of 60			0
" opinion : my friend , il maestro @entity3 i do n't have @entity3 's exact wording , but he once urged the idea that anyone who professes himself qualified to run for president of the @entity156 should be immediately stopped and prevented from doing so			1
he once made the statement -- only partially seriously ? -- that the country 's problems were all potentially curable by the simple method of listening to what he said			2
he ran the only witty political campaign this side of @entity164			2
he likely would not have made a great occupant of the @entity166 , but imagine the fun of those press conferences ! i once did a half - hour show , seen on @entity170 , with @entity3 from his fabulous castle - like home perched above a gorgeous valley at @entity174 , @entity175			1
jet lag awoke me early one morning , and i peeked into his closed writing room			0
an old - style royal typewriter sat at the precise center of a long , heavy antique table			0
books extended outward from both sides of the typewriter for a couple of feet in both directions , all of them written by the occupant			0
i closed the door again , quietly , and got my breath			0
the fact that some feel his greatest work is in his collected essays should be a word to the wise			0
what a man and what a loss			0
i do n't see how anyone could say or think anything negative about one who said , " success is not enough			1
@entity204 's friends must fail			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			2

@entity207 : unless there 's *debauchery* , talk in the *afterlife* , @entity3 hates being dead
@entity207 says his friend was a *wonderful* talker and witty , *eloquent* and *prolific* writer
@entity207 : you ca n't think ill of one who said , " success is not enough . @entity204 's friends must fail "
