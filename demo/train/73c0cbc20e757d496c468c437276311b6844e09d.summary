-- house speaker @entity1 dampened prospects for emergency action by @entity4 addressing the immigration crisis on the southern border before lawmakers break for their august recess			1
" i do n't have as much optimism as i 'd like to have , " @entity1 told reporters on thursday			2
the @entity12 administration has warned that some federal agencies dealing with the surge of minors crossing the border , many of them unaccompanied , will run out of money sometime in august			1
the @entity20 and @entity21 will return after @entity22			1
the major sticking point is whether @entity4 should change a 2008 law requiring that child migrants from @entity26 receive a hearing before any decision is made to deport them			1
critics say the @entity31 - era law has made the @entity32 a magnet for children fleeing @entity35 , @entity36 , and @entity37			2
they argue there should be an accelerated process to deport them , just like there is for children who enter the country illegally from @entity44 or @entity45			0
sen. @entity46 and @entity49 rep @entity47 , both of @entity50 , have introduced a bipartisan bill to modify the 2008 law and some version of their plan is expected to be attached to any @entity20 @entity57 package that includes emergency funding for border efforts			1
but top @entity21 and @entity20 @entity49 , and virtually all @entity62 lawmakers , are balking at the change			1
@entity65 @entity64 , who recently said she was open to accepting a change now opposes tying that to new funding			2
@entity64 told reporters thursday that any debate to reverse the law should be done separately , as part of comprehensive immigration reform			0
president @entity12 has proposed $ 3.7 billion in emergency funding to address the matter			1
he also does not advocate changing the 2008 law			0
@entity1 insisted , however , that that the law in question must be addressed			1
" i do n't know how @entity4 can send more money to the border to begin to mitigate the problem if do n't do something about the ' 08 law that 's being abused , and it is being abused , " he said			1
@entity20 @entity57 aides say republicans are working on a package smaller than the one proposed by @entity12 with some policy changes			1
they expect to vote on it before the end of july			0
@entity1 's office said it has been involved in some bipartisan negotiations addressing the 2008 law			1
referencing her own shift in position , @entity64 said she never likes " to draw a line in the sand , " noting that she was open " to seeing what 's there " two weeks ago			0
but now " what we 've seen so far is going in the wrong direction and if they want @entity49 votes it 's got to go in the right direction , " @entity64 said			0
in the @entity20 , @entity1 will need some @entity49 support to pass a bill because there is a contingent of @entity20 conservatives who do n't want to approve any more money for @entity12 administration 's efforts			1
if @entity64 and other top @entity49 leaders stand firm , and @entity62 and progressive lawmakers vote no on a @entity57 package it could complicate getting something out of the @entity20			2
immigration crisis is a political conundrum over to the @entity21 according to senior @entity21 @entity49 sources , the caucus is fairly evenly divided between those who can accept proposed changes to the 2008 law in order to help speed passage of the funding and those who are unwilling to alter a law that was designed to provide due process to children who may be victims of crimes related to human trafficking			1
another wrinkle in the push to finalize a deal is a proposal from conservative @entity50 @entity136 sen. @entity136			0
@entity136 introduced legislation to prevent @entity12 from granting deportation deferments in the future			2
@entity12 signed an executive order two years ago allowing many young people who were brought to the @entity32 illegally when they were children to stay			2
@entity136 said such acts of " amnesty " are deepening the current crisis by creating the impression that the children coming across the border now will eventually be allowed to stay			0
@entity136 told reporters the focus of his bill is solving the problem			0
" what is causing this humanitarian crisis is that these children believe they will be granted in the future amnesty			0
so this legislation directly addresses that problem by prohibiting the president from granting amnesty from this day forward , " @entity136 said			0
@entity1 sidestepped a question about @entity136 's proposal saying there are lots of discussions going on about how to address the border crisis			1
@entity46 seemed to embrace the idea , although he told reporters he needed time to think through the ramifications			0
asked about @entity1 's pessimism about getting a deal done this month , @entity46 worried about the situation worsening because of the impasse in @entity173			2
" what happens if nothing happens is that the problem continues and continues to escalate			0
we 're already seeing backlash from communities all over the country where these children are being placed and people are starting to realize they need to educate , house and raise these children , " he said			0
" i think there will be more negative reaction directed at the president and @entity4 if we do n't act , " he said			0
immigrants or refugees ? a difference with political consequences @entity57 confident congress will pass bipartisan border remedy not in my backyard : communities protest surge of immigrant kids			2

house speaker @entity1 dampens chances of legislation passing soon
*competing* proposals *floating* around both the @entity20 and @entity21
@entity12 has proposed $ 3.7 billion in emergency funding , others want to change migrant law
it 's all about the surge of kids at the southern border from @entity26
