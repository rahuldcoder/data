-- fifty years after the @entity2 was meant to represent the beginning of a " world church " in the @entity1 , the @entity1 is still predominantly eurocentric in her teachings , structures , and personnel			1
the shift in the center of gravity in world @entity11 from the @entity13 to the @entity14 , and the changing demographics in world @entity11 , demands that the eurocentric types and models of church and @entity11 need to be abandoned			0
@entity22 , like all local @entity20 throughout the world , can only flourish when it has the freedom to mine local and cultural resources and to develop its own narrative of faith and life , while embracing the positive heritage of @entity1 and @entity30 history			1

other issues which many @entity40 see as needing urgent action are clerical celibacy , the place of women in the church , the problems of a high rate of divorce , the place of homosexuals in the church , the anguish of divorced and separated @entity33 , the use and abuse of authority in the church , and some of the polarizing arguments on abortion and contraception			0
however , sometimes these problems in their @entity13 variants are presented as the universal templates to view the challenges facing the @entity1 in all parts of the world			1
similar problems do exist in @entity32 catholicism , but they manifest themselves in different ways and for different reasons			2
in @entity32 catholicism , for example , there are few incidents of pedophile priests , but that does not mean that the church in @entity32 does not have its own demons with regard to sexual misdemeanors of its clergy with adult females			2
many @entity32 value families because having children is the only way an @entity32 achieves personal immortality , by becoming an ancestor			0
as a result , the concern of some @entity33 for the church to have an open and honest discussion on celibacy is not driven out of concern for the loneliness or isolation that priests suffer in the @entity13 , but rather by the belief that having a wife and children culturally enhances one 's humanity and is a good thing for the community and the individual priest			0
some @entity1 priests and bishops who secretly have had their own children were driven not simply by some unchecked and repressed libidinous upsurge , but by a cultural pressure to procreate and thus guarantee ancestral life beyond death			0

on the other hand , many @entity32 women in the @entity1 are silently bearing the weight of an @entity32 brand of @entity22 that reinforces a traditional @entity32 patriarchal mentality that women should not have a voice , and that they should be subordinate to men			1
@entity1 women would like to see the end to all kinds of sexual , physical , and emotional abuses of women in marriages , sexual harassment and exploitation in public offices and in some churches , and the suppression of the rights of women in @entity32 society			1
@entity1 women are praying for a future pope who will encourage @entity32 religious leaders to commit themselves to defending the rights of women to inheritance , land and to divorce , so that gender equality and respect for the dignity of the @entity32 woman can be achieved			1
whereas abortion and contraception are divisive issues in @entity152 , most @entity32 @entity33 embrace this teaching because most @entity32 cultures reject abortion and contraception			0
however , @entity32 @entity33 are more concerned that the use of condoms to prevent @entity159 should be understood as a therapeutic means to protect and preserve life			0
it should be seen in this light as actually a morally legitimate pro-life act , rather than anti-life			0
@entity32 @entity33 look forward to the future pope introducing new and effective measures to check the seeming absolute powers and privileges of @entity32 bishops and priests			2
there is a troubling clericalism in @entity22 that is similar to , and in some cases worse than , the dictatorial tendencies , corruption and lack of accountability among @entity32 politicians			1

the reason that religion is so central to @entity32 , and for the appeal of @entity22 , is because most @entity32 believe that @entity188 can intervene in their longs nights and dark days of suffering and uncertainty about the future			2
many @entity32 hope that the future pope will challenge his fellow @entity32 bishops and priests to become the voice of the voiceless , and to not live above the people or exploit their vulnerability			1
@entity198 , and @entity11 in particular , has become for many @entity32 a shopping mall where they experiment with all kinds of solutions to their existential problems			0
many might argue that @entity11 lacks depth because people 's allegiance to one church or religion is not firm : an @entity1 can consult with an @entity32 traditional healer in the morning and take the same problem to a @entity211 pastor in the afternoon , and then bring the same issue for prayer at a @entity214 in the evening			1
however , in an atmosphere of so much suffering and pain , the search for religious options becomes a viable pathway			0
@entity32 @entity33 expect the next pope to raise the bar of ethical , prophetic , sacrificial , and servant leadership in @entity22 -- and to hoist the banner of righteousness and moral rectitude , and political activism and solidarity , to lift millions of @entity32 from the pit of poverty so that they will have a voice and contribute in building a better society			1
the @entity32 church should be a church of the poor , a church with the poor , a church for the poor and a church that is on the side of the poor so as to give them a voice			0
next pope from @entity32 or @entity241 ? africans , like most @entity33 , hope that the future pope will be a humble , holy , wise and compassionate servant leader , who is able to communicate the teachings of the @entity1 with compassion and tenderness			1
such a pope must also be a listening pope who will not be afraid to engage the modern world , in order to discern the signs of the times and embrace the beauty of the new revelations which @entity188 is manifesting in today 's world			0
