@entity1 , @entity0 -- since the 2011 revolution , @entity0 have seen near non-stop protests , the toppling of two presidents , six elections , and a seemingly endless political crisis			1
but what they have n't witnessed yet is what has been demanded all along -- a better economy			2
as the country goes to the polls next week to elect a new president , both candidates insist this is something they can be trusted to deliver			1
former army chief @entity17 pledges new roads , housing , airports , jobs and an end to the energy crisis			0
@entity25 's lone opponent , left leaning politician @entity26 , has vowed to dish out millions of dollars in investments to help reopen government factories , create new jobs , build new housing and improve health care			1
but has either candidate offered specifics on how they will get things done ? " not yet , " said @entity1 based economist , @entity36			0
" we 've still got a few weeks before elections but the pressure is growing on both of them to come up with plans and that includes @entity25			0
" @entity36 believes that in order to deliver on campaign promises , @entity0 's next president must attract investors from both inside and outside @entity0 through large scale economic reform			1
" it 's not going to be easy , " he added			0
" the problems are surmountable but i have to say the structural problems of @entity0 's economy are enormous			1
" these problems include rising food prices , unemployment at roughly 14 % and a crippling budget deficit of around 12 % of gdp			0
on top of all that , passions are still running high over the ousting and trial of former president @entity62 who was removed from his post by the army in 2013			2
a critical step to recovery , many business - minded economists say , is cutting costly food and fuel subsidies that eat up roughly one third of @entity0 's budget			1
but for the country 's poor , cutting subsidies will be an extremely tough pill to swallow			0
to ease the impact , @entity36 says @entity0 's next leader must launch projects to help the masses -- like improving transport and affordable housing -- that can be kick - started by billions of aid received from @entity84			2
" if the right policies are in place , @entity0 will respond quickly , " @entity36 said			2
" but changing sentiment is the key by putting right policies and right people in place to show something is changing			0
" only then , he concludes , can @entity0 's next president truly improve the economy and meet the demands of millions of @entity0 still waiting for a better life three years after revolution came to the country			1
