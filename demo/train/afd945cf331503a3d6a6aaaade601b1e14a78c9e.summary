@entity0 -- a series of black eyes for the @entity6 -- including a new report that says supervisors mishandled a 2011 shooting incident at the @entity3 -- should be viewed with the agency 's broader mission in mind , a top @entity3 official said on sunday			1
@entity13 , president @entity14 's deputy national security adviser , said the new revelation , along with an episode earlier this month that saw an armed intruder gain access inside the executive mansion , were blips for an otherwise stalwart security force			1
" let 's put this in perspective , " @entity13 said			0
" the men and women of the @entity6 put their lives on the line for the @entity28 , his family , and folks working in the @entity3 every single day , 24 hours a day			1
their task is incredible , and the burden that they bear is incredible			0
" " i know the @entity6 is on top of this and they will take every necessary step to correct any problems , " he said			2
@entity13 spoke to @entity1 's chief political correspondent , @entity39 , on " @entity40			0
" late saturday , the @entity41 reported that @entity6 officials initially dismissed a series of gunshots that struck the @entity3 in 2011 as backfire from a vehicle near the @entity46 , ordering officers on the scene to " stand down			1
" when it became clear shots were fired , officials said they came from opposing gang members and were not intended for the @entity3			1
the @entity6 tells @entity1 that it was an uncertain situation			0
officers could not ascertain the direction from which shots originated due to probable echoing of the sounds between the buildings around the @entity3			2
a @entity6 spokesman said the shots were fired over a quarter mile away from the @entity3 which added to the uncertainty			1
how @entity6 could beef up @entity3 security immediately following the incident , the @entity6 said it notified police and initiated a protective sweep around the outer perimeter of the @entity3			1
officers found no suspect , injured persons or property damage			0
but damage from the gunshots , which the @entity41 said totaled nearly $ 100,000 , was later found on the @entity75 , outside the president 's private residence , by a housekeeper			1
bullets shattered historic windows but were stopped by a layer of bulletproof glass underneath			0
while the president and first lady were out of town at the time of the incident , their two daughters and mrs. @entity85 's mother were in @entity0			1
@entity92 filings later showed the shooter , @entity94 of @entity95 , @entity96 , parked his car south of the @entity3 and fired at least eight shots from an open window toward the @entity3			2
he used a @entity103 semi-automatic @entity101 rifle			0
he sped away but soon crashed his car , escaping on foot and fleeing aboard a freight train			0
he was arrested in @entity106 five days later			0
according to the @entity107 , @entity94 alleged the president was the " anti-christ " and claimed he was " on a mission from @entity110 to take out @entity14			2
" the @entity111 were outraged at the handling of the 2011 incident , the newspaper reported , and demanded to know why they were n't kept apprised of security details that affected their daughters			2
official : @entity6 twice interviewed , released would - be @entity3 intruder the paper said @entity85 spoke to the agency 's director at the time , @entity123 , in a voice loud enough to be heard through a closed door			1
after the 2011 shooting the @entity6 said implemented both personnel and structural enhancements following the review , and other physical and technical enhancements , including additional surveillance cameras			1
the @entity41 's report came at a trying time for the agency			1
in mid-september a man armed with a small knife made it over the @entity3 fence and into the @entity142 door , the first time in memory an intruder made it inside the executive mansion			0
he was stopped before making it farther into the president 's residence			0
after that incident , the agency said it was reviewing its officers ' response and bolstering security on @entity153 , where the intruder , @entity154 , jumped over the iron fence			2
the president , speaking after the september breach , said the agency does " a great job " in keeping his family safe .			0
