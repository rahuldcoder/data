-- @entity2 's reputation as rugby 's @entity4 team was reaffirmed on saturday as @entity7 's inconsistent side bounced back from two defeats to eliminate @entity9 and reach the @entity11 semifinals			1
@entity2 avenged their 2007 semi defeat by the @entity13 on home soil with a 19 - 12 victory in @entity16 , setting up a last - four clash with @entity18 -- who went through after beating @entity21 neighbors @entity22 22 - 10			1
with the other half of the drawing pitting hosts @entity25 against @entity26 , and world champions @entity28 versus @entity30 -- both games are on sunday -- there could potentially be a repeat of the inaugural 1987 final when the @entity25 beat @entity2			1
coach @entity7 will be replaced by @entity33 after the tournament , but he has the chance to help @entity2 to lift the @entity36 for the first time			1
his team lost to @entity25 and @entity39 in the group stage , but roared to a 16 - 0 halftime lead at @entity42 as wing @entity43 and fullback @entity45 crossed for tries , while @entity47 kicked two penalties			2
@entity9 , the 2003 champions , rallied with second - half tries to fullback @entity50 and wing @entity51 but a drop - goal by @entity54 in between those scores kept @entity2 safely ahead			1
" you ca n't give a good team like @entity2 16 points of a start			2
we had chances in the second half but they deserved to win , " said @entity9 manager @entity60 , a @entity11 winner as a player eight years ago			1
@entity2 captain @entity65 was glad to put the nightmare of the shock @entity39 defeat behind him			2
" we did n't want to go out like this			0
we wanted to show how we can play rugby , " he said			0
" i think we did it well			0
it was a great start for us and we are going to enjoy this victory			0
now we need to keep it up and focus on the next game			0
" the @entity77 will take on @entity18 at @entity42 next saturday after @entity79 's team handed @entity22 a first defeat of the tournament to reach the semifinals for the first time since 1987			1
the @entity85 runners - up scored three tries to one in @entity87 as @entity22 failed to capitalize on a wealth of first - half possession and crashed out at the last - eight stage for the fifth successive time			2
veteran winger @entity92 put @entity18 ahead with a third - minute try that young flyhalf @entity93 converted for a 10 - 3 lead at the break			1
@entity96 kicked @entity22 's only points with a 24th - minute penalty before @entity99 replied in kind just before the half hour			1
@entity22 leveled five minutes after the interval as @entity96 converted a try by wing @entity102 , but @entity18 scrum - half @entity104 dotted down in the 51st minute and center @entity107 made it safe on 64			1
" we spent a lot of time in that first half in their 22 and we only came up with three points in the half , " @entity22 captain @entity109 said			2
" it hurts a bit when you 're going in at halftime having the opportunities and knocking on the door , but not really getting any points out of the territory			0
" we needed to deliver a performance similar to the one against @entity30 or the one against @entity124 last week			0
we did n't do that today , we knocked on way too much ball			0
" @entity79 backed his young team to go further in the tournament			0
" they have no baggage and there 's no fear factor , " @entity79 said			0
" we are in @entity25 and not in the bubble of @entity18 and listening to any of the negativity that is sometimes generated back home			1
" we 've worked so hard in the last three , four months			0
we are n't ready to go home yet			0

@entity2 end @entity9 's @entity11 hopes with 19 - 12 win in *quarterfinals*
