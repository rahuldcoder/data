-- two days after a massive fertilizer plant explosion leveled parts of a central @entity5 town , killing 14 people and displacing many more , residents moved into recovery mode friday after investigators announced they had nearly finished search and rescue efforts			1
the fiery explosion ripped through the heart of @entity13 , a close - knit town about 75 miles south of @entity14 and about 20 miles north of @entity15			1
before wednesday , @entity13 was known as the home of @entity17 of the @entity18 and as the " @entity20 heritage capital of @entity5 , " boasting the best kolache in the state			1
" it 's going to be a long recovery for this community , " gov. @entity23 said			1
the death toll included the city secretary , who was also a member of the volunteer fire department , said mayor @entity30			1
the victim was the only person with the password to the city 's @entity34 account , @entity30 said , preventing others from posting updates about the incident			1
in total , five @entity13 firefighters died battling the blaze , along with one @entity14 firefighter and four emergency responders , the @entity40 's and @entity39 of @entity5 said thursday			1
i 've been a member of the firefighters for 26 years , " @entity30 said			1
" these guys are my friends			1
" the explosion tore through the roof of @entity51 , charring much of the structure and sending massive flames into the air			1
@entity30 rushed to the scene to assist in crowd control about 1.5 blocks from the plant			1
the explosion , which registered as a 2.1 - magnitude earthquake , blew his hat off , he said			2
it also destroyed his home , he said , making him one of many in the small town of 2,800 to be displaced in the blast 's aftermath			1
many , including him , are staying in hotels or with friends , he said			2
the destruction made it hard to account for exactly how many people had been displaced , @entity71 judge @entity70 said friday			2
he estimated that 99 % of people originally thought to be missing had been accounted for			2
@entity70 and @entity30 joined @entity23 in thanking volunteers from across the state who came to assist in cleanup			2
they also expressed gratitude for donations of food and clothes , but said they were running out of places to store them and asked that people instead donate money through the @entity89 and @entity90			2
" we 've hit the saturation point on receiving stuff , clothes , food , those kind of things , and we 're running out of places to put it , " @entity70 said			0
it 's still unclear what caused the blast , which @entity102 felt in his home 50 miles away			0
" we did n't know exactly what it was , " @entity102 said			0
" the forecast said a line of thunderstorms was going to come through			0
my wife and i looked up and wondered , ' did it get here six hours early ? ' " local authorities are still working with federal officials , including the @entity114 , to determine the cause of the deadly explosion , @entity23 said			0
it 's unclear whether the plant had safety problems			0
in 2006 , the @entity120 fined the company that ran the fertilizer plant $ 2,300 and told the owners to correct problems that included a failure to file a risk management program plan on time			0
seven years ago , the company had a complaint against it for a lingering smell of ammonia , the @entity129 website shows			0
the blast came as the nation remained on edge after the @entity137 on monday that killed three and left about 180 injured			0
it happened two days before friday 's 20th anniversary of a fire in @entity15 that ended a federal agents ' siege against members of the @entity145 sect			0
more than 80 sect members and some federal agents died			0
what 's clear , though , is the blast stunned residents of this town and left behind a trail of charred devastation			1
@entity23 surveyed the scene from a helicopter and on the ground			0
" we are blessed we did n't lose more people than we actually did , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
