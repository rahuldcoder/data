-- on wednesday , millions of @entity1 visiting their favorite websites will encounter the same dreaded image : the spinning wheel of death			2
this is the symbol of the great " @entity7 " -- a coordinated day of action among hundreds of organizers and some of the world 's largest tech firms , including @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19			1
together they are showing the @entity1 public what most of the internet would look like in a world without " net neutrality			2
" in a word : slow			0
these spinning wheels of death foreshadow a future that could be right around the corner			0
if the @entity34 adopts its proposed rules , @entity22 service providers like @entity32 or @entity33 will be allowed to provide " fast lanes " to websites and services that pay , and slow lanes to the rest			1
this means that it will be harder for @entity1 to access those sites that ca n't afford to pay fees -- including those of new businesses , nonprofits , educators , artists , activists , and faith groups			1
the result ? startup innovation , free expression , and democratic discourse in @entity1 will suffer			2
the good news is that it 's not too late to save the internet as we know it			0
the @entity34 is legally obligated to listen to the @entity1 people before adopting its rules			1
the deadline for submitting comments is september 15 , so this is our chance to speak up			0
there is much at stake			0
the @entity34 's proposed rules threaten our ability to access the applications , content , and services of our choice -- the very principle behind " net neutrality , " the idea that high - speed internet providers should treat all types of web content equally			1
net neutrality explained companies that provide gateways to the @entity22 should n't interfere with our ability to access what we want online , whether through blocking , discrimination , or giving better service to those who can pay			1
the @entity34 's current proposal would allow them to do just that			1
this means that we could encounter the spinning wheel of death on any site that ca n't afford to pay			2
" slow lanes " spell doom for innovation			1
on the @entity22 , the costs of innovation are incredibly low , and entrepreneurs do n't need massive upfront funding or permission to pursue their ideas			1
the proposed rules would change that			2
if established companies can pay so that their content loads faster or does not count against users ' monthly bandwidth caps , then that student working on a bright idea in a dorm room does n't have a chance to compete			1
many of today 's popular applications -- @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , or @entity116 -- were developed by innovators with little or no outside funding			0
in a world where such innovations are stuck in the slow lane , they would have never seen the light of day			0
innovation is n't the only thing that will suffer			0
today , the open @entity22 is also a space where all @entity1 , no matter the color of their skin or size of their wallets , have an equal opportunity to express themselves , organize politically , and connect with one another			1
under the new rules , it will be harder to hear those who ca n't pay -- educators , nonprofits , activists , writers , independent filmmakers and musicians			1
if internet service providers have the power to block , discriminate or charge access fees , we risk losing this critical space for democratic discourse , political action , and creative expression			0
according to @entity34 chairman @entity148 , the @entity34 does n't need to ban access fees to prevent this from happening			1
instead , the chairman proposes regulating the quality of internet service to make sure that the slow lane is not too slow			0
if the slow lane is good enough , he argues , those who ca n't pay can still get to their users and have a chance to compete			0
but it 's not the quality of the slow lane that is the problem ; it 's that there is a faster lane that provides a better experience			0
according to research , increasing load times by as little as 100 milliseconds reduces the amount of time people spend on a site , how much they buy , and whether they come back			0
thus , under the @entity34 's proposal , those who ca n't pay to be in the faster lane will have fewer users or readers , fewer sales , and less advertising revenue			1
this problem affects every application , website and service , not just delay - sensitive applications like online video			0
improving the quality of the slower lane does not remove that problem			0
we are still stuck with the quality differential between paying and nonpaying applications			0
so what should we do ? we should ask the @entity34 to throw out the current proposal and instead adopt strong rules that do not allow internet service providers to block or discriminate or charge access fees			1
in 2010 , the @entity34 adopted @entity189 that were n't perfect , but a step in the right direction			2
a federal court struck down those rules this year on a technicality : the @entity34 adopted them under the wrong authority			1
according to the court , a ban on access fees can only be imposed on entities that -- unlike @entity22 service providers -- have been classified as common carriers under @entity203 of the @entity204			1
the @entity34 needs to reclassify internet service providers as " common carriers " and enact the network neutrality rules we need under @entity203 of the @entity204			1
wednesday 's " @entity7 " is a glimpse into the future , but we have the power to avoid that fate			0
more than 1.2 million comments are already filed with the @entity34			2
people who care about the open @entity22 are calling on @entity216 and the @entity217 to stand with them			2
as long as the @entity22 is an open and equal space , we have a voice			2
let 's not squander the moment .			0

writer : some tech firms will *participate* in @entity22 *slowdown* wednesday to send message
if @entity34 lets net providers give " fast lanes " to sites that pay , innovation suffers , she says
such rules favor deep - *pocketed* established companies , not *scrappy* new ones , she says
writer : ask @entity34 to *reject* proposal , set rules that prevent providers from discriminating
