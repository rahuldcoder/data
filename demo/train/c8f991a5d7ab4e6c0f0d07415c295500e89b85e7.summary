-- @entity1 may be the center of attention this summer , but venture beyond the @entity6 and you 'll find the real @entity7 , a world of ancient thatched cottages , monumental castles , elegant university towns and jagged peaks			1
you wo n't have to travel far to see why the @entity7 landscape so inspired the romantic poets , why a-listers flee the city for tiny medieval villages and why a pint in a pub selling hammers and nails tastes finer than any other on @entity25			1
@entity26 : the @entity27 for a slice of picture - postcard @entity26 , the @entity27 make an easy excursion from @entity1 but feel half a world away			1
the wool trade boomed in these rolling hills in medieval times and today the region is littered with achingly pretty villages , elegant old mansions , graceful churches and atmospheric pubs , most largely unchanged for centuries			1
wander between rows of honey - colored almshouses and thatched cottages , browse the antiques shops or stop for a cream tea and you 'll feel transported back in time			1
away from the tourists in @entity49 and @entity50 you 'll find quieter spots such as @entity53 with its long curving high street			0
leading members of the arts and crafts movement were so enamored by the town they made it their home in the early 20th century , and their founder , @entity62 , settled in nearby @entity63 in a gloriously unassuming riverside mansion			0
another hidden gem , @entity66 , lies to the west with its elegant rows of medieval terraced housing and wonderful rococo gardens			1
for the best pint , head to the @entity73 in @entity74 , a place so special i barely wish to share it			0
@entity26 : @entity78 soaked in history and riddled with historic buildings , the university town of @entity78 exudes a dreamy air of @entity84 sophistication			1
the august colleges , hushed quadrangles , manicured lawns and cobbled laneways give way to " @entity90 , " a stretch of picturesque gardens bordering the meandering @entity93			1
@entity78 is an exclusive kind of place where gowned cyclists ply the streets and the academic elite debate life - changing questions in dimly lit pubs			1
you can visit many of the @entity103 's 31 colleges , but do n't miss the extraordinary @entity104			1
its mesmerizing fan - vaulted ceiling is best appreciated during @entity107 when you can listen to the college 's celebrated choir as you ponder your place in the universe			1
art lovers should follow up the grand neoclassical @entity114 with the unassuming @entity116 , a treasure trove of 20th - century art , ceramics and sculpture			1
for the quintessential @entity78 experience , hop on a chauffeur - driven punt to the sleepy village of @entity125			1
once a favorite haunt of the influential @entity128 of writers , intellectuals and artists , this is the place for afternoon tea at the tranquil @entity133			0
from @entity78 , it 's a short trip north to the charming town of @entity136 and its magnificent cathedral , whose soaring towers dominate the flat marshy fenland that surrounds the town			1
@entity26 : @entity142 @entity26 's largest protected outdoor playground , the @entity142 , is a wild and winsome place full of craggy peaks , glittering lakes and moody fells			2
for walkers and climbers , there 's a wealth of routes from which to choose			2
try the @entity153 , a chain of rugged hills offering spectacular views or for something less taxing , the @entity159 route			0
the region provided ample inspiration for some of @entity26 's finest writers and poets , and today you can follow the @entity167 trail from his childhood home in @entity169 to tiny @entity170 in @entity171 , and the more tranquil @entity172 in @entity173 , where you can sit in the house where he once tested his verse			2
@entity178 's bucolic 17th - century farmhouse , @entity179 , is also here and scenes straight from her books lie around every corner			1
many of the main sights get extremely busy , as do cruises on the largest lake , @entity188			0
instead head for @entity190 , where a trip on the restored 19th - century @entity192 offers captivating views of the surrounding hills and drops you off at @entity196 , the fascinating former home of @entity197 , @entity198 art critic , philosopher and philanthropist			2
@entity201 : the @entity202 and @entity203 big skies , craggy mountains , steely - gray lochs and cascading falls , the majestic , wild expanses of the @entity202 are every bit as romantic as their celluloid reputation			1
the grand vistas , lonesome castles and isolated pubs where you can warm yourself by a peat fire , sip a dram of whisky and put the world to right are all just waiting to be explored			2
you can hike , bike , ski and fish , feast on seafood , dance a jig or even toss a caber ( a large wooden pole thrown as a test of strength during the traditional @entity230 )			0
the mercurial landscape of the @entity232 makes an excellent place to start			0
sculpted by glaciers and home to golden eagles , wildcats and red deer , the ancient forests and bleak moorland here are simply spectacular			2
for pure romance , head to @entity243			0
perched on a rocky islet on the edge of @entity247 , it is one of @entity201 's most iconic sights			2
nearby is the glorious @entity250 or head for the @entity252 to marvel at the mysterious standing stones at @entity254 and dip your toes in the azure waters off @entity258 and @entity259			0
possibly @entity201 's most spectacular setting though is on far - flung @entity261 , where you 'll find the wonderfully preserved @entity263			1
the village , which predates the @entity266 pyramids , remains a testament to the ingenuity of the people of the day			0
@entity270 : @entity271 and @entity272 @entity272 is one of the country 's most spectacular and traditional regions			1
its high mountains and rough terrain deterred waves of invaders over the years , and its finest landscapes are protected as part of @entity271			2
@entity283 - capped mountains , tumbling rivers , @entity286 burial chambers and roman forts all lurk here			1
it 's an excellent spot for gentle hiking or challenging climbs but rather than tackle the busy @entity291 , head instead for @entity293 , a legendary peak said to be an entrance to the underworld			2
@entity297 makes a good base for walkers and climbers , but history buffs should head to one of the magnificent medieval castles that dot the area			0
the intimidating fortresses at @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 and @entity309 jointly form a @entity310 and are intriguing places to explore			0
alternatively , catch the dramatic @entity312 to the slate mines at @entity314 to learn about the human side of @entity270 ' industrial heritage			0
a short trip south and you enter an entirely different world at the whimsical @entity321 village of @entity322			0
set on a tranquil peninsula , this bizarre enclave was the brainchild of @entity270 architect sir @entity326			0
@entity327 : @entity328 gorgeously green and incredibly friendly , the lush scenery and unique atmosphere of @entity328 have made it one of @entity333 's most popular regions			1
here , emerald forests drip with moss , dramatic peaks lie shrouded in mist and water trickles everywhere			0
@entity339 out from the tourist honeypot of @entity341 around the @entity342 with its glorious views , sandy beaches and ancient ruins			0
it 's a busy route in summer and the best way to leave the crowds behind is to take a trip to the early @entity351 monastery of @entity352			2
seven miles offshore and up 600 steep steps , you 'll find the 6th - century beehive huts of what was once one of @entity359 's most remote religious communities			1
the sense of isolation here is humbling , and the views are nothing short of spectacular			0
alternatively , you could take a trip in a pony and trap across the beautiful gap of @entity369 which is flanked by @entity333 's highest mountains , the @entity372 's @entity371			1
whatever you do , do n't miss the @entity373 with its vast stretch of golden sand at @entity376 , scenic @entity377 and beguiling eponymous town where you can down a pint in the wonderfully atmospheric @entity381 's pub / hardware store			1
@entity333 : the @entity382 @entity333 's troubled reputation has been hard to shake off , but wander this way and you 'll be rewarded with the peace and tranquility of a place the world has yet to discover			1
beyond @entity392 's black taxi tours , urban regeneration and stunning new @entity395 experience , the biggest draw is the otherworldly @entity382			2
here , more than 38,000 interlocking basalt columns form a patchwork of stepping stones that stretch out into the sea			2
this extraordinary landscape marks the start of the legendary @entity403 's bridge to @entity201 , although a rival theory suggests it 's merely a geological phenomenon formed 50 million to 60 million years ago			0
from here the beautiful @entity382 stretches in both directions			0
@entity339 east to reach @entity407 , where a narrow swaying rope bridge connects the mainland to a little island traditionally known for its salmon fishing , or go west to the dramatic ruins of @entity413			0
perched on a clifftop , the fortress partly collapsed into the sea in 1639 and today a narrow bridge forges the gap between the main castle and its courtyard			0
alternatively , you could just hop on the historic train line to @entity423 , where you 'll find the world 's oldest legal distillery .			0

in the @entity27 , visit elegant mansions , graceful churches and atmospheric pubs
gowned cyclists ride the streets of @entity78 while academics debate
do n't skip the snow - capped mountains and @entity286 burial chambers of @entity272
do n't miss @entity333 's @entity373 with its vast stretch of golden sand
