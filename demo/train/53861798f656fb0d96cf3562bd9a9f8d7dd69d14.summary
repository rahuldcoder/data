along a pastoral lane at @entity3 's @entity2 estate sits a sizable wooden pen built specifically to house the two turkeys that will be " pardoned " at the @entity6 on wednesday			1
the well - appointed pen includes a small coop to protect them from weather and foxes , and an area for them to strut their stuff for camera - toting tourists			0
but there is one thing that is missing : other turkeys			2
that 's because all the turkeys ever pardoned at the @entity6 are dead , including the six already given a pass from the roasting pan by president @entity23 in previous years			1
@entity24 , king of the turkey brine ? " the bird is bred for the table , not for longevity , " said @entity26 , the director at @entity2 in charge of livestock			1
" some of [ the pardoned turkeys ] have been pretty short lived			2
" compared to domesticated animals , turkeys bred for consumption are usually plump and slaughtered after a period of months , and would n't be expected to live much longer on their own			1
so , a pardon really can extend their lives a lot , relatively speaking			0
the two turkeys pardoned in 2012 - @entity42 and @entity43 - died within a year of their @entity6 appearance , despite what a spokeswoman at @entity2 said was diligent veterinary care			1
@entity43 died on february 5 , 2013 , of natural causes			0
@entity42 lived a bit longer , dying on august 22 , 2013 , after he fell ill and had to be euthanized			0
both are buried at @entity2			2
in the two years prior , three of the four pardoned turkeys died less than five months after their pardon			1
the other turkey - peace , who was pardoned in 2011 - lived 16 months after arriving at @entity2			1
so why do those birds -- and others bred to be eaten -- die faster than their wild brethren ? " the birds are fed in such a way to increase their weight , " @entity26 , who has worked at @entity2 since 1969 , said			1
" [ @entity60 ] want a nice big breasted turkey and so they are fed high protein diet and they get quite large			1
the organs , though , that are in this bird are meant for a smaller bird			0
they just ca n't handle the extra weight , so they end up living not as long [ as wild turkeys ]			1
" the differences extend beyond life expectancy , too			0
" your native bird can fly beautifully and roost in trees , " @entity26 said , while the type that receive pardons " does not fly , has very short stubbly legs and typically last right up to @entity78			1
" how to defrost your turkey final years ? figuratively in 2012 , when @entity23 announced the pardons for @entity42 and @entity43 , he hinted the birds were in their final years , telling the audience that they were headed to @entity2 " where they will spend their twilight years in the storied home of @entity3			1
" the word " years , " however , seems to be an exaggeration			0
the @entity89 , a group that lobbies for the turkey industry and selects those to be honored each year at the @entity6 , disagrees with any notion that the lives of these birds are cut short			1
they are bred for consumption have a " life expectancy of about 18 weeks , " said @entity97 , spokesman for the turkey federation			2
" they are not raised as pets and animals are not pets			0
" their short lives , @entity97 points out , says more about @entity60 taste for turkey and breeding practices than mistreatment or short lives			1
@entity78 tips and recipes bred to be stuffed starting in 1960 , farmers specifically started breeding plump turkeys that had large amounts of white breast meat -- a response to @entity60 demand			1
the differences between wild and bred turkeys , @entity97 said , stems mostly from diet			2
" a turkey that is bred exclusively for eating , eats corn and soybean that have minerals in them , " @entity97 said			2
according to the federation , a whopping 219 million turkeys were consumed in the @entity60 in 2011			1
on @entity78 that year , the group estimates 46 million were gobbled up			1
since 1970 , around the time breeding practices changed , turkey consumption has increased 104 percent , according to the federation			0
the practice of pardoning a turkey at the @entity6 dates to @entity134			0
the story goes that around @entity78 , turkeys were brought to the @entity6 and @entity134 's son , @entity137 , grew attached to one particular bird and begged his chief executive father to spare the fowl from the table			2
@entity134 agreed and the turkey lived			0
it is unclear if the practice continued for the next 100 years			0
but in 1963 , president @entity145 decided to send his turkey back to the farm it came from , telling the @entity89 they should " just let this one grow " instead			2
@entity149 " 41 " sent them to @entity151 the tradition became official in 1989 , under president @entity149			0
on november 14 , weeks before @entity78 , @entity149 pardoned a turkey and the @entity6 shipped him off to live his twilight year at -- @entity151 -- in @entity154 , @entity155			1
since then , a president has pardoned a turkey each year			2
all of @entity23 's turkeys were sent to @entity2			1
the birds spent the holidays in the public pen and then were moved to a livestock area out of view because they were not " historically accurate " to @entity165 's time period			0
according to @entity26 , the turkey federation wanted the birds to be more prominently displayed			2
so this year , they will head to @entity168 , a historic estate in @entity169 , @entity155 , on january 7			0
the estate was home to former virginia gov. @entity172 , who ran it from 1918 to 1922			0
@entity172 was a prodigious turkey farmer , according to @entity175 , a spokeswoman for @entity168			0
as for the near certainty that the turkeys will soon die , @entity175 said they " are going to do everything [ they ] can to make that not happen			0
" " these turkeys were raised in @entity182 , so they are used to cold winters , " @entity175 said			0
" a lot of the employees here are already on turkey duty			0

each year , an @entity60 president " pardons " a turkey or two just before @entity78
president @entity23 has sent his turkeys to @entity194 . @entity2 for their " twilight years "
but a pardon just means the birds are n't stuffed and eaten ; they *'re* not expected to live long
@entity60 turkeys are bred to be consumed , many of them at @entity78
