-- move over , @entity1			2
it looks like @entity3 is the real thing			0
the tech giant has ended @entity1 's 13 - year run as the world 's most valuable brand on a highly regarded annual list			1
and the rivalry between @entity3 and @entity11 has apparently been good to both			1
bolstered by the dominance of its android operating system , @entity11 also leapfrogged @entity1 , moving into second place on @entity19 's yearly @entity18 list			1
they headed a tech - heavy list , on which @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 helped round out the top 10			1
but @entity3 shone brightest , as much for its role as a cultural institution as for the products themselves			0
" every so often , a company changes our lives , not just with its products , but with its ethos , " @entity19 ceo @entity31 said in the report			0
" this is why , following @entity1 's 13 - year run at the top of @entity18 , @entity19 has a new no. 1 -- @entity3			1
" @entity19 , which consults with companies about their public image , compiles its list based on financial performance of the company , the role the brand plays in influencing consumers , and how secure the brand 's top money - making products are in their field			1
according to the report , @entity3 's brand is estimated to be worth $ 98.3 billion , a 28 % increase over 2012 , when it was no. 2 on the list			2
@entity1 's value also rose , but by only 2 % , to $ 79.2 billion			0
much of @entity3 's boost can probably be attributed to its growing presence in @entity61 , where iphones and other @entity3 devices are increasingly popular			0
@entity3 and @entity11 were just two of many tech companies among the list 's fastest - rising brands			1
@entity68 gained 43 % to hit no. 52 , making it the only social - media site on the list			2
@entity71 jumped 27 % to no. 19			0
last year @entity11 was fourth on the list			2
" tech brands continue to dominate @entity19 's @entity18 report -- underscoring the fundamental and invaluable role they play in consumers ' lives , " the report reads			1
the report estimates that the list 's tech companies have a combined value of more than $ 443 billion			0
last year @entity3 eclipsed @entity22 to become the most valuable public company in history , although its stock has since dipped			1
this year , @entity3 was surpassed by @entity23 in the total number of smartphones sold worldwide , and some in the tech community knocked the company for what they perceived as a lack of innovation compared to its competitors			1
but the newly released @entity94 sold a record 9 million units during its first weekend , far outdistancing the 5 million or so @entity97 handsets sold in the same amount of time last year			0
( it 's worth noting , though , that @entity61 was part of the initial rollout of the @entity94 but was n't for the 5			0
) @entity19 says its not worried about @entity3 on the innovation front			2
" ( ceo ) @entity105 has assembled a solid leadership team and has kept @entity109 ' vision intact -- a vision that has allowed @entity3 to deliver on its promise of innovation time and time again , " @entity31 said .			0
