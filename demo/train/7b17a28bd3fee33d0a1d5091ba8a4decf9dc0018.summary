with her hijab , @entity0 may have stood out			2
but in every respect , she felt that she fit in -- as a proud , and blessed , @entity4			1
even if most of her @entity6 neighbors did n't wear the same @entity8 head covering that she did , @entity9 believed that there were " still so many ways that i feel ... embedded in the fabric that is our culture , " meaning the @entity4 culture			1
" that 's the beautiful thing here , is it does n't matter where you come from , " she said last summer as part of @entity19 's @entity18 project			1
" there are so many different people from so many different places , ... backgrounds and religions			2
but here we 're all one			1
" it 's beautiful to see			1
people of different areas interacting and being family , one community			2
" @entity9 's light , her idealism , was extinguished tuesday with gunshots that killed not only her , but her 23 - year - old husband , @entity41 , and 19 - year - old sister , @entity42			1
all three were shot in the head			2
a neighbor of the victims , @entity44 , 46 , turned himself in to police the same night and has been charged with murder			0
authorities have n't announced any motive , but @entity9 's father thinks he knows			1
his daughters and son - in - law died , @entity52 said , because they were @entity8			0
if so , that constitutes a hate crime			0
the @entity4 @entity55 issued a statement friday afternoon that said the department 's @entity57 , along with the the @entity59 for the @entity60 of @entity6 and the @entity61 , have opened " a parallel preliminary inquiry " to determine whether any federal laws , including hate crime laws , were violated			1
president @entity65 mentioned the @entity61 inquiry in his friday afternoon statement about the " brutal and outrageous murders " in the college town of @entity70			1
" no one in the @entity4 should ever be targeted because of who they are , what they look like , or how they worship , " he said			1
" @entity77 and i offer our condolences to the victims ' loved ones			0
as we saw with the overwhelming presence at the funeral of these @entity85 , we are all one @entity4 family			1
" investigators indicated they have n't found any signs of a hate crime so far , saying the evidence suggests the shootings stem from a parking dispute			0
but 150 @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and other civil rights and faith groups want a closer look			0
in a letter to attorney general @entity105 , they said there is enough circumstantial evidence to " warrant a federal hate crime investigation , " an inquiry they say is important to the victims ' families and @entity8 across the @entity4			1
" federal leadership is necessary in this case in order to send the strongest message to the public that acts of violence like these have no place in civil society and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law , " the groups write			0
" ... as @entity4 @entity8 and those perceived to be @entity8 now , more than ever , fear for their safety , the @entity4 people need to hear a strong message from our nation 's chief law enforcement officer			1
" they are n't the only ones demanding action out of @entity134			0
@entity135 , @entity41 's sister , said friday on @entity2 's " the lead with @entity137 " that a disagreement over parking did n't spark the killings , because her family members knew to avoid the " disputed " parking spot			1
her family members were targeted because they were @entity8 , @entity135 said , adding that @entity44 terrorized her family and the slayings should be considered an act of terrorism			1
" it 's time people call it what it is , " she said			1
the story has gotten traction internationally			0
@entity154 , an @entity156 center of @entity94 scholarship , has called the killings a " terrorist cowardly act " rooted in " racism and @entity161			2
" @entity163 president @entity162 said he has called @entity65 , vice president @entity164 and secretary of state @entity165			1
before @entity65 made his statement , @entity162 said , " president @entity65 , mr. @entity165 , ( vice president ) @entity164 , at this point have not made any declaration of respect			1
... and if you stay silent when faced with an incident like this and do n't make a statement , the world will stay silent towards you			0
" many of the victims ' friends and relatives gathered thursday for their funerals and for candlelight vigils on college campuses such as @entity184 in @entity185 , which is where @entity41 met his future wife , and where she and her sister went to school			1
" these three people , as young as they were , were a source of inspiration , warmth and light for our community , " said one woman speaking at the vigil			0
that 's how @entity199 knew them			2
they were n't just @entity8 , she said of her friends , but " three good people			0
" " no one should die like that , " @entity204 told @entity2 's " @entity207 , " " especially when you 're that great			1
" @entity52 , father of the two slain women , said the problems started not when @entity41 lived in the condo by himself , but when his new wife , @entity9 , moved in			1
he said his daughter told him , referring to the neighbor , " @entity215 , i think he hates us for who we are and how we look			0
" @entity9 's good friend , @entity218 , agreed that something does n't add up			2
she recalled one time @entity9 told her about the neighbor coming over with a gun to complain about noise after a few friends had gone over to play a board game			0
" we were completely shocked because it 's not normal for you to have a disagreement of some sort with your neighbor and for you to go over there with a gun , " @entity226 said			2
when the news came out about the slayings , that neighbor jumped to mind			0
@entity226 said " the only thing that really makes sense is that he did n't like them because they were different			0
" " if he went and maybe killed all the neighbors , maybe then we can be like , ' oh , he has an issue , ' " she said			0
" they were our friends , and we feel like they were targeted for a reason			0
" police said @entity44 has no prior criminal record and is cooperating with the investigation			0
@entity252 , the lawyer for @entity44 ' wife , @entity253 , said the shooting " highlights the importance of access to mental health care services			0
" @entity258 , who has been in the process of divorce , said her husband had been at odds with various neighbors of various backgrounds over parking			0
that 's what this is about , she said , contending that what happened is not a hate crime			2
she said , " i can say with my absolute belief that this incident had nothing to do with religion or the victims ' faith			0
" opinion : 3 slain college students strived for a better world @entity2 's @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 contributed to this report .			2
