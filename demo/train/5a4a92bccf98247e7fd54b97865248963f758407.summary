-- a person infected with an active case of tuberculosis flew aboard a commercial passenger jet last week , despite the person 's presence on a " do - not - board " list maintained by federal health authorities , officials said tuesday			1
the patient , who has not been identified publicly , flew saturday aboard @entity13 from @entity14 , @entity15 , to @entity16 , @entity17 , airline spokesman @entity11 told @entity0			1
an investigation involving @entity13 , the @entity19 ( @entity20 ) and the @entity21 is under way , he said			1
the @entity21 gives the do - not - board list to the @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , which notifies @entity20			1
it in turn notifies the individual airlines , according to a @entity30 government official who asked not to be identified			2
in this case , the official said , the government notified the airline at 10 p.m. friday , more than 14 hours before the passenger checked in for the flight , which departed at noon saturday			1
" when @entity25 was provided the do - not - board information from @entity21 , @entity20 quickly followed proper protocol and made this information available to airlines , " @entity20 spokeswoman @entity37 told @entity0			1
the @entity21 told @entity42 that there is little to no risk that another passenger would contract the disease on a flight of fewer than eight hours , @entity11 said			1
because the flight lasted less than six hours , the airline has not tried to contact any of the other passengers , he said			0
the person was stopped in @entity16 after trying to board another flight for a location outside the country , said dr. @entity55 , @entity21 's director for global migration and quarantine			1
" we do n't think anyone with active tuberculosis should get on a plane , " he told @entity0 in a telephone interview			0
@entity55 said the patient has a contagious form of tuberculosis but he would not divulge whether it is a multiple - drug - resistant strain of the bacteria , which can prove fatal			0
the patient is being treated for the disease , the doctor said			2
despite the fact that the person boarded the @entity14 - @entity16 leg of his planned trip , " i think the public health side of this equation functioned , " @entity55 said			1
he noted that the person 's name was put on a do - not - board list in a timely way and that the person was intercepted in @entity16			1
still , he acknowledged , it could have gone better			0
" if everything is working smoothly , the hope is that he would never get onto the flight in @entity14 , " he said			2
it is not the first time the list has failed to keep a passenger with contagious tuberculosis off a jetliner in the roughly 30 months of its existence , he said			2
" there are a few others , but it 's exceedingly uncommon , " he said , citing " a handful of other incidents			0
" he added , " every time it does n't work , it 's unfortunate and it 's investigated ... there are all sorts of reasons why things may not work exactly as planned			0
" the list was created in june 2007 after @entity113 , @entity112 , lawyer @entity110 traveled abroad with a drug - resistant case of tuberculosis			2
he set off an international health scare by flying to @entity118			0
and then @entity119 , before driving back to the @entity30			0
he insisted he had not been told he was contagious ; public health officials disagreed			0
since its creation , the list has held 88 names of people with contagious disease who represent a threat to public health and have shown evidence of intending to fly , @entity55 told @entity0			2
seventy - six of the names have been removed , he said			0
he underscored that the do - not - board list differs from the do - not - fly list maintained by the @entity25			1
" there are separate procedures and processes , " he said			0
@entity136 , one of nine diseases that can get a person on the list , has accounted for most of the cases on the list			1
other diseases include viral hemorrhagic fever and @entity144 .			0

person with active case of @entity136 was on federal " do not board " list
patient was on @entity13 from @entity14 to @entity16
patient , not publicly identified , was stopped from leaving country in @entity17
@entity21 : little to no risk that another passenger would contract the disease on this flight
