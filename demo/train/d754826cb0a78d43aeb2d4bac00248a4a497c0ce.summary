scoop up some soil on @entity1 , heat it up , cool down the steam and ... slurp , slurp ! you 've got water ! @entity1 might appear dry as a desert , but astronauts may someday be able to tap its soil to quench their thirst			1
research recently published suggests that the soil from the @entity1 surface contains about 2 % water by weight			1
this is one of several insights emerging from data that the @entity1 rover curiosity has been collecting			2
five studies in the journal @entity21 were published last week based on data from the rover 's first 100 days on the @entity1			2
" the community was surprised that there was a large amount of water trapped in the ... martian soil , " said @entity28 , manager of @entity30 's @entity29			1
curiosity , representing a $ 2.5 billion @entity30 mission , has been on @entity1 since it made a dramatic landing there august 6 , 2012			2
earthlings celebrated as the two - ton rover arrived , carrying with it the most sophisticated suite of instruments and cameras to explore the surface of another planet			2
thanks to @entity32 , scientists now know more than ever about the composition of the @entity1 soil			1
" it 's the first time that the soil has been analyzed at this level of accuracy , " @entity28 said			1
turning on the faucet the rover 's @entity51 at @entity1 ( @entity54 ) instrument helped scientists probe the soil by heating a sample up to 835 degrees @entity58			1
the gases that came off included oxygen and chlorine as well as water vapor			1
based on the ratio of isotopes within , scientists believe this water is coming from the recent @entity1 atmosphere			1
" if you take about a cubic foot of dirt with the amount of water that we found and heated it up , you could get a couple of pints of water out of that , " said @entity68 , dean of science at @entity70 in @entity71 , who led this study			1
" it was kind of exciting to me to see that , wow , it would be a significant amount			2
" more broadly , the analysis gives us new information about the hydrological cycle on @entity1 , said @entity92 , lead scientist on the @entity32 mission			1
" somehow , there 's a process on @entity1 where , even though there are just trace quantities of water in @entity1 's atmosphere , this noncrystalline material is able to absorb it like a sponge and bind it into its framework , " @entity92 said			1
the technical details about how future astronauts would use the soil as a resource for water have n't been worked out , @entity28 said			1
a condenser would be required to cool the water steam into a liquid form after heating up the soil			1
but from what we know so far , he said , it would be drinkable			0
" this is a reservoir for water on @entity1 that we had not really appreciated before , " @entity92 said			1
more than 100,000 want to go to @entity1 and not return soil types scientists are also learning about the diversity of the soil on @entity1			1
@entity125 - @entity124 , a scientist at @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 , and colleagues used data from an instrument that fires a laser to analyze the soil and rock on @entity1			1
it 's called the @entity137			0
one main soil type on @entity1 , they said , is made of fine - grained particles and carries a significant amount of hydrogen			1
scientists say this reflects the dust that covers the whole @entity1 surface			1
the dust that covers @entity1 is more akin to a fine sand than the fluffy film on the floors of neglected attics on @entity151 , @entity28 said			0
the other main soil type was coarse and is local to @entity153 , the area where the rover is exploring			1
these particles , up to 1 millimeter in size , reflects what rocks in this area are made of			0
previous rovers -- @entity161 -- had less sophisticated technology to analyze soil but their insights about the mineral composition of the @entity1 soil are similar to what @entity32 found , @entity124 said			1
with @entity137 and @entity32 's other instruments , the latest rover can give scientists a deeper understanding of the composition , as well as how this soil was formed			1
complications with organics new scientific insights also present the issue of chemical compounds that may complicate the search for life on @entity1			0
curiosity is not capable of detecting life directly ; it would n't confirm either modern life or ancient fossil organisms			0
it can , however , determine if the ancient environment was habitable -- which the rover told us it was -- and look for organic compounds			0
finding those compounds would n't prove the existence of life , either , because they can come from other sources			0
but the appearance of organic molecules would suggest that the environment is good at preserving them			0
the release of chlorine and oxygen when the rover heated up soil suggests the presence of a chemical called perchlorate , at a 0.5 % level in the soil , @entity68 said			1
this substance can destroy organic carbon in a chemical reaction when the rover heats up soil			1
and so far , @entity32 has not directly detected organics in the soil			1
potentially the rover could avoid this problem using alternative techniques , which would n't heat the soil so much that perchlorates break down			2
" perchlorate is reacting with some organic compound to produce these simple molecules , " @entity92 said			0
" it leaves us asking the question : is this from @entity1 , or is it something we brought with us ? and right now we do n't know			0
" perchlorate in the planet 's abundant dust could present a toxicity problem to humans on @entity1 ; on @entity151 , it 's known to cause thyroid problems , @entity68 said			0
the dust could generally pose a health problem as well -- both physically interfering with respiration and being a chemical hazard			0
@entity1 is known to have massive dust storms			0
" it 's one of the significant concerns to human exploration , " @entity28 said			0
still no methane scientists are interested in whether @entity1 has methane gas , which could be an indicator of the planet 's habitability			2
about 90 % to 95 % of the methane in @entity151 's atmosphere is biologically derived , said @entity252 , a @entity253 researcher and co-investigator for @entity54 , said in november 2012			0
but the rover still has not detected methane gas , as scientists noted in @entity21 earlier in september			2
even if there were methane , nonbiological sources such as volcanic activity can produce it			0
it 's still possible that methane will turn up in future measurements , however , @entity28 said			0
studies : martian atmosphere was destroyed long ago where it 's going now curiosity is about one - fifth of the way to @entity271 , its final destination , where it will climb while testing the peak 's sedimentary layers that have formed over time			0
@entity271 is 3.4 miles high , and its rock layers represent a series of chapters of the planet 's history and the environmental conditions present in various eras			0
along the way , the rover stopped at a location called @entity284 1 , where scientists found a conglomerate rock that would have been found in an ancient stream bed			2
the rock with the pebbles has strange veins , filled with material that scientists do n't quite understand			2
" the implication of that is that again we 're seeing the involvement of water , and it looks like this water was very widespread across the landing area , " @entity92 said			2
it appears that the river would have extended from the rover 's landing site all the way to @entity284 1			0
the entire area that @entity32 has been driving across would have been covered by a stream bed , at one point or another , in the ancient history of @entity1			1
curiosity is n't the only moving human - made object on @entity1			0
the opportunity rover , which launched in 2004 , is still chugging along			0
in 2020 , @entity30 plans to send an even more advanced rover to " explore and assess @entity1 as a potential habitat for life , search for signs of past life , collect carefully selected samples for possible future return to @entity151 , and demonstrate technology for future human exploration of the @entity1			0
" @entity30 recently announced a competition for proposals of what instruments the 2020 rover could carry			0
it , too , may get humans closer to drinking water , and possibly even showering , on @entity1			2

@entity32 heated up soil to get water vapor
astronauts may some day be able to use this as a water source
scientists have *identified* two main soil types in @entity153
