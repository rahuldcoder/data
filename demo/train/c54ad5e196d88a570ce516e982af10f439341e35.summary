exactly what led to the surge remains unclear			0
but some believe the beefed up military presence is part of a power struggle between second - term prime minister @entity35 and newly elected president @entity36			0
" you 've got @entity35 refusing to step down			0
now he 's mobilized not just security troops loyal to him , but now he 's mobilized army units to put tanks in the streets , " said retired lt. col. @entity38 , a @entity39 military analyst			2
" some of the bridges have been closed			0
it looks like he 's trying to lock down the city in some sort of confrontation with the president , so this does not portend well			0
" choosing a prime minister is a key next step for @entity13 's leaders			1
critics of @entity35 have called for him to pull his name out of the running , but he 's repeatedly refused			0
@entity35 has accused @entity36 of violating the country 's constitution by extending the deadline for @entity13 's biggest political coalitions to nominate a candidate for prime minister			1
but there could be another reason for more troops in the capital			0
retired @entity69 gen. @entity68 said the stepped up security could be a response to advances by militants from @entity74 , the @entity75 extremist group that has now declared itself the @entity76			2
" it could be a show of force			0
if you 're talking about protecting government buildings , there may be a sense that @entity74 forces may be closer than everybody thinks at this point , " @entity68 said			1
" that could be a great sign for concern			0
but it may also be a concern that there 's a coup afoot			0

humanitarian nightmare in their effort to create a caliphate across parts of @entity13 and @entity2 , @entity74 fighters have slaughtered civilians as they take over cities in both countries			1
in @entity2 , the group put some of its victims ' severed heads on poles			2

they force the man at gunpoint to " convert " to @entity141 , then behead him			0
in @entity13 , one of the most dire humanitarian nightmares is unfolding on @entity108 , where tens of thousands of @entity144 have been trapped			1

the ministry had also heard reports -- but had not confirmed -- that some had been buried alive			0
who are the @entity144 ? why does @entity74 want to kill them ? " it 's difficult to be accurate about these numbers , but initially we have reported 500 @entity13 yazidis have died from either @entity74 direct killings or from starvation and dehydration , " @entity163 told @entity39			1
" we have heard some reports from activists and local journalists that some families were buried alive			0
