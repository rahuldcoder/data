-- imagine the entire population of @entity2 forced out of their homes in the past 25 years , with many of the residents moving to a neighboring country			1
displaced children at a camp in @entity10 , @entity11 , earlier this year			1
that 's what has happened in @entity11 , a country of 45 million where up to 4 million people -- roughly the population of @entity2 -- have been forced to flee fighting between government forces and an entrenched @entity20 rebel group			1
so many @entity11 have taken flight to escape violence that the nation has the second largest number of internally displaced people in the world -- surpassed only by @entity27 in @entity28			1
oftentimes , the violence is not incidental			2
" violence against civilians is a strategy of war for all the parties involved in the warfare , " said @entity29 , who worked for relief agencies in @entity11 for 15 years			1
" that 's the problem			2
they do it on purpose			0
they use it as a strategy			2
" exact figures are hard to come by			0
reliefweb , a @entity46 web site that provides information to humanitarian relief organizations , says nearly 400,000 @entity11 were displaced last year			1
the @entity11 government puts the number of displaced at 255,000 for 2008			1
likewise , the @entity11 government says nearly 3 million citizens have been displaced inside the country in the past few decades			1
but the non-governmental @entity53 , known in @entity11 as @entity55 , estimates more than 4 million people have had to leave their homes since the 1980s			1
@entity58 , a political analyst with the @entity60 consulting firm , says about 200,000 @entity11 have ended up in @entity61 , which has granted 5,500 residency permits in the past eight weeks			1
at the heart of the violence lies a guerrilla war with the @entity11 government and paramilitary groups on one side and the @entity69 , which is the @entity71 acronym for @entity69 , on the other			1
the @entity69 has been waging war against the government since the 1960s and has major strongholds in the jungles of southwest @entity11 , near the 366 - mile ( 590 - kilometer ) border with @entity61			1
@entity79 also have strongholds in the area and are often allied with the @entity69 , who provide security and intelligence			0
many times the rebels and the narcotraffickers are one and the same			2
the guerrillas use drug money to buy weapons			0
" there are large parts of @entity11 where the state has no presence , no police , no army , nothing , " said @entity92 , the @entity93 ambassador to @entity11 from 1994 to 1997			1
" that 's where the narcotraffickers hang out			2
" that makes it valuable territory for the guerrillas and narcos , said @entity29 , executive director of the @entity110 office in @entity111 , @entity112			0
" they 're more willing to fight over land that is strategic , " she said			0
" you 've poured gasoline on the fire with that			2
" as the army , paramilitaries and the guerrillas fight for territory -- often retaking land one side or the other had held before -- the civilian population gets caught in the middle			2
when one side comes in , @entity29 said , everyone living in the area is suspected of having collaborated with the enemy			0
that sometimes leads to massacres , or at least kidnappings and death threats			2
" the majority of displacements in @entity11 are not because of combat , but because people are directly threatened , " said @entity138 , spokesman in @entity11 for the @entity46 high commissioner for refugees			1
" they are told , ' leave or be killed			0
' " many times , indigenous populations in far - flung places suffer the most			0
that 's what happened earlier this year to the @entity148 tribe in southwest @entity11			1
the @entity69 admitted in an internet statement that guerrillas " executed " eight people february 6 in the town of @entity153 because the rebels believed the @entity155 were gathering information to give to the @entity11 military			1
the @entity158 organization said the guerrillas tortured some of the @entity148 before killing them with knives			2
@entity161 of the @entity162 said the @entity69 had targeted the @entity148 because the @entity155 do n't want to get involved in the armed struggle and refuse to reveal information on government troop actions			2
he said the @entity69 had abducted @entity148 in february and killed 44			0
" we are very worried about the @entity148 community , " said monsignor @entity166 , the bishop of the city of @entity168			0
" it is a community that is pretty unprotected and that in the past five years has received a type of persecution by armed groups			0
" the @entity11 government has issued a " risk report " warning that civilians in the region are in danger , and the @entity46 high commissioner for refugees proclaimed an alert this week about threats against human rights workers			1
a @entity46 report notes that displacement disproportionately affects @entity11 's poorest citizens , and their lives get worse after they are forced to flee			1
one of every two displaced @entity11 is unemployed and a similar number live in makeshift homes made of cloth , cardboard or wood , says the @entity193 of the @entity46 high commissioner for refugees			1
more than three - fourths of children who leave school after being displaced never return			0
then there 's the issue of forced conscription			2
according to reliefweb , between 12,000 and 14,000 minors have been forced to join armed groups			0
@entity138 , the @entity46 spokesman in @entity11 , notes that displaced residents have lost about 15 million acres ( 6 million hectares )			1
that 's an area about the size of @entity207			2
" you have displaced people living in hunger in the cities of @entity11 while they still have property , " @entity138 said			1
displacement occurs when people move within a country			2
when they leave the country , they become refugees			0
the problem occurs among all segments of @entity11 society			1
the political class is often hit hard			0
@entity223 was among 12 regional lawmakers the @entity69 kidnapped on april 11 , 2002 , in @entity225 , @entity11 's third - largest city			1
the rebels killed him and 10 others on june 18 , 2007 , when a @entity11 army patrol came upon the camp in which the hostages were being held			1
when the bodies were recovered three months later , autopsies showed most had been shot several times in the back			0
@entity223 's son , also named @entity223 , was a doctor in @entity225 at the time			0
" we buried him and the next day we left the country , " he said			0
he , his wife and younger sister first went to @entity61 , where they lived for two months before securing passage to @entity111 , where he works as a neurological researcher for the @entity245			1
his mother stayed behind but visits often , especially after the birth of her granddaughter , @entity248 , four months ago			0
@entity223 , 28 , has been in the @entity93 for 16 months but still harbors hopes to return			0
" of course , " he said			0
" it is a very good country			0
i believe there will be a solution			0
once there is , i will go back			0
" @entity111 resident @entity254 , 25 , tells a similar story			0
her father was a politician in @entity257 , in southwest @entity11 about 17 miles east of @entity225			1
he started receiving threats and some colleagues were kidnapped			0
they first moved around inside @entity11 , living in three cities over a two - year period			1
she , her parents and a younger sister then lived in @entity266 for five years before moving to @entity111 two years ago , the soft - spoken @entity263 said			0
" there is always fear when someone makes threats , " she said			0
she , too , holds expectations of returning some day			0
" we will wait for the right time and for all that to end , " @entity263 said			0
many refugees end up in @entity61 because it 's the nearest country to the killing fields of southwestern @entity11			1
some are forced there by the fighting			0
" over the course of the past five years , the @entity69 has been pushed back into @entity11 's less densely populated jungle regions and across the @entity61 border , " said @entity282 , an analyst with the @entity284 consulting firm			1
" more and more citizens in southern @entity11 have been forced out and had nowhere else to go but @entity61			1
" @entity29 , the aid agency official , has noticed the same phenomena			0
" the @entity11 go across where the violence pushes them that way , " she said			1
" often , that 's the only direction they can go			0
" @entity61 has started incorporating the displaced @entity11 , giving residency status to 5,500 in the past few weeks			1
that may seem surprising , given the poor standing between the countries			0
@entity61 broke diplomatic relations with @entity11 in march 2008 and amassed troops along the border after a @entity11 military attack against a @entity69 camp inside @entity61			1
the attack killed 25 people , including rebel leader @entity303 , four @entity304 and an @entity61			1
no country in the area is afraid of @entity61 , says @entity92 , the former @entity93 ambassador			1
" @entity61 is a very weak state			1
it 's lost 60 percent of its territory since its independence ( in 1822 ) , " he said			0
" @entity61 is a little guy who gets pushed around by everybody			2
" @entity61 president @entity314 used the tension to forge national unity when he successfully ran for re-election in april 2009 , said @entity58			2
" it was more convenient for president @entity314 to be an enemy of @entity11 than a friend of @entity11 , " @entity58 said			2
" now both sides have been trying to find common points to restore diplomatic relationships , " @entity282 said			0
the issue of residency visas , he said , " is one such point			0
" @entity61 also may have felt the need to do something about the @entity69			2
" @entity61 are also under a lot of pressure since allegations that the @entity69 was coming across the border and @entity61 has been looking the other way , " said @entity282			2
" @entity61 is under pressure to register all @entity11 immigrants coming in to prevent @entity11 rebels from coming into @entity61 unregistered and unnoticed			1

@entity11 civilians caught in cross fire between rebels , government forces
" violence against civilians is a strategy of war , " relief worker says
many civilians flee homes as a result of direct threats
@entity61 is country closest to @entity11 's killing fields , many flee there
