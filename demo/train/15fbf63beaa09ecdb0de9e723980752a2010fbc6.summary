-- a former manager for the private contractor that provides guards for the @entity4 in @entity5 said he tried to blow the whistle more than a year ago about inadequate staffing and improper behavior by guards , including going to brothels and sex trafficking			1
images released by a watchdog group show raucous partying and sexual hazing by private embassy guards			2
@entity17 filed a lawsuit in @entity19 thursday claiming he was forced from his job illegally in february 2008 by @entity21 , @entity22 ( @entity23 ) -- a security contractor owned by @entity24 @entity17 said he asked the company and the @entity26 in investigate activities in @entity28 by the company 's guards , but there was no follow - up investigation			1
@entity17 's suit , which seeks back pay and unspecified punitive damages , follows separate reports last week by a watchdog group that the contractor allowed mistreatment , sexual activity and intimidation within the ranks of private guards hired to protect the @entity4 in @entity5			1
a spokeswoman for @entity24 at its @entity46 headquarters released a statement saying @entity17 had resigned voluntarily and that his departure was not tied to whistleblowing nor was there retaliation by the company			2
" we found that mr. @entity17 's factual allegations and legal claims were overstated , ill - founded , not based on any personal knowledge , or otherwise lacking in legal merit			2
we chose not to accede to the demands of mr. @entity17 and his lawyers and instead to let them present their case in court if they chose to do so , " the @entity24 statement said			0
@entity17 spoke to a @entity64 news conference by telephone thursday , saying he is working for another security firm in @entity28 but declining to give any further details			1
explaining his lawsuit , @entity17 said , " i set out two years ago to see to it that the @entity4 in @entity28 was protected			1
i am hoping that the public airing of this lawsuit will bring us closer to that goal			0
" last week a watchdog group , the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , released photographs showing raucous partying and sexual hazing by private embassy guards			2
@entity74 sent a letter to secretary of state @entity80 and briefed reporters on its findings , which it said were based on e-mails and interviews with more than a dozen guards who have worked at the @entity87 compound in @entity28			2
in the wake of @entity74 's actions , the @entity26 said the behavior shown in the photos was " disgusting " and launched several investigations and said it had removed some of the private guards from the country			1
meanwhile the same company continues to guard the @entity87 embassy , a contract worth more than $ 180 million a year			2
@entity26 spokesman @entity100 said in his daily briefing in @entity64 that the department had " aggressively overseen " the contract for embassy guards and had issued nine so - called " cure notices " to correct specific deficiencies since the contract began in 2007			2
" at no time was the security of the embassy ever threatened or compromised , " @entity100 said			0
but @entity17 called the assertion " ludicrous			0
" " if you hire a guard force that is placing you at risk because of their behavior , and is also inadequate with regard to the fact of language difficulty between elements of the guard force , i do n't see how anyone can say the government is getting what they are paying for and it does n't compromise the integrity of the embassy itself , " @entity17 said , referring to reports that some of the private guards hired by the contractor were @entity115 - speaking gurkhas from @entity116			1
" if the guards ca n't communicate with each other , how are they going to communicate in a disaster ? how are you going be able to properly respond to a scenario if you have to use pantomime to properly convey a message to a member of the security force ? it is ludicrous for anyone to say that is a safe environment and an effective security force , " @entity17 said			0
@entity100 said @entity26 officials had interviewed more than 150 guards since pictures were released last week by the watchdog group , and that a total of 16 people had been kicked out of the country			0
but @entity100 would not comment on the new claims that private guards had patronized brothels and allegedly been involved in sex trafficking , with @entity100 saying he would not discuss any matters that might be under litigation			1
in his lawsuit @entity17 said one employee " had to be forcibly removed from a brothel in @entity28 during working hours			0
" @entity17 said he tried to have that person dismissed but found other @entity21 personnel , including " the @entity23 medic and the program manager himself had frequented the brothels with him			1
" " on the heels of this incident i learned that there had been an outbreak of sexually transmitted disease among @entity23 guards in 2007 that had never been reported as required to the @entity26 , and that the guard force routinely frequented brothels , " @entity17 said thursday			1
@entity17 said the company resisted " with outright hostility " his efforts as a manager to impose a no - brothel policy			0
and @entity17 said he asked both the company and the @entity26 to investigate whether guards were personally involved in sex trafficking , and that to his knowledge nothing was done			1
" @entity87 law , known as the trafficking in @entity187 , prohibits contractors from procuring commercial sex while working on the contract , " @entity17 said in a statement			1
" many of the prostitutes in @entity28 are young @entity193 girls who were taken against their will to @entity28 for sexual exploitation			0
" @entity17 said a trainee had boasted that he could purchase a girl for $ 20,000 and turn a profit after a month			0
" i immediately notified both the @entity26 and @entity23 's president , and urged the company to thoroughly investigate whether sex trafficking was occurring among the guard force ... to my knowledge neither @entity23 nor the @entity26 conducted a follow - up investigation , " @entity17 said			1
another former manager of guards in @entity5 spoke with @entity17 during the news conference			1
the second manager , @entity208 , is not involved in @entity17 's lawsuit but said he wanted to highlight what he called fraud , deception and incompetence , as well as what he called " sexually deviant behavior " exhibited by people hired as guards in 2007			2
@entity208 , who said he is a former @entity218 , also said he was forced out after he tried to spread the alarm about embassy security			0
" knowing full well that our jobs were on the line , we went to the embassy out of a sense of duty and patriotism , " @entity208 said			0
he said he went to the embassy to report problems after first complaining to @entity231 about what he called the company 's " inability to provide for the security and safety of the @entity87 personnel			0
" " in any interaction i have had with corporate officials from @entity23 , no one -- no one -- ever mentioned or indicated a concern for the actual safety of the embassy			0
the greatest and only concerns were the profit margin , " @entity208 said .			0
