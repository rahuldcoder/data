-- " @entity9 " is a special - effects - heavy movie invented to extend the brand of a commercial board game -- suitable for ages 7 and up ! -- in which two players move imaginary boats around a simple grid			1
that part 's not newsworthy			1
the surprise , for this veteran of board games , is that " @entity9 " is also the rousing , engaging , and emotionally complex action war picture the silly 2001 action war picture " @entity16 " only wished it could be			1
it 's " @entity16 " with greater intelligence , less hokum , and more aliens			1
for every line of howler dialogue that should have been sunk , there 's a nice little scene in which humans have to make a difficult decision			1
for every stretch of generic sci - fi - via - cgi moviemaking , there 's a welcome bit of wit			1
under the direction of @entity34 -- the talented , ever - maturing filmmaker behind " @entity36 " and " @entity37 " -- " @entity9 " is a sound vessel floating in @entity41 's oil - slick sea of " @entity44 " sequels and vampire riffs			1
the object of the original game is simple : attack an opponent 's '' fleet '' through a combination of mental strategy , deductive logic , and luck			2
the movie does n't forget these low - tech roots			0
there 's a nifty sequence in which sailors track incoming alien fighters using similar @entity59 - the - spot skills			2
but before getting to the hardcore blow - ' em - up portion of the humans - versus - aliens warfare entertainment , we are given time to invest in the relationship between @entity67 ( " @entity69 's " @entity68 ¥ rd ) and his younger brother , @entity71 ( @entity70 from @entity72 's " @entity36 " ) -- the former a courageous @entity73 officer of great character , the latter a corner - cutting showboater who is about to have his character entirely re-welded through the @entity73 challenges that await him			1
( @entity70 does an admirable , controlled job of steering his character from screwup to leader			1
) we understand that @entity71 loves a bombshell physical therapist named @entity84 ( @entity85 ) , and that @entity84 happens to be the daughter of crusty @entity89 @entity88 commander @entity87 ( @entity90 , barking but not biting )			0
we see the emotional - zeitgeist logic in the special interest that @entity84 has taken in the physical rehabilitation of an @entity95 veteran and amputee , authentically played by real - life @entity95 vet and amputee @entity99			0
we appreciate the pop culture traffic jam that has musical glam girl @entity103 passing muster as a tough ( yet cool ! ) fellow sailor			0
and we know to keep an eye on the conflict that rumbles at first between @entity71 and a @entity109 officer ( @entity108 ) because @entity110 hurts and fears left over from the real @entity16 will be worked out before the movie is over for the benefit of boomers and assorted granddads in the audience			0
it 's only once we know all these things -- carbon - based touches not found in the @entity121 product -- that " @entity9 " gets down to the business of hotshot combat between brave @entity73 fighters and aggressive alien visitors			1
( the invaders , by the way , appear to have studied " @entity44 " fashion magazines to design their space - metal wardrobes			0
) amid this fracas , there 's a welcome mood lightener in the form of a gentle comic - neurotic turn by @entity135 ( " @entity141 " ) as a deep - space scientist who has reason to regret his search for extraterrestrial life			2
" battleship " is gratifying that way			0
at the story 's center are all the clanging fireballs a kid could want to watch whizzing across a computerized sky -- not to mention naval strategy and a fact - based demonstration of real destroyer - ship capabilities			2
and surrounding the alien rumpus , the filmmakers have built an unexpectedly sincere salute to the awesome responsibilities of today 's @entity73 as well as to the heroic work of veterans who came before			2
for all that , the captains of this movie deserve a medal			0
