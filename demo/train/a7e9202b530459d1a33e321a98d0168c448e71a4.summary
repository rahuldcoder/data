twelve months ago , @entity0 made history for trainer @entity2 by capturing the @entity3 , arguably the world 's most prestigious flat race			1
@entity2 's former stable jockey , @entity6 , was not in contention that day			1
he was not even at @entity8			2
he was 200 miles away in @entity9 , where his best result was second place in a low - key class 4 handicap			2
on saturday , @entity13 will resume his rightful place alongside the country 's best jockeys when he lines up for the @entity3 's 235th running aboard 12 - 1 chance @entity18			1
it caps a remarkable reversal in fortunes for the veteran , who turns 50 next year			2
yet , like all the best true stories , this one has something of a ring of fiction about it			2
to many in racing , @entity13 is at once the most brilliant and most controversial jockey of his generation			2
his numerous successes on the track are matched only by his excesses off it			2
born in @entity39 , in the west of @entity38 , he was one of six children			2
although not from a racing family , @entity13 always had a natural affinity with animals			2
his love of horses was sparked by the wild @entity47 ponies that roamed the harsh landscape near his childhood home			2
" i 'd have to say it was a gift , because the first time i sat on a horse i was able to ride , " remembers @entity13			1
" i rode them through the fields with no saddle and bridle , just loose and wild			1
they would tear off across the field and i 'd stay on them as long as i could ! " from there he found his way to @entity63 , @entity38 's horse racing heartland			1
after serving his apprenticeship with trainer @entity66 , he crossed the @entity67 and eventually wound up as stable jockey to @entity69 , a relationship that would prove fateful for both parties			2
auspicious beginnings in his first season with the @entity75 , @entity13 recorded his first classic success , winning the @entity77 on @entity78 , following it up with the @entity79 a month later			1
he ended that 1997 season with 202 winners and the first of his six @entity84 titles			1
he retained the jockeys ' championship for the next two seasons , during which time he also won the first of his three @entity89 with oath			2
however , less than two months later @entity13 was summarily dismissed following allegations -- which he denied -- of an affair with @entity69 's wife			2
it was the first of a series of spectacular highs and lows which would come to define @entity13 's career			1
indeed , few sportsmen can boast a résumé as checkered as @entity13 's			2
in addition to his 16 @entity103 wins , he has @entity105 victories in the @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 to his name , and has twice captured @entity111 's ultimate prize , the @entity112 , with @entity113 in 2005 and @entity114 in 2007			2
but he has also served two bans for testing positive for recreational drugs , spent time in rehab for alcohol dependency , and was a defendant in a high - profile race - fixing case in 2007 , although he was cleared of all charges			0
he suffered a potentially career - ending shoulder injury in a fall at @entity123 in 2000 , earning him a place in the medical annals as the recipient of the world 's first successful nerve graft			1
then there are his fractured personal relationships : he was punched by owner @entity131 in 2010 , and banned for six months for pulling jockey @entity132 off his horse during a race meeting at @entity135 16 years earlier			1
as recently as last year , he was effectively blackballed by owner sheikh @entity136 , the main patron of his then employer @entity137 , seemingly ending his top - flight career once and for all			1
" from there it just fizzled out , " admits @entity13			0
last season , he rode just 80 winners			1
a new start yet @entity13 has rebuilt his career more times than he has rebuilt his battered body , and today he is once more a force in top - class races , 11 years after his last champion jockey title			1
last month , he won the @entity151 for the fifth time in a dramatic finish aboard @entity154 , some 14 years after his first victory in the race			0
come saturday , he has a realistic chance of landing his fourth @entity3 and completing what would surely rank as one of the all - time great sporting comebacks			1
his road to redemption began last winter when he headed to @entity107 to ride work for @entity166 trainer @entity165 following his dismissal by @entity168			0
he picked up a chance ride in an important race on @entity171 , the horse he credits with saving his career			1
" prince @entity171 was going to be my last ride , " he confesses			0
two weeks later , he won again , and @entity13 was back			1
" from being more or less dead and buried and on the way out , that really rekindled my buzz and my love for winning , " he says			0
@entity13 was soon snapped up by @entity165 and occupies the coveted top jockey spot at the stable			0
" i 'm really enjoying riding for @entity166 , " he says			0
" you could n't be in a better place , riding better horses for better people			0
" hard work rewarded indeed , @entity13 has now completed a unique full house , having been stable jockey for both @entity187 and @entity166 , as well as @entity188 and a pre-knighthood @entity69 when their stables were at their peak of dominance			1
" he 's one of the best jockeys in the world , " explains @entity165			0
" in big races you need a guy like him who has experience			0
" he 's very tough and he 's very fit			0
he comes every day to ride in the mornings and knows every single horse in the stable			1
" @entity13 's work ethic is something that even his detractors appear to agree on -- even @entity69 called him a very hard worker			0
in 2008 , when @entity13 received an 18 - month ban for his second positive drug test , he continued to ride out for @entity188			0
" i spent from first lot to fourth lot riding out and i really enjoyed it , " he says of that time			0
" i loved riding out with the lads and having a laugh , and getting physical exercise as well			0
" now in the twilight of his career , @entity13 appears to be in the best shape of his life , both physically and mentally			1
" i play golf and i play squash , " he says			0
" i like to cook -- fish , chicken , stews			0
i do n't eat a lot but i 'll eat little and often			0
i never let myself get hungry			0
" stranger than fiction has he finally banished the demons that haunted him throughout so much of his career ? " i 'm happy doing what i 'm doing at the moment			1
this time i 'm able to enjoy it because i ca n't really go anywhere now , this is it for me			0
i 'm just planning to get out there this weekend and just take it from there			0
" @entity13 could not have picked a more aptly - named horse for what might prove to be the final chapter of what has been , by all accounts , a sensational career			1
" @entity18 is really going well , " he says of his @entity3 mount			1
" he 's a big , well - balanced horse with a turn of foot			1
i do n't think he 'll have a problem handling @entity8			0
" standing in the way of @entity13 and his fairytale ending is @entity249 , trained by his former boss @entity2 and widely regarded as favorite to win the race			1
@entity2 's @entity187 and @entity166 are , of course , great rivals			0
and @entity166 , no stranger to reversals of fortune , having weathered its own doping scandal last year , is yet to capture @entity75 racing 's biggest prize			0
these omens do not appear to faze @entity13 : " i believe you make your own luck			0
enjoy it while you can			0
" from enfant terrible to master of reinvention , you would not bet against @entity13 producing an ending that is stranger than fiction .			1

@entity6 thought his career was over last season but is back at the peak of the sport
now just *shy* of his 50th *birthday* , he is targeting another prestigious @entity3 win
his career has been littered by controversy both in and out of the saddle
his targets are set on a potentially fairytale ending on board the horse @entity18
