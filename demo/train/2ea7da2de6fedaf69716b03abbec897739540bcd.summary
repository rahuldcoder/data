money makes the world go round , they say , but what if notes and coins were replaced with online code ? @entity8 -- the world 's much talked about cryptocurrency -- is just that			1
it ca n't be printed , it ca n't be directly controlled by governments or central banks , but it can be sent around the world instantly at a low cost			0
and in @entity18 , where 75 % of the population do n't have a bank account , experts say the currency could help millions of people pay bills and get to grips with their finances			1
transferring cash via a bank or a @entity28 ( @entity29 ) like @entity30 or @entity31 can be costly			0
according to the @entity34 , the average charge to transfer $ 200 to @entity18 using traditional money transfer services is 12 %			1
if you send $ 200 , you pay $ 24			0
the @entity34 added up all the transfers that happen in a year , and found remittance fees cost the @entity39 continent $ 1.8 billion a year			1
what if that money could be spent on things , rather than fees ? as @entity8 is a virtual peer - to - peer currency -- designed to operate on the border-less internet -- the costs of transferring money can be radically cheaper than traditional methods , and the process is much quicker			1
" @entity8 can greatly alter the remittances industry and beyond , " says @entity49 , who heads the @entity50 , a @entity51 - based group launched last may to promote digital currency technologies			1
" from seven days [ for a transaction to clear ] using banks & @entity56 , down to 20 minutes speaks volumes			0
" @entity39 examples @entity59 is a service in @entity61 that converts @entity8 sent from abroad into the local currency , cedi			1
since launching three months ago , it has attracted 30 users who pay a 3 % fee on each transaction rather than the average 12 % from traditional transfer services			1
@entity61 received $ 1.7 billion of remittance income in 2012 according to the @entity70 , and @entity59 's founders are optimistic about the future			1
" @entity8 is going to make a huge difference when it starts to get accepted by merchants in @entity61 , " says ceo @entity73			2
" people wo n't need to change @entity8 to any other currency so there will be no broker fees involved and people can get really very low - cost transactions			1
but @entity8 is in its early days yet , and we need banks and merchants to catch up			2
" and the founders are also planning to launch " @entity85 " -- a service which will allow people in other countries to use @entity8 to pay the water , electricity and phone bills for their family members in @entity61			2
@entity93 , a similar service in @entity61 , says it has processed over $ 90,000 worth of @entity8 , and @entity95 , in @entity51 , is another remittance services doing the same thing but with @entity51 shillings			1
another sign that @entity8 is gaining traction in @entity18 came in august , when @entity101 got the first @entity102 on the continent			1
the machine , which converts cash into @entity8 , is located at the @entity107 beauty salon where customers can pay in crytocurrency			2
but it 's not the only place @entity112 can spend their @entity8			2
according to @entity112 - based @entity115 , 30,000 online stores in @entity112 now accept the cryptocurrency			0
" we have about five transactions a week , and in total i would estimate we have had about 250 transactions , " explains @entity117 , who operates the machine			0
" the main reason we launched the @entity124 was to create awareness of @entity8 in @entity18 ... we do expect to see more [ @entity8 ] atms popping up			1
" commission charges for @entity126 vary , but @entity128 says the average commission is 5 %			0
and @entity18 's second @entity102 is set to arrive in @entity130 soon -- a city hosting a @entity8 conference in april			1
crypto - critics but not everyone is so optimistic about @entity8 's future in @entity18			1
critics say the fees associated with buying crypto - currency must be taken into account when considering the cost of remittances			0
as well as overcoming the technical challenges of obtaining @entity8 at an " exchange , " users have to also pay a commission			2
according to @entity128 , the fee is usually 0.5 % , but that can vary between exchanges			0
bypassing most of the online process is possible with voucher services like @entity152 , which charges a 4 % commission for the convenience			2
and @entity155 , based in @entity156 , have come up with a similar proposition involving qr codes on vouchers , which you scan with your smartphone			0
as well as standard charges , not all banks support @entity8 companies yet			2
some customers of @entity168 banks , for example , have to first transfer money from their bank account to a @entity8 company 's account in a @entity174 bank			1
to do this , they pay banking transfer charges and have to wait up to five days for the funds to clear before they get their @entity8			1
breaking traditions competition with existing , established services is also a major reason some say widespread adoption of @entity8 in @entity18 is still a long way off			1
@entity31 has agents in 25,000 locations across @entity18 , and @entity30 has 32,000 registered locations across the continent			2
while its yellow and black outposts are n't going away anytime soon , the company is adapting to mobile money transfer			1
" @entity18 , in particular , is kind of at the frontiers of mobile , " says @entity192 , chief executive of @entity30			2
" the people do like mobile , use it like mobile ... but also as a wallet			0
this mobile wallet has been very successful in @entity51			0
we did not see a big success in other countries ... but the future , i think , will be that , once the consumer figures out how to use it			0
" it is precisely this complexity , and this issue of trust , which makes the man who founded @entity112 's @entity8 exchange @entity214 skeptical about it 's widespread adoption on the continent			2
" you 've got a company like @entity30 , which has been around for longer than most people have been alive , and they trust that method , " says @entity216			0
" that 's a huge stumbling block for @entity8 acceptance			0
" for @entity216 , the real value of the super-secure " blockchain " technology which facilitates @entity8 could be in commodities trading where large sums need to be transferred across borders in a transparent way			0
erratic price value another major issue with @entity8 is its volatility			0
in january 2013 , one @entity8 was worth around $ 13 , surging in december to a high of $ 1,147			0
but since then , its value has dropped again and at the time of writing one @entity8 was worth $ 221 , according to coindesk			0
" if i buy @entity8 and transfer it to another person , the price is very likely to change overtime , " says @entity216			1
" so i could send $ 200 worth of @entity8 to someone , but as the price fluctuates they actually only get say $ 150			1
@entity8 is really only going to be a better deal for someone who really understands financial markets and watches the price constantly			0
further solutions need to be developed for mainstream adoption and tangible financial benefits			0

it costs less to send @entity8 overseas than traditional money
in @entity18 , 75 % of the population do n't have a bank account
@entity39 services like @entity59 and @entity95 convert @entity8 to local currencies
established money transfer *players* pose a challenge to @entity8
