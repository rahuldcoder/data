-- nine years ago , @entity1 was rescued from oldies - station oblivion with the smash @entity4 musical " @entity6			1
" the show chronicles the real - life rise - and - fall - and - rise - again of four crooners from the mobbed - up mean streets of 1960s @entity11 who called themselves the @entity13 and cranked out a seemingly endless string of hit records , including the love ditty '' @entity17 , '' the triumphant '' @entity18 , '' and the bouncy bubblegum bop of '' @entity20			1
'' the songs are timeless			0
but so are a lot of songs from that @entity25 and @entity26 era			0
what made the @entity13 magical was @entity1 's voice -- an impossibly high - pitched nasal falsetto that sounded like a prepubescent angel who 'd huffed a tank of helium			1
with " @entity6 ' " receipts still pouring in on the @entity35 , the notion of adapting the musical into a splashy song - and - dance @entity39 biopic must have been too juicy to resist			1
in fact , the only thing that might seem surprising about the " @entity6 " movie is the man squinting behind the camera , @entity46			1
but the pairing actually makes more sense than you 'd think			0
anyone who saw @entity46 's 1988 @entity52 film , " @entity53 , " knows that the guy 's always been a not - so - closeted hepcat with a discerning set of ears			1
the biggest problem is that the film , written by @entity60 and @entity61 , never makes a convincing case for why @entity1 the man or the singer matters beyond the music in the way that " @entity67 " and " @entity69 " did for @entity67 and @entity68			1
such are the perils of adapting a somewhat one - dimensional stage show			1
fortunately , @entity46 is far wiser on the casting front			2
as @entity1 , @entity73 is pretty close to perfection			0
that 's no shocker , really , as he won a @entity76 in 2006 for his portrayal of @entity1 on the boards			0
with his slicked - back pompadour and wardrobe of sharkskin suits , @entity73 looks more like the @entity82 than @entity1			2
but when he opens his mouth , you believe you 're listening to the real deal			0
he finds every ounce of sweat , aftershave , and salad dressing that made up @entity1 's one - of - a - kind voice			2
as his fellow @entity13 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 are equally spot - on , even if all of their bada - bing lingo occasionally makes them sound like they 're competing in a @entity99 impersonation contest			1
( both @entity91 and @entity92 starred in the stage version as well			2
) @entity46 has never been the kind of filmmaker to grab you by the lapels or hot - dog with flashy storytelling tricks			2
you can walk in halfway through just about any of his movies and know exactly where you are			0
his laid - back traditionalism has always been part of his appeal , though			0
and in chronicling the careers of @entity111 , he charts a predictably linear through - line : the band 's hardscrabble @entity115 - @entity114 roots , which lead them to a sentimental wiseguy ( @entity118 ) who takes them under his wing ; their first flirtation with fame ; the downward slide of excess , money trouble , and infighting ; and a redemptive third act in which they let bygones be bygones when they 're inducted into the @entity130 in 1990			0
the movie 's decades - spanning scope requires the 34 - year - old @entity73 to play @entity1 from age 16 to 60			1
as good as he is , he is n't done any favors by @entity46 's makeup team			0
you 'd think that after all the grousing over @entity140 's distracting mugful of old - age putty in " @entity142 , " the director would have paid more attention to the unconvincing wrinkles and jowls in the final stretch of " @entity6			1
still , as flat and pitchy as the film sometimes feels , what saves it are those nostalgic , soaring doo - wop numbers ( especially '' @entity17 '' ) and @entity46 's measured doses of directorial playfulness , such as when the actors cheekily break the fourth wall and talk directly to the audience , as they did on @entity4			2
this trick does n't always work , but when it does , and @entity1 or one of his bandmates turns to the camera , winks , and dishes about how the reality of events clashes with what we 're actually witnessing on screen , it gooses the film with a giddy jolt of jukebox electricity			0
