-- like giddy teenagers , @entity2 activists have fallen for another charming , personable and accomplished black conservative			1
dr. @entity5 is the newest object of their crush , which was born of a desperate need to attract more black men and women as high - profile standard - bearers			1
you ca n't blame @entity2 loyalists for swooning over the doc , a renowned surgeon who rose from poverty to head pediatric neurosurgery at @entity19 's famed @entity18			1
if wooing voters of color were simply a matter of finding an attractive black face with an inspiring personal story and an impressive resume , @entity5 would be hard to beat			1
but black voters tend to be more discerning than that			2
they have shown an unerring instinct for rejecting condescension and dismissing tokenism			0
there are many black @entity32 who admire @entity5 for his professional accomplishments ( i 'm one of them ) , but that admiration is unlikely to translate into votes			1
one of the reasons is that @entity5 does n't seem to know black @entity32 ' political values very well			1
in his most recent book -- a political tract called " @entity42 : @entity43 " -- he writes : " @entity32 voted for @entity44 simply because he was a black man and not because they resonated philosophically with his policies			1
" in fact , black voters have been increasingly allied with the @entity48 since the 1960s when @entity50 pushed through significant civil rights legislation			2
@entity52 received about 95 % of the black vote in 2000 , @entity54 about 93 % in 2004			2
moreover , @entity5 seems to have adopted the view , popular among so many ultra-conservatives , that the @entity48 appeals to voters who shun the work ethic			1
talking to the @entity60 recently about his conservative views , @entity5 described himself as a " flaming liberal " in college who later became disaffected with the @entity48			2
" one thing i always believed strongly in was personal responsibility and hard work , " he said			0
" i found the @entity68 leaving me behind on that particular issue			0
" that notion -- fallacious though it is -- is at least as popular among black conservatives as among white ones			2
i 've been hearing it from black @entity2 for at least two decades			1
several years ago , i interviewed a black conservative running a doomed campaign for a suburban @entity78 congressional district			0
she had no prior political experience , no policies to advance , no program to sell			0
her platform consisted of her belief in hard work , which she contrasted , at least implicitly , with black @entity48 ' supposed preference for sloth			0
that view is as puzzling as it is infuriating			0
it may charm those white conservatives who hold stereotypical views of black @entity32 , but it bears little resemblance to the realities that inform their choices at the ballot box			1
in his memoir , " @entity102 , " and in his motivational speeches , @entity5 talks about his impoverished childhood and his remarkable semiliterate mother			2
married at 13 only to later divorce her philandering husband , she enforced high academic standards for @entity5 and his brother while working two or three jobs as a maid or nanny -- and battling debilitating depression			1
@entity5 eventually got into @entity113 and became , at 33 , the youngest person to head a department at @entity18			2
he is famous for separating conjoined twins			0
that 's a compelling and powerful tale			0
but it differs from those of other hardworking black people i know only in the degree of success that @entity5 attained as a result , not in the measures of ambition , industriousness , discipline and self - respect his mother instilled in her children			1
yet black @entity32 know better than to believe those traits are enough to guarantee success			1
just look back over the last decade and a half			0
in 2000 , according to the @entity138 census , less than a quarter of black @entity32 -- 22.5 % -- lived in poverty			1
by 2010 , that number had risen to 27.4 %			0
was there a sudden outbreak of indolence among black folk over that period ? or were there outside forces that conspired to knock them back down the economic ladder ? as long as the @entity2 refuses to acknowledge that , it will have little to offer workers of color -- and declining appeal to younger whites			1
they , too , understand the limits of self - reliance			1
to be helpful to the @entity2 , @entity5 would have to remind them of the caprice of capitalism and the generational reach of racism 's barriers			1
instead , he sounds like the standard - issue @entity165 acolyte , no different from @entity167 or @entity168			0
he opposes the @entity169 and supports a flat tax			0
for good measure , he 's also a religious conservative who disputes evolution			0
it 's no wonder that conservatives have started to trumpet him as their @entity177			0
psychologists believe that romantic interest increases when people mirror each other 's gestures			0
@entity5 perfectly reflects the beliefs of his suitors			2
still , this romance is unlikely to blossom into a long - lasting love affair			0
there are too many misunderstandings , too many unspoken expectations , too many half - baked assumptions			0
and some of those half - based assumptions are @entity5 's			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2

@entity194 : @entity2 are desperate for more high - profile black *candidates*
she says they have swooned over @entity5 , a renowned surgeon who rose from poverty
@entity5 has a great life story but puts too much faith in the power of self - reliance , she says
@entity208 : many @entity32 realize that outside forces also determine success or *failure*
