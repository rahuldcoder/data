@entity0 -- a new rule requiring airlines to include government taxes and fees in their advertised price is continuing to cause turbulence in the travel industry -- and a congressman said monday he 'll introduce a bill to overturn it			1
rep. @entity11 , @entity12 , said monday he will introduce a bill to cancel the @entity14 @entity16 rule , which took effect last week			1
the rule requires airlines to roll mandatory per - passenger taxes and fees into the advertised fare , but allows them to break down the costs elsewhere in the advertisement			1
before the rule , airlines frequently advertised low base fares on online sites and added taxes and fees later in the shopping process			1
the @entity16 and some consumer advocates argued the airlines were hiding the true cost of air travel			2
but @entity11 and some airlines said the new rule allows the government to hide government taxes and fees			1
" if the @entity14 people ca n't see these costs clearly , i fear it will be easier ( for ) these fees and taxes to be raised without their knowledge , " @entity11 said in a statement			2
" if the goal of the @entity16 's rule is to prevent companies from deceiving passengers about the total cost of their ticket , why is the department mandating that airlines hide the taxes , surcharges and government fees in the fine print ? " @entity11 said			1
" transparency and honesty in ticket pricing should apply across the board			0
" the clash between the @entity16 , the airlines , consumer groups and others has been loud and brash			2
@entity64 has configured its website with a big " warning ! " pop - up sign			0
the message : " new government regulations require us to hide taxes in your fares			0
this is not consumer friendly or in your best interest			0
it 's wrong and you should n't stand for it			0
" the @entity16 's top lawyer responded with a letter calling the ad campaign " misguided and disingenuous			2
" " contrary to its direct assertion that the rule requires airlines to hide the amount of government taxes and fees , the rule does not prevent carriers from disclosing the amount , type , and nature of government taxes and fees that are associated with air travel , " @entity16 general counsel @entity83 wrote			1
" carriers are free to describe the components of the full price , including government taxes , so long as the description is not deceptive , " he wrote			0
the move to introduce legislation was commended by @entity104 , the trade organization that represents the major @entity14 airlines			0
" we support this effort to require @entity16 to return to its previous regulation , which does not artificially distort the base price of an airline ticket , and ensures that customers always know exactly how much they are paying in federal aviation taxes and fees before they decide to purchase , " said @entity106 , vice president of communications for @entity104 said in an e-mail			1
" federal taxes and fees now constitute $ 61 , or over 20 % , of the cost of a typical $ 300 domestic round - trip ticket , putting aviation at a higher tax rate than alcohol , beer , cigarettes and firearms			0
" @entity1 's @entity125 contributed to this report .			0

as of last week , airlines must *highlight* total fare , including fees and taxes
the *breakdown* of fees and taxes can be shown elsewhere in an ad or online
@entity12 congressman says he 'll file a bill to cancel the @entity16 rule
