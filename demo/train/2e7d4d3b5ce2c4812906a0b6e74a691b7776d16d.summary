-- @entity2 @entity1 dealt @entity3 a desperate and potentially damaging blow with the goal that salvaged a 1 - 1 draw for bitter rivals @entity7 and stopped the @entity8 returning to the top of the @entity10			1
@entity1 earned @entity7 the point they deserved with a header three minutes from the end to deny @entity3			2
@entity3 had grabbed the lead when @entity15 , captaining the @entity17 club for the 250th time , swept home a low drive midway through the second half for his 14th goal of the season			1
but @entity1 earned @entity7 the draw their contribution deserved when he met @entity25 's 87th minute free - kick with a powerful header from inside the six - yard box			2
@entity30 striker @entity29 returned to @entity3 's starting line - up for the first time since november following hamstring problems , for the 209th @entity35 derby			2
and @entity29 should have broken the deadlock in the first half when he surged between @entity38 and @entity39 only to prod his shot against a post from a few meters			0
referee @entity42 was kept busy as the tackles flew in and he lectured @entity44 , @entity38 and @entity25 after a series of fouls on @entity15			0
@entity42 later refused @entity3 a penalty two minutes after the interval when @entity29 went down theatrically after being nudged by @entity39			0
@entity7 believed they were entitled to a spot kick when @entity50 looked to send @entity52 tumbling			0
the referee again waved away the appeals , and the complaints were still raging on the pitch -- and the touchline -- as @entity3 surged away for @entity15 to crash home a 30 - yard drive to put the hosts ahead after 68 minutes			1
it had been more than 10 hours since @entity7 had conceded a goal and it looked as though it would be enough to send @entity3 back to the top ahead of @entity66			0
@entity1 had other ideas -- and the sides will go through it all again on sunday when @entity3 host @entity7 in an @entity71 fourth round clash .			1

@entity2 @entity1 denies @entity3 win with late goal as @entity7 draw 1 - 1
@entity3 had grabbed the lead when @entity15 struck after 68 minutes
