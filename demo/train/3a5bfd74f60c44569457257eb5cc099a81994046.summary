@entity0 , @entity1 -- on february 2 , 7 - year - old @entity3 crossed a street to get to his elementary school in @entity6 , @entity1			2
this scenario takes place thousands of times uneventfully each school day in our country			2
but this time @entity3 did not make it to school			0
a crossing guard was halting traffic at the time , but the busy intersection did not have a traffic light and one vehicle did not see the boy			0
@entity3 was struck by an suv and died that same day in the hospital			0
remind children to walk , not run , when crossing the street , so drivers have a chance to see them			1
as a parent who walks my young child to school every day , @entity3 's story is tragically heartbreaking , but unfortunately not unique			0
in fact , according to the @entity32 , nearly 5,000 pedestrians died and 70,000 were nonfatally injured in traffic crashes in 2007			1
children are at particular risk because of their size , immature judgment and lack of experience with traffic rules			1
as we promote walking as a healthy and environmentally sound way to get to school , how can we make sure our children make it there safely ? read @entity32 's tips on walking and biking safety can seeing red help ? @entity52 , president and ceo of @entity54 , a pedestrian advocacy organization based in @entity0 , believes that traffic lights or flashing red lights in school zones can make a difference			1
she cited studies showing that having a marked crosswalk without a light may be more dangerous than having no crosswalk at all , and that yellow lights tend to get ignored compared with red			0
flocks encourages the public to urge their legislators to invest in traffic safety measures such as red lights , which can ultimately benefit motorists , cyclists and pedestrians alike			2
speed kills according to a @entity75 @entity77 study , speed really matters			0
a pedestrian hit by a car traveling 20 mph has a 5 percent chance of being killed , while one hit at 40 mph has an 85 percent chance			1
flocks suggests that radar signs that tell how fast you are driving and photo enforcement of speeders at intersections near schools could help save lives			0
even without the threat of getting a speeding ticket , i would hope the risk of injuring or killing someone else or ourselves would be enough to remind most of us to slow down , especially in school zones and other congested areas			1
give walking and driving your undivided attention it 's well known that the distraction from talking on a cell phone while driving can be as bad as or even worse than driving drunk			1
new research shows that cell phone use while walking can also be distracting			1
psychologist @entity106 and his associates from the @entity108 at @entity109 reported in the february 2009 issue of @entity111 that preadolescents ( ages 10 and 11 -- when most children are mature enough to cross the street by themselves ) talking on cell phones had a greater chance of being hit or nearly hit during a simulated road - crossing exercise			1
@entity119 explains that crossing a street is much more complex than we may realize , with the need for assessing such variables as the approaching vehicles ' direction and speed , along with the distance and time needed to cross the street			0
adding a diversion such as a cell phone conversation causes risky behavior and delayed reactions			1
use common safety sense do n't check your common sense at the door when you leave for school			0
encourage your children to wear brightly colored clothing			2
try to walk in groups , and be sure to include adults , who are taller and more visible to drivers			2
remind children to walk , and not run , when crossing the streets , so that drivers have a chance to see them			1
finally , do n't take any traffic risks : if you 're not sure whether you can cross safely , wait until you can			0
it could happen anywhere @entity3 's story took place in metropolitan @entity0 , but it could happen anywhere in @entity155 , in my neighborhood or yours			0
mourners have placed stuffed animals and flowers at the intersection where @entity3 was killed			2
i 'm going to put some at my crosswalk too , in hopes of reminding us all to be safer pedestrians and drivers			1
after all , our lives -- and our children 's -- may depend on it			2
@entity171 , @entity172 , is an @entity0 - area pediatrician and mother			0
she contributes regularly to @entity174			0

@entity32 : nearly 5,000 pedestrians killed , 70,000 injured *non-fatally* in 2007
children at risk because of size , immature judgment , lack of experience
drivers should slow down in pedestrian areas ; walkers should hang up cell phone
