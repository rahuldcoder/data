@entity0 -- the year 2012 is a significant one in the @entity2			1
the ancient long count calendar of the @entity4 , a @entity6 civilization that flourished across @entity7 and @entity8 from 2000 bc to the time of the @entity10 , states that on the 12th december , 2012 , the sun will be aligned with the center of the @entity13 for the first time in approximately 26,000 years			1
and 21 december , 2012 , is said to mark the end of the 13th @entity2 , a 144,000 - day cycle or " b'ak'tun " since the mythical @entity4 day of creation 5,200 years ago			1
though popularly interpreted as signifying the " end of the world as we know it , " scholars stress that the end of the " b'ak'tun " does not mean apocalypse			1
while few @entity4 people still follow the long count calendar , the @entity23 is celebrating the event by naming 2012 " @entity27 , " with members of the @entity23 greeting the winter solstice on top of @entity32 pyramid at the @entity34 site in @entity35			1
" experiencing the @entity37 on the summit of @entity32 is thought to be one of the greatest opportunities to experience the end of the 13th @entity2 and dawn of a new age , " said @entity36 , executive director of the @entity23			1
but their celebrations have a serious side : the @entity23 is highlighting the dangers to @entity48 sites such as @entity34 , which are threatened by looting and deforestation , and hoping to secure the investment to turn these neglected spots into thriving and sustainable tourist destinations			1
" @entity53 ( in @entity35 ) has proven that major @entity4 archaeological sites are economically sustainable through visitation and with appropriate investment , can generate hundreds of millions of dollars for conservation and maintenance of both the cultural and natural heritage , " said @entity36			1
@entity1 's @entity62 's treasures asked @entity36 to compile a list of key @entity4 sites across @entity65 for maya - enthusiasts keen to ring in the dawn of a new era sitting on the monumental steps of a temple or at the summit of an ancient pyramid			1
