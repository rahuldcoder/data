-- @entity1 has always been a popular form of music because its improvisatory nature is easily adapted by a community or nation to reflect its individual identity			1
@entity9 policemen watch a demonstration near the @entity11 in @entity12 in december 1981			1
in @entity14 , jazz has been intertwined with its politics and through it , has gained its own particular identity and recognition , as has @entity14 as a nation			1
the @entity20 marked a turning point in @entity9 history			1
after 300 years of divided rule under @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , @entity14 became an independent democratic republic lasting until the outbreak of the @entity29 in september 1939			0
the end of the @entity20 also marked the spread through @entity32 of @entity34 jazz			2
according to polishjazz.com , the first @entity9 jazz band was started in 1923 by @entity36 and @entity37 , calling itself simply @entity36 & @entity38			1
it was an almost immediate success , playing in popular @entity12 venues of the time			2
other popular dance bands established themselves during the 1920s and the first jazz recordings were being recorded by @entity9 record label @entity45			1
with the rise of the @entity51 and accompanying anti-semitism under @entity53 in neighboring @entity54 , @entity47 musicians such as @entity48 and @entity49 came to @entity14 , enriching the @entity9 jazz scene with their talent			1
@entity48 became the best and most popular jazz musician , who later on in his life became a driving force of @entity61 jazz			1
throughout the 1930s , the music of @entity34 jazz artists such as @entity64 was widely available and popular , as were the first music magazines from @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity34			1
this flourishing scene came to an abrupt end with the invasion and occupation of @entity14 by the @entity73			0
the end of the war saw @entity14 being occupied yet again , this time by the @entity61 @entity76			0
@entity14 , now called @entity77 , became a @entity61 - controlled puppet state			0
music fell under @entity61 control too and jazz , with its syncopated rhythms and free style , did not fall into the prescribed mould			2
in @entity14 , jazz was banned and went on to develop its own style underground			1
during the first half of the 1950s , the death of @entity88 and @entity90 's appointment as first secretary in the @entity9 regime had a more liberalizing effect on the country			1
@entity1 was out in the open once more ; being listened to , talked about and played without fear			1
the first jazz magazine behind the @entity98 was published ; official jazz clubs were created and the @entity100 was started by @entity101 in 1964			2
@entity101 went on to found the @entity102 which became one of the largest jazz organisations of @entity32			2
the 50s also saw the first official jazz festival taking place in @entity108 beginning a tradition of jazz festivals in @entity14 that lasts to this day			2
initial hopes that @entity90 's reforms would move towards democratisation were dashed but despite political obstacles , @entity14 's cultural and intellectual life continued to grow and flourish during the following decade			0
@entity1 was being featured in tv programmes ; jazz critique was growing as were jazz festivals			1
in 1964 , the @entity1 at the @entity121 festival in @entity122 started			2
another milestone of the decade was the start of the recording of " the @entity127 " by the official recording label @entity129			0
it continued doing so until well into the @entity131 , later re-releasing all the volumes in cd format			0
during the 1970s , @entity134 replaced @entity90 as first party secretary			0
he , being on a more friendly footing with @entity138 neighbors than his predecessors , received loans and with them , the slow trickle of @entity138 goods ( notably @entity144 ) and tv shows into @entity14			0
the government 's @entity148 stance also allowed @entity9 culture to reach out to the @entity151			2
the leading @entity9 jazz magazine @entity152 was being published in @entity9 , @entity153 and @entity54 and distributed in 103 countries			1
trumpeter @entity155 came to the fore during this period , receiving the first @entity158 in 2002 as one or @entity32 's most outstanding jazz musicians			2
towards the end of the 70s , @entity134 's political career came to a close after a wave of labor strikes resulting from his policies			0
it was in this turbulent time that the independent trade union , the @entity170 , was started in the @entity171 by @entity172			0
@entity170 's growing strength led @entity174 to declare martial law in december 1981			0
however @entity177 's reforms in @entity26 ; pressure from @entity9 pope @entity179 and @entity138 leaders forced the @entity181 to the negotiating table			1
this led to @entity170 's participation in semi-free elections 1989 resulting in a coalition government			0
@entity172 became president of @entity14 until 1995			0
the political events were reflected in the jazz scene			0
the early 80s brought the " @entity193 " movement lead by @entity192			0
according to allaboutjazz.com , musician @entity194 described his movement as being " verbally critical and musically adventurous , " revolutionzing @entity9 jazz			1
@entity192 is still a driving force of @entity1 today			2
one of the purely @entity9 streams of jazz are the interpretations of the music of @entity9 composer @entity202 started by pianist @entity203			1
reflecting the new freedom brought by democratisation another important band came to the fore at the beginning of the 90s			0
this was " @entity211 , " playing free jazz , going so far as to describe its form of jazz as " yass " thereby creating a new stream or genre in @entity9 jazz			1
but it too followed the path of the @entity221 by becoming more mainstream			0
current jazz reflects the diversity that democratic and economic freedom have brought @entity14			0
a multiplicity of small jazz clubs have sprung up throughout the country as have a number of jazz festivals and independent record labels			0
