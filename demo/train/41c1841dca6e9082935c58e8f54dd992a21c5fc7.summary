from the @entity0 -- i love animals and i love the outdoors			0
the @entity5 and the coastline that surrounds it is a special place to me and millions of other @entity9			1
right now there are more than 40,000 people working to save it in the wake of the @entity15 disaster			0
they 're trying to plug the well , save the wildlife and clean up the oil			1
seeing the oil and the action up close is one thing			2
getting your hands dirty and feeling the enormity of the job is another			0
i now understand what it takes			0
of course , the big difference between me and them is they do it every day			0
these are the heroes doing their part to save the @entity5			1
when the spill happened i assumed all you needed was a few skimmers to surround the slick and suck up the oil			2
one thing i 've learned reporting in this oil disaster : nothing is as easy as it seems it should be			1
my embed on the @entity45 showed me the dirty , slippery and agonizingly slow process of skimming weathered @entity5 sweet crude			1
it 's a nasty business			2
searching for , rescuing , rehabilitating and releasing oiled wildlife is also a process that requires agility , patience and , most of all , a gentle touch			1
my embed with the @entity55 had me based on a barge in the middle of the marsh			0
i followed fellow animal lovers on a hunt for oiled wildlife			1
the rescued birds were brought to the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 , where they 're cleaned , given medical care and nursed back to health			1
i got to hand feed a sick baby pelican -- an emotional moment words ca n't describe -- followed by transporting rehabilitated birds to @entity70 , where we released them into an oil - free wildlife refuge			1
another emotion - filled spiritual rush			2
cleaning the beach seems easy			0
well , it 's not -- especially in 100 - degree blazing sun and relentless humidity			2
i took the required hazmat training course and suited up for a full day of tar ball pickin ' fun			0
ok , it was n't really fun -- but it made decent tv			0
" rescue " wraps up on the lighter side with an appreciation for the guys working the beach dressed in rubber and @entity91			0
i had the opportunity to go shoulder - to - shoulder with the men and women out here getting it done , and it 's an experience i 'll never forget			2
i hope you 'll join me on the journey and tune in to " rescue : saving the @entity5			1
" [ fellow @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 worked behind the camera and sweated it out with smiles every step of the way			0
