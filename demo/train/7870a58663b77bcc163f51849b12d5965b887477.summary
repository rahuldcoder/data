survivors have recalled the harrowing few minutes after @entity2 's landing gear slammed into a seawall around @entity5 's airport , setting off a chain of events including a fire , the ejection of flight attendants and a frenzied evacuation			1
but what about the minutes before the @entity12 crashed ? a day after relaying pilots ' accounts to investigators , @entity14 chairman @entity13 provided more details wednesday on what happened in the sky			1
one focus has been whether " automatic " controls in the cockpit were working			2
even if they were n't , questions have been raised about whether the pilots recognized that something was wrong quickly enough and did the right thing to fix it			1
moments before touching down , the pilots said they were making horizontal changes to adjust their path and vertical adjustments to affect their altitude			1
@entity13 has said they did n't notice they were coming into too low until they were about 200 feet above the airport			2
to put that in perspective , the independent @entity33 states that most planes approaching an airport " require ... an immediate go - around " -- meaning they should not land -- if they 're not at the right speed on the right path by the time they 're about 1,000 feet up			0
' there are no ambulances out here ' : 911 calls detail horror of crash in flight 214 's last 2Â½ minutes , the pilots were making adjustments , including , apparently , adjusting some automatic functions that control things like airspeed and other key factors			1
it 's not clear how all those functions were working , but the pilots did say the " auto throttle " was switched on but did n't regulate the speed as they 'd expected			1
" we need to understand what those modes were : if they were commanded by the pilots , if they were activated inadvertently , and if the pilots knew what they were doing , " the @entity14 chairman said , referring to evidence of " multiple autopilot modes and ... auto throttle modes			1
" such tools can help an airliner run more efficiently and effectively			0
but they do n't mean that pilots do n't have a responsibility , @entity13 said , noting that someone in the cockpit is typically charged with monitoring what 's going on			1
" when you think about automation , it can do a lot , it can assist the pilots , " @entity13 told reporters			1
" but there are two pilots in the cockpit for a reason			1
" co-pilots for airlines will need more training the final minutes in the air the man at the helm -- whom @entity13 called the " flying pilot " and who was halfway through training on flying a 777 -- spent the day before the fatal flight at home and got about eight hours of sleep			2
when he reported to work , he told investigators , he arrived at the airport a little early , knowing he 'd be working with his " instructor pilot " -- who would be seated next to him on the voyage across the @entity106 -- for the first time , @entity13 said			0
@entity14 : pilot was halfway through training to fly 777 the instructor pilot was also relatively well - rested , having had a day off followed by eight hours of sleep			2
together , they were in the front seats of @entity2 for about 4 hours , 15 minutes before being relieved for about 5 hours by a relief crew on board			2
then the two returned to their seats for the trip 's last hour and a half , according to the @entity14 chief			1
at around 4,000 feet above sea level , the pilots recognized they were coming in too high and made some adjustments , @entity13 said			1
at 11:26 a.m. saturday , when they were about a mile and a half away , they were given clearance to land			0
the three men in the cockpit told investigators the auto pilot was off but the auto throttle -- a device that automatically regulates speed -- was switched on and set to 137 knots ( 157 mph )			0
after noticing the plane was too slow and too low , around 200 feet , the flying pilot pushed the throttle forward			0
also , one of the pilots said that at some point , his sight was affected by a flash of light , something the @entity14 chairman said authorities ca n't yet explain			1
the first minutes on the ground while authorities have not laid blame or cited a cause , it appears the pilots ' efforts in those last few minutes were too little , too late to avert a crash			1
the aircraft 's main landing gear slammed into a seawall between the airport and @entity158			2
the tail pounded down soon after that			0
how does an air crash investigation work ? the aircraft spun 360 degrees , shedding parts , flooring , magazines and more that would be later found strewn about the runway			0
three flight attendants who were ejected from the plane were found on the runway too , @entity13 said wednesday			2
( none of the passengers ' seats were ejected			0
) eventually , the 777 screeched to a stop			0
that 's when the lead flight attendant approached the cockpit and asked if they should evacuate			1
the flight crew , which was then talking with the air traffic control tower , said no. an announcement over the aircraft 's speakers told passengers to stay in their seats			1
then , one flight attendant noticed flames outside , around row 10 , and told another attendant to relay the information to the cockpit			2
at that point , the evacuation process began			0
this whole process -- from the plane stopping to the evacuation order -- took about 90 seconds , @entity13 said			0
that 's the amount of time , she pointed out , in which @entity198 regulators say an airliner should be entirely cleared of passengers and crew			2
about two minutes after the crash , the @entity14 chief added , first responders were on site			1
about a minute later , there were firefighters equipped to douse any flames			0
' working as hard as possible ... to recover ' but no one could save @entity211 and @entity212 , the 16 - year - old girls from @entity214 who died due to the crash			1
girls killed in crash were headed for camp on wednesday , their relatives took a bus to the crash site at @entity222 , a source close to @entity224 told @entity225			1
they wanted to see where their children had died			0
other buses arrived later wednesday night bringing crash victims to the same locale , allowing them to see the destruction up close once again			2
of the 307 passengers and crew aboard the @entity234 - to - @entity5 flight , 305 survived			2
out of those , 123 were uninjured , while the rest went to @entity238 hospitals			0
some of them were still there wednesday , including a handful in critical condition			0
even those who are n't in hospitals are suffering			0
six of the jet 's 12 flight attendants suffered injuries serious enough that they have n't been interviewed yet by investigators , @entity13 said wednesday			1
the six others , meanwhile , appeared briefly in front of reporters wednesday			0
one of them was in a wheelchair			0
( @entity13 said that one of the flight attendants had broken her leg but was no longer hospitalized and had talked to the investigators			0
the flight 's cabin manager , @entity259 , said she and the rest of the crew are " working as hard as possible in order to recover			1
" she added , " i hope for all the families who have suffered losses from this accident to recover as quickly as possible , as they are in my prayers			0
" flight attendants hailed as heroes			0

victims visit crash site at @entity222 , following relatives of 2 @entity214 teens killed
@entity14 chief : the pilots made *numerous* adjustments in flight 's last few minutes
automation is useful , but pilots must still monitor what 's happening , she adds
cockpit crew did n't want to evacuate plane immediately after crash landing
