after four weeks of dominance , " @entity3 " finally did n't finish first at the box office			1
instead , the relationship comedy " @entity5 " took the crown as it debuted to an impressive $ 33 million this weekend			1
based on comedian @entity11 's bestselling advice book " @entity9 , " the @entity8 film performed much better than expected			1
( although i predicted the movie would win the weekend , i thought it would do so with a moderate $ 19 million			1
) " @entity5 " was produced for just $ 13 million by @entity15 - owned @entity14 , which was also behind two other pictures that premiered at no. 1 this year : " @entity17 " and " @entity18			1
" the studio 's marketing campaign targeted @entity22 audiences via appearances on @entity11 's morning show , screenings at historically black universities , and special promotions on networks like @entity29			0
the effort clearly paid off			0
for instance , " @entity5 , " which was directed by @entity32 ( " @entity33 " ) , opened stronger than all of @entity37 's movies except " @entity38			1
" and like @entity37 's films , the movie skewed toward adult women , with 63 percent of the audience being female and 62 percent at least 30 years old			0
it received an excellent " a " rating from @entity46 audiences			0
in second was the @entity8 romance " @entity49 " with $ 22.8 million			1
that 's a return to form for star @entity51 , as the movie performed more like " @entity53 " ( $ 23.7 million ) than " @entity54 " ( $ 12.4 million )			1
it 's also a solid showing for author @entity56 -- the only @entity58 adaptation that opened stronger was 2010 â€² s " @entity59 " ( $ 30.5 million )			1
despite unfavorable reviews , the $ 25 million movie earned a respectable " b + " grade from @entity46 participants			2
young women represented the majority of the film 's audience , with 76 percent of ticket buyers being female and 52 percent under the age of 25			2
" @entity74 , " @entity72 's fourth annual @entity71 nature documentary , captured a solid $ 10.2 million -- enough for fourth place			1
that 's the biggest opening weekend among the four @entity77 pictures , beating " @entity78 , " " oceans , " and last year 's " @entity80			2
" ( however , it 's not an entirely fair comparison since " @entity78 " opened on a wednesday			0
) as was the case with " @entity5 " and " @entity49 , " the movie drew a predominately female crowd -- women made up 68 percent of the audience			1
and @entity46 moviegoers gave " chimpanzee " an overall " a " rating			0
on a curious note , 5 percent of @entity46 participants said a main reason for attending the film was its " lead actor			0
" were they referring to the film 's two lead apes ? or narrator @entity98 ? even stranger , 1 percent listed " lead actress " as their reason for buying a ticket -- and that 1 percent gave the movie a harsh " b - " grade			2
clearly those individuals were upset by the documentary 's lack of actresses			0
among holdovers , " @entity3 " slipped just 31 percent -- its smallest decline yet -- for $ 14.5 million , pushing its domestic tally to $ 356.9 million			2
the sci - fi thriller crossed $ 350 million on saturday , reaching the milestone in 30 days			2
only seven other movies have ever passed that mark in less time			0
and in fifth place , the @entity8 - rated comedy " @entity119 " dropped 46 percent for $ 9.2 million			2
in limited release , the critically acclaimed music documentary " @entity122 " debuted to $ 260,000 at 42 locations for a sturdy per - theater average of $ 6,190			0
and the @entity127 comedy " @entity130 , " starring @entity128 and @entity129 , picked up $ 46,300 at four locations			0
" @entity5 " -- $ 33.0 mil 2			1
" @entity49 " -- $ 22.8 mil 3			1
" @entity3 " -- $ 14.5 mil 4			0
" chimpanzee " -- $ 10.2 mil 5			0
" @entity119 " -- $ 9.2 mil see full story at @entity134 .			0

" @entity5 " debuted with $ 33 million at the box office this weekend
the film was produced for just $ 13 million
@entity51 's " @entity49 " came in second
