@entity0 -- in public @entity2 are putting on a brave face , insisting the queen 's illness is little more than a stomach bug and her hospitalization merely a " precautionary measure			1
" but behind the castle walls there is cause for concern			1
the main worry is dehydration , quite common for anyone suffering from gastroenteritis ; usually it is treated by replacing lost bodily fluids with water			0
five things to know about gastroenteritis but the queen is finding it difficult to keep any fluids down			0
for this reason she was taken to the @entity25 in @entity0 , the first time she has been in hospital for 10 years , where she is currently hooked up to an iv drip			0
@entity2 have canceled all the queen 's official engagements for the next week , including a high profile visit to @entity33			1
senior advisers have spoken of their concerns to the @entity36 and it is believed the queen , who is 87 next month , will be asked to take things easier over the coming months			2
though the queen is always described as being in " robust " health , her advisers are acutely aware there will come a point when she has to slow down			1
for this reason the @entity45 and @entity46 have been taking on far more high profile engagements recently as they prepare for the day they will formally replace the queen			1
a source inside @entity51 said : " @entity52 and @entity53 have subtlety created a more regal air over the past year and are beginning to look , and act , like a @entity56 in waiting			2
behind them the ever - popular @entity57 and @entity58 have now progressed to being senior members of the royal family			0
" if the queen is convinced to cut back on the amount of engagements she carried out she will do so with the knowledge the family ' firm ' is well taken care of behind her			0
" the queen who hates to make a fuss the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity73 .			0
