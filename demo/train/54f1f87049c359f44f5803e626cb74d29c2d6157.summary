@entity0 -- a same - sex couple has asked the @entity3 to intervene in a cross-state dispute over their efforts to have both of them officially listed as the parents of an adopted 5 - year - old boy			1
the @entity12 couple filed an appeal this week with the high court , saying @entity15 , where the child was born , has an unconstitutional policy against adoption by unmarried couples			1
the state used that policy to justify naming only one of them on an amended birth certificate			1
the men , @entity25 and @entity26 , argue that gay couples have a due process right to be listed on such certificates as joint custodial parents			1
a federal appeals court has ruled against the couple			1
the case could have broader implications in the current legal fight in state and federal courts over same - sex marriage and whether states -- and @entity0 -- must honor legal rights that gays and lesbians enjoy in other states			2
the men , who live in @entity45 , had legally adopted a year - old boy from @entity47 , @entity15 , in 2006			2
the adoption was finalized in @entity49 , where the couple was then residing			1
in their appeal , spearheaded by the gay rights advocacy group @entity52 , the couple said it is important both practically and symbolically that they both be listed as the legal parents			0
" obtaining an amended birth certificate that accurately identifies both parents of an adopted child is vitally important for multiple purposes , including determining the parents ' and child 's right to make medical decisions for other family members at the necessary moments ; determining custody , care , and support of the child in the event of a separation or divorce between the parents , " the legal brief said			1
lawyers for the men also said it is vitally necessary for @entity79 and tax purposes , inheritance , insurance , school registration , and obtaining a passport			0
@entity25 and @entity26 tried to have the birth certificate changed in @entity15			1
all states have laws creating a right to accurate , amended official birth and identity documents that would be recognized in other states and by the federal government			2
@entity93 , @entity15 's registrar of vital records and statistics , refused their request			0
she took the position that the term " adoptive parents " in the applicable section of state law applies only to married parents , because in @entity15 , only married couples may jointly adopt a child			1
@entity15 state officials argue they have not refused to recognize the @entity49 adoption decree , and had offered to list one of the parents on the official amended birth certificate			1
but @entity25 and @entity26 insisted both of them should be named			0
the 5th @entity114 ruled in april that @entity25 and @entity26 can not file a federal civil rights claim under the @entity117 's " full faith and credit " clause			0
that refers to @entity121 , section 1 , which says states must respect the " public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state			0
" the full 16 - member court , in an 11 - 5 ruling , concluded the clause applies only to court actions , not those of state legislators or executive officials , and added that " there is no legal basis on which to conclude that failure to issue a revised birth certificate denies ' recognition ' to the @entity49 adoption decree			1
" more importantly , the court said states have the power to make their own decisions about issuing birth certificates			0
" adoption is not a fundamental right , " said the appeals court , citing studies that found marriage provides a more stable environment in which to raise children			2
" @entity15 has a legitimate interest in encouraging a stable and nurturing environment for the education and socialization of its adopted children			0
... @entity15 may rationally conclude that having parenthood focused on a married couple or single individual -- not on the freely severable relationship of unmarried partners -- furthers the interests of adopted children			2
" the @entity3 is likely to decide in late september whether to accept the case for review			0
if it does , oral arguments would likely be held early next year , and a ruling would come some weeks afterward			0
a decision by the justices not to intervene would be a final legal defeat for @entity25 and @entity26 on the certificate question , but would not affect their continuing custody of the boy			0
the case is @entity25 v. @entity26 , @entity177 ( 11 - 46 ) .			0

@entity15 refuses to list two men as adoptive parents on an amended birth certificate
the men argue they have a due process right to have both officially recognized
the adoption was finalized in @entity49 , but the child was born in @entity15
