-- as the players run on to the court , the excitement begins to build in the arena full of fiercely loyal basketball fans			1
it 's a small arena with capacity for only 1,200 people , not counting standing - room - only tickets			2
as the members of the team are introduced , fans jump up to cheer them on , clapping and chanting , full of team spirit			2
" i 've been yelling my heart out ! " says a fan who arrived early for the game			0
the team is " the @entity25 " and on a recent night it was playing at home in @entity20 , a town of 33,000 in northwestern @entity21 , known for its large deposits of copper and other metals			1
one of the largest mining companies in @entity21 operates in the town about 35 miles south of the @entity29 border			1
it 's an unlikely place for foreigners , but not when it comes to sports			1
@entity35 , 29 , is an @entity36 immigrant in @entity20 and a star forward for the @entity25			0
@entity35 attended @entity38 in @entity39 and has also played in @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			0
but @entity20 is much closer to his native @entity43			0
" the town is very small , but the people are very energetic when it comes to basketball , " says @entity35			2
he does n't speak @entity48 , but that does n't seem to be a problem on the court			0
teammate @entity52 , another immigrant athlete , says he has learned a few words			0
" i do n't think you want to hear what i 've learned in @entity48 , " @entity52 says with a smile			0
the 25 - year - old from @entity58 , who attended the @entity60 at @entity61 , says he has fallen in love with @entity21 food , especially carne asada , or @entity21 - style grilled steak			1
communication among team members is made possible by head coach @entity68 , a @entity69 native and former player in @entity21 leagues , who is bilingual			1
other teammates are bilingual as well			0
" it 's a good challenge because i have to talk in @entity48 and in @entity74 at the same time sometimes , " says @entity68			0
the @entity25 are one of 12 teams in what is known as @entity78 ( the @entity48 acronym for @entity80 of the @entity81 )			2
dozens of foreigners play on the league , with teams in most of the northwestern @entity21 states , including @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , home of @entity20			1
under @entity21 law , each basketball team is allowed no more than three foreigners on the roster			1
the law also allows one additional foreigner born to @entity21 parents per team			1
@entity98 owns the @entity99 , another team in the northern @entity21 league			1
he says communication has never been a problem for his team			0
" other team members usually speak both languages			0
if they do n't , they 're used to playing with @entity36 players and i always look for coaches that speak both @entity48 and @entity74 , " says @entity98 , who also speaks fluent @entity74			2
the 30 - year - old worked for five years in the @entity113 as a scout for the @entity115 and the @entity116			0
@entity111 says that some @entity117 play in @entity21 leagues to stay on top of their game while looking for other opportunities			1
" obviously money is a factor			0
it 's a job to have in professional basketball , first of all			2
but second of all , being in @entity21 is close to home for @entity117 , " says @entity111 , who has a home in @entity128 where his wife lives			1
five - thousand dollars a month , the average salary for a foreign athlete at this level , may seem terrible in the @entity117 , but that kind of money can go a long way in @entity21 , where minimum wage is less than $ 5 per day			1
to survive , a team needs to spend about $ 350,000 per season			2
it does n't sound like much , but it becomes a challenge when fans in @entity20 pay just over $ 6 per ticket			0
the season in northern @entity21 is four months long			1
some players use the rest of the year to play in eastern @entity150 and @entity36 leagues			1
in a country that sends countless migrant workers to the @entity117 every year , some find it ironic that they 're being entertained by migrant @entity36 athletes			0
" migrant workers from here go look for a better future in the @entity117 in this case , these guys are coming here to keep on doing what they love for a living , " says @entity156 , a @entity25 fan			0
as the game draws to a close , @entity35 scores another three - pointer , clinching the victory for the @entity165 in an action - packed reminder that a good ball game knows no borders .			2
