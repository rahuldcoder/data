next month , @entity1 president @entity0 will become the first sitting @entity1 president to visit @entity3 , the strongest endorsement yet of the country 's efforts to tread a path to democracy			1
much has changed in a year since @entity1 secretary of state @entity9 made a historic visit to the country in december 2011			1
@entity12 was also invited to enter @entity3 , also known as @entity3 , for the first time in years			1
with an official journalist visa stamped in our passport , we and other media invited for @entity19 's visit , knew this was a big change for a country that has repelled any kind of scrutiny for half a century			1
@entity25 : what 's behind sectarian violence in @entity3 ? @entity0 's visit will come at a time when @entity3 is in the news again but not for the right reasons			1
violence between @entity34 muslims and local @entity35 continues in @entity36 in the west of the country			1
the @entity39 says at least 89 people have been killed in the past two weeks and 110,000 are displaced			2
some aid organizations are questioning whether now is the right time for @entity0 to add legitimacy to the government of president @entity45			1
but there 's no denying a lot has changed in the past year and a half			2
read more : @entity49 has " soft spot " for the military generals so far , a quasi-civilian government has been sworn in , although the military still holds great sway			0
hundreds of political prisoners have been released , ceasefires have been signed between the government and some but not all ethnic groups			2
political and economic reform is well underway			0
another change that did n't make headlines but has been clear to us during numerous trips over that 12 - month period is the attitude of the @entity3 people			1
last year , very few people would speak to us on camera or in some cases even off - camera for fear of retribution			0
decades of brutal military rule turned freedom of speech into a luxury most could not afford			0
@entity49 : peaceful freedom fighter but just four months later , during a bi-election in which the freed opposition leader @entity49 and her party won almost all seats , caution was thrown to the wind and celebrations were passionate and unrestrained			0
thousands of jubilant @entity49 supporters spilled into the street , holding posters of the woman who had spent much of the past two decades under house arrest -- these were scenes which just a couple of years earlier would have ended in arrest and imprisonment			0
@entity96 , a man from @entity97 , had a simple explanation of the election			0
" the people were living in prison			0
@entity49 held the key to open the door , " he said			0
we , as journalists , were welcomed and thanked on the streets as if the fact we were there documenting these changes meant they could never be reversed			0
read more : @entity3 eases restrictions on news organizations but not one person we spoke to over many months said their lives had physically improved			1
they were more hopeful and believed democracy was now possible but they were still struggling to survive			0
@entity120 life is hard for many @entity3			1
a country that was one of the richest in @entity123 50 years ago is now one of the poorest			2
authorities are struggling to shore up institutions and update laws to protect people and resources from hungry international investors snapping at @entity3 's heels			2
the ethnic unrest in @entity134 state has tested the efforts of president @entity45 's administration to seek reconciliation with @entity3 's different ethnic groups			1
there 's no doubt that some changes in @entity3 have been swift and @entity45 deserves the international praise he is receiving			2
but the transformation from pariah to ally is not complete and the skeptics among us worry it could yet stumble .			0
