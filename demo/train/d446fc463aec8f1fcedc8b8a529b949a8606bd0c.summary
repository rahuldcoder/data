-- men may rule the roost in @entity4 's hit drama " @entity5 , " but behind the guys are a group of women whose lives shape the award - winning story			1
writers from the tv show " @entity1 " pick up awards at the @entity16 ceremony in february			1
a young woman sits in a bustling office , wringing her hands as she waits to confront her boss			2
nerves palpable , she is readying herself to demand four walls in a company where all the women sit at open desks			1
" i need my own office , " she says when she gets 30 seconds of face time			2
" it 's hard to do business and be credible when i 'm sharing with a @entity31 machine			2
@entity33 's office has been vacant for some time			2
i think i should have it			0
" " it 's yours , " her boss says matter - of - factly			1
" really ? " " you young women are very aggressive			1
" " oh , " she recoils a bit			0
" i did n't mean to be impolite			0
" " no , it 's cute			0
there are 30 men out there who did n't have the balls to ask me			0
" so goes a typical scene in " @entity5 , " @entity4 's @entity48 - winning mega-buzz drama about the inner workings at 1960s ad agency @entity5 , which just began its third season			1
the exchange , from last season 's penultimate episode , is between @entity54 , an up - and - coming copywriter struggling to get ahead in a man 's world , and @entity58 , a partner at the firm			1
true , the interaction is dated			0
you wo n't hear that kind of dialogue in today 's workplace -- not unless the boss wants a lawsuit -- but @entity67 , " @entity5 's " executive story editor , would argue it 's less a product of the decade than viewers might think			1
" the truth is that a lot of these moments that seem period and horrible for women come directly from experiences that i and the other women writers have had in our lifetimes , " says @entity67 , one of seven female writers on the show 's nine - person writing team			1
" like the [ first season ] episode ' @entity83 ' where @entity54 goes into the bathroom and there are women crying			1
that came from [ consulting producer ] @entity91 's life experience			1
" that 's not the only office drama @entity91 says she 's seen firsthand			0
" @entity54 assumed that @entity94 in @entity95 wanted to talk to her and valued her opinion , and it turned out he really just wanted to date her			0
that 's something that has certainly happened to several women on the staff , including myself , in our early days out [ in @entity103 ] , " she says			1
" men like women , and women want to be valued for more than just being attractive , and sometimes those things intersect			1
that 's certainly not something that 's decade - specific			1
" @entity0 : how to speak up to get what you want what is time - specific , @entity67 says , is the way the ulterior motives are communicated			1
" there 's more decorum about it now , " she says			0
" people have trained themselves to hide it better			0
i 've worked in many offices , and that stuff still goes on			0
it 's just not as blatant , and women have learned to draw lines a little more strongly			1
" both writers are quick to point out that while gender biases still exist in the workplace , they do n't exist in their workplace			2
in the " @entity5 " writers ' room , a great idea is a great idea , they say , no matter who came up with it			1
" we have a predominately female writing staff -- women from their early 20s to their 50s -- and plenty of female department heads and directors , " @entity91 says			1
" [ show creator ] @entity140 and [ executive producer ] @entity139 hire people they believe in , based on their talent and their experience			1
' can you capture this world ? can you bring great storytelling ? ' " much of that storytelling revolves around the three main female characters : @entity150 ( wife of main character @entity152 ) , an unhappy suburban housewife who 's just learned she 's pregnant ; @entity153 , the sultry @entity5 office manager who 's always dreamed of a husband and white picket fence but is suddenly having second thoughts ; and @entity54 , the would - be careerwoman quietly climbing the agency 's ladder			1
@entity0 : behind the scenes with @entity161 all three seem to fit nicely into convenient 1960s boxes , but @entity91 says the fun is in showing the characters ' true complexities			0
" those are labels that we , as society , place on these three women , " she says			2
" but we never talk about the characters in those terms in the writing room			2
@entity153 wants certain things , and we 'll definitely discuss that she wants to move to the suburbs , she wants love			0
but they 're people ; they have different shadings			0
we do n't think of them as , ' okay , @entity153 's the sexy bombshell , so her storylines all have to be about using her sexuality to manipulate people			0
' we start with , ' this is a person who wants this ... ' " it 's all about staying true to the characters and the time period , @entity67 says , even when that means adding details that make the writers cringe -- say , putting a cigarette into the hands of an expectant mother			2
" we always have to remind ourselves that we ca n't judge these characters			0
we try not to protect them , " she says			0
" women did smoke back then while they were pregnant			2
they knew it was wrong on some level , but they did n't think it was that wrong			0
no one 's going to chastise another woman for doing it			0
so while it 's horrible for us to watch , it 's important for us not to change it , because it happened			0
" @entity0 : why a writer should feel like he 's over his head while the " @entity5 " writers try to check gender at the door when they enter the writers ' room , both @entity67 and @entity91 recognize that theirs is a highly unusual situation			1
according to a 2006 report from the writer 's @entity220 , women are under - represented on tv staffs 2 to 1			1
" i do n't think [ having so many women ] influences the way the female characters are written , but i think you have a larger pool of experiences to draw from , " @entity91 says			1
" if you have a predominantly male staff , it 's their point of view of how a woman would react as opposed to the actual experience of being a woman			1
" " occasionally , we 'll embarrass one of the guys by pulling the curtain back too far , and then they 're shocked to see how the female mind operates at the basest level , " @entity67 jokes			2
" but we sort of delight it in , and that 's when we know that we 're possibly saying something new			0
" they claim that , when it comes to the job , being female is secondary			2
still , when @entity91 mentions her anticipation of the upcoming season debut , you ca n't help but notice she chooses different words than her male counterpart might			2
" it 's always like birthing a baby when you finally get to the premiere			0
