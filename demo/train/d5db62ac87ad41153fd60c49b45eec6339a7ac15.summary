@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a remote corner of the @entity1 , a blue lake shimmers amid the sand dunes			1
it 's not a mirage , but a man - made oasis -- an unintended byproduct of the @entity1 's water management practices , which has sprung from the desert in recent years			1
opinion is divided over this unexpected phenomenon , known locally as @entity0			0
@entity15 is a university lecturer who has been an avid birdwatcher in the @entity16 for nearly two decades			0
" this is one of the best sites in the @entity1 for birds , " he said			2
" it 's a good habitat for wintering birds and birds on passage			2
" to @entity15 , @entity0 has reliably proved something of a birdwatcher 's paradise , with herons , flamingos and stilts among the rich diversity of species drawn to this rare water source			2
he has been coming to the lake for seven years to photograph the birds , insects and reptiles and add them to @entity36 -- his photographic inventory of nearly 600 species of the country 's wildlife			1
but to others , like @entity42 , an ecologist at the @entity1 's @entity43 , @entity0 is an environmental calamity			1
" this lake to me is a bit of an ecological disaster because we really do n't understand how it 's affecting all the various species that do live naturally within this environment , " she said			1
" if you suddenly create an artificial situation , where many other species benefit , it is the species that have been here for millions of years that then suffer			0
" read more : @entity60 - a camel pageant in the @entity1 the lake is an industrial byproduct of the desalination system used to meet the @entity1 's water needs			1
with few sources of fresh water in the region , the country has relied on desalinating seawater for domestic use -- a technology that has been essential to the country 's growth , according to advocates			2
" @entity77 started here 50 years ago , " said @entity75 , president of the @entity76			0
" there would n't be any development of the industry or society if there was no desalination			0
" the waste water is treated and just over half reused for industrial purposes , according @entity86 , executive director at the @entity87			1
but the other 45 % of recycled waste water was simply discharged at sea or released on to the land , where it had been pushing up groundwater levels , and eventually resulted in the creation of @entity0			1
watch : @entity95 banks on its history desalination has increased as the @entity1 's population has grown , bringing with it other unwanted environmental impacts			1
the process is energy - intensive , and releases brine into the surrounding ocean , which has the potential to harm marine life			0
as a result , the government is encouraging people to reduce consumption , and put excess water to better use			2
" people can reduce their water consumption , be more wise when it comes to water use , " said @entity86			0
" when washing your car , instead of using a hose , maybe use a bucket			0
when it comes to the agriculture sector ... we are looking to reduce our consumption , and increasing the use of treated water in those areas as well			0
" it 's an approach that will help improve the @entity1 's environmental sustainability , but could spell the end of the already shrinking @entity0 , to the dismay of @entity15 and his fellow birdwatchers			1
" i 'd be very disappointed if @entity0 disappeared , " said @entity15			0
" i 'm hoping it does n't			0

a lake has *emerged* amid the sand dunes in the @entity1
it is a result of recycled waste water *dumped* from the @entity1 's water management system
it attracts a wide variety of wildlife , *delighting* birdwatchers
but desert ecologists consider the lake an environmental disaster
