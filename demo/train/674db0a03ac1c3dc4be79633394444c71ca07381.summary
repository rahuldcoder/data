@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 members agreed friday to form a " spearhead " force of several thousand land troops ready to deploy within a few days , @entity4 chief @entity8 said , as the trans - @entity10 alliance grapples with the threats posed by @entity14 's interference in @entity15 and the rise of @entity17 in @entity18 and @entity19 the troops would be backed by air , sea and special forces support , he said , with a command and control center and extra equipment in @entity26			1
" this decision sends a clear message : @entity4 protects all allies at all times , " @entity8 said on the second day of a @entity4 summit in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" and it sends a clear message to any potential aggressor : should you even think of attacking one ally , you will be facing the whole alliance			0
" the new readiness action plan , which includes proposals for more short notice exercises , is intended to help @entity4 respond swiftly to @entity14 aggression and other international conflicts			1
" in these turbulent times , @entity4 must be prepared to undertake the full range of missions and to defend allies against the full range of threats , " @entity8 said			1
he said @entity4 members also " stand ready to assist @entity19 " in its fight against @entity51 extremists if @entity52 asks for help			2
but pressed by reporters on exactly what aid @entity4 would offer , @entity8 toned down his remarks , saying @entity4 is prepared to consider a " defense capability building mission " in @entity19			2
president @entity58 said friday that " there 's great conviction that we have to act as part of the international community to degrade " and ultimately destroy @entity17 jihadists that pose a long - term threat to member countries			1
the @entity68 has sent military advisers to @entity19 to help that country combat @entity17			1
@entity73 -- a @entity4 member -- said friday it also will send " several dozen " troops to @entity19 to help advise that country 's government on fighting @entity17 , prime minister @entity72 's office said			1
responses to threats posed by @entity14 's interference in @entity15 and the rise of @entity17 in @entity18 and @entity19 were at the heart of discussions of the alliance 's meeting in @entity1			1
@entity58 rebuffs @entity14 warnings on @entity4 , @entity15 @entity14 's annexation of @entity88 and involvement in the unrest in eastern @entity15 have alarmed @entity4 members such as @entity92 and the @entity93			1
a rapid - reaction force would give those nations more security amid @entity98 's deteriorating relationship with the @entity99			2
@entity68 officials have stressed that any force would be defensive in posture and not a provocation to @entity14			1
@entity58 said friday at the end of the summit that " @entity14 's aggression against @entity15 threatens our vision of a @entity26 that is whole , free and at peace			2
" he also rebuffed @entity14 warnings against @entity4 membership for @entity15 , saying membership in the alliance remains " open to nations that meet our high standards			1
" the comments echoed @entity8 's earlier remarks			0
" no third party has a veto " on new members joining @entity4 , @entity8 said			2
also friday , prime minister @entity121 said the @entity122 would be willing to contribute 3,500 personnel to the new @entity4 force			1
@entity125 , a senior editor at @entity126 in @entity127 , said it 's important to get a rapid - reaction force " that is pre-authorized , a bit like a pre-authorized credit card , so that if there is a crisis , it can be deployed very quickly by @entity4 military commanders			1
" otherwise , activation of the force could get bogged down in political discussions , @entity125 told @entity2			0
greater spending the allied nations also agreed to work toward increasing defense spending over the next decade as part of their @entity4 commitments , @entity8 said			1
the goal : 2 % of gross domestic product , 20 % of which will go toward equipment , over the next decade			0
the @entity15 crisis is a major reason for the decision , he said			0
while he said @entity14 has increased defense spending by 50 % in the last five years , @entity4 nations have cut back on average 20 %			2
" @entity14 aggression against @entity15 is a wake - up call , and i think this is exactly what has led capitals in @entity4 allied nations to reconsider defense investments , " @entity8 said			2
" because it is now obvious that we can not take our security for granted , and we will have to invest more in our defense and security			0
" the recent revival of a @entity14 threat in @entity26 has upended some of the assumptions that had underpinned @entity4 's earlier expansion in the region			0
" this is the first time since the end of @entity172 that one @entity26 country has tried to grab another 's territory by force , " @entity8 said thursday			0
" @entity26 must not turn away from the rule of law to the rule of strongest			0
" @entity125 pointed out that when @entity4 first brought @entity26 countries such as @entity92 and @entity180 into its fold in the late 1990s , it decided to regard @entity14 as a friend rather than a threat , forgoing plans to defend the new member states			0
" the whole idea was that @entity4 would be in partnership with @entity14 to deal with other security issues , " he said			0
" that 's changed because @entity14 did n't like that arrangement			0
@entity14 has bullied its neighbors			0
" opinion : @entity4 's moment of truth on @entity15 @entity2 's @entity195 reported from @entity0 , while @entity196 reported and wrote from @entity197 and @entity198 from @entity127 .			0
