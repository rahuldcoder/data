-- @entity1 has refreshed its line of @entity4 notebooks , dropping in more powerful processors and knocking $ 100 off the price			1
the 11 - inch @entity4 , with @entity7 of storage , now sells for $ 899 and options range up to a 13 - inch screen with @entity11 of storage for $ 1,199			2
the new versions of the computers , which @entity1 announced tuesday , contain fourth - generation @entity16 i7 processors			1
@entity1 says the new processors work with its @entity19 operating system to provide 12 hours of battery life on the 13 - inch models and 9 hours on the 11 - inch @entity22			1
a more radical overhaul of the popular laptop line is expected later this year			0
@entity1 - centric blog @entity25 is reporting that @entity1 is developing a hybrid , 12 - inch @entity4 that would perform like the larger , more powerful model while being almost as portable as the current 11 - inch @entity4			2
in the meantime , the company appears to be addressing one of the common gripes from the anti-apple crowd -- that more powerful pcs can be had for a fraction of the cost of @entity1 's laptop and desktop offerings			0
