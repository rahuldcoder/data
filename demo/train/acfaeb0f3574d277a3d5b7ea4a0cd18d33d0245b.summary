@entity0 released new images monday of the dwarf planet @entity3 that hint at crater - like structures on the surface			1
the images of @entity3 , the largest object in the asteroid belt between @entity10 and @entity11 , were taken by the @entity12 from a distance of 238,000 miles on january 13			0
with a diameter of about 590 miles , @entity0 describes the dwarf planet as " @entity16 - sized			2
" " we know so much about the solar system and yet so little about dwarf planet @entity3			1
now , @entity12 is ready to change that , " @entity19 , @entity12 's chief engineer and mission director , said in a release from @entity0 's @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24			2
@entity0 's @entity26 took the best images to date of @entity3 in 2003 and 2004			1
while the latest set of images is only at about 80 % of @entity26 's resolution , @entity0 expects the decade - old images to be eclipsed when the spacecraft has another imaging opportunity at the end of this month			0
@entity12 , which was launched in 2007 , is expected to enter the dwarf planet 's orbit around march 6 for the first time			1
scientists have long thought the surface contains vast portions of ice or even an ocean , and have previously detected water vapor			0
@entity3 falls into the same unique category of dwarf planets as @entity46			0
according to the @entity48 , this classification is for a celestial body that " is in orbit around the sun , " " has sufficient mass for its self - gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium ( nearly round ) shape " but is not able to " clear the neighborhood around its orbit , " meaning the body is big enough to clear objects like asteroids and debris out of its orbital way .			0

@entity0 's @entity12 delivers new images of the dwarf planet @entity3
