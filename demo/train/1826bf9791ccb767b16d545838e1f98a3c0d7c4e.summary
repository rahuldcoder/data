@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 voters need to decide what they really want from @entity6			1
on the one hand , voters are dismissive of presidential and congressional candidates who can be called " flip - floppers , " people who shift positions or agree to compromise			1
on the other hand , voters rail against a dysfunctional @entity6 that seems unable to reach agreement on almost anything because politicians on the right and left do n't seem willing to compromise as a result , the approval ratings of @entity21 have fallen to only 9 %			1
voters insist they want the type of candidate who wo n't compromise , and thus wo n't be able to cut the deals that are needed to break through the partisan gridlock			1
indeed , the term flip - flopper has become one of the dirtiest words in @entity4 politics			1
when candidates have a record that reveals inconsistencies in their position , their opponents pounce			1
in 2004 , president @entity39 's campaign eviscerated @entity41 presidential candidate sen. @entity40 through a devastating campaign that focused on this point			1
in one television ad , @entity44 showed @entity40 windsurfing , arguing that this was a metaphor for his approach to politics			0
the narrator stated : " in which direction would @entity40 lead ? @entity40 voted for the @entity55 war , opposed it , supported it and now opposes it again			0
... @entity40 : whichever way the wind blows			0
" right now the top candidates in both parties are viewed by many voters as flip - floppers			1
for some @entity68 , one of the biggest problems with president @entity67 has been that he has governed too much like president @entity69			1
rather than standing on principle , he has made deals			0
the president has consistently reached out to centrists and has been willing to accept the best that he could get , rather than challenging his opponents to a tough fight			0
on the other side of the aisle , there is former @entity81 gov. @entity80 , the front - runner who @entity44 love to hate			2
his critics argue he is a politician willing to stand for anything that will get him elected			0
they point to positions he has taken a stand on , issues such as abortion , health care and gay rights , and note how he later changed his stance for political expediency			0
in response to a question during one of the @entity44 debates , @entity94 gov. @entity93 said , " i think @entity4 just do n't know sometimes which @entity80 they 're dealing with			1
" @entity99 , a @entity2 contributor and editor of redstate.com , wrote , " @entity80 is not the @entity39 of 2012 -- he is the @entity102 of 2012 , only conservative because a few conservative grand pooh - bahs tell us @entity80 is conservative and for no other reason			2
" even before the @entity44 nomination battle is decided , president @entity67 's surrogates such as @entity107 are already attacking @entity80 as a flip - flopper			1
the critics of @entity67 and @entity80 are picking up on the fact that voters react negatively to candidates who shift their positions			1
and there are forces in both parties that are pushing for the kind of candidate who will stand firmly on principle and not negotiate with the other side			2
yet if these are the ideals that we demand of our elected officials , it will certainly be more difficult to solve @entity4 's problems			1
there seems to be no room any more for politicians like sen. @entity132			2
the @entity133 @entity44 and @entity134 in the 1960s was a striking figure			0
with his baritone voice and wavy white hair , @entity132 was a memorable politician who passionately believed in the art of compromise and was often willing to cut a deal			2
indeed , his critics often complained that he was all compromise and no principle			2
one southern @entity145 refused to join a birthday celebration for @entity132 , explaining , " he is a delightful companion , but he changes too often for me			0
i never know where he is			0
" @entity132 did n't really care			2
he liked to quote @entity149 as saying " consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds , " believing the job of the legislator was to find or shape bills that could pass			0
as a result , he was able to make bold moves to make legislative deals even when they defied some of the core ideals of his party			0
@entity132 , for example , was instrumental in ending the filibuster against the @entity164			0
with @entity166 opposing the bill , the @entity165 depended on him to deliver enough votes to reach the 67 required to end debate and bring the bill to a vote			2
though he was not a champion of civil rights , @entity132 emerged as a towering figure on @entity175 as a result of this and other deals			0
some of the most successful presidents of the 20th century did n't practice what they preached			2
president @entity181 was notoriously difficult to pin down , embracing programs that appealed to the left and the right , such as cutting government spending in 1933 while expanding the regulatory power of @entity6 at the same time			1
president @entity187 is often praised for having negotiated a historic agreement with the @entity189 in 1987 , even though he had spent much of his career railing against other @entity44 and @entity68 who were willing to sit down and talk with the @entity191			0
of course we do n't want presidents and legislators who stand for nothing and simply move whichever way the wind blows			0
but flexibility and pragmatism are virtues as well			0
if we are to fix @entity6 , the city needs more figures like @entity132 , @entity181 , and @entity187 , individuals who love the craft of politics and the art of making deals			1
but if the nation insists on electing politicians who have a pure partisan track record , compromise will be hard , if not impossible , to achieve			0
at some level , @entity4 will have to come to learn to love the flip - flopper if they really want to end the legislative stalemate we 've seen for more than a decade			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			1

@entity218 : @entity4 voters want candidates who are n't flip - floppers
but they also criticize @entity6 for failing to solve @entity4 's problems , he says
reaching agreement on legislation takes compromise , @entity218 says
