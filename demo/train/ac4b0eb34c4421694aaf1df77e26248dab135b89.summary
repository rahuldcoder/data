-- " damn it , i knew i needed to get in touch with @entity3 when i 'd heard he was ill , that he had been admitted to the hospital for respiratory ailments			0
how did i let this happen ? " those where my initial thoughts sitting on the tarmac at @entity11 reading the texts and e-mails about @entity15 's death friday morning			1
@entity3 was a friend , a country music legend , an influence to me and to countless other musicians			1
if you are n't able to fully hear and appreciate @entity15 ' voice , you really ca n't fully appreciate country music			1
his voice opens up country music 's depth and power			1
you feel it or you do n't			0
it helps to have done some living and to have had your heart broken , like @entity3 did			1
and it really helps if you can hang around one of its greatest singers , which i was fortunate enough to do over the years			2
during a show at the @entity37 in the mid- ' 90s , i heard the great bluegrass singer @entity38 say that if you have a musical hero , you should do anything you can to be near that person			2
for him that meant driving @entity45 's tour bus			2
for me , it meant hanging around @entity47 , my hero when i moved to @entity48 , and the lead singer of a band called " @entity51 , " which played tuesdays at the @entity52			0
stars react to legend 's death @entity47 idolized @entity15			1
it was through him that i began to " hear " @entity3 , not just listen to him			2
there is a big difference between listening and hearing			1
i had listened to @entity3 growing up with my dad , a big country fan			2
i had listened to him in high school again , when i discovered @entity63 and found out @entity63 also loved @entity3			0
but it was n't until i was in @entity48 and hanging out with @entity47 that i finally heard @entity15			1
the tone and the ache of his voice clicked			0
i heard how every word @entity3 sang was first filtered through a broken heart			1
from time spent together backstage at the @entity75 , visits at the home of @entity3 and his wife , @entity77 , dinner at his favorite @entity79 's or @entity80 , i cherished every moment in his presence , getting to hear firsthand accounts of stories i had read , the jokes and the laughter , the love between him and @entity77			1
having the opportunity to sing to @entity3 from the @entity75 stage for his 75th birthday in 2006 and to record in the studio together are unforgettable highlights of this crazy honky tonk dream			0
people will always say that " @entity96 " was @entity3 's best song and perhaps the greatest country song of all time			1
i certainly would n't disagree			0
but do yourself a favor and dig a little deeper			0
one of those nights when you are feeling down or lonesome , instead of going to the usual modern day distractions , grab some whiskey and listen to " @entity104 ) , " " @entity105 , " " @entity106 , " or my favorite , " @entity107			0
" put your heart in @entity3 's hands and trust that he will take care of it			1
that is what great country music ( at least my favorite kind ) and great country singers do ; that is what country is all about : consoling the lonely , letting you know someone else has been there and has felt the way you do			1
it 's about walking you through the hard times			2
my dad was a member of this country 's greatest generation			1
he grew up in @entity128 and fought in @entity129			0
there are n't many left			0
@entity3 is a member of country music 's greatest generation			1
and there are only a handful of those men and women left			0
go to their shows , talk to them if you can			0
let them know how much you appreciate their music and if you are lucky enough , their friendship			2
let them know the impact their singing or songwriting has had on your life			0
but do n't do it for their sake , do it for your own			0
so that when they are no longer with us , you might feel just a little less sad			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			2

@entity160 : his friend and *inspiration* , country music legend @entity15 has died
he says listening to @entity165 means " hearing " him ; his words filtered through a broken heart
he says in @entity15 ' *catalog* you can hear what great country does : reaches out , consoles
@entity160 : @entity15 part of country 's " greatest generation . " thank them while you can
