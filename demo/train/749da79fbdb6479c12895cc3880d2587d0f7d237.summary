the @entity2 government is grappling with an unpredictable hostage crisis whose terms are being dictated by the @entity7 extremist group @entity6			1
the militants appear to have killed one of the two @entity2 hostages they have been holding			1
and they 're apparently demanding the release of a convicted terrorist in @entity13 to spare the life of the other			1
here 's where things stand at the moment : a video file posted online saturday by a known @entity6 supporter shows an image of one hostage , @entity23 , holding a photo of what appears to be the corpse of his fellow captive , @entity29			1
the voice of a person claiming to be @entity23 speaks over the image , saying in @entity33 that @entity2 prime minister @entity34 is to blame for @entity29 's death			1
" you were given a deadline , " he says , referring to @entity6 ' earlier demand that @entity2 pay $ 200 million by friday to save the lives of the two hostages			1
the voice then announces a new ultimatum : the release of @entity44 , an @entity45 woman facing the death penalty in @entity13 for her role in a series of bombings in 2005 that killed dozens of people at hotels in the @entity53 kingdom			1
@entity34 said sunday that experts were analyzing the video but that it seemed " highly credible			2
" @entity57 authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity			0
an @entity6 - affiliated online radio station , @entity60 , reported that the recording was released by the extremist group			1
it also reported the killing of @entity29 and the prisoner swap demand for @entity66 in its newscast sunday			1
it did n't identify @entity23 by name			0
but @entity23 's stepfather , @entity70 , raised doubts about whether it was his stepson 's voice in the video			1
" i get the sense it 's not his voice , " he told reporters			2
" i 've heard his @entity33 a couple times			0
i felt it was a bit different			0
" @entity34 condemned the apparent killing of @entity29 and called for @entity23 to be released immediately			2
" such act of terrorism is outrageous and impermissible , which causes me nothing but strong indignation , " he said			0
but the @entity2 prime minister declined to comment on how his government would respond to the new demand , which does n't appear to have a clear deadline			2
after @entity6 released the first video of the hostages tuesday , @entity2 set up a crisis center in @entity13 and said it was trying to communicate with the militant group through third parties , such as governments in the region and tribal leaders			1
@entity2 officials declined to explicitly rule out paying a ransom but said they would n't yield to terrorism			0
they stressed that an aid package @entity34 had pledged to countries affected by @entity6 , cited by the militant group as the reason for the huge ransom demand , was only for humanitarian purposes			1
" i would be surprised if the @entity13 government or @entity2 really pushed forward and released this female suicide bomber as @entity6 has requested , " said @entity0 global affairs analyst @entity109 , referring to @entity110 , whose explosives failed to go off in the hotel attack in which she participated			1
@entity0 law enforcement analyst @entity116 called the swap " a nonstarter , " noting that @entity6 is already holding a @entity13 pilot whose plane crashed in @entity120			1
@entity13 is part of the @entity57 - led coalition that 's conducting airstrikes against @entity6 targets			1
" if there is any bargain going to be struck between @entity13 and @entity6 , it 's going to include their pilot , " said @entity116 , a former @entity126 assistant director			1
@entity132 , the chief executive of @entity134 @entity133 , highlighted the high profile of @entity110 in @entity13			1
" this @entity13 prisoner is probably the biggest terrorist prisoner that @entity13 has , " @entity132 told @entity0			1
" to release her , it 's just going to require , i think , a lot more than just this one @entity2 hostage , " she said			1
@entity29 , 42 , comes across as a lost soul who went to @entity120 last year in search of purpose after suffering a series of setbacks in his life			0
over the past decade , @entity29 had attempted suicide , lost his wife to cancer , and then lost his home and business			0
after changing his first name to its feminine form , he said he believed he was the reincarnation of a @entity159 princess who spied on the @entity2 in @entity160 on a blog , @entity29 once wrote , " i look normal outside , but inside i 'm mentally ill. " but his travels to @entity120 appeared to have been an attempt to rebuild his life			0
he had dreams of setting up private security company			0
it was there that he met @entity23 , 47 , an experienced freelance journalist who frequently reported from war zones			0
@entity23 has a wife and two young daughters in @entity2			0
despite their contrasting backgrounds , the two apparently became friends in @entity120 , with @entity23 helping show @entity174 how to get by in a risky environment			0
after @entity29 was reported to have been captured in august , @entity23 is believed to have decided to go into @entity6 - controlled territory , with finding his friend among his goals			1
@entity29 's father has expressed grief over his son 's apparent killing			2
" i have been praying such a thing would not happen but , unfortunately , it has finally come to pass and my heart aches , " @entity183 said in an interview with @entity2 media			0
" i feel so guilty that mr. @entity23 has been detained and threatened death after he had entered there to rescue my son at the risk of his life , " he added			0
" i wish him to be released and return to @entity2 immediately and continue his activity			0
" @entity23 's mother made a plea to her son 's captors to release him on friday , saying he was n't an " enemy " of @entity6			1
" words fail to describe how i feel , " @entity199 said			0
" @entity23 always has been a kind person ever since he was little			0
he was always saying , ' i want to save the lives of children in war zones			0
' " @entity57 president @entity205 spoke with @entity34 by phone sunday from @entity207 , the @entity204 said			0
@entity205 offered " condolences for the murder " of @entity29 by @entity6 and conveyed " solidarity with the @entity2 people , " according to a statement			1
the @entity213 said in a statement that it strongly condemns the apparent killing of @entity29 , describing it as " a heinous and cowardly act			2
" it demanded the immediate release of @entity66			2
@entity219 prime minister @entity218 suggested @entity2 was right not to bow to the terrorists ' demand for ransom , saying that " @entity219 strongly supports the firm stance prime minister @entity34 and his government have taken			2
" the @entity57 and @entity219 both refuse to pay ransoms to terrorists			0
but other countries , notably @entity230 , have reportedly spent tens of millions of dollars on the release of hostages held by @entity7 militants in recent years , despite denying it publicly			2
@entity2 has also paid kidnappers to free its citizens in the past , according to the @entity237			0
in 1999 , @entity239 handed over $ 3 million for the release of four mining experts held in @entity242 , the newspaper reported			2
opinion : what hostage crisis means for @entity2 @entity0 's @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 contributed to this report .			2
