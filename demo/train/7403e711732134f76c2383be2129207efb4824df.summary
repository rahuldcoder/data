-- most horses at this month 's @entity2 could clear the water jumps			1
plunging head - first into a water feature he had n't even seen , @entity4 lost an entire hoof in the accident			2
luckily , the eight - foot mascot -- @entity4 was named after @entity10 , the @entity11 host province of the @entity2 -- had a spare hoof on hand			1
@entity4 's soaring popularity may have outstripped his jumping capabilities , with replica plush - toy versions almost impossible to find by the end of the two - week games in @entity19 , but there were plenty of contenders ready to demonstrate how water should be handled			2
driving is the sport to pick if you want to see horses navigate water			2
the sport , not seen at the @entity30 , sees teams of four horses pull an old - fashioned carriage through a series of tests to determine a winner			2
the most visually appealing of those tests is the marathon , in which the driver and horses must face a time trial across a course involving miniature mazes , lakes , hills and other hazards			2
the driver is by no means alone : in the marathon , two teammates ride on the back of their carriage , shifting their weight as though riding a superbike rather than a souped - up stagecoach			0
nobody drives a carriage quite like @entity56			1
the @entity57 has now won three world titles in a row , mastering not only the marathon but also the driven dressage ( fancy moves determine how harmonious your horses look ) and the obstacle test ( steer your team through sets of cones , losing marks for any you hit )			1
you can not fault the @entity2 for the variety on offer			1
take a stroll for 10 minutes from the carriage driving and you come to the @entity2 village , an array of shops and stalls with an equestrian theme			1
ambitious spectators could be found heaving saddles around the village having been inspired to impulse buy , while local horses bustled between the shoppers , offering rides or even helping to transport equipment			0
these are the literal workhorses of the @entity2 -- toiling in the comparative shadows while illustrious cousins , some worth tens of millions of dollars , strutted to the beat in packed adjacent venues			1
music is surprisingly integral to much of horse sport			0
dressage , the discipline which tests how well a horse and rider work together through a series of intricate moves , has long culminated in a freestyle routine where rousing music , pitched perfectly and matched meticulously in every movement , can win you a world title			1
but vaulting , too , makes the most of a melody			0
vaulting is gymnastics on the back of a horse , a sport where athletes clad head - to - toe in spandex perform handstands , leaps , cartwheels and more on top of a horse cantering in a 20 - metre circle			0
" music choice is really difficult , " said @entity122 's @entity121 , who defended her vaulting world title in @entity11 this past week			1
" i had quite a struggle trying to find something i could work to , that looked good when i did it			0
" @entity121 ended up settling for a selection from famed @entity11 stage show @entity130 , with musical numbers a common theme among competitors			1
" with it being from a @entity11 musical , for me it brings together the fact that i 'm here in @entity11 , and i can be a bit emotional and bring together all of my vaulting , " said @entity121			1
the atmosphere after she finished ? anything but miserable , as organizers married the finesse and delicacy of equine gymnastics with a bombastic sound system and frenzied announcers			0
hundreds of schoolchildren screamed in unison to welcome each vaulter			0
@entity11 's @entity153 could barely contain her pride as dozens of @entity11 flags waved jubilantly back at her , following her final routine			1
@entity157 knows that feeling , too			0
the @entity11 showjumper shouldered the hopes of the host nation on the final day of the @entity2			1
showjumping takes on a rare format at the @entity2 -- the @entity164 , a contest in which the leading four athletes must master their rivals ' rides to win the gold			1
first , you ride your own horse around a shortened set of jumps , aiming to do so within a specified time limit			0
then , unusually , you must complete the same course on each of the other three finalists ' horses			0
perhaps one of the most embarrassing fates in equestrian sport -- aside from being @entity4 the mascot , stepping soggily from a water jump -- is to mess up the showjumping on your own horse , only to see someone else do a better job of riding the same animal			0
step forward @entity190 's @entity189 , who clattered into a fence on his own ride ( casall ask ) then had to watch @entity195 @entity194 horse whisper his way to a clear round on the same horse			2
the last gold medal of the @entity2 came down to a straight fight between @entity194 and @entity157 , who had overcome the sudden death of his brother @entity203 , earlier in the year , to reach the highest level of showjumping in the world			1
the stage had been set for an emotional victory for the @entity11 , in front of a deafening crowd inside @entity19 's soccer stadium			2
yet one time fault -- the narrowest possible margin -- denied @entity157 the win			0
his fractionally tardy round aboard casall ask ( again the culprit ) saw @entity194 , who went clear on all four horses , add individual gold to his earlier team title			1
a dominant week for the @entity195 ahead of the @entity30			0
if we began with @entity4 , the final word goes to another surprising candidate on four legs : a dog named @entity226 , who set a record at an event for a different species			0
@entity231 , a paradressage rider from the @entity232 , brought @entity226 on the journey as her service dog			0
journey required a special pass to head inside venues with @entity231 , hence becoming the first accredited canine in @entity2 history			2
happily , @entity226 avoided the water jump .			0

the @entity242 took place in @entity10 , @entity11
around *570,000* *people* visited the @entity2
@entity57 @entity56 wins third world title in a row
@entity194 wins two gold medals
