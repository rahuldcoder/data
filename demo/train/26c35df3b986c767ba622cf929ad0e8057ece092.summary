@entity0 , @entity1 -- in front of a mirror , @entity3 sees what is possible			1
there , in the center of her face , is a nearly complete piece of herself -- a piece she 's been missing since the day she was mutilated nearly four years ago			1
since august 2010 , when her image appeared on the cover of @entity16 , she 's been known for what she did n't have			1
her @entity19 husband and in - laws hacked off her nose and ears as punishment for running away			1
her disfigured face became a symbol for oppressed women in @entity27 , a reminder of what might come in spades if the @entity19 regains control			1
today , she is only minor surgeries away from having the new nose she 's longed for			1
the grueling procedures -- involving a painful skin expander in her forehead , as well as skin , bone and cartilage grafts -- are behind her			0
come this summer , for the first time in years , she will appear whole			0
but rebuilding a nose and rebuilding a life are two very different propositions			1
the first involves her being at the mercy of others ; the second demands that @entity3 , 22 , do the work			1
with the end of her face 's transformation in sight , she and the @entity27 family that 's embraced her believe everything else -- an education , a career , independence -- will be possible			1
" she 's a very bright girl			2
and her future is actually in her hands , you know			2
but we are the instrument to coach her			0
... this should be our duty , to show her the right way and the wrong way , " says @entity65 , who serves as her father figure and is facing his own challenges today			0
" there is no limitation for her -- where she can go			0
" @entity2 has been following @entity3 's journey in @entity80 since january 2011 , a year before we were even able to speak directly to @entity3 -- let alone take photographs or shoot video			1
in our initial exclusive piece , we explored her winding , complicated search to find a place to call home			0
her journey began with a few months in @entity89 , where she was supposed to get reconstructive surgery but was deemed too emotionally unstable to handle it			2
she then went to @entity92 , where she stayed for a year under the care of the @entity94			0
there she made progress , with the help of tutors , @entity100 classes and therapy			0
but the support network in @entity92 could n't give her something she 'd eventually claim for herself			0
and after meeting @entity65 , his wife @entity105 and their daughter from @entity105 's first marriage , @entity3 campaigned to join them through months of middle - of - the - night phone calls			1
knowing what she 'd been through , and believing they could give her something no one else could , they opened their doors			0
in late november 2012 , she moved into their @entity117 , @entity1 , home			0
" i suffered a lot in my life , " @entity3 said , as @entity105 translated , days before her first surgery last june			1
" now i feel that a light comes into my life			0
" her surrogate parents , though , are now swimming in their own sea of worries			0
days before @entity127 , @entity65 lost his engineering job with @entity129 , one he 'd had for nearly 30 years			0
and @entity105 , who 'd been an obgyn in @entity131 before moving to the @entity80 to join @entity65 , has struggled to find her way professionally			0
she needs to complete a residency program to practice medicine here , but so far has been unable to secure a spot in a program			2
@entity105 has spent the better part of the last year in @entity92 , away from her family , working at a @entity140 hospital as a house physician -- a low - paying and demanding position open to doctors in her situation -- in hopes it would help her land a residency this spring			2
but for the third year in a row , she came up empty - handed			2
their flexibility as a family , their ability to pick up as a unit and move for work , is limited in part by @entity3 's surgeries			1
she 's being treated for free at the @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity1			2
once her nose is completed in the coming months , doctors will move onto her ears -- a less - cumbersome reconstructive process , but one that will take time			1
her disfigured ears , though , have not haunted her like her nose			1
her dark hair , which flows down to her waist , covers them			0
@entity3 's transformed face , and her sense of peace and comfort in her new @entity1 home , is a testament to her development			1
but as she progresses physically and emotionally , in other respects @entity3 's life is on hold -- teetering between inertia and , at times , regression			1
she 's been living in a protective bubble ever since her surgical process began 11 months ago			2
she 's floated between surgeries and , for the most part , not been engaged with the outside world			1
she , and those caring for her , say she ca n't risk contracting a cold or , worse , an infection			0
as a result , she 's stopped going to her weekly @entity100 classes and barely speaks @entity100 anymore			2
she stays up all night watching @entity193 videos and making jewelry			0
she sleeps during the day			0
@entity65 and @entity105 want to give her space to heal			0
now is not the time to push her , they say			0
soon enough , when her nose is complete , she 'll have no choice but to move forward			1
but what will those next steps look like ? what will her future hold ? no mirror can reflect to @entity205 , or anyone else , those answers			2
if you are interested in making a donation to @entity3 's personal account to support her on her journey , go to the website set up in june 2012 by the family who is caring for her : @entity214 .			1

her @entity19 husband and in - laws cut off her nose and ears as punishment for running away
@entity3 's haunting image appeared in 2010 on the cover of @entity16 , a symbol of oppression
after *multiple* surgeries , her new nose is nearly complete and will make her look whole
but @entity2 's *multiyear* journey with @entity3 shows questions remain about her future
