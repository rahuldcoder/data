@entity0 -- the embattled @entity6 tabloid @entity5 , one of the oldest and best - selling newspapers in @entity6 , will shut down after sunday 's issue , its owner , @entity4 , told @entity1 thursday			1
the dramatic announcement follows accusations that the paper illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terror victims , politicians and celebrities			2
the scandal could have far - reaching consequences and may be politically damaging to prime minister @entity20			1
@entity6 media reported thursday that @entity22 , @entity20 's former director of communications , has been told by police that he should go to a police station to be arrested friday morning over his alleged knowledge or involvement in the mobile phone - hacking practices that took place while he was editor of the @entity5			1
he resigned as editor of the newspaper in january 2007 after the @entity5 royal editor @entity31 and a private investigator , @entity32 , were jailed for intercepting voicemail messages on royal aides ' phones			1
after @entity22 moved to his communications role with the @entity38 , the scandal resurfaced			0
he was questioned by police in november and resigned from his @entity41 position in january , despite the @entity42 ruling that there was " no admissible evidence " to bring criminal charges			0
@entity6 media have reported that @entity22 will be formally questioned on friday under suspicion of involvement in hacking and have speculated that he is likely to be released on bail and appear in court at a later date , alongside other arrested former @entity5 journalists			1
@entity22 has previously insisted that he did not know about widespread phone hacking at the newspaper and offered , last year , to meet with police voluntarily to discuss the case			0
@entity4 chairman @entity56 said thursday , in announcing the shutdown , that the scandal " sullied " the newspaper and " has no place in our company			1
" and paying out - of - court settlements to some victims was " wrong and a matter of serious regret , " @entity56 said			1
he is a son of media magnate @entity67 , the head of @entity69 , which owns @entity4			0
the paper 's roughly 200 employees are now out of jobs , but are free to apply for other positions within @entity4 , the company said			1
" the rug 's being pulled out from underneath our feet , " said @entity75 , political editor at the @entity5			1
" i can only assume he ( @entity56 ) feels the brand has been so badly damaged that the best thing to do is a scorched earth policy and get rid of it			1
but it 's one hell of a decision			0
" the @entity87 condemned the move to shut down the paper			1
" @entity56 was absolutely right when he said in his statement today that ' wrongdoers turned a good newsroom bad			2
' yet those wrongdoers are still there today , at the top of the @entity4 empire and ordinary staff at the paper are paying with their livelihoods , " @entity87 general secretary @entity93 said in a statement			1
the 168 - year - old newspaper , which sells more than 2.5 million copies every sunday , was brought down by an avalanche of public and political fury in the wake of revelations that the hacking victims included a missing 13 - year - old girl who was later found to have been murdered			2
in an interview for @entity6 media , @entity56 said he , his father and the company felt " regret " over what had happened			1
he insisted he was satisfied that @entity117 -- the current chief executive of @entity4 and former editor of the @entity5 who has been the target of calls to step down -- " neither had knowledge of nor directed the activities			2
" he said the company was committed to doing the right thing , by cooperating with police and putting in place a process to make sure such practices did not happen again			0
all revenue from the paper 's final edition will go to " good causes , " he said earlier			2
on wednesday , @entity67 himself called allegations against his flagship sunday paper " deplorable and unacceptable			2
" prime minister @entity135 called the possibility that the hacking had taken place " absolutely disgusting " and backed calls for an independent inquiry into the affair after a police investigation concludes			0
the scandal is potentially damaging to cameron himself because he is close to current and former top officials at the @entity5 's parent company , former @entity144 spokesman @entity143 told @entity1 thursday			1
police launched a special investigation into the allegations of phone hacking on behalf of the newspaper in january of this year			0
it was the second police probe into the issue			0
on thursday , shortly before @entity56 's announcement , police said they have identified the names of nearly 4,000 potential victims			1
@entity149 launched the new investigation this year in response to widespread complaints from high - profile figures who feared they may have been targets			0
but the revelation this week that victims may have included the murdered girl , the families of terror victims and of @entity6 troops killed in @entity172 and @entity173 , raised the scandal to a new level			2
the @entity176 , a top military veterans ' organization , said thursday it was suspending ties with the newspaper after the accusations			0
a flood of advertisers announced wednesday and thursday that they were dropping campaigns with the tabloid			0
prof. @entity188 , at the @entity186 at the @entity187 , told @entity1 it seemed @entity4 had decided the brand was so badly damaged that it made more sense to close the paper			0
but he believes the company will soon launch another paper in its place			2
" i 'm deeply skeptical that this actually means they will not be producing a sunday paper in the near future , relaunched and repackaged -- a sunday newspaper that will do very similar things to the @entity5 , because it 's the biggest selling sunday ( paper )			1
it 's a cash cow that will be subsidizing other papers , certainly @entity205			0
" @entity206 , an analyst at the media research firm @entity207 , said the @entity5 was the " sacrificial lamb being taken out into the desert and killed " in order to try to save the @entity56 empire 's bid to take over @entity6 broadcaster @entity214			1
" it 's a recognition that for whatever reason , the @entity5 was affecting the public perception of the bid for @entity214 and was likely to make it more difficult , so it was easier and cheaper to close it down , " he told @entity1			1
he suggested @entity4 might publish the @entity5 's sister paper , @entity221 , seven days a week instead			1
meanwhile , @entity4 says it is co-operating with the police investigation into the accusations against it , which also include bribing police officers , and has welcomed " calls for a broad public inquiry into standards and practices in the industry			0
" the company is " close to identifying " how the hacking of murdered teenager @entity235 's phone happened , a @entity4 source told @entity1 , declining to be named discussing internal corporate business			1
the revelation that the girl 's phone had been hacked after she was reported missing in 2002 , and that messages were deleted , giving her parents hope she was alive when she had already been murdered , outraged @entity6 this week			1
@entity4 said thursday that if the accusation of hacking into the messages of fallen troops ' families was true , " we are absolutely appalled and horrified			0
" it made similar statements about the @entity235 accusation and the allegation it had targeted the families of people killed in the july 7 , 2005 , suicide bombings in @entity0			0
@entity255 , whose son was killed in the terrorist attack , said wednesday his phone number and home address were found in the files of a private investigator working for the @entity5			2
" we are no longer talking about politicians and celebrities but murder victims , potentially terrorist victims			0
it 's absolutely disgusting what has taken place , " @entity20 said wednesday			1
" i think everyone in this house and country will be revolted by what they 've heard and seen on their tv screens			0
" but @entity20 said the inquiry could not begin until after the police investigation was done , for fear of interfering with it			2
on thursday , @entity0 's @entity149 said they were asking the @entity281 to investigate the possible bribery of police officers by people working for the media group			2
the announcement came a day after the police said they would investigate the case themselves			0
" however , in view of the significant public and political concern expressed following the publication of this information , " police thursday " made a formal referral to the @entity281 , " they said in a statement			0
@entity4 wednesday confirmed it had given police paperwork related to the possible bribery , calling the handover evidence of its " determination as a company to deal responsibly and correctly with the issues			0
" phone hacking involves calling a phone from two other phones at the same time , sending one caller to voice mail			0
that caller then enters the code number to retrieve voice mail remotely			0
hackers depend on the fact that many people never change the default pin for voice mail retrieval			0
the paper has apologized for hacking into the voice mails of celebrities and politicians , paying compensation to actress @entity321 and offering money to others			2
at least five people have been arrested in connection with phone hacking investigations this year since a new investigation , @entity328 , was launched in january			0
private investigator @entity32 and a journalist working for the @entity5 were sent to prison in 2007 for hacking into the voice mails of royal staff in an earlier investigation			1
@entity5 was the first @entity6 @entity334 newspaper @entity67 bought , in 1969 , as he began to propel himself from @entity336 newspaper proprietor to international media magnate			1
in addition to owning @entity5 , @entity4 owns the @entity221 , the @entity205 and the @entity339 in @entity6			1
@entity56 's @entity69 also encompasses @entity340 , the @entity341 , the @entity342 and @entity344 publishers			1
@entity1 's @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 and @entity348 contributed to this report .			2

@entity354 : " ordinary staff at the paper are paying with their livelihoods , " says @entity87 general secretary
@entity6 media report @entity20 's former communications director will be arrested
@entity56 says he and his company feel regret over what 's happened
