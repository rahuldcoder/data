one of my law professors once told our class : i 'd rather be rich and guilty than poor and innocent			0
in @entity11 , in the courtroom of judge @entity7 , not only can the wealthy afford top - notch attorneys and experts , they are afforded their very own legal defense			1
it 's called " affluenza			1
" @entity15 is a 16 - year - old troubled teen who drove drunk and killed four innocent people			1
he lost control of his @entity18 , rolled it and slammed into them as they tried to fix a disabled car on the road 's shoulder in a @entity25 suburb			1
one of his seven teen passengers was thrown from the truck and permanently paralyzed			1
he can only communicate by blinking			0
prosecutors had sought the maximum sentence of 20 years in state custody			1
in court , paid experts on @entity15 's behalf argued he suffered from " affluenza " -- a previously made - up diagnosis not even recognized by the @entity37 -- and that his behavior was excused because of how he was raised			1
opinion : the cure for " affleunza " is prison the theory was that @entity15 was not to blame for his actions because his rich parents gave him too much , never set limits for him , and he never learned consequences for his actions			2
his parents and his family 's wealth were to blame , they argued			2
and the judge 's decision -- despicable			1
@entity15 was not sentenced to a @entity11 juvenile detention center			2
instead , he was sentenced to 10 years probation and is required to enter into a private counseling center to receive one year of rehab			1
the posh @entity61 facility his attorneys have recommended will reportedly cost his parents $ 450,000			0
there is , however , yoga , nutrition courses , horseback riding and cooking classes			0
welcome to @entity15 's world			2
where the same privilege that justified him killing four people allows him to walk away with virtually no consequences			1
the message this case sends about our criminal justice system and personal responsibility is chilling			2
there really are two systems of justice -- one for the rich , and one for those other people			0
there really is a double standard			0
related : @entity88 , is it real ? the purpose of juvenile justice is not solely rehabilitation			0
it 's also to teach young people about accountability and consequences so that they wo n't continue to offend			1
it 's also about punishment when teens kill and hurt others			2
she heard a case last year where a 14 - year - old @entity106 - @entity105 teen punched someone once ; the person tragically died two days later			1
judge @entity7 ruled that the teen could get his services and counseling while sentencing him to @entity11 juvenile detention with the possibility of adult prison for up to 10 years			1
that was for one punch			2
@entity15 drove his truck 70 mph with a .24 blood alcohol content ( three times the legal limit for an adult ) , killed four people , and got 10 years probation			1
the scales of justice are clearly on one side here			0
our juvenile system is full of teens from challenging backgrounds			0
many are born to parents who neglected them , abused them or did n't teach them right from wrong , who in some cases fended for themselves at very young ages			0
but , unlike @entity15 , they do n't suffer from affluenza			2
they are poor and , too often , they are black			0
off to jail they go			0
their backgrounds may offer explanations for their actions , but they do n't justify them			0
so why should ethan 's ? judges often use their sentencing to set an example and send a message			2
if that 's the case , would n't the best cure for affluenza be to deprive @entity15 of his wealth ? humble him			1
not give him special treatment in world - class facilities and reinforce the message that he 's different and not like the rest of us			1
send him to juvenile detention where he can get services , but also protect society by not allowing him the opportunity to kill others			0
justice is not blind in judge @entity7 's courtroom			1
@entity15 is being granted a privileged outcome based on his privileged background			0
and prosecutors should challenge this sentence as outrageously lenient			0
@entity15 is not being held accountable			0
judge @entity7 should be .			0

@entity171 calls judge 's decision in the " affluenza " drunk driving case " despicable "
@entity171 : privilege that justified killing four allows him to walk with virtually no consequences
same judge sentenced a 14 - year - old @entity106 - @entity105 teen to 10 years for punch
