-- while we do n't yet know the full scope of damages inflicted by superstorm @entity5 , it is clear recovery costs in the @entity9 region will be in the billions of dollars			1
according to @entity11 secretary @entity10 , recovery after @entity5 will be " if not the most extensive and expensive , one of the most in our nation 's history			1
" but despite the staggering losses , the region has everything going for it to recover quickly			1
disasters happen all over the world , but their impacts vary greatly , driven by the interplay between the natural environment , economic and social forces , and institutions in each country			2
the 2010 @entity27 earthquake was devastating , killing more than 300,000 people			2
@entity27 is the poorest nation in the @entity29 ; resources for construction are limited and building codes absent			2
recovery has been extremely slow : six months after the quake , about 98 % of the debris remained , making much of capital city @entity36 impassable			2
even two years later , up to 500,000 people were still homeless			2
compared with the death toll of 300,000 in @entity27 , the 1995 earthquake of nearly equal magnitude in @entity41 , @entity42 , killed just 6,434 people			2
the recovery in this highly developed city was incredibly fast			2
many experts in @entity42 predicted that it might take up to 10 years for @entity41 to rebuild and for its economy to fully recover			1
to the surprise of many , in less than 15 months , manufacturing in greater @entity41 was 98 % of its pre-earthquake trend			0
the rubble had been removed within just two years of the quake			0
while wealth is critical in protecting life and capital , other factors are also important : well - developed insurance markets , trade openness that speeds the flow of emergency resources , and effective management in preparing and responding to disasters are also critical			1
the government must be effective in allocating resources and conducting recovery operations			1
research shows that countries with greater local government autonomy are far more effective at protecting people in natural disasters than more centralized government systems because local authorities more familiar with local needs can respond quickly and effectively			1
@entity76 , who studied the @entity41 earthquake , says human capability and the country 's cultural attributes are the most essential elements to quick recovery ; while individuals ' skills are very important , the relationships between people and the ability to work together are essential to community recovery and resiliency			1
@entity76 says : " destroy any amount of physical capital , but leave behind a critical number of knowledgeable human beings whose brains still house the culture and technology of a dynamic economy , and the physical capital will tend to re-emerge almost spontaneously			1
" capital accumulation is especially easy the second time around because the primary goal is to duplicate an investment pattern , not design it from scratch			0
. @entity103 , in which the bomb took a much larger fraction of both human and physical capital , was a bustling commercial metropolis just five years later			0
the @entity110 city of @entity111 , reduced to rubble in @entity113 , did not even bother to remove the debris for some years			0
instead , it moved major sections of the city and was booming again in the early 1950s			0
" although @entity103 lost many people , those who remained still possessed the essential elements needed to stage a recovery			0
of course , the economy suffers in the periods immediately after a disaster			1
in the @entity9 region , flood damages , limited transportation and power outages will continue to hold down productivity			1
but as money from insurance , savings and government begins to flow into the region , economic activity will rebound			1
this is not to say people will necessarily be better off , but they could be in time			0
despite the damages and destruction , there may yet be a silver lining			0
when building and infrastructure are destroyed , superior materials and technology are often used in reconstruction			0
this can improve productivity in the long run			0
people who live in disaster - prone regions tend to invest more in education , an important driver of economic growth			1
disasters also motivate people who might not normally interact with one another to work together to resolve challenges			0
recent research shows how societal trust increases after disasters			0
after @entity164 , city leaders in @entity162 who had disagreed on how to fix the troubled @entity162 school system came together and agreed to replace it with a new structure			0
two - thirds of city schools in 2004 were rated " academically unacceptable " by the state			0
by 2010 , only 4 in 10 were rated that way , and the percentage of students attending a low - performing school had been cut in half			0
the @entity9 region has as all the essential elements required for a quick recovery : one of the most highly educated populations in the world , relatively nimble and autonomous state and local governments , highly developed insurance markets , and excellent infrastructure and trade @entity184 to speed the inflow of resources			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191			1

@entity191 : disaster 's impact depends on where the devastation occured
he says despite staggering loss , @entity9 region has everything going for it to recover
@entity203 : economies suffer in the periods immediately after a disaster
but as money from insurance and government flow into the region , economy will rebound
