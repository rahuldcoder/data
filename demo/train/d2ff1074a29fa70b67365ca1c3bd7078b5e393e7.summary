@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , son of racing legend @entity4 , will have to wait another year to write the family name into the official record book at the @entity8			1
@entity4 's pursuit of the land speed record for a piston engine car -- 439 mph -- was jinxed by rain at @entity8 's annual @entity13 in august , and again at the event intended to make up for the lost time			1
the @entity16 , which tallies the records , announced late sunday that it was raining in @entity8 and that the salt would be too soggy for racing this weekend			0
" bad news , " @entity4 said in a text message			0
" the @entity16 just canceled @entity21 due to rain			0
that 's the end of the season			0
" @entity25 might have ended the 2014 racing season but not the dream , @entity4 told fans in an announcement , which was accompanied by a photo of him looking exasperated			2
" thank you to my amazing team , my faithful sponsors , and all of you for your support over the past year , " he said			0
" the dream is n't dead , and the @entity36 will return to the salt			0
" last month , @entity4 came within 20 mph of the record held by @entity39 , who survived a 370 mph crash last month at @entity41 , another popular racing event			1
@entity4 sought to break 392 mph to set the record for his vehicle class and hoped to be the first to drive a piston engine car 450 mph			1
@entity4 drove @entity36 , named after his father 's record - breaking car , 419 mph during one leg of his race , and reached a top speed of 424 mph			1
but his clutch failed on the return trip , and he fell short of the official record			1
the average speed of the two trips is needed for the record			0
while he ended the season short of the records he chased , @entity4 has now matched the feats of his famous father			2
@entity4 , known as the @entity61 , was the first @entity62 to top 400 mph			0
he went 406.6 mph at @entity8 in 1960 but also broke down on the return trip			1
the following year , rain turned the salt flats into a shallow lake , and @entity4 never held the official record			2
he planned a return to @entity8 to chase the record in 1988 with son @entity3 behind the wheel , but the elder @entity4 was gunned down in the driveway of his @entity1 home that february			1
in 2010 , 50 years after his father 's feat , @entity3 decided to rebuild the @entity36 and renew the record chase .			2

@entity3 , son of racing legend , still chasing land speed record
he would have set record in vehicle class but broke down on return trip
he has come within 20 mph of record for all piston engine cars
rain ends season early ; @entity4 vows to *continue* speed chase
