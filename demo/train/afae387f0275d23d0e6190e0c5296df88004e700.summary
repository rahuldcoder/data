-- a combative debate on thursday between vice president @entity2 and @entity4 challenger @entity3 came down to the issue of trust			1
they challenged each other 's facts and claims and offered starkly different visions for the direction of the country			0
@entity2 achieved his goal of bringing the fight to his @entity4 challenger in battling @entity3 to a draw , boosting the spirits of @entity19 disheartened by president @entity21 's lackluster performance last week in the first of three presidential debates			1
@entity3 made a positive impression with his command of both domestic and foreign policy issues that showed him to be a formidable national candidate after a career of local congressional races in his native @entity29			0
a snap @entity0 - @entity31 poll showed voters who watched thursday 's debate narrowly favored @entity3 over @entity2 by 48 % -44 % , a statistically even result after @entity4 presidential challenger @entity34 scored a clear debate victory over @entity21			1
@entity3 repeatedly said the @entity21 administration has taken the nation in the wrong direction , asserting it has hindered economic recovery and weakened @entity41 influence around the world			1
what would you have asked ? " the choice is clear : a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency or a dynamic , growing economy that promotes opportunity and jobs , " @entity3 said			2
" @entity34 and i will not duck the tough issues , and we will not blame others for the next four years			0
" he also repeated several times , in reference to the recent terrorist attack on a @entity41 diplomatic compound in @entity59 and other @entity61 protests , that " what we are watching on our tv screens is the unraveling of the @entity21 foreign policy			1
" @entity2 called several of @entity3 's remarks " malarkey " and challenged @entity41 to trust their common sense when judging proposals by the @entity4 challengers			1
the tax and entitlement reforms proposed by @entity34 and @entity3 would harm the middle class and favor the wealthy , @entity2 said in seeking to depict republicans as protectors of the privileged			2
" you think these guys are going to go out there and cut those loopholes ? " @entity2 asked about unspecified moves promised by @entity34 and @entity3 to balance broad tax cuts they propose			2
first ever ' @entity84 ' debate on the topic of reforming the @entity87 program for senior citizens , which @entity34 and @entity3 seek to partially privatize , @entity2 referred to a @entity3 proposal to provide partial government payment for seniors in the future to buy private health care			1
" folks , use your common sense			0
who do you trust on this ? " @entity2 asked , saying @entity3 's plan would increase @entity87 costs to recipients by $ 6,000 a year			2
@entity3 disputed the claim , which was based on a proposal that he has since altered			0
the lone vice-presidential debate before the november 6 election pitted @entity2 , 69 , and his almost four decades of experience in national politics against the 42 - year - old @entity3 , a 14 - year congressional veteran who rose to the chairmanship of the powerful @entity109			1
despite @entity2 's more extensive experience , @entity0 polling showed 55 % of respondents expected @entity3 to win the debate , and both campaigns tried to downplay expectations for their candidate ahead of time			1
privately , senior democrats told @entity0 they believed a strong showing by @entity2 could help the @entity19 ticket , but would n't be enough to erase problems created by @entity21 's self - admitted bad debate performance against @entity34			1
complete coverage : presidential debates @entity21 and @entity34 will square off again tuesday in @entity125 and october 22 in @entity126			2
polling after the first presidential debate showed @entity34 tightening the race nationally and in some of the nine battleground states considered vital to either candidate 's chances of garnering the 270 electoral votes needed to win the @entity133			0
" i do think @entity2 did his boss a lot of good tonight , " @entity0 senior political analyst @entity134 said after thursday 's debate			1
@entity0 chief political analyst @entity138 said @entity2 's job " was to right the ship , and he did it			2
" both analysts criticized @entity2 for his tendency to smile and roll his eyes in response to some of @entity3 's comments , especially early in the debate , with @entity134 saying @entity3 won on style but the debate was even with regard to substance			1
@entity2 also was more aggressive in his demeanor , repeatedly cutting off @entity3 and sometimes talking at the same time as his rival to challenge specific comments			2
at one point , @entity3 told @entity2 that " i know you 're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground , but i think people would be better served if we do n't keep interrupting each other			2
" @entity2 responded : " well , do n't take all the four minutes then " in reference to how much time the candidates had to respond to a particular question			0
overall , @entity2 spoke for about a minute more than @entity3 during the 90 - minute - debate			1
@entity4 strategist @entity167 , a @entity0 contributor , said @entity2 " had to buy his boss a week until the next debate , and he did that tonight			1
" " he was n't charming @entity2 tonight , that was n't his mission , " @entity167 said			0
@entity3 repeatedly sought to focus the debate on the @entity21 - @entity2 record of the last four years , arguing the administration 's policies hindered economic recovery and weakened the nation 's standing and influence in the world			1
for his part , @entity2 tried to frame the election as a choice between differing directions for the country by contending policies of the @entity189 ticket would hurt the middle class and move the nation backward on social issues such as gay rights and abortion			0
@entity195 of @entity196 aggressively moderated the debate , challenging both candidates on some claims and moving on to various topics covering both domestic and foreign policy			0
unlike @entity21 last week , @entity2 made sure to mention @entity34 's controversial comments secretly recorded at a may fundraiser in which the former @entity205 governor spoke of 47 % of @entity41 who depend on government benefits and wo n't vote @entity4			1
" @entity34 points out 47 % of the people wo n't take responsibility , " @entity2 said			0
" ... he 's talking about the people that have built this country			0
all they 're looking for is an even shot			0
" in the biggest laugh line of the night , @entity3 conceded @entity34 did n't express the thought exactly as he wanted at the fundraiser , then needled the gaffe - prone @entity2 by saying : " i think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words do n't come out of your mouth the right way			1
" @entity2 immediately responded " but i always say what i mean , " later adding that if anyone thought @entity34 's " little soliloquy on the 47 % " was just a misstatement , " then i think you 're ... i 've got a bridge to sell you			0
" @entity3 , the conservative congressman from @entity29 , criticized @entity21 's administration for its failure to protect four @entity41 killed in the @entity59 attack last month , and for mixed messages about what transpired			1
where they stand : candidates and issues " this @entity239 issue would be a tragedy in and of itself			0
but unfortunately it 's indicative of a larger problem , " @entity3 said , adding that illustrated an unraveling of the administration 's foreign policy			2
@entity2 smiled and shook his head as @entity3 delivered his criticism , then responded that " not a single thing he said was accurate			2
" on @entity252 , widely backed international sanctions pushed by @entity21 and backed by allies have devastated the @entity255 economy , @entity2 said			1
he rejected assertions that @entity21 failed to work closely with @entity258 prime minister @entity257 , and that the @entity41 lacked commitment to a possible military strike to prevent @entity252 from becoming capable of developing a nuclear weapon			2
" this president does n't bluff , " @entity2 said			0
@entity3 , however , insisted that @entity252 was closer now to having a nuclear weapon than it was four years ago , blaming the administration for allowing that to happen			1
he bluntly said that @entity255 must not be allowed to become a nuclear power			0
@entity2 to stump in @entity3 's backyard after debate " this is the world 's largest sponsor of terrorism , " he said			1
" and if they get nuclear weapons , other people in the neighborhood will pursue nuclear weapons as well			0
we ca n't live with that			0
" opinion : @entity3 should speak for the millennials last week , @entity21 was chided for being passive , and polls conducted after the debate indicate the @entity133 race is now extremely tight ahead of the election			1
key surveys indicate that @entity21 and @entity34 are knotted up in the battleground states of @entity286 , @entity126 , @entity287 , @entity29 and @entity288			0
most experts believe that nine swing states will determine the next president			0
