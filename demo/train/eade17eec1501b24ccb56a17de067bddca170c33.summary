-- in " the internship , " co-stars @entity2 and @entity3 share the screen with a somewhat demanding co-star : @entity6			2
the comedy , which hits theaters friday , is about two middle - age watch salesmen who overcome career obsolescence and a complete lack of tech savvy to join @entity6 's internship program in hopes of scoring a job at the giant tech company			1
based on early reports , the movie is also a valentine of sorts to @entity6 , which cooperated with the filmmakers to portray the company in an accurate and flattering light onscreen			1
@entity6 's campus in @entity26 , @entity27 , is shown as an idyllic place where employees blow off steam playing volleyball ( true ) , riding bikes ( true ) and enjoying delicious free food ( also true )			1
@entity6 products appear frequently and favorably throughout the movie , co-founder @entity34 makes a cameo appearance , and the company 's mission is unquestioningly depicted as doing good in the world			1
" i think the reason why we got involved in that is that computer science has a marketing problem , " explained @entity6 co-founder @entity41 at a @entity6 conference last month			1
" we 're the nerdy curmudgeons			0
" the filmmakers approached @entity6 about making the movie after @entity2 was inspired by a " @entity54 " segment on the @entity6 campus , director @entity52 told @entity53			2
a @entity6 spokesperson told @entity0 that the company saw the movie as a good way to expose people to the company 's " do no evil " culture and get more students interested in technology and computers -- a field that faces a shortage of qualified workers			1
all those good intentions aside , " @entity72 " is also an impressive piece of marketing			2
@entity6 says no money was exchanged during the deal with the film 's makers , but the company was nonetheless very involved with the movie			1
@entity6 allowed the film 's cast and crew to shoot for five days at the @entity82 headquarters , using 100 real @entity6 employees as extras			2
the company also provided props and consulted with the director , actors and script writers on what it 's like to be a " googler " ( a @entity6 employee )			1
the company also offered insights into its fabled summer internship program , which accepted only 1,500 candidates this year from more than 40,000 applicants			0
" over two years , we answered their questions about @entity6 products , allowed them to see a @entity103 ( new googler ) orientation , had them speak with our internship programs team to learn more about life at @entity6 , " the @entity6 spokesperson told @entity0			2
@entity6 also gave feedback on the script , including a request to remove a scene in which a @entity6 self - driving car crashes			1
@entity6 says it did n't mind the car being in the movie , but thought that scene was n't appropriate because " the product had n't launched yet			1
product placement most of " @entity72 " was filmed not at @entity6 but on the @entity120 campus of the @entity121 , where the film crew turned a shiny new student commons building into a replica of @entity6 's @entity27 headquarters			1
even so , the @entity6 brand -- @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity130 tablets and so on -- appears extensively throughout the movie			2
( @entity132 , the company 's connected eyewear that 's currently being beta tested , is not in the film			1
) such product placement is increasingly common in @entity137 , which is always looking for ways to defray the escalating costs of film and tv production			0
typically , there are two kinds of product placement : natural and paid			0
when a company pays to get its soda , car or website into a movie , the camera lingers on it lovingly for an extra moment			2
think of the @entity153 car scenes in a @entity155 movie or @entity156 using @entity157 as his search engine in " @entity159			0
" on tv , most of these more brazen product shots are usually thrown in for free as part of a larger ad buy deal			0
" if [ it 's ] blatant and obvious enough that it 's taking you out of the story , there 's a pretty good chance that was a paid placement , " said @entity165 , who was the director of worldwide brand marking for @entity167 in the 1980s and early 90s and started its product placement program			0
but brands do n't always have to pay , especially when their name is as respected as @entity6 or @entity167			1
natural product placement is a more casual arrangement , where a company loans its products free of charge in the hopes of getting some exposure			0
they might provide the prop master on a tv show with gadgets that fit with a character			0
it saves the prop department work because they do n't have to get a legal team involved with clearing the rights needed to mention real brands , and it saves them money that would have been spent renting props			0
however , the companies have no say over how their products are used or worked into the plot			0
@entity167 has a very successful history with this kind of unpaid , natural product placement			0
in the ' 90s @entity205 movie " @entity206 , " the good guys are seen using @entity167 computers , the bad guys pcs. in " @entity210 , " @entity203 ' character is seen opening an envelope from @entity167 that contains a large check after his buddy lieutenant @entity215 invests money in a " fruit company			2
" @entity137 vs. reality " @entity72 " blurs the line between the two types of placement			2
@entity6 did n't pay @entity222 , but in exchange for its cooperation , the filmmakers gave the company some control over how its products were shown onscreen			1
even when companies do n't pay or have agreements that allow them to prescreen scripts or get final approval on how their product is depicted , it 's usually in the studio 's best interest to show a brand in a favorable light			1
" they 'll go out of their way not to say something bad about it because they do n't want a lawsuit , " said @entity165 , whose company , @entity239 , specializes in natural product placement			0
" it 's sort of implicit that this stuff will not be seen in a negative fashion			0
" even makers of 2010 's " @entity248 , " a raw and often unflattering look at the origins of @entity252 and its founder @entity253 , worked with the company on some aspects of the film to sidestep lawsuits			0
@entity6 did n't ask for any changes after seeing a final cut of " @entity72 , " despite a number of deviations from the original script -- and the fact that it sometimes strays from @entity6 reality			1
for example , in the movie the interns are separated into teams that compete in various contests -- including the mythical @entity271 sport of @entity272 -- to win full - time jobs at @entity6			1
the company says this is not actually part of its real - life internship program			0
" it could n't have been more opposite than my own experience , " said former @entity6 intern @entity277 , who now works full time at the company			2
" the whole competitive , mean - spirited facet of the @entity281 did n't resonate with me			0
" in reality , the @entity283 program is less " @entity285 " and more " @entity286 , " with each intern a key part of a tight - knit , collaborative team			0
even so , @entity277 told @entity0 he enjoyed the movie and thinks it accurately captures the excitement and passion of @entity6 's employees			1
" i think that 's it really fun to see the place where you work depicted on the big screen , " he said .			0

@entity6 provides the setting for the new movie comedy , " @entity72 "
the company did n't pay to be in the movie , but it did get a say in how it was depicted
the movie includes references to @entity6 's self - driving cars but not @entity132
co-founder @entity41 thinks the movie will help with computer science 's marketing problem
