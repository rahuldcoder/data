@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 says she can see your dream job and is ready to help you find it			1
unlike traditional career counselors , @entity7 uses her " intuition " to help her clients			1
" i 've been called a clairvoyant and a medium because my skills fit those skills , " says @entity7			1
she says she only amplifies the intuition that each of her clients already has : " you have all the answers you need inside of you and all the gifts you need to make it happen			1
" what she does is much more than just gazing into a crystal ball or reading someone 's palm			0
" i help people first see the big picture , then i bring it down to the concrete baby steps , " she says			1
" everyone needs to have a baby step action plan , or they are paralyzed ... so we break it down			1
" here 's how it works : clients who are usually in some sort of job crisis , laid off or unhappy with their work , get in touch with @entity7 , usually by phone , and give her their date of birth			1
" if you take your date of birth and digit it down to a single number , you come up with the energy of what you have come to be in the world through your path , your work , " she says			2
" i help people see what that means in their life			2
" next , @entity7 meditates about the client 's case and says she has visions of the right career move for her clients			1
" i see images and pictures of people doing their great work in the world , " she says			2
at this point , many people roll their eyes and write @entity73 off -- but she says a better job and a better life await those willing to make the leap			0
" the first step is to understand more about your soul 's mission , " she says			0
" there 's always a deeper story when people are unhappy with their job or they are afraid -- it 's time for a reinvention point			0
" it 's at that point , she says , that people are willing to " pull back and look at the bigger picture of their life			1
" these reinvention points , according to @entity7 , come as part of nine - year cycles			1
she uses numerology to pinpoint where her clients are on those cycles and when it 's time to change she helps people move in a more fulfilling direction			2
" the next step in everyone 's career journey is to a higher expression of their gifts and what they 've come to do in this world , " she says			0
" so it becomes more meaningful work , more financially successful , more fulfilling in that they think they are bringing more of their true self to the world through their work			0
" but she emphasizes that this does n't mean taking a vow of poverty to teach yoga or live on an ashram			0
" here 's the myth : we 're told that either we can pick work that we love and be poor and starve or we can have the job we take for benefits and security and be unhappy , " she says			0
" we 're told that those are our two choices , and that 's not true at all			0
" @entity7 , 59 , made her own career change a decade ago			1
she says she has been aware of her psychic powers since she was a little girl but was reluctant to share them			0
after a career as a journalist and magazine editor , she decided to become a career counselor and use her intuition			2
she has worked with thousands of clients who pay $ 250 for a one - hour session with her , usually over the phone			1
she shares a large house outside of @entity145 , @entity1 , with her husband and teenage kids			0
statues of the @entity149 mingle effortlessly with baseball gear and running shoes			0
@entity7 -- who also hosts seminars and has written a book , " @entity154 " -- says she is booked six months in advance			1
she says that while the current economic downturn is difficult in the short term , it is presenting people with the opportunity to change and find a better career and a better , more fulfilling life			1
" this economy means people who have been unhappy with their job but just took it for the benefits and the paycheck are finally getting shaken out of those jobs , " she says			0
" now they finally get the opportunity to reinvent			0
" now when you laid off and ca n't get a job in your old path , you finally get to go , ' ok , maybe i can take a baby step in a new direction			2
' " she says it 's all about discovering your true passion in life : " when we pick a career from our passion , from our soul 's work , then that always brings us to true abundance no matter how strange or unique or unusual that work may be			2
