-- while their peers were playing video games or panicking about the prom , a group of young whiz kids has been prioritizing medical innovation			1
from @entity8 to @entity9 , these social - minded prodigies are winning prizes at international science fairs , developing medical innovations and picking up advanced degrees in hopes of saving lives			1
here are eight of the most impressive kids from around working towards a healthier tomorrow			1
@entity18 , 18 , @entity19 stem cells are valued for their ability to develop into specialized cells , and have the potential to treat @entity24 , spinal cord injury and other conditions			0
but artificially generated stem cells have short lifespans that limit their medical usefulness			1
@entity18 's award - winning research , which started off as a class project when he was just 14 , identified the genes linked to this cell aging process			1
@entity18 , who will begin studying biology and computer science at @entity36 this fall , hopes that his research can be applied to other cells , and eventually lead to real - world solutions , like treating cancer			1
" cancer is a disease where cells keep growing and growing and growing , " @entity18 says			1
" but if we age cancer and stop its growth , then that 's a potential treatment			1
" @entity48 , 10 , @entity9 , @entity49 it was a trip to the beach that sparked @entity48 's inventing career			1
when his father -- who had suffered from polio -- could not go swimming because of his prosthetic leg , @entity58 , then six , made him a waterproof alternative using an enhanced medical wax coating			1
soon after , he created a small vibrating robot to help his mother clean small spaces			1
it was n't long before the media , and subsequently the @entity9 government , came calling			0
with the government 's supervision and funding , he 's come up with five more inventions since then , including a seat belt that monitors a passenger 's heart rate and alerts the authorities when it 's too high or low			1
since april , he 's been on an international scientific tour with the @entity77 , which has had him attending academic conferences , meeting with researchers , and even attending space camp at the @entity82 in @entity83			2
" i 've learned a lot , but most importantly , i 'm having fun while doing it , " he says			0
@entity86 and @entity87 , 18 and 15 , @entity88 for @entity86 and @entity87 , science is a family affair			2
the daughters of a chemist and a chemical engineer , the two were always encouraged to ask questions and hunt down answers			0
a school project when she was in seventh grade led @entity86 to create " celloidosomes , " three - dimensional structures built out of living cells , which act as a container for other particles			2
she suggests that these capsule - like structures could be used for organ repair and as innovative way to deliver drugs to the body , but anticipates that there could other applications too			2
" i like to think that the celloidosomes is really just one very small pebble in the beach , " she says , " a very small grain of sand in the beach that 's going to be the movement towards bottom - up engineering for medicine			1
" @entity87 , on the other hand , decided to explore elements that could n't be touched : music and emotions			0
her research analyzed brain activity and found that highly complex sounds -- or chaotic noise -- triggered the part of the brain associated with negative emotions , while low - complexity music triggered the part of the brain associated with positive emotions			2
both sisters were recognized at the prestigious @entity137 ( @entity137 ) , but there 's little sibling rivalry at play			2
" i think it 's been really great to see @entity87 blossoming into the young woman , the young scientist that she is , " @entity86 says			1
" i think she 's kind of paving her own journey			2
" @entity146 , 21 , @entity147 , @entity148 while others his age were just getting into the swing of university life , @entity146 , then 20 , had become @entity148 's youngest doctor , four years ahead of schedule			2
since then , @entity146 , now 21 , has been honored with a slew of awards for his community work and medical achievements , and was nominated for an @entity160 for leadership			2
these awards acknowledge not just his obvious precocity , but the time he 's put in outside of the classroom , especially when he was a student			2
on weekends , he was helping under - serviced communities , taking care of patients at a student - run clinic ; during his december holidays , he was volunteering in the labs of rural hospitals , to serve the community and hone his own skills			2
these days , he 's had to cut back			0
he spends most waking hours completing an intensive two - year internship at @entity178 in @entity179 , @entity148 , but he finds time to act as an ambassador for the @entity181 , and set up a trust fund to help youth in developing nations and rural regions get into engineering and medicine			1
" now that i 've started working , it 's harder to balance that , " he says laughing			1
" but as soon as i 've got that balance , i want to get back to the community			0
" @entity192 , 20 , @entity193 , @entity194 @entity192 was likely the only 14 - year - old boy making a difference in gynaecology			1
attending a high school with a program geared towards medicine gave @entity192 the chance to intern at the nearby @entity202 in @entity203 , @entity194			0
there , he was challenged to improve how the vaginal cuff ( the top of the vagina ) is sutured after a hysterectomy			0
typically , the cuff is sewn together with a horizontal stitch to decrease the risk of infection after surgery , but @entity192 suggested that a vertical stitch might be faster			0
when demonstrating his method on a mannequin , he was able to suture the area three times faster than the traditional method			0
it proved so much more effective that the supervising doctor still uses his method today , having nicknamed it the " @entity224			0
" now 20 , @entity192 is studying chemistry at @entity226			0
he hopes to become a surgeon someday , and make a difference in the lives of others			0
" that 's what i love about the idea of medicine , " he says			0
" the fact that you can change so many lives with just your hands			0
" @entity240 , 17 , @entity8 @entity240 was aged just 14 when he started developing an easy early - detection test for pancreatic cancer			1
by the end of the school year , he succeeded			0
the test , developed under the guidance of a @entity248 professor , takes just minutes to complete , and @entity240 claims it is faster , cheaper , and more sensitive than the current medical standard			1
though his invention has yet to undergo peer - review or rigorous testing , it earned @entity240 not only the $ 75,000 grand prize at the @entity137 in 2012 , but also the attention of every major news organization , frequent speaking gigs ( check out his @entity259 here ) , and a seat on " @entity262			1
" it seems the whole world is waiting to see what he does next			0
@entity267 , 19 , @entity268 , @entity269 @entity267 is best known for becoming a qualified psychologist at 16 , but in his eyes , he still has a lot to accomplish			0
" [ i studied ] not only because i wanted to learn more , or i liked the subject -- i have to make this knowledge useful for future , " says @entity267 , who is also an @entity274			0
this is why , for the last five years , he 's been part of a team trying to perfect islet cell transplantation in diabetics -- working to prevent the cells from being rejected by a recipient 's immune system			1
while the team awaits the ok to move from testing on mice to larger animals , @entity267 has more time to dedicate to " @entity289 " ( the @entity290 ) , a group that pushes for the early identification and support of gifted children , where he serves as head of psychological research			0
he hopes his internationally recognized work will spread awareness about gifted kids , and equip them to make the most of their potential , as he has .			0

we look at eight of the world 's most impressive young medical *pioneers*
