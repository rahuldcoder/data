" there 's an unfinished job of trying the war criminals , " said @entity10 , who was in @entity23 on business when the demonstrations started in february			1
he joined as quickly as he could , camera in hand , documenting his experiences along the way for six weeks			1
" i was here for 20 years in @entity2			1
now that my family is settled and my kids have grown up , my lifelong dream has been to go back to @entity6 and see that justice is done			1
the time has come now , " he said			2
the @entity40 protests , named after a @entity23 neighborhood , center on that brutal nine - month war in which @entity10 and other @entity6 fought for independence from @entity45			1
when one of the top officials in the opposition @entity50 party , @entity51 , was sentenced to life in prison for war crimes on february 5 , protesters demanded a death sentence			2
( since then , violence has escalated as other war criminals received death sentences , and @entity50 supporters launched counterprotests			2
