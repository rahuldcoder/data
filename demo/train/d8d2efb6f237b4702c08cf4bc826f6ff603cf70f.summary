-- " if you give me @entity3 , i want to give it back to the people			1
" @entity5 , the 30 - year - old globetrotting @entity6 street artist , could well say the same about the slums of @entity8 or the favelas of @entity10 , where he has created large - scale projects			1
known for his black - and - white portraits , poster - sized or much larger and pasted on public walls , streets , grounds , rooftops and even trucks , @entity5 considers himself an " urban artivist " -- i.e. , an artist who is an activist			1
in @entity20 earlier this month , he invited passersby to get their portraits taken and pasted on the ground at @entity3			1
equipped with a photo booth truck that instantaneously printed 36 " x53 " posters , his crew recruited volunteers -- some of whom held a large broom / brush and very sticky glue -- to help add the next portrait to the mosaic of faces			1
the line stretched long as endless numbers of tourists , @entity20 and the curious waited for hours to get a piece of the action			1
nearly 6,000 portraits were taken over three weeks			0
the @entity3 project stemmed from an initiative that @entity5 launched in 2011 when he won the prestigious @entity45			1
prizewinners get to make a wish and his was to start a global participatory art project			1
so was born " @entity60 , " which invited people all over the world to submit portraits , share a statement of what they stand for and paste the posters in a public space in their home cities			1
to date , the project has printed and sent more than 130,000 posters to their subjects in more than 100 countries			2
@entity5 is drawn to impoverished and conflict - ridden regions , bringing attention to faces and people that most would easily ignore or forget			1
he goes to the poor , the repressed , the hungry and the invisible and gives them art in the form of portraits			0
those on the receiving end feel , if only momentarily , joyful and proud			0
" art is not meant to change the world , but when you see people interacting , when you see an impact on their lives , then i guess in a smaller way , this is changing the world , " he said in an interview with @entity0			2
" so , that 's what i believe in			0
that 's why i 'm into creating more and more interactions			0
" unlike most visual artists , @entity5 has no qualms about embracing technology			1
his medium may be archaic -- ink , paper , glue -- but he leverages the power of social media by inviting all to participate , upload , comment and share in what he likes to call the " people 's project			1
" he has a @entity104 fan page , a @entity106 account and is most active and at home on @entity108 , where he shows what he 's working on and relates to participants by liking their portraits			0
yet when it comes to his personal identity , @entity5 prefers anonymity			1
he has never revealed what his initials mean nor given out his real name			0
and he always wears dark glasses			0
he wants his art to be about others , not him			0
" even when i do really big pieces , i do them strips by strips -- so you have to paste , you have to involve people			2
it 's a whole process			0
for me , that 's where the artwork is			0
but i use technology more and more , because that 's a great way to share , that 's a great way to be in touch with people			2
it 's just a great way to do something and spread it to millions of people through the @entity139			2
" but is interaction enough ? one fan asked : what 's artistic about @entity5 's work ? another wondered if @entity5 's posters too much resemble advertisements , especially in image - saturated cities like @entity20			1
@entity5 has a response : " i see this project as a social experimentation ... how people see themselves			1
... and you see that sometimes -- they 're like yeah , i want to paste it there ! -- to show part of the community or people from different parts of the world			2
or someone comes out and says -- oh hey , i want to be at @entity3 ! i want my face up there -- and they have no message			1
some people ask me if i like that or not			2
i ca n't like it or not			0
for me , it 's a reflection			0
i have to observe it and study it			0
" some people reveal themselves in the portraits by just being visible			2
others reveal themselves by being incredibly expressive			0
the intentions of the portrait subjects vary as much as the responses they elicit			0
to be fair , many of @entity5 's projects have taken place in far - flung parts of the world where people do n't have easy access to print photographs			1
in the documentary , " @entity60 : the @entity193 's @entity192 , " screened at the @entity189 and debuting on @entity190 on may 20 at 9 p.m. et / @entity191 , we see the track of @entity5 's career , from his start as a graffiti artist in the backstreets of @entity199 to his more recent projects in earthquake shattered @entity202			1
director @entity203 shows @entity5 's work in the context of its environment , and underlying it is a consistent strand of social justice and political activism			1
in " women are heroes , " eyes and faces of women cover the rooftops of houses in the @entity218 slum in @entity8			2
seen aerially , the haunting group of eyes seems to call out to the heavens for help , for relief			0
in " @entity227 , " monumental portraits of @entity224 and @entity225 in the same professions were pasted next to each other on both sides of the @entity230 and in nearby cities			0
most people could n't distinguish the @entity224 from the @entity225			2
in one of the most powerful scenes from the @entity190 documentary , @entity5 's cohort of photographers stealthily pasted portraits of ordinary tunisians in a public square in the middle of the night			1
when day broke , people started tearing them down			2
it seemed @entity245 , who just went through a revolution and deposed their longtime president , @entity249 @entity248 -- whose huge posters used to be everywhere -- were not ready to accept any other large portraits in their public spaces			0
for the crowds in @entity3 , maybe the portrait was about a moment in the spotlight			1
for the @entity245 , it was altogether something else			0
portraits are powerful in their ability to evoke vastly different responses			0
it just depends on where you are and who you are .			0
