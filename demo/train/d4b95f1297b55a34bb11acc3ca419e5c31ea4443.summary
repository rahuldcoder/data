@entity0 -- dr. @entity2 vividly remembers the opium dens			1
fifty years ago , they lined the street just down from his small @entity0 clinic			1
it was the time just before independence in 1965 , before the shiny skyscrapers , velvet freeways and almost - painfully spotless streets			1
many of his patients were addicts struggling to unhook , he writes			2
many would not come to the clinic			0
he had to go into the dens to find and treat them			0
" it was hard treating them in the pitch darkness , " he recalled			0
" i had to call out their names and they would call out to me			0
i would then give the injection , but i never really knew for sure who exactly i was treating			0
" @entity2 's gritty memories have been captured as part of a unique , crowdsourced history project that @entity0 has commissioned ahead of its 50th anniversary of independence in 2015			1
the goal of the @entity32 is not to produce a slick history			1
" we 're not going for certain types of people , " said @entity32 director @entity34			1
" what we 're looking for is specificity			0
it 's the messiness of it , of the lives people lived and the communities they lived in , that we want to have			2
" so far , @entity0 have sent in more than 400,000 memories -- including text , audio , still images , even e-books and video uploaded to the project 's website or through a free @entity54 app available on @entity55			1
with the support of 120 partner groups and 130 volunteers , the project hopes to record 5 million @entity0 , virtually everyone in the country			1
before the economic boom along @entity0 's shoreline in the years after independence , fishermen would lay their morning catch on the beach where vendors from the nearby " hawker " stands would buy fish to serve at their small , hot food shacks , recalled @entity73			1
today , that site is home to a row of terrace houses			0
" everything is gone , " @entity73 said			0
" it was so long ago			0
" it was only the 1960s , the 1970s			0
but in @entity0 , that was another eon			1
in 1965 , the year of independence , @entity0 's per capita gdp was $ 516			1
last year , it was about $ 60,000 -- among the top five in the world			0
that mammoth growth has dramatically transformed @entity0 's landscape in just a few short decades , from rows of hardscrabble fishing shacks and bungalow neighborhoods to a towering glass , steel and concrete wonderland of efficiency , wealth and dazzle			1
little remains of what was there just a short time ago : many of the houses , the stores , the neighborhoods and the communities have been transformed			0
@entity106 , 17 , only remembers today 's booming @entity0			1
as a volunteer for the @entity108 , @entity109 and two other students are interviewing seniors along a just a few streets for a small book of interviews titled " streets we remember			0
" @entity106 said he is learning more than he ever did in school about @entity0 's history from people like @entity73			1
" you start talking about their memories , and they just open up , " @entity106 said			2
" looking at this personal history , it 's more authentic			1
" @entity0 schools , he said , teach history as a blanket of facts , figures , dates and places			1
but he said it 's actually more like a patchwork quilt , something that he and his fellow students hope to capture for the @entity32			1
all the memories collected have fallen into two broad categories : individual recollections about @entity0 ' communities , their friends , their schools , the way they were			1
the other are collective memories -- the experiences and objects that nearly everyone shared			1
big and small memories @entity152 was 11 years old in 1961 when a massive fire tore through his neighborhood , @entity0 's @entity156 squatter settlement , destroying some 2,000 homes			1
" dark billowing smoke filled the sky , the smell was toxic , " @entity152 recalled in his @entity108 blog post			2
" people were screaming and shouting ' @entity163 , @entity163 ' ... i had never seen a big fire that burnt down houses and places before			0
i had not read about it , or watched it on television ( monochrome tv broadcast in @entity0 only began in april 1963 ) or at the movies			1
he described a feeling of " excitement rather than a fear of danger			0
" " my mother and i ran as fast as we could as we fled from the burning houses , " @entity152 said			0
" there was a stampede			0
the older and weaker people were carried by younger and stronger ones			0
" the @entity186 fire left four dead and thousands homeless and is one of those moments in @entity0 's history where most people alive at the time remember where they were when they learned about the massive blaze			1
other memories focus more on @entity0 's rapidly evolving culture , including one e-book focusing on the traditional games children played , arranged by clicking on alphabet letters made to look like children 's blocks			1
another e-book covers the playgrounds that have been swept away by the city - state 's rapid development			1
@entity204 , 17 , and two of her fellow students compiled the memories of people living in the @entity210 complex that is slated to be torn down in 2016 to make way for a new expressway			2
many residents have lived there for decades , and neighbors were like family			0
one resident told @entity204 the story of a birthday party some boys held years ago on an open deck , and how all the neighbors came down			2
" what struck me the most was the sense of family , " @entity204 said			0
" all the people i talked to mentioned the bond			0
now , you do n't know your neighbors			0
it 's not as it was before			2
but it is possible to have a sense of neighborhood			0
it 's just a matter of making time			2
" @entity234 recalled fond memories of growing up watching her grandmother use a bucket instead of a cash register at the @entity240 sauce factory			2
" inside , my father , uncle and one hired worker would sit on small stools or on the floor , hard at work six days weekly making chilli , tomato and soya sauces , bottling them and tying the bottles expertly with thin rope - like twine in packs of six or 12 , " @entity234 wrote in her @entity108 post			2
" @entity255 sold sauces at the ground floor shop while the rest were sold to other businesses			0
all her takings were kept in an iron pail on a pulley			0
she just pulled the rope down , put in the money and the pail went up			0
" a generation 's gift @entity0 's @entity32 is about a country getting personal with itself , and project director @entity34 said most of the posts are " very emotional			1
" " there 's a lot of longing in all the memories -- longing and attachment to people who are gone , places that are gone , " he said			1
but he said there 's also celebration about the stability that @entity0 enjoys today			1
" there 's a great sense of relief of where we are today , " @entity34 said			2
in the process , the @entity32 staffers say , they are learning things about themselves that they never expected			2
they thought the project was about talking to others , about something external			0
but they 've realized that documenting @entity0 's history is about them , too			1
" we started out with a lot of arrogance , " @entity34 explained			0
" we started with an intent to hack into other people 's memories			2
what 's humbling is there 's nothing to hack into , but only things to discover			2
" @entity0 is a young country that has packed more history into its few years than most others			1
but in a place where most everyone came from somewhere else , the @entity32 is helping define what it means to be @entity0			1
it is bringing texture to the life of the nation , endowing a diverse people with a common identity , a way to look forward together			0
the submissions also make for astonishingly interesting reads			0
" this is the gift of our generation , " @entity34 said			0
" history is not just for the leaders			2
it 's about random people , too			2

@entity0 is using crowdsourcing to compile its recent history
the city - state will celebrate 50 years of independence in 2015
it 's calling on all citizens to upload memories to its @entity32
@entity0 have shared memories in *photos* , blog posts , e-books and videos
