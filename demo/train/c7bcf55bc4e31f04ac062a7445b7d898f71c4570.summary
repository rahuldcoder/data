@entity0 -- there are dozens of get - well cards on his wall			2
on his bed , there 's another pile from family , friends , high school pals			1
the patient must be 19 or 20 -- a kid -- and his smile is magnetic			2
his mother hugs every visitor , strangers like us included			2
" i 'm a hugger , " she explains			2
his girlfriend is by his bedside too , wearing a sweatshirt from her college in @entity27 , her studies interrupted			2
" my leg will never be a hundred percent , " he says , " which means i just have to get a new hundred percent			2
" it helps that we were visiting this wounded soldier at @entity33 , a few weeks ago , with the actor @entity34 , instantly recognizable from tv and movies			1
@entity34 is profoundly good - natured and can make anyone smile , even the maimed young men and women , just back from a combat zone they carried home with them			2
but this particular soldier / kid is happy anyway			0
happy to be alive , mature enough to be grateful			0
a few weeks earlier , an @entity46 soldier he had known for eight months -- a man who fought by his side -- turned his rifle on his @entity51 " allies " and killed two of this soldier 's buddies , wounding three , including him			1
this kid knows he 's among the lucky ones			1
" i have no idea why he did it , " he says			0
" it 's the @entity61 , " i reply			1
" i guess so , " he says with a sigh			0
in room after room , our delegation encounters stories of war that are just not a part of the national conversation			1
i keep thinking : whatever happened to the telling of these stories in @entity51 ? do we need a @entity74 lobbyist to push the soldier 's - story agenda ? individual tales make up the reality of war ; anecdote by anecdote , they become the truth of combat			1
but in the @entity51 mainstream media , they have too little presence			1
how did we get to a place where sharing a soldier 's narrative or reading soldiers ' names on television or meeting their coffins when they are brought back to their country becomes a political or disloyal act ? why ca n't we share the truth about war ? when i was growing up in @entity101 , we saw scenes from military funerals on the news : screaming , crying mothers and all			1
wounded soldiers would be interviewed , sometimes with burned bodies or missing limbs			1
it was not political ; it was just the subjective , human reality of the soldier			0
there was a need to know			0
it gave our warriors a public stage from which to reconnect			0
i remember coming back from @entity116 when i was a soldier in the ' 80s , feeling like i 've just been to another planet			0
filmmaking , storytelling , was my therapy			0
we made an earlier trip to @entity33 , along with our lead @entity124 , to immerse ourselves in the lives of returning soldiers in preparation for making a movie about casualty notification officers , the soldiers who knock on the door to bring the grim news of a loved one 's death while on military duty			1
we think of it as an uplifting movie about getting back to life			0
when we tell these troops about our movie , most smile bitterly ; they know their families were spared that awful encounter -- they got a phone call -- but they imagine their friends ' families having their hearts ripped out by two soldiers in @entity150 uniforms at the door			1
" the secretary of the @entity153 regrets to inform you ... " visiting a military hospital is always an inspiring , shocking , beautiful , complicated experience			1
it 's a gift to the soldier , and it 's a blessing for the visitor			2
those who are in good enough shape to talk take us to the front lines of @entity166 and @entity167 in vivid , visceral detail			0
we feel privileged to hear their voices crack , to see their eyes fill with tears			0
if these guys can live through it , we can listen			0
it does n't take much before you 're reminded that wars are about human beings -- on both sides			0
with more than 5,000 dead ; more than 35,000 soldiers coming back with injuries , many that will last a lifetime ; with one in six returning soldiers afflicted with post-traumatic stress disorder ; and with families torn apart by multiple deployments , domestic violence , substance abuse , divorces , suicides , homelessness , etc. , we are slowly transitioning into the longest part of the war : the aftermath			1
there are many dedicated professionals and volunteers who are dealing with these issues			0
they 're the ones who will be learning the soldier - stories that we all must know , the individual accounts that should allow us to address , head - on , our collective responsibility as a society toward those who fight in our name			1
but we wo n't hear these stories unless we insist			2
instead , we 'll get more statistics , political punditry , screamers trying to pull us left or right			0
we say goodbye to this kid in his military hospital bed			1
he waves and says , " no need to worry about me			0
" which is the only thing i think he got wrong			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .			1

@entity239 says soldiers ' stories tell war 's truth , but media often avoid them
he says visiting soldiers in a military hospital is inspiring , not pretty , but *important*
listening to soldiers ' experience lets society *confront* its responsibility in war , he says
