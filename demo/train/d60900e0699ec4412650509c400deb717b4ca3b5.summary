-- looking at the world 's most beautiful women , from actresses to musicians to models , @entity1 wanted its users to consider one thing above all else : would you date them ? @entity1 released its list of the " @entity11 " tuesday , based on the results of polling both readers and office staff			1
while editor - in - chief @entity17 agrees that it 's not as easy to qualify a woman you 've only seen on tv as a potential girlfriend , the list is n't just made up of gorgeous models			1
" looks are obviously a big one for guys -- there 's no question about that -- but other factors are where a woman is in life , the kind of career she 's in and the success or ambition that reflects			2
sincerity and loyalty , all of those values that guys appreciate			0
we ask them to try to really assess the candidates as prospective girlfriends and rank them according to that			0
that 's what really distinguishes the list from a straight - up ' hot women list			1
' " " @entity53 's " @entity50 nabbed the top honors and , at age 39 , is the " most senior no. 1 we 've had , " @entity17 said			1
" seeing her in the show 's family context contributes to that desirability perception and those very criteria that we ask users to judge them by , " he said			2
" there 's no question that she 's hot			2
she does lots of interviews where she 's funny and charming and seems easygoing -- all of those personal characteristics that guys prize in women			1
it seems like there is a sincerity there too , and that 's a huge thing for guys in relationships			2
" while models have their fair share of representation on the list , a few surprises also sneaked into the top numbers			0
@entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 made up the rest of the top 10			1
while @entity96 's @entity95 models are enjoying more visibility these days because of increased tv specials , @entity17 does n't believe they 're at the same level of supermodels from the ' 80s and ' 90s , like @entity102 and @entity103			0
noticeably absent were @entity104 and @entity105			1
@entity17 believes men are " fatigued " by the two actresses			0
@entity104 's private , reserved life makes her too much of a mystery without allowing insight into her personality , while @entity105 has never performed well on the list , @entity17 said			1
newcomers like @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , and @entity118 edged standbys from past years aside			0
@entity120 outranked @entity121 at no. 36 , while @entity121 dropped to no. 97			0
former child stars are also being perceived as the mature young women they 've grown into , like @entity124 and @entity125 , ranked respectively at @entity126 and 17			1
@entity127 , making the list at no. 11 , beat her sister , @entity129 , by a long shot			0
the younger sibling barely made the list at no. 98 , but @entity17 believes that may be a reflection of the new voting system			0
the voting , which began in october , lasted just over six weeks , with an initial pool of 170 candidates			0
users ranked their top 10 on a personal list , and each woman received points for being added to a list , as well as her ranking on the list			2
the results created one list of 99 candidates			0
@entity1 's staff also conducted an internal vote , and the two lists combined represent the final product .			1

@entity50 tops @entity1 's 2012 list of most desirable women
@entity83 and @entity84 ranked second and third
@entity104 and @entity105 did not make the list this year
