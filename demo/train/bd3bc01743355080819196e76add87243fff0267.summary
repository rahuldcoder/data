@entity0 , @entity1 -- for weeks , @entity1 have been holding a vigil for their first democratically elected president , @entity4			1
the 94 - year - old statesman has been lying in a hospital in @entity7 for more than a month			0
away from the capital , in the rolling farmlands where @entity4 was born and raised , many @entity1 believe his precarious condition has been adversely affected by a messy public dispute between members of his family			1
" some of us believe it could be that the suffering [ @entity4 ] is enduring in the hospital at the moment has to do with the fact that his dispute has not been resolved , " said @entity15 , a lawmaker as well as the president of the @entity17			1
" we believe that our ancestors through their spirits are looking after us , " @entity15 added			0
" when we displease them , they bring calamity ; all sorts of discomfort to the family			1
" the family dispute erupted into full public view last week when one of @entity4 's daughters took one of his grandsons to court , after accusing him of secretly moving the remains of three of @entity4 's buried children from the family cemetery in 2011			1
@entity44 embraced her attorney when she won the case in a regional high court in @entity1 's @entity48			1
" it 's a private matter , " was her only comment to the media at the court			2
the next day a sheriff used heavy metal pincers to snap open the padlock on a gate at the village of @entity4 's grandson , @entity57			1
@entity1 authorities retrieved three coffins and bought them for reburial in @entity61 , the small village where the former president maintains a modest home			2
" i still feel that it was a premature act , " said @entity64 , in an exclusive interview with @entity2 on wednesday			0
" the issue should have been exhausted through internal structures of the family and unfortunately that was n't seen , " he added			0
the 39 - year - old grandson was speaking on a windy hilltop in the village of @entity0 , where he had just distributed blankets to several dozen elderly men and women			0
the crowd began the ceremony by reciting prayers			0
later , some elderly women sang and danced in gratitude after receiving their donations			0
@entity64 is a chief , or traditional ruler , in this poverty - stricken corner of @entity1			2
in this deeply traditional heartland , there are other prominent community leaders who agree that the @entity4 family should have turned to distinctly @entity1 methods of mediation to solve their dispute , rather than @entity94 - style courts			1
" if the people are going to abandon the roots to which @entity4 belongs and go and hang on to the branches of a foreign tree , such as the westernized courts , then there is going to be a problem , " said @entity15			2
the @entity4 family dispute has exposed differences between the culture and values of rural black @entity1 and the country 's modern legal and medical system			1
some here argue it is unnatural and unfair to keep an ailing man alive with modern medical machines			0
others fear @entity4 may suffer longer in hospital , because the remains of his three children were moved without accompanying prayers			1
" there was no ritual that that was performed when the bones were moved , " explains @entity117 , a 25 - year - old agricultural university student			0
" the old people are saying you need to consider the spirit and the spiritual being , not only the bones			0
" though raised in @entity61 , @entity4 migrated as a young man to @entity1 's largest city @entity128 , where he eventually opened the country 's first black law firm			1
@entity4 then spent the bulk of his adult life , either imprisoned by the former apartheid regime or struggling in freedom to establish democracy in @entity1			1
over the last decade , he retired from public view and chose to move back to the land of his childhood			0
traditional community leaders like @entity15 cite that as proof that @entity4 wished to return to his roots			2
" he straddled both worlds , the @entity1 and the western , " said @entity15			2
" this man was a traditional man , " he added			0
" and in the twilight of his life , he should be allowed to be who he was			0

in @entity1 's heartland many believe @entity4 's condition *harmed* by family dispute
dispute over burial site of three @entity4 children was settled in court
traditionalists say @entity1 methods of mediation should have been used to solve the dispute
one said : " when we displease [ our ancestors ] they bring calamity "
