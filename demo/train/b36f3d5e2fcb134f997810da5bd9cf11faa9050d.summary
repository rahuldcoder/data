the sight of dr. @entity1 , a victim of the ebola virus , walking from an ambulance to the @entity4 in @entity5 in his hazmat suit may become an iconic photo of modern @entity9 history			1
@entity1 served the poor and infirm and put his own life in jeopardy serving patients in @entity14 , so you would think that he would be received as a hero , admired for his work , and held up as an example of the highest calling of his profession and his religion			0
the same is true of his colleague , @entity9 @entity14 volunteer @entity23 , who just arrived in the @entity9 for treatment			1
but not everyone seems to think so			0
the @entity26 in @entity5 has received hate e-mails and phone calls			2
an op - ed in @entity30 questions who made the decision to bring @entity1 home , and social media is abuzz with demands that @entity37 victims not be admitted to the @entity9 at all			1
the @entity38 proclaimed " @entity37 fear is going viral " and quoted one of @entity41 's tweets : " @entity37 patient will be brought to the @entity9 in a few days -- now i know for sure that our leaders are incompetent			1
@entity47 out of here ! " this kind of reaction is , unfortunately , nothing new for the @entity9			2
the @entity9 has a history of irrational panic over disease and other perceived dangers , of behaving badly about them and then feeling remorseful later			1
perhaps it all started with the @entity57 witch trials , which became the template for similar panics throughout our history			0
@entity37 is here : 5 reasons not to panic the @entity9 fear that an epidemic was corrupting our health , our morals , or our children has inspired movements to ban the waltz , rock and roll , romance novels , comic books , and @entity75			1
of course , unlike dancing or computer games , disease really can cause epidemics and threaten our health and our lives			0
early in an epidemic , especially of a new disease , we are often unsure of the cause , the mode of transmission , or the degree of contagiousness of a disease			0
what is the risk of catching @entity37 on a plane ? but even when we know the nature and cause of a disease , irrational panics still seem to grip us			2
as an issue of the @entity104 lamented , " when the public fears contagion from a dangerous disease , all unselfish considerations and regard for anything except personal safety are often forgotten			0
" the quote is from an article in 1910 , and refers to the public 's fear that cancer was contagious and belief that people with the disease should be isolated and shunned			0
it seems , a century later , we have still not learned our lesson			0
" @entity124 hysteria " became a familiar term in the late 1980s , and despite scientific certainty over its mode of transmission , a 1986 poll by the @entity120 found that 50 % of the adults surveyed supported a quarantine of @entity124 patients , 48 % approved of identity cards for people who tested positive for the antibody to the virus , and 15 % favored tattooing @entity124 victims for easy identification			1
like @entity37 , @entity124 is not spread casually			1
but also like @entity37 , @entity124 was first associated with a minority population feared by many in the majority			1
infection seems somehow all the worse when spread by those we fear or disdain			0
what to know about @entity37 the stories of cruelty and lack of compassion for those who suffered from @entity124 are well documented and relegated to the history of @entity9 shame			1
yet the compassionate treatment of the sick is a fundamental tenet of all the major religions , @entity151 and @entity152 , and forms the moral basis of the @entity9 medical and public health systems			1
@entity9 citizens , especially those who become sick through service to the needy in other parts of the world , need to know that @entity9 stands ready to welcome them back and to care for them as best we can			1
we know exactly how @entity37 is contracted and how it spreads			2
we have perfectly safe procedures to keep it contained			0
despite the severity of the outbreak in @entity167 , @entity37 is not spread quickly like the flu or a cold			2
it involves contact with bodily fluids that are easily contained with the proper precautions			0
@entity9 hospitals deal with such infectious diseases every day -- in fact , the ebola virus has been in research labs all over the @entity9 for years without an incident of infection			2
visitors to the @entity9 have brought other @entity167 hemorrhagic fevers like @entity37 with them , and have been discovered and treated here			1
how many cases have these infectious visitors -- who were not in hazmat suits and isolation rooms -- spread to other @entity9 ? none			2
there are two epidemics in the world today			0
the first is a troubling spread of the ebola virus in poor countries in @entity167 , an outbreak that is the result of poverty , inattention by those countries ' political leaders , and a general lack of concern by the wealthier nations about epidemics that do n't yet seem to directly affect them			0
but the second epidemic is a more dangerous one			0
it is a spreading lack of compassion , characterized by disaster fatigue , helplessness in the face of war refugees , intolerance for immigration , and now , the desire to ban even @entity9 citizens who are sick and need our help			1
the second epidemic seems harder to contain than the first , but it is every bit as important .			0

@entity41 , *bloggers* , op - ed *writers* say we should keep @entity9 with @entity37 out
@entity225 : after putting lives on the line , infected @entity9 should be treated as heroes
@entity225 : panic , fear drive *discrimination* , hate . we should have learned from @entity124 hysteria
he says we show no compassion in wanting to ban sick @entity9 who need help
