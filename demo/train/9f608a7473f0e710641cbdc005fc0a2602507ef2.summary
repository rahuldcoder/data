-- seeing the images of the mangled wreckage of an aircraft after a crash is difficult for any flight attendant			1
it is hard to comprehend that this mass of charred metal , broken seats , bits of galleys and cabins , and the piles of personal belongings , was once our office in the sky			0
this was our workspace -- and our home , for however many hours			0
it was a place where we felt safe as we served meals and drinks , carried out safety - related duties , and caught up with our colleagues and friends , laughing and joking about all the latest gossip on " @entity28			1
" for an airline to suffer two unspeakable tragedies in just four months is beyond comprehension			2
twenty - one @entity33 flight attendants and six flight crew have been lost , after the still unexplained disappearance of flight mh370 and the shooting down of @entity39			1
it is a testament to the carrier 's staff that the airline is still operating a full schedule of flights			0
it is difficult to imagine how the crews left behind are still managing to put on their sarong - style uniforms , paint on a smile and go about their duties as normal , after losing so many of their friends and colleagues			2
to show our solidarity , one week after the loss of @entity39 , flight attendants everywhere are pinning a small black ribbon to their uniform ; to remember our newest angels of the sky			1
can we carry on ? recently , i have been contacted by many crew members who are unsure if they can continue their flying careers			2
unfortunately , there are no words of wisdom for them , no way to take away the pain or the fear many feel over a disaster like this			0
many crew feel it is their duty to keep flying ; a tribute to our fallen colleagues who never made it home ; to keep doing the job they loved and doing it to the best of their ability			1
i know a number of flight attendants and pilots who have been involved in accidents			1
some have managed to return to the skies , others have hung up their wings for good			0
some have used their experiences to improve safety in the industry , helping to ensure tragic incidents are as rare as humanly possible			0
the thought crosses our mind every day when we board our aircraft : " what would we do should the worst happen ? " it 's part of our job to think this way			0
despite many people 's belief that we are there just to serve tea and coffee , or to act as a verbal punching bag when something goes wrong , the primary reason we are on board is safety			0
every take - off , every landing , every pre-flight briefing , we run through our emergency procedures in our heads			0
how would we deal with a decompression ? an evacuation ? a ditching ? a medical emergency ? thankfully , most of us will never have to deal with these events or use the weeks , sometimes months , of training we 've had to save lives			2
sadly , the crew of @entity39 did n't even get the chance to help their passengers or colleagues			1
innocent lives of innocent people wasted in the blink of an eye			0
the moment @entity139 hit home last thursday , when news of the crash broke , i was operating a flight into @entity145 , from where flight @entity39 had left just a few hours earlier			1
there was an odd feel about the place and the usual buzz of an airport was gone			0
as we boarded the flight , one gentleman in particular appeared very upset			2
when i went to see if he was ok he told me that four of his friends had been on the flight			2
then he burst into tears			0
i was speechless , the full impact of this tragedy hit me and all i wanted to do , like so many other flight attendants that day , was to get home and see my family and friends and tell them i loved them			1
much has been made recently of flight attendants being one big family			1
it has been very moving to see , via my blog and social media , the outpouring of love and support to our fallen brothers and sisters at @entity33 , and more recently @entity173 after wednesday 's crash in @entity175			1
and then , almost unbelievably , thursday 's crash of an air algerie flight in @entity178			1
strong bonds in the air it does n't matter what uniform you wear , what aircraft you work on , whether you fly for a low - cost carrier or work in first class , we are united together and become a source of constant support in times of need			2
tight bonds form with your airline colleagues , as you are locked in a metal tube with these people for hours on end ; bonds i have never known outside of the industry			0
i hope to extend the black ribbon idea to one day each year , where flight attendants around the world can remember our fallen colleagues			1
opinion : despite plane crashes , it 's safe to fly			0
