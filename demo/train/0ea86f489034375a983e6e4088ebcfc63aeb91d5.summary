ask a @entity1 what happened on june 10 , 1886 , and they 'll tell you the planet lost its " eighth wonder			2
" the @entity6 and @entity7 of @entity8 were the world 's largest silica towers and the @entity12 's biggest 19th - century attraction until a massive eruption at @entity14 that momentous day blasted these natural wonders into oblivion			1
out of that same eruption , however , a new wonder of the world was born			1
@entity20 roared into existence hurling black mud and sand some 1,500 feet ( 460 meters ) into the sky , making it the most powerful geyser the world has ever seen			1
this new attraction ignited a whirlwind of global interest in @entity31 's volcanic @entity30 until it , too , vanished off the face of the earth in 1904 after a landslide changed the water table			1
the @entity7 and @entity20 may be lost forever , but their impression on tourists of the time is well documented			2
they are but two of many attractions of yesteryear that can now only be appreciated in the pages of a history book			2
here 's a look at 10 others			1
the current @entity48 may be a charmless catacomb of labyrinthine low - ceiling hallways , but @entity51 's first @entity48 was a lavish masterpiece of the @entity54 style			1
the original facility 's domed ceilings , soaring archways and handsome columns welcomed more than 100 million passengers each year during the station 's golden era in the mid- 1940s			1
but by the end of the 1950s , the dawn of the @entity63 and the birth of the @entity65 took a heavy toll on visitor numbers			2
plans for the new @entity70 and @entity71 were announced in 1962 , and a year later , the original @entity48 was knocked to the ground to make room for a smaller facility underground			1
the demolition of @entity48 in 1963 was not without controversy			1
the @entity77 questioned at the time how the city would " permit this monumental act of vandalism against one of the largest and finest landmarks of its age of @entity86 elegance			2
" the whole affair is regularly cited as the catalyst for the modern historical preservation movement in the @entity91			2
within a decade of @entity48 's demolition , @entity92 was protected under @entity51 's new @entity94			1
@entity95 was easily the most powerful cataract in the world in terms of total volume with 1,750,000 cubic feet of water passing through each second			1
that 's more than double the flow of @entity104 and more than 12 times that of @entity105			1
but good luck finding any trace of @entity95 underneath the @entity108			1
more than three decades have now passed since one of the world 's greatest waterfalls was drowned to pave the way for a massive hydroelectric project			1
this natural wonder , lost to the world in 1982 , once lured hordes of local and international tourists to the @entity119 at the @entity122 - @entity121 border			1
it contained 18 falls in total with a drop of about 375 feet , and its deafening roar could be heard from up to 20 miles away			2
at least three @entity129 theaters have graced the shores of the @entity131 over the past five centuries			2
first there was the original @entity129 , built in 1599 by @entity135 's playing company , the @entity136			1
a fire destroyed it during a performance of @entity140 on june 29 , 1613 , but a second @entity141 opened on the same site exactly one year later			0
it , too , closed in 1642 amid an outcry by @entity145 who were opposed to theatrical performances			0
the legacy of the first @entity141 and the iconic plays it debuted to the world lives on at the modern reconstruction , known as @entity152 , which opened its doors in 1997 approximately 750 feet from the original theater			1
when @entity156 first opened to the public in 1894 , the three - acre complex housed a staggering seven pools ( at varying temperatures ) under a massive glass enclosure with springboards , high dives , slides and trapezes			0
the facility could hold as many as 10,000 people at one time and also had several non-aquatic attractions such as a natural history museum with @entity171 mummies and a sculpture gallery with artifacts from @entity174 and @entity175			0
the oceanfront property ensconced in the rocky @entity178 coast was considered a playground unlike any other the world had ever seen			1
its achilles ' heel , however , was an outsized price tag to match its ostentatious offerings			0
with exceedingly high operational costs , the @entity185 were never a commercially successful business -- even after owners turned the pools into ice skating rinks during the @entity191			0
the facility shut down for good in 1964 and was destroyed in a fire two years later			0
its remains are now protected as part of the @entity197			0
in an 1839 fairy tale called " @entity200 , " @entity198 describes a teenager named @entity202 who flies home from the @entity204 and tells his mother , " i came back from @entity175 , where i danced for a while around a tower of porcelain and rang all the bells			0
" the @entity212 author 's fable may be a fantasy , but the tower of porcelain bricks was no figment of his vivid imagination			1
considered one of the @entity221 of the @entity222 , the @entity218 of @entity219 was built by the third emperor of the @entity224 in the early 15th century and rose from a 97 - foot octagonal base to a height of 260 feet			1
this glossy nine - story pagoda soared above the south bank of the @entity229 in @entity219 for more than four centuries before it was destroyed under the @entity231 of the 1850s			1
its rubble remained relatively untouched until 2010 when a businessman donated $ 156 million ( the largest single donation in @entity175 history ) to rebuild the medieval icon			0
the @entity239 was billed as the largest theater in the world when it opened to the public in @entity243 in 1905 , featuring a 100 - foot - by - 200 - foot stage and the capacity to seat up to 5,300 spectators			1
this mammoth attraction lured the biggest acts of the day such as @entity249 and the " @entity251 " musical , but , like @entity178 's @entity156 , it racked up a hefty upkeep bill			1
just 17 years after the @entity239 opened , its owners refashioned the @entity256 - style building into a vaudeville theater			0
five years later it became a movie theater , then an opera house and finally a sports arena			0
the doldrums of the @entity191 dealt one final blow to the facility and it was torn down in 1939 to make way for an office building and parking garage			0
the @entity268 lies 17,400 feet up in the @entity269 and was once one of @entity272 's top tourist attractions , luring skiers the world over with the promise of tackling earth 's highest ski run			1
thanks to global warming , however , the 18,000 - year - old wonder has been reduced to a few lumps of unskiable ice that no visitor would go out of their way to see			0
in its prime it had the first rope tow in @entity289 ( built in 1939 ) and the highest ski lodge in the world , at an elevation greater than @entity293			1
@entity294 was the closest ski area to the equator before it indefinitely closed in 2012			0
known as the " bridge of ice " in the local @entity301 language , @entity294 is but one of many glaciers currently retreating toward almost certain oblivion			0
@entity305 's very first water park , @entity306 , is looking anything but jolly these days after lying abandoned on the shores of @entity309 , @entity310 , for more than a decade			1
the " old - fashioned swimming hole , " replete with swings , slides and whitewater rafting , closed for annual maintenance in 2001 never to open again			0
park officials cited declining business after 9/11 and the success of @entity305 's two newer water parks , @entity320 and @entity321 , as reasons for their decision			2
@entity309 is also home to the only other @entity325 park to close permanently : @entity326			0
this abandoned ( but not demolished ) zoological park was yet another 1970s - era attraction that lost favor with visitors and eventually closed to the public in 1999			0
all animals were relocated to new homes at @entity325 's @entity334 , a much larger zoo that opened in 1998			2
a warning to any urban explorers out there : @entity325 employees still monitor both @entity306 and @entity326 for trespassers			0
like the operas that brought its audiences to tears , the story of the @entity342 of @entity343 is fittingly tragic			0
designed by @entity351 in the 1860s , architect of the @entity342 in @entity350 's @entity349 , it was the crowning jewel of @entity355 's capital city for just six years before a fire gutted the interior			2
it was resurrected from the flames four years later , but tragedy struck again during @entity361 when the @entity342 received a direct hit from an aerial bomb			0
a few columns remain in place on the corner of @entity367 , forming a backdrop for the open - air royal @entity369 , launched within the ruins of the @entity342 in 2013			0
@entity373 's tomb in @entity374 , @entity375 , is the newest addition to this list and one of a series of attractions lost to war			2
militants with the @entity383 , or @entity384 , planted explosives in july 2014 around @entity374 's oldest mosque , which is traditionally held to be the burial place of @entity373			2
@entity373 is a key figure in both @entity389 and @entity390 who , according to @entity383 and judeo - christian traditions , was swallowed by a whale			0
his tomb was a popular place of pilgrimage and joins a growing list of holy sites deemed idolatrous under the puritanical strain of @entity390 practiced by @entity384			0
@entity400 is an @entity91 travel and culture writer based in @entity403 , @entity404 .			0

unlike the current *commuter* *hub* , @entity51 's original @entity48 was a lavish @entity54 masterpiece
@entity95 was once the most powerful cataract in the world
the @entity218 of @entity219 was considered one of the @entity221 of the @entity222
