the disastrous roll out of the @entity1 raises a litany of questions about president @entity5 's leadership and management ability			1
but it also begs for an answer to who would take the fall			2
as problems mount , rep. @entity11 , @entity12 , said thursday that " heads should have rolled " at the @entity15			1
@entity17 secretary @entity16 , the woman in charge of implementing @entity1 , took the blame for a flawed @entity21 website , even as calls mounted -- inside and outside of @entity23 - for her to be fired			1
testifying before a hostile congressional committee , @entity16 said she should be held accountable for the online site that stumbled out of the starting gate on october 1 and wo n't be functioning smoothly for most people -- according to @entity5 , himself -- until the end of the month			1
" i 'm responsible , " she told lawmakers			2
but @entity5 had her back			0
@entity15 spokesman @entity31 said the president has " full confidence " in @entity16			1
@entity34 , crisis management expert and ceo of @entity34 , said that an age - old @entity15 policy is that federal agencies take the blame and the @entity15 collects the props			1
but as letters started landing in people 's mailboxes , notifying them that their health insurance plans were being canceled , @entity16 might have been in deeper hot water , except that @entity5 promised when selling @entity1 that people could keep their plans if they like them			1
that was not true in the end			0
@entity5 takes brunt of new storm people were given false assurance			0
@entity16 shrunk out of the spotlight as @entity5 's unkept promise took the brunt of a new storm			1
it culminated in a public apology on thursday when @entity5 -- also talking about the website -- acknowledged that he " fumbled " the launch of his signature domestic policy achievement			0
while @entity5 is taking responsibility publicly , internally he is faced with many questions , including why his staff let him make such a claim if it was n't true			0
should @entity16 have known ? she was responsible for overseeing the implementation and creation of the specifics of @entity1			1
additionally , as a former insurance commissioner responsible for approving or rejecting coverage plans for @entity73 consumers , it seemed like she would have had an understanding of the impact as federal coverage standards changed to become more robust			2
and some insurance commissioners are troubled by the president 's proposal to allow a one year extension of individual health plans -- those most likely to be canceled			2
@entity16 ' successor , @entity82 , said she and her fellow insurance commissioners around the country warned the administration early on			1
" we said from the get - go that if you start taking pieces out of this , it will collapse , " @entity82 told the @entity86			0
should someone be fired ? " i think there is limited utility in just firing people , but if you need to do it for political reasons , it 's always an option , " @entity34 said			0
@entity34 cautioned , however , that this is not an acute problem but a chronic one , and firing @entity16 wo n't make everything magically better			1
even if @entity5 chose to fire @entity16 , he would need to replace her , and that may be the ultimate reason why she may stay on for now			1
not only would it take time for a new health secretary to get up to speed , a permanent replacement requires @entity110 confirmation -- lately an unappealing prospect for @entity5			1
finding someone else would likely subject @entity5 to a damaging political fight with @entity114 determined to draw as much attention to the problematic components of @entity1			2
@entity118 senior political analyst @entity117 said that a new health nominee would ensure " virtual certainty " for @entity114 to " use this as kind of a way to leverage more concessions from the administration			2
" @entity118 's chief political analyst , @entity126 , said @entity16 ' head would roll at some point			1
" he 's very deliberate			0
in the end , will she go ? eventually			0
but there are lots of other issues she 's got to deal with first , " @entity126 said			0
but for now , this is @entity5 's problem			0
it is called @entity1 , not @entity136			2
" @entity137 ceases to be an option , " @entity34 said			0
" @entity137 is an option when you have a place to hide and when no one is looking			0
it 's not an option when there 's no place to hide and everyone 's looking			0

more trouble for @entity1 puts more *pressure* on health secretary @entity16
