as televised theater , it was hard to beat			0
as political prognostication , it was a head - scratching moment			0
as partisan warfare , it was nothing short of audacious			0
but @entity8 's insistence that @entity9 had not carried @entity10 -- despite the call by his own network , @entity13 , that the president had done just that -- represented something larger			1
it captured , for some long and awkward moments , the refusal of some in the media - and - politics game to accept reality			2
and that has been a recurring pattern this year			0
we 're not talking here about a bad judgment call by a pundit			0
everyone in the commentary business , including yours truly , has made those			0
if failed predictions were a felony , the jails would be filled with media folks			0
watch : @entity8 rejects reality on @entity13 @entity8 , to be sure , is a smart guy			1
he was n't called @entity38 's architect for nothing			2
he helped his guy win two presidential elections			0
he knows polls inside out			2
but @entity8 occupies a rather unique perch at @entity13 , and not just because he jumped from the @entity44 to the role of conservative cable commentator			1
@entity8 , who also has a @entity48 column , helped create two political action committees , @entity50 and @entity51 , that raised and spent about $ 175 million in this campaign , most of it on television ads promoting @entity56 or attacking @entity9			1
he was , in every sense of the word , a full - fledged political player			0
but he was also @entity13 's most visible contributor , appearing far more often than @entity61 , delivering his political insights on shows from morning to night			1
watch : media still go wild for @entity65 , who drove @entity56 nuts @entity13 is n't the only news channel to employ active partisans -- @entity69 has a few , too -- and media organizations long ago decided to blur the line between journalism and politics			1
i know the ties are generally disclosed , but personally , i would n't allow anyone who raises money or holds a party position to be on a news organization 's payroll			0
why should viewers think they 're getting anything but one - sided spin ? still , @entity8 undoubtedly wants to preserve his reputation as a political seer , which is why it was so stunning when he went rogue on tuesday night			2
it was a moment of high drama			0
@entity13 , @entity69 and @entity89 were each in the process of calling @entity10 -- and thus the presidential race -- for @entity9			1
but @entity8 began arguing with his @entity13 colleagues			1
" i do n't know what the outcome is gon na be , but you should n't , you got ta be careful about calling things when you 've got something like 991 votes separating the two candidates and a quarter of the vote left to count , " he said			0
" even if they had made it on the basis of select precincts , i 'd be very cautious about intruding in this process			0
" @entity8 was , of course , wrong ; @entity9 won @entity10 , and a second term			1
but what is striking is that he was challenging the decision - desk professionals at his network in a way that looked like he refused to accept the country 's judgment			1
watch : blame game -- the knives are out for @entity56 world this , unfortunately , has been a recurring theme all year			0
when @entity56 was down in the polls , some conservatives complained that media organizations were putting out biased surveys ( which led to such sites as @entity125 )			2
when unemployment dropped in september , even critics as prominent as @entity127 accused the @entity9 administration of cooking the books without a scintilla of evidence			1
and when @entity134 , the @entity135 ' number - crunching blogger , predicted @entity9 had a 90 % chance of winning , conservatives accused him of bias			2
turns out he called the outcome correctly in every state			0
watch : turns out ' liberal ' media were right about @entity9 @entity65 , who hardly distinguished himself in this campaign by pushing the birther nonsense , ranted on @entity143 on @entity144 that @entity9 's victory was a " disgusting injustice			1
" so he not only does n't accept that the president was born in @entity148 , he does n't accept that @entity9 won the election fair and square			2
i would n't suggest that @entity8 believes in any of this conspiracy stuff , though he doubled down on thursday by saying the president won by having " suppressed the vote , " which flies in the face of @entity9 's efforts to boost turnout			1
but for a brief moment on @entity144 , we got a glimpse of pure partisanship in the guise of journalism .			1

@entity164 : @entity8 challenged his own network 's pros on @entity144
the @entity13 decision team called @entity10 for @entity9 , but @entity8 refused to accept it
@entity164 points out conservatives challenged accuracy of polls and of the unemployment stats
he says the @entity8 *incident* was a case of partisanship in the guise of journalism
