one year after the @entity10 bombings and almost three years after his death in a @entity3 drone strike in @entity4 , @entity5 , the @entity7 - born @entity6 cleric who was an operational leader of @entity8 , continues to be a major influence on violent jihadist extremists in the @entity6			1
even in death , @entity5 is the key cleric in the @entity16 - speaking world of radical @entity17 that militants are turning to for inspiration			1
his many lectures and interviews are still widely available on the @entity22 , and they are in colloquial @entity16 to boot			0
@entity25 , for instance , influenced the suspects in the @entity10 bombings			0
@entity25 was born in 1971 in @entity28 , @entity7 , where his father was studying agricultural economics at @entity31 as a @entity33 scholar			0
as an undergrad , @entity5 attended @entity35 , studying engineering			2
in 1994 while living in @entity37 , @entity5 married his first wife , a cousin from @entity4			2
a year later , @entity5 moved to @entity39 , where he took up a job as a cleric at a local mosque			2
by his own account , it was during this period that @entity5 began to develop a hatred for the @entity6 , feelings he was quite adept at keeping to himself			1
this hatred was sparked by the first @entity48 , which followed @entity50 's invasion of @entity51 in august 1990			0
six months later a massive @entity6 army based in @entity53 expelled @entity50 's troops from @entity51			1
after @entity50 's armies were ignominiously pushed out of @entity51 , a large - scale @entity6 military presence in @entity53 continued for many years			1
for politicized , fundamentalist muslims such as @entity5 , the presence of thousands of " infidel " @entity6 troops on the holy land of @entity53 was a deep irritant			1
during his years living in @entity39 and later in @entity62 , @entity5 met with three of the 9/11 hijackers in the months before the attacks			2
almost a decade later he also gave the order to @entity66 , the " underwear bomber " to take down an @entity6 plane with a bomb			2
@entity66 ignited his bomb on @entity70 on christmas day 2009 as it flew over the suburbs of @entity72 , but luckily the device failed to detonate properly			0
as a result of the operational role @entity5 was playing in @entity8 , president @entity74 gave the authorization for his death , and on the morning of september 30 , 2011 , @entity3 drones locked on to the vehicle he was traveling in @entity4 and fired missiles that killed the cleric			1
@entity74 called the death of @entity5 a " major blow " to @entity85 in @entity4 , which had now lost its " leader of external operations			2
" but it turns out that killing the militant cleric was easier than killing his ideas that linger on in the virtual world			2
@entity92 , the younger brother who survived a shootout with police shortly after the @entity10 bombings , had downloaded articles written by @entity5 , according to the indictment against him			1
@entity92 also downloaded the first issue of @entity100 magazine , @entity8 's @entity16 - language webzine , which @entity5 helped to produce			1
law enforcement officials linked the pipe bombs allegedly used by the @entity92 brothers in the @entity10 bombings to step - by - step instructions for how to build similar pipe bombs that were printed in that first issue of @entity100			0
the @entity92 brothers may not be the only individuals in the @entity6 to have been influenced by @entity5			1
according to a count by the @entity113 , since 9/11 , 52 @entity6 citizens or @entity6 residents indicted in a jihadist terrorist - related crime or that have been killed have cited @entity5 as an influence , possessed his propaganda or were in communication or met with him			1
@entity25 was in e-mail communication , for instance , with maj. @entity119 , who killed 13 people in a shooting at @entity122 , @entity123 , in 2009			0
nor are the @entity124 the only @entity6 likely to be influenced by @entity100			2
according to a count by the @entity113 , at least 16 individuals indicted since the magazine 's first issue in 2010 have possessed or cited @entity100 as an influence			1
even today , court documents continue to cite @entity5 and @entity100 as influencing factors in terrorism cases			2
eighteen individuals indicted in the @entity6 since @entity5 's death in 2011 have cited his influence or possessed his propaganda			1
in june , for instance , @entity136 , an 18 - year - old @entity137 , pleaded guilty to attempting to travel to @entity4 to join @entity8			0
according to his plea agreement , @entity136 told an undercover officer , " my standard is sheik @entity5 and @entity142 ( @entity143 ) , both who bore witness to the truth			0
" in november , the government indicted @entity148 , a 29 - year - old living in @entity150 , and charged him with attempting to provide material support to @entity152 , a @entity153 @entity8 affiliate			0
the criminal complaint alleges that @entity148 posted a link on @entity156 to a propaganda video narrated by @entity5			0
in december , the government filed an indictment against @entity159 , a 58 - year - old man from @entity160 , @entity161 , alleging he attempted to explode a car bomb at the @entity163			0
the criminal complaint alleges that @entity159 told an undercover @entity166 informant , " @entity167 and @entity5 are a great inspiration to me , " and , " i have read @entity5 's 44 ways of @entity170 , and like everything l 've ever read of his , it 's very informative			1
" in march , @entity174 , a 20 - year - old from @entity176 , @entity177 , was arrested and charged with attempting to travel to fight in @entity153			0
the criminal complaint alleges that @entity174 's computer contained copies and excerpts of @entity100			0
it is not just the @entity6 government that continues to view @entity5 as maintaining , even in death , his power to influence			1
@entity8 continues to publish @entity100			0
the latest issue appeared in march featuring a purported interview with @entity5 made before his death in which he urged attacks on @entity191 civilians			0
@entity8 and individuals motivated by the group 's ideology continue to view @entity5 as an important voice so his writings , available on the @entity22 , will likely continue to crop up in terrorism cases for the foreseeable future			1
what can be done to counter this ? an implausible approach is a " takedown " effort			0
trying to eliminate @entity5 's writings on " holy war " on the internet just wo n't work			1
eliminate them on some sites , and they will simply pop up on others			0
another more plausible approach would be for @entity16 - speaking @entity17 clerics to contest publicly and widely @entity5 's arguments for justified holy wars against @entity215			1
so far such efforts remain limited both in number and reach .			0

@entity219 says a terrorist killed in a @entity6 drone strike continues to influence jihadists
he says it was easier for @entity6 to kill @entity5 than to eliminate support for his ideas
suspect in @entity230 bombings downloaded @entity5 's articles and his magazine , @entity219 says
@entity234 : many other charges have been brought against followers of @entity5
