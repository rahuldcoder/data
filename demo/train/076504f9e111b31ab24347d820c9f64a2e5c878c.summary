-- thanks to @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , and the surprising success of @entity7 , the box office climbed to record levels in june , earning $ 1.25 billion — a 19 percent increase over june 2012			0
this week , @entity10 and @entity11 , which both begin showing tonight to take advantage of the july 4th holiday weekend , will try to keep the box office firing on all cylinders			1
the former is poised to dominate the field , but the latter seems unlikely to lasso a big enough audience to justify its gargantuan budget			0
here 's how i think the box office might shake out over the wednesday - to - sunday period : 1			0
@entity10 -- $ 125 million the original @entity10 was a surprise success in 2010 , opening with $ 56 million en route to a $ 251 million finish			1
adults enjoyed the sly edge of the animated feature , and their kids fell in love with the yellow " minions , " which became breakout characters in the same vein as @entity35 's penguins or @entity37 's acorn - chasing squirrel , @entity38			0
for @entity10 , @entity39 is plastering the minions on any free ad space they can			1
the studio has inked licensing deals with @entity49 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , and other national brands			0
plus , they 've got a " @entity51 " flying around the country			0
but those promotional efforts would n't matter all that much if audiences did n't genuinely love the original — and boy did they			0
in fact , @entity39 could have a shrek 2 situation on their hands here — while the original movie became a word - of - mouth smash ( @entity63 earned $ 267 million ) , the sequel could be a slam dunk right out of the gate ( shrek 2 wound up earning $ 441.3 million			1
@entity10 does face animated competition from @entity5 , which has topped the chart for two weekends , but @entity10 is fresher in kids ' minds , since its predecessor came out just three ( not 12 ) years ago , and it 's safe to say there 's more built - in excitement for the young franchise			1
opening in over 3,900 theaters , @entity10 , which cost @entity39 and @entity79 only $ 76 million to produce , may earn about $ 130 million over the five - day period			1
@entity11 -- $ 58 million @entity80 spent at least $ 225 million on this @entity82 - directed western , which stars @entity83 and @entity84 ( though many commercials seem to ignore @entity84 's presence altogether ) , but with terrible reviews and a major lack of social media activity , @entity11 looks likely to become an expensive misfire for the studio			1
just to earn back its budget domestically , @entity11 will have to earn $ 40 million more than the highest - grossing western of all time , @entity95 , which took in $ 184 million in 1990			1
that seems very , very unlikely			0
audiences have just never flocked to desert - set movies the way they have superhero flicks or lush adventures like @entity83 and @entity82 's @entity103 franchise			0
recently , western blockbuster @entity104 underperformed with a $ 36.5 million opening and a $ 100.2 million total against a $ 163 million budget			1
that seems like a fair comparison for @entity11 — though @entity83 's appeal does boost prospects considerably ( especially on the international front , where westerns often toil )			2
tracking suggests that @entity11 could gallop away with about $ 70 million over five days , but in a marketplace stuffed with well - liked releases , that sounds quite high			1
debuting in about 3,700 theaters , @entity11 could wrangle about $ 58 million in its first five days			1
for a standard @entity122 release , that result would be just fine			0
for a $ 225 million tentpole with bad reviews and limited international appeal — that could spell trouble			1
@entity5 -- $ 34 million the film may fall by about 50 percent due to direct competition from @entity10 , but that still puts it on track for a $ 23 million three - day weekend — and about $ 34 million adding in wednesday and thursday grosses as well			1
all told , @entity5 should have nearly $ 220 million domestically by the time sunday night rolls around			2
the @entity133 -- $ 32 million without any new comedies arriving on the scene , the heat should continue to play well with adult women in its sophomore frame			2
the r - rated laugher scored $ 39.1 million in its debut frame , and it could take in another $ 32 million over the wednesday - to - sunday period , which would give the $ 43 million @entity143 film about $ 82 million after two weekends on the chart			2
@entity146 -- $ 24 million @entity148 's zombie thriller has been holding up very well on weekdays , but the simple fact that the box office is about to get even more crowded may keep it from notching an exemplary hold			1
still , it could score another $ 24 million in five days , yielding a $ 156 million gross			2
also keep an eye on @entity156 : let me explain , which is opening in about 800 theaters on wednesday			0
the comedy film , shot during one of @entity156 's stand - up shows at @entity163 , follows in the footsteps of comedy film @entity156 : @entity166 , which broke out with a $ 7.7 million total in 2011			2
since then , @entity156 has hosted the @entity169 , starred in @entity171 's @entity170 , helped lead @entity172 to a $ 90 million finish , and grown his fanbase substantially			2
thus , over the five - day frame , let me explain may take in a very impressive $ 11 million — not bad considering the film cost only $ 2.5 million to produce			0
