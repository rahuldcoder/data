-- @entity1 , under fire for allegedly fabricating details in his best - seller " @entity11 , " agreed in a settlement to give the charity he co-founded more than $ 1 million , nearly a year after @entity8 's attorney general began investigating the organization 's financial affairs			1
the report issued thursday notes the " accusations of inaccuracies and falsehoods in the narratives " of his books " were not the subject " of the investigation			0
but attorney general @entity20 said his office 's investigation did find " serious internal problems in the management " of the @entity26 , @entity8 - based @entity25 that @entity1 helped create			1
under the terms of the deal , @entity1 must repay more than $ 1 million to the charity within three years			2
this comes after state investigators determined @entity1 was " double - dipping " when he did n't reimburse the institute for travel expenses he got from sponsors			1
their report also stated he did not pay the charity promised royalties and charged it " substantial personal expenses " -- like " @entity42 clothing , @entity43 , luggage , luxurious accommodations and even vacations			2
" " when employees challenged him by attempting to get him to provide documentation to substantiate expenditures or otherwise to comply with sound management practices , he resisted and / or ignored them , " the report 's authors wrote			0
" some of them ended up leaving			0
" while he can remain an employee of the @entity25 , @entity1 can " no longer oversee financial aspects of the charity or serve as a voting member of the board of directors , " according to the attorney general 's office			1
the @entity25 's two other board members will step down after a transitional period of 12 months and a new seven - member board will be appointed in its place , according to the settlement			0
its interim director , @entity67 , a " longtime family friend of @entity1 , " will eventually give way to a new chief executive , @entity66 told reporters thursday			0
in addition , the charity faces " more organizational and financial controls " and will be monitored by the attorney general for three years			1
this comes after the attorney general concluded that @entity1 " failed to fulfill some of his responsibilities " as executive director , and gave a similar assessment of the institute 's board			1
@entity1 shot to worldwide fame with " @entity11 : one man 's @entity85 and @entity87 ... one school at a @entity89			1
" the book describes his getting lost in an effort to climb the world 's second - tallest mountain , @entity95 , being rescued by @entity96 in the village of @entity98 and vowing to return there to build a school for local girls			0
about 4 million versions were sold of the paperback version alone , which spent 57 weeks on the @entity106 best - seller list , the attorney general 's report said			1
the riveting story led to the creation of the @entity25 , an organization that endeavors to improve girls ' education in @entity96 and @entity112			0
last spring , however , the charity and @entity1 found themselves on the defensive against accusations of mismanagement and exaggeration , if not outright fabrication , of key sections from the book			0
this followed a critical report on @entity124 " @entity123 " in which @entity125 -- the author of the best - selling " @entity126 , " who said he had donated $ 75,000 to the @entity25 -- said @entity1 's account is " a beautiful story , and it 's a lie			2
" days after that report , @entity8 's attorney general announced he was launching an investigation amid " concerns ... raised about the management and financial affairs of the @entity25			1
" the organization recorded income of $ 14 million in 2009 , the vast majority of which was raised from private individuals , many of whom were no doubt inspired by @entity1 's books			2
however , in 2009 , less than half that money actually went to building schools in @entity112 and @entity96 , and $ 1.7 million went to promote @entity1 's books , according to the institute 's board of directors			2
@entity1 resigned as his charity 's executive director last november			2
his successor in that post , @entity67 , acknowledged in a statement on the @entity25 's website that " this past year brought unprecedented challenges for all of us			0
" she said that the charity is " pleased " that an agreement has been signed " resolving " the attorney general 's investigation			1
" while we respectfully disagree with some of the analysis and conclusions in the ( attorney general 's ) report , we look forward to moving ahead as an even stronger organization , " @entity67 wrote			1
she spoke highly of the work the charity has continued to do , as well as the role that @entity1 has had -- and may continue to have on its operations going forward			0
" @entity1 and our overseas managers have dedicated their lives to helping fulfill countless dreams and aspirations , and we are honored to continue our life - changing work together , " said @entity67			0
@entity8 's attorney general stressed thursday that he believes the charity has and can continue to do " good things , " adding he hoped the settlement agreement will help restore " donor confidence			1
" " i think it 's a fair settlement that it 's in the best interests not only of the charity , but of the children of @entity112 and others that the @entity25 serves , " said @entity66 .			0
