-- " @entity2 's " season 6 premiere ratings were n't revelatory , but the episode sure was			1
sunday brought the return of @entity6 ' @entity5 in an episode called " @entity8 , " which saw an arresting unexpected twist			1
after the loss of @entity13 last season , it would 've been reasonable for " @entity2 " to come back mild ; give its viewers ' heart rates a little rest			1
viewers were instead treated to the arrest of @entity22 's @entity21 for allegedly assisting @entity24 drug dealer @entity23 in transporting narcotics			2
those watching at home were stunned , and , according to @entity22 , the arrest came as a surprise to him , too			2
" it was certainly an unexpected storyline , " the actor told @entity32			2
" when i went into wardrobe and saw it was a prison uniform that i needed to try on , i told my costume designers , ' that 's not a suit ... ' " we hope @entity22 's prison uniform is comfortable , because the actor added this plot wo n't neatly tie up anytime soon			2
" it 's not a storyline that 's going to go away			0
we 're going to see how it affects @entity21 personally and professionally and how it affects everyone at the firm and on the show , " the actor said to @entity32			0
" what the state 's attorney 's office is doing in terms of the case is going to be a huge part of season 6			0
whether that means @entity21 is going to be in jail or out of jail i ca n't say , but i can say that that particular storyline is going to continue			0
you will learn more about @entity21 and @entity23 's relationship			0
we will touch on a lot of different issues that come from that storyline			0
it is less about @entity21 being in jail and more about him having been arrested			0
" unfortunately , the ratings did n't quite repay " @entity2 " for its storytelling chutzpah , as the season 6 opener was slightly down with a 1.3 rating in the advertiser - valued 18 - 49 adult demographic ; last year 's premiere received a 1.5 rating			1
in total viewers , the episode drew nearly 10 million			1
by comparison , @entity80 ' new series , the @entity82 - starring " madam secretary , " had a 2.0 in the adult demo , with 14.7 million tuning in			1
that 's a promising start for the freshman program , which has earned some mixed reviews from critics			0
leoni stars as @entity91 , a professor and former @entity93 agent who 's abruptly appointed to the position of secretary of state after the current one dies			1
@entity91 's also married and a mom , so part of the background for " madam secretary 's " stories are the reality of balancing work and home life			1
so far , not so bad : the @entity105 thought the pilot was " taut and well - structured , " aided by a " calm , cool and wry performance " from @entity82			0
the @entity108 called the series a " front - runner " this fall tv season , thanks to its sharp writing " and formidable cast			0
" the @entity115 too saw potential , acknowledging that " madam secretary is not perfect , but it could be			1
" but others have taken a less optimistic view			0
for @entity121 , the problem with " madam secretary " is that it 's " just really , really dull , as if someone tried to make a counterweight to ' scandal ' with only the boring parts			1
" @entity126 , which calls " madam secretary " a " slightly more simple - minded return to ' @entity128 , ' " is curious to see how the series will use its stronger selling points			1
the show , the trade paper says , " has enough interesting pieces ... to have significant potential			0
" it 's just that sunday 's premiere " does n't bode particularly well for being able to maximize those assets ... as they say in diplomatic circles , the devil is in the details			2

" @entity2 " and " madam secretary " premiered sunday on @entity80
" @entity2 " was slightly down in ratings , but had a strong episode
" madam secretary " had better ratings , but more *flaws*
