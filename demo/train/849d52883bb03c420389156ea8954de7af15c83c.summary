" three years ago , i could only stand 20 minutes at a time , " said @entity1 , 34 , who injured his spine 10 years ago			1
" now it 's an hour and a half every day			2
" in 2002 , @entity1 was 24 and had landed a dream job at a major magazine when he took a trip to a summer house just outside @entity11			1
it was a perfect summer evening , and the pool was dimly lit. @entity1 recalls the moment : it was as if the pool was begging him to dive in			1
without hesitation , he listened			2
his chin hit the floor of the pool			2

" " the first thing i thought was , ' you 're an idiot ! ' " approximately 1.3 million people in the @entity27 are living with a spinal cord injury ( @entity29 ) , according to the @entity30 and @entity31			2
most of these injuries affect people between the ages of 15 and 35 , the majority of them men			2
@entity1 describes spending three years after his injury wallowing in guilt and self - pity			1
his desire to become who he used to be , he says , helped him find the will to not only move again -- but to move on			1
@entity1 's recovery is documented in his book " walking papers			1
" in the intensive care unit , his prognosis was hopeless			1
doctors told his parents that their son would live the rest of his life on a ventilator and never speak			2
there was no chance of him ever moving anything below his neck			2
" the man next door to me was screaming for morphine because he was in the final stages of cancer , " says @entity1			1
" the thing that really scared me was that when i got in my room , he had a higher chance of living			2
it really made me fight			2
" he attributes this perseverance to his family and their unconditional support			1
brain - controlled devices may help paralyzed people @entity1 's sister , @entity75 , had just graduated from college when he was paralyzed			1
she and the rest of his family have helped @entity1 battle his injury from the start			1
" we 've come to appreciate early on the small improvements that he makes because they become actually quite big , " said @entity81			0
" he 'll be walking , i know he will be			0
when it 's time , i know his body is going to be ready			0
" in the months after the accident , @entity1 pushed his health insurance provider to double his physical therapy sessions and cover more of his therapy equipment			1
when doctors urged him to just accept that he would never move again , @entity1 defied the prognosis			1
less than a year after his injury , he could feel his shoulders			0
" i never wanted to believe that there would never be a cure for @entity29 i was showing people how i already defied what my diagnosis meant			0
so why could n't i push for more ? " @entity1 completes five hours of physical therapy a week			1
while standing , he does cardio for an hour and a half			0
he lifts weights in his garage			0
he practices kicking his legs while playing a dance game with his niece			0
he undergoes electrical stimulation on his hands , legs and abs. on the weekends , he practices lifting his body off his bed			0
he describes his therapy like training for the @entity116			0
he was tenacious , pursuing conventional therapies alongside less - proven ones			1
from stem cell surgery in @entity120 to different clinical trials , @entity1 was fiercely determined to move again			1
dr. @entity122 , a research fellow involved with one of these clinical trials , refers to @entity1 as his " star pupil			1
" " if there 's a door shut for him , he 'll check elsewhere , " said @entity122			0
" he 's constantly looking for other things			0
he wants to make more of a difference than anyone i know			0
" a tiny step forward for spinal cord injuries @entity1 attributes his progress to intense physical therapy and clinical studies , as well as to the stem cell therapy			1
he describes his motor movement as more fluid and refined ; he can now move his toes , stretch his calves and feel hot and cold on his legs			1
@entity1 also lost the ability to sweat , which led to flaky skin and chronic acne			1
so he started experimenting with botanical extracts in his kitchen and developed the @entity1 's botanicals skin - care line			1
" the power of something as seemingly innocuous as beauty -- the power it has to make you feel strong and empowered -- there 's something to be said about that , " explains @entity1			1
he recalls being afraid of asking what he could do to walk , worrying that people would laugh at him			0
" now i 'm not afraid of that , and it 's evolving , because i 'm feeling more and doing more , " he says			0
" the people who i thought would laugh at me now look at me and say , ' oh , my gosh , this recovery is incredible			0
' " @entity1 hopes to empower other patients to take control of their recovery			1
" your injury does n't define you			0
you will get better , " he says when asked what he would say to those newly diagnosed with paralysis			0
" ... you should want more and you should ask the questions that you really want to ask and then find the answers , and do n't take anybody 's word as truth			0
use your curiosity and imagination to benefit your recovery			0
" @entity1 is seeking more cutting - edge @entity29 studies and continues to spread the word as a national ambassador for the @entity30 and @entity31			1
he believes he is " definitely going to be walking " in the next five years and hopes to finally take a vacation			0
most recently , he says , his feet began sweating , another sign of success			0
but after his near - death experience , his priority is to just be happy			1
hearing that something is impossible " does n't make sense to me anymore , " he says			0
" i was three breaths away from dying ... it 's about prioritizing what 's important to you			0
my priority is being happy and feeling fulfilled			0
it 's more about giving back to a bigger community with the experience that i have			0
