@entity0 -- a 21 - month investigation into allegations that the @entity4 has a hostile work environment -- rife with discrimination and retaliation -- has concluded that no " widespread " problem exists , according to an internal government e-mail obtained by @entity1			1
but , investigators also concluded , a large number of air marshals think those problems exist			1
the e-mail is the first glimpse into the long - awaited investigative report , which is scheduled to be released to the public on february 9			0
whistle - blowers in the air marshal 's @entity20 , @entity22 , field office triggered the investigation in early 2010 when they alleged that supervisors used a " jeopardy ! " - style whiteboard to demean and ridicule rank - and - file officers			1
the board contained derogatory terms to allude to gays , lesbians and african - americans , they said			0
but the investigation grew to include other field offices and other accusations , and the @entity40 's internal e-mail tuesday said @entity42 investigators have interviewed more than 300 @entity40 employees			2
while investigators have remained silent about their work , air marshals contacted by @entity1 say they provided evidence of a wide range of misconduct , including a supervisor who ran a private security business while at work , supervisors who perjured themselves in sworn testimony against subordinates , and instances of favoritism , racism , sexism and discrimination			1
a @entity4 spokeswoman declined to comment on the pending report and government e-mail tuesday			2
but several air marshals said they are eager to read the report , and say they will dispute any conclusion that discrimination and retaliation are not widespread			1
" we 're going to tear the report apart , " one air marshal , who asked not to be identified , said tuesday			1
" we 're going to take and review the report and we 're going to look at our conclusions , because we know what we gave them			0
" the internal @entity40 e-mail summarizes the report 's findings			1
" the ( @entity42 ) concluded that there was no widespread discrimination or retaliation within ( the @entity4 ) , " it says			2
" however , the report does suggest that a large segment of our workforce feels that retaliation and discrimination exists			0
" supervisors have a responsibility to " dispel " the perception that the service is rife with discrimination and retaliation , it continues			0
in addition to the normal investigative techniques , the @entity42 took the unusual step of surveying the air marshal workforce			2
the survey asked air marshals if favoritism ever played a role in promotions , job evaluations and mission assignments ; whether air marshals have ever been discriminated against or harassed on the job ; and whether they feel they can report misconduct without fear of retaliation			1
in august 2011 , the @entity40 declined a @entity1 @entity108 request for the survey results , saying that the documents involved an ongoing investigation			0
it also said the results could reveal the total number of air marshals , which is classified			0
a @entity117 committee has scheduled a hearing on the air marshals on feb. 16 .			0

@entity1 obtained an internal @entity40 e-mail about a probe of the @entity4
e-mail : @entity125 found discrimination is *n't* " widespread , " but many air marshals think it is
air marshals tell @entity1 they provided evidence of perjury , discrimination , other misconduct
" we 're going to tear the report apart , " says air marshal who asked not to be identified
