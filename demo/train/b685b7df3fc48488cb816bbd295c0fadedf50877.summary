an eerie silence fell across town as emergency rescue officials said they do n't think anyone was still alive under the rubble			0
about half of @entity88 's population was unaccounted for			2
so far , about 15,000 people have been rescued , the @entity23 reported monday , citing @entity101 @entity1 troops went door - to - door in the city of @entity105 , hoping to find survivors -- but found mostly the bodies of elderly residents			1
