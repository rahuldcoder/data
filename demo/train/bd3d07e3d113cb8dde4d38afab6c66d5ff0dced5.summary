-- do n't simply saunter up to the boarding gate at a @entity3 flight and think you can carry on your luggage for free			1
that 'll cost you $ 100 starting tuesday			1
while discount carrier @entity3 makes customers pay for most carry - on and checked luggage , its customers could pay up to $ 100 to bring their bags if they forget to pay in advance the airline has raised other fees as well			1
carry - on baggage is now $ 35 if purchased during online booking ( $ 25 for members of the airline 's fare club ) and $ 50 if purchased at the airport kiosk			2
your first checked bag now costs $ 30 if paid during online booking ( $ 20 for fare club member ) , increases to $ 45 if purchased at the airport kiosk and increases to $ 100 if you check it at the gate			1
you can still carry a purse , briefcase or other small personal item for free			0
" our goal is for no customer ever to pay the $ 100 fee , " said spirit chief operating officer @entity30 in a statement			1
" by planning ahead and paying for bags before getting to the boarding gate , our customers are saving time at the airport and speeding up the boarding process			2
when our customers choose these time - saving , self - service options , our costs go down , and we can pass those savings along to our customers			0
" airlines making billions from fees @entity3 's fees may seem extreme to some passengers , but most airlines seem to be making money from charging for services beyond the basic ride they provide			1
additional revenue is generated by " a la carte " services such as snacks , preferred seating , luggage fees , commissions for hotel bookings and frequent flier mile sales to partners			2
airline ancillary revenue is projected to reach $ 36.1 billion worldwide this year , according to the @entity63 of @entity64 , an increase of 11.3 % over last year			1
that $ 36.1 billion is 5.4 % of global airline revenues of $ 667 billion			2
" as far as fees are concerned , airlines ' attitude is , ' the more , the merrier , ' " said @entity67 , @entity68 's senior director of research			0
" travelers who do n't have enough mileage status to enjoy any exemptions should plan for some extra spending when planning their travel , especially if they are traveling during peak times around @entity81 and @entity82 , when overhead bin space will be hard to come by			0
" websites such as @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 have convenient tables so travelers can plan in advance to some extent , @entity67 added			0
fees for ' extras ' likely to continue will passengers see more fees in 2013 ? there 's no end to the creativity of airlines to charge separate fees for things that used to be included in the price of a ticket , according to @entity104 , founder of @entity105			2
@entity106 now gives a discount for paying with a debit card versus a credit card , and @entity110 has charged an extra $ 20 on some flights for seats closer to the front of the plane with early boarding , wrote @entity104 in an e-mail			1
" we might even see fees scaled by distance flown			0
if these fees are really about fuel consumption , why should a checked bag flown 300 miles cost the same as one flown 2,500 miles ? " we may also see penalties -- er , fees -- for passengers who do n't print their boarding passes , pay baggage fees and check in online before arriving at the airport , " @entity104 wrote			0
" want to deal with a human at the airport ? you 'll pay for that			0
there 's no end to the imagination when it comes to new and ' improved ' fee structures			0

travelers can avoid @entity3 $ 100 fee by paying for bags when booking flight online
airlines will make *estimated* $ 36 billion this year through ancillary fees for bags , other services
fees for credit card usage , extra *leg* room and *window* or aisle seats are likely to continue
