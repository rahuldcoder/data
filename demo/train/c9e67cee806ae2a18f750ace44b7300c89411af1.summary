an emphatic @entity0 talks to police , gesturing with his arms to make his point			1
eventually , police move in as @entity0 raises both hands in the air and tells them not to touch him			2
one officer reaches for @entity0 's hand ; seconds later , another officer wraps his arm around @entity0 's neck			1
cellphone video shot by a friend of @entity0 's shows the officer maintaining that hold as @entity0 is taken to the ground , crying out , " i ca n't breathe , i ca n't breathe , i ca n't breathe , " over and over again			1
and @entity0 never gets up			2
a grand jury has decided that there 's no probable cause to indict officer @entity20 , the man who put @entity0 in that chokehold on a @entity23 sidewalk , in the 43 - year - old 's death			1
but that judgment certainly does n't end the debate about what @entity28 did -- not just whether it was a criminal act , but whether it was necessary and in violation of the @entity33 's own policies			0
in an interview in august with @entity38 's @entity37 , @entity35 police commissioner @entity34 said that no local laws criminalize chokeholds , though they are prohibited by his department			1
in fact , the @entity33 could discipline @entity28 or his fellow officers if an ongoing internal review finds their actions did not align with police department procedures			2
yet @entity34 has also cautioned against a rush to judgment			0
" i 've been around a long time in this business , " he noted , adding that " what it appears to be sometimes may not be what it is			0
" medical examiner noted chokehold , other factors watching the video , a few things stand out			0
for one , @entity0 is clearly the biggest man in the shot			2
he 's also outnumbered by police officers			1
the @entity35 medical examiner 's office also offered pertinent facts when it classified @entity0 's death as a homicide this summer			1
he died because of a " compression of neck ( chokehold ) , compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police , " the office found , while also calling @entity0 's " acute and chronic bronchial asthma , obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease " contributing factors			1
in other words , there was a chokehold , and it played a part in @entity0 's death			1
which raises the question : should the chokehold have been used at all ? the answer depends -- as it has with many aspects of this case , which has spurred large protests in @entity35 and beyond -- on who you ask			2
for @entity0 's family , and the thousands who protested wednesday night in support of them , there 's no doubt : the police officer 's actions , including the chokehold , were uncalled for			1
" i do n't know what video they were looking at , " said @entity0 's mother , @entity99			1
" evidently , it was n't the same one that the rest of the world was looking at			0
" a family lawyer , @entity105 , said that @entity0 should have gotten at most a summons to appear in court for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes , and he should n't have been treated as he was			2
" ( the officer ) clearly was violating his own departmental regulations , " @entity105 said of @entity28 's chokehold			2
" he clearly was using excessive force			0
" forensic expert : @entity114 can be deadly @entity115 , a forensic scientist and professor at @entity35 's @entity117 , says that the chokehold he saw in the @entity0 video had the potential to be deadly			1
it seemingly cuts off the airway , which can lead to a condition called asphyxia -- which includes unconsciousness and suffocation , by cutting off one 's oxygen supply -- " and ultimately cardiac arrest and death			2
" " it 's a very dangerous chokehold , because you can damage the very delicate structures in the throat , " @entity115 told @entity38			2
" ... there are a lot of things police can do to prevent something like this			0
" before he became an assistant director with the @entity143 and , now , a @entity38 law enforcement analyst , @entity141 was a police officer			1
he was never taught the hold that @entity28 used , but he was instructed how to " to put pressure on both sides of the carotid artery to cut off blood flow to the brain or reduce it until the person fainted			0
" " it supposedly did no permanent damage , " @entity141 said			0
but many police departments , like in @entity35 , decided to prohibit such chokeholds " because it was so easy to misapply it and put pressure directly on the throat , directly choking the person cutting off air as opposed to making them faint			1
" as @entity141 explained , " it was just too easy to have an accident			0
" ' at a certain point , they 've got to touch him ' yet this does n't mean the former @entity143 assistant director or other law enforcement experts believe @entity20 should be charged or even disciplined for what he did to @entity0			1
@entity141 says , from the video , it looks to him that the officer " is trying to bring him down and , in the process of holding him , he does have his forearm across his throat and is choking him			0
" the @entity38 analyst also says people should put themselves in the police officers ' shoes			1
how long can they wait to arrest someone , whether they are accused of murder or something relatively minor ? and , if a person does not comply , what can they do -- let him go or step in , perhaps using force ? " at a certain point , they 've got to touch him , " @entity141 said			2
" that 's just the way it goes			0
and when you resist arrest -- physically resist -- bad things can happen			0
" that point was echoed by @entity199 , a former @entity33 detective and police academy instructor			0
he told @entity38 that , after @entity0 was told he 'd be arrested but would not comply , " that debate is not going to go on for hours on end			0
" " i do n't know of any other officer that would have really done all that much different , " @entity199 said			0
" if you monday - morning - quarterback this situation , anyone could come up with 1,000 different ways that they think they could have handled it at that time and place ... ( but ) people make certain choices when they 're interacting with police			0
" legal analyst : system ' designed for officer safety ' this story is not over			0
the @entity221 , under the direction of attorney general @entity220 , has launched a civil rights investigation into @entity0 's death			1
( @entity0 was black and @entity28 is white , the same racial breakdown as in the fatal shooting of @entity226 by then - @entity228 police officer @entity227 -- a case that also triggered widespread protests and did not result in a grand jury indictment			1
) president @entity232 has weighed in as well , saying , " we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and a strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and law enforcement			0
" and , as @entity34 told @entity38 , " if there 's a finding of guilt " in the @entity33 's review of @entity0 's death , " a decision will be made as to an appropriate penalty or discipline			1
" yet @entity247 , a veteran defense attorney and @entity38 legal analyst , noted that the grand jury decided not to indict @entity28 because jurors could n't agree that there was enough evidence to say he " acted in a criminally negligent way			1
" changing the law -- perhaps to bar chokeholds or put tighter restrictions on police when they try to arrest someone -- could affect future cases like that of @entity0			1
but as it stands now , defense attorney and @entity38 analyst @entity262 said , the current system is not set up that way			0
" once ( police ) make an arrest , everything is designed for officer safety , " @entity262 said			2
" and if a person does n't immediately comply , then they can move right up the force continuum as needed			0
that 's the way they 're trained			0
