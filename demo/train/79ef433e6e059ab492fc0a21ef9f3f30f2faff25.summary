-- @entity1 has just pulled 21 popular free apps from the @entity3			1
according to the company , the apps are malware aimed at getting root access to the user 's device , gathering a wide range of available data , and downloading more code to it without the user 's knowledge			1
although @entity1 has swiftly removed the apps after being notified ( by the ever - vigilant " @entity19 " bloggers ) , the apps in question have already been downloaded by at least 50,000 @entity3 users			1
the apps are particularly insidious because they look just like knockoff versions of already popular apps			1
for example , there 's an app called simply " @entity27			0
" the user would download what he 'd assume to be a chess game , only to be presented with a very different sort of app. these apps are all pirated versions of popular games and utilities -- an expeditious solution for busy hackers			2
once downloaded , the apps root the user 's device using a method like rageagainstthecage , then use an @entity3 executable file ( @entity45 ) to nab user and device data , such as your mobile provider and user id			1
finally , the app acts as a wide - open backdoor for your device to quietly download more malicious code			0
below is a partial list of the bad apps , all of which were made by an entity called @entity62			0
if you 've downloaded one of these apps , it might be best to take your device to your carrier and exchange it for a new one , since you ca n't be sure that your device and user information is truly secure			2
considering how much we do on our phones -- shopping and mobile banking included -- it 's better to take precautions			0
