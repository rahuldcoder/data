-- it 's one of the most familiar pieces of advice from authorities to people in the path of a tornado : get into your basement			0
yet few homes in the @entity12 area have them -- even though that state is hit by far more powerful tornadoes than most others			1
" probably less than one tenth of one percent " of the houses in @entity20 are built with basements , said @entity21 , president of @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity12			1
" there 's just such a misconception that you can not do it			0
" why ? @entity21 cited the area 's high groundwater levels and heavy clay as among the reasons some people believe -- wrongly , he said -- that basements are tough to construct			1
but improved waterproofing methods can obviate the first ; and the second , too , is surmountable , according to @entity21 , who said he has built more than 600 basements in the @entity12 area over the past 15 years			1
" we do ' em all day long , " he said			1
" i 've got 32 basements to put in the ground right now			1
" the city of @entity20 was the epicenter of an @entity44 tornado monday that decimated neighborhoods in the @entity12 area , leaving at least 24 dead			1
inside a tornado - ravaged school in @entity20 , other issues can dissuade new home buyers from investing in basements , @entity21 said			2
one is that there are so few other such houses that comparable values are tough to estimate , " so appraisers do n't give you any credit			0
" in fact , basements are so rare in the area that real estate listings do not include " basement " as an option under foundation types , he said			1
" you can list it in the comments section , but that 's not a foundation type			0
" that means it 's hard for house hunters to narrow their searches to houses with basements , which makes it harder still for sellers who have built houses with basements to recoup their investments , he said			1
@entity20 in bull 's - eye twice , science may know why @entity82 , a custom homebuilder in the area for 37 years , estimated that some 2 % of residents have basements , and 10 % to 15 % " have some kind of cellar			1
" none of the homes in his partially completed , 51 - house development , called @entity93 , has a basement , he said			0
though it was spared monday 's storms , " a block north of us it looks like @entity100 , " he said			0
he plans to build a community shelter that would accommodate all of its residents			0
alternatives exist : an above - ground shelter runs $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 ; a small basement would cost $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 ; and a concrete cellar built during new - house construction would cost as little as $ 2,200 , said @entity82			1
tornado prediction is improving , scientists say accessibility an important element basements provide good protection if equipped with a suitable door and a concrete roof , but basements of pier - beam houses would leave their occupants exposed and vulnerable if the structure above them were blown away , said @entity121 , a former professor of civil engineering at @entity123 @entity121 created the concept of the above - ground storm shelter after a tornado swept through @entity127 , @entity128 , in 1970 , killing 26 people and demolishing scores of homes			2
@entity44 tornadoes are terrifying perfect storms in addition , it is difficult to make basements compliant with the @entity137 , said @entity121 , who is on the research faculty at the school 's @entity139			2
above - ground storm shelters are easy to make accessible to those who are physically challenged , " and i would say that accessibility is a very important element , " @entity121 said			0
specially reinforced safe rooms provide " near absolute occupant protection from even the worst - case tornado , " he said			1
opinion : how can we be safe from tornadoes ? other products include steel , concrete and plastic shelters ; above - ground and below - ground shelters ; indoor and outdoor shelters ; and shelters that fit underneath the garage slab			2
the extra cost of incorporating a basement into plans for a house depends on where it is being built			2
" if you 're in the colder climates , then one has to put the foundation walls several feet deep to get below the frost line , " @entity121 said			1
a region 's frost line marks where the ground no longer freezes and is an important variable when installing pipes			1
the added cost of digging down the extra couple of feet needed to make a basement for a house in the @entity179 is relatively small , he said			1
" if you 're that deep , you 're pretty well along forming the shell for the basement			2
" but in the @entity184 , where the frost line is only about 18 inches below ground , the added incremental cost of digging out a basement would be far steeper , said the @entity128			1
" here , houses are typically built by placing a slab on the surface and building above it			2
" opinion : the making of a nightmare tornado lessons to be learned @entity121 is also executive director of the @entity194 , a nonprofit group that focuses on improving the quality of storm shelters			0
he was planning tuesday to organize teams to travel to @entity20 to study which structures failed and which performed well			0
" there 's a lot of lessons we can learn from this , " he said			0
@entity121 said he had heard news reports citing underground shelters as the only safe places monday in @entity20			2
" that causes my blood to curdle , because i 've spent my career developing safe places above ground , " he said			0
monday 's disaster is expected to lead to renewed calls to ensure that new houses are equipped with some sort of protection , said @entity218 , president and ceo of the @entity220			0
but do n't count on them to effect change			0
" what happens is that time and fading memories are the worst enemies , " she said			0
" people think it ca n't happen twice , but in the case of @entity20 , @entity232 , the tragedy here is this is the third strike -- 1999 to 2003			0
" after each of those strikes , homebuilders pledged never again to build homes without including safe rooms , she said			1
though many followed through on their vows , more work remains , she noted			0
opinion : we love and fear the @entity232 skies			0

misconceptions abound over basements , builders say
" we do ' em all day long , " says one who has built many in the @entity12 area
deeper frost line means they 're common in the @entity179
alternatives , including safe rooms , exist
