@entity0 -- partisan tempers flared at a @entity4 immigration hearing on monday as top @entity5 accused opponents of comprehensive reform legislation of using last week 's @entity9 bombings to slow or even derail the bill			1
" last week , opponents of comprehensive immigration reform began to exploit the @entity16 , " said @entity12 chairman @entity11 , @entity13			1
" i urge restraint in that regard			0
... let no one be so cruel as to try to use the heinous attacks of these two young men last week to derail the dreams and futures of millions of hard - working people , " @entity11 added			2
he said the bill crafted by the bipartisan " @entity32 " would " serve to strengthen our national security by allowing us to focus our border security and enforcement efforts against those who would do us harm			0
" " a nation as strong as ours can welcome the oppressed and persecuted without making compromises in our security , " he said			0
" we are capable of vigilance in our pursuit of these values , and we have seen the tremendous work that the local law enforcement as well as the federal law enforcement have done in the @entity43 area , and i am so proud of them			0
" @entity43 bombings cast shadow on immigration debate @entity11 's statement , delivered at the start of the hearing , was met with a sharp response from the panel 's top @entity52			1
" i want you to take note of the fact that when you proposed gun legislation , i did n't accuse you of using the ( @entity61 , @entity62 , ) killings as an excuse , " said sen. @entity54 , @entity55			1
" i do n't hear any criticism ... when there ( were ) 14 people killed in @entity67 , @entity68 , and ( some political activists took ) advantage of that tragedy to warn about more government action to make sure that fertilizer factories are safe , " @entity54 said			0
" i think we are taking advantage of an opportunity when , once in 25 years we deal with immigration , to make sure that every base is covered , " he added			0
@entity54 became visibly agitated later in the hearing when sen. @entity80 , @entity82 - @entity81 , said " those who are pointing to what happened -- the terrible tragedy in @entity43 -- ( are looking for an ) excuse for not doing a bill or delaying it many months or a year			1
" " i never said that ! " @entity54 yelled in response , interrupting @entity80			2
" i did n't say you did , sir , " @entity80 replied			0
" i did n't mean you , mr. @entity54			0
" @entity93 sen. @entity92 then accused @entity80 of " demeaning " anti-reform witnesses at the hearing , partly by characterizing them as representatives of narrow interests			1
@entity80 , in turn , insisted that " what i am saying is , if there are things that come up as a result of what happened in @entity43 that need improving , that require improvement , let 's add them to the bill because certainly our bill tightens up things in a way that would make a @entity43 less likely			1
" opinion : @entity43 bombing should n't derail immigration reform " that is all i am saying , " @entity80 concluded , " because i have heard lots of calls from people out in the country saying delay it			1
" separately , sen. @entity120 , @entity121 , sent a letter monday to senate majority leader @entity123 , @entity124 , urging a delay of any immigration legislation until more is learned about the alleged @entity43 bombers			1
" we should not proceed until we understand the specific failures of our immigration system , " @entity120 wrote			2
" why did the current system allow two individuals to immigrate to the @entity133 from ... an area known as a hotbed of @entity137 extremism , who then committed acts of terrorism ? " asked about the letter , @entity142 press secretary @entity141 dismissed @entity120 's concern , arguing that " comprehensive immigration reform , as anyone who has looked into it can attest , would enhance our security			1
" among other things , the bill now under consideration would prevent undocumented residents from gaining legal status if they have been found guilty of felonies or more than two misdemeanors			0
monday 's hearing was the second by the @entity12 on the nearly 900 - page proposal put together by the eight senators			0
over twenty witnesses were slated to testify , a schedule characterized by @entity92 as part of a plan " to rush through this massive legislation before the @entity133 people know what 's in it			0
" opinion : do n't blame immigration for @entity43 bombings the first hearing , held last friday , was also marked by several references to security fears raised by the recent bombings			2
homeland security secretary @entity175 is scheduled to testify before the panel tuesday			0
assuming the immigration bill clears @entity11 's committee , full @entity4 consideration of the legislation will probably occur in june , according to multiple sources			1
a bipartisan group of legislators in the @entity184 is crafting its own immigration reform proposal .			2
