-- @entity2 's efforts to secure a critical $ 4.8bn loan from the @entity4 have run into fresh difficulty , possibly leading the government to seek emergency financing to avoid economic collapse			1
the @entity4 has expressed reservations over a government economic plan needed to seal an agreement that has been in the works , for almost two years , according to people familiar with the negotiations			1
at a time when @entity2 's foreign reserves have reached $ 13.5bn -- below the critical level of three months of imports -- @entity19 favours a gradual approach to reform even as it is forced to cut its imports of fuel and wheat			1
another complicating factor in @entity4 negotiations is the fact that @entity28 , the @entity29 president , is reluctant to introduce measures such as a sales tax ahead of parliamentary elections			1
the poll that had been scheduled to start in april but finish in june has now been further delayed			0
a court ordered the suspension of the election schedule until the electoral law is reviewed by the @entity38 , which could take several weeks			0
fearful of provoking social unrest at a time of political instability , the @entity2 programme favours small and hesitant steps towards the implementation of austerity measures aimed at raising additional revenue for the state and reducing energy subsidies that eat up a quarter of the budget			2
the @entity4 , however , has informed @entity19 that its proposed economic reform programme is not sufficiently robust			1
@entity52 , director of the @entity53 and @entity54 at the @entity4 , would not comment on the negotiations with @entity19 , saying only that " the @entity4 view is that the programme has to have the desired impact on confidence ... [ and ] needs to have strong measures to address @entity2 's broader economic problems "			1
with the prospect of an @entity4 agreement receding , analysts say a bridge finance package might be put together by the @entity4 with other donors to tide @entity19 over until after the @entity67 , the planning minister , played down the idea on sunday , adding that broad structural measures were needed			1
without a reform programme , bridging financing would in any case do little to restore investor confidence			0
" any extra funds will help @entity2 buy time , " said @entity74 , @entity2 economist at @entity75 , the regional investment bank			2
" but the failure to agree an @entity4 programme will send a negative signal to all those investors waiting for hints of real action on the ground to reform the economy			2
" the much deferred agreement with the @entity4 was expected to unlock up to $ 9.5bn of additional finance from other external sources			2
the reform programme @entity2 proposed to the @entity4 targets a reduction of the deficit from 10.9 per cent of gross domestic product in the current june fiscal year , to 9.5 per cent in the next year			1
according to @entity2 officials , the economic programme envisions immediate increases to the sales tax , but only on six items			2
these are cigarettes , alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages , telecoms , cement and steel			0
it aims to introduce a fully fledged value added tax by the spring of 2013			0
it stipulates raising the price of fuel to industry to international levels over three years			0
the government has already twice increased the price of diesel and natural gas to some energy - intensive industries , though prices to motorists and domestic consumers remain the same			0
@entity119 , a senior ministry of finance official , told the @entity0 that with the latest increases , the fuel subsidy bill for the june 2013 fiscal year would be about $ 15bn , but that if no further cuts were introduced , the cost of the subsidy next year would rise to $ 22bn			0
" the programme deals with the short - term and immediate challenges and builds the foundations for more medium - term reforms , " said mr @entity119			0
