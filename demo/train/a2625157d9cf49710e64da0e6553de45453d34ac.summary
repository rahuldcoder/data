@entity0 , @entity1 -- in rural @entity1 , all it takes is a few minutes for tons of heavy mud to plow into a vulnerable hillside community and swallow its people and their homes			1
sometimes , the devastation is there for all to see			0
" i met a couple who lost their children and their home ... all of it just gone , " @entity11 said , recalling a trip to the country in 2005			1
" we arrived , and it was hard to believe anyone had died			0
there were n't bodies lying around			0
... they were buried under			0
" hundreds of dangerous mudslides occur every year during @entity1 's rainy season , which lasts from mid-may until october or november			1
in one extreme case , a mudslide resulted in 700 deaths , according to @entity31 , the @entity32			2
there are plenty of natural reasons why @entity1 are vulnerable to mudslides : frequent earthquakes , hurricanes and heavy rains oversaturate @entity1 's mountainous terrain and muddy the soil			1
but @entity11 said there 's another mudslide trigger to consider			1
" deforestation -- or the absence of trees -- causes mudslides to occur , " said @entity11 , co-founder of the @entity44 , a nonprofit trying to help the villagers protect themselves from mudslides			1
" trees are cut for firewood and to make room for the crops , and without realizing it ... they 've taken away their protection			1
where it used to be rainforest becomes an open space for the mud to come right on through			2
" nearly 373 square kilometers of trees are destroyed each year in @entity1 , according to the university of @entity65 's @entity64			1
through her group 's efforts , @entity11 is inspiring villagers to stop chopping and , instead , use trees to safeguard their lives and crops against mudslides			1
the effort , nearly 20 years strong , was one @entity11 said she never really planned			1
a political science professor at @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity11 traveled to the rural town of @entity79 , @entity1 , in 1991 as an adviser for a university field trip			1
it was her first trip outside the @entity83 , and despite not being able to speak @entity84 , she was moved by a blatant poverty that " broke her heart " and birthed a " new purpose			0
" " i went into the villages where lots of the trees were cut down , and i held some of the children , " said @entity11 , 57			1
" they were listless and could n't hold themselves up			0
their eyes were dull , and it became pretty clear that they were malnourished			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity102 the farms she visited were not sustainable , she said , because the soil was eroded and lacked nutrients			1
@entity11 , a self - proclaimed nature lover , was not formally trained in agriculture , but she knew some basic facts about trees and food products that could be cheaply grown			1
with the help of a former student , she researched rural resources and learned that many local @entity1 tree varieties could be strategically replanted to provide fruit , fertilizer , coffee , food and medicinal herbs where resources were failing or nonexistent			1
" when we started , it was all about fighting poverty , " @entity11 said			1
" we wanted to help families farm better and feed their children better			0
but we started to notice that in the areas where ( pine ) trees were planted , the mudslides were no longer occurring			2
so that brought a new focus for us			0
food , shade , fertilizer and mudslide protection -- the trees can do it all			1
" not all trees that are planted can protect against mudslides , but @entity11 said pine trees planted on high mountain slopes can be most effective			1
pine trees have long , anchoring tap roots that can extend 6 meters below the soil			2
when they are planted in slopes above residential areas , @entity11 explained , heavy rains are unlikely to loosen their grip on the soil			1
" we learned the hard way that without trees , we are at risk , and our land is at risk , " said @entity148 , a lemon farmer and @entity44 program participant			2
@entity148 , 53 , has lost family and friends to mudslide disasters , and he now attributes his life and the success of his farm to @entity11 's nonprofit			1
" the trees give us life , " he said			2
" if there is too much rain , they keep the soil			0
and the mountainside does n't fall down anymore			0
" constant land surveys , particularly during the rainy season , help @entity11 and her team identify which rural areas need assistance			1
but the easiest way to determine which village to target next , @entity11 said , is simply " to answer the door			1
" " they 're coming to us directly now to ask for help , " @entity11 said			1
" people know us , and now they trust us			0
" local @entity1 staff -- all trained agroforestry technicians -- are assigned six villages each and provide free weekly instructional courses on topics like tree planting , sustainable farming and air quality			1
each technician remains in his or her assigned communities for five years			0
@entity11 credits her group 's success to this commitment of staying within a community until the community itself can see and reap benefits			1
" it 's a lot of work , " @entity11 said			2
" we do n't come in , plant some trees and leave			2
we do that , and they 'll cut them down			0
it 's a step - by - step process that starts with education			2
in a little time , they notice their crops are doing better ; mudslides are n't happening			0
and the behavior changes : they start to protect the trees			2
we say : ' all right , you 've got it			0
you know how to do this now			0
' then we leave ... on to the next village			0
" the @entity44 has helped 110 rural villages plant more than 3.8 million trees throughout @entity1			1
as an added incentive for attending classes and planting trees , the group donates and installs ecofriendly , fuel - efficient cooking stoves to some program participants based on economic need			1
these stoves require very little firewood and give off no emissions			0
with the stoves , not only are fewer trees cut down , but families no longer inhale dangerous fumes caused by stovetop , chimney-less cooking			2
the group also provides educational resources and promotes economic independence within communities			1
its agroforestry textbook series has been adopted by more than 200 @entity1 schools			2
hundreds of women have also benefited from the rural farming initiative			0
they help generate income for their families from the sale of fruits , salves and shampoos created from trees and fruits they learned to harvest			0
" i learned so much from @entity44 and from @entity11 , " @entity259 said			2
" we 're 50 women in our village working together			0
... we come together and plant in the tree nurseries or pack the products , and we support each other			0
it is a lot of work , but we enjoy it very much			0
without the program , some of us would not learn anything			0
" although @entity11 remains a full - time university professor , she spends all of her free time in @entity1			1
after 40 visits , she is happy with the progress of the program and vows to keep returning to the " place where her heart remains			0
" " i can go back to areas that were nothing but mudslides and soil erosion , and now i see forest , " @entity11 said			2
" this is not just a project			0
it 's about building the community and saving the planet			0
... it 's about a better future for the children			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity294 website at www.air-guatemala.org and see how to help .			0
