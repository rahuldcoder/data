an editorial cartoon in a @entity0 daily sums up @entity3 's state of affairs : a scribbled mess of spirals			1
and the presidential election this weekend , once hailed as @entity3 's big step toward democracy , is now satirized in an online mock - up of a video game pitting a bare - chested @entity24 , the last prime minister under ousted president @entity25 , against the bearded @entity26 of the @entity27			1
the runoff vote is taking place after the @entity30 declared the parliament invalid and triggered renewed chaos over the country 's leadership			1
the ruling dealt a blow to the @entity27 , which dominated parliament , and was victory for supporters of @entity24 , the focus of protesters ' derision for his ties to the deposed dictator			1

rankled revolutionaries felt left out in the cold on a hot june day			0
the dissolution of parliament gives the @entity53 , or @entity53 , full legislative and executive power alongside , it appears , a friendly judiciary			1

" @entity63 , a founder of the @entity64 , which played a prominent role in last year 's @entity67 uprising , called the ruling " provocative			1
" the contentious verdict , he told the @entity71 news website @entity72 , will " pave the way for the reanimation of the ousted @entity25 regime			0
" the court dissolved parliament after it had been in session for a little more that four months , saying that constitutional articles that regulated the parliamentary elections were invalid			1
@entity53 , which has been in control of the country since @entity25 's ouster , claimed full legislative power			0
many view the move as a " soft coup " staged by @entity3 's powerful military , a move intended to diminish the power of the @entity91 , who have long been held under the military 's microscope			1

" legislative powers have been transferred to the @entity53 because of the @entity115 ' selfishness , " she said			0
" they made us lose the revolution , and they lost everything			2
" after the ruling , speculation rose that @entity26 , the @entity27 's candidate , would pull out now that his party 's pillar of power had crumbled			2
but @entity26 said he will stay in the running , though the notion of carrying on a vote under the circumstances seemed absurd to some			2
in the absence of a parliament , the winner of the runoff vote will be put in a position of dealing directly with @entity3 's military leaders , a reason for @entity53 to postpone the elections , said @entity139 , a 2005 @entity140 laureate whose own presidential bid failed			1
" electing president in the absence of constitution and parliament is electing an ' emperor ' with more powers than deposed dictator			2
a travesty , " he tweeted friday			2
@entity150 hoped the election process would proceed peacefully			0
" and i hope that the voter chooses the person who will achieve the goals of the revolution , " he said			2

already , protesters were amassing in the @entity161 city of @entity162			0
the april 6 movement took to @entity164 to motivate protesters			0
" we are now back at the crossroads and perhaps at the point of zero			0
martial law under the disguise of legality , " it said			0
" the @entity27 proved beyond a reasonable doubt that they are incapable of understanding history , refuse to learn from their mistakes , and have a level of arrogance that makes them unable to accept advice			0

and military police in checkpoints and around parliament ! ummm , " wrote @ @entity188			1
@entity189 , the former @entity190 executive who attained fame after being arrested during the uprising , said : " the only thing that will make us go back to living in fear , oppression and silence is a time machine -- they have n't invented that yet			0
" many @entity3 , emboldened to speak their minds now more than ever , felt alienated by both the @entity27 and their other choice : a remnant of the old regime			1
" both choices are unacceptable to me , " said @entity63 , a civil servant			0
" i will be boycotting			0
" university student @entity205 has become an online sensation with his satirical music videos			0
in one , he takes aim at the @entity27			0
" this is our country , but you were all sleeping , " he sings			0
" we took parliament and the constitutional assembly , and we 'll take the presidency , too			2
and if you do n't like it , you can go to hell			0
" humor has long been a form of dissent in @entity3 , @entity205 says			1
whenever things get tense , he says , @entity3 try to cope by making fun			1
