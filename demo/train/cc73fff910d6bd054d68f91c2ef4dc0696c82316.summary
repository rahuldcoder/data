for soccer 's world governing body @entity1 , it is an unwanted hat - trick			0
@entity3 , who will stage the 2014 installment of @entity1 's showpiece tournament -- the @entity6 -- faced a wave of protests about the costs involved in playing host when the forerunner to the tournament , the @entity12 , took place in june			1
recently @entity1 have also appointed a task force to examine the possibility of moving the date of @entity17 to escape the searing temperatures of the tiny emirate 's @entity19 summer			0
sandwiched in between those two is @entity21 2018 , who are again having to field accusations of racism among supporters of one of their biggest clubs			1
@entity29 's @entity28 claims he was the subject of monkey chants from @entity33 fans during their @entity35 game on wednesday and even raised the possibility of boycotting the 2018 @entity6			1
@entity38 international toure declared himself " furious " and in an interview with @entity29 's tv channel called on @entity41 -- @entity44 football 's governing body -- to impose tough sanctions on @entity33 , and " ban them for a couple of years			2
" while @entity41 confirmed they 'd opened disciplinary proceedings against @entity33 for " racist behavior of their fans " after reports submitted from their two officials at the match , the club denies any allegations of racist behavior , and claim that @entity41 's delegate did n't hear anything untoward			1
@entity28 's @entity38 teammate @entity60 , who played in the match for @entity33 , said he had heard nothing in the way of monkey chants and told the club 's official website toure " clearly got worked up			1
" @entity60 distanced himself from those comments on friday , saying he had n't spoken to any journalists after the game			0
whatever the outcome , the furore has provoked another wave of negative headlines about the @entity6 and brought the issue of racial discrimination into sharp focus			2
@entity3 's @entity6 winning defender @entity77 twice had a banana thrown at him from the stands in 2011 when playing for @entity80 in the volatile @entity82 region while @entity83 were forced to distance themselves from a fans group who called for non-white and gay players to be excluded from the team			1
however , it is arguable that racism is way down the 2018 committee 's to do list of priorities			2
" there is still this attitude in @entity21 that the 2018 @entity6 is a long way away and they have got all sorts of problems they need to tackle before they even get to the issue of racism , " @entity94 , a @entity95 - based football journalist told @entity96			1
" i think the organizing committee for the 2018 @entity6 has probably taken the decision that @entity1 are much more concerned that the stadiums are n't going to be built , the roads will be bad and the railway links are n't going to be there by the time 2018 comes around			1
" while @entity1 president @entity111 declared himself happy with @entity21 's preparations at a recent summit in @entity114 , @entity94 argues infrastructure development remains a huge concern			1
" so if a few thousand fans -- and i 'm not trying to diminish the issue -- but if a few thousand fans air these chants in a @entity35 game in the year 2013 , they are pretty confident they can sweep that under the carpet , but they 've got to get the transport , logistics and stadiums in order			0
" there are 14 or 15 host stadiums , how many of them are ready today ? none , not a single one			0
some of them are built but need renovating ; some have n't even been built yet			0
" that is where @entity1 can say we literally ca n't hold a major tournament here if you do n't have stadiums or roads , so that is where the prime motivation is at the moment			0
" to even get to the point where they can say ' @entity147 , we 've solved that problem ' they are years away			0
" @entity21 's organizing committee has insisted all stakeholders in @entity21 football have made it clear there is no place for racism in the game			1
it also pointed to a new ' @entity159 ' , ratified by president @entity160 in july , that bolsters the sanctions available to the authorities when dealing with hooliganism by @entity21 fans , like stadium bans and harsher fines			2
" what is clear is that football is uniquely positioned to educate fans in combating this global issue , " said the @entity21 organizing committee in a statement sent to @entity96			2
" the 2018 @entity6 in @entity21 , in particular , can act as a catalyst to positively change the mindsets and behavior across all involved in @entity21 football over the next four years			1
" @entity175 that was recently passed into legislation shows @entity21 's determination to eradicate the problem for good			1
the 2018 @entity6 in @entity21 will be a festival of football where talented athletes from every corner of the globe will be celebrated			1
" asked if infrastructure projects were being prioritized ahead of tackling discrimination , the organizing committee declined to comment further			1
outside of @entity21 , condemnation of the alleged monkey chants aimed at @entity28 was rapid , with the @entity188 in @entity189 calling for swift action and the " strongest possible sanctions			1
" the worldwide professional players ' union @entity192 said @entity41 's own racism protocol " failed " @entity28			1
@entity192 argued that after the 30 - year - old @entity38 told referee @entity195 of the alleged abuse , the official should have informed the safety officer to ensure a stadium announcement was made imploring fans to curtail their chants			0
if they persisted , the teams should then have been taken off the field			0
on friday , @entity41 president @entity203 ordered an investigation into why the protocol was n't followed			0
the @entity206 ' kick it out ' campaign against racism called the incident a " depressing throwback " and said it raised questions around the suitability of @entity21 as @entity6 hosts			1
however , one seasoned racism campaigner , @entity216 , executive director of the @entity217 ( @entity217 ) organisation , said it was unlikely that @entity1 would consider replacing @entity21 as the host nation unless there was a wide scale boycott by the players involved			2
" i 'm very confident that when it comes to the @entity6 , the government , the football authorities will make sure that in terms of racism it 's a very clean @entity6 -- i do n't think that is in doubt , " he told @entity96			1
@entity96 investigates : racism in football " generally when these big tournaments take place the country rises to the occasion and people understand their responsibilities			0
" i think the wider issue is the one that @entity28 has highlighted , which is that if the government and the football authorities in @entity21 ca n't come to terms with this , then should the @entity6 be played there ? " i think it 's probably too late for that but he also raises the prospect of players boycotting the tournament , that has never happened before and in the end if the @entity251 players were to do that then there would n't be a @entity6			1
" one of the most high - profile footballers ever to play in @entity21 was @entity255 striker @entity254 , twice a @entity35 winner with @entity256 and a four - time @entity257			2
he spent two years with @entity80 , playing a season alongside @entity77 , and told @entity96 recently that in his experience of @entity21 , the ultras there are no more or less racist than in other countries			2
" @entity217 was n't born in @entity21 , " said @entity264 striker @entity254			0
" the first time i played in @entity266 , a lot of people told me , " whoa , watch out there , " when i came out onto the pitch to warm up , the fans stood up and applauded me			0
" racism is a question of education -- you get to one place and , in the moment , they do it to you			0
or a lot of times , in the stadium , they do it to certain players -- not to offend you -- but to make you lose your concentration			0
" and i 'll tell you what , same as they said about the @entity6 in @entity288 , @entity21 will be one of the best @entity289 we 'll ever have			2
" yet @entity94 insists there wo n't be an appetite to fight racism head on in @entity21 until the punishments meted out to clubs do them real damage			2
" futile is the word for potential punishments because there is no fear of any serious consequences , " said @entity94			0
" it has to be something on the horizon that is immediate and would affect all fans			0
" there are certain things i think @entity41 could do that might make a lot of @entity21 fans sit up and take note that would involve banning their clubs from playing in @entity41 or a serious sanction involving next year 's @entity6			1
" what is key for the clubs is television revenue and the prize money they get from competing in @entity41			0
as far as they are concerned fan behavior is an inconvenience but it is n't the be all and end all			0
" what would affect them is if they were barred from competition and therefore could n't get that revenue			0
