@entity0 -- his fur is worn in places , his nose is rather threadbare and he 's a little saggy round the middle			0
but staff at @entity8 in the west of @entity10 believe the elderly teddy bear left in the departure lounge more than a year ago , along with a photograph dated 1918 , must have a loving family somewhere			1
the picture , produced as a postcard from the studio of @entity18 , shows a teddy with two small children in light dresses			1
the older one , her hair tied in ribbons , has her arm around the bear			2
on the back is written : " with dearest love and kisses to our darling @entity31 from your loving little daughter & @entity34			0
" also written is : " taken on baby 's birthday march 4 1918 , one year and 5 months old			1
