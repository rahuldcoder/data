-- apparently the @entity1 is a much better training ground for the box office than @entity4 , as " @entity9 " had no trouble fending off @entity7 's expensive new sci - fi arrival " @entity8			1
" @entity14 's " @entity9 " dropped a relatively mild 44 percent for $ 39.1 million in its second weekend -- a drop that virtually replicates the second - weekend decline of 45 percent for 2008â € ²s " dr. @entity16 " today " @entity9 " will pass " @entity18 " to become the year 's top grosser , finishing the weekend with a cumulative tally of nearly $ 122 million in just 10 days			1
but the real story here , of course , is " @entity8 , " which @entity7 infamously spent $ 250 million to produce			1
with that kind of price tag , " @entity8 " really needed to open to $ 50 million at a bare minimum			1
other films that reportedly cost around $ 250 million include " @entity27 3 , " " @entity28 and the @entity29 , " " @entity30 : on @entity33 , " and " @entity32 , " and those four movies debuted to an average of $ 99 million			1
" @entity8 , " on the other hand , collected an estimated $ 30.6 million this weekend			1
that 's slightly better than the $ 25 million or so that most in the industry were predicting , and would represent a solid start for many films			1
but it 's a dismal showing for such a costly project			0
both the movie and its marketing campaign are to blame for the soft opening			0
the film , which garnered mixed reviews and marked the first live - action undertaking for @entity49 's @entity48 ( " @entity50 , " " @entity51 " ) , is based on @entity54 author @entity53 ' 1917 book " a princess of @entity4			2
" that book was the first in a series of @entity60 sci - fi novels that later influenced films such as " @entity62 " and " @entity32			0
" however , since the general public is not overly familiar with the @entity60 works , " @entity8 " appeared derivative of the very things it inspired			2
also not helping the movie out was its cast , headed by an unproven @entity69 ( " @entity70 " )			0
true , " @entity32 " featured the similarly untested @entity71 , but @entity73 's name is as big as any movie star , and he at least surrounded @entity71 with some familiar faces like @entity76 and @entity77			0
the most familiar face in " @entity8 " was ... @entity79 ? but it 's really @entity7 's marketing that performed a disservice to the movie			1
for months , " @entity8 " suffered from muddled ads and trailers , none more misjudged than its @entity88 commercial , which wrongly assumed audiences were so familiar with the " @entity8 " brand that simply seeing the movie 's title would excite them			1
also hurting matters was the generic title , which @entity7 shortened from " @entity95 " with the reported belief that " of @entity4 " would turn off female moviegoers			0
but @entity4 is the project 's major selling point			0
without it , the movie became a sphinx to the general public			0
who is @entity8 ? where is he ? why can he leap great distances ? i understand the desire to not reveal too much of a film 's story , but these are basic questions that were n't answered by @entity7 's advertising until right before " @entity8 's " release			1
by then , it was too late			0
the film tilted toward men , whom @entity7 says comprised 63 percent of the audience			0
it also skewed a bit older than one might expect a @entity123 sci - fi adventure would , with 59 percent of the audience over age 25			2
showings in @entity125 represented 64 percent of the movie 's gross			2
and audiences generally liked " @entity8 , " with @entity130 participants giving it a " b + " rating			2
one @entity130 finding is particularly worth noting : only 8 percent of those polled said @entity69 was their reason for buying a ticket			0
compare that number to 72 percent for " @entity139 " star @entity138			0
the week 's two other new releases , " @entity141 " and " a @entity142 , " did n't make much of an impression			2
" @entity141 , " an r - rated shot - in - one - take horror flick starring @entity147 , debuted to a quiet $ 7 million and virtually tied " @entity145 " for fourth place			1
what it will be remembered for most , though , is its " f " @entity130 rating			0
" @entity141 " becomes the second film branded with the dreaded grade this year , joining " @entity154 " -- a @entity155 " now seems specifically reserved for horror films with unsatisfying endings			2
" a @entity142 , " which opened in sixth place with $ 6.4 million , was another misfire for star @entity159			0
the $ 40 million comedy was shot in 2008 and intended for a 2009 release , but was held up for three years when @entity163 split from @entity164			2
now , it has the distinction of joining @entity159 's other recent flops : 2008â € ²s " @entity168 " and 2009â € ²s " @entity169 , " which debuted to $ 5.3 million and $ 5.5 million , respectively			1
among holdovers , the @entity171 flick " @entity172 " fared surprisingly well , slipping only 45 percent for $ 11.6 million			1
that duplicates the trajectory of " @entity176 , " another " found - footage " film starring teenagers , which dropped 45 percent its second weekend			1
and " @entity145 " fell 48 percent for $ 7 million in its third weekend , pushing its total gross to $ 56.1 million			1
in limited release , the r - rated ensemble comedy " @entity192 , " starring @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , and a quarter of " bridesmaids " alums ( @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , and @entity190 ) , had a so - so debut with $ 2.2 million from 374 theaters			1
that equates to a per - location average of $ 5,799			0
the @entity199 - @entity198 romantic dramedy " @entity200 " reeled in $ 240,000 at 18 theaters , while the @entity204 - nominated @entity206 drama " footnote " took in $ 48,100 at two locations			0
" @entity9 " -- $ 39.1 mil 2			1
" @entity8 " -- $ 30.6 mil 3			1
" @entity172 " -- $ 11.6 mil 4			0
" @entity141 " -- $ 7.0 mil 4			2
