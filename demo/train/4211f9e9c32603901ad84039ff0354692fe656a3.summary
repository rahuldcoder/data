-- a @entity3 mural unseen since the 16th century may have been found hidden behind a fresco painted by another artist , art researchers in @entity7 , @entity1 said monday			1
@entity3 painted " @entity15 " on a wall of the @entity9 of the @entity10 , the seat of @entity7 government , in 1503 , but the masterpiece was lost during a restoration project 50 years later			1
the theory is that when artist @entity17 created his mural " @entity19 , " he erected a brick wall in front of @entity3 's plaster wall , effectively preserving the older masterpiece			2
" they told us we were looking on the wrong wall , that it was just a legend , " @entity7 mayor @entity24 said at a news conference monday , where researchers revealed the discovery of paint apparently matching pigment from @entity3 's " @entity30			1
" @entity3 's work was commissioned to commemorate the @entity7 's victory over @entity36 in the battle on the plain of @entity39 in 1440			1
while @entity3 was believed to have not been satisfied with the result , in which he used new techniques , art historians said it was a much - studied masterpiece in its day			0
museum finds earliest ' @entity30 ' copy the research team is led by the @entity48 and @entity50 's @entity49 , in partnership with the @entity52			2
" in name of the @entity52 , i ask the @entity1 government and the @entity56 and @entity57 to authorize us to verify how much of the masterpiece is there and if it 's worth it to bring it back to light , " mayor @entity24 said			1
researchers were allowed to drill six holes through the newer mural to reach the second wall			0
since they chose sections that had been restored by later artists , the holes did not damage @entity17 's original work			0
are there more lost @entity3 works ? an electron microscope identified chemicals in the paint as similar to black pigment found in brown glazes on @entity3 's " @entity30 " and " @entity79 , " according to professor @entity80 , who is working with @entity48			1
scans also shows flakes of red material unlikely to be on a plaster wall and beige material that " could only have been applied by a paint brush , " the researchers said			0
an air gap between the hidden plaster wall and the newer brick wall suggest that @entity17 may have tried to preserve @entity3 's mural , they said			2
" these data are very encouraging , " @entity80 said			0
the @entity93 will present " finding the @entity94 , " a documentary on the project , sunday , march 18			0
journalist @entity97 contributed to this report .			0

the mayor of @entity7 wants the @entity1 government to *approve* more study
