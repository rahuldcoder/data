-- an intellectually disabled construction worker was freed wednesday after nine years in a @entity3 prison , including four of them on death row , after his initial conviction for murdering a year - old infant was overturned			1
@entity8 , whose iq is 65 and who is functionally illiterate in his native @entity11 as well as @entity12 , was convicted in @entity13 in 2008 for murdering the year - old son of his then - girlfriend			1
but the @entity16 , which represented @entity17 in his appeal , said @entity17 was 1,000 miles away working construction in @entity20 when the child was injured			1
@entity17 's initial court - appointed attorneys failed to discover that evidence , and " after his conviction , @entity8 received the death penalty , largely because a state prison expert presented false testimony to persuade the jury that @entity8 would pose a danger to society if given life without parole instead , " the @entity16 said			1
on wednesday , an @entity16 attorney described @entity17 , now 49 , as an innocent man who was put on death row for a crime he did n't commit			1
" @entity8 never belonged in prison , let alone on death row waiting to be executed			2
he is indisputably innocent , " @entity40 of the @entity16 's @entity41 said in a statement			0
" my joy for him and his family today is tinged with sadness for the years our criminal justice system stole from him , all because he was too poor to afford better counsel than the lawyer the state appointed to him			0
" we should be ashamed of the errors that put @entity8 on the brink of execution			1
he is far from the only innocent person to receive a death sentence , " @entity40 said			1
@entity59 district attorney @entity58 called @entity40 's statement " factually inaccurate and full of half - truths			0
" " nowhere near the child " attorneys for the @entity16 contended that prosecutor 's medical expert 's records showed " clear proof that the head injuries the baby sustained occurred when @entity17 was nowhere near the child , " the @entity16 said			2
during the trial , @entity17 's court - appointed lawyer also failed to " discover and present the testimony of the many witnesses who said the girlfriend threw , hit , and dropped the baby and abused her children , while @entity8 was never physically rough and always peaceful , " the @entity16 said			1
@entity17 's attorney also " bungled his challenge to the typewritten statement that police persuaded @entity17 to sign , which said he had mistreated the child , " the @entity16 said			2
in fact , @entity17 was unable to read the statement , written in @entity12 , as he is functionally illiterate in both @entity12 and @entity11 , the @entity16 said			0
also , @entity17 ' primary language is @entity11 , and he is a seventh - grade dropout , the @entity16 said			2
child 's mother pleaded guilty the child 's mother , @entity90 , also was indicted for intentionally or knowingly causing the death of her son , @entity93 , by striking the boy 's head with a hand or unknown object or against a hard surface in october 2005 , according to court papers provided by the @entity16			1
@entity100 accepted " a plea bargain offer " and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of intentionally or knowingly causing bodily injury to her son , and she was sentenced to 10 years in prison , the court papers said			0
in exchange for the reduced charge , @entity100 agreed to testify against @entity17 , but stated that @entity17 did n't strike her son on the day he was rushed to the hospital , where the child died two days later , the documents said			0
a jury convicted @entity17 of capital murder and sentenced him to death			0
an appeals court reversed the death sentence but affirmed the conviction in 2012 , the court papers said			1
@entity120 , the district attorney , said the @entity121 rejected all but one of the @entity17 legal team 's claims of 45 points of errors in the conviction			0
that one point of error was the testimony by @entity132 , a prosecution expert on the death penalty			0
opinion : execution , a 19th - century relic we still ca n't get right ' ineffective ' defense attorneys @entity141 , a former police officer , was condemned by @entity3 ' highest criminal court in 2012 for giving false testimony , the @entity140 reported			2
" in october 2008 ... mr. @entity141 testified that after 10 years of serving life without parole for @entity148 , an inmate could gain a less restrictive classification from the @entity3 @entity150 , " @entity120 said in a statement			0
" in september 2005 , @entity3 @entity151 changed its regulations and no longer allowed for a less restrictive classification for inmates serving life without the possibility of parole in @entity148 cases			0
based on that testimony , and based on that alone , the @entity121 overturned the punishment of @entity8 , " @entity120 said			2
in 2013 , judge @entity163 granted @entity17 a new trial " on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel because of the actions and conduct by both @entity169 and @entity170 , " the court papers said			1
@entity171 was deceased at the time of the ruling , and @entity170 was n't immediately available for comment wednesday			0
death penalty facts that may surprise you prosecutor 's response the @entity16 continued to criticize prosecutors wednesday , saying that " after @entity17 's conviction was overturned , and in the face of overwhelming evidence of his innocence , the @entity181 refused to dismiss the murder charge against him unless he took a plea , " the @entity16 said			1
@entity17 pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of injury to a child " rather than face a new trial that could be plagued by the same injustices that sent him to death row , " the @entity16 said			1
but in his statement wednesday , @entity120 pointed out that " at no point did any court , trial or appellate , or any jury make any finding that mr. @entity8 was actually innocent of murdering @entity100			1
" in fact , every time the issue was brought up , it was found to be without merit			0
it was and continues to be the position of the @entity59 district attorney 's office that @entity8 did contribute to the death of @entity100 , and he was and is being punished for that crime , " @entity120 said			2
