-- radiation levels in fish caught near the @entity6 nuclear power plant remain high long after the 2011 meltdowns there , suggesting contamination from the site might still be seeping into @entity12 waters , a @entity2 researcher reported thursday			1
the " vast majority " of fish caught off @entity13 show no sign of radioactive contamination at levels dangerous to humans , even at the tighter limits @entity13 imposed after the @entity6 accident , @entity20 , a marine radiochemist at the @entity22 in @entity23 , wrote in this week 's edition of the journal @entity26			1
but close to the plant , an ongoing high level of the reactor byproducts cesium - 134 and cesium - 137 " implies that cesium is still being released to the food chain , " he wrote			1
nuclear plant operator admits downplaying risk the sources are likely to be from radioactive particles released by the plant that settled into sediment on the sea floor or from groundwater seeping into the ocean from the plant , as operators continue to pour tons of water a day into the reactors to keep them cool			0
researchers ca n't say definitely which is the more likely source , " but we know both are happening , " @entity20 told @entity0			1
" we ca n't say whether it 's today 's cooling water or from last april , but we continue to see cesium in the ocean , directly at the plant , is elevated , " he said			2
but he added that those levels are " not dangerously high -- i do n't think we need to be alarmist about this			0
" the plant is no longer venting radioactive steam into the atmosphere , as it was at the height of the disaster			0
and the plant 's operator , the @entity62 , has set up a system to absorb cesium from reactor coolant water			2
but not all that water is being recovered , @entity20 said			2
mutant butterflies a result of nuclear disaster @entity20 was one of the organizers of an international research expedition three months after the disaster			2
he studied @entity13 government reports of cesium contamination in about 8,500 fish caught at different locations off northeastern @entity13 for his latest findings			1
the tsunami that hit @entity6 after @entity13 's historic march 2011 earthquake knocked out power and coolant systems at the plant , resulting in meltdowns in three reactors			1
the result was the worst nuclear accident since @entity88 , as the crippled reactors spewed enormous amounts of radioactive particles into the environment			0
most of the fallout from the plant was blown out to sea , where it was diluted in the vast @entity12			0
but while no deaths have been directly attributed to the accident , tens of thousands of people remain displaced from contaminated towns surrounding the plant			0
radiation readings in the contaminated fish varied widely , with bottom - dwellers typically showing the highest results , @entity20 said			1
that suggests that contamination has settled over the seabed , where it will persist for decades -- cesium - 137 takes 30 years to lose half its radioactivity , while cesium - 134 has a radioactive half - life of only two years			2
record radiation found in fish near @entity6 plant @entity118 accumulates in the muscle tissues of fish , which eventually process and excrete most of it			0
since april , @entity13 authorities have banned fish that show levels of both cesium isotopes higher than 100 becquerels per kilogram of wet weight			1
most fish caught beyond the shores of @entity129 , where the plant is located , test well below that limit			0
but levels between 1,000 and 10,000 bq / kg have been found in fish caught off @entity6			0
in one surprising result , two greenling -- a typically bottom - dwelling , near - shore fish -- tested above 25,000 bq / kg in august , @entity20 found			2
@entity20 credited @entity13 's government for trying to protect the health of its people , noting , " they certainly are n't hiding these numbers			1
" but he added , " there 's a lot of uncertainty in the @entity13 public what to believe , who 's telling the truth			0
and with radiation , there 's a lot of alarmism and fear that goes with it			0
" @entity13 nuclear plant operator admits playing down risk the @entity62 , the operator of the @entity6 plant , said it is monitoring radiation contamination in fish and has not seen any meaningful change , but has implemented a series of preventative measures as a precaution .			1

@entity2 *scientist* : cesium levels in fish point to ongoing source of contamination
the source could be from the seabed or from ongoing leaks from the *damaged* plant
@entity20 studied thousands of @entity13 catch reports for his study
