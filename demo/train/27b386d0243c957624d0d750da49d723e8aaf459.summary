-- when an overwhelmed @entity2 tweeted : " i need an assistant ! " she considered it more of a joke than a serious request , because she could n't pay a salary			1
" i ca n't even offer room & board , only a camp trailer named the @entity11 & an unlimited supply of milk ! " she tweeted last month			2
@entity2 is not a celebrity or executive requiring a personal assistant , but a published writer and photographer who lives in a log cabin on 40 acres in the rolling hills near @entity21 , @entity22			1
her homestead includes a dog , tomcat , dairy cow , baby calf , young bull she 's training to work like an ox , two horses and , of course , @entity33 the coyote			2
she feels overwhelmed with the daily care of all the animals			0
but she 'd also like to share her home with visiting assistants because " it 's becoming so rare in @entity40 to have the time and space and the openness of the rural landscape that is shrinking			0
" the only " luxury " she will be able to provide a starving artist is the time " to work on whatever they want art-wise " in their off time , without having the stress of coming up with money for rent or utilities			2
her ad was only posted for a day or two but drew around 100 responses -- with one person offering to pay her for the opportunity to be her assistant			2
she directed them to an application			0
she shared a few of the forms with her boyfriend , @entity63 , a trapper with the @entity64 , who found all the applicants interesting and told her if he had to choose , he 'd have to move into a tent so they could all move into his house			0
the application also came with an unusual warning to all would - be helpers that there would be no petting , no face - to - face time and no " hanging out " with @entity33			0
the wild - born @entity33 earns his keep by allowing @entity2 to take photos of his everyday activities and write about him in her book as well as on her blog -- both titled the @entity80			1
she 's raised him since he was 10 days old , after his parents were shot for attacking sheep			0
although he walks on a leash , co-exists with @entity84 the cat , plays with @entity86 the dog and often visits inside @entity2 's house , @entity33 does not like strangers			1
so for everyone 's safety , her new helper will not be visiting inside the electric fence that surrounds his territory			2
but that 's ok with self - taught artist @entity96 of @entity97 , who plans to move into the trailer and spend part of her days helping @entity2 with household tasks such as cleaning milk pails and maintaining her web site , and the rest of her time on her art. @entity96 , 23 , expects the experience will have a " monumental " effect on her drawing , painting and screen printing			1
she describes her current drawings as " very primordial and ancient feeling , " while her new boss calls them fantastic			0
@entity96 has already started blogging about her new life and plans to set off later this month			1
she sought out the position because @entity2 's " energy and everything about her just completely resonates and it 's something i connect with			1
" @entity2 was a little concerned about sharing her space with a stranger , but said she felt " a kindredness " with the young woman , who has been working as an apprentice tattoo artist in @entity124 , @entity97			1
@entity96 also performs " live art , " which she describes as taking place in a theater during a concert or play with her perched near the edge of the stage , painting on a large scale that has her " throwing paint and finger painting -- getting crazy with it			1
" the work - exchange program will give @entity2 more time to " concentrate on her next artistic endeavor			1
" she has a few ideas percolating and hopes to decide on one " the day after my new help arrives			0
" @entity96 , a tattooed former military brat , feels her arrival wo n't go unnoticed , with her @entity141 covered in stickers she describes as bizarre and with an interior sporting a bobble - head @entity143 and feathers			1
@entity2 landed in @entity22 after her own unusual journey , a solo , cross-country trip from @entity149 to @entity150 on a motor scooter			1
after reaching her destination , she returned to the shadow of the @entity155 mountains to write about the trip on her @entity158 blog			0
while she fell in love with @entity22 instantly , the author says it still felt like another planet at first and it was a year and a half before she " fully got into the rhythm of this life			1
" because @entity96 's father was in the @entity168 , she says she 's used to having to uproot and adapt to new places			2
she also describes herself as being outdoorsy , pretty adventurous and a nature person who loves to challenge herself			0
the two women will have to work out their schedules and computer differences : the @entity22 resident only knows @entity175 , while the visitor has built her own pc			2
@entity2 plans to teach @entity178 how to market her art on the @entity180 and is willing to teach her how to mend real fences and care for the animals			2
the older woman picked up her skills watching and helping her neighbors			0
" i 'm a pretty gung ho , hardworking person , so i 'll probably get my hands on everything , " says the painter , who expects a full , disciplined life in the country with fewer distractions than the city			0
but there is one service @entity96 says she probably wo n't be able to provide to @entity2 's satisfaction : cooking			1
she says her mother hated cooking so she never learned			0
she has been taking lessons from a vegan friend who does n't use any animal products			0
cooking takes a lot more planning on the homestead because the nearest grocery store is about an hour away .			0
