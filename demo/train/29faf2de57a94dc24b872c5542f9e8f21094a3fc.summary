top members of the computer hacker group " @entity3 " and its offshoots were arrested and charged tuesday after a wide - ranging investigation used the help of a group leader who was working as a secret government informant			1
five of the suspects , considered by investigators among the " most sophisticated hackers in the world , " were arrested in the @entity13 and @entity14 and charged in a @entity16 federal court over their alleged role in high - profile cyberattacks against government agencies and large companies , according to an indictment			1
a sixth man , @entity22 , a notorious hacker known as " @entity22 , " pleaded guilty in august to computer hacking and other crimes			1
as part of his plea deal , @entity22 cooperated with government investigators and helped build a case against the five other defendants , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation			0
@entity33 , 23 ; @entity34 , 29 ; @entity35 , 25 ; and @entity36 , 19 , have been charged with conspiracy regarding attacks against @entity39 , @entity40 and the @entity41 , or @entity41			2
@entity36 is also accused of hacking into the personal e-mail account of an @entity44 national police officer and eavesdropping on a conference call between @entity44 police , the @entity48 and other law enforcement agencies about ongoing investigations into @entity3 and other hacker groups			1
the suspect allegedly recorded the call and disseminated the recording to other hackers			2
@entity56 , 27 , was charged with a december cyberattack against a @entity59 firm called @entity60 , which authorities say might have affected about 860,000 people			2
@entity36 and @entity35 are from @entity44 , and @entity56 is from @entity64 , the indictment said			0
@entity33 and @entity34 are from @entity65			0
@entity22 , 28 , in august pleaded guilty to 12 counts of computer hacking and other crimes			1
known as a " rooter , " the @entity70 resident identified vulnerabilities in a variety of computer systems and then passed along that information to other hackers			2
@entity22 and others have claimed responsibility for cyberstrikes between december 2010 and june 2011 that included denial of service attacks against the websites of @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			1
a denial of service ( @entity87 ) attack typically involves the use of a large number of computers to bombard websites with phony requests for information , causing the site to temporarily shut down			0
dubbed " @entity104 , " authorities say the credit card and @entity84 attacks were prompted by the firms ' refusals to process donations to @entity101 , an organization that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information			0
the group 's website has released thousands of classified diplomatic cables as well as confidential -- and , at times , controversial -- messages about the wars in @entity110 and @entity111			0
authorities say @entity22 also hacked or launched dos attacks against computer systems operated by the governments of @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			2
beginning in december 2010 , the indictment said , @entity22 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 conspired as a splinter hacker group called @entity122 and penetrated the website of @entity124 , an @entity44 political party , as well as the computer systems of a security firm called @entity128 and its affiliates			1
the group allegedly stole confidential data from about 80,000 user accounts associated with the firm			0
then in 2011 , apparently feeling the heat from investigators , the group formed another offshoot organization called @entity138 , or @entity138 , the indictment said			2
@entity138 then ratcheted up " a campaign of malicious cyberassaults on the websites and computer systems of various business and governmental entities in the @entity13 and throughout the world			1
" @entity146 , who identifies as an @entity3 spokesman , told @entity148 that @entity22 recently took over leadership of @entity138			1
he said the hacker also contacted him several months ago by instant message , and he described those communications as " weird			0
" " there have always been rumors from a couple of people ( within @entity3 ) something weird was going on with @entity138 when ( @entity22 ) started , " said @entity146 , whose @entity154 apartment was visited by @entity48 agents early tuesday morning			1
@entity146 said that he and others in @entity3 were upset with @entity138 and @entity22 because @entity22 had bragged about stealing credit card information			1
still , he says , tuesday 's indictments wo n't disrupt the organization 's actions over the long - term			0
" there are more than enough people around , " he said			0
" major operations going forward wo n't be interrupted			0
authorities have said that leader within the organization was secretly working with government officials and aided their investigation			0
@entity3 is considered a loosely tied group of hackers , that have spawned affiliate bodies , and in recent years have focused their efforts on coordinating cyberattacks for political reasons or as retribution for the activities of governments and large corporations .			1
