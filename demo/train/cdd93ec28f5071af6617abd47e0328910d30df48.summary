@entity1 , @entity0 -- have at least $ 68,000 to spare ? if so , you may be in the running to join an exclusive group of individuals who have had their complete genome sequenced			1
bidding for an @entity9 auction for whole genome sequencing service begins at $ 68,000			1
starting friday , the non-profit @entity11 and private firm @entity12 are auctioning a whole genome sequence on @entity9			1
the highest bidder will walk away with a full readout of their gene map , along with a complete interpretation of their genetic details			0
hopes that genome sequencing will help usher in a new era of individualized health care have been rising ever since the first human genome sequence was completed in 2003			1
the genome is a map of all the dna in the human body			2
it serves as a blueprint for physical and behavioral traits as well as susceptibility to diseases			0
if genetic sequencing can be made more widely accessible , it has the potential to have a profound impact on health care , said @entity40 , a professor of genetics at @entity42 who worked on the @entity43			1
the auction will run for 10 days and bidding begins at a cool $ 68,000			1
proceeds will go to the @entity11 , an educational institute that provides cash incentives to encourage innovation			0
the launch of the auction on friday coincides with @entity51 , which marks the day when the double helix structure of @entity28 was discovered as well as the completion of the first human genome sequence			1
there are about 1,600 known genes that influence an individual 's health and the health of their offspring , according to @entity62 , who is also a co-founder of @entity12			2
besides identifying risk of diseases , sequencing can also determine an individual 's potential reaction to certain drugs and pick out those that may be ineffective or even toxic			2
he believes personal genomes eventually will be integrated into preventive care one day			1
but genomics today is like the personal computers in the 1970s			1
would you pay to have your genome sequenced ? how much ? send us an @entity79 with your views " this is a time of rapid transition where tools are being developed and people are deciding whether they want to be early adopters or not , " he told @entity2			2
for now , complete human genome sequencing is still out of reach for most consumers			1
@entity90 , @entity89 - based @entity12 charges $ 99,500			2
the company has attracted at least 20 customers since it was started in 2007			0
the winning bidder will be invited to attend a roundtable discussion where @entity12 's scientists will review the winner 's analysis			0
the winner also gets a private dinner with @entity62			0
to be sure , the cost of technology has fallen rapidly from the $ 3 billion it cost to sequence the first human genome in 2003			1
but it 's still cost prohibitive to incorporate complete sequences into medical research and care			1
genomics plays a critical role in the move towards personalized medicine , according to @entity112 , executive director of the life sciences prize group at @entity11			2
but the cost of technology is limiting wide - range research studies which could help shed more light on how to interpret genetic information			0
" if we can drive this technology to be at a price point where you can do more studies and apply it more broadly , the more the data will have an impact on individuals , " she told @entity2			0
in the aim of speeding up the sequencing process and lowering costs , @entity11 is offering $ 10 million to the first team to successfully sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days for $ 10,000 per genome or less			1
however , predicting disease is a tricky business , and there is still much to be understood , researchers say			0
recent studies suggest that many diseases are the result of variations of several , rather than just a single , gene			0
much more research needs to be done before genetic testing can be applied to personalize medicine , according to @entity146 , who heads the @entity147 at @entity148			0
" right now we need to understand how the genome of patients is changed in disease , " he said			0
" we do n't understand how genomes of people with epilepsy or autism or schizophrenia differ			0
we are still at the research phase			0

bidding for auction of whole genome sequencing begins at $ 68,000
launch of auction on friday coincides with @entity51
personal genomics may *transform* health care , but costs still prohibitive
much more needs to be done to unravel *mystery* of genome , *experts* say
