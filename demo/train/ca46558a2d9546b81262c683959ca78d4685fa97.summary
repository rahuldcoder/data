-- if you saw @entity2 in " @entity3 " or " @entity4 " this summer , you will be surprised at how different he looks in " @entity5 , " a hit - man thriller with a time travel conceit			1
@entity2 looks older and more mature somehow : with a high forehead , a more pronounced nose and a way of pursing his lips in a faintly ironic scowl			2
the reasons for his makeover become apparent when his character , @entity15 , comes face to face with his older self , played by @entity17 : higher forehead , same nose , same scowl			1
it 's enough to put even the sharpest hit man ( or " looper " ) off his aim			2
and @entity15 gets away , which is a problem , because if @entity26 does n't rectify the situation and fulfill his contract , he wo n't qualify for the 30 - year retirement plan that 's allowed @entity15 such a long and fruitful life			0
they 'll both be cut off in their prime			0
the first film in four years from " @entity35 " and " @entity36 " writer - director @entity37 , " @entity5 " is a smart suspense movie			2
it 's essentially a low - tech variation on themes from " @entity41 " but ingenious enough to feel fresh , intriguing and even bewildering at times			0
most flicks are so predictable , you could set your watch by them ... if you still had a watch ( @entity15 has a silver pocket watch , but he 's a slave to retro fashion )			0
@entity37 adopts an arrestingly bold and unusual structure , introducing two major characters an hour in and employing telekinesis when it seems the time travel thing is getting old			1
but his readiness to make us stretch should not blind us to the fact that " @entity5 " is full of holes : time holes , holes for corpse disposal , and enough plot holes to fill a leaky bucket			2
it is set , confusingly , 30 years from now , in a low - budget future that looks like a more broken down version of our present ( give or take a few flying motor vehicles )			0
time travel has not been invented , but in another 30 years , it will be -- that is , in 2070 -- and the mob has taken to sending their marked men back in time to be dispatched by loopers and disposed of in @entity15 's less - regimented present			1
confused ? you will be			0
it does n't even matter that nobody thought to make @entity2 's earlobes resemble @entity17 ' ( if you 've seen " @entity79 , " you 'll know that 's a dead giveaway )			1
it 's fun being flummoxed , and @entity37 has a knack for pulling off short , snappy scenes that keep the drama percolating ( the excellent supporting cast , including @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , also helps )			1
yes , it 's a b movie sci - fi thriller , but not many prestige pictures have this much going on underneath the surface .			0
