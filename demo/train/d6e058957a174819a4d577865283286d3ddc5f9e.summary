-- when several health setbacks sapped my 77 - year - old dad 's zest for life , i had to do something			1
my friend @entity7 came to my rescue when she showed off her @entity9 , a small wearable digital device that logs every step you make and nudges you to keep moving			2
it also tracks your calories to help watch how much you eat			2
my dad , @entity15 , loves gadgets , so i thought a @entity9 could get him off the couch			1
six months later , he 's still moving			1
he 's lost weight and feels more energized , but what happens when the novelty wears off ? can digital monitors really help people like my dad kick unhealthy habits blamed for growing global obesity rates ? a health study published in january by a @entity28 - based think tank says over-eating and sedentary lifestyles are causing an " explosion " of obesity around the world			1
the @entity35 's " @entity36 " study found that in 2008 , one in three adults was overweight or obese , a 23 % rise from 1980			1
in the same time , obesity had spread faster in the developing world than richer countries			2
people are gaining weight because they 're eating more meat , sugar and fat -- and in bigger portions			1
and doctors say obesity puts us more at risk of some of the leading causes of preventable death -- like heart disease , stroke , type - 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer			1
doctors say we need to eat less and move more to maintain a healthy weight			2
but getting us moving has been an uphill battle			2
few people are able to stick with a fitness routine for long			1
@entity65 in the @entity66 says 50 % of their members eventually return to their sedentary lifestyle			2
you 've probably noticed how gyms get crowded by the " @entity72 " people in january , only to get back to normal by spring			2
many people just ca n't stay motivated for long			2
so does technology stand a better chance ? digital activity monitors seem to offer a technological solution to solving both problems , eating too much and moving too little			2
they all work in a similar way , using a sensor to track movement , heart rate and body temperature			1
they nudge you to move when you sit too long and give you feedback on whether you 're meeting your goal			2
you can wear them as a bracelet or pin them to your belt or clothing			0
they can connect to websites where you can check your daily activity , log your calories and compete with other users			0
some of the monitors can tell you how well you 've slept , by tracking your moves at night			0
among the most popular brands are @entity9 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
they cost between $ 60 and $ 200 , depending on the features			0
according to @entity106 , a consumer market research group which tracks sales , @entity9 had 67 % share of the @entity66 retail market , @entity103 accounted for 19 % and @entity104 , 10 %			0
fitbits are now sold in 30,000 stores across 28 countries around the world			0
and @entity103 has announced plans to expand in @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and the @entity119			0
last year @entity9 made inroads at @entity0			1
several staff gave it a try , including my colleague @entity124			0
" @entity128 did i know , that would be the one thing , after countless diets and resolutions and short - lived exercise programs , that finally works , " she said			1
so i surprised my dad with a @entity9 when i went to see him in my native @entity134			1
associate professor @entity135 , who studies wearable digital devices at @entity138 's @entity137 , says monitors have taken off because they are easy to use and actively track progress towards goals			1
but is this another passing fitness fad ? health economist @entity143 believes they have lasting power because they meet the needs of our modern lives			1
she says do - it - yourself monitoring will become more important in healthcare , both as a way for people to manage their health and get feedback from their doctors			1
@entity124 is still using her @entity9 more than a year later , while dad has been wearing his for six months			1
@entity159 says : " i move two to three times more than before and i 'm more energized and feel stronger			0
" i walk three to five miles a day and want to do even more			0
" but @entity124 is our newsroom @entity9 star			0
she lost 30 pounds ( 13kg ) in eight months			0
she went from being overweight to being in the normal range and has kept the weight off since last november			0
but they have their struggles			0
dad is still used to putting his feet up			1
@entity124 's biggest challenge is life 's special occasions , " the perfect excuse to slack off			1
" she says : " i have to work hard to maintain my no - excuses policy while still cutting myself some slack every once in a while			1
it 's a tough balance to strike			1
" also , vacations -- when i take a week off from work , the routine is broken			1
i really have to make sure i 'm wearing the @entity9 and logging calories every day or i 'll fall off the wagon			0
" for now @entity124 and dad are determined to stick with their @entity181			1
but even if they lose interest , they all say they 've gained one lasting benefit , more awareness of how much to move and eat to stay healthy			1
@entity143 says awareness helps us adopt good habits			0
" over time , your daily life flow changes and these movements become more automatic			0
" these actions can be mutually - reinforcing , in particular the more you move , the more you burn calories , so that informs the food choices you make on a daily basis			1
" the @entity201 research firm found that 50 % of consumers stopped using their digital tracking devices within six months			0
but device use could go up as more employers provide them to cut healthcare costs			0
and scientists are testing ways to tweak digital activity trackers to help people stay with them longer			0
the biggest benefit to me is how it helped my dad regain his zest for life			2
but i 'm a little apprehensive about getting a monitor			0
i worry about becoming too controlled by a gadget always keeping a wary eye on me			0
besides , my " low - tech " routine has worked well for more than six years now			2
but seeing how much fun people are having with their monitors , it might just be enough to nudge me to join in the fun .			0

do - it - yourself fitness monitoring is a growing trend
but do gadgets that track your exercise programs have lasting benefits ?
