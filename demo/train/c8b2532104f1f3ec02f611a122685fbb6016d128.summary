-- @entity1 and yellow auto rickshaws chug through the crowded streets of @entity4			1
tuk tuks sputter on the roads in @entity7 to tourists ' delight			1
millions in @entity11 and @entity12 rely on these three wheelers -- known variously as rickshaws , tuk tuks or tricycles -- as an affordable mode of transportation			1
but while beloved by many , the vehicles are also blamed for bottleneck congestion and pollution , spewing carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide and particle matters that become trapped inside the lungs			1
" in many places both inside @entity29 and in other @entity31 countries , the three - wheeler is considered a symbol of a less - than - modern - economy , not appreciated by some image - conscious businessmen and government officials , " said @entity33 , chairman of the @entity34 , the trade association for such vehicles			2
as concerns over air pollution and fuel dependence grow , several @entity31 companies are vying to become the @entity44 of motorbikes to bring zero - emission , light electric vehicles to the masses			1
@entity31 cities have the worst air pollution in the world there is major interest in turning electric in @entity29 , and to a lesser extent in @entity56 , @entity7 and @entity57 as well , said @entity33			1
@entity29 drivers hesitant to adopt electric cars the move to electric is also gaining traction with motorcycle manufacturers , said @entity33			2
" @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , and others have had production of gasoline three - wheelers that we expect to see in electric versions , " he says			2
@entity73 company pushes for innovating motorcycles in the effort to revolutionize the industry , a lanky , young engineer turns on a motorcycle at a warehouse set amongst farmland about 70 miles north of @entity82			0
the engine hums to life with a low whooshing sound -- so quiet you have to crane your ear to hear it			0
the white motorbike 's display panel lights up			0
there are no plumes of smoke gushing out of the exhaust or the odor of gasoline			0
@entity97 is a @entity73 start - up specializing in electric motorcycles and tricycles , which it plans to market in @entity12 and @entity31			1
@entity73 motorcycle brands like @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity102 and @entity103 dominate the @entity31 market outside of @entity29 , because customers trust the brands and @entity73 engineering , said @entity108 , ceo of @entity97			0
the motorcycle industry has to evolve and adapt to electric energy , to avoid becoming like @entity112 films , which did n't evolve to digital quickly and was rendered obsolete , he said			2
@entity108 hopes that @entity73 electric vehicles will catch on as their motorcycles and tricycles originally did several decades ago in @entity31			1
his company is trying to market electric versions in @entity56 , @entity119 and @entity57			0
" each country has its own preferences for the eyes and smile , " he said referring to the front of the vehicle where the headlights are located			0
the vehicles carry lithium batteries that take about 10 hours to recharge			0
but would these vehicles work in countries where there are frequent power outages ? @entity108 said charging the vehicles are like charging cell phones and would usually occur overnight , when electricity usage is typically low			0
several communities are already adapting to electric vehicles and that there are examples of " reverse innovation " which is innovation from developing countries that spreads to richer countries , he said			1
in @entity141 , he found garages , propped up by bamboo and tin , transformed into charging stations for electric vehicles			1
" some people charge at these garages , " he said , showing a picture he took in @entity148			0
" they 're already achieving a new kind of business where you rent a parking space and pay to charge			0
" with fuel prices increasing , @entity108 says there is growing willingness to adapt and to find new business opportunities with electric vehicles			1
and unlike electric cars which are hampered by the lack of charging stations , the electric tricycle taxis usually travel less distance than cars , so they 'd be likely to travel closer to their electric source , he says			0
" i believe that air and noise pollution issues , along with the ever increasing price of petrol , will push all of these high density communities to electric two - and three - wheelers , " @entity33 said			2
non-oecd @entity31 countries are expected see as much as a 200 % increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector by 2030 , according to @entity178			0
the @entity119 is one of the first nations to make a concerted push towards electric vehicles , which it plans to roll out first in @entity184 and to the rest of the country			1
it plans to lease 100,000 new electric taxi trikes to drivers to replace its sputtering , gas - powered vehicles by 2016 .			2

auto rickshaws or tuk tuks are cheap mode of transit for people in @entity12
they 're also seen as contributing to congestion and pollution
expert says electric vehicles are becoming more *popular*
