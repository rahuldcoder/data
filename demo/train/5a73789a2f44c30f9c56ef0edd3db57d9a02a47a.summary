in his budget , @entity1 has taken the red pen to social spending items dear to @entity48 in his own base and handed bigger tax invoices to the wealthy and corporations , something @entity37 have resisted			2
his proposed reductions on @entity19 and @entity55 spending have caused consternation among some of @entity1 's supporters , who argue it will leave vulnerable @entity15 without enough support			1

this does not include @entity19 and @entity55 taxes			0
nearly a quarter of income taxes , $ 245.17 , went to a category labeled " @entity83			2
" a slightly smaller sum , $ 223.38 , or 22.45 % , was spent on " health care			1
" ongoing military operations , such as the @entity15 presence in @entity88 , swallow the largest sum of defense spending , laying claim to more than 10 % of taxpayer dollars , the @entity10 said			1
@entity55 and @entity99 , programs for the country 's seniors and poor respectively , take up nearly all of the " heath care " spending category in the income tax breakdown			1
