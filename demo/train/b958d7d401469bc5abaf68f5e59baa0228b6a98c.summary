@entity0 -- i ca n't even remember the last time i thumbed a message on its itty - bitty qwerty keyboard			2
and yet , i stubbornly keep my @entity6 in my bag and on my desk , fully charged			1
as with my @entity10 of yesterday , breaking up with a beloved gadget is hard to do , especially when you have history			2
my @entity6 and i go back over 10 years			1
we met at a telecom conference in @entity0			2
i will never forget the wonder of our first wireless e-mail			2
look , i 'm no softie when it comes to loving and leaving my electronics			2
i 've thrown out old @entity20			0
i 've recycled expired @entity22 handsets			0
i 've even trashed now - antique digital cameras			0
but this is the longest and saddest gadget breakup i 've ever gone through			0
i can no longer accept its limits : a disappointing apps portfolio , clunky interface , and frankly lame camera			1
over the years , we grew apart			0
i started to dabble in social media and mobile photography			0
the tools on offer from other devices were far better in functionality , speed and resolution			1
i wanted my @entity6 to change , and yet it never managed to deliver			1
and suddenly , i felt like it just was n't there for me			0
i have stopped using the beloved device			1
but like the other 50 million @entity6 users still out there , i just ca n't pull the plug			1
read more : @entity6 's dwindling users ponder uncertain future as with others suffering relationship issues in the digital age , i turned to social media for advice			1
drop it in the tub			0
better for both of you , " advised @entity56 blogger @entity55			0
@entity59 tweeted , " if it 's not wounded or sick , no mercy killing			2
put it into a vitrine			0
" after looking up the word " vitrine , " i realized that putting an expired gadget in a glass box is like taxidermy for a deceased pet			0
just ca n't go there			0
but not everyone was as keen to ditch the @entity6			1
my ever - compassionate colleague @entity71 said , " do n't do it ... it will get better ... i promise			0
" on monday , @entity6 announced that it was being taken private -- a headline that raised hopes among loyalists that change is sure to come			1
meanwhile , my pal @entity79 implored me to keep hope alive with the reminder , " the typing is so much easier ! " but the doubt has already settled in , and i 'm already starting to see my @entity6 in the past tense			1
" just for fun , i fire up my circa 2005 @entity85 750 sometimes , " reminisced @entity84			0
that 's one beautiful ode to throwback gadgetry			2
@entity6 , i 'm not quite ready to throw you out			1
opinion : why i 'll never ditch my @entity6			1
