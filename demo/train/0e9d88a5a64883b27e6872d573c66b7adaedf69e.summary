that 's not the way i raised @entity8			1
she was n't raised up like that , " @entity25 said			2
" her three months out there , she never said that anything was wrong			2
she never gave me any inclination she was doing this or thinking about doing this			2

she 's very vulnerable , but she 's a sweet person , " @entity99 told @entity104			1
" she 's very trusting			0
she never thought that somebody would hurt her if she never gave them no reason to hurt her			0
" authorities at one point suggested that maybe @entity109 had decided to leave and start a new life , but @entity111 said he did n't buy it			1
" @entity96 would not leave her son like that , " he said			0
