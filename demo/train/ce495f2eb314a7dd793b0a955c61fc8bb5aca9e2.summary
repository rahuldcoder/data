-- thirteen @entity2 juveniles escaped from the @entity3 on friday night , the same juvenile detention center in @entity5 where 32 escaped earlier this month			1
that 's an average of more than 1Â½ escapes per day			2
by saturday morning , 12 of the 13 most recent escapees had been recaptured and brought to a juvenile court detention in @entity5 to face additional charges , according a @entity11 ( @entity11 ) statement			1
a 16 - year - old " with a record that includes theft , assault and runaway " remains at large			0
two of the 32 teenagers who escaped back on september 1 are still on the lam			1
according to its website , @entity20 is for " delinquent male youth " between the ages of 13 and 19 that have committed at least three felonies			1
among those rounded up from the latest jailbreak , " many , if not all , of them have been involved in the previous two incidents , " the @entity11 statement said			0
wait : previous two ? in may , a group of teens broke out through a window and flipped a gate switch in an unsuccessful attempt to free others , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity37 in @entity5			0
" since the last set of escapes , the department has been rapidly upgrading security , " @entity11 said			0
" aluminum panels that students were able to kick through have been replaced with steel ... a project to reinforce the perimeter fence with concrete at the base is nearly complete			0
" but @entity11 , which operates the @entity20 facility , says its guards " have few methods to control the youth ... they do not have weapons or pepper spray			1
" the only thing they do have , according to the @entity11 website , is a radio to call for help			0
another problem , it would seem , is that the delinquent felons in lockup are not actually allowed to be locked up			0
" because of a decades old court settlement , the youth are not allowed to be locked inside their rooms , " it said in a saturday statement			1
according to an account of the incident provided by @entity11 , friday 's escape occurred after two inmates -- which it refers to as students -- overpowered a guard that was making his rounds			1
" he was assaulted , and the students took his radio and keys			1
the other youth in the dorm came out of their unlocked rooms			2
" the group then made its way to the perimeter gate , where one of them " was able to wriggle through a gap between the fence and the gate " and make it over to the guard house -- which he was able to break into by throwing a rock through the window			2
once inside , he flipped the electric switch that opened the gate , liberating his comrades			0
@entity20 said two of its staff members were injured in the escape , one was treated at the scene , while the other was taken to a @entity5 hospital			2
@entity0 's @entity110 and @entity111 contributed to this report			0
