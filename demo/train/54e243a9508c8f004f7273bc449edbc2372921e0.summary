@entity0 -- a driver of a white prius with a giant , red plastic flag affixed to its side is rolling through the hilly streets of @entity0 , undelivering mail from mailboxes			1
the driver is not a thief			0
he and the car are part of a startup called @entity15 that is attempting to pick up where the embattled @entity16 leaves off -- by digitizing physical mail			1
the driver , dubbed an " unpostman , " visits @entity15 subscribers ' homes three times a week , flipping through a thick ring of keys to open the wide variety of entryways and mailboxes			1
he collects the letters , bills , magazines and advertisements that were deposited there by official postal workers and delivers them to a warehouse			0
there they are opened and photographed , and the resulting digital files are sent electronically to the recipient through the @entity15 website or @entity39 or @entity40 apps			1
the idea is that for $ 4.99 a month , someone can make their pesky physical mail disappear ( assuming they can resist the urge to peek in their mailbox between pickups )			1
using a mobile device or computer , @entity15 customers can organize mail in files or forward them as e-mails , ask to be unsubscribed from junk mail , have unwanted items destroyed or request that important mail , such as a wedding invite or a postcard , be re-delivered to their home			1
the company already has more than 600 customers in @entity65 , @entity66 , and starting tuesday it 's rolling out in its second city , @entity0			1
creating a shadow , reverse postal service may not be the most efficient way to improve the struggling mail system , but @entity15 is unable to intercept clients ' mail any sooner in the process			1
the company has met resistance from the @entity16 , which has refused to collaborate with @entity15 or let its workers pick up mail directly from local post offices			1
" from a startup perspective , we can wait on no one , " said @entity15 co-founder @entity79			1
@entity15 's legal ' gray zone ' even though @entity15 is forging ahead without the blessing of the @entity16 , @entity79 said he has a lot of respect for the federal agency and would welcome any attempts to work together			1
it 's a sentiment that does not yet seem to be mutual			0
" @entity91 is focused on providing an essential service in our mission to serve the @entity95 public and does not view @entity15 as supporting that mission , " the @entity16 said in a statement			1
" we do have concerns regarding the destruction of mail -- even if authorized by the receiver -- and will continue to monitor market activities to ensure protection of our brand and the value and security of the mail			2
" circumventing the @entity16 has been a way to get @entity15 up and running			1
but tampering with mail is a federal offense , and there may be questions about the legality of a third party removing mail from a mailbox , even with permission			0
@entity79 argues that once a piece of mail has been delivered , it becomes just another unregulated piece of paper			0
an @entity15 employee taking mail with permission would be no different from having a neighbor pick it up while you 're out of town , he said			1
" innovation happens in the gray zone of deregulation , " said @entity79			0
" we 're operating in that gray zone			0
" the @entity134 declined to comment on whether the practice is breaking any laws			0
security and privacy also will be a concern for any company handling mail filled with sensitive financial and personal information			0
@entity15 says its employees undergo more thorough background checks than @entity145 employees			2
it uses 512 - bit encryption and device recognition to prevent digitized mail from falling into the hands of someone other than the intended recipient			2
any unwanted physical mail is shredded and recycled			1
can the @entity16 catch up ? the @entity16 has been slow to innovate and adapt to new technology on its own , in part because of constraints such as the 2006 legislation that prohibits it from entering into new businesses			2
the @entity16 also faces serious financial issues			2
in 2012 , the agency had $ 15.9 billion in losses and in early february it announced plans to cease saturday mail delivery this summer in an attempt to save $ 2 billion			2
the @entity16 has also been watching technology steadily eat away at its core business for years			2
the volume of mail handled by the @entity16 dropped from 202.8 billion pieces a year in 2002 to159.9 billion in 2012			2
first class and standard mail are decreasing as bill payments , statements and marketers migrate online			0
one bright spot has been an increase in shipping and packages , the result of the growing popularity of e-commerce			0
" they face a lot of challenges that are not of their own making , " said @entity182 , chief executive of @entity183 , a digital mailbox company that deals directly with large companies			0
he agrees that the @entity16 needs to innovate to stay relevant and thinks they 're starting to try harder to partner with innovative companies			2
@entity15 is n't waiting on the @entity16 's call			1
new , nimble and relatively tiny , the startup can begin experimenting with new ways of handling mail that would take time , and possibly congressional action , for the @entity16 to do			1
" we 've done what they ca n't do without trouble , @entity79 said			0
" we 're able to play by different rules			0
" making money off mail just because the @entity16 is n't making snail mail a profitable business does n't mean it ca n't be done			2
in addition to charging $ 4.99 a month , @entity15 has plans to eventually deliver ads through its apps			1
they would n't be banner ads , but rather would appear just like another item of scanned mail			0
the company would be in a unique position to know what catalogs , fliers and brands a customer likes or marks as junk , and could charge companies that wanted to reach specific demographics			0
the companies currently filling up mailboxes with fliers have already been experimenting with online alternatives			0
if @entity15 attracts enough customers and its ads are effective , it could become an alternative to sending ads through the @entity16			1
" as time changes the marketers evolve , " said @entity234 , a vice president at the @entity235			0
" the more precise they can be means less waste , less money spent on advertising , and more response			0
" @entity15 's @entity79 also believes that once his company has saturated an area , it will be in a great position to handle same - day deliveries for e-commerce companies like @entity248			2
eventually @entity15 will also try tiered pricing for work addresses , and extra features such as forwarding individual pieces of mail to other addresses , he said for now it 's focused on polishing its service and logistics			1
the company has big - name backers like venture capitalist @entity259 and is planning on closing a " sizable " second round of funding in april			0
after @entity0 is fully staffed with unpostmen , @entity15 plans to bring its service to @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268			1
@entity79 is n't worrying yet about competitors			0
" no one is crazy enough to do what we 're doing , " he said .			0

@entity15 picks up mail the post office drops off at homes , scans it and e-mails it to recipient
@entity65 - based startup is rolling out in its second city , @entity0 , this week
the service costs $ 4.99 a month and will still deliver selected physical mail
the struggling @entity16 is not working with @entity15
