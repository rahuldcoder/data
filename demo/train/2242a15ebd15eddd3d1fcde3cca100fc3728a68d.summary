-- on wednesday , april 2 , the @entity1 ruled that any cap on the overall amount a person can spend to influence an election is unconstitutional			1
following on the heels of the court 's previous decision in @entity11 , the @entity7 ruling will allow unlimited spending to influence our nation 's political process			0
in the words of justice @entity23 , who wrote the dissent in the @entity7 case , the ruling " eviscerates our nation 's campaign finance laws , leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were intended to resolve			0
" you should n't need money or connections to get a fair shake in our justice system			0
that 's the very essence of our @entity34 creed			1
and yet we know that even with previous restrictions , money had a corrupting influence on our democracy			1
a federal election survey found that 82 % of @entity34 were worried about special interests buying elections			1
three in five @entity34 thought @entity42 was already more likely to vote in ways that please their financial supporters , while only one in five @entity34 thought @entity42 votes in the best interest of constituents			1
several studies find money gives you access to members of @entity42 and their staff : contributors have disproportionately better access			1
and these studies were conducted before the @entity7 decision , when the total donations to candidates , parties or pacs within an election cycle were still limited at a whopping $ 123,000			2
this decision benefits those who have that kind of money , not the everyday campaign contributor			2
the court upheld the law that puts a $ 5,200 cap on conventional individual contributions to a single candidate			0
but without the $ 123,000 overall limit , imagine how much worse it will be when a single wealthy donor can contribute $ 3.5 million to a political party and its candidates			0
what we have politely called " influence " up until now will become nothing short of bribery			0
it 's hard enough to get the people 's will through @entity42 as is			1
as is , 90 % of @entity34 want stronger gun safety laws and yet gun - industry political contributions hobble legislative momentum			2
and 72 % of voters want to raise the minimum wage -- including a majority of @entity91 -- but campaign spending and lobbying by the low - wage fast food and retail industry is stymieing progress in @entity42 there as well			1
more than half of @entity34 want the federal government to limit power plant emissions and take other steps to curb climate change , moves opposed by the wealthy â € ” and politically generous â € ” oil and gas industry			2
on issue after issue after issue , the will of the @entity34 people is already up against the often - insurmountable obstacles created by well - heeled corporations armed with campaign contributions			1
and now it 's just going to get worse			0
an analysis by the organization @entity116 found that the @entity7 ruling could release more than $ 1 billion in additional election spending from wealthy donors through 2020			0
the community activist group @entity120 has launched a campaign to send @entity123 - like judge robes covered in corporate sponsorship logos to the five @entity1 justices who voted for @entity11 and now the @entity7 decision			2
instead of protecting the marginalized and disenfranchised in @entity34 , the five conservative justices have manipulated our constitution to create new rights and give even more power to our nation 's wealthiest individuals and corporations			0
in 1816 , @entity136 wrote , " i hope that we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations , which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength , and bid defiance to the laws of our country			0
" but rather , thanks in part to the @entity1 ruling in @entity7 , it is now we the people who have been definitively crushed			1
as has our democracy .			0

@entity34 @entity1 rules cap on aggregate amount of election donations is unconstitutional
@entity158 : this benefits people who have the most money to buy the most influence
@entity158 : money gives you disproportionately better access to @entity42 members and staff
@entity158 : *massive* amounts of money and lobbying *overturns* the will of @entity34 on issues
