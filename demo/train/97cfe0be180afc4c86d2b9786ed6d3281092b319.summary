-- @entity1 scored the first hat - trick of the @entity3 as @entity5 's @entity4 took a big step towards qualifying for the second round by crushing @entity9 4 - 1 in @entity10 on thursday			1
in a tournament so far largely lacking attacking flair , the @entity11 showed fine style in following up their 1 - 0 opening @entity16 victory against @entity18 , who later slipped to their second defeat as they went down 2 - 1 to @entity22 in the second match of the day in @entity24			1
@entity4 's winning margin was the second - highest so far at the @entity27 event , behind only @entity29 's 4 - 0 thrashing of @entity30			1
" i have to commend my boys for the great job they have done , the only way @entity9 would have made our lives difficult would have been if we had allowed them to , " @entity5 told @entity31			0
" we were never worried about them and they never upset us			0
" @entity9 , who defeated the @entity40 in their opening match , had battled back to 2 - 1 just before halftime after conceding an unlucky early own - goal , but could not contain the counter-attacking prowess of an @entity4 side spearheaded by the mercurial @entity46			1
but while @entity46 was an ever - present threat , it was @entity50 striker @entity1 who reaped the rewards with three close - range finishes , two in the final 15 minutes			1
the @entity54 made the worst possible start when striker @entity56 inadvertently deflected the ball into his own net off his knee in the 16th minute after teammate @entity60 failed to cut out @entity46 's curling free - kick from wide on the left			0
@entity1 doubled the lead just after half an hour with a header when a cross by @entity66 -- starting in place of the injured @entity68 -- was flicked on by substitute @entity69			0
@entity69 had entered the fray just minutes earlier when central defender @entity71 went off injured			0
@entity9 pulled a goal back on the stroke of halftime as @entity75 pounced on an error by @entity4 defender @entity77 , but @entity78 squandered a golden chance to level in the 58th minute			1
@entity4 and @entity9 win openers @entity1 made it 3 - 1 in the 76th minute after @entity46 's first shot was blocked by the legs of goalkeeper @entity84 and his second rebounded kindly off the base of the post			1
@entity46 and substitute forward @entity88 then combined superbly to set up @entity1 for another header four minutes later			0
@entity4 will be without @entity90 for the final game against @entity22 after the makeshift defender -- who usually plays as a winger -- received his second booking of the tournament			1
victory for @entity22 was their first in the @entity99 finals but owed much to a moment of madness by @entity18 's @entity102			1
the @entity18 led through a free kick from @entity104 after 16 minutes which crept past @entity105 in the @entity107 goal			0
they were generally in charge until @entity102 kicked out needlessly at @entity109 and was shown a red card after 33 minutes			0
@entity22 pressed forward and equalized just before halftime as @entity112 saw his shot deflected into the net off @entity18 's @entity115			2
catch @entity0 's @entity99 twitter.buzz it was the first - ever goal in the @entity99 finals for the @entity40			2
the highlight of the second half was a spell which saw @entity121 superbly denied by @entity123 goalkeeper @entity122 before @entity18 broke upfield with @entity124 forcing @entity105 into a smart save and @entity125 missed a clear chance on the follow - up			0
but soon after pulling off his fine save , @entity122 was deceived by a powerful shot by @entity131 and @entity109 smashed in the rebound from close range for the eventual winner			0
the results mean @entity4 are all but assured of qualification for the last 16 , but still need a point in their final group game against @entity22 to make absolutely sure			2
even @entity18 are not entirely out of it , but would require a big win over @entity9 to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stage .			2

@entity4 on course for second round of @entity99 after defeating @entity9 4 - 1
striker @entity1 scores the first hat - trick of the tournament in @entity27
@entity9 concede early own - goal but pull back to 2 - 1 down at halftime
