everybody on the planet knows that @entity3 created mr. @entity4 , the laconic , imperturbable extra-terrestrial first officer for the @entity5			1
but mr. @entity4 does n't belong to @entity3 , even though he is the grand exalted progenitor of everything that was , is , and forever will be " @entity8			1
" mr. @entity4 belongs to @entity9 , who died friday at age 83			1
and though he does n't take @entity4 with him , he and @entity4 remain inseparable			1
@entity11 , who plays @entity4 in the re-booted feature film incarnation of " @entity8 , " is excellent in the role			1
( @entity9 himself said so			1
) @entity11 must know that however much he brings to the role , he will only be its custodian			0
it is , as @entity4 himself would intone , only logical			1
@entity9 often insisted otherwise , especially as the show went from canceled outcast to global phenomenon			2
he even wrote a book with the title , " @entity28 " ( 1977 ) that was bought by millions of readers who did n't buy the title for a nanosecond			0
by 1995 , he cried " uncle " by publishing a followup autobiography , " @entity31			0
" in the years before and since , he carried his character 's legacy with the grace and class he exhibited in other areas of his life			0
and the life of @entity9 , irrespective of @entity4 , was a rich and varied feast			1
those two " @entity4 " books were n't the only things he 'd published			2
a couple of books of poetry are also credited to him as were a collection of photographs celebrating what he termed " the feminine aspect of @entity49			0
@entity9 had a hand , so to speak , in creating one of @entity4 's most indelible traits : the " live - long - and - prosper " split - finger salute that @entity9 had borrowed from an approximation of the hebrew letter shin , the first letter in the word @entity60 , one of the @entity57 names for @entity49			1
@entity3 did n't think of that			2
and in doing so made an implausible character as much a part of our waking dreams as members of our own family			0
he also directed movies , two of which were part of the " @entity8 " franchise : 1984 's " @entity74 " and 1986 's " @entity75			2
" i got to meet him when the latter film opened			0
it was at a press conference that was part of the promotional junket in @entity81 and @entity9 was very un-spock - like in his jocular , freewheeling enthusiasm for the movie ( which was , in fact , one of the very best , certainly the warmest , of the big - screen " trek " iterations			2
) he could not stop smiling , not even when one of the reporters asked him about a scene in the film that catches @entity4 in an impromptu grin			2
( it vanished once the movie opened in theaters			0
) he looked like a man who knew he was going to soon have a lot more money than he 'd had a week , or a day before -- though anyone with a brain knew he was n't going to squander any of it on trivial things			0
he was nimoy and he was @entity4			0
and they were serious men with serious thoughts			0
still , it was always nice to know @entity9 could smile , even if @entity4 could n't .			1

@entity105 : @entity3 may have created " @entity8 , " but @entity9 and character of @entity4 are inseparable
he says @entity9 had many other artistic endeavors , photography , directing , poetry , but he was , in the end , @entity4
