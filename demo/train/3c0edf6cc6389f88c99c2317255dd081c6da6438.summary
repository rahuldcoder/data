@entity0 -- coalition forces can attain " success " in @entity5 , but @entity3 officials should wait until december 2010 before they can measure the progress of the troop surge , a top @entity3 commander told a @entity11 committee wednesday			1
gen. @entity12 , head of @entity13 , predicted the surge will be met by an increase in violence in spring 2010 and a rise in " security incidents " in the summer			1
turmoil within the @entity5 government over the 18 months of the troop increase is also expected as corruption is rooted out , @entity12 said			2
that , combined with an expected backlash in the spring and summer , @entity12 cautioned , means officials and the public should wait until december 2010 to evaluate the progress of the @entity3 military strategy			1
" while certainly different and in some ways tougher than @entity31 , @entity5 is no more hopeless than @entity31 was when i took command there in february 2007 , " @entity12 told the @entity29			1
" indeed the level of violence and number of violent civilian deaths in @entity31 were vastly higher than we have seen in @entity5 , but achieving progress in @entity5 will be hard and the progress there likely will be slower in developing than progress was achieved in @entity31			1
" @entity12 ' appearance before legislators was the latest by top @entity3 officials on @entity44 this week			0
gen. @entity45 , the commander of @entity3 forces in @entity5 , testified before the @entity11 and @entity48 counterparts of the @entity49 on tuesday , joined by @entity50 , the @entity3 ambassador in @entity51 , who also testified wednesday			1
@entity52 , deputy secretary of state for management and resources also testified wednesday			0
@entity45 told @entity1 on wednesday that @entity3 , @entity5 and @entity53 forces need to cut off the @entity55 insurgency from the @entity5 people by establishing " security zones " that will gradually expand to encompass more and more territory			1
" at the end of the day , the insurgency needs access to the population to be effective , " @entity45 said in an interview with @entity1 's @entity60			1
" they need to be able to coerce the population , to tax the population , to recruit from the population , and to prevent the government from extending its governance into those areas			0
" if @entity55 fighters are forced to keep their distance from the @entity5 population , then " over time , they become irrelevant , and they , in fact , are defeated , " @entity45 said			0
the generals and diplomats were called to testify before the congressional committees about president @entity78 's new plan for the @entity5 war , which involves the deployment of another 30,000 @entity3 troops and a july 2011 date for the beginning of an @entity3 withdrawal			2
part of stabilizing @entity5 and fighting the @entity55 will include supporting legitimate economies among @entity5 , thwarting the chance that some would join the insurgency as a means of making a living , @entity50 testified			0
about 80 percent of the @entity5 people derive their income from agriculture and the @entity3 plans to support agriculture among civilians while keeping farmers from growing heroin in the poppy fields , which can be lucrative for the @entity55 , said @entity50			0
also critical is a partnership with @entity99 , @entity50 , @entity12 and @entity52 agreed			0
chairman of the @entity29 , sen. @entity100 , @entity101 , articulated that fighting the insurgency in @entity5 includes addressing the problem of militants who have sought shelter across the border in @entity99			0
@entity110 leader @entity109 , who has been at large since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , is widely believed to be hiding along the rugged border between @entity5 and @entity99			0
while the withdrawal is set to begin july 2011 , @entity100 said the @entity3 will maintain " engagement " with the region and talks with @entity5 's neighbor , @entity99			2
and @entity5 president @entity118 on tuesday said that the country will need help financing their own military and police forces for the next 10 to 15 years			2
worried about billions of dollars in costs and the longevity of the commitment to @entity5 , sen. @entity126 , @entity127 , asked @entity12 to explain whether 15 years would be necessary and how much money it could cost			2
if @entity5 attained the " aspirational " goal of 400,000 army and police members , it could cost about $ 10 billion a year to support , @entity12 said			1
" there 's no question as president @entity118 was highlighting yesterday that @entity5 will require substantial international funding for years to come in a whole host of different areas , not the least of which is their security forces , " @entity12 said			1
" but i would submit that it is a lot cheaper to maintain a certain number of @entity5 forces than it is to maintain the number of @entity3 and coalition forces required to compensate for their absence			0
