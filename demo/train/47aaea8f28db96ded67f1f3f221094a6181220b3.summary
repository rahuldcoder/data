@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 prosecutor who failed to secure felony convictions against two teens in the beating death of a @entity8 immigrant says he thought his case was " compromised " from the start			1
like many residents in the small , tight - knit eastern @entity15 community of @entity0 , @entity12 district attorney @entity11 knew that an officer investigating the death of @entity18 was in a relationship with the mother of one the teens involved			1
@entity11 also believed the investigation and evidence had n't been handled as it should have been			0
" they did n't interview the perpetrators , the boys			0
in fact , not only did they not interview them , they picked them up , gave them rides , helped them concoct stories , brought them back and told the boys what to say , " @entity11 told @entity2			2
the son of @entity41 lt. @entity40 also played on the same football team as the teens who were involved in the july 2008 street brawl , according to court documents			1
read excerpt from " @entity47 " " it 's clear they were trying to help these boys out , for whatever reason -- they were football players , these police officers were trying to help these boys out and limit their involvement in the death of @entity18			1
" early on , @entity11 says his office reached out to the @entity57 with his concerns			0
their investigation led to a federal indictment alleging that the teens , @entity63 and @entity64 , participated in a scheme to obstruct the investigation with the help of @entity68 , @entity0 police chief @entity69 and police officer @entity70 , who was dating @entity63 's mother			1
@entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 pleaded not guilty in @entity72 in @entity73 on tuesday			0
@entity68 and @entity70 were released ; nestor is being held under a magistrate 's order , his lawyer , @entity74 said			0
" the situation is very tragic in many ways and too many families and i 'm not in any way taking the attention away from what happened to the @entity18 family , " @entity74 said			2
" but i believe that after a full airing of the case and the situation that my client will be fully exonerated			0
" @entity63 and @entity64 are also charged with a federal hate crime for fatally beating @entity18 allegedly because of his race			1
the two are serving prison sentences after a @entity12 jury found them guilty in may of misdemeanor simple assault in @entity18 's death			1
they were acquitted of felony charges of ethnic intimidation , a hate crime according to @entity1 law , and hindering apprehension			1
@entity63 , who was accused of delivering the fatal kick to @entity18 's head while he was on the ground , also was found not guilty of third - degree homicide			1
anticipating the potential jury verdict , @entity11 says his office considered a plea deal			0
" we knew there were problems with the evidence , with what the police did , with the reports that were generated , " he said			2
" we knew our case was compromised and we knew we did n't have the strongest case going forward and that 's why we entertained the plea deal			0
" the plea deal never panned out , but @entity11 says he does not fault the jury for reaching its verdict			0
" with the evidence , the police , what they did , we do n't get to pick our evidence either and you 've got to play the hand you 're dealt , " he said			0
" we respect their verdict and now the federal system has spoken and we 'll see what happens there			0
" the federal indictment alleges that , shortly after the july 12 , 2008 fight , @entity63 went with @entity70 and @entity68 to the scene of the assault and told them about it			1
after talking with them , the indictment says @entity63 went to @entity64 's home and made an agreement with @entity64 and others , including two of the alleged participants " to give a false account of the assault on @entity150 [ @entity151 ] to authorities in official statements , " the indictment says			2
prior to leaving the home , the young men " created a false version of events to be incorporated in official police reports which omitted references to @entity63 kicking @entity18 and to the racial motivation for the assault , " the indictment alleges			1
@entity68 is accused of instructing the teens to dispose of their shoes ; he is also accused of mischaracterizing witness accounts to minimize @entity63 's role			2
@entity70 and @entity69 are accused of creating false and misleading investigative reports , among other allegations , according to the indictment			2
@entity63 's relationship with the officers and rumors of a cover - up have been circulating among the community ever since @entity18 died after two days on life support			1
@entity18 , a 25 - year - old father of two , was living with the mother of his children , a lifelong resident of @entity0			1
he was walking her sister home the night of july 12 when he encountered @entity63 , @entity64 and several other members of the @entity182 football team , who were leaving a local festival			0
prosecutors alleged that the teens baited @entity18 into the initial confrontation after a night of drinking , hurling racial epithets at the undocumented @entity8 immigrant			1
after the fight broke up , witnesses said @entity18 came back at the teens			1
they beat him so severely that , according to medical testimony , brain tissue oozed out of his skull during surgery at a hospital			0
defense lawyers argued that @entity18 's death was a street brawl gone wrong that was not motivated by racial bias			1
they also suggested that @entity18 was responsible for triggering the second confrontation			2
@entity18 's fiancee , @entity203 , said the indictments bring a measure of hope that justice will finally be served			2
" we prayed for this day			0
it was a gift from @entity211 , a @entity212 present from @entity211			0
it was a long - time coming but it was definitely worth the wait			0
" @entity2 's @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 contributed to this report .			0
