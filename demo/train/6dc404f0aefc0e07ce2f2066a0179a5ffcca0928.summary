@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has a spring in his step and a big smile on his face these days			1
the 35 - year - old farmer from @entity8 , a district in @entity0 , northwest @entity1 , says life has never been better			1
it 's all because of what he grows in his fields -- a desert crop called guar			2
" it 's a miracle , " he says			0
guar gum powder , made by crushing seeds of the guar crop , is used in a number of products in the food and cosmetics industries , including ice cream , breads , pastries , lipsticks and even diapers			1
in just one year the price of guar has surged tenfold , from about 30 rupees ( about 50 @entity32 cents ) to around 300 rupees for each kilogram of the precious seed			1
behind the phenomenal price rise is a surge in demand			0
oil and gas companies in the @entity32 have developed a massive appetite for guar gum powder -- a key ingredient in a process called fracking , which is used to extract natural and shale gas from beneath the @entity48 's surface			1
guar gum powder has unique binding , thickening and emulsifying qualities which make it ideal for fracking , explains @entity52 , the founder and managing director of @entity54 , an @entity1 company that specializes in producing the product			1
so far , oil companies have not been able to find a suitable substitute , he says			1
since 90 % of the world 's guar is grown in the desert belt of northwest @entity1 , local farmers in this poor area are enjoying the benefit of the guar rush			1
@entity3 says he had debts of almost $ 12,000			1
" i thought i 'd never be able to pay it off , " he says			2
" there is a saying that in a house where there 's no food , there are fights			0
we used to fight all the time			0
" but thanks to the high price of guar these days , @entity3 has been able to pay off his debt			1
he 's building a house for his family , has bought mobile phones , an air cooler and a satellite dish			0
he can afford to send his children to school			0
" we are all happy now , " he adds			0
@entity52 , meanwhile , is confident the guar rush will grow			2
he says shale gas reserves have been identified in 32 countries and 48 basins around the world , including @entity1			2
only the @entity32 and @entity92 , and very recently @entity93 , have attempted to extract it			0
@entity95 is expected to start fracking by the end of the year			2
as demand grows , @entity52 predicts the value of the guar industry will jump , suggesting it could go from a $ 2 billion business today , to $ 200 billion by 2020			2
so he 's encouraging farmers like @entity3 to keep growing it			1
in may this year , @entity104 gave 15 kilograms of guar seeds to 200,000 farmers and guaranteed them returns			1
" everyone in the village is now growing guar , " @entity3 's wife , @entity108 , says			1
" no one talks of anything else			0
it 's changed the village			0
if you came here two years ago , you would n't see joy on anyone 's face			0
" her neighbors ' house is bursting with joy			0
musicians beat traditional drums to welcome guests as the community gets together to celebrate a marriage			0
the bridegroom -- also a guar farmer -- says he would never have been able to afford this pomp if it was n't for guar			0
locals call the little green bean " black gold " and in @entity8 , it 's easy to understand why .			2
