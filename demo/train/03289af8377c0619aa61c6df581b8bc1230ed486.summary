@entity0 -- as @entity4 continues to dissolve into chaos , @entity3 lawmakers strongly urged that the @entity6 act swiftly on both the diplomatic and militaristic front , warning that the growing instability directly threatens the safety of @entity6			1
the sunday political talk shows focused on the crisis in @entity4			0
military option republicans dominated the political talk shows sunday regarding @entity4 , pushing for immediate involvement in the country that is in turmoil and under attack by an extremist group known as the @entity21 - linked @entity20 in @entity4 and @entity22 , or @entity23			1
fresh off a victory in his @entity3 primary , @entity25 sen. @entity24 emphatically insisted on @entity1 's " @entity28 " that the @entity6 needs to conduct military air strikes in @entity4 to prevent @entity23 fighters from advancing into and taking over @entity4 's capital , @entity32			1
the chairman of the @entity34 , @entity33 , agreed , telling @entity1 that " a little bit of @entity6 air support can be very , very impactful			0
" and @entity38 sen. @entity37 of @entity39 indicated he 'd get behind a military option in @entity4			1
" i 'm open to ... air strikes , technical support , drones , whatever it takes , but i want to make sure our intel is accurate before we start doing this , and i 'm hopeful that they 're getting accurate intel on this , " @entity37 said on @entity42 's " @entity41			0
" president @entity52 on friday did not exclude @entity6 military options -- except for on - the - ground combat troops -- but is reviewing a range of options , including air strikes			1
meanwhile @entity23 gained control of @entity60 last week , @entity4 's second largest city , as well as much of northern @entity4 , and @entity23 fighters worked their way toward @entity32			2
republicans on sunday said the president needs to be decisive and act immediately , " not two weeks down the road , " said rep. @entity65 , @entity66 chairman , on @entity68 's " @entity67			0
" @entity33 said one question needs to be answered : " @entity70 holding land the size of @entity73 a problem for the @entity6 ? " @entity24 said the extremist group 's growing real estate will result in consequences of " monumental proportions " if the @entity6 does n't help stop @entity23			1
one of those consequences would be " the next 9/11 , " @entity24 said			2
@entity65 also warned that @entity23 is " the greatest threat " to @entity6 national security , in part , because @entity4 and @entity22 are a training ground for violent extremists , including @entity6 and @entity84 @entity83 who can freely travel to the @entity39			1
while @entity24 spoke with utter conviction of what the @entity6 response should be , @entity65 was more measured , saying the @entity6 " has to be very careful " about using the military in this situation			1
that 's a sentiment echoed by @entity3 sen. @entity93 on friday who said air strikes are " not easy			0
" the only lawmaker on the political talk shows sunday strongly opposed to a military option in @entity4 was @entity100 veteran @entity99 of @entity101			1
she is opposed to @entity6 involvement			0
" we have to ... focus our great military on those direct and imminent threats rather than getting distracted by involving ourselves in another civil war that 's occurring in another country between religious factions that have been warring for generations , " @entity99 , a @entity103 , said on @entity1 's " @entity28			1
" rep. @entity110 , @entity111 , also an @entity4 war veteran , sharply disagreed			2
" if the establishment of a caliphate by an organization that makes @entity21 look like a bunch of kitty cats is not in @entity6 national interest to stop it , i do n't know what is , " he said on " @entity28			0
" diplomacy the lawmakers also called for a diplomatic component of the @entity6 response , but they disagreed on which countries should be diplomatic partners and how to go about it			2
@entity24 offered an unexpected solution : working with @entity129 -- an @entity6 foe over @entity129 's nuclear program and its back - channel role in numerous conflicts			1
@entity24 said it would be a " mistake " not to engage with the majority - @entity136 country			2
" we need to coordinate with the @entity129 , " @entity24 said			2
" the @entity129 can provide some assets to make sure @entity32 does n't fall			0
" but @entity65 said the @entity6 needs to be more leery of @entity129 and aware that it is seeing @entity4 's instability as an opportunity to grab a hold of power			1
@entity33 said on " @entity143 " that he " would n't fall in that trap " of engaging @entity129			0
but @entity24 said the possibility that @entity129 can sweep in and take power in @entity4 is precisely why the @entity6 should engage			1
" do n't let the @entity129 save @entity32			0
let us save @entity32 so there will be a chance at a second government , " @entity24 said			0
@entity33 said the @entity6 should turn to the @entity151 to get involved and that it would be " a failure of @entity6 leadership " if it ca n't elicit @entity151 involvement			0
but shortly after @entity33 made that statement , the 22 - country organization released a statement that while its members denounced the violence they would not get involved in a sovereign country 's affairs			0
@entity163 and @entity52 all of the lawmakers had little good to say about @entity4 prime minister @entity163 or @entity52			0
@entity24 said @entity163 should resign because he 's " incapable of bringing the @entity166 back into the fold			0
" @entity65 said , " @entity163 has failed , as well as our president without the @entity170			0
" the @entity170 was never reached between the @entity6 and @entity4 to keep residual troops in the country			1
@entity24 said on @entity1 that it was " absolutely a lie " that @entity163 refused to allow @entity6 troops to stay behind			2
" the @entity52 administration wanted to say : ' i ended the war in @entity4 , ' " @entity24 said , adding that he blames @entity52 " mightily for a hands - off policy			1

@entity24 : consequences of " monumental proportions " if @entity23 is not stopped
a @entity103 , rep. @entity99 , speaks against a @entity6 military option in @entity4
she opposes " involving ourselves in another civil war ... in another country "
lawmakers disagree on whether @entity6 should work with @entity129
