a developer who spent three years helping create @entity2 has written a brutal blog post declaring the tech giant 's social network a failure			1
in a lengthy , at times profane breakdown on blogging platform medium , @entity7 , the man credited as inventor of the hashtag , writes that @entity12 missed a chance to make the service a one - stop home for its users ' online identities and , instead , created a less - popular @entity19 copycat			1
" lately , i just feel like @entity2 is confused and adrift at sea , " @entity7 wrote			1
" it 's so far behind , how can it possibly catch up ? " the november 28 post was a follow - up to a tweet in which he had mistakenly called out a bug on @entity2 that was actually caused by an external app. even as he corrected himself , he called out @entity12 for the network 's missed opportunity			1
" i f --- ed up , " @entity7 wrote			0
" @entity7 left @entity12 over a year ago to join a startup			1
before that , he had worked on the short - lived @entity34 social product , then @entity2			2
he wrote that while it was being developed under the code name " @entity2 , " @entity2 was internally being called " @entity12			2
" the idea at the time , he said , was to make the site a sort of home base for users , where they would decide which information they 'd like to share about themselves and with whom they 'd like to share it			0
" it was like @entity12 was saying , ' we 're going to be your trusted partner in cyberspace , and we 'll help you surface the right information to the people you choose , at the right time ' , " @entity7 wrote			2
" it was a functional search - oriented value proposition , rather than a social networking one			0
" thus , for me , when i searched for my mom 's phone number on @entity12 , i actually find it -- because it would be on her profile and she would have shared it with me			0
suddenly a query like ' mom phone number ' would work			0
" instead , he wrote , @entity2 became " a kind of @entity64			0
" " why did the world need another @entity19 , unless to benefit @entity12 by making their ad targeting more effective ? " @entity7 wrote			1
@entity12 did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment for this article			0
@entity7 wrote that innovation appears to be slowing for the web tool			2
in a chart , he said @entity2 and hangouts , its well - liked video chat tool , have been updated with six apps each in 2014 , compared with 15 for @entity76 and 16 for @entity77 , both of which are also @entity12 properties , and 19 for @entity19 , 29 for @entity81 and 33 for @entity82			1
aside from his personal interest , @entity7 said he 's disappointed because @entity19 , with its more than 1.3 billion users , needs competition			2
" the future of digital identity should not be determined by one company ( namely , @entity19 ) , " he said			0
" i still believe that competition in this space is better for consumers , for startups , and for the industry			0
and @entity12 still remains one of the few companies ( besides @entity96 , perhaps ) that stands a chance to take on @entity19 in this arena -- but @entity2 , as i see it , has lost its way			1

former @entity2 developer says the social tool has failed
@entity106 inventor @entity7 left @entity12 over a year ago
he says g *+* could have been about identity , became " @entity19 lite "
