-- energy ministers at wednesday 's @entity3 meeting in @entity4 agreed to maintain oil production levels , after negotiating in the shadow of flaring violence in the second - biggest city of @entity9 , one of the consortium 's key producers			1
more than 500,000 citizens have fled @entity14 as extremist militants overrun the town			0
the impact of the insurgency has so far been limited , but a drive into the deep south , around @entity21 , or further into the @entity23 region , could quickly alter the dynamics of the oil market			0
the @entity3 agenda has also been destabilized by complications on the path to an agreement between world powers and @entity31 over its nuclear program			1
further , chaos continues to reign in @entity34 , which has brought down the country 's production to an eighth of its pre-war average of 1.6 million barrels a day			1
@entity3 agreed to keep production at 30 million barrels a day , despite rising production from @entity9 and @entity31			1
they will meet again in @entity4 in november			0
in a statement , @entity3 said member countries affirmed they would " if required , take steps to ensure market balance which is so important to world economic activity			2
" further , they " reiterated their willingness to firmly respond to developments that might jeopardize oil market stability			0
" strategists say the cartel 's traditional swing producer @entity54 ( the one that balances market demand for @entity3 crude ) may need to step in to produce a record 11 million barrels a day to fill a potential void			2
the @entity58 moved to increase production capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day when the former government in @entity31 threatened to chock off exports through the @entity62			1
the situation could be much worse for the group that produces about 40 % of the world 's daily oil output			2
these countries -- dominated by the major players of the @entity69 -- have enjoyed triple digit oil prices , meaning $ 100 or more , for three years			1
this has kept export revenues within @entity3 above $ 1 trillion since 2011			2
so far , we are witnessing the same scenario playing out in 2014			0
four investment banks raised their annual forecasts for @entity77 based on the uncertainty that prevails over supply			0
at the same time , @entity81 - based think tank the @entity80 said that @entity3 production would need to rise in the second half since inventories for april were at their lowest level since 2008			1
that amounts to a 180 degree turn in sentiment from the last time @entity3 members convened in december			2
with @entity92 output at a 30 - year high as a result of the shale oil and gas boom , many expected @entity3 members to be vying amongst themselves for global market share			1
the @entity69 uncertainty is allowing @entity3 to delay tough decisions			1
long - time rivals @entity31 and @entity9 both say they will take production to four million barrels a day in 2015 , if geo - politics and violence do not stand in the way			1
