the " kill switch , " a system for remotely disabling smartphones and wiping their data , will become standard in 2015 , according to a pledge backed by most of the mobile world 's major players			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , along with the five biggest cellular carriers in the @entity9 , are among those that have signed on to a voluntary program announced tuesday by the industry 's largest trade group			1
all smartphones manufactured for sale in the @entity9 after july 2015 must have the technology , according to the program from @entity22			1
advocates say the feature would deter thieves from taking mobile devices by rendering phones useless while allowing people to protect personal information if their phone is lost or stolen			2
its proponents include law enforcement officials concerned about the rising problem of smartphone theft			0
" we appreciate the commitment made by these companies to protect wireless users in the event their smartphones are lost or stolen , " said @entity36 , president and ceo of @entity22			1
" this flexibility provides consumers with access to the best features and apps that fit their unique needs while protecting their smartphones and the valuable information they contain			1
" @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 are among the other smartphone makers who have signed up , along with carriers @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			2
the feature would let a phone 's owner erase contacts , photos , e-mail and other information , and lock the phone so it ca n't be used without a password			0
the feature , which will be offered at no cost to consumers , also will prevent the phone from being reactivated without an authorized user 's consent			0
the data would be retrievable if the owner recovers the phone			0
some phone makers already include the ability to remotely wipe phones			1
in @entity10 's latest mobile operating system , @entity81 7 , a feature called @entity83 lets users prevent their phones from being reactivated even if they 're reset			1
the new pledge marks a reversal for wireless carriers , who have resisted making the kill - switch feature mandatory			1
industry representatives have said they fear hackers exploiting remote - kill technology , while critics accuse the industry of not wanting to lose revenue from replacing and activating stolen phones			2
carriers have faced mounting pressure from lawmakers , some of whom are working on laws at the state level that would require remote shutdown capability			0
in @entity108 , the state legislature could pass a mandatory kill - switch bill as early as next week			1
@entity111 state sen. @entity110 , president of the @entity112 , said his group " applauds today 's announcement unveiling the wireless industry 's commitment to reduce the number of smartphone thefts each year by providing anti-theft tools on future devices			0
" " this voluntary effort serves as another positive illustration of the wireless industry adapting to address consumer needs through self - regulation , " he said			0
but an optional deal did n't go far enough for others			0
" the wireless industry today has taken an incremental yet inadequate step to address the epidemic of smartphone theft , " said @entity129 state sen. @entity128 , who represents parts of @entity131 , in a statement			0
" only weeks ago , they claimed that the approach they are taking today was infeasible and counterproductive			0
" @entity128 fears that because consumers would need to activate the feature , many phones would remain unprotected			2
" while i am encouraged they are moving off of that position so quickly , today 's ' opt - in ' proposal misses the mark if the ultimate goal is to combat street crime and violent thefts involving smartphones and tablets			2
