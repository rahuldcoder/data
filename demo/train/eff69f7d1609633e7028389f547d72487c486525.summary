@entity0 , @entity1 -- it may surprise the casual visitor at @entity5 to see a rubber duck on a headstone or an old football helmet lying in the manicured grass of a fallen soldier 's grave			1
after all , @entity13 's most hallowed ground is the final resting place for war heroes , astronauts , even two @entity13 presidents			2
but it happens all the time , especially in @entity17 , where many of those killed in the current wars are buried			1
leaving a flower arrangement is still common			2
and many graves have tiny @entity13 flags placed on them			2
but this new generation of warriors are frequently remembered with mementos like cans of beer , teddy bears and even tiny bottles of hot sauce			1
the message in the mementos is unknown but likely very personal			1
" i have seen everything from report cards to an @entity38 football ticket stub , " said @entity33 , a curator with the @entity34			2
" obviously , the deceased service person was a @entity38 fan			2
i 've seen jewelry , lots of things			2
" @entity33 is part of a new effort by the @entity47 to make sure these items do n't end up in the trash			1
for the first time the @entity47 , which runs @entity5 , is collecting many of the items left on the graves , cataloging them according to what grave they were left on and storing them for posterity			1
before this effort began late last summer , most of the items were thrown away			1
some cemetery employees tried to gather some special mementos , but no record was kept about what graves those items came from			1
now , curators from the @entity34 are making sure a thorough record is kept			1
" we are going by , grave to grave , on a weekly basis recovering items that have been left and then we basically put these items into a database and photograph the grave , " @entity33 said			0
read about the demanding work of @entity0 's burial crews then the mementos are put into plastic bags with a note card with the date of collection , the fallen service member 's name and the grave number			1
perishable items like food or flowers are left on the grave			0
but if a note is attached , it 's collected and saved			0
a plain pebble on top of a headstone will be left alone , but if someone has written or painted something personal on the stone , it will be saved			1
they even save some of the empty beer and liquor bottles that often turn up next to the headstones			1
and on some graves , like that of @entity96			0
@entity97 , nothing is disturbed			0
@entity97 's mother asked the @entity47 not to collect anything off his grave and the curators gladly respect her wishes			1
there was a case where some items were collected from a grave , but the family did n't want the items moved , so the center returned the materials to the family			1
the curators also pay attention to when the materials are left			0
if they are birthday cards and a birthday is approaching , they will usually leave them			2
but if the birthday has passed , they will collect them			0
while @entity33 does this job every week , some things still get to him			0
like a poem left on @entity123			0
@entity125 's grave that reads : " in @entity0 , a small white stone there , a small white stone , three little pebbles , an inscription , and a patch of green grass			0
that 's where he 'll stay			0
he should be home laughing with kids or still serving his country			0
but instead , he stays there			0
" the poem is signed " @entity140			0
" but it 's unclear why it was left on @entity125 's grave			0
were they relatives , friends or just patriotic @entity13 who wanted to remember a fallen soldier ? once the poem and all other mementos have been collected , catalogued and saved , the @entity47 secretary will decide what will be done with them			1
they may become part of a museum exhibit			0
or maybe , someday , a historian will go through them to teach about the two wars .			2

most fallen soldiers of current wars are buried in @entity17
*people* leave personal mementos , *including* cans of beer and hot sauce
