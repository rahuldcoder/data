-- @entity1 and @entity2 judged their race strategy perfectly to pip @entity4 to the checkered flag during an action packed @entity8 @entity7 at @entity9			1
the @entity10 maneuvered expertly through 52 immensely tactical laps to record his second victory of the season , though @entity14 's @entity4 did maintain his lead in the drivers ' championship			1
with the torrential rain that had affected the build up absent for the entire race , @entity1 hunted down @entity4 in the closing stages as the @entity22 's tires began to wear , eventually overtaking on lap 49			1
defending double world champion @entity23 , also of @entity2 , came third while @entity4 's @entity14 teammate @entity24 finished fourth			1
@entity9 support : does home advantage help in @entity27 ? " it was a very interesting race			1
@entity4 had very good pace , " @entity1 told a press conference after his victory			1
" we had the better strategy in the end			0
we never gave up , kept pushing and it did not work out in the end for @entity4			2
" i 've had a few wins , but this one is taking a little bit to sink in			2
it did n't look like a spectacular race between us initially , but it was one -- pacing the stints on the tires , @entity4 starting on the harder tire			2
" after the first stint @entity4 had i thought he was in good shape to close the win out			2
but it came our way and i am absolutely over the moon			0
" i had a single opportunity to pounce and i was n't going to let that slip			0
@entity4 , with the front - left tire , if you lose balance around this place , the speed is very high in that second sector and it 's very hard for the driver to do something			2
" it was obvious he was pushing as hard as possible but the balance was n't with him			0
" it was @entity1 's second win at @entity9 in three years and helped him cut @entity4 's lead at the top of the drivers ' standings to 13 points			1
@entity4 has 129 to @entity1 's 116 , with @entity23 third on 100 points			1
@entity4 said : " it was very close today but at the end @entity1 was much quicker than us and deserved the victory			1
now we are fighting for victories in the last three or four grands prix			0
" i hope the fans enjoyed the show today			0
i 'm still leading the championship and that 's the main target for us , we lost seven points with @entity1 winning but we gained some more points on the rest of the field			1
" world champion @entity23 added : " @entity1 deserved to win			1
thanks for all fans out there -- it 's been horrible weather for them , not just for us			0
but today the sun came out and @entity8 summer showed its best			2
" starting on pole , @entity4 protected his lead even after a pit stop on lap 16 but the hard tires on @entity100 's @entity99 car set up a tussle for first place on lap 19			1
the lead changed hands several times as the former @entity99 teammates battled round the circuit			0
eventually , @entity4 came out on top and @entity1 moved up to third when @entity100 pitted			1
the @entity22 was forced into his own stop for a set of compulsory soft tires as a furious round of strategic stops took place around lap 38			0
and try as he might , @entity4 could n't hold off @entity1 as his tires faded fast , allowing the @entity10 to make his decisive move three laps from home			1
there was also controversy further down the field as @entity125 's @entity124 blasted his @entity127 counterpart @entity126 for a crash that put the @entity129 out of the race			2
@entity124 said of the @entity131 : " he does n't respect other drivers			0
i was already in front and he should have given space not to crash , but he tried to push me all the way			0
" i do n't understand why he drives like that and i hope the stewards do something			0
it is not first time he has damaged my weekend			0
this guy will never learn if they do n't do something			0
everybody has concerns about him			0
" @entity126 was later reprimanded and fined $ 12,000 by the sport 's governing body , the @entity147 , for the collision while @entity125 driver @entity150 from @entity151 was fined $ 30,000 for injuring three three mechanics during a pit - stop			0
