-- @entity1 may play host to the world 's most lucrative football league but the country 's national team is facing a fight to compete on the biggest stage of all			1
with just two months until the @entity10 kicks off in @entity11 , @entity1 manager @entity12 laid bare the nature of his problems for picking a squad capable of challenging in @entity16			1
while the @entity19 has gone from strength to strength and attracted some of the world 's most famous players , @entity18 football has stood still			1
the @entity1 has only reached the semifinals once since winning the @entity10 on home soil in 1966			1
speaking at a news conference at @entity28 , @entity12 revealed he may be forced to pick players who have not appeared regularly for their club sides this season -- claiming nearly 30 % of his squad will consist of " players who when you see their names , wo n't be regular players in their first team and certainly wo n't be first names on the team sheet			2
" he added : " if you go back a long time , that would have been unthinkable			0
" in my youth , it would have been unthinkable for anyone to play for @entity1 who was n't a complete and utter star in his own team			2
" according to a survey recorded last season , just over a third of all players in the @entity19 are eligible to represent @entity1			2
the pool of players available to @entity12 has shrunk further following injuries to @entity57 's @entity56 and @entity59 's @entity58 , who are both expected to miss the tournament			1
and while the talented trio of @entity63 's @entity62 , @entity65 's @entity64 and @entity59 's @entity66 have all recently emerged , @entity12 accepts that @entity1 may have to get used to its younger players being left out in the cold			1
" it 's a bit of a transitional period and it 's something us in @entity1 will have to get used to because some of the best players that we have as young players are at the top clubs , " he added			1
" because they 're at the top clubs in the country , they 're competing with the very best that the foreign market can sell to us			0
" it 's harder for them because they 're competing with other world stars			2
" @entity1 was heavily criticized for its poor showing in @entity85 four years ago after going out in the second round following a humiliating defeat by @entity88			0
@entity89 , who coached that particular team , told @entity0 last month that @entity1 will never succeed at the @entity10 because its players play too many games			1
while @entity12 accepts that @entity89 's assertion has some truth , he refuses to accept that tiredness will derail his team 's chances of success in @entity11			1
" of course , you ca n't say he ( @entity89 ) is wrong in saying that but it 's a fact of life we can do nothing about , " @entity12 told @entity0			2
" tournaments are played in the summer and played very , very quickly after a long season ends			0
we also can not deny that the @entity19 is a more intensive league than many others -- it 's probably the most if i 'm brutally honest			0
" we 've got that problem to deal with but all we can do is to accept it and try not to use it as an excuse			0
" we will try to do everything we can during our time together to make sure we do n't treat everybody the same			0
" perhaps if a player has played more games than another or a bit more tired than another then maybe we can take that into account			0
" but having said that , i 'm pretty certain that 's been done in the past as well			0
there 's no guarantee that will be the ultimate solution -- but it 's the only thing we can do			0
