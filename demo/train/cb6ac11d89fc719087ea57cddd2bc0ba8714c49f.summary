-- not even the @entity2 spy agencies that inspired @entity3 can solve the mystery of a secret @entity6 message recently found on the skeleton of a carrier pigeon in a house chimney			1
the meaning of the encoded message apparently died about 70 years ago with the wayward pigeon that @entity13 found in his smokestack in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17			1
@entity13 recently discovered the bird 's remains with the surprisingly intact message inside a small red canister attached to a leg bone			1
the only hope appears to be curators at the @entity25 at @entity26 , who are now trying to trace the origins of two alphanumeric identifiers for the pigeon that were also written on the message , the @entity32 intelligence agency @entity31 said this week			1
" if they are identified and their wartime service established , it could help to decode the message , " the agency said about the pigeon 's identity numbers			1
to the casual reader , the message is indecipherable			2
hand - written on a small piece of paper labeled " @entity44 , " the note consists of five - letter words			0
those words do n't make sense : the jumble begins with " @entity49 " and " @entity50			2
" in all , the message consists of 27 five - letter code groups			2
read the full encoded message ( @entity54 ) deciphering the message requires codebooks and possibly a " one - time pad " encryption system , and those materials " will normally have been destroyed once no longer in use , " the agency said			1
there is a small chance that a codebook survived			0
" without access to the relevant codebooks and details of any additional encryption used , it will remain impossible to decrypt , " the agency said			0
the one - time pad encryption gave the note added security			0
a random key is used to encrypt only one message			0
" the advantage of this system is that , if used correctly , it is unbreakable as long as the key is kept secret , " the agency said			0
" the disadvantage is that both the sending and receiving parties need to have access to the same key , which usually means producing and sharing a large keypad in advance			0
" heightening the mystery are three other issues : the message is undated , the meaning of its destination of " @entity89 " is unknown , and analysts ca n't identify the sender 's signature or his unit			1
" unfortunately , much of the vital information that would indicate the context of the message is missing , " the intelligence service said			0
coded notes : a whodunit without an answer the sender 's sign - off appears to say " @entity104 , " using an abbreviation for " serjeant , " an old - fashioned spelling for " sergeant , " the agency said			1
the use of " @entity111 " links the message to the army , the spy agency said			2
" if ' @entity114 ' and @entity115 could be identified , it could give us a better idea of where to look for the information , " the agency said			0
about 250,000 pigeons were used during @entity6 by all branches of the military and the @entity124 , the @entity32 intelligence agency said			1
flying from mainland @entity125 to @entity2 , the birds heroically delivered all sorts of messages through a gauntlet of enemy hawk patrols and potshots from soldiers			0
" although it is disappointing that we can not yet read the message brought back by a brave carrier pigeon , it is a tribute to the skills of the wartime code - makers that , despite working under severe pressure , they devised a code that was undecipherable both then and now , " said @entity31 , one of three @entity32 intelligence agencies			1
code talker from @entity6 dies			2

the skeleton of a @entity6 carrier pigeon is found in a man 's chimney in @entity17
a red canister attached to a leg bone holds a coded message @entity32 agency ca n't crack
meanwhile , a pigeon *museum* seeks *clues* in the bird 's identification numbers
