-- as explosions and gunfire continued to ripple in @entity3 , the @entity5 high commissioner for human rights on monday raised the death toll from the @entity9 government 's crackdown on anti-regime activists to close to 5,000 people			1
" this situation is intolerable , " @entity12 said in a briefing for the @entity14			1
the same day that @entity12 spoke , the @entity17 - based @entity16 and a resident of @entity19 -- an opposition hotbed and frequent site of violence in recent months -- reported that a gas pipeline exploded near the city , followed by gunfire and circulating military airplanes			1
the state - run @entity27 , or @entity27 , played up local elections monday as an expression of " democracy and free will			0
" yet the @entity19 resident said there was no evidence of voting in that city			1
instead , this witness reported nonstop shooting and bombardments			0
such violence is nothing new in @entity3 , with @entity12 reporting more than 200 people have died in the last 10 days , and " the @entity3 population continues to live in fear of further violent repression			1
" the @entity3 government , meanwhile , has consistently blamed the violence on " armed terrorist " gang members and denied any efforts to target peaceful civilians			1
@entity0 can not independently confirm events because the @entity3 government restricts access of international media to the country			1
@entity12 said monday that " the nature and scale of abuses " indicate that @entity3 forces likely committed " crimes against humanity			1
" citing reliable sources , she said more than 300 of the dead have been children " killed by state forces			0
" several defectors from military and security forces said they got orders " to shoot unarmed protesters without warning , " according to @entity12			0
" independent , credible and corroborated accounts demonstrate that these abuses have taken place as part of a widespread and systematic attack on civilians , " she said			0
@entity19 has been a regular flash point			2
as nightfall arrived monday , many city residents went to bed afraid the steady waves of violence could soon give way to a historic siege			0
opposition figures said the @entity3 government had warned people in @entity19 to stop anti-government protests , hand in weapons and surrender defecting military members by monday night -- or face attack by government forces			1
@entity3 forces gave a 72 - hour warning , said lt. col. @entity94 of the @entity95 , an opposition group of defected @entity3 military personnel			1
activists on the ground said the ultimatum was issued friday for @entity19			1
the government has not acknowledged any deadline for @entity19 in state - run media			2
@entity94 said there are concerns about a repeat of what happened in 1982 , when @entity3 's military -- acting under orders from then - president @entity110 , father of current @entity3 leader @entity111 -- launched an assault on the city of @entity114 , killing thousands			2
" people are very afraid , " said @entity116 , a human rights activist in @entity117 , @entity118 , with the organization @entity120 , who is in touch with people in @entity3			2
there are enough troops around @entity19 " to take over the city , " he said , and casualties have been increasing " in very big numbers " over the past couple of days			2
@entity94 said the military has dug trenches around @entity19 and largely cut it off			2
" there is no electricity , water , and the communication lines are much worse			0
the food supply is also decreasing , mainly because little food is going in , " he said			0
the @entity3 government denied reports of water and electricity being out in the city , according to a @entity27 report			1
in fact , besides a story about seven " army , security and police martyrs " being buried monday , state - run media did not report much on such dire conditions or violence			0
rather , state tv painted a picture of normalcy , with reports of local elections under way across the country			0
@entity27 noted that more than 3,000 candidates are vying for seats in the @entity19 region alone			2
it billed the elections as part of the " process of building institutions , promoting democracy and achieving the comprehensive reform process led by president @entity111			0
" activist groups , though , offered a different story			0
the @entity172 , a network of opposition activists in the country , said monday the @entity3 army and security forces killed 21 people , including four women and three children			1
thirteen of the deaths were in @entity19 , three were in @entity114 , three in @entity9 suburbs and two in @entity185			2
and fierce clashes broke out between security forces and defectors in the cities of @entity190 and @entity185 , according to the @entity16 , which collects information from people in different parts of the country			0
@entity94 , from the @entity95 said , " we conducted an operation late last night against the @entity3 forces in @entity185 and killed eight of them and injured 22			1
two of our men are critically injured			0
" he also said @entity3 forces were conducting mass arrests of shop owners who shut their stores sunday as part of a nationwide anti-government strike			1
the @entity3 government , via @entity27 , on sunday quoted people saying there was no strike and no sign of a strike			2
the last nine months has seen a steady stream of clashes , amid reported government push - back against activists demanding democratic elections and the end of @entity111 's regime			0
@entity220 has been in power since 2000 ; his father ruled @entity3 for three decades			2

" @entity12 's report especially drew strong responses from representative countries ' ambassadors to the @entity5			1
@entity250 's ambassador , @entity249 , called it " the most horrifying briefing that we 've had in the @entity14 over the last two years , " citing the thousands of deaths and " tens of thousands of detentions , rapes , torture ( and ) violations of abuses right across the system by the @entity3 regime			1
@entity263 ambassador @entity262 said his country is " shocked and appalled " by the @entity5 human rights branch 's view of the situation , calling it " unbearable " that the @entity14 appears " condemned to remain silent on @entity3			1
" " we share the assessment that the @entity3 security forces have committed crimes against humanity this year , " he said			1
