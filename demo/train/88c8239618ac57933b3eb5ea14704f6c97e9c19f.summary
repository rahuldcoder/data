-- an armed @entity2 organization which had pledged to protect a @entity4 church as it holds " @entity9 " withdrew its support from the event wednesday , saying it " does not glorify @entity7 , " according to a posting on its website			1
@entity12 , which describes itself as a @entity2 conservative group , also said in the posting it is asking the @entity14 , based in @entity15 , @entity4 , not to hold the event " for the reason that it may diminish the work of the @entity19 to witness to @entity20			1
" the event is planned for the ninth anniversary of the september 11 terror attacks			1
while the group agrees with the @entity26 's stance on @entity27 , press coverage of recent events , such as " @entity9 , " a recent " @entity38 " group on @entity32 and the controversy surrounding a proposed mosque and @entity27 community center near ground zero in @entity37 is " really inciting a lot of hatred and a lot of violence that 's going on , " @entity12 founder @entity30 told @entity0			1
" we do n't want to be a part of inciting violence and racism anymore			2
" the group 's website posting said it believes the " liberal media " is intentionally using such stories " to distract , divide and enrage the public			1
" @entity30 said he had not yet spoken to @entity14 pastor @entity52 , but plans to sometime wednesday			1
contacted by @entity0 , the @entity53 said it was unaware of the development			1
" of course , we are very surprised , and of course disappointed , " @entity52 said			1
" i talked to ( @entity30 ) personally and he was very excited about the stand that we had taken against @entity27			2
he had already reviewed a lot of our information , @entity61 ( videos ) -- he was 100 percent supportive in what we were doing			2
" @entity30 said since pledging its support and saying it would provide protection for the @entity26 , " we 've all received several death threats " from the @entity70 and beyond			0
the group has been in contact with the @entity73 , he said			2
@entity30 said he believes other groups may follow @entity12 and withdraw their support from the event as well			1
he said he will ask the @entity26 not to hold the event , but does not know whether they will proceed			1
" we 're not against them , we 're just pulling our support , " he said			0
@entity52 pointed out that @entity12 had contacted the @entity53 to offer its help along with financial support , not vice versa			1
" there was at that time absolutely no indication that they were not supportive , " @entity52 said			0
" i can only come to the conclusion -- it seems very , very obvious -- they ... have bowed to fear or to pressure from other organizations , other groups			0
" he said the group has taken the easy way out by saying " @entity7 would not do this			1
" but , @entity52 said , that 's not the point of the event			1
" this is sending a clear warning to radical @entity27 that they are not welcome in @entity70			0
" he said the church will proceed with the event			1
@entity52 told @entity0 in an e-mail on tuesday he had accepted the support of @entity12 , which he said offered to come to the church with between 500 and 2,000 men			1
@entity52 described the organization as an armed civilian militia group			2
" there is a need for this protection , " @entity52 wrote in an e-mail			0
" it is absolutely necessary in light of the death and terror threats we have received			0
we have met with the @entity73 who have warned us of the threats they have seen , not only against us but against other targets in @entity4			0
we have personally received threats by phone and many by mail			0
" @entity12 said in its web posting wednesday , " @entity125 are our brothers and sisters in @entity128			1
however , we ask that they not hold this event for the reason that it may diminish the work of the @entity19 to witness to @entity20			2
" @entity70 is a nation founded on the @entity134 , " it said			0
" @entity137 , our form of government , our laws and our freedoms come directly from the @entity134			0
sharia law , however is based not on freedom , but totalitarianism			0
" the system oppresses women and freedom of speech , along with " basic rights that @entity70 have fought and died for , " the group said			2
but , @entity30 noted wednesday , " we need to calm down here ... the whole violence thing , this is going to get real ugly real quick if this keeps stewing			0
" on tuesday , @entity30 said in a statement sent to @entity0 by the @entity26 that " we fully support @entity14 and its efforts to put an end to the notion that @entity27 is a peaceful religion			0
@entity27 is a violent cult with the goal of world domination			0
" he repeated that on wednesday			0
" it 's not that we do n't agree with @entity162 's stance on @entity27 , because we believe it 's not a religion , but a cult			2
we do have freedom of religion but when it is a violent religion , or cult , as @entity27 is , that is invading our nation , we do n't support that , " he said			0
@entity30 said he has spoken with @entity52 and his staff on the issue previously			0
@entity30 said @entity12 is opposed to the plan to build the mosque and @entity27 community center near the site of the attacks on the @entity178 in @entity37 , saying it 's " spitting in the face " of the 9/11 families			1
@entity52 said freedom of religion in @entity70 means " @entity20 are more than free to worship here , which is not the case in sharia law - dominated countries			0
they only have to respect and obey the @entity188 " and not force sharia law on others , he said			0
" this is just a typical giving in to pressure and fear , " he said of @entity12 's withdrawal			1
muslims and many other @entity196 , including some evangelicals , are fighting the church 's plan to burn the @entity200			1
