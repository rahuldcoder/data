-- yesterday independent film 's glitterati bundled up in their sweaters and ear muffs for the start of the @entity7			1
and since we all know that today 's @entity7 movies are tomorrow 's breakout hits and the movies we 'll all be betting on come next year 's award season , here are eight movies on the lineup that have me salivating			2
here 's hoping they 'll be in theaters soon			2
" @entity19 " : back in the 1970s , scientists conducted an experiment an a young chimp named @entity23			1
if they raised him like a human , would he learn to communicate using sign language ? in this doc , brought to you by the guy who made the amazing " @entity30 , " you 'll find out how it went down -- and say " awwww " a bunch			2
" @entity33 " : we adore @entity35 and this movie sets her on the @entity37 in 1845			1
it 'll be a quiet movie , but we predict that with @entity35 in the lead , bonnets will become the new cool girl thing to wear			1
" @entity43 " : @entity44 is n't just one of the most beautiful women in @entity47 , in my humble opinion -- she 's also the smartest			0
this flick is her directorial debut , about a woman who spends 20 years in a fundamentalist commune and finally decides to leave			0
" @entity53 " : we love @entity55 , so will forgive the fact that the plot of her new movie -- a 30 - something couple slowly falls apart -- sounds an awful lot like " @entity61 , " only with brown , curly hair rather than blondes			0
we also hear that it 's narrated by a cat ? " @entity66 " : we 're still so glad that @entity68 's beard was grown for a movie and not just because			1
in this comedy , @entity68 stars as the slacker brother of three uber - ambituous sisters , played by @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity75			1
" @entity77 " : @entity78 , the man who ate @entity79 for science in " @entity81 , " takes on the world of product placement in this new doc. the twist ? the movie is funded by the products you see in it			0
" @entity90 " : long - distance relationships are rough			0
this movie , which already has some great buzz going , tells the story of a young couple that meets in college and then has to split when one of them has to return to the @entity100			1
" @entity101 " : @entity103 's publicity stunt for his new religious horror film is ... that he wo n't be doing any publicity for it			0
oh , and he 'll be auctioning off the rights			0
put in a bid on sunday			0
