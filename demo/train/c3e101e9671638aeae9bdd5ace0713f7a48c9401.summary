@entity0 -- after weeks of military analysts examining the latest @entity5 rocket before and after its failed launch , the focus now has turned to a truck			1
it 's not just any truck			2
it 's known as a " transporter , erector , launcher , " tel for short , and is designed to move a long - range missile into place , stand it upright and launch it from just about anywhere in @entity5			1
the truck was spotted in a military parade in @entity18 last weekend with what experts say is a new long - range rocket on board			1
the @entity25 is investigating if the @entity26 came from @entity27 in violation of @entity25 resolutions , a @entity24 official tells @entity1			1
the @entity31 committee that monitors implementation of the sanctions on @entity5 is investigating , the official said			1
the investigation was first reported by @entity35			2
asked about the tel during a hearing thursday of the @entity30 , secretary of defense @entity36 said , " i 'm sure there 's been some help coming from @entity27			1
i do n't know , you know , the exact extent of that			0
" @entity43 of the @entity44 agrees			0
" there is no question that there is a long history in the past of @entity27 and @entity5 cooperation on missile technology			1
" but he cautioned that " until you can absolutely confirm that the system was made in @entity27 and is a violation of the missile technology regime , that does not mean that because something came out of @entity27 it 's a violation of any of @entity27 's agreements			1
" @entity61 , a missile analyst for @entity63 , points out the truck may not have been made in @entity27			1
" it may be an offshoot derivation that the @entity5 built themselves , but basically it 's the same design , " he said			1
or @entity27 may have sold the truck to @entity5 in the years before the sanctions were in place			1
" that is not clear , how it arrived there , but it 's a commercially available tractor truck , " @entity61 said			2
as for the rocket / missile the truck was carrying			2
few experts are willing to say what was seen in the parade was real , " i think you create parade missiles for public display that do n't have all the external equipment that 's on them versus the real flight vehicles			2
" @entity61 is convinced that the rocket , if there 's a real version , would be an adaptation of old @entity90 technology , not a new version of it 's @entity93			0
" this is a new design , a much more compact design			0
" @entity43 said there is much we do n't know about the rocket			0
" there are times when none of us really know since we ca n't look inside the skin , " he said			0
" none of us have the faintest idea			0
first we do n't know if it 's real , ( and ) if it is real you need to talk about reliability or the guidance system			0
" on that point even @entity36 , who used to be @entity111 director , agrees : " i have to tell you we need , frankly , to get better intelligence as to exactly what those capabilities are , exactly , you know , what 's real and what 's not real here , in order to determine exactly what that threat represents			0
" but @entity5 's recent failed launch demonstrated that it has made little progress in developing long - range missiles , according to the director of the @entity128			2
lt. gen. @entity129 told a congressional committee earlier this week , " our experience has been you need a lot of testing and flight testing in order to validate and have reliance in the capability			0
they do not , and it 's been evident every time they test			0
and their progress has not been made apparent in this latest flight test			0
