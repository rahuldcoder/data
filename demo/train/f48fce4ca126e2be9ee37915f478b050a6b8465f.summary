it was n't supposed to turn into a cold case mystery -- or possibly solve a couple , for that matter -- when highway patrol trooper @entity4 took new sonar equipment out to an @entity7 lake on a training mission last week			1
but boy have things changed			2
the discovery of two submerged cars -- probably there for decades -- and the six bodies inside them have folks in western @entity7 wondering whether two old mysteries can now be put aside			1
the biggest question remains unanswered			2
how did the cars -- which faced different directions -- come to be in the lake ? the cars turned out to be a 1969 @entity24 and a 1952 @entity25 , sitting just 50 feet from a marina and 12 feet underwater			1
@entity29 levels are now 13 feet below normal because of a drought			2
their discovery was certainly a surprise			2
@entity4 was testing the high - tech sonar on september 10 when he saw something he did n't expect at the bottom of @entity29			1
" i noticed that they were cars with this side - scan sonar , " he said			2
" it puts off a very good image and very detailed			2
i knew for a fact they were cars and they were pretty close to one another			2
" the cars appear to match the descriptions of the vehicles in two cases that have remained mysteries for decades			2
@entity51 sheriff @entity50 told @entity52 that one of the cars , the @entity24 , may have belonged to 16 - year - old @entity55 , a @entity56 teenager who disappeared in 1970 with two friends : @entity58 and @entity59 , both 18			1
the three teenagers went missing the night of november 20 , 1970 , when they went for a ride around @entity56 in @entity55 ' blue camaro with a white top , according to the @entity64 , a volunteer organization that helps law enforcement solve cold cases			1
@entity55 bought the used @entity24 just six days before he went missing , and the muscle car was the envy of teenage boys at the time , said @entity71 , publisher of the @entity73 and @entity75 @entity74 newspaper			1
@entity59 was @entity76 and , according to @entity71 , was said to be a descendent of @entity78 , the legendary @entity80 chief who led defeated lt. col. @entity81 in the @entity82 in 1876			1
local residents regarded @entity59 as an @entity80 princess , @entity71 said			2
@entity55 and his two passengers were supposed to go to a football game , but they may have gone hunting instead , @entity71 said			0
@entity55 was a hunter , @entity71 said , and in fact , two rifles were found , rusted and corroded , in the @entity24			1
the three teens never returned home			0
at the time , the family posted a $ 500 reward in the local newspaper for " information leading to the finding of @entity55 and subsequent meeting his parents , " with a phone number			0
tipsters could collect , the ad says			0
more recently , @entity55 ' brother @entity101 , who works on an offshore oil rig , raised the reward to $ 10,000 in 2009 , @entity71 said			0
tantalizing clues emerged this week : the @entity24 was found with all four windows rolled down and appeared to have entered the water backwards			1
the other car , a @entity25 , was found with the driver 's side door open			0
sheriff @entity50 has n't ruled out foul play , but he suggested this week that all six deaths were likely accidents			1
@entity114 said she believes the older car contains the remains of her grandfather , @entity117			0
@entity117 , then 69 , was traveling in a green @entity25 with a sibling , @entity119 , and friend @entity120 , 58 , on april 8 , 1969 , when they all went missing , said @entity122 , regional system administrator for the @entity123			1
@entity114 said she used to bring her kids out to the lake to skip rocks			1
she said she had no idea that the answer and the clues to her grandfather 's disappearance may have been just feet away underwater			0
in fact , over the years , when she and her kids drove by the lake , they wondered aloud if grandpa was in the lake , she said			1
" maybe that 's where he 's at , " she said			0
the year he disappeared had a lot of rain , perhaps allowing a deeper lake to hide its secrets better , she said			1
authorities did n't know what they had until tuesday , when they sent down @entity148 , a diver with the @entity150 's underwater search and recovery team			1
and even then , it was tough to know anything for certain			0
visibility is only about 4 inches at the bottom of the lake			1
there 's lots of murky muck to sift through			0
" you ca n't see anything , " @entity148 said			1
" you basically just go down there and feel with your hands			0
it 's just a blind feel			0
" still , he found a shoe , so they attached a tow cable and pulled the cars out			0
" it did n't really cross my mind as to a body being in it , " @entity148 said			1
" it could have been a shoe , but whenever we brought them up to the shore ... you could see the skeletal remains in them			0
" a second search by the diver found a skull and a few other bones			0
@entity7 deputies pull bodies from lake ; may date to ' 60s , 1970 disappearances positive identification of the bodies could take years , authorities warn			2
they 'll try to match dna evidence if possible			0
the dna testing will take place at the @entity195 , which already has dna samples from @entity198 's relatives , said spokesman @entity199			0
a muddy wallet and purse could hold some clues			0
while the scientists look for answers , the troopers hope they 've provided some peace of mind			0
" we are very fortunate to get to help these people and give their family closure , for they have lost loved ones , " said @entity208 , who talked to the brother of one person missing for more than four decades			2
" they did n't know that they were kidnapped or how they 'd become missing , but i do believe that we gave them some closure ... so that they can have some resolve and serenity in their own lives			1
" evidence in killing of former beauty queen points to ex-priest four females brought back to life by new images , dna tests			0

she was in a @entity24 that her friend bought six days earlier
