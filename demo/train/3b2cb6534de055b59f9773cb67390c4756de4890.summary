-- if @entity3 's players were driven to tears after last week 's shock @entity6 exit , they could at least rely on pocketfuls of cash to ease the pain			2
sure , the world 's best football team has slipped from its throne in recent weeks after losing to @entity14 in a nail - biting @entity16 semifinal at @entity17 and also relinquishing the @entity19 crown to @entity20			2
this , after all , is the best - paid team on the planet , with each of its players earning an average $ 8.6 million a year according to a new report -- a 10 % increase on the previous year			1
but the @entity19 team , led by record - breaking goal scorer @entity32 , can take some comfort in pocketing an average $ 166,934 each in wages every week			2
the two - time @entity36 champions top the list of the highest - paid sports teams , revealed by researchers @entity40			1
the report looked at the average salaries of 278 teams in 14 leagues across 10 countries			0
@entity20 followed close behind in second place with its players earning an average $ 8.6 million a year			1
that 's a whopping $ 166,934 per week and a 6 % rise on last year			0
@entity16 soccer teams dominated the list , claiming seven of the top 10 spots			1
and as their billionaire owners continue to spend big on top - level players , traditional @entity58 sports such as baseball and basketball are being pushed down the list			0
despite not winning a @entity64 league title since 1968 , @entity62 moved up the earnings rankings from 10th to third this year -- largely thanks to the oil - rich deep pockets of owner @entity69			0
the @entity71 chief has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on star players since buying the club in august 2008			0
city players now enjoy average annual salaries of $ 7.4 million , or around $ 142,389 per week			1
and after defeating rivals @entity76 in a @entity78 battle watched by 600 million people worldwide on tuesday , @entity69 will be hoping to see returns on his mega investments			0
likewise @entity83 billionaire @entity82 will be eager for his @entity14 team -- which climbed from sixth to fourth on the rich list -- to earn their keep and deliver a @entity6 title in the may 19 final			0
his players currently boast an average $ 6.7 million a year -- around $ 130,690 a week			2
judging by the million - dollar football salaries , you 'd be forgiven for thinking the @entity92 's @entity91 regulations -- agreed in 2009 as a way of controlling clubs ' ever - rising expenditure -- had done little to stem spending			1
" it is possible but by no means certain that some wage restraint at some @entity16 football clubs is on the horizon as a result of new @entity91 rules being introduced by @entity92 , the governing body of football across @entity16			1
but the effectiveness of @entity92 's policing remains to be seen , " the @entity106 report found			2
" and in any case , the biggest , richest clubs will almost certainly continue to generate massive sums , and therefore continue to fund growing salary bills			0
" @entity58 basketball franchise the @entity114 are the first non-football team on the list , coming in at fifth with an average yearly salary of $ 6.2 million -- or $ 120,732 per week			0
next is baseball 's @entity118 in sixth place , having been top when the list was originally published two years ago			0
the report 's authors say the plummet is partly due to wages being restricted in the @entity58 since 2010 , while in @entity16 the amounts spent on top players continues to rise			0
rounding out the top 10 were baseball 's @entity129 , earning an average $ 5.8 million a year , and @entity132 soccer team @entity131 on $ 5.7 million			1
despite the @entity134 claiming just two teams in the top - 24 , basketball is still the best - paid league in the world with players earning average annual salaries of $ 4.29 million			1
in comparison , @entity19 's @entity140 is skewed towards the top end with @entity3 players earning 22 times more than the lowest teams in the 20 - club league			1
figures are from the in - progress seasons in @entity134 basketball , @entity150 ice hockey , @entity152 baseball and @entity154 football , and from the most recently completed seasons for all other teams , including the major leagues of @entity16 football , @entity159 and @entity162 @entity161 baseball .			2

@entity3 is best - paid sports team , with players earning average of $ 8.6 million a year
@entity16 football clubs dominate the list , taking seven of top 10 spots
raises *questions* over the effectiveness of @entity92 's @entity91 regulations
@entity134 is is still best - paid league in the world with average annual salaries of $ 4.29 million
