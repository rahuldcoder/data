@entity0 -- the @entity2 does n't have access to servers run by @entity6 giants @entity8 and @entity9 , its chief said in a pushback to a @entity12 report that the @entity14 spy network taps into overseas data links to slurp up millions of text , video and audio records every day			1
but gen. @entity20 's comments at a cybersecurity conference wednesday do n't appear to address the substance of the newspaper 's allegations -- that the @entity2 has found a way to tap into the data as it moves between servers around the world without many of the restrictions imposed by @entity14 law and court oversight			1
asked about the report by a @entity35 reporter who interviewed him on stage at the conference , @entity20 denied breaking into servers or databases run by @entity6 companies			2
" not to my knowledge , " he said in response to a question about tapping into company databases			0
" it would be illegal for us to do that			0
so , i do n't know what the report is , " @entity20 said			2
" but i can tell you factually we do not have access to @entity8 servers , @entity9 servers			1
we go through a court order			0
" however , the allegations published by @entity56 -- based on documents leaked by former @entity2 contractor @entity58 -- are n't that the @entity2 has hacked into data centers or databases owned by the companies			1
instead , the newspaper -- citing the @entity58 documents and unnamed " knowledgeable officials " -- reported that the @entity2 gets access to the data as it passes through vulnerable points overseas on its way to databases around the world			1
according to @entity56 , the @entity2 and the @entity72 found a way to exploit a weakness in @entity6 architecture to copy data as it moves from the public internet into data centers maintained by the companies			1
the agency then uses custom - built software to decode the companies ' internal data formats and filter the resulting data for information it wants to collect , the newspaper reported			2
the material collected under the program -- code - named muscular -- includes e-mail addressing information , as well as " content such as text , audio and video , " according to @entity56			0
the agency 's @entity97 , @entity99 , headquarters received 181,280,466 such records in the 30 days preceding the top - secret january 9 , 2013 , accounting on which @entity56 's report is based , according to the newspaper			0
in a statement , the @entity2 said " the assertion that we collect vast quantities of @entity14 persons ' data from this type of collection is also not true			1
" " @entity2 applies attorney general - approved processes to protect the privacy of @entity14 persons , " the agency said			1
it 's unclear how much of the material collected involves what the @entity2 calls " @entity14 persons , " a category that includes @entity14 citizens , permanent residents , groups predominantly made up of those groups and businesses incorporated in the @entity14			1
but unlike domestic programs that fall under restrictions imposed by law and the oversight of a secret court , surveillance conducted overseas falls under an executive order with less restrictive standards , @entity56 reported			0
the report raised concerns from @entity8 and @entity9 , with the internet behemoths saying they never gave the @entity2 permission to access communication links to their servers			1
" we have strict controls in place to protect the security of our data centers , and we have not given access to our data centers to the @entity2 or to any other government agency , " said @entity9 spokeswoman @entity139			1
@entity8 has " long been concerned about the possibility of this kind of snooping , which is why we have continued to extend encryption across more and more @entity8 services and links , " said @entity148 , @entity8 's chief legal officer			2
" we do not provide any government , including the @entity14 government , with access to our systems			0
we are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private fiber networks , and it underscores the need for urgent reform			0
" the newspaper report emerged a day after @entity20 and @entity167 , the director of national intelligence , testified before a @entity169 committee reviewing the agency 's surveillance activities			0
the hearing , billed as a discussion of potential changes to the 35 - year - old @entity175 , commonly known as @entity175 , came after a report by the @entity178 magazine @entity177 that the @entity2 monitored @entity178 chancellor @entity180 's cell phone			0
some reports also suggest the @entity14 carried out surveillance on @entity184 and @entity185 citizens			2
@entity186 reported from @entity0 ; @entity187 reported and wrote from @entity188			0
@entity1 's @entity189 contributed to this report .			0

gen. @entity20 says the @entity2 does n't break into @entity8 , @entity9 databases
but the @entity12 reports that the @entity2 accesses data as it moves between centers
@entity20 did n't appear to address that *specific* claim
the @entity2 later denies using the *technique* to " collect vast quantities of @entity14 persons ' data "
