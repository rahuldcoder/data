" i 'm very , very worried , " @entity18 told @entity1			2
" we are witnessing the gradual reoccupation of @entity0			1
" the developments came as a tenuous cease - fire both parties agreed to earlier appeared to be shattered , with at least eight militant rockets again hurtling toward @entity3 as diplomats pushed for a longer truce in a conflict that has killed more than 1,000 people -- mostly civilians			1
