-- at the 2009 @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 showed the world what electric vehicles of the future will look like			1
and the future of driving looks fun			0
the @entity12 can blast from 0 - to - 60 mph in around 4 seconds			0
those in the know realize that sometime in the future , the vast majority of light cars and trucks in the @entity18 will feature electric final drive systems			1
the motors used in these systems will be powered by batteries , fuel cells , on - board generators , and perhaps even the sun. but this open issue does n't change the inevitability of this reality			0
given our current economic times , reality demands practical , tangible , and achievable ideas of what electric vehicles ( or " @entity35 " for short ) might actually look like			2
this is it ... @entity2 three of the four electric vehicles @entity2 showed in @entity40 , @entity41 , were shown at other events and even to @entity44 bureaucrats			1
each of these vehicles is a running prototype , not some pie - in - the - sky - we 'll - never - build that idea			0
@entity51 is the special group of engineers at @entity2 that develops the company 's @entity35			2
to date , the @entity51 group has developed four electrically powered models , each quite different from the other : a @entity12 sports car ( rear - wheel drive ) , a @entity64 minivan ( front - wheel - drive ) , a @entity59 ( all - wheel - drive ) , and now a @entity62 ( front - wheel - drive )			0
@entity2 promises to offer at least one of these models in 2010 , and three more by 2013			2
@entity68 autos : @entity12 ev photos @entity2 approaches electric vehicles with simple plug - and - play engineering			1
every one of their vehicles uses similar electric drive motors ( only varying in power output ) , advanced lithium - ion batteries , and a power management controller			2
each plugs in to 110 - or 220 - volt household outlets for recharging			0
the @entity2 and both jeeps use an on - board range - extending battery charger ( a generator )			1
this generator automatically turns on after the vehicle 's initial batter charge has been spent ( usually within a range of 40 miles ) , supplying extra voltage that give these three vehicles an estimated range of approximately 400 miles			2
the generator is powered by a small gasoline - powered engine that runs with exceptional efficiency			0
this technology is similar in concept to what @entity99 has shown in their @entity101 , a vehicle that should be ready for production in 2010			0
@entity68 autos : @entity104 photos the @entity12 carries a larger battery pack and no generator , so its range on the charge it carries is approximately 150 - 200 miles			1
its large battery pack combined with compact dimensions and the exceptional torque provided by its electric motor blast the car from zero - to - sixty mph in around four seconds , exceptionally fast for any sports car regardless of engine type			1
@entity3 @entity3 used the 2009 @entity1 to showcase their @entity119 vehicles			1
the @entity3 approach was to develop one efficient body style , and then equip it with three different electric drive packages			1
@entity68 autos : @entity124 photos much of the hardware for the all - electric front - wheel - drive propulsion units is built into what @entity3 calls " sandwich - floor " architecture that the company uses on several production cars			1
the design helps keep heavy components mounted low on the chassis for better handling , enhanced safety , and maximized interior room			0
all three @entity119 vehicles include electric drive and batteries			2
the e-cell uses a large battery pack that is said to deliver a range of 120 miles			1
the @entity145 utilizes a smaller battery pack , but supplements the vehicle 's range with a hydrogen fuel cell			1
the fuel cell produces electricity to recharge the battery pack that extends cruising range to 240 miles			1
the @entity154 , with a range of approximately 360 miles , is the distance champion			0
the key is the on - board generator powered by tiny 1 - liter turbo - charged three - cylinder gasoline engine			0
the engine and generator are located in the rear of the bluezero			0
for the record , when you see photos of these cars together , the @entity142 is lime green , the @entity145 is mint green , and the @entity154 is orange			0
@entity4 adding to its line of popular hybrid vehicles in the @entity18 , @entity4 just confirmed plans to add as many as 10 new gas / electric hybrid vehicles in the next few years			1
on their way toward that goal , @entity4 showed their all - new , third - generation @entity179 plus the new @entity181			2
@entity68 autos : 2010 @entity179 photos important to this story , @entity4 also committed to selling a battery powered electric car in 2012 for the @entity18 market			1
@entity4 debuted what their all - electric vehicle might be at the 2009 @entity1 , and it 's an urban commuter called the @entity192 - @entity35 the little four - seater is based on @entity4 's popular @entity194 , a car that 's already a hit in @entity197			1
the good news is that the @entity194 is a real car , so the @entity200 will not be a glorified golf cart or a neighborhood vehicle with severely limited capabilities			0
the claimed range for the @entity200 is 50 miles			0
as we went to press , details were still sketchy about the @entity200 's running gear			0
as @entity4 releases more details , we 'll bring them to you			2
@entity211 while standard @entity5 models like the @entity213 are comparatively easy on gas compared to larger cars , under the ownership of parent company @entity217 , @entity5 is testing the limits of how green a @entity5 can be			1
@entity68 autos : 2010 @entity221 photos perhaps following the performance of the stunt cars used in @entity224 ( 2003 ) , @entity217 decided to investigate a battery - powered mini			2
they introduced the @entity227 coupe last november at the @entity228 and the car was on display again in @entity40			2
the " charged " @entity227 can run up to 150 miles on a full battery pack			1
charging is accomplished through standard 110 - or 220 - volt outlets			0
the electrified @entity5 weighs 600 pounds more than a standard @entity5 and because of the bulk of the required battery pack , the interior seats only two			1
performance from the 204 - horsepower motor equals the gas - powered @entity5 , with a 0 - 60 mph run in 8.5 seconds			1
@entity217 will produce only 500 @entity241 for the @entity18 ( if it were easy to make electric minis , they 'd make more )			0
the limited - production run will be split between @entity244 and @entity245 on one - year closed - end leases			0
after the leases expire , @entity217 will ship the @entity247 back to @entity248 for evaluation			0
this scenario mimics what @entity99 did with their @entity253 electric vehicle about a decade ago .			0
