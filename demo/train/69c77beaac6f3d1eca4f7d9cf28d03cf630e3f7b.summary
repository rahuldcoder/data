after 14 years of undernourishment and overcrowding , @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 heard the roar of other rescued @entity7 lions wednesday at their spacious new home in @entity10			1
the siblings arrived earlier in the day at the @entity13 , about 30 miles northeast of @entity14 , officials said			1
the lionesses had spent their entire lives in a fairgrounds zoo in @entity18 , outside @entity19			1
the sanctuary helped rescue the lionesses at the behest of the @entity23 government and its @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , said @entity26 , executive director of the sanctuary in @entity28			1
the lionesses , at 200 to 225 pounds , weigh about half of what they should			0
" nobody really took care of them , " @entity26 said			0
" they got no medical attention			0
" non-governmental organizations ran the fairgrounds for years as a way to raise money , @entity26 said			2
the lions usually were housed in a 6 - foot - by - 8 - foot concrete and steel cage in a zoo at the fairgrounds			1
" these three girls did n't have a family structure , " @entity26 said			0
" it was more or less that they were isolated for ( nearly ) 15 years			0
" wednesday afternoon , they were in a 1,500 - square - foot temporary area at the sanctuary			2
" they are in their enclosure , and they are resting comfortably , " according to @entity26			2
" they are enjoying the space			0
" he expects that the lionesses will eventually join a pride of @entity7 lions that were rescued in @entity63			1
" african lions are the only cats that have a strong instinct to live together , " @entity26 said			1
one of the big cats , @entity0 , is named for @entity68 , who actively assists with animal rescues in @entity19			1
on several visits to the zoo , @entity68 noticed the animals had to depend on rain or leftover cleaning water to quench their thirst			2
the carnivores , she said , largely depended on scraps from a slaughterhouse for sustenance			0
zoo visitors often bothered the animals and rattled their cages in the wee hours of the night			2
" it was horrible , " she said			0
@entity68 credits @entity25 with getting the large cats removed from the fairgrounds			1
the zoo also featured gnus , deer , crocodiles and turtles			2
after a protracted legal battle , the zoo was closed , with a mountain lion , two jaguars and an ocelot being temporarily cared for at @entity96 in @entity19			1
@entity97 , a biologist and wildlife technician with @entity25 , said the animals were being kept without proper permits			0
over two weeks , @entity18 hosts one of the biggest fairs in @entity19 , @entity97 said , with school groups visiting the zoo the remainder of the year			1
because groups that sponsored the fair and zoo changed every two years , he said , it was difficult for the government to force organizers to make improvements			2
it 's important for government and animal rights groups to work together , @entity97 said			2
" we need to make alliances			0
" in february , 25 lions rescued from harrowing conditions at circuses in @entity63 were flown to the @entity10 sanctuary , where they live uncaged			1
the flight , part of an @entity125 operation , followed the passage of a @entity63 2009 law that bans the use of any animals in circuses			0
the sanctuary built an 80 - acre fenced site for the @entity63 lions , which are split into four prides , @entity26 said			1
" they all have practically doubled their weight " in the past seven months			0
the 720 - acre sanctuary of rolling grasslands , split into habitats , houses about 300 large carnivores , including bears , tigers and other big cats			1
most of the lions have a lifespan of about 21 to 23 years , double their expected longevity in the wild			0
that 's largely because they have no predators or competition from within their population			0
lionesses receive estrogen implants so they wo n't go into heat			0
that also reduces the competition and fighting among males			0
@entity160 carried the felines from @entity19 to @entity162 , on tuesday and then to @entity14 early wednesday .			1
