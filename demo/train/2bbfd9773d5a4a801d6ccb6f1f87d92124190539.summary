@entity0 -- after months of difficult talks , bipartisan @entity4 and @entity5 negotiators reached a tentative deal on a giant transportation funding bill wednesday , multiple sources tell @entity1			1
a formal announcement is expected late wednesday night after the last details are hammered out and the final language is drafted , they said			1
congressional leaders said they hoped to attach the $ 109 billion highway bill to a measure extending a rate cut on some student loans and legislation reauthorizing national flood insurance and pass them as one bill out of the @entity4 and @entity5 by friday			1
doing so would let @entity21 beat looming deadlines when these measures expire and also would allow lawmakers to escape town for their @entity27 recess			1
passage of the bill , which funds construction for highways , bridges and other transportation projects for two years in every state and congressional district in the nation , would be a significant accomplishment for lawmakers , who have spent much of this session mired in partisan gridlock			1
@entity5 passes huge farm bill aides predicted the final bill would get large bipartisan majorities although some @entity45 are likely to oppose it because they think the measure costs too much			1
both parties had to compromise on core issues			0
republicans dropped language that would have approved the @entity53 pipeline and prevented the @entity54 from regulating harmful coal ash waste from power plants			0
new @entity53 pipeline requires months of review democrats were forced to accept @entity61 demands to streamline and speed up the federal project review process of construction projects			0
republicans said doing so would cut permitting times in half			0
republicans also won reforms that would allow states to opt out of federal mandates to spend highway dollars on bike paths and highway beautification projects			0
doing so , @entity45 said , would allow states to spend more on critical infrastructure projects			0
" i 'm so glad @entity45 met @entity59 half way , as @entity5 @entity45 did months ago , " said sen. @entity78 , @entity79 , the chair of the @entity81 , who said the bill will " protect and create 3 million jobs			2
" " at the end of the day , @entity59 fought for red tape , while @entity87 fought for jobs -- and got some important wins , " said a @entity4 @entity61 leadership aide			0
" this bill is far from perfect , but it is a substantial improvement over the original @entity5 bill			2
" although the agreement includes many of the reforms the @entity4 @entity61 pushed for , it falls far short of the broader transportation and energy bill that @entity4 speaker @entity97 unveiled earlier this year			1
@entity97 : @entity99 contempt vote will proceed @entity97 framed that proposal , which combined road and bridge projects with provisions promoting greater domestic energy production -- such as more drilling in public lands and approval of the @entity53 -- as a major jobs bill			2
but internal @entity61 divisions forced @entity4 @entity61 leaders to pull the measure and it never got a floor vote			2
the energy portions of the bill did pass the @entity4 , but none of those were included in the final bill .			0
