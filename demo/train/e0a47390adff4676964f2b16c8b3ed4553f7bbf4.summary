-- no one wants a @entity3 biopic to be subtle			1
you want the director to don a puffy - sleeved man - blouse and spell out the drama in rhinestones			0
you want the camera to linger on the peacock - feathered pianos , the velveteen '' royal throne '' toilets , and , of course , that white fox - fur coat — the only coat in the world with its own chauffeur			0
and you 'll get all of that in @entity20 's " @entity31 , " which casts @entity22 as the @entity24 legend and @entity25 as his much younger lover @entity29 , whose memoir of their tumultuous five - year relationship inspired the film			1
but there 's less razzle - dazzle here than you 'd expect from a portrait of a camp icon			2
despite the stranger details of their courtship — say , the fact that @entity3 had @entity29 undergo plastic surgery to look more like him , or that he offered to adopt his young paramour — their love feels as banal as any married couple 's , right up until the end , when @entity29 sues @entity3 for palimony			1
the man deserved a sensational , @entity51 - style tribute ; what he got plays more like a @entity55 movie			2
to be clear , there 's still just enough camp gold to get the best lines bedazzled on a leotard			0
( my favorite : '' honey , in gay years , you 're @entity64 during the @entity66 obese period			0
'' ) also , casting @entity67 as @entity3 's drug - pushing , alien - faced plastic surgeon is a genius move that allows the actor to send up his pretty - boy image			1
but @entity22 ' performance is surprisingly restrained , especially given that he 's playing a man who lived in fear every day that his double life would be exposed			1
the more secretive parts of @entity3 's world , like his obsession with sex clubs and porn , come across as quirky rather than dark			1
and @entity25 , who captures @entity29 's damaged - child side well , makes him a little too sympathetic			1
( after all , this is a guy who 's now in jail for burglary			0
) it 's interesting that @entity20 could n't get " candelabra " made as a feature film ; he says it 's because studios feared it was '' too gay			1
'' @entity3 's fans were actually mostly straight women , the older , blue - haired types			1
and for better or worse , that seems like the target audience for this movie , a glossy story of love gone wrong and then ( slightly ) redeemed at the end , without a whole lot of deep pathos in between			0
those ladies might 've been comforted by @entity3 's final words in the movie : '' too much of a good thing is wonderful , '' he says			2
that 's true — but just a little bit more of a bad thing might 've been better			0
grade : b - " @entity31 " will air sunday may 26 on @entity111			2
@entity111 is owned by the parent company of @entity113 and @entity0			0
