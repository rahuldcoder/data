she may have been ill but that did n't stop @entity3 from claiming a 19th grand slam title saturday			1
the world @entity5 beat second - ranked @entity7 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 5 ) in the @entity9 final to move into sole possession of second place in grand slams won in the @entity13 behind @entity14 's 22			1
and on this form , matching @entity14 -- or surpassing the @entity15 -- should n't be discounted even if @entity3 turns 34 in september			1
" i would love to get to 22 , " @entity3 told reporters			2
" but i have to get to 20 first and then i have to get to 21			0
there 's so many wonderful young players coming up , so it will be a very big task			0
" the @entity22 defeated her @entity24 rival for the 16th straight time , although @entity7 ensured it was a gripping contest from start to finish			1
indeed the finale between two of the most recognizable athletes in the world produced some riveting rallies , which has n't always been the case when they 've played due to @entity3 ' superiority			2
" it 's frustrating to be the one going home with the small trophy , " @entity7 told reporters			2
" but i do love the battle			0
" i love high - quality tennis			0
i love being part of it			0
it 's a lot better than watching it on tv			0
" a gutsy @entity7 saved match points in two different games with punishing forehands , both players took turns uttering shouts of " come on " -- @entity3 was penalized in the second set for yelling out in celebration when a point was n't over -- and despite not being fully fit , @entity3 covered the court with aplomb			1
a 12 - minute rain delay in the first set -- during which @entity3 vomited off court -- forced organizers to close the roof on @entity66 and with conditions subsequently perfect for serving , it boosted @entity3 ' already potent delivery			1
" i also started serving better in the second set because i knew if i was n't having my ground strokes where i wanted them to be , i knew i could serve it out , " @entity3 said			2
fifteen of her 18 aces , including one to wrap up the nearly two - hour contest , came in the second			0
" when the games on her serve were 30 - all , 40 - 30 or 15 - 30 a few times , she came up with really great serves , " @entity7 said			1
" there 's a few , just very limited amount of players that serve in that speed range as she does consistently			0
" she finds the corners extremely well			0
" @entity3 , who suffered from a fever and cough all this week , set the tone by breaking in the first game			2
she took control of the first by winning six straight points following the rain delay to build a 5 - 2 advantage			2
but @entity7 , one of the game 's best competitors , did n't melt in the second set			2
she matched and even surpassed @entity96 from the baseline			0
@entity7 saved one match point trailing 5 - 4 and the other at 4 - 6 in the tiebreak after saving two match points in the second round			1
another escape act was n't on the cards , however			0
with @entity3 finally holding match point on her own serve , she thought she hit an ace out wide			0
she reloaded and hit an almost identical serve to see off @entity7			0
the pair have n't always gotten along -- @entity7 's current boyfriend , men 's pro @entity111 , is believed to have formerly dated @entity3 -- but a warm handshake ensued			1
@entity3 maintained her record of never losing past the quarterfinals in @entity116 , improving to 12 - 0			1
besides suffering another defeat to @entity3 , @entity7 failed in her bid for a sixth major and first outside @entity119 in seven years			1
" i have n't beaten her in a really long time but i love every time i step on the court to play against her because she 's been the best and as a tennis player you want to play against the best , " @entity7 said			1
" i was almost down and out in the second round and i feel like i gave myself a second life in this tournament and gave myself an opportunity			0
it was n't quite enough today but i 'm proud of my effort and couple of weeks here			0
" in sunday 's men 's final , top - seed @entity131 faces sixth - seed @entity135			1
like @entity3 , four - time winner @entity131 has never been beaten at @entity136 in a semifinal or final .			1

@entity3 beats @entity7 in the @entity9 final
@entity3 prevails 6 - 3 7 - 6 to beat @entity7 for the 16th straight time
@entity3 wins a 19th major and sixth title at @entity136
