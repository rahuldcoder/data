-- the @entity1 filed a federal lawsuit thursday against @entity3 , @entity4 , a small town north of @entity6			1
officials in @entity3 passed an ordinance in april requiring every head of household to have a gun and ammunition			1
@entity3 's five - member town council unanimously approved the law , which says violators could be fined up to $ 1,000			0
the @entity1 , the legal branch of a long - running @entity18 - based organization of gun control advocates , says that @entity3 's new law in unconstitutional			1
the ordinance exempts people who " suffer from a physical or mental disability , " felons , " paupers " or people who " conscientiously oppose maintaining firearms as a result of beliefs or religious doctrine			0
" the suit says the law violates the @entity33 because requiring people to purchase a firearm when they do n't want to own one violates their freedom of speech and their " freedom to act or not to act			1
" the law violates the 14th amendment because it creates two classes of individuals : heads of households and non-heads of households , the suit says			2
the suit also says the law violates the @entity50 , because that amendment does not require , or permit the government to require , owning a firearm			2
and there are residents of @entity3 who have suffered economically because of the law , the suit says			1
it says longtime resident @entity58 was " forced " to purchase a handgun and ammunition , which cost him nearly $ 700 -- a financial burden he should not have to bear			0

@entity3 's law was modeled on a similar law in nearby @entity71 , @entity4 , a measure that has been on the books since 1982			0
