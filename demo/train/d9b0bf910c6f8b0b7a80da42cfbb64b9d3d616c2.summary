-- a dinosaur from the middle - late @entity3 period , found in @entity4 , gives scientists new understandings of how birds evolved , according to a wednesday report from the journal @entity10			1
the newly discovered species is called @entity12			1
" @entity16 " is @entity13 for " daybreak " or " dawn			2
" @entity17 is @entity18 for " bird			0
" the last part of the name , xui , honors paleontologist @entity22			0
the dinosaur lived about 150 million years ago , said @entity24 , lead author and researcher at the @entity26 in @entity27			2
read about more dinosaur discoveries the critter was 51 centimeters -- about 20 inches -- long			1
it had teeth and probably fed on insects , @entity24 said			0
it was found in the @entity34 of @entity35 , @entity4			1
this dinosaur appears to have had four wings , two along the arms and two along the legs , @entity24 said			2
it could probably glide but not actively fly off the ground			0
the specimen , exceptionally preserved in a clay sediment , appears to be an adult			0
this dinosaur ate like a falcon another fossil from about 150 million years ago , called @entity49 , was previously considered the most primitive known bird			1
@entity24 said the newly discovered dinosaur throws that into question , as the new find appears to represent an even more primitive , older bird			1
@entity56 , assistant professor of anatomical sciences at @entity58 in @entity59 , who was not involved in the study , said in an e-mail that the find was " a very interesting fossil discovery			0
" it demonstrates just how similar the earliest birds were to the earliest members of the dinosaur groups , dromaeosaurids and troodontids , @entity56 said			2
these groups are all theropods , small meat - eating dinosaurs that walked on two feet			0
@entity73 cousins go after crayfish , hook a mastodon because of how well - preserved and well - prepared the specimen is , it provides useful information about the creature 's evolutionary position and the changes that were taking place in the lineage that led to birds , he said			0
still , @entity12 's exact position in its family tree is likely not set in stone , he said			1
the relationships between the earliest bird species and their dinosaur relatives can change in subtle ways depending on the data set being used by particular groups of researchers			1
that means that species that were once called " birds " can become considered " troodontids , " or vice versa			1
the exact details are still being worked out , @entity56 said			0
" that 's why new discoveries like @entity12 are both very exciting and frustrating because they often raise as many questions as they answer , " he said			2
