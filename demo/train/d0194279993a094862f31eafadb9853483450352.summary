ice climber @entity5 thinks of the famous falls as a spot for adventure			1
there have been countless attempts by daredevils to ride down both parts of @entity1 -- the @entity13 on the @entity15 side and @entity16 on the @entity18 side			2
but earlier this week , @entity5 made history when he became the first person to climp up the falls			2
the @entity18 ice climber used only ice hooks to scale the frozen cliffs at @entity24 , a 147 - foot section directly next to @entity16			1
" i checked out the spot we were thinking of climbing in the summer			0
you 'd be swept away by the torrential downpour then , " @entity5 said on @entity29			2
" on a warm winter ( day ) , there 's no climb here			0
" but on a cold , freezing day in late january , the wall of water is a wall of ice -- the icing is so heavy that the area is closed to tourists during the winter months -- a perfect scenario for @entity5			1
he clambered up the frozen walls three times , taking about an hour each trip , according to @entity29			0
@entity5 described the ice as " unstable " because it formed in distinct layers of ice and snow , which made the climb more difficult			1
" that climb beat me up , " he said			0
" i may have reached the top , but @entity52 won the war			0
at the end of the day i was hypothermic			0
" indeed , @entity5 's biggest challenges in the climb seemed to be getting really cold and really wet			1
as he climbed , right next to him 681,750 gallons of water per second surged down @entity16			0
" i was so close to the water , i could reach out and stick my ice tool in the @entity1 , " @entity5 told redbull.com			1
" at one point i was behind the water , climbing on ice that froze behind the falls			0
i got a whole lot of @entity52 down my neck ! " scaling the falls is the latest feat for @entity5 , who was recently named a @entity67			2
he 's also a three - time gold medalist at the @entity69 and won the @entity70 , according to his website			1
