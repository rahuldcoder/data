-- the @entity3 army stole at least 333 children and sold them for adoption in other countries during the @entity9 nation 's 36 - year civil war , a government report has concluded			1
around 45,000 people are believed to have disappeared during @entity3 's civil war , 5,000 of them children			1
many of those children ended up in the @entity15 , as well as @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , said the report 's author and lead investigator , @entity22			1
in some cases , the report said , parents were killed so the children could be taken and given to government - operated agencies to be adopted abroad			1
in other instances , the children were abducted without physical harm to the parents			1
" this was a great abuse by the state , " @entity22 told @entity0 on friday			0
investigators started examining records in may 2008 for a period that spanned from 1977 - 89 , said @entity22 , the director of the @entity38 , a commission established by president @entity39			1
of 672 records investigators looked at , @entity22 said , they determined that 333 children had been stolen			1
the children were taken for financial and political reasons , he said			1
@entity22 acknowledges that many more children possibly were taken			1
investigators zeroed in on the 1977 - 89 period because peak adoptions occurred during that time frame , particularly in 1986			1
they will investigate through 1995 and hope to have another report ready by early next year , he said			2
a presidential ministry has determined that about 45,000 people disappeared during the nation 's civil war , which lasted from 1960 to 1996			0
about 5,000 of those were children , the ministry said			2
another 200,000 people died in the conflict between the leftist guerrillas and right - wing governments			0
the nation 's public ministry and attorney general 's office will determine whether anyone is prosecuted over the abductions , @entity22 said			0
asked if he would like to see prosecutions , @entity22 answered , " i hope so			0
" @entity22 said he has attended several reunions of abducted children -- now adults -- and family members			2
" i ca n't tell you how happy that makes me , " he said			0
adoption has served as a source of income in @entity3 for decades			2
the war just made it easier for abuses at the hands of soldiers to occur			2
@entity3 has the world 's highest per capita rate of adoption and is one of the leading providers of adoptive children for the @entity15			1
nearly one in 100 babies born in @entity3 end up with adoptive parents in the @entity15 , according to the @entity15 consulate in @entity3			1
adoptions can cost up to $ 30,000 , providing a large financial incentive in a country where the @entity91 says about 75 percent of the people live below the poverty level			0
officials fear that often times mothers are paid -- or coerced -- into giving up their children			2
some unscrupulous lawyers and notaries , who have greater power in @entity3 than they do in the @entity15 , have taken advantage of the extreme poverty and limited government oversight over adoptions to enrich themselves			1
@entity22 said corrupt lawyers and notaries were the driving force behind many of the army abductions of children			2
the problem is confounded because many @entity3 parents ca n't provide for their children			1
the @entity112 ' @entity111 says @entity3 has the fourth highest rate of chronic malnutrition in the world and the highest in @entity116 and the @entity117			0
chronic undernutrition affects about half of the nation 's children under the age of 5 , the @entity112 agency said			0
@entity3 president @entity39 declared a state of national calamity this week because so many citizens do not have food or proper nutrition			0
despite the nation 's problems , @entity22 hopes some good will come of the report , which was released thursday			0
" we have to tell the truth about what happened , " he said			0
" @entity3 society must know what happened and must never allow it to happen again			0
" @entity0 's @entity138 contributed to this report			0
