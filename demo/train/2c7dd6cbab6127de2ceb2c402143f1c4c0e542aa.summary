-- @entity1 will surely be popping open the champagne as her new romantic comedy , " @entity4 , " accepted the top spot at the box office this weekend by grossing $ 34.1 million , according to early estimates by @entity8			1
@entity9 and @entity1 have reason to celebrate after " the proposal " takes top box office spot			1
not only did " @entity4 " win the weekend , but it was by far the best opening of @entity1 's career , nearly doubling the opening of her previous best , " @entity17 , " which debuted to $ 17.6 million in 2007			1
while " the proposal 's " success was fueled mostly by women ( 73 percent of the audience was female ) , both women and men gave it a healthy " a- " @entity26 rating , so expect the movie to hold up fairly well during the next few weeks			0
the weekend 's other big release , the prehistoric buddy comedy " @entity31 , " landed in fourth place with $ 20.2 million -- an okay debut for the $ 60 million movie			1
however , all indicators point to a quick descent for the @entity39 / @entity38 flick			0
" @entity31 " dropped 24 percent from friday to saturday ( never a reassuring sign ) , and the movie received an unimpressive " b - " rating from @entity26			0
" @entity31 " is all but certain to join " @entity45 " as another box - office disappointment for high - concept comedies			2
on the other hand , " @entity48 " ( no. 2 with $ 26.9 million ) and " @entity49 " ( no. 3 with $ 21.3 million ) continued to show off their box - office stamina , dropping only 18 percent and 31 percent , respectively , from the prior weekend			1
" @entity49 " now stands at $ 224 million , and may levitate past " @entity50 " ( currently at $ 239 million ) to become the year 's highest - grossing film			2
finishing off the top five was " the taking of @entity53 1 2 3 , " which fell an alarming 52 percent for an $ 11.3 million weekend stash			2
also opening this weekend was @entity56 's " @entity55 , " starring @entity57			2
the @entity59 - based comedy laughed up $ 281,000 from just nine theaters for a weekend - leading $ 31,000 gross per theater			0
the film will expand to more than 300 theaters on july 3			0
overall , the box office was up 3 percent compared to last year 's @entity65 weekend , when " @entity66 " debuted to a surprisingly sharp $ 38.7 million			1
hope you all are having a splendid @entity65 ! i know i will -- i 'm taking my pop to see " @entity49			0
