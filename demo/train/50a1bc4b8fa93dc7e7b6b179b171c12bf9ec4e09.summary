-- can crowdfunding help an iconic team return to the @entity3 grid after a 20 - year hiatus ? that 's the aim for the family of the late three - time world champion sir @entity7 , whose eponymous team still roars with resonance through motorsport history			1
in 1966 , the @entity11 conjured a unique feat in @entity3 history when , at the age of 40 , he became the only man to win the driver and team world titles with a car of his own make			1
all in all , the @entity7 team engineered two constructor titles and four driver crowns -- with @entity7 in 1967 , @entity24 in 1968 and @entity25 in 1981 and 1983 -- and was owned by @entity3 chief @entity26 for much of the 1970s and 1980s			1
inspired by sir @entity7 's ingenuity and get - up - and - go attitude , his family have now launched @entity32			1
its first aim is simple -- to bring the famous marque back to motorsport for the first time since 1992 with the help of its fans			1
" @entity7 sits alongside @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 because of what dad achieved , " @entity41 , sir @entity7 's youngest son , tells @entity0			1
" if you look at the history and heritage and what it means to people , a @entity7 should really be out there -- racing is in our dna			2
" @entity32 is relying on this affection for the @entity7 brand as it seeks to raise an initial $ 400,000 through crowdfunding			1
donations start at just $ 1.60 and climb to $ 16,000 for a vip experience , which includes a one - on - one on - track driving lesson from former @entity3 racer @entity41			2
" @entity64 is definitely a new and exciting way of generating funds " he says			0
" it gives us the seed money to get the project up and running but it also gives people an avenue to start being involved in the team			1
" @entity64 makes it easier for smaller companies and start - ups to raise capital by reaching potential new investors via online platforms			0
a quick cash injection would be a lifeline for struggling @entity3 teams @entity82 and @entity83			2
it was reported at the weekend that both teams will not race in the upcoming @entity86 and @entity88 @entity87 because of a lack of funds			0
could crowdfunding be the answer to ensuring independent race teams -- which operate without the financial clout of major brands such as @entity95 , @entity42 and @entity96 -- stay on the grid ? " @entity3 teams spend a hell of a lot of money trying to succeed and we know there are a lot of teams in trouble financially just trying to survive , " says @entity7			1
" i think that 's more to do with the model and how they go about their business in that environment			0
you have to make sure that the model you 're selling is sustainable			0
" @entity32 is using a different model because if we went down the same road as everyone else we 'd have the same problems			2
" we 've already got commercial partners coming to talk to us because they can see the benefits of this different model			0
" radical ideas @entity32 also aims to give as well as receive			1
the second radical ethos of the scheme is to lay bare the workings of a race team for the benefit of fans and future motorsport professionals alike			2
" do you start up a race team like everyone else or do you go racing in a different way and show what we 're doing and how we 're doing it ? " asks @entity7			1
" we 're setting out to give the fans access as well as educating drivers and engineers because you learn so much in this environment			0
" it opens up any sort of problems that people have , instead of hiding stuff			0
i 've been involved in teams where a lot of politics has got in the way of success			0
" being open and transparent does n't exist [ in motorsport ] but i think it will give us an advantage			0
" we 're already communicating with our followers , we are already asking them , ' what do you think about this , what do you think about that			0
' " we want to hear what they 've got to say and they already feel like they are part of the team development			0
" the first phase of @entity32 is to raise enough capital to run a @entity7 team in the @entity169 for sports cars in 2015			1
the crowdfunding target is set at an initial $ 400,000 but for @entity7 to find a factory and buy its first car it has a more realistic goal of $ 4 million in mind			2
a return to @entity3 -- where teams can spend $ 1 million a day -- for @entity7 after a 22 - year hiatus may seem like a pipedream , but not for the determined @entity7 family			1
" our ultimate goal is to get the @entity7 name back in @entity3 , " @entity41 explains			1
" it 's in our dna and it 's where @entity7 really should be , but it 's one step at a time			2
" our model would n't work in @entity3 in an open and transparent way now , but 10 years down the road it could be a completely different story and , if it is , we want to be back in @entity3			2
" a new generation it is not only the @entity7 team that could be back on the grid -- sir @entity7 's 20 - year - old grandsons @entity197 and @entity198 are also out to put the famous @entity7 name back in the driving seat			1
@entity198 is the 2013 champion in the @entity202 open - wheeled championship and a reserve driver for 1978 @entity3 champion @entity205 's team in the @entity207 championship , while @entity197 races in @entity209 in the @entity210			1
" we have n't raced each other , " says @entity198 of the pair 's budding rivalry			0
" but whether it be putting pillow cases on pillows or playing basketball , i always try and beat him			0
i ca n't lose to him ! " @entity197 agrees , adding : " yeah , competition runs in the family at absolutely anything ! " but do the third generation of @entity226 racers -- who are following their fathers , uncle and grandfather onto the racetrack -- feel any pressure ? " it 's more of an honor and something i take pride in , " says @entity197			0
@entity198 adds : " if anything maybe there 's less pressure as our family understand how racing works and how much pressure drivers put on themselves			0
" maybe there is pressure from the family name and trying to live up to expectations but i just see my grandfather as my grandfather and my dad as my dad , so i do n't see it that way			0
" with the ambitions of @entity32 and a third generation of racing talent , is there a chance we could one day see a @entity7 racing a @entity7 in @entity3 ? " the goal is to eventually have @entity7 back in @entity3 , " says @entity197 with a smile			1
" i think that would be massive , i think people would take to it -- and we 've got two drivers here who would n't mind doing it as well ! "			0
