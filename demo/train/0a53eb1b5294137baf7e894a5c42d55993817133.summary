-- i must have met @entity2 , as we called @entity4 , way before i remember			1
we often attended readings , but the first time she absolutely caught my attention was at @entity9 in @entity10			2
it was n't all that cold , but @entity4 and others had fur coats on			1
my mother , who was a big fan of the @entity16 colleges , had come with me			2
we both had on cloth coats			2
@entity2 , as we all know , was 6 feet or taller			2
mommy was 4 - foot - 11 , and i am 5 - foot - 2			2
not only were we shorter , we felt smaller			2
i looked at that group and made a silent vow to never allow my mother to be with this group again without a fur coat			2
we purchased one soon after			2
when @entity18 died , i shared that story with @entity24 @entity4 laughed			1
" we had no idea , " she said			0
mommy owes @entity24 opinion : @entity4 : the definition of a phenomenal woman when @entity2 moved to @entity30 , @entity31 , she was not far from me in @entity33 , so i got to see a lot of her			1
if i had any inkling she was frying chicken , i 'd go down and spend the night			0
when @entity39 sent her a case of wonderfully expensive champagne , those days i had to spend the night ! everyone came to @entity2 's place , which was great fun			1
you 'd wake up in the morning not knowing who would be down to breakfast			0
the superstars ; the wonderfully funny ; old friends from another country ; a congressman			0
and @entity2 treated them all the same			0
@entity4 remembered by those she inspired her ability to speak to everyone in the same voice was what made her the force she was			1
our only disagreements were about food			0
she was a great cook , and i think of myself as a good one			1
we were arguing about rack of lamb , one of my specialties			0
my recipe comes from the late , great country cook @entity67			1
i went home after my visit and decided i should not just talk the talk but also walk the walk			0
i called my good friend @entity72 from @entity73 to have her come with me to @entity2 's to cook			1
@entity74 is a great cook , too			1
we got on @entity2 's calendar , packed all our ingredients and spices and boogied on down			1
@entity2 sat at the head of the table , where she could see everything going on in the kitchen			0
she inspected the lamb , checked the veggies , tasted everything and praised @entity72			0
i think she loved me a little bit because she , like my only living aunt , always felt free to make minor corrections			0
" i think the lamb is a bit overdone , " she offered			0
" well @entity67 is in heaven , and i checked with her before i put this on the table , " i responded			0
i know if the lamb was not done properly , she would have eaten it and not said a word			0
i wanted to fry chicken for her , too , but time just ran out			0
our mutual friend , the late author @entity103 , always said , " find the good and praise it			1
" @entity4 took it to heart			1
she would always seek the good in any situation , or she avoided the question			1
opinion : how @entity4 gave me life in all my years of knowing her , i only heard her once speak ill of someone and that was well deserved			1
like everyone , i have read and reread " @entity115			0
" and like that caged bird , @entity4 sought an inner freedom			1
we only have to look at her life to see that she took every ounce of joy life had to offer			0
i will remember her as a courageous woman who always wanted to love , and wish her a rightful place in literature			0
some of @entity4 's most powerful speeches the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity128 .			1

poet @entity128 knew @entity4 over the years and shares her memories
