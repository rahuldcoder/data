-- president @entity1 on monday strongly praised a decision by the nation 's pharmaceutical industry to agree to a deal cutting drug costs for elderly @entity6 , calling it an example of the kind of compromise required for successful national health care reform			1
president @entity1 says the pharmaceutical industry announcement " marks a major step forward			2
" the agreement discounts medications for @entity16 beneficiaries facing high out - of - pocket expenses when their benefits reach a gap in coverage			1
" this is a significant breakthrough on the road to health care reform , one that will make the difference in the lives of many older @entity6 , " @entity1 said at the @entity21			1
" today marks a major step forward , but it will only be meaningful if we complete the journey			0
... i have to repeat and revive an old saying we had from the campaign : yes , we can			0
we are going to get this done			0
" the nation 's top drug manufacturers agreed over the weekend to at least a 50 percent discount for most beneficiaries for brand - name medicines purchased in the so - called " doughnut hole " gap in coverage , @entity1 noted			1
the gap involves medication costs of senior citizens between roughly $ 2,700 and $ 6,100 a year that are not covered by the @entity49 plan			1
the deal will be part of an $ 80 billion reduction in @entity16 drug costs for senior citizens over the next 10 years , according to @entity56 chairman @entity55 , @entity57 , who helped negotiate the agreement			1
part of that $ 80 billion will go to closing the @entity16 prescription drug " doughnut hole			1
" congressional staffers did not have precise estimates , but @entity56 spokesman @entity64 said they expect the $ 80 billion commitment to both cover the @entity16 drug gap and leave additional money for other , still unannounced , programs			1
the @entity70 , the nation 's largest organization of senior citizens , has praised the pharmaceutical industry agreement as a step toward health care reform			1
@entity1 spokesman @entity76 noted monday that @entity70 was opposed to health care reform during the first term of former president @entity78 in the early 1990s			1
" you 've got the pharmaceutical industry and the largest group representing seniors in this country , who 16 years ago were n't at the table but were on the other side of the political debate , " @entity76 said of groups expressing support monday for health care reform			2
" i think that represents progress and important steps towards real reform			0
" overhauling health care is a top priority of @entity1 's administration , but the initial proposals to reach @entity97 last week received a rocky reception			1
the @entity99 determined that either of two similar bills written by @entity102 would cost more than $ 1 trillion , which was higher than expected			0
@entity104 opponents immediately slammed the measures , and the @entity56 delayed scheduled hearings on one of the bills			0
hearings by the @entity110 on the other measure began amid intense partisan bickering , with hundreds of amendments proposed by @entity104 opponents			0
at least two more bills are expected from the @entity115 , and a bipartisan group led by former @entity56 majority leaders @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 also has offered guidelines for a proposal			0
at issue is how best to reduce the cost and increase the reach of the current health care system , which officials say is increasingly draining personal , corporate and government budgets while leaving 46 million @entity6 without health insurance			2
@entity1 has warned that a failure to act soon will bring far worse economic difficulties than the costs of plans under discussion			2
both parties in @entity97 agree on the need to slow the increase in health care costs while ensuring that all @entity6 can get health insurance , but they differ sharply on how to proceed			2
democrats generally favor a government - funded " public option " to compete with private insurers			0
@entity104 have said such a step would lead to a government takeover of health care , which they oppose			0
republicans also accuse @entity1 and @entity102 of trying to rush through what they say is flawed legislation in 2009 before the politics of midterm elections in 2010 and the 2012 presidential race			0
the parties do appear to agree on several broad principles , however , including an emphasis on preventive care , cost - cutting measures in the existing @entity16 and @entity160 programs , and a halt to denials of coverage because of pre-existing medical conditions			2
@entity0 's @entity165 contributed to this report .			0
