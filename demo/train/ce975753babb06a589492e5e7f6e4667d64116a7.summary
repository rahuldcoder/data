-- @entity2 's social network @entity3 will be gone in the next release of @entity5 , reports @entity6 , citing sources close to the company			1
@entity2 ceo @entity9 hinted that @entity2 has all but given up on @entity3 in may , though he did n't precisely say whether @entity2 will kill the service			2
" we tried @entity3 , and i think the customer voted and said this is n't something i want to put a lot of energy into , " said @entity9			0
unlike @entity2 's hardware and software products , most of which have been tremendously successful in the last couple of years , the company 's social network has been poorly received from the very beginning			1
besides the fact it was available only to a limited subset of @entity5 users , it also had issues with spam and a serious lack of artist profiles			2
with the announced @entity35 integration with @entity36 , which is now almost an integral part of the os ( just like @entity38 ) , it makes sense that @entity2 is no longer interested in maintaining @entity3			0
