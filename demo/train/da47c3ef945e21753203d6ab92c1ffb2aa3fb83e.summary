former @entity1 sen. @entity0 is running as the " authentic conservative " in the @entity4 primaries			1
as his campaign has gained steam moving into the @entity10 and @entity11 contests , the entire tenor of the @entity4 debate has changed dramatically			1
social and cultural issues are front and center once again			2
whereas candidates had spent months railing against president @entity16 as a big - government liberal and talking about the weak economy and deficits , over the past two weeks they have plunged back into the culture wars , making provocative statements about contraception , religion , gender relations and more			1
in response to media reports about @entity0 's comments in 2008 , in which he said , " @entity30 is attacking the great institutions of @entity32 , " @entity0 responded , " i will defend everything i say			1
" @entity0 's hope is that social conservatism can offer the path toward a @entity4 victory , by highlighting a set of issues that can bring the conservative coalition together			1
as former @entity42 gov. @entity41 continues to be pummeled for his flip - flopping on key issues , his wealth , and his background in the private sector , @entity0 hopes that he can create a bridge between the @entity4 right and disaffected blue - collar workers -- the so - called @entity51 -- through social issues that cut across class lines			1
the strategy plays into a conventional argument about how @entity4 can succeed with voters whose economic interests are better served by the @entity51 , namely through focusing on social and cultural issues that shift attention in a different direction			1
this is a risky bet for the @entity4 and a positive development for the administration and congressional democrats			2
while most successful @entity4 presidential candidates have paid lip service to social conservatism in the last three decades , the truth is it has never been an issue through which @entity4 have been able to build successful coalitions that can win at the polls and get bills passed			1
currently , polls show that the public is not in favor of many of the positions espoused by the right when it comes to culture			0
according to a poll by @entity81 and the @entity82 , 66 % supported the administration 's plan to require private health insurance to cover birth control and 61 % said yes with regard to religiously affiliated employers ; @entity89 supported the administration 61 % to 31 %			0
in 2011 , @entity91 found that a majority of @entity32 supported the legalization of same - sex marriage			0
a number of factors other than social conservatism have been responsible for propelling republicans into the @entity99			0
in some cases , @entity4 have been able to build broad coalitions when the economy is growing and some of the economic tensions that might otherwise play to the policies of @entity51 are muted			2
in 1984 , for example , president @entity106 could boast that it was " morning in @entity32 " again as the impact of the recession was diminishing			0
in 2000 , the continued strength of the high - tech economy allowed @entity114 gov. @entity113 to include economic policies that would benefit the wealthy -- such as a regressive tax cut -- within an agenda of compassionate conservatism that would assist marginalized @entity32			0
the other way in which @entity4 candidates have been able to expand their electoral coalition is through appeals based on national security			2
claiming that @entity4 are tougher on defense has been a way to attract voters whose economic interests fit more easily with the policies of @entity51			2
president @entity128 did this in 1988 with a devastating campaign that portrayed @entity42 gov. @entity131 as a timid liberal who would not stand up to the @entity133			0
in 2004 , his son used similar tactics to portray sen. @entity136 as a @entity138 - protesting vet who would not take the needed steps to defeat terrorism			0
in 1980 , aided by a weakened economy , @entity106 attacked president @entity142 as impotent and ineffective overseas			0
the former @entity144 governor used the @entity146 hostage crisis and the @entity133 invasion of @entity148 as evidence that republicans were needed to revive @entity32 's international standing			0
while all of these @entity4 certainly paid lip service to social conservatism , those issues were always a limited part of their campaigns and even less important once @entity4 were in power			1
in this election , @entity4 will probably not have any of the other factors that have been so pivotal			0
if the economy is stronger , one of their central critiques about @entity16 will not be nearly as effective			0
without a major national security crisis -- and after @entity16 undercut some of the hawkish clamor of the @entity4 with the killing of @entity168 and several other key figures in @entity170 -- republicans wo n't have national security to hold them together again			1
@entity0 and his supporters think that social conservatism is the answer			2
the other @entity4 candidates , seeking to steal his thunder , have joined the move rightward in recent days			1
the president could not ask for much more , as he and his advisers watch the @entity4 primaries disintegrate into a @entity4 civil war			2
@entity4 are refocusing the national debate on a set of questions that has little track record as a winning theme , and they have effectively moved the debate away from the president and his vulnerabilities and toward questions about whether the @entity4 is too extreme			1
for @entity16 , it might actually be morning in @entity32 again .			0

@entity194 : @entity0 's rise in the polls has changed nature of @entity4 race
he says the race has focused more *heavily* on social issues in recent weeks
social issues have n't been a winning formula for @entity4 presidential candidates , he says
@entity194 : the rightward turn of the @entity4 race is good news for president @entity16
