editor 's note : @entity2 is one of the few @entity4 journalists reporting from @entity5 after the @entity7 government placed restrictions on coverage			1
a man in the crowd holds up a photo of @entity13 during @entity15 's address at friday prayers			1
@entity5 , @entity7 ( @entity17 ) -- people in the crowd sang songs of tribute as they waited			1
when he arrived , they stood and welcomed him in unison : " praise be to @entity24 and to his prophet , @entity25			1
" ayatollah @entity15 , @entity7 's supreme leader for two decades , took the stage during friday prayers at @entity28 with a few notes on small pieces of paper in his left hand			1
he leaned on the lectern with his right arm , crippled in an 1981 assassination attempt			1
he was ready to put an end to a week of unrest			2
@entity38 , a sermon about the dangers of division and disunity , using the language of @entity44			1
then came secular sentences , decidedly direct			2
he praised the huge turnout at the polls as a victory for @entity7 but criticized post-election turmoil as the work of @entity7 's enemies -- the @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
" the enemies want to destroy our confidence			2
they want to create doubt about the election , " @entity15 said			1
a full hour passed before he delivered a verdict that supporters of opposition presidential candidate @entity63 did not want to hear			2
" eleven million votes difference ? " he asked			2
" sometimes there 's a margin of one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand , or one million , maximum			2
then one can doubt , be concerned that there has been some rigging or manipulation			2
" but there 's a difference of 11 million votes			0
how can vote rigging happen ? " to be clear , he reminded the crowd of the victor at the polls			0
it was the man sitting in the front row : @entity7 president @entity13			1
he was the " the absolute victor , " @entity15 said			1
" if political elites want to ignore or break the law and willy - nilly take wrong measures which are harmful , they will be held accountable for all violence and blood and rioting			0
" few in the crowd were disappointed with the cleric 's words			0
" death to @entity53 ! " the people chanted repeatedly , interrupting @entity15 's speech			1
" noticeably absent friday was @entity63 , the man who had sparked @entity7 's unrest by calling for a recount of the votes			0
absent , too , were @entity63 's supporters , who did not take to the streets to protest as they had done in previous days			0
there were no signs and placards on the streets			0
or people clamoring for change			0
the tens of thousands who showed up for friday prayer were a stark contrast to the demonstrators			0
they were mostly religious conservatives , supporters of @entity13			1
and they had a message for the president 's opponent , though it was not always consistent			0
" the nation should come together , " one said			0
" we are all one			0
" others took a hard line : " they must stop with the demonstrations , otherwise there will be consequences			0
" just what those consequences might be may become apparent saturday afternoon , when the demonstrators are expected again on the streets of @entity5			0
but for now , @entity7 's supreme leader had issued his warning clearly : enough is enough .			1

supreme leader sermonizes about dangers of division and disunity
@entity15 : post-election turmoil the work of the @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55
