@entity0 has an unlikely new public health hero : a giant , anthropomorphic stool that chases people to squat in toilets			1
mr @entity6 , who appears in commercials accompanied by a groovy techno anthem , is the face of the latest public health campaign by @entity11 in the country			1
with a bold and quirky approach unlike any previous awareness drives , the ' @entity14 ' campaign seeks to bring people 's attention to the health hazards associated with public defecation -- a deep - rooted social norm in the country 's rural and urban slums according to @entity11 , @entity0 has the highest number of people in the world -- an estimated 620 million -- who defecate in the open , creating a major public health hazard by leaving an estimated 65 million kilograms of waste each day			1
only half of the population uses toilets			0
with an animated video , a catchy song with ' toilet sounds ' , and even a smartphone application , the digitally - led campaign is targeted at the country 's youth			1
the campaign uses " quirky , informative and inspiring language , " said @entity11 spokeswoman @entity42			1
" it also contains humour to better connect with the target audience			0
once they [ the youth ] are exposed to the issue ... they will be encouraged to know more			0
" poo woes the approach might be humorous , but the underlying issue is n't			0
open defecation is almost universal amongst the poorest 20 percent of @entity0 's population			1
an absence of adequate toilets and water facilities is as much the reason for this as is a lack of awareness about proper sanitation and hygiene			0
the number of toilets in the country is far below what is required , but even when community toilets are provided , many people in rural @entity0 continue to defecate in the open due to a lack of education about proper hygiene			1
projects such as the @entity75 -- a community - led program launched in 1999 to address the country 's sanitation woes -- have boosted toilet facilities , but hundreds of millions of people remain without access to toilets			2
there is also a huge discrepancy between the government 's data on the number of toilets built and what some reports claim			2
the @entity91 claims that more than 50 percent of the country 's rural households were covered by the sanitation drive by 2010 , while the last @entity96 conducted in 2011 showed toilet coverage to be only around 30 percent			0
children most at risk this is of particular concern for children in the country 's rural pockets			2
reports say poor sanitation is one of the major contributors to @entity0 's rampant child malnutrition numbers -- among the highest in the world			2
@entity11 's figures show why			1
more than 28 million children lack access to toilets in their schools			1
they also face a huge risk of contracting bacterial infections , with over 44 percent of mothers disposing their children 's waste in the open			1
diarrhoea remains one of the top causes of child deaths in the country , alongside respiratory infections			0
the issue of poor sanitation has also been raised by politicians as a priority for the next government			0
" whoever the prime minister is must lead a national movement to make the country open defecation - free in 10 years ' time , " union minister @entity132 told reporters in march			2
the goal seems somewhat ambitious			0
while there has been a 20 percent drop in the number of people defecating in the open in the last decade , @entity0 has a long way to go before it can meet the 2015 @entity147 target for sanitation , which requires 75 % of the country to have access to sanitation			1
@entity0 set itself the even loftier target of providing 100 % of the rural population with access to toilet facilities by 2012 , but that did n't materialize			2
in fact , the date keeps getting pushed further -- it was initially revised to 2015 and recently set back to 2022			0
using social media , @entity11 is trying to steer people 's attention towards this largely taboo issue			2
however , questions remain about the impact of such an urban campaign , given that its target audience -- youngsters -- are mostly likely to be using toilets in any case			0
to which , @entity42 contends , " if we keep silence , we are contributing to the problem			0
so the campaign tries to create noise so those who have actually toilets understand the issue and do something about it			0
