@entity0 -- it was a speech that @entity5 -- a war - stopping , @entity4 - winning president -- never wanted to give			1
a year after he pulled back from threatened military attacks on @entity8 over chemical weapons , @entity5 told @entity10 he now would launch airstrikes against @entity13 targets in the country wracked by civil war			1
the nationally televised address on wednesday night , which lasted less than 15 minutes , promised far - reaching impact that could embroil the nation in another @entity20 conflict			1
" this was a very difficult speech for him , " @entity1 chief political analyst @entity21 said of a president who campaigned on ending wars in @entity24 and @entity25			1
" he 's inserted us into the middle of a @entity8 civil war			2
" 5 takeaways from @entity5 's @entity13 speech " tremendous turnaround " the plan to " dismantle and ultimately destroy " the @entity38 jihadists who have taunted @entity10 by beheading two captive @entity10 journalists calls for what @entity1 chief national security correspondent @entity40 described as a " tremendous turnaround " in @entity5 's previous policies in the region			1
after previously rejecting calls from top advisers to arm and train some of the @entity8 rebels fighting president @entity48 and @entity13 , @entity5 now seeks specific congressional approval to do so			1
he also threatened airstrikes on @entity13 targets in a major expansion of a campaign in @entity24 previously limited to protecting @entity10 advisers working with @entity24 forces and preventing the slaughter of minority groups by the extremists also known as @entity13 and the @entity59			1
" i have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country , wherever they are , " @entity5 said			2
" that means i will not hesitate to take action against @entity13 in @entity8 , as well as @entity24			1
this is a core principle of my presidency : if you threaten @entity10 , you will find no safe haven			0
" in addition , 475 more @entity10 military advisers are headed to @entity24 , raising the total of @entity10 forces there to 1,700 for a mission originally described as limited			1
mission creep " this is mission creep , " @entity40 said			2
the broad campaign against the @entity13 extremists who have rampaged from @entity8 across northern @entity24 includes building an international coalition to support @entity24 ground forces and perhaps troops from other allies			1
it answered calls from a growing number of @entity10 politicians for such a step , with increasing public support for expanded airstrikes against @entity13 targets			2
at the same time , @entity5 made clear the strategy differed from all - out war again in @entity24 less than three years after he withdrew combat forces from the country			2
" it will not involve @entity10 combat troops fighting on foreign soil , " @entity5 said			0
noting the formation of a new @entity24 government , which his administration has demanded , @entity5 announced that " @entity10 will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat			2
" did @entity5 sell his @entity13 strategy ? objective : " degrade and ultimately destroy " @entity13 " our objective is clear : we will degrade , and ultimately destroy , @entity13 through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy , " he said			2
senior administration officials who briefed reporters before the speech on condition of not being identified said airstrikes against @entity13 targets in @entity8 would occur " at a time and place of our choosing			1
" " we 're not going to telegraph our punches by being specific about the time and nature of the targets , " one official said , adding that " we will do that as necessary as we develop targets			0
" also wednesday , @entity5 shifted $ 25 million in military aid to @entity24 forces , including @entity127 fighters in the north combating the @entity13 extremists			1
the aid could include ammunition , small arms and vehicles , as well as military education and training , @entity131 spokeswoman @entity130 said			0
@entity10 diplomatic efforts this week seek to solidify the coalition			0
secretary of state @entity140 left tuesday to push @entity38 leaders in @entity142 and @entity143 to join the @entity10 and its allies in combating @entity13 , while defense secretary @entity145 and @entity146 , the homeland security adviser , also will be in the region			0
@entity143 part of coalition " the @entity143 made very clear that they support this mission , they will join us in this mission , " a senior administration official said			0
" we are joined by very important @entity157 partners as well			0
" @entity5 has been criticized by conservatives and some democrats for what they call a timid response so far to the threat by @entity13 fighters			2
the videotaped beheadings of journalists @entity165 and @entity167 by @entity13 raised public awareness of the extremists and the threat they pose			0
" we ca n't erase every trace of evil from the world , and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm			0
that was the case before 9/11 , and that remains true today , " @entity5 said in depicting @entity13 as a threat to the @entity20 , including the people of @entity24 and @entity8 , rather than the @entity10 homeland			1
" if left unchecked , " he added , " these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region , including to the @entity10			0
" conservative republicans who have railed against @entity5 's foreign policy sounded relieved by what they heard			2
@entity8 opposition groups , which have been battling the terror group , welcomed @entity5 's speech			1
" airstrikes on @entity13 strongholds in @entity8 are a much needed element to degrade the extremist group 's capabilities , " said @entity193 , president of the @entity194			1
he said training opposition fighters on the ground will boost the effectiveness of the airstrikes			0
" we therefore welcome the commitment to intensify the train and equip program to enable the @entity209 , to eradicate @entity13 and other forms of terror in @entity8 , including the ( president @entity48 ) @entity214 regime , " @entity193 said in a statement			1
@entity215 says @entity5 is facing reality " the president 's plan announced this evening is an encouraging step in the right direction , " said @entity215 rep. @entity217 , who chairs the @entity218 and has been a harsh @entity5 critic			2
" @entity224 will depend on the details of its implementation			0
" his @entity215 colleague , rep. @entity228 of @entity229 , said : " tonight the president seemed to have faced reality			0
" leading @entity232 such as sen. @entity233 of @entity234 and sen. @entity235 of @entity236 praised the speech , as expected , while sen. @entity238 of @entity239 said the @entity240 he chairs would begin drafting legislation to provide @entity5 with specific authority under the @entity243 to continue to extend military operations against @entity13			1
meanwhile , the anti-war liberal caucus in the @entity218 signaled possible opposition by calling for a vote on authorizing expanded military action			0
congressional authority @entity5 has insisted he has the authority to ratchet up airstrikes against @entity13 under war powers granted more than a decade ago to fight @entity253			1
@entity13 formed from some @entity253 affiliates but is separate from the central leadership of the terrorist organization behind the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity10			0
@entity5 to @entity258 : no vote needed on @entity13 strategy this week , @entity5 asked @entity258 for additional authority to arm and train moderate @entity8 rebels to fight the @entity13 extremists , effectively shifting a covert operation by the @entity265 to a mission led by the @entity267			1
such authority comes under @entity269 of the @entity10 code , which deals with military powers , and @entity258 could vote on granting it next week			0
@entity272 also would allow the @entity10 to accept money from other countries for backing the @entity8 opposition forces			0
most voices in @entity258 back strong @entity10 action against the @entity13 fighters			0
however , any vote on military action can be risky , especially with congressional elections less than two months off			0
@entity1 's @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity288 and @entity289 contributed to this report .			1
