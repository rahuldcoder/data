-- her surname means " fighter " or " warrior " -- and @entity5 has done her best to fulfill that prophecy throughout a stellar running career of glorious peaks and painful troughs			1
she has battled back from heartbreaking injuries and a controversial ban for missing drugs tests to become the first @entity14 woman to win 400 meters gold at both the @entity16 and the world championships			1
the @entity18 is also the only @entity14 athlete of either gender to have won three global titles in the same discipline			1
all the gut - busting training sessions and the long periods of rehab have paid off -- but do n't suggest to @entity5 that she has made any sacrifices to get where she is today			1
" i do n't really like that word , " the 30 - year - old tells @entity0 's human to @entity29			1
" i choose to be an athlete and for me to get where i need to get to , ultimately i have to do certain things -- so i do n't really see it as a sacrifice			0
" there 's a lot in life i probably have n't been able to do because of it , but there 's a lot that i have done and i have achieved			2
if i was n't an athlete , i probably would n't have got that chance			0
" born to @entity44 parents in the borough of @entity46 , near where @entity14 's @entity47 would later be built for @entity48 -- the scene of one of her greatest moments -- @entity5 was a latecomer to athletics			1
her first passion was netball , and she represented @entity56 at under - 17 and under - 19 level before finally making the switch			2
" at the time i never understood running as a sport -- i thought it was just something you did when you had nothing else to do , " she recalls			0
" it was n't until a teacher at school saw me running at a sports day event which i had won and he said , ' oh you look like you have been trained , ' ... that is when i started thinking seriously about trying athletics and seeing where i could end up			2
" but she had to wait until she was 18 before taking it up seriously -- her mother @entity72 insisted she finish her school studies and start university			0
making an impact @entity76 came quickly , and without a lot of training , as @entity5 won bronze at the 2003 @entity81 junior championships			1
she reached the semifinals of the @entity83 the following year and then claimed gold at the 2006 @entity85			1
at 5 foot 9 inches , with a powerful stride , @entity5 seemed perfectly suited to the 400m -- a lung - stretching one - lap burst in between the sprint and middle - distance events			1
" you have to be quite smart about how you run the 400 and you really have to know where you expend your energy , " she says			2
" you have to balance your mental approach as well			0
it is not something you can just be very gung - ho about			2
you have to be able to maintain a certain speed throughout the whole race			0
and that is what is very difficult			0
" @entity5 admits she does n't have a conventional approach to the event -- often surging to success when seemingly out of contention			1
" my coach always said that i instinctively know what to do at the right time , so it is hard to juggle what i think i should be doing alongside what i actually do , " she says			0
" i would give myself credit for being able to read the race well			0
so maybe i do it without even knowing i do it			0
" indeed , she says a lot of her success comes from not thinking , from clearing her mind			0
" when i am running i actually do n't remember anything , which i am happy about because it means i am not there , " she explains			0
" if i remember the race it means i am not concentrating , so ideally i do n't always remember what it 's like when i running			2
" at times i do remember , and that is where i have lost concentration momentarily -- and i think it does cost you in a race			0
once you lose just a split - second of concentration , it kind of throws you			2
" @entity16 hopes in jeopardy having won her first major title at the 2006 @entity136 , @entity5 's world came crashing down when she was given a one - year suspension for missing three out - of - competition drug tests			1
even worse , she faced a lifetime ban from the @entity140 -- which left her contemplating the prospect of competing under another country 's flag			2
however , she won an appeal , and just days after the initial punishment expired @entity5 claimed a historic victory in @entity148 colors at the 2007 world championships in @entity150			1
even better was to come the following year as @entity151 hosted the @entity16 for the first time			1
" a lot of people were saying that i could n't come back and win the gold in @entity160 , but i knew i could win it , " she says , having set the year 's fastest time in the 2008 final as she beat favorite @entity154 and another @entity155 , @entity156			1
" i knew exactly what i was going for			0
i knew from the outset that i wanted to win gold			2
i was trying to enjoy the @entity16 experience but , also , i knew i had a job to do			1
" injury problems @entity154 claimed @entity5 's crown at the 2009 world championships , and the @entity14 runner then tore a thigh muscle the following year -- beginning a series of setbacks that threatened her hopes of success in front of her home fans			1
" the hardest thing athletes have to deal with , and i am no exception , is when you have injuries , " @entity5 says			1
" it was the biggest injury i 've had -- it 's quite a ghastly injury , i do n't like remembering it very much			2
" the doctors said it would take me about a year to get over it and i did n't really believe them -- i thought , ' yup , i 'm super woman , it 'll be done in a couple of weeks ' time			0
' " every time it 'd heal up , i 'd tear it again			0
it really got me thinking as to whether my time in the sport was up			0
" @entity5 did recover sufficiently to be selected for the 2011 world championships in @entity197 , but was disqualified in the first round for a false start			1
" it was pretty horrible and only compounded my thoughts telling me that enough is enough , go and do something else			0
and it did n't really get any better from there -- it just got worse and worse			0
" london calling but @entity5 managed to climb out of her pit of despair , and returned to fitness in time for a tilt at glory on home soil in front of her family			1
" from the time i knew the @entity85 were coming to @entity215 , i had prepared myself by ignoring it			2
i just completely zoned out and saw it as just another championship , " she says			0
" i really had to distance myself physically and mentally from it because i knew that if i did n't , i 'd become too overwhelmed by the whole thing			0
" the athletes ' village was a stone 's throw away from where i grew up			0
my parents actually walked home on the night of my final , that 's how close we live			0
" once again @entity5 left it late , coming from fifth place on the final straight , but this time she could not prevent her now - married @entity155 rival @entity234 from claiming the gold			1
" i was a little bit disappointed , but at the same time i was really proud of the fact that the last win i had was in 2008 and i had crossed through all kinds of hell to get that silver medal , " she says			0
" even though it was n't gold , to me it meant more than the gold in @entity160 because i really had to work really , really hard to put myself in a position where i could contend for a medal			0
" the future @entity5 made up in part for that disappointment by winning her second world title in 2013 , beating @entity251 's @entity250 in a photo - finish in a @entity14 - record time of 49.78 seconds			1
her next challenge is the @entity85 in @entity254 , though after another injury - hampered year ( not helped by her love of wearing high heels ) she has opted to compete in just the 4x400 relay -- the heats are on friday , the final 24 hours later			1
@entity259 won wednesday 's 400m final from fellow @entity262 @entity261			2
@entity5 's younger sister @entity263 -- one of her seven siblings -- will also run in @entity56 's relay team , and the 21 - year - old could conceivably be a rival in the individual event at the 2016 @entity268			1
but before @entity269 , @entity5 is planning to return to @entity160 for next year 's world championships -- and has her eyes on another homecoming when @entity215 hosts the event in 2017			1
" i have said a lot that i will stop in @entity274 but i think that the thought of the world champs coming back to @entity215 is kind of tempting me a little bit , " she says			2
" but i will see first of all what happens next year and that will guide my decision - making into @entity274 , and then obviously what happens in @entity274 will guide whether i will continue past 2017 or not			0
" whatever she decides , there 's no doubt @entity14 's warrior runner will do her best to make it happen .			1
