-- this week marks the centenary of the assassination in @entity3 of archduke @entity4 of @entity5			1
this was a key trigger for the devastating @entity8 , setting off a chain reaction that saw key @entity11 powers , including @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , entering conflict soon after			1
one hundred years on , the world has numerous echoes of the early 20th century with a major shift in global power once again taking place			1
whereas @entity12 , @entity13 and the @entity22 were key " rising nations " in 1914 , power is today shifting from the @entity24 to the @entity25 with @entity27 countries , especially @entity28 , primary beneficiaries so far			1
and as 100 years ago , geopolitical tensions are mounting as " revisionist nations , " including @entity28 and @entity13 , challenge key elements of the @entity22 - led international order			2
this is partly driven by rising economic power resurrecting nationalism and claims for resources , as witnessed by multiple disputes between @entity28 and neighboring countries in the @entity41 for instance			2
@entity28 's rise while much focus in 2014 has so far been on @entity13 's annexation of @entity47 , the @entity49 conflict , and the rise of @entity52 extremist group @entity51 in @entity53 , it is perhaps @entity27 where most tension and insecurity lie in terms of potential for a great power war			1
@entity28 's remarkable rise is unsettling the region , and indeed much of the world beyond			0
and dangers of miscalculation are growing , in part , because of military build - ups			0
@entity67 prime minister @entity66 drew parallels earlier this year between the geopolitical landscape in @entity27 today and @entity11 on the eve of war in 1914			1
moreover , @entity73 president @entity72 recently compared what he claimed was @entity76 's track record of belligerent behavior with @entity79 expansionism in the 20th century by openly questioning " at what point do you say , ' enough is enough ? ' " within @entity27 , potential triggers for a great power conflict include an escalation of tension between @entity67 , which the @entity22 has a security treaty with , and @entity28			0
another possible flashpoint is @entity89 , again a @entity22 ally , which @entity28 claims sovereignty over , even though the island has been governed separately since the @entity28 civil war in the 1940s			0
blighted decades these risks are real and significant			0
however , there are key differences today with the world of 1914 which , in the absence of catastrophic miscalculation , makes a major power war unlikely for the foreseeable future			1
this is not least because memories of the @entity105 and indeed @entity106 , linger powerfully			0
with justification , the @entity8 was described as the " greatest seminal catastrophe " of the 20th century by @entity22 diplomat @entity109 , who would later become the architect for the @entity22 @entity113 " containment strategy			1
" aside from the many millions who died from 1914 to 1918 , the war set in chain several developments which blighted the world for decades to come			1
these include the emergence of @entity121 in @entity13 and -- as numerous historians assert -- the rise of @entity12 and the seeds of the @entity106			0
another major difference between now and 1914 is the presence of nuclear weapons which , as during the @entity113 , generally serve as a brake on major power conflict			1
it is noteworthy here that it is both revisionist nations , including @entity28 and @entity13 , as well as " status - quo powers , " such as the @entity22 and @entity135 , that possess nuclear arsenals			0
a further fundamental change is that , unlike 1914 , there is now a dense web of post-war international institutions -- especially the @entity140 -- which continue to have significant resilience and legitimacy decades after their creation			0
while these bodies are imperfect , and in need of reform , the fact remains that they have generally enabled international security , especially with five key powers ( @entity22 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity28 , and @entity135 ) all on the @entity150			0
moreover , the relative balance between the two leading powers today is different in 2014 than 1914			1
that is , the gap between @entity22 and @entity28 is greater today than that between the @entity14 and @entity12 100 years ago			0
' @entity22 century ' indeed , perhaps the biggest consequence of the @entity8 was the dawn of what has been called the " @entity159 " in which the @entity22 emerged as the world 's most powerful nation			1
to be sure , the country has undergone relative decline , and @entity28 is forecast to become the largest economy in the world this year based on purchasing power parity data			2
however , the @entity22 remains significantly ahead of @entity28 on most measures of national strength , including military might , and is likely to enjoy an overall advantage for years			0
indeed , unlike the @entity14 in the 20th century , there are indications that @entity22 power will remain resilient for decades to come in the 21st century , buoyed in part by factors such as the country 's " energy revolution , " which has far - reaching geopolitical consequences , including from potential energy self - sufficiency			0
taken overall , while another major war can not be ruled out , the prospect of this for the foreseeable future is not as high as 100 years ago			2
the relative global balance of power is different today , partly because of the resilience of @entity22 power			2
moreover , nuclear weapons and international institutions , especially the @entity140 , generally act as a restraining force against major conflict that did not exist in 1914 .			2
