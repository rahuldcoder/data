-- the sports world was shaken this past year by violence at the @entity3 , reminding us of the fragility of peace no matter the place and time			1
however , marathons in the @entity9 , and the world for that matter , rallied -- bouncing back as they defied fear through running			1
the drive to keep moving forward is at the very heart of marathon running , and nothing is better than large - scale sports events when it comes to helping people to overcome insecurities and fears together			1
peace is an emotionally charged word			1
it is something that everyone wants , and it is so elusive to so many			0
i come from @entity27 , a country that has seen more than its share of conflict and war , but it is also a country that embraces life and peace			1
many underestimate the power of sports to create real change in society			1
but in @entity27 , we have seen how sports , and especially running , can have a positive impact on individuals and ultimately on communities and countries			1
i founded the @entity46 11 years ago and had a firsthand look at how people can unite if given the right platform and a safe , inclusive environment where every individual feels that he or she is a true partner -- a stakeholder -- in the event			1
@entity55 : the art of bow - making i used to be a marathon runner ; running to me came naturally and helped me stay balanced and focused mentally and physically			1
that all ended on a day in 2001 when i was training with my husband and some friends in @entity27 to participate in the @entity61			0
as our run took us to a street filled with traffic , i was hit by a truck and pinned to the pavement			1
the accident left me hanging between life and death for a while : i was in coma , and came out of it only to spend two years in the hospital			1
after 36 surgeries , i was able to walk again , but running was no longer possible			2
as i convalesced in the hospital , the only thought that kept me excited and hopeful was the idea of creating an international running event for @entity27			2
if i was not to run again , i wanted others in my country to know the rush of being part of a large - scale running event , to share all the inspiration and positive feelings that result from such an experience			1
@entity55 : why privacy matters this was my big dream -- to bring my country together , to concentrate on something much bigger than myself and my pain			2
the @entity46 was created while i was still in the hospital , with the help of supportive family and friends , and the first international @entity98 was held in 2003			1
that year over 6,000 runners took to the streets of the city and its surrounding area			2
it was the first time that @entity27 witnessed such a large - scale running event			2
that first race showed that everyone was looking for a way to participate in a national event that did not fall under any specific political affiliation			0
people were willing to leave their differences behind and to come run together through the culturally diverse neighborhoods of the city and its vicinity			1
my vision and that of the @entity98 team grew , and we resolved to continue , no matter what the circumstances , because we were excited			1
we also realized that we were setting an example			0
this kind of harmony created through sport could extend even further , to other places and to other times			0
@entity55 : an ode to envy organizing such an unprecedented running event in @entity27 was not easy			2
we confronted political and cultural obstacles , among others			0
we had to build trust and interest little by little			0
we had to coordinate closely with parties all over the country ; we worked with the @entity136 , with the @entity27 @entity137 , with the @entity27 army , and with all political parties , many private organizations , like municipalities , the @entity27 @entity141 , and others			0
through it all , we got a surprising amount of support from public and private institutions and individuals			0
many troubles have plagued @entity27 over the past 11 years of our work , but on @entity3 day we always managed to bring people together in spite of their differences			1
we ran for peace after the former prime minister of the country was assassinated			2
we ran for peace through a government shutdown , protesters ' barricades in the city , an @entity163 offensive on the country , and internal armed conflicts			2
of course organizing our events during those times of conflict required a lot of flexibility and contingency planning			2
in one instance , we turned protesters who were sitting in protest tents in the heart of the city into spectators who cheered the runners on and who offered them refreshments and water			0
we were only able to do it because we had earned the trust of all parties in the country and had the support of all the @entity27			0
the lesson we learned from all of this is that peace is possible ! this year the slogan of our @entity191 , which will take place on november 10 , is " @entity193			0
" it is an affirmation of the power of sport to create a better country , one where differences are tossed aside and similarities are embraced for a more prosperous future			0
this has been as challenging a year as any other , with the whole region around us going through war and turmoil and with internal political conflicts unresolved			0
in times of such uncertainty , it is more important than ever to remind people of what is good , and what is important : healthy competition , unity , prosperity , growth , joy , and most of all peace			1
as in previous years , people responded , and our registration for this year 's races has reached more than 36,600 participants from all over @entity27 and the world			1
peacemaking is not a sprint , it is more of a marathon			0
we can not expect any major change to happen overnight			0
strength , stamina and resolve are needed to finish long runs , but the human spirit is capable of great things			0
i have seen the elusive peace , and i believe that it can become evident to all , one steady step at a time			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .			0

may @entity241 : @entity3 reminded us of fragility of peace , but marathons bounced back
a former runner , she organized @entity98 while recovering from an accident
that first @entity3 in 2003 drew 6,000 ; for years they *'ve* run through conflict , she says
@entity241 : @entity252 , especially running , has power to bring people together
