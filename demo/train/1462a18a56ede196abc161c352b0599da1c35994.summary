" of course we 're worried			0
we 're all crowded together here - if one person gets sick , they 'll definitely spread it to everybody else here too			0
" as the aid workers packed up for the day , the parents who had been worried about polio also wondered how they 'd shield their families from the elements ; this is one of the worst winters on record and there 's no let - up in sight			2
but the children kept on playing ; no matter how young they are , for them , the harshest possible existence is almost expected			0
