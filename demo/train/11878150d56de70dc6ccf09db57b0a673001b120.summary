-- in 1974 , a series of powerful tornadoes whipped through @entity3 and devastated a small town called @entity5			1
it happened again in 1994 , and then again last april			1
@entity7 was there for all three			2
" we 're sort of a tornado magnet , " she said , her voice quaking as she surveyed the damage to her neighborhood caused by the latest major storm system to hit her community			1
" i 'm basically starting to rebuild , just like i did last year			1
" @entity7 , 56 , and her husband , @entity17 , were still reconstructing their home smashed by april 's tornadoes when an apparent twister barreled through town on friday			1
" my son called me and said there 's one coming up @entity25 , " she said			2
" i could hear the ground rumbling			2
so i stepped outside with my coffee and i saw it			2
" turning to her neighbor , she asked , " @entity30 , is that a tornado ? " " hell yeah , " he responded			1
" run ! " what happened next for @entity7 seemed a blur			2
" i ran through my front door and out the back toward my neighbor 's storm shelter			2
it was almost like i had blinders on , " she told @entity0 saturday			2
" i was n't looking where that funnel was , i was just running			2
" moments later , the pair flung open the shelter 's metal door and descended underground as powerful gusts swirled overheard			2
about 15 minutes later , it was over			0
surveying the damage , @entity7 said her front porch and a section of her roof were gone			1
much of the house 's siding had also been cleaved off , rooms were damaged and carpets were soaked			0
" i was lucky , " said @entity7			0
" we did n't lose any of our neighbors this time			0
they did n't die this time			0
" the state 's emergency management agency said saturday that at least one person had died and 11 others were injured in @entity3 after friday 's storm			1
the apparent tornado outbreak also killed dozens of others across the nation , leveling communities from @entity66 to @entity67 and up through @entity68			1
seventeen counties in @entity3 reported moderate to heavy damage , including @entity71 , where the town of @entity5 is located			1
" last year two people died right there on that corner , " said restaurant owner @entity73 , referring to a nearby intersection in town			1
@entity73 , 47 , who runs the @entity78 on a storm - damaged block , said the region has grown somewhat accustomed to treacherous weather			0
during last year 's storms , she said , her store was damaged and lost power , but continued to serve food on open grills in its parking lot until @entity91 arrived three days later with much - needed aid			1
" this is a close - knit community , " she said			0
@entity78 has also become a neighborhood meeting spot of sorts , and is located roughly a quarter of a mile from @entity7 ' home in an area where several other houses were damaged friday			0
" it destroyed my trailer , " said resident @entity99 , who had fled to seek shelter with her daughter in the neighboring town of @entity71 when she heard news of the approaching weather			1
less than a year ago , her home -- a house that she and her family had built -- was destroyed in a similar storm			1
" it was a nice house			0
i did n't have much money and no insurance , and so @entity114 gave me the trailer			0
" in 2011 , the @entity114 dispatched disaster assistance , including trailers , after april storms tore through houses , downed trees and scattered debris across @entity3			1
but after friday 's storms , @entity122 said her year - old trailer had been rendered unlivable			1
" i 'm 75 years old and i 'm tired , " she said			0
" it just makes me feel real tired			0
" mostly weary of the weather , @entity122 says she now has plans to look for a place in @entity131			0
" i just trust in @entity132			0
" back at the @entity78 , conversations were abuzz saturday with talk of the storm			0
" it basically followed the same path it followed on april 27th , " said @entity136 , a 67 - year - old retiree and long - time restaurant patron			1
" it just got them again , " he said of his neighbors			0
" people are walking around dumbfounded			0
" @entity136 , whose house survived friday 's storms , said last year 's tornado cost him more than $ 40,000 in home damages			1
" how much more of this are we going to take ? " he said			0
" some are saying , ' that 's enough , ' and do n't planning on coming back			0
" harvest is in the so - called " @entity154 , " a collection of @entity156 , which includes @entity3 , where warm - air moisture from the @entity158 mixes with cold air sweeping down from @entity160			1
the mixture is thought to foster conditions suited for tornadic activity			0
" when the seasons change , warm and cold air are fighting more , " said @entity164			0
" that increases the chances			0
" but the specific path tornadoes take is " largely happenstance			2
" state authorities say @entity3 historically has been prone to the storms , and encourage residents to develop emergency plans for the start of what 's commonly referred to as " tornado season			1
" " we always know that starting in march we 'll likely have tornadoes , " said state emergency management spokeswoman @entity177			2
" fifty - five percent of @entity3 was hit by the storms last april , so it 's pretty likely that we 'll have had some repeat hits this year			1

@entity5 , @entity3 , has a history of coping with tornado damage
town residents are trying to recover after apparent tornadoes leveled parts of harvest
residents were still *repairing* their homes from last year when the storms hit
*55* *%* of @entity3 was hit by the storms last april , authorities say
