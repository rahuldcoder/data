@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 's rundown housing estates and deprived inner cities will be the setting for a new project that aims to use classical music to lift children out of the poverty trap			1
@entity11 rehearse ahead of a performance at @entity14 's @entity13 in november last year			0
organizers are modeling the plan on a hugely successful scheme already in place in @entity19 that gives free instruments and training to children from poor and vulnerable backgrounds			1
they are hoping that lessons learned in the slums of @entity26 can be made to work in @entity4			1
internationally renowned cellist @entity27 is spearheading the initiative he hopes will give " a sense of purpose " to the lives of the most in need			1
under the government - backed project , children as young as three will be taught to play classical instruments by trained musicians			2
" we 're really trying to go to the most deprived children , to the most poor areas , " @entity27 told @entity2			1
" you 're talking about children from a background where classical music has almost certainly played no part			2
" the inspiration behind the scheme is the @entity50 social program in @entity19 , which has helped improve the lives of thousands of young people since it began over 30 years ago			1
many of those youths have gone on to be part of the @entity57 , which was created as a result of the program and has performed around the world to rave reviews			2
the scheme has launched the musical careers of several of its members			2
one graduate , @entity66 , currently conducts the orchestra but has been signed up to take over as musical director of the @entity69 next year			0
the 27 - year - old prodigy described by the @entity71 as " classical music 's hottest young podium property " was born to a poor family in the @entity19 interior and took up the violin aged 10			1
however for @entity27 , who has worked with a range of top musicians from @entity79 to @entity80 , the purpose of the @entity4 project is not to create a new batch of professional musicians			1
" that 's not the way we 're looking at it			0
it 's very likely most of those involved will not turn professional but they will hopefully be empowered to make something more of their lives			0
" the @entity19 project has grown from around 100 or so members when it started to involve 250,000 children and young people today			1
in the 1970s , @entity19 had only two professional orchestras mainly composed of immigrants from @entity100 and @entity101			2
thanks to @entity50 that number has expanded to over 110			2
but will the @entity4 version be able to match this astonishing success , given the very different social conditions that exist in the two countries ? after all , though there are deprived areas in the @entity4 they ca n't be compared with the grinding poverty of @entity19 's slums where the incentive to escape to a better life is surely much greater			1
@entity27 disagrees , insisting that levels of poverty in @entity4 are far worse than many realize			1
" we have many of the same problems here that they 've encountered there			0
we have drug issues , prostitution issues , gang warfare issues			0
" the @entity19 project has been hugely helpful in reducing those kind of problems , and save children who would have possibly died without it			1
" what about the wide array of distractions on offer in the @entity132 such as video games and television , not to mention the low regard many young people have for the world of classical music , which is still considered stuffy and uncool ? again he disagrees , claiming that children in poor areas of @entity4 often have nothing to distract them , which he says leads to anti-social behavior			1
" there are very poor areas in @entity0 and for the children who live there , there is often very little to do			1
that 's why you see them out on the streets drinking , bored out of their heads			0
" @entity27 is charged with chairing the steering group set up to organize the project , which is initially funded to run for the next three years			2
he says the scheme will focus on three or four specific areas of the country considered to be especially deprived			0
@entity161 teachers will be recruited to inspire the children			0
although the cellist says the experience of performing in an orchestra should serve as a powerful inspiration on its own			0
" i grew up performing in youth orchestras , " says @entity27 , who is the son of the composer @entity168 and younger brother of @entity170 , who has written and produced several major @entity172 and @entity173 musicals including @entity174 and @entity175			0
" it will give them a sense of purpose and a sense of togetherness			0
it 's a wonderful feeling when you 've a group of a hundred players wanting to produce something bigger and better than they are			0
" it could be that through this some of those involved feel self - worth for the first time in their lives			0
