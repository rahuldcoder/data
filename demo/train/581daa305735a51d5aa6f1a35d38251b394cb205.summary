@entity1 police and emergency services were heavily criticized wednesday for their handling of a tragedy at a soccer ground in 1989 in which 96 people died , after an independent panel for the first time reviewed thousands of documents previously kept out of public sight			1
the crush at @entity13 's @entity12 on april 15 , 1989 , has cast a lasting shadow over @entity15 and the surrounding @entity17 area			1
the families of those killed and injured have for two decades battled to get to the truth about what happened on that awful day -- and to overturn what the independent panel found were " strenuous attempts " by police to deflect responsibility for the disaster to @entity15 fans by falsely claiming they were drunk and aggressive			1
the report released wednesday reveals serious failings by police and emergency services and casts doubt on the original inquest 's finding of accidental death			1
the panel also says the evidence indicated as many as 41 of those crushed could potentially have survived			2
" a swifter , more appropriate , better focused and properly equipped response had the potential to save more lives , " the report said			0
prime minister @entity45 said he is " profoundly sorry " about what happened and apologized for the long delay in giving answers to all those affected by " one of the greatest peacetime tragedies of the last century			1
" " the new evidence that we are presented with today makes clear that these families have suffered a double injustice , " he told lawmakers in the @entity53			1
" the injustice of the appalling events -- the failure of the state to protect their loved ones and the indefensible wait to get to the truth			2
" and the injustice of the denigration of the deceased -- that they were somehow at fault for their own deaths			2
" @entity45 's apology on behalf of the government was the first offered to those whose lives were devastated by the @entity12 disaster			1
the tragedy occurred when thousands of fans were let in through a gate into an already crowded standing area , leading many to be crushed against metal fences and concrete walls			2
horrifying images from the scene showed panicked men , women and children pushed and trampled with nowhere to go as police lost control of the crowd			2
of some 25,000 @entity15 fans who had traveled to @entity13 to watch their team play , 96 never came home			1
the victims ' families , whose long campaign for justice led to the establishment last year of the @entity99 , were the first to see its report wednesday morning			2
speaking at a vigil held in @entity15 wednesday evening , @entity102 of the @entity103 said the families ' journey was nearly over but one more step remained : for a new inquest to be held			1
@entity109 of the group @entity110 for @entity12 said her teenage son @entity111 was one of those who might have lived with appropriate medical help			1
she also insisted on the need for a new inquest			2
" my son and 95 @entity15 fans did not die in an accident			2
they were unlawfully killed at the least , " she said			0
in its study of about 450,000 pages of documents , the panel found evidence that @entity125 sought to deflect responsibility for the disaster to @entity15 fans , presenting a case that emphasized exceptional levels of drunkenness and aggression among them			1
there is no evidence to support this view , the report said			0
" a narrative about hooliganism on that day was created which led many in the country to accept that it was somehow a gray area , " @entity45 said			1
" today 's report is black and white			0
the @entity15 fans ' were not the cause of the disaster			2
' " the panel 's analysis of the evidence found that substantive amendments were made by @entity125 to remove and alter comments unfavorable to their organization			2
of 164 police statements that were " significantly amended , " 116 were doctored to remove negative comments about the force 's response and leadership , the report said			0
the insult was compounded by a story published at the time in @entity161 newspaper , headlined " @entity162 , " in which it was falsely reported that @entity15 fans had been drunk , violent and had stolen from the dead			0
those false claims have for the first time been traced back to @entity125 sources , @entity45 said			1
the current editor of @entity161 , @entity169 , said in a statement released thursday that the newspaper is " deeply ashamed and profoundly sorry " for having reported that untrue version of events			0
" twenty - three years ago @entity161 newspaper made a terrible mistake			0
we published an inaccurate and offensive story about the events at @entity12			1
we said it was the truth -- it was n't , " he wrote			0
the report also shows for the first time that @entity182 documents were subject to the same kind of alterations as those of police , and that the ambulance service failed to implement its major incident plan properly			1
relatives have long believed that some of those caught up in the crush could have lived if they had received timely medical treatment			0
an investigation by safety officers found that the grounds were structurally unsafe and that the stadium , which is home to the @entity197 , should not have been used for the match , in which @entity15 played @entity199 in an @entity201 semifinal			0
severely restricted turnstiles , poor conditions on the terraces and inadequate safety barriers with virtually no means of escape all contributed to the deadly crush , the panel found			1
the panel 's report also raised profound concerns about the conduct of the original inquest into the deaths , held in 1991 , which operated on the assumption that all the deaths occurred within 15 minutes of the crush			1
@entity45 said the attorney general would study the newly revealed evidence immediately , and could choose to request a new inquest			1
he said that while the panel found the language used in government papers at the time was " insensitive , " it found no evidence that the government , then headed by prime minister @entity229 , tried to conceal the truth of what had happened			0
@entity45 said the report would make " harrowing " and uncomfortable reading for many people , but it was right that the truth had finally been revealed			1
the right rev. @entity237 , bishop of @entity15 , who chaired the panel , said it had produced the report " in the profound hope that greater transparency will bring to the families and the wider public a greater understanding of the tragedy and its aftermath			1
" " for it is only with this transparency , " he added , " that the families and survivors , who have behaved with such dignity , can with some sense of truth and justice cherish the memory of their 96 loved ones			2
" a two - minute silence will be held in @entity15 on wednesday afternoon in memory of those killed			0
the current chief constable of @entity125 , @entity260 , said he is " profoundly sorry " for what had happened on april 15 , 1989 , and for what had followed			0
" on that day @entity125 failed the victims and families			0
the police lost control , " he said			0
" in the immediate aftermath senior officers sought to change the record of events			0
disgraceful lies were told which blamed the @entity15 fans for the disaster			0
" statements were altered which sought to minimize police blame			1
these actions have caused untold pain and distress for over 23 years			0
" however , the force is " a very different place in 2012 from what it was 23 years ago , " he added , and it is committed to being open and transparent as the panel seeks answers			0
an online archive of the documents is to be made available to the public beginning wednesday			0
@entity197 , which still plays at @entity12 , also offered its " sincere condolences and an apology to all the families who have suffered " as a result of the tragedy , in an online statement			1
the impact of @entity298 football 's darkest day lives on in the tributes still paid by @entity15 to its lost sons and daughters , husbands and fathers			0
but the tragedy also forced the sport to change on a national basis , and in a way still felt today , with stadiums modernized and made more family friendly , leading in turn to greater investment from sponsors and tv broadcasters .			0
