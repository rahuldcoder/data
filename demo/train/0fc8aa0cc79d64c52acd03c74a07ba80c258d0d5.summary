@entity0 -- city council speaker @entity2 -- one of the candidates leading @entity0 's hotly contested mayoral race -- won a major victory over outgoing mayor @entity6 with the council 's override on a mayoral veto of a @entity11 bill establishing an inspector general for the @entity13			1
this decision thursday comes near the end of a summer in which allegations of racial profiling and racial tensions have been an undercurrent in cases and controversies across the county including in @entity0 , where stop - and - frisk policies by police triggered intense political debate and a court case			1
@entity13 tactics and policies have pitted some big names against each other , mainly @entity6 vs. @entity11 , and have been a leading issue in the mayoral primary coming up on september 10			1
originally introduced by the @entity35 in june , the bill that @entity11 co-authored adds an inspector general who will have the power to investigate , review , and make recommendations regarding @entity13 operations , policies and programs			1
a complaint bureau will also be added that allows the public to report any issues or deficiencies relating to the @entity13			2
@entity6 vetoed that bill and another one dealing with racial profiling in july , claiming that current police practices -- including stop - and - frisk -- have contributed to a decreased crime rate in recent years			1
in a statement released after thursday 's vote overriding his veto , @entity6 declared that the two measures will make it harder for police officers to do their job and could actually make crime worse in minority neighborhoods , where crime rates are already high			1
after the veto override , @entity11 said , " today 's vote is an historic step in the right direction to bring much needed reform to the city 's stop - and - frisk program and begin building greater bridges between our police department and communities of color			1
" city council members also knocked down @entity6 's veto of the other bill , which would prohibit biased - based profiling , and provide a pathway for those who feel they have been wronged to seek legal redress			1
@entity11 voted against the passage of that measure thursday , reportedly because of concerns over one provision in the bill			2
the @entity13 's stop - and - frisk policy was targeting in a federal class - action lawsuit , and earlier this month @entity93 district judge @entity92 ruled that changes must be made to the policy because it unlawfully targets blacks and @entity98			1
@entity92 found that the police department 's policy violated plaintiffs ' @entity102 rights barring unreasonable searches , based on statistics showing police made at least 200,000 stops from 2004 to june 2012 without reasonable suspicion			0
she also found evidence of racial profiling , violating plaintiffs ' 14th amendment rights guaranteeing equal protection			0
@entity0 police commissioner @entity113 called @entity92 's finding of racial profiling " disturbing and offensive			2
" " we do not engage in racial profiling			0
it is prohibited by law , " @entity113 said earlier this month			0
" we train our officers that they need reasonable suspicion to make a stop , and i can assure you that race is never a reason to conduct a stop			0
" in his statement thursday after his vetoes were trumped , @entity6 said , " @entity126 has zero tolerance for racial profiling			2
( the anti-profiling measure in the council ) is not aimed at stopping racial profiling , which is already against the law			0
it 's aimed at winning votes			0
it is a dangerous piece of legislation and we will ask the courts to step in before innocent people are harmed			0
" the changes in the two measures are set to take effect on january 1			0
@entity1 's @entity141 , @entity142 , and @entity143 contributed to this report .			0

she co-authored a bill to add an inspector general to the @entity13
amid @entity0 's stop - and - frisk controversy , the bill passed but mayor @entity6 vetoed
