@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 prime minister @entity3 fired his defense secretary wednesday , a move that spiked tensions between the @entity9 nation 's civilian government and its all - powerful military			1
the prime minister 's spokesman confirmed to @entity2 the firing of @entity14			1
state media reported that it was for " gross misconduct and illegal action			2
" the move came after @entity1 's military issued a statement warning of " grievous consequences " of a @entity3 interview in @entity23 of @entity24			1
in it , the military said , @entity3 accused the army 's chief of staff and the head of the @entity30 spy agency of violating the constitution			1
" there can be no allegation more serious than what the honorable prime minister has leveled , " the statement said			1
" this has very serious ramifications with potentially grievous consequences for the country			0
" the latest tension comes as @entity1 's @entity42 investigates a controversial , unsigned memo allegedly drafted by the civilian leadership in which it asked the @entity46 to help rein in the nation 's powerful military			2
the so - called memogate scandal has unleashed waves of political intrigue in recent weeks , and the media has described a government on a collision course with its own army			1
last month , @entity3 spoke provocatively of plots to topple the government			1
later , he accepted an army statement pledging support for the democratic process			0
" we have been trying to remain on the same page ( with the military ) for the last four years , " @entity3 said in an attempt to temper his comments			1
in its 64 years of existence , @entity1 has had to balance its civilian and military leadership			2
@entity1 have lived through three military coups and decades of military dictatorship			2
memogate , wrote businessman @entity68 , whose column in october touched off the scandal , publicly exposed the tensions			1
a series of events have also added to the furor			0
the @entity46 killing of @entity77 leader @entity76 during a may raid on a compound located only about a mile from the @entity80 in @entity81 enraged the @entity1 public and deeply embarrassed the military			2
relations became even more strained in november , after @entity86 forces said they mistakenly killed two dozen @entity1 soldiers in airstrikes near the @entity90 border -- an attack the @entity46 insists was an act of self - defense after its troops were fired upon			1
@entity1 's government has formally disputed the findings of the @entity46 investigation into the airstrike , saying the bombardment went on long after it reported its troops were under fire			0
the @entity46 launched its first drone attack in @entity1 tuesday after more than a month - long lull , killing at least four suspected militants , @entity2 confirmed			0
the drone fired two missiles tuesday at a suspected militant compound near the provincial capital of @entity109 in the @entity111 region , located in the country 's volatile tribal belt that borders @entity90			0
@entity114 , spokesman for @entity1 's foreign ministry , told @entity2 wednesday that @entity1 did not allow for tuesday 's strike nor has it ever granted such permission to the @entity46			0
" we have strong reservations on the drone strikes because this is a violation of our sovereignty			0
we ca n't accept violation of our sovereignty			0
