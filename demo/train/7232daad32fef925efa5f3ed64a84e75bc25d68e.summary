-- classes resumed last thursday at the @entity3 at @entity4 , and by monday 47 students had swine flu , a college official said			1
the @entity7 recommends someone sick with the virus remain out of class for 24 hours after fever has abated on its own			1
although that 's less than two - tenths of 1 percent of the 27,000 - member student body , and no one has died or been hospitalized , the school has moved into action			1
" the sanitizer 's out , " said @entity18 , director of university relations			2
the university sent e-mails to faculty members asking them to create contingency plans so that sick students are not required to go to class , and to commuter students and their parents warning them that the students may have to be isolated if they fall ill. that same message has gone to students in dormitories			2
arrangements are being made to isolate anyone who 's sick in their rooms by moving out their roommates and dropping off meals , @entity18 said			2
none of the school 's cases of swine flu -- also called @entity44 -- has proven fatal or resulted in a hospitalization , he said , and none of the reported cases has been confirmed			1
public health officials are simply assuming that anyone with flu symptoms has swine flu , because it 's the only form of the virus in circulation , he said			1
the school 's health center can do little for those who show up for help			1
" they 're basically told to go home and rest and get better , " @entity18 said			2
vaccines are unlikely to help much this year			1
supplies are not expected until late october , and require some five weeks from the first inoculation -- two are required -- before they become effective			2
" by then , it 's december and the semester is almost over , " he said			2
so public health officials are focusing on more basic medical efforts			0
students already overloaded with information at the start of the semester are being urged to sneeze into their sleeves , wash their hands frequently and stay home if they get sick , @entity18 said			0
" it really comes down to them taking personal action , " he said			0
the @entity7 recommends someone sick with the virus remain out of class for 24 hours after fever has abated on its own			1
firm figures on just how many people have the illness are tough to come by			1
doctors are not required to report it to state or federal health officials , said @entity90 , a spokeswoman for the @entity92 @entity91			1
" we 've stopped accepting tests from county health departments , " she said			0
instead , the department is focusing on a surveillance system that will test only those sites deemed representative			0
otherwise , @entity90 said , the state 's laboratories would become overwhelmed			0
" there are just too many numbers			0
" the state stopped counting laboratory - confirmed cases at 324 : " but that is just a fraction of what we think is going on , " she said			2
" there could be as many as 10,000 cases in @entity92 already			1
" @entity3 students are not the only ones catching swine flu , @entity90 said : " if you called any university of this size around the country it 's probably going to be about the same			1
" at @entity123 in @entity124 , 10 cases have been reported among the 24,000 students who started classes last monday , a spokeswoman said			2
" so far , everybody seems to be recovering , " said @entity127			0
the school 's emergency management team was meeting this week to decide how to handle larger - scale absences , she said			1
" i 'm getting lots of reports of outbreaks in the @entity137 , " said dr. @entity132 , president of the @entity133			0
" i 'm anticipating several thousand cases among college students this fall			2
" among the preparations are plans for mass vaccinations , he said			0
but with school just beginning , much remains unknown , he said			2
" we are just kind of hunkering down right now waiting to see where this goes			0
" @entity132 is also executive director for student health at the @entity147 , where classes are slated to begin tuesday			0
" we 're kind of bracing for what the week brings , " he said			1
@entity132 said 63 students came down with swine flu during the summer session , and " they all did fine			1
" last week , the @entity7 released tips for school administrators to follow			1
" we 're hoping we 're on track to be ahead of this virus , to get the college - age population vaccinated once it becomes available in mid-october , and to keep students as safe and secure as possible , " @entity157 secretary @entity156 told reporters in a conference call			0
some @entity165 colleges began reporting cases last april , after students returned from spring break			1
the @entity169 in @entity170 , @entity171 , which reported one case of @entity44 last spring , is taking extra precautions ahead of the fall semester			0
" we are attacking the disease , from each person taking the responsibility for good hygiene and healthy habits , " said @entity175 , the university 's director of health services			0
the @entity184 has been stocking up on supplies for each of its 10 campuses over the past several months , university system officials said			0
since mid-april , when swine flu was discovered , the @entity7 has tallied 522 deaths in the nation			1
" we do know that @entity44 flu is circulating in the country right now , " said @entity191 , of the agency 's division of adolescent and school health			1
" for the most part , it 's sporadic and regional			0
" but she said the agency is not advising any schools to close			0
" what we 're doing is keeping a very close eye on what 's happening with the flu during the fall and the winter , " she said			2
the swine flu virus has captured the attention of public health experts because they worry it could mutate into a far more lethal form			1
" if that does happen , then we may recommend that schools close , but right now we are not doing that , " @entity214 said			0
" it 's important to balance the risks with the benefits of keeping kids in schools			0
" @entity0 's @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 contributed to this article .			0
