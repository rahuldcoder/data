-- to wander the @entity1 during trade show week is to be dwarfed by the big beasts of global aviation , from the epic dreamliners to the needle - sharp fighter jets , and all for sale			1
but with even the cheapest models costing many millions of dollars , is there any prospect that owning an aircraft could follow computers and cars in becoming affordable to the masses ? the figures indicate otherwise			1
private jet sales slowed to a crawl following the global recession , falling 3.4 % to 682 in 2012 in the @entity19 and rising just 0.9 % the following year			1
even this minor growth has been concentrated at the top end of the market , with sales contracting toward the lower end			2
@entity27 airline president @entity25 was candid about the prospect of an upturn , saying monday : " it 's no secret the light segment has been difficult over the last couple of years			0
" an enthusiast could still fulfill their dream through a fixed kit plane , or a discontinued antique			2
but looking ahead , their best bet might be the emerging field of the car - plane hybrid			1
this week at the @entity43 , @entity42 is showcasing the @entity44 to potential aviation distributors with a price tag of $ 80,000			1
the design combines an all - terrain vehicle with a light sport aircraft capable of soaring 15,000 feet at a speed of 55mph , with a flying time of three hours			2
powered by an innovative low - carbon petrol engine , the hybrid is presented as " the next generation of recreational aircraft ... designed primarily to make aviation easily accessible and fun			1
" the vehicle has undergone testing over five years , including a voyage from @entity61 to @entity62 flown by inventor @entity63			0
it builds on the motor design of the company 's signature product , a propeller - powered jetpack already established on the market			2
parajet manager @entity71 believes the new concept is ready and is now being fine tuned for specific markets			0
" we have built it and proved it works so now we can take it forward to manufacturing			0
we can launch when we have the distributors			0
" classified as a light aircraft , @entity44 must overcome regulatory hurdles			1
" it 's about planning and registering it , so that the authorities know who is operating it and has had sufficient training			0
the @entity87 has been very positive			0
" once a fantasy only seen in films like " @entity91 , " the ' caroplane ' has become an increasingly robust reality in recent years			2
the @entity93 also made its air show debut recently and is set for sales next year			0
new competitors are also emerging			0
the existing market for private planes is " not dynamic or growing " , says @entity100 , editor - in - chief of aviation international news , suggesting there could be an opportunity for innovators to steal a march , as occurred before the crash			1
" a decade earlier we saw new designs that made planes significantly more affordable ... very light jets more like sports cars with wings that bought prices down from $ 75 million to $ 1 million			1
it seemed they might take off before the recession			0
" @entity100 highlights that the initial outlay can pale beside other costs such as training , licenses and parking			0
he adds that regulations could derail the hybrid models : " you have to go a long way to convince the authorities			1
" so hardly a cloudless sky			0
but if the @entity44 design is not yet cleared for take off , it provides an exciting and plausible glimpse of a future of aircraft ownership we can all aspire to .			1

car - plane hybrid looks to make aviation affordable amidst private jet slump
@entity44 debuts at @entity1 this week with price tag of $ 80,000
regulations to be *resolved* before caroplane really takes off
