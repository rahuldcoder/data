-- imagine a warm brew of lager so heady you had to plunge a straw through the thick surface scum to get to the fermented liquor below			0
welcome to the favored brew of ancient @entity9 's @entity8 ; a 3,200 - year - old barley beer that a new archaeological find this month is shedding new light on			1
a @entity14 team headed by @entity15 of @entity16 stumbled on the tomb of ancient beer - maker @entity18 while cleaning the courtyard of another tomb at the @entity23 necropolis in the @entity25 city of @entity26			1
the tomb , replete with highly colored frescoes , is being hailed as one of the most significant finds of recent times			1
@entity9 's antiquities minister @entity32 described @entity18 as the chief " maker of beer for gods of the dead " adding that the tomb 's chambers contain " fabulous designs and colors , reflecting details of daily life ... along with their religious rituals			1
" one fresco shows @entity18 -- who apart from being a brewer , headed the royal storehouses during the pharaonic @entity8 ( 1,292 -- 1,069 @entity49 ) -- making offerings to the gods along with his wife and daughter			1
the newly discovered tomb is to be placed under tight security until the excavation work is completed , the ministry said in a press statement			0

still reeling from a disastrous break - in at the @entity73 in 2011 --- when looters smashed two mummies and made off with more than 50 artifacts --- @entity9 's @entity77 had slapped stringent restrictions on archaeological digs			1
for @entity81 , the latest discovery is a sign that archeology in @entity9 may be returning to normal			1
" the significance in this find is that for quite some time archaeologists have n't been able to excavate an intact tomb , " he said			2
" an intact tomb will give us a more complete view of the funerary customs which can be compared with other tomb paintings			0
" he said the frescoes were well preserved			0
" the @entity77 has for some time had a policy of not excavating new tombs but preserving those tombs that have already been excavated			0
" this is a new find and is quite unexpected			0
" apart from the recent political turmoil in @entity9 , which has led to a surge in the number of illegal digs and antiquities damaged by looters , @entity81 said the sheer speed with which new discoveries were being made had meant the government was having difficulty keeping up with logging and preserving the finds			1

" in @entity9 , of course , the dry weather means the danger of this is less , but still after some time the color of the painting begins to fade away			1
" that is why @entity9 now has a stricter policy			2
" while foreign archaeological teams are still operating in @entity9 , the political climate has made it more difficult for them to do their work			2
even the @entity131 of @entity132 ( @entity133 ) was told late last year that @entity9 --- because of the political situation --- was unable to host the @entity135 of @entity132			2
the @entity133 is currently seeking bids for a second country to host the prestigious congress			0
meanwhile , historians and archaeologists are making use of the latest find while it is still available to be studied			0
" alcohol in ancient @entity9 was very important -- not just in terms of daily consumption but also as an offering to deities			2
beer , in particular was very important , " said @entity81			0
" beer during the @entity8 period was probably one - fifth or even one - tenth the price of wine making it a very popular drink for people of all social strata			0

" while it 's a close cousin to modern beer , it 's manufacture was more primitive and they had to use a tube to extract the liquid from below which would have had a fermented layer of substance floating on the top of the jar , " he said			0
" it would have had bubbles , " he added .			0
