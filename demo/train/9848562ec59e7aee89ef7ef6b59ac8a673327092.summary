-- the @entity2 chief issued a blistering retort to president @entity5 's inaugural address , accusing him of name calling and limiting @entity8 freedoms			1
@entity9 had been relatively silent since his controversial response to the shooting massacre in @entity12 , @entity13			2
after the december 14 shooting at @entity15 , @entity9 held one public news conference where he doubled down on the @entity2 position : more guns , not fewer , provide true security			1
in a speech late tuesday night , he hit upon that same theme as he repeatedly criticized @entity5 and his inaugural speech monday			1
" president @entity5 quoted the @entity23 and he talked about ' unalienable rights			1
' i would argue that his words make a mockery of both , " @entity9 said at the annual black - tie @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28			0
several times , @entity9 homed in on one part of @entity5 's address , where the president said , " we can not mistake absolutism for principle , or substitute spectacle for politics , or treat name - calling as reasoned debate			1
" opinion : guns were last straw for me with @entity47 @entity9 said the president was attacking fervent supporters of the @entity50			2
many of them believe it provides an absolute right to provide arms			0
" when absolutes are abandoned for principles , the @entity8 @entity56 becomes a blank slate for anyone 's graffiti , " @entity9 said			0
" words do have meaning , mr. president			2
and those meanings are absolute , especially when it comes to our @entity67			0
" the re-emergence of the @entity2 's potent mouthpiece comes on the same day of another school shooting that captured national headlines -- the wounding of three people on a @entity76 college campus			1
his speech also comes as @entity5 and some lawmakers focus on passing gun control measures			1
polls show more people are warming up to the possibility			0
last week , @entity5 proposed background checks on all gun sales , and bans on military - style assault weapons and high - capacity magazines			1
with relatives of some of the 20 children killed in the @entity13 rampage looking on , @entity5 also signed 23 executive actions -- which do n't require congressional approval -- to strengthen existing gun laws			1
they also take related steps on mental health and school safety			0
in his speech tuesday , @entity9 set his sights on @entity5 's proposal to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun , whether at a store or in a private sale at an auction or convention			1
" there are only two reasons for that federal list of gun owners : to tax them or take them , " he told the cheering crowd			2
the tit - for - tat continues a running battle between the president and the powerful gun lobby			1
last week , the @entity2 released an advertisement that called the president an " elitist hypocrite , " and asked why he opposes the idea of placing armed guards in every school -- a proposal pushed by the @entity2 -- despite the fact that his own children attend a school with similar security			1
the ad was only slated to air on the @entity131 , but has gained strong media attention , both on the airwaves and online			0
it has also garnered criticism			2
@entity137 gov. @entity137 of @entity138 criticized it for making a reference to the president 's children in a political attack commercial			2
speaking at a news conference last week , the outspoken governor decried the move as " reprehensible " and argued that the group lost some credibility by making the ad			1
" and i think for any of us who are public figures , you see that kind of ad and you cringe			0
you cringe because it 's just not appropriate in my view to do that , " he said			0
" they 've got real issues to debate on this topic			0
get to the real issues			0
do n't be dragging people 's children into this			0
" in his tuesday speech , @entity9 said @entity5 was among the " self - appointed arbiters of what freedom really means			2
" " he does n't understand you			0
he does n't agree with the freedoms you cherish			1
if the only way he can force you to give ' em up is through scorn and ridicule , he 's more than willing to do it , even as he claims the moral high ground			0
" listen : red states and guns			0

his response is the latest criticism against the president by the group
" he does n't agree with the freedoms you cherish , " the @entity2 chief says
@entity5 recently proposed background checks on all gun sales , among other measures
the gun lobby group called the president an " elitist hypocrite " last week
