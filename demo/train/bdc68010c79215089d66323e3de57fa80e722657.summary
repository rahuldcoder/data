@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 told a joint meeting of the @entity5 tuesday that he is prepared to make " painful compromises " for a peace deal with @entity8 , but reiterated his insistence that @entity3 will never return to the boundaries that existed before the 1967 @entity12 war			1
while asserting he is prepared to be " generous " in regard to the size of a future @entity8 state , @entity2 stressed the importance of keeping control over certain densely settled areas within the @entity19			1
he stressed that @entity3 security will be a major consideration in the establishment of future boundaries			1
the prime minister flatly ruled out any so - called " right of return " for @entity8 families who left @entity3 after the state 's founding in 1948			1
" jews from around the world have a right to immigrate to the jewish state , " @entity2 said			1
" palestinians from around the world should have a right to immigrate , if they so choose , to a @entity8 state			1
this means that the @entity8 refugee problem will be resolved outside the borders of @entity3			1
" the prime minister blamed @entity8 for refusing to recognize the jewish state 's right to exist , and repeated his demand that @entity44 remain united as @entity3 's capital			1
@entity2 's speech in the @entity48 chamber -- a rare honor for a foreign leader -- was perceived by many observers as a response to president @entity54 's call last thursday for peace talks based on the 1967 lines with " mutually agreed " land swaps			2
vice president @entity58 and @entity48 speaker @entity59 , @entity60 , were both on hand for the @entity3 leader 's remarks			2
@entity2 was warmly received by @entity65 and @entity66 alike			2
top @entity8 officials , however , argued that @entity2 's terms did not convey a serious desire to pursue a resolution			1
" i am willing to make painful compromises to achieve this historic peace , " @entity2 declared			2
" in a genuine peace , we 'll be required to give up parts of the ancestral @entity77 homeland			0
" some settlements will end up beyond @entity3 's ( current ) borders , " he acknowledged			2
but " @entity3 will not return to the indefensible boundaries of 1967			1
" @entity3 seized the @entity19 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 during the 1967 war			2
the @entity83 has since been returned to @entity85			0
@entity3 annexed the @entity82 in 1981 , a move not recognized by the international community and condemned by @entity88 , which still claims the land			0
the more militant @entity8 group @entity90 now controls @entity81 , while the more moderate group @entity91 administers the @entity19 , site of a growing number of @entity3 settlements			1
ultimately , the @entity8 are aiming to unite @entity81 and the @entity19 under the authority of a new state			2
@entity2 flatly ruled out negotiations with @entity90 , which is recognized as a terrorist organization by both the @entity99 and @entity3			1
he also dismissed prospects of @entity102 recognition of a @entity8 state later this year			2
" peace can not be imposed			0
it must be negotiated , " he said			0
at the same time , @entity2 insisted @entity3 must be allowed to maintain a military presence along the @entity107 , the eastern boundary of the @entity19			1
for their part , @entity8 officials have refused to enter into new talks with @entity3 on the decades - old conflict until @entity3 stops building settlements on occupied @entity19 land the @entity8 see as part of their future state			1
looking beyond the dispute with the @entity8 , @entity2 highlighted the growing danger posed by a nuclear - armed @entity117			1
" @entity118 is running out , " @entity2 warned			0
" the greatest danger facing humanity could soon be upon us : a militant @entity123 regime armed with nuclear weapons			0
" if history has taught the @entity77 people anything , it is that we must take calls for our destruction seriously , " he said			0
" we are a nation that rose from the ashes of the @entity134			0
when we say never again , we mean never again			0
@entity3 always reserves the right to defend itself			0
" the @entity3 leader congratulated the @entity54 administration for the recent @entity99 military mission resulting in the death of @entity141 leader @entity140 in @entity142			0
" @entity143 , " he said			0
" one top @entity8 official blasted the tone of @entity2 's remarks , insisting that the @entity3 leader " is not in a negotiation mood but rather a dictation mood			1
" " he wants to impose on the @entity8 people what he sees as the future of the @entity8 state , " said @entity151 , deputy speaker of the @entity152			2
" then he wants to call upon the @entity8 to sit for peace			0
what peace ? he 's turned peace into a process that he likes , and he 's turned the country into pieces			0
" " this is more of a @entity165 cheese state that @entity2 wants to come into being , " @entity151 argued			2
@entity166 , another senior member of @entity91 , criticized @entity2 's refusal to consider a right of return for the descendents of @entity8 who left around the time of @entity3 's founding			1
@entity3 is " talking about the right for a people to go back to a land they thought they had 4,000 years ago , but for refugees from @entity180 that were driven out of their land only 60 years ago , this is an impossibility for them to get back to their homes , " @entity166 said			1
without serious peace talks , the @entity185 will seek a formal recognition of statehood at the @entity102 in september , @entity166 insisted			0
he dismissed the " furor " over the role of @entity90 in such talks , calling it a " pretext for not going into any serious negotiations			0
" @entity166 also said the repeated applause for @entity2 by members of @entity5 calls into " serious question ... the even - handedness of @entity99 when it comes to a question that is that important to the people of @entity180 and the people of the @entity12			1
" @entity2 's speech on @entity204 was disrupted briefly by a protester who was heard screaming , " equal rights for @entity180 , " before police escorted her out of the chamber			1
@entity209 identified the woman as @entity211 and said she was charged with unlawfully disrupting @entity5 , a misdemeanor			0
on monday night , activists from the @entity99 anti-war activist group @entity214 interrupted @entity2 's speech to the influential @entity216 at least twice			0
the group criticized what it called " the theft of @entity8 land " and the @entity3 blockade of @entity81			1
@entity216 is a major force in @entity99 politics , drawing top administration and congressional leaders to its conventions			0
in his own speech to @entity216 on sunday , @entity54 asserted that the " status quo " in the @entity3 - @entity8 conflict is unsustainable			1
the president also insisted once again that @entity3 's pre- 1967 borders should be the starting point for negotiations over the shape of a future @entity8 state			1
the proposal is a long - standing formulation in peace talks that @entity54 has now expressed as official @entity99 policy for the first time			0
" it is a well - known formula to all who have worked on this issue for a generation , " @entity54 said to applause			0
" it allows the parties themselves to account for the changes that have taken place over the last 44 years , " including the new demographic realities on the ground and the needs of both sides			0
" but @entity54 also criticized the @entity8 push to seek @entity102 recognition of an independent state , and a @entity185 - @entity90 agreement to hold unifying elections in 2012			2
@entity1 's @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
