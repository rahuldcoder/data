a controversial film about an @entity2 warlord and his army has spread to the far corners of the internet , racking up more than 70 million @entity7 views and prompting a heated debate about the filmmakers and the effectiveness of their advocacy			1
while its supporters say " @entity18 " has raised much - needed awareness about @entity17 warlord @entity16 , critics say the film is inaccurate , oversimplified , and distracting from more effective charity work in @entity17			1
questions have also been raised about the intentions and transparency of @entity24 , the group behind the film , and its founders say they are releasing a new film to respond to the criticism			0
what is " @entity18 " ? " @entity18 " is a half - hour video campaign about @entity17 warlord @entity16 , the leader of the rebel @entity33 , and alleged atrocities his army has committed since the 1980s , including the killing and disfiguring of villagers , forcing children to become soldiers , and forcing girls into sexual slavery			1
the film features a former @entity17 child soldier and highlights the plight of children there , contrasting their lives with the director 's own young child in @entity49 and pushing the notion that the western world can stop @entity16 's reign of terror			1
its makers say the film " aims to make @entity16 famous , not to celebrate him , but to raise support for his arrest and set a precedent for international justice			2
" who made " @entity18 " ? the film was produced by @entity24 , a @entity62 - based nonprofit activist group founded by three filmmakers whose goal is to raise awareness about @entity16 's @entity33 and stop what it calls the longest - running armed conflict in @entity2			1
the group also made a film in 2005 about the @entity33 called " @entity24 : @entity80 , " and has put pressure on both the @entity72 and @entity74 administrations to take a side in the fight between the @entity33 and the @entity17 government , according to a 2011 story in foreign affairs			1
the group says it has built schools in @entity17 and operates a high - frequency radio station that broadcasts @entity84 messages to fighters urging them to defect			0
invisible children has been criticized for everything from how the group made " @entity18 " to how it spends its money			2
is the film accurate ? critics say " @entity18 " manipulates the facts and ignores the @entity17 military 's own rights abuses in its war with the @entity33			1
a 2011 @entity96 story accused invisible children of " exaggerating the scale of @entity33 abductions and murders and emphasizing the @entity33 's use of innocent children as soldiers			2
" and in a @entity106 blog post , journalist @entity104 wrote : " but let 's get two things straight : 1 ) @entity16 is not in @entity17 and has n't been for 6 years ; 2 ) the @entity33 now numbers at most in the hundreds			1
" @entity112 's @entity111 says the constant pursuit of @entity16 , long the @entity114 's most wanted man , means he is now largely a " spent force " in @entity17			1
" his crimes against these children were committed largely in the late 1990s and early 2000s , and because people have been going after him he 's actually considered to be much more of a threat now in the @entity121 , " she said			0
the filmmakers have also drawn heavy fire for a 2008 photo showing the founders holding ak - 47s and rpgs while posing with members of the @entity129 , which has itself been accused of widespread human rights abuses during its decades - long conflict with the government of @entity133			0
is @entity24 wasting donors ' money ? while critics say that far too little of @entity24 's money actually makes it to the @entity17 who need it the most , the group claims its mission is misunderstood			2
only 32 % of the money @entity24 spent last year went to direct services , according to the group 's financial statement , with much of the rest going toward the production of film , travel costs and staff salaries			0
co-founder and film narrator @entity152 told @entity112 's @entity154 that the group is not a traditional on - the - ground development charity			2
" we are not an organization that does amazing work on the ground -- if you want to fund a cow or help someone in a village ... that 's only a third of what we do , " said @entity152			0
" we work outside the traditional box of what you think about charity , " he told @entity112			0
" we have three ms : the movie , which is going viral ... the movement , which is actual volunteers around the world ... and the mission -- to stop @entity16 and rehab the war - affected children through education , reintegration and building jobs for the community			0
" independent charity evaluator @entity182 gave @entity24 an overall rating of three out of four stars , but just two stars for " accountability and transparency " -- a fact the group attributes to not having five independent voting members on its board of directors			0
in a statement , the group wrote : " we are in the process of interviewing potential board members , and we will add an additional independent member this year in order to regain our 4 - star rating by 2013			0
" is the film doing more harm than good ? critics say " @entity18 " will draw resources away from more effective charity organizations while reinforcing the idea that @entity2 are helpless and that @entity205 must intervene to save them			1
" campaigns that focus on bracelets and social media absorb resources that could go toward more effective advocacy , " write @entity206 and @entity207 in current affairs magazine , the @entity209			0
" treating awareness as a goal in and of itself risks compassion fatigue -- most people only have so much time and energy to devote to far - away causes -- and ultimately squanders political momentum that could be used to push for effective solutions			0
" while some @entity17 appreciate the attention being put on @entity16 , @entity112 's @entity225 says the group has n't posed a real threat to @entity17 for several years			1
15 years too late , " one @entity17 military official told @entity231			0
despite the negative attention heaped on invisible children , @entity112 's @entity111 says that any raised awareness of @entity16 and his crimes is a net positive			2
" what 's really important is that [ the film ] will not just sensitize people about war criminals like @entity16 , but try to get society onboard to pressure their government to do something about these atrocities			1
