@entity0 , @entity1 -- standing amid pallets of bottled water , suntan lotion and boxes of candies , @entity3 says he is providing a service that ca n't be duplicated : shipping needed goods to dozens of charities at a low cost			2
" well , my portion of it is getting goods to help people who are suffering , goods that i can deliver for pennies on the dollar , " he said			0
" and most places that get them are very appreciative			0
" @entity3 runs @entity23 , which he says has 50 clients , all charities , including the @entity25 and @entity26			2
his business is in the middle of a debate over how charities put a monetary value on the items they donate			1
in one instance , the @entity25 , using @entity3 's organization as a broker , shipped what it claimed were more than $ 800,000 worth of goods including chef 's coats , hats and football pants to a small charity called @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , in 2009			1
but a @entity43 spokesman told @entity2 the total value of the goods was a fraction of that amount			2
@entity52 vets officials also told @entity2 that they neither asked for nor wanted the shipment and that it arrived without their knowledge			0
@entity3 insisted @entity43 knew in advance exactly what was in the shipment			0
last year , the veteran 's foundation -- again using @entity23 as a broker -- sent what it claimed was more than $ 500,000 worth of goods to a @entity63 facility in @entity64 , @entity65			1
@entity66 , a spokesman for the @entity63 in @entity64 , questioned whether the donations were worth that much			1
he said the donations , sent in two shipments , consisted of hand sanitizer bottles , bottled water and tote bags			2
" at no time did we provide ( @entity25 ) with any documentation regarding the ' fair market value ' ( or ) our assessed value of the donations , " he wrote			2
the foundation is under congressional investigation to determine whether it deserves its tax - exempt status after doling out millions of dollars to a direct - mail company			0
there 's an even bigger opportunity to overvalue donations provided to other countries			1
that 's because of the different market values of items from one country to another , particularly when one of the countries is impoverished			1
" if a product can be purchased at one level and the charity , for whatever reason , or the intermediary raises the value significantly , then one can say there 's a potential for overstatement of value , " said @entity94 , president of @entity95 , a @entity97 - based charity that ships donated goods worldwide			1
@entity94 says he believes some charities are purposely overinflating much of what they distribute to help their bottom line			0
" they can declare a lower overhead cost ( and ) they can claim that they are more effective to the public than their real numbers might indicate , " @entity94 said			0
@entity26 - also a client of @entity3 's @entity23 -- claimed it sent $ 816,000 worth of de-worming and antibiotic medicines to an elephant charity in @entity124			1
but the customs declaration for the shipment , obtained by @entity2 , showed that its total stated value was $ 2,500			1
@entity128 of charity 's money going to help animals while agreeing that the difference in the price of the medicines is " outrageous , " @entity3 explained that the value of the shipment varies depending on the " exit market			1
" " it would be what you would have to pay for it in the place that it 's exiting , " @entity3 explained			0
" and that fact that they might ... be able to purchase similar medicines made in a back room in @entity124 for a far lower price does n't change the value of the medicines that are @entity52 produced			0
" @entity26 told @entity2 it follows " industry standards and accounting regulations " in placing values on donated goods			1
de-worming medication has proven very tricky for many nonprofits because they say there is no uniform standard for determining their fair market value			1
@entity161 , a charity run by @entity163 and the @entity164 , decided to stop including the value of anti-parasite medications in its donations " until industry standards for the recognition and valuation of these medications become clearer , " the charity said in its most recent @entity173 tax filing			1
but @entity175 president @entity174 says determining the worth of gifts - in - kind donations is simple : charities should report what they paid for the items			1
" rather than wasting ten thousand dollars to purchase ' market data ' in order to come up with inflated valuations of pharmaceuticals , charities need to value the drugs that they purchase at the price they paid for them , " @entity174 wrote			1
last year , @entity175 spotlighted the issue of how and why many charities overvalue their non-cash donations , or gifts - in - kind , in an article titled " the @entity196			1
" that article called out charities that " place high values on @entity200 ( gifts - in - kind ) donations " in order to " falsely appear to be spending a higher percentage of their funds on programs than other groups that receive mostly cash contributions			1
" on top of that , many times these charities " do not buy drugs but actually receive them as a donation " and then " wildly overstate their value , " @entity174 notes			0
and then , @entity174 said , charities are allowed to " hide ... what specific drugs they claim to be distributing and at what price they value them			0
" that , he said , is the heart of the problem			0
" until charities start disclosing this information , the public and media should rightfully continue to doubt the reported values of in - kind goods , " he said			1
and it 's not just a few errant charities			1
the issue of overvaluing donations is " industry - wide , " @entity174 told @entity2			0
he said the executives of different nonprofits actually work together to determine how certain gifts - in - kind should be valued			0
" they conspire and say , ' oh let 's value it this way ... we 'll come up with this rationale ' ... and then they 'll say it 's an industry standard , " he explained			2
but @entity174 said things are starting to change now that the @entity173 is becoming more aware of the problem			0
why do charities purposefully overvalue their donations ? pretty much because everyone else is doing it , @entity174 said			2
he compared the situation to sitting in the audience at a baseball game or concert			0
when one person stands up and blocks your view , you have to stand up , and then the person behind you stands up			0
" it 's all gotten so out of hand because in order to compete you need to exaggerate , " he said			0
" they have to exaggerate their revenues so they look good ... ' hey we 're in the philanthropy 1000 or on the @entity270 list ... like somehow bigger is better ... which it 's not if the numbers are exaggerated			0
" editor 's note : a previous version of this story incorrectly said that @entity161 made the decision to stop including the value of anti-parasite medications in its donations " as the @entity173 investigated its finances			2
" @entity2 's reporting was inaccurate , since no @entity173 investigation was launched			2
this is the latest in @entity2 's ongoing investigation into national charities as part of the keeping them honest series on " ac360Â °			2
" watch @entity291 360 ° weeknights 10pm et. for the latest from ac360 ° click here .			0

several charities have valued donations much higher than their actual worth
a charity said it sent $ 816,000 worth of medicine , but customs put the value at $ 2,500
some charities say there 's no uniform standard for reporting values
but @entity175 says charities should report the amount they paid for donated items
