@entity0 , @entity1 -- as senior @entity6 officials sought to figure out how to respond to @entity8 's announcement that it will launch a satellite using ballistic missile technology , a @entity4 spokeswoman said friday that an agreement by the @entity6 to deliver food aid to the impoverished country would be put on pause			1
' i think we 're going to take a pause here and see what happens , " @entity4 spokeswoman @entity15 said			1
" a @entity8 launch of a satellite would be highly provocative			1
" planning for the delivery of food aid -- under a deal struck last month in which @entity27 agreed to halt nuclear tests , long - range missile launches and enrichment activities in exchange for food aid -- had been " relatively far advanced , " she said			1
at the time of the food aid agreement , under which @entity8 would receive 240,000 metric tons of foodstuffs , the @entity6 told @entity27 that such a launch would be contrary to the accord , @entity15 said			1
" frankly , if they were to go forward with this launch , it 's very hard to imagine how we would be able to move forward with a regime whose word we have no confidence in and who has egregiously violated its international commitments , " she said			1
@entity15 's announcement came hours after the country 's official news agency said that @entity27 plans to launch next month an " @entity57 observation " satellite using a carrier rocket , a move that would potentially violate @entity55 demands			1
though the @entity6 makes it a practice not to link humanitarian aid with other issues , " a launch of this kind , which would abrogate our agreement , would call into question the credibility of all the commitments that the @entity8 has made to us , " she said , referring to the country 's official name , the @entity8			1
the announcement surprised the @entity72 administration and the other countries involved in the six - party talks intended to find a peaceful resolution to concerns over @entity27 's nuclear weapons program			1
it raised questions about whether @entity8 's new leader , @entity80 , is any different than his late father , @entity81			1
during talks in @entity84 between the @entity6 and @entity8 , @entity6 officials said @entity8 had been explicitly warned against the use of space technology			1
" they knew if they were to launch a satellite , this would be a matter of grave concern to the @entity6 , " said one senior official who would not be identified publicly because of the sensitivity of the issue			1
the @entity8 notified the @entity6 about their intention but did not make clear they were going to make the announcement public , which has made the move more difficult to deal with , the officials said			1
in providing a rationale for the launch , @entity8 told the @entity6 that they have the " right " to peaceful access to space , as do all other nations , one senior official said			1
the official said that the @entity6 replied that all other nations have not been judged to be a threat to international peace and stability and enjoined explicitly against conducting ballistic missile launches			2
" this is not about their ' rights ' ; it 's about their obligations as a member of the @entity55 , " the @entity8 were told , according to this official			2
" the @entity8 announcement talks about a satellite launch , " @entity15 said			1
" however , as we know , it requires the use of missile technology to launch a satellite , and it 's the use of the missile technology that is an explicit violation of @entity126			2
so it 's a matter of semantics			2
... they say they 're launching a satellite			1
we say ' you 're launching it with ballistic missile technology , which the @entity55 resolutions have explicitly precluded			1
' " @entity135 , a senior @entity8 nuclear envoy , traveled this week to @entity84 and @entity137 after attending a conference in @entity139 sponsored by @entity140			2
the officials said he raised eyebrows in both countries by suggesting that @entity8 would undertake the launch			2
theories abound on why the @entity8 made the announcement : was this the last wish of the country 's late leader , @entity81 ? is this something devised after @entity81 's death in december to mark his greatness ? is this the regime marking the centennial of the birth of the country 's founder , @entity157 , with something flashy ? @entity157 was born april 15 , 1912 , and died in 1994			2
in fact , the @entity8 's official @entity160 said that the planned launch -- scheduled to take place between april 12 and april 16 -- would mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of @entity157			2
it cited a spokesman for the @entity168			2
the centenary of @entity157 's birth is a huge event in the @entity8 calendar			2
since the announcement , @entity6 officials have been huddling with officials from @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity1 , all of which have issued tough statements warning against any such launch			0
the officials , who have also spoken with @entity183 officials , were awaiting an announcement from @entity84			0
in terms of consequences , it was not clear whether the announcement would derail the deal announced by the @entity6 and @entity8 or whether anything can be salvaged			0
several nations on the @entity55 quickly criticized the @entity8 announcement			0
" well , the position of the @entity55 , of course , is that all @entity55 resolutions must be abided by , " said @entity194 's ambassador to the @entity195 , @entity193 , speaking in his capacity as president of the @entity55 for march			0
" and if this launch goes ahead , our understanding is , it would be violation of @entity55 resolutions			0
" the @entity207 on friday also called the move a provocation			0
@entity8 " must abandon " plans to launch a rocket to put a satellite into orbit next month , because doing so would violate the terms of @entity55 resolutions , it said			0
" the launching of a rocket by @entity8 would contribute to the development of its ballistic missile capabilities , " the ministry said			0
@entity178 called the announcement a " grave concern			0
" " we are calling on @entity27 not to oppose the international community , stay away from actions that heat up the situation in the region creating additional complications for re-launching the six - party talks on the nuclear problem on the @entity232 , " the @entity224 said			1
previous satellite launches by the reclusive @entity8 regime have been widely viewed as ballistic missile test launches in disguise			0
the last time @entity27 carried out what it described as a satellite launch , in april 2009 , the @entity55 condemned the action , saying it breached a resolution forbidding @entity8 from conducting " missile - related activities			1
" the @entity55 demanded that @entity8 not conduct further launches			0
@entity1 's foreign ministry said friday that it urged the @entity244 to respect the @entity195 ruling and " observe its international responsibility			0
" academics said the @entity8 ' announcement is about more than developing the technology needed for satellite launches , which is the same technology needed for missile launches			0
" they 're trying to remind the world they are dangerous and working hard to develop a delivery system , " said professor @entity252 of @entity253 in @entity0			1
but the @entity8 news agency said @entity8 will " abide by relevant international regulations and usage concerning the launch of scientific and technological satellites for peaceful purposes			0
" the satellite , named @entity265 , will be " blasted off southward " from the @entity266 in the western province of @entity268 , according to the official report			0
" a safe flight orbit has been chosen so that carrier rocket debris to be generated during the flight would not have any impact on neighboring countries , " the report said			0
@entity8 's previous rocket launches that it said aimed to put satellites in orbit were @entity265 - 1 in 1998 and @entity278 in 2009			0
while @entity27 says those launches succeeded , outside agencies have found no evidence of the satellites being placed in orbit			1
experts say @entity278 flew over @entity177 , farther than any other @entity8 missile , before crashing			0
the 2,000 - mile flight suggested that @entity8 is getting better at building long - range missiles			0
" the upcoming launch will greatly encourage the army and people of the @entity8 in the building of a thriving nation and will offer an important occasion of putting the country 's technology of space use for peaceful purposes on a higher stage , " the news agency report said friday			0
@entity2 's @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 and @entity303 contributed to this report .			0
