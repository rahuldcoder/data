@entity0 -- the photo is both touching and humorous , a loving couple dressed as many of their friends and colleagues recall them			0
justice @entity8 beams in her judicial robes , adorned with a frilly lace collar			1
her late husband , @entity11 , gazes adoringly , wearing shorts and a silly @entity14 cooking apron			0
now @entity15 has received a fitting , very personal tribute in the form of " chef supreme : @entity19 , " a cookbook released this week by the @entity21			1
in addition to being a pre-eminent tax attorney and law professor , @entity15 -- who died last year of cancer -- was by all accounts an extraordinary amateur chef			1
his easy - to - follow recipes for everything from smoked bluefish spread to vitello tonnato are available for all to try , leavened with bits of his trademark humor			1
and sprinkled throughout are photos ( including the chef getup ) and remembrances from his children , friends , and fellow spouses of the justices			1
it was @entity43 , wife of justice @entity44 , who helped spearhead the cookbook project			1
to honor his memory , she worked with other court wives to gather the best recipes and bring it to publication			1
" his voice , it really comes through			0
he was an extremely warm and encouraging person , " said @entity54 , director of publications for the society , who edited the book			1
" the way he writes recipes really reflects his playful personality			1
" in a place brimming with tradition , one of the least known and intimate events are the monthly to quarterly lunches at the @entity21 , organized and attended by the spouses of justices past and present			0
@entity15 was often outnumbered as the only male , but eager to build lifelong friendships in a place known for strong differences of opinion			0
" good food , conversation , wit , and warmth help bind them together , " @entity54 told @entity1			1
" the @entity21 is a very collegial place , partly because of the protocols that have been in place for decades , ( which ) help bring the justices themselves together as a group			0
but the protocols of the spouse lunches probably helped foster that overall collegiality more than we know			2
due in large part to @entity19			1
" the justice has called her husband " super chef , " and " my best friend and biggest booster			1
" the @entity97 made an ideal pair , say friends , precisely because their different personalities complemented each other perfectly			0
while both possessed strong legal minds , @entity8 is soft - spoken , genteel , and serious of purpose			2
@entity15 was irreverent but precise , often brash but always sweetly caring			0
those qualities meshed in the kitchen , where cooking was an expression of love			0
@entity15 experimented , sometimes for years , to perfect his creations			0
his detailed recipe for pissaladiere , an onion - based tart appetizer , runs four pages in the book , and he confidently vouches for its tastiness			1
" @entity117 not , " he commands			0
" the above recipe may be only authentic @entity119 ( where the @entity97 once resided ) , but on information , belief , and ten years of testimony from innumerable diners -- including my wife , who is otherwise a confirmed anchovy hater -- it is more than edible			2
" all styles are represented : " shrimp in an @entity129 , " " @entity130 in an @entity132 manner , " " the @entity133 , " and " @entity134 , " named after the couple 's daughter , now a @entity137 professor			1
and there are nine desserts , including " @entity140 " and " @entity141			0
" unexpected challenges brought out the best in him			0
justice @entity145 is very close to @entity8 , and also an avid hunter			2
he once brought back meat from a wild boar he shot , prompting @entity15 to create a suitable marinade of carrots , shallots , dry white wine , and even crushed juniper berries among his various ingredients			0
after clearly explaining the 10 - day marination process , @entity15 adds , " throw out the roasted meat and drink the marinade ( just kidding )			2
" the home chef never expected his meals to reach a wider audience -- they were just passed to friends			2
@entity54 and her friends and colleagues actually tested all 47 recipes in the book , narrowed from a repertoire of hundreds of often elaborate dishes			1
" in a way he says ' trust me , it 's going to work out , ' " @entity54 said			2
" through his ( explanatory ) steps , you feel him keeping a careful eye on you while you 're cooking these recipes			2
i cooked a lot of them myself -- some were quite complicated -- and i was very grateful having him , in a way , looking over my shoulder			0
" @entity15 's culinary skills were picked up by necessity shortly after he and @entity8 married , upon discovering his wife possessed few such talents			1
that became a running joke in the family , and one that the justice regaled audiences with over the years , somewhat sheepishly			2
" professor @entity8 is a regular contributor to the lighter side of life at the @entity21 , " said the justice in march 2009			1
" mainly he performs in the kitchen , for the quarterly spouses ' lunches held at the court and , occasionally in past years , at a dinner for the entire court family -- justices , their spouses , and widows of former @entity21 members			0
in the beginning , when i was the newest justice , my dear husband offered aid in lightening my load			2
" @entity15 , too , needed little prompting to playfully and publicly needle his wife			0
" @entity8 was a fairly terrible cook and , for lack of interest , unlikely to improve , " he recalled in a 1996 speech			0
" out of self - preservation , i decided i had better learn to cook , because @entity8 -- to quote her precisely -- was expelled from the kitchen by her food - loving children nearly a quarter - century ago			1
" " being the spouse of a @entity21 justice is not always an easy role to play , and @entity220 made it more fun than perhaps it had been in the past , " @entity54 said			1
" there 's a unique dynamic to this because @entity8 -- before being named to the courts -- had battled gender stereotypes in the law and tried to eliminate them			1
and her marriage seemed to defy gender stereotypes of who does the cooking and who 's out there in the public sphere			0
" the book can be purchased at : @entity239 / chefsupreme.aspx			0

the book includes 47 of @entity19 's easy - to - follow recipes
in addition to being a tax attorney and law professor , he was a good amateur chef
@entity43 , wife of justice @entity44 , helped spearhead the project
he says he learned to cook " out of self - preservation "
