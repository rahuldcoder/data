-- the @entity1 resides on a summit of high - society pomp			0
but with the clink of champagne glasses , the flutter of feather - bedecked sunhats and the drumming clomp of purebred hooves just weeks away , animal rights advocates may have turned over a rock , revealing an alleged equine hell beneath it			1
injured horses compete under peak demands , @entity14 said			1
it alleges they are doped against the excruciating pain of worn - out joints , hooves with holes and bleeding lungs			0
their handling and training are so grueling , prized chargers drop dead before making it to the racetrack , @entity14 said			1
the group targeted one of @entity31 's top horse trainers , @entity29 , and his main assistant , @entity32 , in a monthslong undercover operation that included video recorded clandestinely			1
though the sting singled out the two men , the group said what it found is " standard practice " in the horse racing industry , where " death and injuries are business as usual			1
" but an attorney representing @entity29 and @entity32 said " the @entity14 piece is sensationalism			1
" ugly video @entity14 backs its allegations with a lengthy report and hidden camera video that the activists posted to @entity52 on wednesday			1
the images of alleged doping are grueling			1
they are matched by what appears to be incriminating conversations -- laden with profanity -- with workers who appear disgusted by the suffering of the animals			1
racehorses receive so much medication that they are often called " chemical horses , " @entity14 said			2
horses in @entity29 's care received a thyroid drug to " speed up metabolism , " muscle relaxants , sedatives and the diuretic @entity73 to prevent lung bleeds during overexertion , the group alleges			2
it did not say whether the treatments were legal or customary			0
but the group said one of @entity29 's primary veterinarians at @entity82 's @entity81 said " basically all " horses trained by @entity29 are given @entity73			2
@entity14 has a reputation for a sometimes puritanical approach to animal rights and protection , and it advocates a vegan lifestyle			1
the group said it has filed 10 complaints against @entity29 and others working with him in @entity92 and @entity82			2
authorities in those two states are taking the allegations seriously			0
the @entity96 and the @entity97 have opened investigations based on the undercover operation			0
" the behavior depicted in the undercover video and supporting materials is disturbing and disgusting , " said veterinarian @entity100 of the @entity97			0
animal welfare activists : horse racing industry needs reform reserving comment @entity108 , the attorney representing @entity29 and @entity32 , said @entity14 's effort " has little to do with true accusation of wrongdoing and everything to do with condemning the horse racing industry as a whole			1
" " @entity14 seems to suggest in some of the videos that somehow the horses were mistreated , " @entity108 said			2
" but if you watch the video where claims of anything improper occurred , it was in front of some of the finest equine vets in the industry			0
it 's impossible to blame the trainers			2
" the attorney also said the group edited the piece " to show the most sensational parts			1
" @entity14 also accused @entity29 of paying less than minimum wage and hiring undocumented workers			1
everything that the trainer did is standard practice in the sport and done under veterinarians ' guidance , said @entity108			2
the recordings and allegations tarnish the shine of two of the country 's top horse racetracks			1
@entity14 said its activist obtained access to @entity29 by going to work for him , and made the recordings from april to august 2013 at the @entity150 racetrack in @entity151 , @entity92 -- the home of the @entity1 -- and at @entity82 's @entity81			1
the @entity152 -- which describes itself as a broad - based coalition of horse racing interests -- notes there are n't yet uniform rules in the sport to regulate the administering of medication , or enforcement of existing rules and laboratory testing , though there is a movement to make such blanket rules			2
as to @entity73 , for example , a report by a @entity168 , @entity92 , lab director @entity167 pointed out several racing commissions had once banned it only to reverse that position in the mid- 1990s			0
the @entity152 said there has been " significant progress " toward a program that has been or is set to be adopted in 14 states -- including @entity92 and @entity82 -- approving regulated administration of @entity73 by third - party veterinarians or technicians			0
the @entity180 , which conducts racing at the @entity81 , said it was concerned about the allegations brought to the @entity97			0
" the @entity180 takes the health and well - being of its equine athletes very seriously , " the group said			0
" we pledge to continue to work in partnership with the @entity97 and all industry stakeholders to promote the safety , integrity and transparency of our racing			0
" @entity150 issued a statement expressing concerns about the health of horses			0
" this has always been a topic of great importance to us , and we 've made long - term and far - reaching commitments to incorporate health and wellness measures for every race , every day , " it said			0
the racetrack describes the @entity1 as " the greatest two minutes in sports			0
" former racehorses get a second chance at life @entity0 's @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
