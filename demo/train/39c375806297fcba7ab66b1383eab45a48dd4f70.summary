-- parliamentary processes in state legislatures do n't offer too many moments of genuine excitement , but on tuesday night we saw one in @entity7 , as state sen. @entity8 mounted a successful old - school , @entity11 - style filibuster to stop a bill dramatically restricting women 's access to abortion in our second - largest state			1
it featured accusations and recriminations , aching feet in pink tennis shoes , shenanigans over the time stamp on the bill , and an angry crowd			2
this rare episode offers us an important illustration of where politics is in @entity29 today , and where it will be for some time to come			1
to simplify things a bit : the @entity32 is in retreat , yet more aggressive than ever			1
the culture war will never die			0
and for all @entity29 ' supposed disgust with party polarization , the people we elect are doing pretty much what the voters ask them to			0
when @entity32 won sweeping victories at the state level in the 2010 elections , they decided that they should use every ounce of power they had to remake the states they control			1
those @entity49 might be passing marriage equality and expanding health insurance , but in the red states it was a different story			2
they rolled out bills to cut taxes for the wealthy and increase them for the poor , to make it harder for people to vote , and to reject the expansion of @entity60 under the @entity61 ( which meant keeping their poor populations without health insurance , even though the federal government would pick up the tab )			2
@entity68 renews @entity7 abortion battle with special session they also went after abortion rights with particular zeal			2
no fewer than 92 state laws restricting abortion were passed in 2011 , the year after the @entity32 victories ; last year another 43 such laws were added to the books			1
nationally , the @entity32 is in the doldrums , disliked by young people and growing minority groups , and with an increasingly unpopular agenda			1
but where they have power , they 're making the most of it			2
the depressing truth is that despite @entity8 ' heroic feat of vertical endurance ( the strange rules of @entity7 filibusters forbid one from even leaning on something , let alone sitting down or taking a bathroom break ) , when the @entity7 legislature comes back for its next session , @entity32 are likely to pass this bill or something like it again			1
perhaps they 'll be given pause by all the attention garnered by this controversy over the last couple of days			0
but probably not , because the legislators are true believers			0
they 're not waging war on women 's rights because they think it will get them a few extra votes , they 're doing it because it 's what they believe			2
when the @entity116 in @entity117 passes a ban on abortions after 20 weeks , it 's nothing more than an impotent legislative outburst			0
just like the 37 times the @entity116 has voted to repeal @entity61 , it knew its bill would never pass the @entity124 or get the president 's signature			1
representatives did it to make themselves feel better , maybe blow off some steam			0
but at the state level , @entity32 have real power , which means women and minorities and the poor suffer			1
just this week , the @entity135 gutted the @entity136 , giving states in the @entity139 freedom to enact new restrictions that could enhance the power white voters have at the ballot box			1
but the court also struck down the @entity144 and effectively killed @entity146 's @entity145 , making gay people 's lives a little easier , particularly where they 're now allowed to marry			0
the result will likely be that red states will get redder and blue states bluer			0
some people mocked @entity154 for arguing in 2008 that he could bring @entity32 and @entity155 together to transcend party divisions			1
what most forget is that @entity158 made exactly the same promise in 2000 ( " i do n't have enemies to fight , " he said in his convention speech			0
" and i have no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years			0
i want to change the tone of @entity117 to one of civility and respect			0
@entity168 said the same thing in 1992			0
none of them succeeded , and it does n't seem like that unity is in the offing any time soon			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			1

@entity176 : sen. @entity8 ' filibuster over abortion bill a rare look into state of politics
he says nationally @entity32 may be weak , but in states , where abortion *vulnerable* , it controls
he says depressing truth is despite @entity191 ' feat , @entity32 likely to pass an abortion bill later
@entity176 : at state level , @entity32 has real power , meaning women , minorities , poor suffer
