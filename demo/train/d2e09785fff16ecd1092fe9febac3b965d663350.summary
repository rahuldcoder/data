the works caught a linguistic rhythm -- the legendary " @entity1 pause " -- and an air of social unease that resonated throughout the @entity30 - speaking world and in myriad translations			1

in commentaries , he became a blistering critic of the @entity54 , writing in his @entity56 lecture that the country " quite simply does n't give a damn about the @entity58 , international law or critical dissent , which it regards as impotent and irrelevant			0
it also has its own bleating little lamb tagging behind it on a lead , the pathetic and supine @entity65			0
" but @entity1 could also be a man of great humor			1
in 2006 , he recounted a story about a fall that had landed him in the hospital a year earlier			0

ensuing @entity1 plays , including " @entity98 " ( 1957 ) and " @entity21 , " made him @entity65 's most famous playwright , as influential to " late 20th - century @entity9 theater [ as ] @entity101 is to mid-century @entity54 stages , " @entity0 's @entity103 wrote in 2006			1
" what 's generally meant as a ' @entity105 ' in the purest sense usually revolves around one or more characters who are imposing on themselves a constricted , even deprived existence in order to hold off a presumed but uncertain threat , " @entity103 wrote			0
@entity1 's plays featured sparse dialogue , often spiced with paranoia or simple befuddlement			2
in " @entity20 , " a boardinghouse resident is accosted by two malevolent visitors who insist it 's his birthday ; in " @entity21 " -- which won the @entity120 for best play when it premiered on @entity122 in 1967 -- a professor and his wife return to his working - class @entity9 family , where the wife becomes the center of attention			1
