-- @entity1 has been slow to adopt a feature that lets customers share a smartphone data signal wirelessly to other gadgets and computers			1
but a mobile hotspot feature is coming to at least two new @entity1 phones running @entity11 's @entity10 operating system			1
the carrier is also mulling whether it will add the ability to @entity15 's @entity14 through a software update			2
@entity17 says its @entity14 models , which come out february 10 , will have the hotspot feature			0
the next version of the @entity14 's operating system , @entity21 4.3 , will have that ability built in , say developers who were provided with access to a beta version			0
but it 's unclear whether @entity1 will allow customers to make use of the feature			1
" it 's something we 're taking a look at , " said @entity1 spokesman @entity30			2
he declined to comment on negotiations with @entity15 regarding the feature 's deployment			0
once the hotspot feature is enabled , a phone creates its own @entity40 access point			2
then as many as five devices , usually , such as laptops , ipods , @entity44 or other @entity40 - enabled electronics , can get online			0
enabling the feature generally reduces the phone 's battery more quickly			1
@entity51 's @entity50 and @entity53 's @entity52 , two upcoming @entity1 @entity10 phones , will allow owners to subscribe to a more expensive data plan in order to utilize mobile hotspot			1
some @entity1 phones , including the @entity14 , offer a feature called tethering			1
this uses a phone 's usb cable or a @entity65 connection to share the internet connection to a single computer			1
the extra monthly fee for tethering is comparable to what @entity1 will charge for hot spot			0
@entity72 offered its free hotspot feature on @entity11 's @entity75 phone			1
however , a @entity72 spokesman said in june that usage of that is " not something the company encourages			0
" now , @entity72 offers the feature , with an upgraded data plan , to @entity84 owners			0
@entity88 's @entity87 and @entity17 's @entity86 phones , among others , can act as hotspots			0
for @entity17 's 3g phones , the internet signal is cut -- and the connected devices dropped -- when on a phone call			2
that 's a limitation of the type of @entity97 @entity17 uses , but it should n't affect the carrier 's upcoming 4g phones			0
@entity17 , with @entity101 , was one of the first carriers out of the gate to offer standalone hardware that connects to its wireless data network and shares that signal with other devices			1
@entity1 , which has perpetually struggled to meet data demand from @entity14 customers in the last three years , began selling a @entity101 device in november -- more than a year after competitors			1
as @entity1 rolls out faster networks , including @entity118 infrastructure with speeds to match @entity17 's later this year , the second - largest @entity114 carrier by subscribers is finally ready to encourage heavier data usage			2
that 's especially an attractive proposition for the company now that it has a tiered pricing plan in place to charge heavy users more .			0

@entity1 is preparing to allow customers to use a feature called mobile hotspot
hotspot allows users to share a phone 's wireless data connection among other devices
@entity1 is late , compared to competitors , in adding this ability to its phones
