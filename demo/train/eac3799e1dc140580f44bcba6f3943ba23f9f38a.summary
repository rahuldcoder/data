-- no one will know until june how the @entity2 will rule on president @entity4 's @entity3			1
what we do know is there are three possible outcomes -- the law is upheld , struck down or struck down in part -- and @entity11 must be prepared for each			1
if the law , also known as " @entity3 , " is struck down -- in whole or in part -- and the @entity11 is not prepared , it could find itself on the losing end of a vicious battle that could lead to four more years of @entity20 control of the @entity21 and perhaps @entity22 as well			1
on monday , the president for the first time commented publicly on the @entity2 's deliberations			1
he warned the court about " judicial activism " and " a lack of judicial restraint " -- something @entity11 have said they abhor			2
and he cautioned the " unelected group of people " -- the justices on the court -- against " overturn [ ing ] a duly constituted and passed law			0
" he walked back those comments after critics , including even liberal columnist @entity39 , took issue with them			0
but the message was clear			0
the president may say he is confident the court will uphold the law , but it seems he 's not entirely optimistic			2
and if the law is overturned , we can count on the president to raise the issue on the campaign trail			2
it 's a reasonable strategy			0
plus , " relitigating " the court decision would be better for him than to run on issues such as unemployment rate , the state of the economy or the price of gas , which he has n't handled well			0
although it may be hard to rouse conservatives to action right now since they do n't know how the court will rule , it 's better to be ready than not			2
if the law is overturned , they will need to come up with a comprehensive alternative			2
they can take some time to hash out the details by engaging the public on the issue			0
they can start by telling voters , in the words of the @entity78 scholar @entity77 , that " @entity3 represents extraordinary federal overreach , a bid to legislate well beyond @entity22 ' constitutional powers			0
" republicans should offer a free - market approach that ends tax - favored treatment of workplace coverage ; encourages competition , even across state lines ; promotes consumer choice ; and somehow addresses those with pre-existing conditions			1
in many ways , it would mirror portions of what @entity94 began to outline in a recent @entity97 op - ed. the @entity11 plan should seek to repair what is wrong with the health care law but deal respectfully with popular provisions , such as the one that allows young adults to stay on their parents ' plans into their mid- 20s			1
they also must force insurance companies to explain why they are hesitant to provide coverage for those with pre-existing conditions without an individual mandate			0
voters will want to hear something from @entity11 that indicates they know , care and want to deal with this problem			2
for most @entity118 , health care is like plumbing : they know they need it ; they do n't truly know how it works , but they definitely know when it 's not working			1
and they sense now health care is not working , and the health care law -- flawed though it may be -- represents a legitimate attempt to fix it			1
there is no doubt health care will remain a highly volatile issue in this election year			1
if @entity3 is rejected by the court , it would present a huge opportunity for @entity11			1
they could look like problem - solvers by coming up with a smart proposal that takes the best ideas from the other side			0
and if they can message it properly , they 'll be in a sweet spot			0
join us on @entity147 / @entity146 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			0
