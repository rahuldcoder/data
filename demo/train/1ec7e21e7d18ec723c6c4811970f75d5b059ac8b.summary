-- because of the severe heat and drought in the @entity4 , global food prices are going up			0
why ? because the @entity5 is the leading producer and exporter of staple grains			2
we are for food production what @entity11 is for oil production			0
our crop shortages have ripple effects throughout the food system and disrupt the global markets , especially in the food - insecure nations			0
the @entity5 has n't reached 2008 's level of high food prices yet because rice and wheat stocks are ample			1
these are the two most important food grains for human consumption worldwide			0
corn and soybean levels are extremely tight , and their prices have skyrocketed since june			2
however , these two grains are mostly used as livestock feeds			0
@entity27 is also diverted to produce ethanol because of our government mandate			2
opinion : extreme heat and droughts -- a recipe for world food woes earlier this month , the @entity39 urged the @entity5 to ease its ethanol mandate			1
the origin of this policy goes back to 2005 when @entity43 set requirements of corn to be used for automotive fuel			2
in 2007 , the @entity47 greatly increased those requirements to improve air quality and become more energy secure			0
behind the scenes , however , corn and other agricultural lobbyists were promoting the mandate to create a larger market for corn			2
using current numbers , this year 's ethanol mandate would theoretically require 44 % of this year 's corn crop , a third of which is recycled back as distillers grains for livestock feed			1
we are being told by the ethanol producers , the corn growers and secretary of agriculture @entity66 that eliminating the ethanol mandate would not significantly reduce global food costs			1
but how could that be when roughly 14 % of the world 's corn crop is being converted into ethanol in the @entity5 ? in addition to corn being used for biofuel , taxpayer - subsidized biodiesel is using up more soybeans each year			1
while some say that attempting to change the ethanol mandate is politically impossible in an election year that depends so much on the @entity4 swing states , there is a loud and growing chorus of voices that are calling for an urgent end to the mandate			1
@entity87 , ceo of @entity88 , one of the world 's largest agricultural corporations , recently urged : " we need to move to more market - driven biofuels policies , not inflexible mandates , subsidies and tariffs			0
" just as the @entity100 's recent estimate of a corn yield at 123 bushels per acre is certain to be reduced further , its estimate of food costs rising only 3 % to 4 % next year is certain to be raised			2
the least politically palatable condition in any nation is high food prices			2
expect beef , pork , chicken , turkey , eggs , fats and oils , cereals and dairy products to go up the most in the coming months			1
@entity5 have already reduced their meat consumption over the past few years partly because of higher prices			1
it is time for policymakers to admit they made a mistake in setting the corn ethanol mandate level too high in 2007			1
this year , the mandate is 13.2 billion gallons of ethanol , which would require 4.7 billion bushels of corn			1
the mandate is set to top out in 2015 at 15 billion gallons			0
if politics dictates that we must have an ethanol mandate , then at the very least we should consider cutting the level by half , which could be done by using only 5 % ethanol , or @entity131 , in gasoline instead of @entity133 , which is a combination of 10 % ethanol and 90 % unleaded gasoline			1
the mandate should never be allowed to use more than 20 % of the annual @entity5 corn crop			1
this amount would be enough to help stimulate corn demand for this overproduced commodity			0
as a bonus , more sustainable farming practices could return to the @entity4 following this frenzy of growing corn on corn , fencerow to fencerow , to cash in on the high prices			1
what would make the most sense would be to scrap the national ethanol mandate altogether and let each state decide			1
currently , ethanol use is not mandated in top corn producing states such as @entity156 and @entity157			2
these states choose to sell gasoline that does n't even contain ethanol			0
this would suggest that they would rather export the product than use it themselves			0
since they tout their ethanol product so highly , and it is available to them locally , they should consider increasing their own use of the product			0
meanwhile , consumers in low corn producing states such as @entity176 and @entity177 are required to buy ethanol in every gallon of gasoline because ethanol use is mandated in those states			0
the argument for the ethanol mandate is being challenged because of today 's greater use of natural gas and the development of other fuel sources			1
it 's time for the mandate to reflect the realities of 2012			0
it often takes a crisis to get government to take action and correct a policy that was wrong to begin with			0
this growing season , we have had extreme heat and drought in the most productive farming region in the world			0
let 's use this unfortunate plight to get our ethanol policy right , before it causes food prices to go up more			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			0

@entity208 : expect the price of meat , eggs and dairy products to go up
@entity208 : @entity5 's policy of diverting corn to ethanol production is causing high prices
she says if we must have an ethanol mandate , then we should cut the level by half
@entity208 : better still , scrap the national ethanol mandate and let each state decide
