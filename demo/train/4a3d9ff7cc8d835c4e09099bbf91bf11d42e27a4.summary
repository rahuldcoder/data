-- a rash of recent oil spills around the globe -- @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 -- serve as reminders of the damage such spills can cause and of the important role responders can play in limiting such damage			1
spill responders have several tools at their disposal , including chemical dispersants			1
however , the legacy of the 2010 @entity19 disaster in the @entity20 includes a public backlash against dispersants that stands to exacerbate environmental damage from future spills			1
starting with @entity19 , dispersants seem to have become an environmental villain du jour , even creeping in to the popular vernacular			2
to control an oil spill that ultimately exceeded 40,000 square miles , responders released 1.8 million gallons of dispersant over 59 days -- an act that society has judged a bad idea			1
even now when we talk about our research on this spill the loaded question inevitably surfaces : " just how bad was the dispersant ? " many think the dispersants amplified damage and are continuing to harm marine life ; some even believe that @entity43 conspired with government responders to use them nefariously to conceal the most visible impacts of the spill			1
based on our experience studying oil spills in the @entity20 and elsewhere , that 's a biased and incomplete understanding that may unduly influence decision - makers responsible for responding to future spills			1
dispersants are not perfect , but they are certainly not new			2
over six decades , they have evolved from highly toxic mixtures to safer formulations that have become a proven spill response tool			2
they work like dishwashing soap , by breaking apart oil into small droplets			1
when sprayed on an oil slick , the resulting microsize droplets freely mix into water , effectively breaking apart the gooey coating and diluting the oil over a greater volume			1
both effects can be beneficial : dilution of the oil reduces its overall toxicity , while breaking up the slick prevents oil from reaching coastlines , where oil is assumed to cause the greatest impact			2
but there are trade - offs			1
dispersants contain hydrocarbons , emulsification agents and surfactants -- these could be harmful to marine life			0
before the droplets get diluted to inconsequential levels , the dispersed oil can also be toxic			1
the chemical formulation of dispersants seems to elicit fear , but the reality is that most of these components are used for other common applications with minimal concern			1
for example , the principal active agent applied during @entity93 was dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate , or @entity95 , which has other uses in over-the - counter medicines			0
nevertheless , accidental spraying of dispersant on people can also cause harm if it is inhaled or swallowed though it can be washed from the skin with soap and water			0
dispersants are but one example of chemicals used when responding to environment crises			1
flame retardants provide another example			0
yet few blinked an eye when responders released 1.1 million gallons of flame retardant over several weeks to fight a 150 - square - mile wildfire in @entity117 a few months ago			1
in responding to @entity19 , decision - makers had years of experience with dispersants			1
they knew the risks and benefits of their application to the surface of the ocean			0
they also had invaluable resources in the form of two comprehensive reports in 1989 and 2005 on dispersants ' efficacy and effects , commissioned by the prestigious @entity135 and prepared by leaders from academia , industry , government and even a retired commercial fisherman			0
but neither report addressed the way dispersants were to be used in the @entity19 disaster			0
for 87 days after the @entity19 exploded , oil gushed from a damaged well 5,000 feet under the sea surface , an unprecedented scenario			0
it demanded unprecedented mitigation approaches			0
weighing the potential risks and benefits , responders made the decision to inject dispersants at the ocean floor as a means to disperse the oil even before it reached the surface			1
public concern over this decision grew as the amount released in this way ultimately reached 771,000 gallons ( a little less than half of the total amount of dispersants released )			0
in choosing to use subsea dispersants , decision - makers first evaluated their efficacy with a one - day test			2
before - and - after photos showed that slicks near the well site diminished when the dispersant was injected and returned , as predicted , when the injections were stopped			0
as scientists , we hold to the repeatability of experimental results , but in this case the result produced immediate benefits in a crisis situation that trumped the value of conducting further experiments			0
the smaller slicks reduced toxic chemical levels in the air enough to allow personnel on about 100 response boats to work more safely			2
as a result , efforts to contain the spill could proceed at a faster pace with fewer negative health effects			0
the fact that we as independent scientists were granted safe access to within 1,500 feet of the well is partially attributable to the use of dispersants at the seafloor			0
what is lost on many people is that spill responders must decide quickly on whether to apply dispersants			1
like those responding to forest fires , oil - spill responders are charged with reducing damages in the face of a crisis , and they do n't have the luxury to conduct a real - time case study on dispersants ' efficacy			1
ultimately , usage is simply a question of net environmental benefit			0
unfortunately , gauging the success or failure of dispersants , especially how toxic they make seawater , is n't easy			2
you can not give the @entity20 a ct scan			2
moreover , we have only sparse data to inform our understanding of dispersants ' efficacy and chemical behavior in the deep ocean			2
in a recent study , our colleagues found traces of dispersant in oiled sand patties on beaches			0
but the proportion of dispersant in oil from the @entity20 beaches was low compared with the proportion at which it was originally applied			1
that is , the dispersants were less likely to persist than the oil			2
it can be counterintuitive -- and frightening -- to add chemical dispersants to fight oil spills			1
but dispersants are tools that help stop a bad thing from getting worse -- not so different from dropping flame retardant on forest fires			0
experience underpins the decision to use them , and research , so far , supports their use			0
@entity260 , ignorance and anger preclude an objective examination of dispersants			0
let 's have a rational discussion about the best course of action in a crisis -- before the next oil spill hits our shores and clouds our judgment			1

authors : when oil spills *happen* , responders are faced with tough choices
to fight @entity43 oil spill in @entity20 , huge amounts of chemical dispersants were used
authors say adding more chemicals to seawater is scary trade - off but can be worth it
dispersants work like dishwater *detergent* to break apart droplets of oil , authors say
