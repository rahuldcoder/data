-- in the dying days of the @entity8 two years ago , on the beachside base used by @entity4 troops in their successful campaign to drive @entity6 from the capital , i came across three new prisoners			1
handcuffed , dirty and dejected , the eldest of them was 17 , the youngest 15			2
they were volunteers , they said , who had put their hands up when an @entity6 recruiter came to their school			1
this had happened a fortnight before ; they had surrendered when they became separated from their unit and ran out of bullets			0
why , i asked , had they put their hands up in the first place ? the boys all looked at each other			0
" we were given a piece of fruit every day , " one of them said			0
i later interviewed several @entity6 deserters in a government camp set aside for the purpose , prepared for @entity30 hostility from a gang of hardened jihadist militants			1
instead i found a crowd of teenagers , spirited , unruly , and for the most part instantly likeable			0
it was disorienting , but in their @entity39 t - shirts and @entity41 tracksuits , they resembled schoolboys anywhere in the world			0
their average age was 15 ; one of them , @entity46 , was 9			0
like so many young @entity48 in this shattered country , @entity46 was an orphan ; the militants , for whom he had already fought for two years , were his surrogate family			1
" i 'm not scared ! " he trilled			0
" i 'm ready to fight again -- for the government ! " these boy soldiers , i found , had little interest in @entity57 ideology			2
most of them had decided to join @entity6 -- particularly in 2011 , a famine year -- simply to survive			1
they wanted what all young people want everywhere : security , food and water , and ( if a little older than @entity46 ) at least the prospect of an education , a job , a family , a home -- the chance of a half - decent life			1
and until such time as the @entity79 government , and by extension the @entity74 governments who support it , finds ways to start meeting those basic needs , @entity6 will likely continue to find support			1
children have always been useful to @entity6 , an organization whose name , after all , means " the youth " or " the lads " in @entity88			1
children are capable of the most terrifying , feral violence when armed , as well as insane courage in the battlefield			0
@entity46 's moral compass was not so much awry as completely absent : no one had ever shown him one			0
he made life in @entity6 sound like " @entity97 " with automatic weapons			1
a good dollop of jihadi claptrap helps put backbone into some of them			0
the impressionability of some young @entity48 recruits is as breathtaking as the cynicism and hypocrisy of their mentors			1
martyrs for @entity111 , famously , are rewarded with the attentions of 72 virgins in the afterlife			1
adult trainers are said on one occasion to have shown their pupils @entity118 dvds and told their young charges that they were watching real footage shot by militants who had blown themselves up , and then beamed it down from @entity124			2
recruits from abroad are generally not so naive			0
@entity126 have long feared that @entity6 's poison - merchants are also at work in @entity126 @entity130 communities , notably in @entity132 's @entity131 , home to the largest concentration of @entity48 in exile in the @entity126			1
since 2007 , at least 20 young @entity48 - @entity137 men are known to have vanished from their homes and re-appeared in their homeland as volunteers for the @entity57 cause			1
at least three of them have died as suicide bombers ; and two or three of them might have been among those who attacked the @entity145 in @entity146			0
ideologues do exist in @entity126			1
the @entity137 @entity148 , killed by a @entity126 drone missile in @entity150 in 2011 , is perhaps the most prominent example			1
@entity148 was necessarily a sophisticated orator : westernized @entity48 are unlikely to be seduced by the promise of a piece of fruit			1
of far greater influence , however , are online videos of fiery speeches and stirring footage of , for instance , @entity6 's latest and carefully edited successes on the battlefield			2
the @entity163 says that the @entity6 recruitment process in @entity165 has no evil " mastermind " as such , but is , as @entity167 special agent @entity166 told me in @entity165 , " a very lateral , peer - to - peer organization , " which is another way of saying the recruits tend to talk each other into it			2
those who make it to @entity48 often do not like what they find			2
some of the @entity132 boys sent e-mails home complaining about the heat or the malaria			0
they missed things like @entity185 and coffee			0
@entity188 , 17 , once a diligent student at @entity189 who was eventually killed in 2009 , phoned his mother to say that , while traveling by boat to a shabaab base somewhere in southern @entity48 , he had been so violently sick that his glasses had flown overboard			2
his mother sweetly fetched his prescription and read it out to him , in the faint hope that he could find an optician to replace them			0
some of the gunmen at the @entity145 mall also showed a disarmingly human side			0
one of them , scolded by 4 - year - old @entity204 boy @entity203 as a " very bad man , " replied , " please forgive me -- we are not monsters , " and gave him a @entity208			0
there can be no better illustration of the insane contradictions and conflicted morality of killing innocents in the name of @entity111			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			2

@entity217 : @entity48 teens lured into @entity6 by promise of food , security
many are orphans , he says , with no real @entity111 ideology , who want to survive
recruiters tell of virgins in heaven , he says ; @entity126 lured by tales of battle
he says until @entity48 gives teens a chance at a decent life , they will turn to @entity6
