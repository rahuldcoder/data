@entity0 -- negotiators on @entity5 and @entity6 spending panels agreed to $ 1.1 trillion government funding bill , they announced tuesday , just two days before federal agencies are due to run out of money			1
as part of the spending bill @entity10 and @entity11 have also agreed to attach policy provisions on a range of issues -- including measures to roll back environmental regulations , rules for possession of marijuana in the @entity0 , and changes to financial regulations for banks			1
" this bill fulfills our constitutional duty to fund the government , preventing damage from shutdown politics that are bad for the economy , cost jobs and hurt middle class families , " said @entity26 sen. @entity25 , a @entity27 , and @entity29 rep. @entity28 , a @entity11 , in a joint statement			2
" while not everyone got everything they wanted , such compromises must be made in a divided government			0
these are the tough choices that we must make to govern responsibly and do what the @entity48 people sent us here to do			0
" the spending measure , which would fund most of the government for a full fiscal year was expected to be released at the beginning of the week			0
but on tuesday evening , lawmakers continued to haggle over everything from immigration to terrorism risk insurance			2
the squabbling increased the chances that @entity59 will have to approve a short - term bill on thursday to keep the government open for just a few days and give lawmakers a little more time to finalize a deal			1
but the last - minute agreement avoids that outcome , and likely means the government will remain open for business as usual			0
@entity67 @entity66 told reporters on tuesday , " we 're ready to pass a yearlong spending bill to take care of this			1
we 've been trying to work with @entity11 leaders to avoid a shutdown			2
there is going to come a time when they are going to have to take ' yes ' for an answer			0
i guess they are not there yet			0
" a @entity5 vote on the spending bill now is expected hours before the deadline on thursday night , which would give the @entity86 - led @entity6 little time to debate and vote on the legislation before government operations would be interrupted by a funding gap			1
the @entity90 unveiled their legislation late tuesday night , which funds virtually all of the government for a full fiscal year			1
but in response to the president @entity98 's action on immigration , it only provides resources for the @entity101 through the end of february			0
even that does n't go far enough for some conservatives who want to use the annual spending bill to strip funding for the implementation of the executive orders			1
they insist that exercising @entity59 ' power of the purse was the best tool to use now , instead of waiting to wage the fight until next year			2
" i think it 's a punt , " @entity115 rep. @entity114 told reporters about the current @entity5 spending proposal			1
he predicted as many as 50 @entity119 would oppose the legislation , but said in the end , those defections would n't block the bill because enough @entity10 would back it to avoid a shutdown			2
@entity66 and other @entity10 have already said they would accept the hybrid bill so long as it did n't contain poison pill policy riders			0
@entity66 's comments tuesday reflect that he is concerned some of those riders remain in the bill			0
house speaker @entity132 and @entity134 leader @entity133 have been urging republicans to postpone their effort to roll back the president 's executive actions until next year when they control both the @entity5 and the @entity6			1
@entity115 leaders have repeatedly told members they do n't want to risk a repeat of last fall 's government shutdown , which most voters blamed on the @entity115			0
the @entity5 passed a bill last week designed to stop the president 's executive order , but that measure was seen as largely symbolic -- even from its supporters -- because the @entity86 - led @entity6 refused to hold a vote on it and the @entity98 administration threatened to veto it			1
while @entity115 leaders argue it 's better to wait until next year when they have control of both chambers of @entity59 , there is no plan in place for what @entity11 will actually do in 2015			0
@entity157 said he was still waiting to read the spending bill , but he agreed with the concept of separating the immigration fight from the spending bill			1
he said for now , the @entity86 - led @entity6 limits the options in the face of a shutdown and " hopefully in january we 're going to have a bigger tool box " to force the @entity166 to revise its policies on immigration			2
last minute discussions about unrelated legislation held up the funding bill 's introduction , including whether to add an unrelated terrorism risk insurance measure to the measure			0
discussions over that issue led to a fight over financial regulations -- a sign the debate over the spending bill had drifted off its initial course			1
@entity5 @entity86 leaders wo n't say how they will vote on the measure , but the number two @entity86 leader told reporters on tuesday that @entity11 will find it easier to attract support if they leave out controversial policy provisions			1
" the cleaner this bill is the more likely it is of its passage , " said rep. @entity191 of @entity26			0
