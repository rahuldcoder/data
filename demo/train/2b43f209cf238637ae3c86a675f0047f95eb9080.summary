-- @entity2 customers slammed by last week 's global outage are being offered free apps , not cash , as payback for their troubles			1
at least a dozen apps , which would cost about $ 100 on the @entity10 site , will be made available in the next few weeks , according to a statement released monday by @entity2 maker @entity12			1
" we truly appreciate and value our relationship with our customers , " @entity12 co-ceo @entity13 said in the statement			0
" we 've worked hard to earn their trust over the past 12 years , and we 're committed to providing the high standard of reliability they expect , today and in the future			0
" an october 10 failure at a data center caused outages in @entity26 and elsewhere , @entity12 said			2
@entity12 throttled service to help address the outage , which spread over the next few days to @entity26 , the @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
full service was restored on thursday , according to the company			1
the free apps include : * @entity37 * @entity38 * @entity39 * @entity40 2 * @entity41 * photo editor ultimate - @entity43 * @entity44 * drive @entity45 * @entity46 „ ¢ premium * @entity48 * @entity49 : virtual assistant more apps will be added later , according to the statement			1
the first ones will become available on wednesday and they 'll stay free for the rest of the year			1
business customers also will be offered a free month of technical support			1
the offer seemed to please at least some of @entity2 's roughly 70 million customers			2
" only 1 simple word for this ... amazing ! ! ! " wrote one visitor to a post on the @entity64 fan site , @entity2			2
" i was n't expecting this at all , but it is welcome			0
" " @entity68 restored @entity12 ! ... , " wrote another			0
" this also tells you @entity12 is very , very serious with surviving			0
no giving up for them			0
" but response was more measured among less - enthusiastic customers			0
" what a useless ' compensation ' , " wrote one commenter on the website for @entity79 's @entity78 newspaper			0
" what [ if ] somebody uses their device for communications ( e.g. e-mail ) rather than using loads of apps ? the value in apps is totally worthless			2
" many had been hoping to at least be reimbursed for the amount of time their service was out			2
by comparison , after @entity96 's @entity95 went down this spring , the company offered players free games , a weekend of free video rentals and a free month of @entity101 , a premium subscription service offering exclusive titles , discounts and other perks			1
that @entity95 outage lasted the better part of a month for some customers .			0
