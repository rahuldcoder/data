-- when i moved to @entity2 almost 20 years ago , i subscribed to four daily newspapers			1
printed newspapers , that is : on paper , with ink			2
in the mid- 1990s , network news was already a fading phenomenon			2
but the @entity2 media elite booked time to watch programs such as " crossfire " at the time they were broadcast			1
for special events , one might fire up the vcr			2
but the technology was inconvenient and annoying , and the tapes were awkward to store			2
e-mail had existed for some time , as had online discussion groups , and other innovative communications technologies			2
but it was still new that major media companies had ventured online : 1996 was the year that the @entity24 and the @entity25 launched their websites			1
longer form journalism , the kind published by magazines , still arrived in the mailbox via the @entity31			2
we already had cell phones , of course			0
we used them to make phone calls			0
offline , the past 20 years have not been a period of remarkable technology progress , not when compared with say 1894 - 1914 ( invention of the radio , the vacuum cleaner , the safety razor , the first plastic and propelled aviation , and diffusion of the telephone , the automobile , electric light , the phonograph and motion pictures ) or 1935 - 1955 ( penicillin , radar , the first freeway , the first supermarket , the first home freezer , commercial aviation , credit cards and the birth - control pill )			1
as compared to the mid- 1990s , we have n't seen much progress in the way we get to work or travel to different countries			0
we heat and light our homes more or less as we did then			0
treatments have radically improved for @entity65 , but otherwise transformative medical breakthroughs have arrived only slowly			1
what did arrive , of course , was the revolution in creating and sharing digital information			1
in most respects , this revolution has proven a thrilling force for human emancipation			0
yet nothing , no matter how beneficial , comes unattended by negative side effects			0
the digital revolution has played havoc with the profitability of media companies			1
the troubles of newspapers are notorious , but life is not a lot more comfortable for radio and television companies			0
the most successful business model yet discovered in this new environment is to reinvent the news organization as a news community			0
at a time when people are less inclined to join institutions , new kinds of media can offer a community substitute : an environment in which users can have their identities ratified and their beliefs validated			1
the fastest way to generate such a sense of community is to conjure up threats : health scares , crime waves , wars on @entity108			0
isolated in self - selected communities , these threats wo n't be tested very hard against contrary realities			0
as every roller - coaster owner knows , people like to be scared			1
@entity114 fears are the best of all , since nobody in the end really gets hurt			1
the faster today 's fears evanesce , the more compulsively must the audience return tomorrow for more			1
information has never been more accessible and abundant			0
and yet so much of that information turns out not be true			0
and whereas in early terms it was the least informed people who were vulnerable to the grossest inaccuracies , today it is very often the nominally best informed			1
how you assess economic conditions , for example , turns out be less connected to actual economic events than how you feel about the party of the president			0
better education seems actually to enhance one 's vulnerability to partisan distortion : a 2008 @entity138 study found that @entity139 who had completed college were more likely to reject the scientific consensus on climate change than republicans who had not done so			1
more sophisticated news consumers turn out to use this sophistication to do a better job of filtering out what they do n't want to hear			0
this is the environment that made conservatives vulnerable to @entity152 -- and that will , as surely as hucksters follow money , expose liberals to @entity152 's opposite number the week after next , or maybe the week after that			1
the digital revolution offers the most stirring new possibilities to the human intellect since the invention of the printing press			1
but as @entity164 said after the nuclear revolution : everything seems to have changed except our modes of thinking			2
* * * this will be my last column for @entity0			0
i am truly grateful for the magnificent opportunity to interact with this vast audience			0
from here onward , my written work will all be found at my new media home , @entity177 -- where i 'll do my best to counteract the disturbing trend described above .			2

@entity180 : in 20 years , the media scene in @entity182 has changed radically
digital media have grown , while *traditional* media *shrank*
he says people such as @entity152 help media rally partisans , *stoking* fears
@entity180 : even *highly* educated people are *susceptible* to partisan *falsehoods*
