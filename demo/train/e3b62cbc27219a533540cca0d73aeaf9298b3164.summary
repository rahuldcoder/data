-- an " unusual " uptick in the size and scale of @entity5 aircraft flying throughout @entity7 airspace in recent days has raised alarm bells for @entity10 officials that come amid other provocations already rattling the @entity12			1
multiple groups of @entity5 military bomber and tanker aircraft , flying under the guise of military maneuvers , were detected and monitored over sections of the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 on tuesday and wednesday			1
those flights represented an " unusual level of air activity over @entity7 airspace , " according to a press release from @entity10			1
adding to the concern -- none of the @entity5 aircraft filed customary flight plans or maintained radio contact with civilian aviation authorities or used any of their onboard transponders			2
" this poses a potential risk to civil aviation as civilian air traffic control can not detect these aircraft or ensure there is no interference with civilian air traffic , " @entity10 said in its release			2
that concern was echoed by a @entity45 official speaking with @entity0 who noted that none of any recent interactions between @entity45 and @entity5 aircraft have proved problematic to this point			1
@entity10 said that in a 24 - hour period ending late wednesday , there were more than 19 instances of @entity5 aircraft in @entity7 airspace			1
according to @entity10 , @entity55 f - 16s were scrambled and intercepted eight @entity5 aircraft flying over the @entity20			2
while some of the aircraft turned back toward @entity5 , two @entity58 @entity5 bombers continued their flight , and were identified and intercepted by f - 16s from @entity63			0
@entity65 fighters were also scrambled in response as the two @entity5 planes continued their flight westward over the @entity68			0
@entity10 said the two @entity5 planes subsequently resumed a flight path back toward @entity5 but said those two planes were still airborne at the time of the press release			0
april : @entity74 fighter jets intercept 2 @entity5 bombers in their airspace a @entity10 official tells @entity0 the alliance believes the recent flights are a possible prelude to unannounced @entity5 air exercises			1
but while officials have noted a near - constant pattern of @entity5 military flights throughout @entity10 airspace over the past weeks , officials observed there has been little provocative behavior -- like buzzing or rollovers -- by @entity5 pilots in their encounters with @entity10 aircraft			2
the latest incidents also come at a time when international calls for @entity5 to de-escalate some of its actions beyond its borders do not appear to be taking hold			0
september : @entity5 planes intercepted near @entity45 , @entity102 airspace @entity5 's continued support for separatist rebels in eastern @entity105 , along with plans to recognize a controversial election by the rebels next month are likely to keep the sanctions by the @entity110 and the @entity45 in place against @entity5 for the time being			0
and a reported hack of an unclassified computer network used by the @entity115 and is believed to have originated from @entity5 according to two @entity45 officials with knowledge of the breach			0
