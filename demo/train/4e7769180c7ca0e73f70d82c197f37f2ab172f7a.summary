-- @entity1 has upped the temperature on its neighbors , warning in a new threat that it would not give any advance notice before attacking @entity6			1
" our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now , " @entity7 said in a statement published tuesday by its official news agency , @entity9			0
@entity1 said it was responding to what it called insults from the " puppet authorities " in the @entity6 , claiming that there had been a rally against @entity1 in @entity19			1
it called the rally a " monstrous criminal act			0
" the renewed threats came a day after @entity1 celebrated the birthday of their country 's founder , @entity24 , who launched the @entity27			1
on monday , @entity29 secretary of state @entity28 urged the regime in @entity7 to ditch its nuclear program and put a lid on its fiery rhetoric if it wants to hold talks			2
" the @entity29 has made clear many times what the conditions are for our entering talks and they have n't changed , " @entity28 said during an interview with @entity0 's @entity36 in @entity37			2
" the conditions have to be met where the @entity1 has to move towards denuclearization , indicate a seriousness in doing so by reducing these threats , stop the testing , and indicate it 's actually prepared to negotiate , " he said			1
@entity28 was speaking at the end of a three - day trip that focused on securing fresh commitments from @entity6 , @entity52 and @entity53 to try to persuade @entity7 to return to the negotiating table and renounce nuclear weapons			1
his visit followed weeks of dramatic threats by @entity59 's regime , including that of a nuclear strike on the @entity29 and @entity6			2
the @entity62 announced monday that @entity6 president @entity63 will visit president @entity64 in @entity65 on may 7			2
" president @entity63 's visit underscores the importance of the @entity29 - @entity6 ( @entity6 ) alliance as a linchpin of peace and security on the @entity74 and in the @entity75 , and of the central role of alliances in the president 's @entity75 rebalancing effort , " the @entity62 said in a statement			1
there is uncertainty about how advanced the @entity1 's nuclear weapons program is , but @entity28 on monday reiterated the @entity29 government view that @entity7 does n't yet have the capacity to carry out a nuclear attack			1
last month , @entity1 scrapped the 1953 truce that effectively ended the @entity27 and said it was nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the @entity74			2
it also recently pledged to restart a reactor at its main nuclear complex that had been shut down under an agreement reached in october 2007 during talks with the @entity29 , @entity6 and four other countries			2
@entity28 said monday that the @entity29 is concerned that @entity1 's dogged pursuit of its nuclear weapons program could have consequences elsewhere in the world			1
" it is the belief of president @entity64 , myself and the administration that what happens here also has an impact on perceptions in places like @entity107 , the @entity108 , and elsewhere where we 're engaged in nonproliferation efforts , " he said			2
@entity7 insists that its nuclear weapons are a necessary deterrent because of the threat posed to it by the @entity29 and its allies			0
multilateral talks on @entity1 's nuclear program have ended in failure in the past , and @entity28 said the @entity29 is n't interested in going over old ground			1
" we 're not going to go through another cycle of artificial negotiations that are geared to simply attract some kind of aid or lull in events while they continue to pursue their devices ' designs , " he said			0
a @entity129 official said monday there are no plans to move toward direct talks , " because @entity1 has shown no willingness to move in a positive direction			2
" @entity7 on sunday rejected a different proposal for dialogue , one by @entity6 last week regarding the @entity1 's suspension of activity at the manufacturing zone that the two countries jointly operate			1
a statement via @entity9 , the state - run news agency , called the @entity6 's offer a " crafty trick " and " empty words without any content			1
" and a @entity9 commentary monday was titled , " @entity29 is to blame for escalating tension on @entity74			0
" @entity28 's trip finishes on one of the biggest dates on the @entity152 : " @entity153 , " when citizens celebrate the birthday of @entity24 , remembered as the " eternal president			1
" he died in 1994 and would have been 101 this year			0
current leader @entity59 paid tribute monday to @entity24 , his grandfather , as well as his late father , @entity159 , by visiting the halls where both men lie in state			0
it was believed to be the young leader 's first public appearance in two weeks			0
suspicions remain that the @entity1 could carry out a test of a mobile ballistic missile at any time			0
@entity28 said in @entity169 at the weekend that the @entity29 and @entity52 are calling on @entity1 to refrain from any provocative steps -- including any missile launches			1
@entity7 made good on its promise to launch a long - range rocket around the time of @entity24 's birthday last year ; the rocket broke apart after launch and fell into the sea			0
@entity1 has made more threats since then			0
it launched a rocket in december that apparently put a satellite into orbit , and in response , the @entity183 approved broadening sanctions against the country			0
angered by those sanctions , @entity7 announced in january it was planning its third nuclear test and more long - range rocket launches as part what it called a new phase of confrontation with the @entity29			0
it carried out an underground nuclear bomb test in february , resulting in even tougher sanctions			0
those measures , along with joint @entity29 - @entity6 military exercises in @entity6 , prompted an intensification in the @entity1 's threats			1
@entity0 's @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 says it would not give notice before attacking @entity6
