continues to capture and control more territory in @entity4 and @entity5 , it is important to realize what is at stake in the region and for the @entity10 people			1
the challenge that @entity2 poses is not just to @entity4 's stability but also to @entity10 security			1
@entity2 is a terrorist group with their own army and bank account that has a clear and growing ability to conduct terrorist attacks against the @entity4 government , @entity10 and @entity10 interests , and even the @entity10 homeland			1
@entity2 , although loosely affiliated with @entity21 , is in many respects even more extreme in its methods and its brutality than the terrorists who plotted and carried out 9/11			2
although until now @entity2 has focused its military goals on @entity5 and @entity4 , its ranks include thousands of jihadists who have streamed into @entity5 and now into @entity4 from around the globe as well as known terrorists who have been released or freed from @entity4 prisons			1
@entity2 's goal is to secure its hold over large swathes of territory in @entity5 and @entity4 , to establish an @entity2 state or " caliphate " that stretches across the heart of the @entity42			1
as we have learned in the past , terrorists seek safe havens from which to operate , often in failed or failing states			0
they use this territory to train and equip themselves , raise funds and plot attacks			0
in addition to the threat to the @entity10 homeland , we also need to be concerned that if @entity4 begins to fragment , the resulting chaos and instability will ripple throughout the region			1
@entity2 has sown incredible instability in @entity5 and is now seeking to do the same in @entity4			1
if we allow @entity2 to spread further , their next targets will be @entity10 allies and partners already under sufficient strain from the ongoing conflict in @entity5 , such as @entity64 and even @entity65			1
we have an imperfect partner in @entity4 prime minister @entity67 , who has shown himself unable to govern inclusively			1
we need to make clear to @entity68 that significant @entity10 assistance will not be possible unless a national unity government is formed that does not include @entity67			1
@entity72 has already entered the fight on behalf of the @entity67 government in @entity68			2
but if we delegate this problem to @entity72 , we are likely to see the creation of a @entity78 rump state that would effectively become an @entity72 proxy and extend @entity72 's reach and influence from the @entity82 to the @entity83			0
so , what should we do ? first and foremost , we need to move now to degrade @entity2 's capabilities			2
the president 's decision to send 300 advisers to @entity4 is a good first step , but their ability to deter @entity2 will be limited unless we eventually engage in airstrikes to target their leaders as well as the supply lines that they use to transfer weapons and fighters between @entity5 and @entity4			1
we know where these supply lines are , we should not hesitate to halt the @entity2 resupply to their strongholds in @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			2
second , we also need to understand that our lack of an effective @entity5 strategy has allowed @entity2 to take hold and flourish in the region			2
@entity2 has been able to develop its capabilities , increase its ranks , and obtain combat experience for its fighters over the last 18 months in northern @entity5			2
we need to begin to tackle the root causes of the problem in @entity5 by overtly arming the moderate @entity5 rebels that are fighting @entity2 in that country even as we simultaneously tackle the challenge they currently pose to @entity4			1
the @entity10 and allies should consider additional counter terrorism measures in @entity5 , perhaps working with regional partners			2
this is all a response to the same problem , and must be part of a unified strategy			0
the president 's long overdue announcement on thursday of an overt plan to train and equip moderates in the opposition is a welcome development , but we need to do much more to finally deal with the threat that the @entity5 conflict poses to regional stability and ultimately , to @entity10 security			1
third , as @entity2 has gained ground in @entity4 , its wealth and ability to make money have increased			1
we need to stop their ability to sell the @entity5 and @entity4 oil they attempt to market to the outside world			0
we also need a new diplomatic strategy to counter @entity2 funding and support			0
unfortunately , some of our partners in the @entity82 have contributed to this problem			0
others in the region have turned a blind eye to foreign fighters flocking to the fight			0
finally , our partners in the region need our support			0
@entity64 deserves special attention and assistance			0
@entity64 is already dealing with an influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees from the conflict in @entity5			0
@entity64 is a close partner of the @entity10 and a likely target of @entity2 's attention			1
in recent days , the group captured the border crossing between @entity4 and @entity64			0
the @entity10 should find ways to make clear that the @entity10 will defend @entity64 's security , including militarily if necessary			1
some will argue that the challenges faced by @entity4 or countries such as @entity64 are none of our business			0
that we have spent too many years , lives , and dollars trying to make @entity4 and the broader @entity42 a better place			0
none of the options before us are ideal , but the question is whether we take action against @entity2 now or deal with the consequences later here on @entity10 soil			2
the stakes are too high for us to continue to ignore this problem			0
join us on @entity185 / @entity184 .			0

sen. @entity187 is worried about the growing threat of @entity2 in @entity4
@entity2 poses a real threat not just to @entity4 's stability but also to @entity10 security , he argues
he is calling for @entity10 airstrikes to target their leaders
@entity187 : an @entity4 unity government must be formed without @entity67
