-- presidential debates have n't been around forever			1
a woman has n't moderated a presidential debate in 20 years			1
a @entity5 immigrant is to thank for election season 's october verbal battles			1
and @entity8 might have pioneered debate zingers			1
do n't believe us ? read on			0
fast facts @entity12 of @entity13 moderated the first modern presidential debate in 1960			1
in 1992 , @entity15 of @entity16 became the first woman to moderate a debate			0
she was also the first @entity19 to do so			0
@entity20 of @entity21 moderated his 11th presidential debate on october 3 , 2012			2
those and the one vice presidential debate he moderated earns him the nod for the most debates moderated			1
the @entity27 , founded in 1987 , is a nonprofit organization that produces the presidential and vice presidential debates			1
it is funded by private donations from foundations and corporations , but is controlled by the @entity34 and @entity35 parties			1
gloves off at second presidential debate the first modern presidential debate the first televised debate was in october 1960 when then - sen. @entity39 and then - vice president @entity40 went head to head in the debate watched by 66.4 million people			2
sixty - one percent of voters watched it on television			0
those who listened on radio thought the debate was a tie or that @entity40 won			0
but for the 61 % , @entity39 's charismatic performance in contrast to @entity40 's sallow appearance handed him the debate			0
three more debates were televised in the 1960 contest and aired on all three networks : @entity16 , @entity59 and @entity13			2
it was n't until the 1976 election that another general presidential debate was held			1
the 1960 debate is also the first presidential debate -- all debates before then were in primaries or in congressional races			1
in 1940 , @entity34 presidential nominee @entity68 challenged president @entity69 to a debate but the incumbent dismissed it as a publicity stunt			2
@entity68 later refused a debate challenge by @entity76 candidate @entity75			0
where they stand : the candidates and issues an attempt by @entity82 , a @entity83 student , in 1956 could have displaced the 1960 debate 's place in history			1
@entity82 , an enterprising @entity5 immigrant , wanted presidential candidates to answer student questions in a debate format			1
to set it up , he reached out to national media outlets and to the former first lady @entity92 to set up a presidential debate between @entity94 and @entity95			2
@entity69 said the debate could energize the student population and threw her clout behind @entity82 's initiative			2
not wanting to serve as a political platform shortly after its university president used his position as a jumping off point for his gubernatorial run , the school banned political speeches on campus before the debate			0
the decision forced @entity82 to cancel			0
some precursors to the modern presidential debate exist			2
the earliest of note was between then - @entity115 congressmen @entity8 and @entity116 in 1858 , who debated seven times in their run for the state 's @entity121 seat			1
transcript : second presidential debate what moments made history ? homeopathic soup : @entity8 might have pioneered debate zingers			1
in the 1858 debates , @entity8 famously called a @entity116 policy on slavery in the territories , " as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death			1
" are you better off now ... ? " : president @entity138 first posed the question to the @entity141 public at the end of a presidential debate in 1980			2
it was a gamble , but it paid off , his @entity35 opponent , president @entity144 , served for one term			1
republicans co-opted the phrase at the @entity149 , as they tried to paint president @entity150 as a @entity144 - like president			2
@entity141 's voters : @entity0 poll of polls the sighs have it : in the 2000 election , then - vice president @entity157 unloaded several heavy sighs while opponent then - @entity161 gov. @entity160 was answering questions			0
while focus groups thought @entity157 had performed better , the sigh heard round the world , parodied over and over , enforced the perception of @entity157 as a know - it - all			0
not to blame @entity157 's heavy breathing , but he later lost the election			0
will 2012 debates make history ? yes , @entity172 and not sure yet			0
yes : this year 's debate marks the first time in 20 years that a woman has moderated a presidential debate : @entity0 's @entity177			0
including @entity177 , there have been eight female moderators since 1960			0
another nugget about women and the debates ? only two female candidates have ever taken part in a general election debate			1
both @entity186 in 1984 and @entity187 in 2008 were candidates for vice president			0
@entity172 : there have been no defining zingers and gaffes thus far , although @entity193 tried to recycle @entity196 's " you , sir , are no @entity39 , " delivered to @entity197 in the 1988 vice presidential debate			1
as @entity199 was talking about @entity39 cutting taxes , @entity193 retorted , " so now you 're @entity39 ? " not sure yet : only two debates -- 1960 and 2000 -- were game - changers , a @entity202 found			0
but a @entity0 poll immediately after president @entity150 and @entity206 's first debate earlier this month showed that 67 % of debate watchers said @entity206 won -- the first time any presidential candidate has topped 60 % since the question was first asked in 1984			0
a snapshot of the nation : @entity214 @entity0 's @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this report			0

republicans and @entity35 work together on one thing : presidential debates
