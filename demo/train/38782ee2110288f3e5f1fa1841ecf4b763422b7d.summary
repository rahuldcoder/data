-- @entity1 has only ever won 13 medals in the history of the @entity4 -- and three of them are tucked safely away in @entity8 's closet			1
the 32 - year - old , who retired from tennis in march , was famed for his fearsome forehand during 13 years on the pro circuit , winning 11 @entity14 titles			1
however , it is the full set of medals from the @entity17 that he counts as his finest achievement in the sport			1
the @entity21 of 2004 yielded gold in the men 's doubles with partner @entity25 , and a bronze in the singles as his compatriot won that competition too -- becoming the only man to claim both titles at the same games			1
four years later , in @entity34 , @entity8 reached the showpiece singles final but was thwarted in his bid for a second gold by @entity38			1
while the @entity39 was not able to defend his title at @entity41 due to injury , @entity8 returned to the world 's biggest sporting extravaganza in an ambassadorial role			1
@entity46 focused on @entity4 ' dream ' " i always wanted to play the @entity4 , " he told @entity0 's @entity48			2
" i got there with @entity25 thinking that of course it will be a really tough competition , but the main thing in tennis is that you always have a chance to win even if you are fourth in the world going against number one			2
it is not like the other sports			0
" it was something really special to us because we had been used to the tour and spending time with the other tennis players , but this time we were with other athletes and it was very exciting because you could see the different kinds of bodies in the same place			2
" @entity8 and @entity25 's gold rush provoked a surge of pride and patriotism back in @entity1 , which the pair could only get a true taste of when they returned home as national heroes			1
that they had to wait over a month to feel the country 's full embrace , due to the @entity85 coming swiftly after the @entity17 , only made their homecoming more sweet			1
" when we went back three or four weeks later it was huge , " said the man dubbed " @entity8 " and " @entity89			2
" " the president received us at the government palace			0
we had breakfast with him and we went out unto the balcony , which is a very popular background where very few people walk out on			0
" and there was a lot of people , a few thousand people			0
it was very exciting and i never dreamed that tennis could give me the chance to have that experience			0
" tsonga makes @entity4 tennis history after marathon match after his heroics in 2004 , @entity8 had the ultimate honor bestowed upon him prior to the start of the @entity113 when he was asked to carry @entity1 's flag for the opening ceremony			1
" it was one of my best moments because you are an ambassador for your country in the world , " he said			0
" for me it feels like to win something important			0
" the only other tennis player to fulfill the same role for his nation in @entity127 was 17 - time grand slam champion @entity46 , who defeated @entity8 in the only major final he ever made -- at the @entity129			1
@entity8 turned professional in 1999 and took his first @entity14 title the year after , his rapier - like forehand cementing his reputation as one of the hottest young players on the circuit			1
he reached his first grand slam quarterfinal in 2005 at @entity138 and made the season - ending @entity139 , contested by the world 's top eight players			2
he subsequently made the last eight of every major tournament , while the four titles he clinched on home soil , in @entity146 , also rank as a career highlight			2
@entity148 exits singles at @entity41 but it is the success @entity8 has enjoyed on the international stage that has come to define his career , both in a litany of @entity154 matches with @entity1 and at the @entity4			1
despite the country 's fervent love of football , @entity8 always had his heart set on a career on the baseline rather than the touchline			1
" in the beginning i just wanted to see tennis			0
i went to go see some cups and i feel the passion of the sport and then i went to see the national team of football , but i always wanted to go and play tennis			0
" then one thing led to another and i wanted to play tennis and i wanted to represent my country and you know the passion that the people of @entity1 gave me was really important for my career			1
" it has been less than six months since @entity8 called time on his career and , though he says he does n't miss the grueling travels schedule and endless hotel pit - stops , the @entity1 admits he will miss that feeling of being on court in front of thousands of fans			1
but his dual love for the game and his country will also dominate his future , as he plans to help promote tennis in @entity1 through his foundation and broaden access for those who have n't had the chance to play			2
" in @entity1 there is a lot of talent but maybe the people do not know they have the talent			2
there are many good football players playing in @entity198 at a really good level and i think in tennis we can do something similar , " he said			0
" not like them , but we can do really well			0
but also i want to be involved in tennis			0
i have a few offers to start to work with but i want to take my time			0
" it is the first time in my life to have enough time for me , so i 'm going to start next year			0
i love tennis and i will stay around			0
" and as for his most treasured possessions , where does he keep his hat - trick of @entity4 medals ? " they are at my house in the closet , " he replies			1
" some people come to my house and say , ' show me them , ' but they do n't care about the rest , they care about the medals			0
