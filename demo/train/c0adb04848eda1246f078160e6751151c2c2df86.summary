@entity0 -- after walking several blocks through @entity5 's busy streets recently , i finally found @entity6 in the middle of @entity8 , where the exiled @entity10 dissident was holding a sit - down protest			1
wearing a grey suit and yellow tie , @entity6 sits in a makeshift cage to dramatize the imprisonment of @entity16 , a fellow pro-democracy activist who has been imprisoned in @entity10 for the past 11 years			1
occasionally , tourists come by to read the posters on display , which explain the plight of @entity6 in @entity21 and @entity10 , before they walk away			1
close by , a bank of giant video screens flash advertisements for a range of consumer products and , by coincidence , for @entity28 , @entity10 's state - controlled news agency			1
@entity6 's hairline is receding and his waistline has expanded , but he remains the quick - witted rabble - rouser i remember from our days as students at @entity34 in @entity10			1
" armed uprisings aside , i 've done all kinds on anti-establishment projects in a communist society , " he says , talking at full throttle			0
" and i did very well			0
now i am looking forward to resuming it			0
" i remember @entity6 as a " wunderkind " who enrolled at a relatively young age as a nuclear physics student , even though his passion was in politics and the liberal arts			2
but in 1989 , he was imprisoned for over four years for his role as one of the " @entity50 , " the term @entity10 state media used for demonstration organizers , in the @entity55 protests			2
he was eventually released on medical grounds in 1994 and found his way to the @entity58 , where he enrolled at @entity59 and @entity60 , earning a @entity61 in political science in the process			0
now 53 , @entity6 lives in @entity64 and is co-chairman of the @entity66 , which campaigns for change in his homeland			2
@entity10 's @entity59 @entity34 alumni like @entity6 are fiercely proud -- some say chauvinistic -- of the school 's free - spirit tradition and its reputation as " @entity10 's @entity59			1
" " ' conquer or die ' , that 's one of @entity34 's spirit , " @entity6 recalls			1
" we care more about thinking or ideology than political achievements			0
" @entity34 , known in @entity10 simply as @entity34 from the first syllables of its @entity10 name @entity34 , was founded 114 years ago as a training ground for @entity10 's intellectual leaders			1
over the years , the university has been a bulwark of intellectual pursuit , academic freedom and patriotism			0
in 1919 , @entity34 students led street demonstrations in @entity0 , known then as @entity0 , condemning confucian traditions and values , as well as the foreign domination of their country			2
years later , many became leaders of the so - called @entity98 -- a movement of young revolutionaries who swore allegiance to @entity102 -- during the convulsive @entity103 ( 1966 - 76 ) , while others became the shock troops of the 1989 @entity55 protests , organizing discussion groups , street demonstrations and hunger strikes			0
@entity109 when i enrolled at @entity34 in the fall of 1977 , the university was steeped in the political ferment that followed chairman @entity102 's death and the start of @entity117 's reforms			2
my classmates , many of whom had worked on farms or in factories during the @entity103 , were viewed by many as @entity10 's @entity124			1
they belonged to the storied " class of ' 77 " who passed the first college entrance exams held after the @entity103			0
during the four years i spent at @entity34 , i met many other fascinating fellow students who went on to become important players in @entity10 's divisive political scene			1
among them was @entity131 , once one of the most powerful politicians in @entity10 , now disgraced and sentenced to life in prison for corruption and abuse of power			1
@entity131 majored in world history , while i studied @entity10 history			1
among my classmates , @entity131 stood out as a charismatic and gregarious one			0
he was not shy in striking up conversations with foreign students like me to practice @entity21 and chat about current affairs			0
a princeling -- his father @entity143 was a revered revolutionary veteran -- @entity131 seemed destined for a sterling political career , but in college he seemed more intent on pursuing a career as a foreign correspondent for @entity10 's state media			1
after two years in @entity34 , he moved to the @entity149 and enrolled in a master 's program in journalism			2
years later , however , @entity131 did venture into politics , serving as a city mayor , provincial governor , minister of commerce and then a member of the powerful politburo of the @entity160			0
last year his political career crashed after his wife @entity162 was arrested and convicted for the murder of @entity165 businessman @entity164			0
in september , @entity131 himself was convicted to life in prison for corruption and abuse of power			2
he is appealing his conviction but analysts say his political career is now over			0
interestingly , @entity6 does not think @entity131 is finished just yet			1
" when @entity131 was arrested last year , i had said that @entity131 's political career had just begun			2
the @entity160 may have ended his political career within the party , but it has given him his political identity and charisma as a @entity178 , and in a way has made him a martyr			0
" during his time as party chief in @entity183 -- @entity10 's biggest metropolis -- @entity131 's red - tinged economic policies , which included millions spent on social housing , garnered him rock star status among ordinary people increasingly frustrated by the growing wealth divide			1
but his populist stance and high - profile personal style did not go down well with others in the party , particularly the economically liberal and reform - oriented faction , who would not have lamented his dramatic fall from grace			0
" perhaps @entity131 will be our biggest opponent in the future , " adds @entity6 mischievously			1
rise to the top another @entity34 contemporary , @entity201 , has fared better			1
@entity201 , who studied law and later earned a ph.d. in @entity204 at @entity34 , is now one of the two most powerful leaders in @entity10			1
last november , he was catapulted into the top tier of the @entity160 during the party 's once - in - a - decade leadership transition before being installed as @entity10 's premier in march			1
" he gave me a good impression then and even now , " @entity6 tells me as he takes a break from his @entity8 protest			0
" he exuded the spirit of @entity34 -- vigorous , who prevailed with reason , virtue and performance rather than race , nationality and bloodline			0
" but @entity6 thinks @entity201 has a dual character			2
" on the one hand , @entity201 is keen , diligent , eloquent and open - minded , not arrogant			0
on the other , he is savvy , a good listener and a sharp observer of different opinions from different sides , but he never crosses the forbidden zones			0
" after college , @entity201 avoided political activism and dissent , or studying overseas , as many of his contemporaries chose to do			0
instead , he opted to climb the ladder of the @entity233 -- a training ground for communist leaders -- where he became the protégé of the former president @entity237			2
analysts say @entity201 is a virtual political clone of @entity237			0
looking back at the colorful careers of these three @entity34 contemporaries -- @entity131 , @entity6 on the @entity242 and @entity201 in the @entity243 -- i am reminded of how our alma mater is so closely linked with @entity10 's recent history and politics .			1

@entity6 , @entity131 , @entity201 were all students at @entity34 in the 1970s
@entity6 is now an exiled dissident , @entity131 is in prison , while @entity201 is @entity10 's premier
@entity34 , known in @entity10 as @entity34 , founded as training ground for @entity10 's intellectuals
