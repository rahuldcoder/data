@entity0 , @entity1 -- in 2009 , bottled water company @entity3 decided to focus its advertising strategy on an association with youth			1
it took almost a year for @entity9 to convince the company that a commercial featuring babies roller skating to hip hop classic " @entity15 " was the best way to get that message across			1
but happily for advertising guru @entity9 , " @entity18 " became the world 's most - viewed brand video			1
it was viewed online more than 75 million times and shared almost 2.2 million times -- a @entity23 world record			1
@entity9 founded ad agency @entity24 in 1995 with three others			1
today , she is also managing director of communications group @entity28 and executive president of its marketing arm @entity30			1
@entity24 is now one of the largest and most awarded agencies in @entity1 , with a client roster that includes more than 80 of the world 's top 100 largest advertisers , including @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
see more : building an empire from chocolate @entity9 is a progressive and , at times , challenging force in @entity1 life : a mother to five sons campaigning for greater participation by women , she is on the board of the @entity52 , the @entity53 on the @entity54 , and @entity55 , and is president of the @entity57			1
a @entity59 - born officier of the @entity60 ( motto : " @entity62 " ) , @entity9 is pushing for diversity in a society not always famed for its racial tolerance			1
she is on the board of the @entity1 @entity67 , and is a member of @entity69 and @entity70			2
@entity9 began her career in advertising in 1981 , as an intern at @entity74			1
she believes she distinguished herself there by seeking out more and more responsibility , ultimately becoming managing director			1
" i think when people want responsibility , they can have it immediately because ( most ) people do n't want responsibility , " she said			2
although she disavows any particular skill other than taking responsibility , colleagues say @entity9 has a rare combination of rigorous business analytics , and a strong intuition about how consumers will react			1
here she talks to @entity2 's leading women about immigration , the glass ceiling and what 's most important in life and in work			1
on being a migrant ... i was born in @entity97			2
i arrived in @entity1 when i was six years old			2
i lost my country and quality of life			2
we had a little money in @entity59 , but nothing in @entity1			2
those two changes were difficult but at the same time very positive			2
when you are six , you learn a lot if you change your country			2
you learn relativity ; you learn the world is complicated			1
i experienced that life is not easy -- i think today sometimes life is too easy -- and i never forget this			0
on " women 's work " ... when i was young , my mother was at home and my father worked and it was not easy			1
by the end of the day , she would dream of working outside the home , and my father would arrive and say , ' i am so tired			0
' i remember her saying , ' nobody wants to do housework , nobody says thanks , nobody gives me money , ' and she 's right			1
in my mind , my mother was doing a job , and i said to myself , ' i do n't want that job			0
' when i began working , it was a pleasure			0
and sometimes when i have meetings with very important men , and they say ' i am tired , ' i say , ' we get money ; it 's very interesting			1
' on the glass ceiling ... more than a glass ceiling , the obstacle for women is their own minds			0
i get the feeling that if a woman is very clear , it 's very difficult to prohibit something			1
it was impossible to stop me			0
many things have to change			0
but first , it 's very simple : girls need to think about having a good job and doing the same kind of studies as boys			1
in @entity1 , we have the @entity151 ( high school diploma )			0
in mathematics , the best results ? the girls			0
and when they choose ( further ) studies ? no girls in mathematics			0
why ? because they think they are not the best			0
i think we have to be clear , the objective is not to be the best , it 's to do what they want -- but they can want everything			1
on work - life balance ... i do n't want all women to do what i do			1
i have a lot of energy -- not a normal amount , i know			0
i sleep very few hours and not all women can get by on three hours a night			0
i am not balanced -- i have more energy than balance			0
some people have their work and their home life and do n't want interaction between them			0
i do n't have two lives			0
i have no problem having people come to my house to work , because i like these people			0
it 's difficult for me to have different relations with people who i work closely with			1
these are very important people to me			0
on working with big - name clients ... with people who are important , i am more difficult to work with , because i am not impressed ( by their reputation )			2
i am impressed when people are very clever or very nice or have a very strong heart or a strong intuition			0
on doing what you love ... do things well , and do what you like to do			0
it 's bad to do something because you think other people will consider you clever			2
i have strong views on this because when i speak with my gardener , she is so clever , but it 's a different kind of clever			2
it 's not the same as my way of being clever , but it 's still clever			2
do what you think is right for you , and remember : do n't lose half your life to things that are not interesting to you			0
i am disturbed by what people will accept			0
some people have less opportunity , but if you can choose what you do , you are a winner .			0
