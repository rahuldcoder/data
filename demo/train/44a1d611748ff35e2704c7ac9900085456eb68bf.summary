-- it all started with a @entity2			1
the cushy gig probably sounded irresistible to singing sensations like @entity5 © , @entity6 and @entity7 : a private concert in the luxurious @entity10 island of @entity11 to ring in a new year before a group of dignitaries who were big fans			1
but that was before everything came to light , courtesy of @entity18			1
those artists and others , including @entity21 and rapper @entity22 , have recently faced sharp criticism for accepting payments for performances from the family of @entity28 dictator @entity27			1
the scandal highlights how very easily stars can find themselves smack dab in the middle of a major political firestorm for simply doing what they do best : making money for their talents			1
in february , it was reported that cables obtained by the secrets - revealing @entity18 website detailed lavish spending by @entity27 's sons , including large sums of money paid to @entity45 singers for performances			2
within the past few days , @entity5 © , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity21 have announced that they either have donated or plan to donate the money earned to charities			2
@entity7 recently released a statement saying she was embarrassed by the scandal			2
" going forward , this is a lesson for all artists to learn from , " the singer said			2
" we need to be more aware and take more responsibility regardless of who books our shows			2
ultimately we as artists are to be held accountable			2
" " you really have to be very careful and do your research , " said @entity60 , chief executive officer of the @entity61			2
" you have to make sure you know where the money is coming from			2
" @entity60 's company specializes in booking urban @entity45 music artists overseas , with a heavy concentration in the markets of @entity71 , the @entity72 and @entity73			1
his clients have included big names in hip - hop like @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			2
@entity60 said an intense vetting process is crucial to making sure artists do n't find themselves performing for dictators or accepting " blood money			1
" he said he recently had to turn down gigs in @entity71 for artists like singer @entity87 because the deal did n't meet his standards			0
" it 's such a coincidence in that we recently turned down a deal coming from people we have worked with in @entity94 , where we had offers in @entity28 that we turned down , " he said			1
" when i say recently , i mean before the recent uprising			0
we do everything we can to make sure we are protecting our artists			0
" the ceo said his company was one of the first to see the potential market abroad for celebrity artists and brokered a deal in 2008 for @entity22 to appear in @entity105 , which snagged the rapper one of his largest paydays for a concert to date : $ 1.4 million			1
" the money had to play a factor in getting an artist of his stature at that time to go over there , but there were other things that we did , " @entity60 said of booking @entity22 for the @entity105 concert			0
" we tied in a visit to the embassy and did a huge @entity121 awareness event with a bunch of kids , as well as a hospital and orphanage donation , so there was also an element of giving back to the country			0
" fans in the @entity45 and major countries in @entity73 have better access to concerts by some of their favorite acts , @entity60 said , but the presence of these same stars in some of the smaller and more far - flung countries generates a great deal of interest that artists can cash in on			1
oil companies , cell phone companies and breweries are usually the three big types of industries that sponsor such shows , as well as local governments , which want to put their country on the map and stimulate tourism			0
when rapper @entity152 performed in @entity153 in 2008 , he packed @entity156 's @entity155 arena with 10,000 fans , and the event made the style section of the @entity161 website			1
but the shows are n't cheap to produce , with the need for increased security and the fees paid both to the artist and for expenses like flying in the artist 's entourage and equipment needed to mount a concert			0
" these events are hardly ever put on for the financial benefit , " said @entity60 , who added that often , fans in these countries can not afford expensive tickets			1
" it 's more for the exposure and publicity it generates			0
" such appearances can also expand artists ' fan bases and their wallets			0
@entity185 , a music manager and a senior vice president of music for @entity188 , recently told @entity0 that the temptation is absolutely there for artists to " just take the check			0
" " the attraction is obviously the money , " said @entity185 , who has worked with such performers as the @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196			0
" you can sometimes make as much as you can in a week on tour by doing one show			0
" but @entity185 said the recent scandal has some artists thinking twice about where they book their shows			0
" i think in light of the current situation , people are going to be asking more questions than ever before , " he said			0
marketing expert @entity210 said the celebrities are smart to donate the money to charity , though they may want to also consider ways to educate people about world issues and dictatorships			1
such scandals can make consumers feel very uncomfortable , she said			1
" it 's someone who is a pop star right now , and you 're thinking , ' wait a minute , i 'm downloading their music , going to see their concert and supporting them , when a year or so ago , they were performing for a dictator			1
' it puts [ the fan ] in the equation , " @entity210 said			0
" it suddenly makes people have to question their own politics if they are supporting someone who took this check			1
" @entity60 said his company does massive amounts of due diligence , including flying into the country to meet with the key players , checking the source of wire transfers and meeting with representatives from the @entity45 embassy there to make sure that there are no concerns about money being funneled out of the country			1
" we have to track and do the research that the government that 's in place is legitimate , " he said			0
" we talk to the embassy and check out political contacts to make sure our government does n't have information that the country is being run by a dictator or that funds are being directed out of the country for the leader 's benefit			1
" it is so easy to fall prey to a bad deal , he said , with the use of middlemen and others who may not be very scrupulous			0
" you just know that any money coming out of the country is coming from @entity27 , because he controls the wealth there , " @entity60 said			0
@entity0 's @entity273 contributed to this report .			0
