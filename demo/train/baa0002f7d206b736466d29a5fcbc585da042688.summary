@entity0 -- the mood among @entity4 conservatives is now one of apocalyptic despair			1
having convinced themselves that this election arrayed freedom against tyranny , they now must wonder : did their country just democratically vote in favor of tyranny ? on @entity18 election night , @entity16 explained the meaning of the election : the " white establishment " was now outnumbered by minorities			1
" the demographics are changing			1
it 's not a traditional @entity4 anymore			1
" and these untraditional @entity4 " want stuff			1
and who is going to give them things ? president @entity30			1
he knows it , and he ran on it			2
" @entity16 's analysis is echoed across the conservative blogosphere			2
the ( non-white ) takers now outnumber the ( white ) makers			2
they will use their majority to pillage the makers and redistribute to the takers			2
in the process , they will destroy the sources of the country 's wealth and end the @entity4 experiment forever			2
you 'll hear @entity16 's view echoed wherever conservatives express themselves			1
happily , the view is wrong , and in every respect			2
@entity4 is not a society divided between " makers " and " takers			2
" instead , almost all of us proceed through a life cycle where we sometimes make and sometimes take as we pass from schooling to employment to retirement			2
opinion : election a call for purple politics the line between " making " and " taking " is not a racial line			1
the biggest government program we have , @entity67 , benefits a population that is 85 % white			2
president @entity30 was not re-elected by people who want to " take			1
" the president was re-elected by people who want to work -- and who were convinced , rightly or wrongly , that the president 's policies were more likely to create work than were the policies advocated by my party			1
the @entity4 did not vote for socialism			1
it could not do so , because neither party offers socialism			1
both parties champion a free enterprise economy cushioned by a certain amount of social insurance			1
the @entity86 ( mostly ) want more social insurance ; the @entity88 want less			1
national politics is a contest to move the line of scrimmage , in a game where there 's no such thing as a forward pass , only a straight charge ahead at the defensive line			2
to gain three yards is a big play			2
whatever you think of the @entity30 record , it 's worth keeping in mind that by any measure , free enterprise has been winning the game for a long , long time to this point			1
compare the @entity4 of 2012 with the @entity4 of 1962			2
leave aside the obvious points about segregation and discrimination , and look only at the economy			0
in 1962 , the government regulated the price and route of every airplane , every freight train , every truck and every merchant ship in the @entity4			0
the government regulated the price of natural gas			0
it regulated the interest on every checking account and the commission on every purchase or sale of stock			0
owning a gold bar was a serious crime that could be prosecuted under the @entity131			0
the top rate of income tax was 91 %			0
opinion : how progress is possible in second term it was illegal to own a telephone			0
phones had to be rented from the giant government - regulated monopoly that controlled all telecommunications in the @entity4			0
all young men were subject to the military draft and could escape only if they entered a government - approved graduate course of study			0
the great concern of students of @entity4 society -- of liberals such as @entity152 , of conservatives such as @entity154 and of radicals such as @entity156 -- was the country 's stultifying , crushing conformity			1
even if you look only at the experiences of white heterosexual men , the @entity4 of 2012 is a freer country in almost every way than the @entity4 of 1962			0
@entity30 has changes in mind that conservatives and @entity88 will oppose			1
he will want to raise taxes ; he will want to sustain social spending at a permanently higher level ; he has in mind new regulations over health care , energy production and banking			1
he 'll win some ; he 'll lose some			0
to the extent that his wins prove injurious , future @entity88 congresses and administrations will struggle to undo them			0
that 's politics : a contest that never ends and in which the only certainty is the certainty of constant change			0
the @entity88 challenge next is to reassemble a new coalition for limited government and private enterprise			0
that coalition must include @entity4 of all ethnicities			0
to assume from the start that only certain ethnicities will contribute , and that others aspire only to grab , is not only ugly prejudice ; it is also self - destructive delusion			0
opinion : vote over , but election dysfunction remains people of all backgrounds want to create , save and contribute to society			1
a party of the center - right should make them all feel at home , regardless of how they pronounce their last name , the complexion of their skin or the way in which they express love and build family			0
the @entity213 deems despair a mortal sin			0
to abandon hope is to reject the reality of goodness and to forswear future action			0
the @entity4 is a great and good country , and it remains great and good even when we do not get all our own way politically			0
the @entity4 is a tolerant and free country , which means that there are no " tipping points " beyond which it becomes impossible to correct mistakes			0
fifty years ago , @entity224 was still a live intellectual force in @entity226 universities			0
marxists taught that human society must inevitably evolve into a socialist dictatorship of the proletariat			0
the great @entity226 conservative historian @entity231 scoffed at this arrogance			0
he said , " when radicals scream that victory is indubitably theirs , sensible conservatives knock them on the nose			1
it is only very feeble conservatives who take such words as true and run round crying for the last sacraments			1
" we need more sensible conservatives			1
as for the feeble conservatives , they should take a couple of aspirin and then stay quietly indoors until the temper has subsided and they are ready to say and do something useful again			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .			1

@entity248 says conservatives are *brooding* over the loss of the election
he says some see it as the whites being outnumbered by minorities who want *handouts*
@entity261 : @entity30 was not re-elected by people who wanted to take but by those who want to work
both parties favor social programs to varying degrees , he says , but socialism not in offing
