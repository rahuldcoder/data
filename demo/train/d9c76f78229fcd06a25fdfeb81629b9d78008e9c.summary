@entity0 admitted to using performance - enhancing drugs in an interview with @entity3 that aired thursday night			1
did he use @entity4 ? testosterone ? cortisone ? human growth hormone ? illegal blood transfusions and other blood doping ? @entity0 answered " yes " on all counts			1
in october , the @entity10 released more than 1,000 pages of evidence in doping allegations against @entity0 and his teammates			1
he was stripped of his seven @entity16 titles in the scandal			0
on thursday , the @entity18 demanded that he give back the bronze medal he won in 2000			0
the charges against @entity0 are all too common in the cycling world			1
cyclist @entity22 was stripped of his 2006 @entity16 title after failing a drug test			0
eighty percent of the @entity16 medalists between 1996 and 2010 have been " similarly tainted by doping , " according to the @entity10 report on @entity0			1
a look at the drugs @entity0 used : blood doping @entity4 , or erythropoietin , is a hormone naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production , according to the @entity34			1
cyclists and other athletes use @entity4 to raise their red blood cell counts , which increases the amount of oxygen that can be delivered to muscles , improving recovery and endurance			1
although @entity4 has been banned since the 1990s , the first screening test was used at the @entity44 in @entity45			1
blood transfusions have a similar effect on the body 's red blood cell count			1
usually an athlete will store some of his blood when his hemoglobin levels are high , then reinfuse it right before an event			1
this type of transfusion can not be detected by current tests , according to the @entity10			0
both methods can have dangerous side effects			0
increased levels of hemoglobin , which literally thickens the blood , can lead to complications with circulation , putting athletes at risk for cardiovascular problems			1
corticosteroids corticosteroids are man - made drugs that resemble the natural hormone cortisol , according to the @entity72			0
these are different from anabolic steroids , which athletes take to increase strength			2
the most common types are cortisone , prednisone and methylprednisolone			0
cortisol is most commonly known as a stress hormone			0
corticosteroids work to decrease inflammation that can cause swelling and pain , according to the @entity72			1
they can be administered locally -- to the specific area that hurts -- or systemically through a pill or intravenously			0
the list of possible side effects for corticosteroids is long , including weight gain , sudden mood swings , blurred vision , osteoporosis and high blood pressure			2
" if steroid use involves high doses and is prolonged ( for a few months to several years ) , an increase in the number of side effects might occur , " the clinic 's site states			2
testosterone testosterone is a naturally occurring hormone that helps regulate bone density , fat distribution , muscle strength , red blood cell production and sex drive , according to the @entity112			1
it is found in both men and women ; in men , it also helps to regulate sperm production			0
athletes generally abuse testosterone to " bulk up , " according to the @entity10			2
the side effects are similar to both blood doping and anabolic steroid use			2
testosterone increases the body 's red blood cell count , increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease			1
mood swings , muscle weakness and liver dysfunction are also common for both sexes with overuse			0
using testosterone also shuts down the body 's natural production of the hormone			2
this can cause the testicles to shrink in men , reducing sperm production			0
moving forward cyclists say @entity0 's confession and calls to clean up the sport may lead to a new era			1
" from day one , we always hoped this investigation would bring to a close this troubling chapter in cycling 's history and we hope the sport will use this tragedy to prevent it from ever happening again , " @entity10 ceo @entity148 said in a statement in october			0
" our mission is to protect clean athletes by preserving the integrity of competition not only for today 's athletes but also the athletes of tomorrow			0
we have heard from many athletes who have faced an unfair dilemma -- dope , or do n't compete at the highest levels of the sport			2
many of them abandoned their dreams and left sport because they refused to endanger their health and participate in doping			0
that is a tragic choice no athlete should have to make			0
" what did you think of @entity3 's interview with @entity0 ?			2

@entity0 admits to using @entity4 , blood transfusions and testosterone
@entity4 and blood transfusions increase red blood cell count to raise oxygen levels
@entity0 is also accused of using *cortiocosteroids* to decrease inflammation
