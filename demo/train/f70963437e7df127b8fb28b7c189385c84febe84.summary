after an investigation , @entity51 authorities " decided to leniently forgive and release him , taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrong doings into consideration , " the state - run @entity71 said			1
during an interview with @entity51 authorities , @entity49 reportedly told investigators that " he was taken in by the false rumor spread by the @entity82 and committed a criminal act in the end			1

" i think his point was that certainly your goal is to win , but it 's the process that you take in order to get there , the will to win , the will to prepare -- doing everything in your control in order to put yourself in position to win at anything			0
and i think that 's what his point was , more so than win at all costs , even if you 've got to cheat or cut corners , " @entity108 told the @entity111			0
@entity111 : saints have a @entity108 , and now they want a trophy @entity139 : " staying true " by @entity140 , who in december filed for divorce from @entity142 gov. @entity140 , will be available in bookstores friday			0

rather than standing by their men , wives of morally challenged politicians are now publicly opting to let their husbands clean up their own messes			0
that is one reason why former investment banker @entity139 wrote her book , publisher @entity156 says on its web site			2
" she chose to let @entity140 deal with the embarrassment and political fallout from his own actions while focusing her own efforts privately on raising their children to be men of character , even in the face of the lies their father has told , " says the synopsis of her book on the site			2
@entity0 : silent no more , wives go public about husbands ' affairs @entity181 : @entity182 in @entity58 announced this week that @entity181 has won the $ 100,000 @entity183 for his book " @entity185			1

according to the @entity188 , @entity181 was born in 1963 in @entity189 , @entity190			1
when he was teaching at @entity191 , he noticed that many of his students wrote poems that somehow fit the size of the page they were working on , so he began experimenting with his students			0
what difference would it make if words were written on a candlestick or a roll of toilet paper ? when he wrote the first poem for his book , " tea , " he turned his legal pad sideways and began writing longer lines of poetry			2
@entity181 receives his prize this april			1
here 's an excerpt from his poem , " chronic : " i carry the same baffled heart i have always carried / a bit more battered than before , a bit less joy / for i see the difficult charge of living in this declining sphere / by the open air , i swore out my list of pleasures : / sprig of lilac , scent of pine / the sparrows bathing in the drainage ditch ... " @entity182 : @entity181 wins @entity183 @entity188 : poet biography @entity232 : " @entity185 " what makes a person intriguing ? there are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new , important or different			1
others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect			0
and there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news			0
some of these people do what we expect of them : they run for office , pass legislation , start a business , get hired or fired , commit a crime , make an arrest , get in accidents , hit a home run , overthrow a government , fight wars , sue an opponent , put out fires , prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses			0
they do make news , but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story			0
but every day , there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character , how they reached their decision , how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in			0
we hear about them and want to know more			0
what they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country			0
at times , there is even a mystery about them			0
what they have done may be unique , heroic , cowardly or ghastly , but they capture our imaginations			0
we want to know what makes them tick , why they believe what they do , and why they did what they did			0
