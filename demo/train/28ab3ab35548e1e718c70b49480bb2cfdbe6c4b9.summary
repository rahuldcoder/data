-- if it were not for the powerful stench and desperate shouts emanating from the wire cages , the men sitting in rows , each wearing a white skull cap , look like they could be at a prayer meeting			2
but for the 276 @entity12 men sitting on the floor of two cells designed to hold just 15 people each , their situation is about as far away from a mosque as it gets -- that was the scene , vividly described and shown in an a report by @entity19 news network and @entity0 affiliate , @entity20			1
appearing to have barely enough room to sit , some of the men reportedly had swollen feet and withered leg muscles from a lack of exercise and had not moved from the cage in five months			0
according to a new report from @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , the men are among 1,700 ethnic @entity12 from @entity31 -- formerly known as @entity31 -- who are being held in appalling conditions in @entity35 immigration detention centers in @entity35 's @entity37 province and filmed secretly by the news team from @entity20			1
tens of thousands of ethnic @entity12 from @entity31 's @entity40 have already fled persecution amid ongoing sectarian violence between the majority @entity43 and the @entity45			1
many flee in small , unseaworthy boats arriving in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity35			2
some never make it to their destinations			0
last month , a boat carrying about 100 @entity12 capsized off western @entity31 and at least 50 were feared drowned			1
@entity30 says the overcrowded conditions are part of an unsanctioned policy of deterring @entity12 from seeking asylum in @entity35			1
@entity57 : what 's behind sectarian violence in @entity31 ? " i think that the @entity35 policy is all about saying to the @entity12 , ' hey , if you land in @entity35 you 're not going to have an easy time of it ' , " @entity60 , deputy director of the @entity62 division of @entity30 , told @entity0			1
" by putting people in detention centers in these appalling conditions the @entity35 government is effectively saying come here at your own peril			1
" opinion : two - child policy in @entity31 will increase bloodshed @entity30 says @entity35 immigration officials have not permitted @entity77 , the @entity78 ' refugee agency , to conduct refugee status determination screenings and have split up the @entity12 families with women and children sent to government - run shelters			1
according to the @entity20 report , while the women and children are held in better conditions than the men , they often have no information about the status or even whereabouts of their partners			2
" the government should immediately allow them to pursue their asylum claims with the @entity78 refugee agency , " said @entity62 director @entity94 , adding that under the @entity96 , everyone has the right to seek asylum from persecution			0
@entity30 also claimed that under @entity35 's " help on " policy -- whereby @entity106 vessels that intercept @entity12 boats supply them with fuel and provisions on condition the boats sail onward to @entity48 and @entity49 -- @entity45 were being put at further risk			1
" @entity35 authorities should provide temporary protection to @entity12 and scrap the ' help on ' policy that places these asylum seekers in harm 's way , " @entity94 said			1
" the government should help @entity45 who escape from oppression and hardship in @entity31 -- not worsen their plight			0
" but @entity126 , spokesman for the @entity35 @entity127 , told @entity0 that @entity35 authorities were fully aware of and concerned about overcrowding at its existing immigration facilities			0
" since january , various groups of @entity12 have been placed under the care of various immigration and detention centers and government shelters across @entity35 , that notwithstanding , alternative arrangements are being identified as a matter of priority to address the issue of overcrowding , as well as in reuniting those @entity12 with their family members			2
" he denied the government was not cooperating with international bodies over the issue , saying the government was working in close partnership with humanitarian agencies such as the @entity77 , @entity149 and the @entity150 to provide temporary assistance to the refugees			0
he added that their asylum rights would be fully respected			0
" @entity35 has not been denying anyone , their basic human rights , he said			0
" in fact @entity35 is providing temporary assistance and shelters in spite the fact that these @entity12 are illegal migrants			2
furthermore , international organizations such as @entity77 , @entity150 , @entity164 and @entity149 have access to these people on the regular basis			0
" @entity35 's prime minister @entity168 agreed in january to permit @entity45 arriving by boat in @entity35 to stay temporarily , initially for six months , until they could be safely repatriated or resettled in a third country			0
" the @entity35 government is in close cooperation with various countries and international organizations to find a durable solution for the @entity12 , " said @entity126			2
" the six - month period announced in january is a tentative time frame and we are examining various possibilities			0
" critics fear that if the @entity35 government is unable to find a third country that would accept the asylum seekers , then @entity35 may deport the @entity12 back to @entity31 where they would undoubtedly face persecution			1
