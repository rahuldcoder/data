-- slavery is the most abhorrent chapter in @entity4 's history			1
everyone knows it happened , but few people know much about it or want to think about it			2
which means that it 's not exactly something that pops up with regularity in popular entertainment -- even though slavery 's legacy , 150 years after the @entity15 , is still very much with us			1
this makes the release of " @entity21 " something of a major historical - cultural event			1
the film , which opens friday with an a-list cast -- @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 -- is based on the memoir of @entity30 , a free black man kidnapped in 1841 in @entity31 and sold into slavery in @entity33			1
uncompromising and extremely violent , " 12 years " refuses to downplay the racism , brutality and crude @entity37 mindset that typified the " peculiar institution			0
" this is not " @entity40 , " which was a blend of spaghetti @entity42 , @entity44 flick and whatever else popped into @entity46 's genre - fevered brain			2
and it 's not last year 's " @entity48 , " a film that was about emancipation but was so genteel in its approach , it skipped the part about plantation culture			1
' the @entity55 ' reflects @entity4 's racial conversations " @entity21 " is easily the most hard - hitting portrayal of slavery since the 1977 tv blockbuster " roots			1
" it is the kind of film that many people will avoid , in part because of its depiction of everything from the surrealism of slave markets to whippings , rapes , hangings and the myriad ways in which slave owners terrorized and ruled over their property			1
it 's also a movie that @entity4 need to see , if they are to better understand their country			1
it 's an uncomfortable reminder that the legacy of this once deeply rooted institution continues to resonate in our society , whether it is the current fight over voter id laws in states like @entity82 and @entity83 that disproportionately affect minorities ; the fact that the @entity87 incarceration rate , fueled by years of poverty and racism , is six times the national average , and the unemployment rate for blacks is double that of whites ; or the continued high rate of out - of - wedlock births among contemporary black women			1
a country that refuses to confront its past is a country in denial			1
" @entity21 " startles the viewer like a slap in the face , and the film is even more astonishing since it is the work of @entity104 , a black @entity105 director who said during a press conference at the @entity107 that he was particularly interested in the subject because it " is about how to survive an unfortunate situation			1
" yet he also admitted that " i made this movie because i want to tell a story about slavery and a story that has n't been given a platform in cinema			2
... if that starts a conversation , wonderful			0
" that conversation has long been virtually ignored by the mass media , which has treated the subject of slavery as if it were the bastard child of @entity87 history rather than an original sin that must be faced			2
for most of the last century , movies and tv in the @entity128 era , always sensitive to race issues and how they might affect box office in the @entity131 , either ignored slavery or sugar - coated it			1
films like " @entity135 , " for example , glamorized the @entity134			0
the harsh realities of field work were almost never shown , most slave owners were benevolent , and slaves , most of whom tended to work in the big house , were basically ordinary servants ( who could be bought and sold at will and worked without pay , of course ) , devoted to their masters			0
when that story was n't enough , the most lurid aspects of the slave trade were front and center -- in particular , interracial sex between slave and master , depicted in films like " @entity154 , " " @entity155 " and 1957 's " @entity156 , " in which good - guy slave master @entity157 buys beautiful mulatto @entity159 and then falls in love with her			0
needless to say , none of these films bothered to fully explore the political and power dynamics involved			0
must - see @entity87 movies of the 21st century " roots " helped changed the narrative			0
the massively popular miniseries followed the slave @entity171 ( played by @entity172 ) from his @entity87 home to the @entity174 , a @entity176 slave auction and plantation life in @entity178			0
it featured an aborted slave revolt , whippings , torture , rape and other horrors			0
but despite roots ' enormous audience ( the final episode was watched by 100 million people ) the subject of slavery did not return soon			2
when filmmakers did try to address it , they were met with indifference - films like " @entity195 , " " beloved " and " glory " drew critical praise but failed to gain much traction at the box office			0
will " @entity21 " change all that ? already critically praised and the winner of the @entity203 at the @entity107 , the film is being touted as a serious @entity205 contender			1
yet whether moviegoers beyond the art house crowd will continue to duck @entity104 's " conversation " and this lesson in @entity87 depravity is another matter altogether			0
" @entity21 " tells us how we got to where we are today racially			1
it is not a story that @entity221 flag wavers , states ' rights advocates , talk radio stalwarts and all too many other @entity4 want to entertain			2
i can just hear them saying " @entity224 ended 150 years ago			0
" it did , and it did n't			0
and that 's the point			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			2

@entity230 : slavery a stain on @entity4 , but few people want to know much about it
he says it 's essential to confront this past to understand how slavery 's legacy is still with us
the film " @entity21 " is brutal , *unstintingly* realistic . few movies have dared to be
@entity230 : the film tells us how we got to where we are today racially . will people watch ?
