-- as i walked the streets of @entity3 the other day , i saw several white youths with hoodies , tattoos and nose rings			2
not one time did it enter my mind that they could be skinheads			1
while walking into the @entity13 in @entity14 earlier that day , a few african - americans rocked various types of hoodies			2
there was n't a knot in my stomach ; i did n't cross the street out of fear , and no , i did n't nervously look around for a cop or two			2
as a native of @entity24 , i grew up in a black neighborhood			1
went to a black church			1
i 've seen every kind of black person possible			1
and never have i walked in fear of black folks who have given me no reason to be scared			1
oh , let 's be clear , i 've seen a group of menacing looking black folks who scared the hell out of me			1
but i can say the same for whites , hispanics and @entity46			2
what the @entity48 shooting should tell us is that the stereotypes that we have of people can have deadly consequences			1
@entity48 was nothing more than a young man wearing athletic shoes , jeans and a hoodie			1
for @entity60 , that 's the uniform of a suspicious person			1
and it apparently was that simple observation that led @entity60 to follow @entity48 in his car , get out , confront @entity48 and eventually shoot him fatally			1
it has been amazing to listen to the reaction of some folks			2
but nothing got me more charged up than hearing @entity70 say on " @entity71 " that by wearing a hoodie , @entity48 contributed to his own death			1
" when you see a kid walking down the street , particularly a dark - skinned kid like my son @entity78 â € ” who i constantly yelled at when he was going out wearing a damn hoodie or those pants around his ankles			1
' take that hood off ! ' people look at you and what 's the instant identification , what 's the instant association ? it 's those crime scene surveillance tapes , " @entity70 said			1
" every time you see someone stickin ' up a 7 - 11 , the kid 's wearing a hoodie			1
every time you see a mugging on a surveillance camera or they get the old lady in the alcove , it 's a kid wearing a hoodie			1
you have to recognize that this whole stylizing yourself as a ' gangsta			2
' ... you 're gon na be a gangsta wan na ? well , people are going to perceive you as a menace			1
it is an instant reflexive action			2
" he later added , " when you see a black or @entity117 youngster , particularly on the street , you walk to the other side of the street			1
you try to avoid that confrontation			0
@entity48 , you know , @entity123 bless him , he was an innocent kid , a wonderful kid , a box of @entity125 in his hands			1
he did n't deserve to die			0
but i 'll bet you money , if he did n't have that hoodie on , that nutty neighborhood watch guy would n't have responded in that violent and aggressive way			1
" he might have thought he was well - meaning , but @entity70 , that 's just nonsense			1
it was n't @entity48 's hoodie that led to his death ; it was the skin color			1
it was what was going through @entity60 's mind when he saw the kid			1
we do a disservice to ourselves when we try to explain away such nonsense			0
in a show of solidarity , all the @entity142 took a photo wearing the team 's hoodies , with their hands stuffed in their pockets			1
the leader of this effort was my good friend , @entity150			0
@entity150 also posted a picture of himself in a hoodie on his @entity155 page and linked to it from @entity157 tagged with " # hoodies # stereotypes # trayvonmartin " " i 'm a father , " @entity150 told the @entity159			1
" it 's support of the tragic thing that has taken place			1
no matter what color , race , we 're all fathers			0
" the problem today is that minorities , especially men -- black men -- have long had to make accommodations for the negative view others have of us			2
see , it does n't matter about our degrees			0
our fine , tailored suits do n't matter			0
we 've made all the accommodations to fit into this society			0
we 've cut our hair			0
we are careful about the clothes we wear			0
we change how we talk so as not to sound threatening			0
we 're fine , upstanding citizens			0
yet we still are seen as suspicious			0
and in the case of @entity48 , end up dead			1
we are sick and tired of being seen as suspicious			0
we are sick and tired of being seen as a stereotype and not as a full human being			0
we are sick and tired of having to give our black boys " the talk " and still having to bury them so young			2
as civil rights activist @entity184 stated so well : " we are sick and tired of being sick and tired			0
" for those who continue to tout this so - called post-racial @entity186 , look at the image of @entity48			1
you tell his parents that the age of @entity191 is a post-racial @entity186			0
you tell his parents , @entity193 and @entity194 , that their son was judged by the content of his character and not the color of his skin			0
even president @entity191 said on friday that the killing of @entity48 requires a national " soul - searching			1
" " if i had a son , he 'd look like @entity204 , " president @entity191 said			0
we will no longer accommodate your easily bruised feelings by clenching our teeth and praying it will all get better			0
what do we want ? justice			0
when do we want it ? now			0
if you think for a moment that we will be satisfied with a police chief stepping down or press releases expressing outrage , you have another think coming			0
@entity218 , folks , is war			0
this is war on racism			2
this is war on bigotry			2
this is war on stereotypes			2
this is a call to arms			0
this is time for the soldiers in the battle for social justice to stand up and say , " i report for duty , sir			2
" this fight will not become just a moment			2
we will not let that happen			0
this incident is about a movement			0
a movement to be treated equally , and not be stalked and stereotyped because of the amount of melanin in our skin			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			0

@entity48 : stereotypes that we have of people can have deadly consequences
a black youth should not be a target just because he wears a hoodie , @entity48 says
@entity48 says it 's time to renew the fight against racism , bigotry and stereotypes
