-- in @entity2 , high - speed rail has come to stand for ease and efficiency with point - to - point city center travel where journeys of four hours or less trump airplanes and the hassle of airport security			1
deregulation of the rail industry across the continent has also cemented trains as a viable alternative to short haul flights			1
" airlines have already pulled out of certain routes -- they 've given up competing between @entity21 and @entity22 or between @entity21 and @entity23 , " says @entity17 founder of rail website @entity16			2
" airlines have been given a run for their money on routes like @entity28 to @entity29 , @entity30 to @entity31			2
they 're going to have to retrench and go back to further long distance routes and not even try and compete on some of the short haul they do at the moment			0
" the airline industry has already seen an increase in competition and choice across the continent			2
@entity42 , @entity2 's fourth largest high - speed market after the @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , according to @entity47 , saw its first privately owned rail company @entity48 break state - owned @entity51 's monopoly with its red @entity48 " @entity53 trains "			1
" this privatization and competition drives more efficient businesses " says @entity54 , president of @entity48			0
" with more efficient businesses those benefits and savings can be passed on the customers			0
so service gets better , product gets better and pricing gets better			0

the company recently invested $ 100m in upgrades to its fleet of high - speed trains , adding free @entity73 and new features like a conference room in a business carriage			1
" this is very positive because it is offering ecological solutions to the consumer so anybody investing in the train industry is very good for us , " he says			0
however cross-border travel in @entity2 is not as easy as it could be with different systems in place for each country and no central booking system			1
@entity90 is one company that is trying to make the online reservation system more user - friendly , building an online rail ticket network of four of @entity2 's rail operators : @entity96 's @entity95 , @entity98 's sj rail operator , @entity99 in the @entity44 and the @entity102 countries ' @entity100			1
" rail is actually pretty challenging to book , " says @entity103 , vice-president of @entity104 at @entity90			0
" each company has a very different tech space			0
it 's very difficult for online travel agencies			0
" new rules in @entity2 have opened up the $ 80 billion rail travel market allowing operators to expand beyond their domestic platforms			1
only 6 % of high - speed rail in @entity2 is currently cross-border and only a fifth of tickets are booked on the internet			1
rail operators are starting to realize their online potential			0

" global distribution systems could take their content and distribute it to hundreds of thousands of travel operators and online travel agents			0
" cross-border rail in @entity2 will be fully liberalized to include domestic as well as international passengers in 2019			2
in @entity45 , rail operator @entity136 is preparing for increased competition by launching the first ever low - cost , high speed train			1
there 's no food or drink sold onboard and prices start at around $ 32 from @entity21 to @entity142 and @entity143 via @entity23			0
" @entity146 and the introduction of competition ( means ) we need to have a low price system " says @entity144 , chairman of @entity136			2
" some people would like to have a lot of flexibility , a lot of services and comfort			0
but other ones they just want the price			0
" @entity45 was the second country after @entity158 to introduce high - speed rail and @entity144 believes it is crucial that the company still leads the way in innovation			1
quiz : test your knowledge of airline liveries " we are pioneers in that field			0
if ( low - cost , high - speed rail ) is a success i can imagine for cross-border lines the next years there will be opportunities to go to @entity22 and @entity177 , and perhaps from and to @entity178 and to @entity96			1
" however @entity179 remains realistic about the industry 's future where there will be increased competition , but also more collaboration			2
" if there is room for several different operators on routes , let 's compete			0
some other routes there is not so much potential -- @entity193 to @entity142 -- so let 's do the service together between @entity196 and @entity136 so customers can just change trains without changing their tickets			0
" the aim is to make journeys as seamless as possible and even join rail to the end of long - haul flights			1
" you can fly from @entity206 to @entity193 or from @entity207 to @entity208 and then connect to the high - speed train , " says @entity144			1
" the high speed system will be connected to airports -- look at the new stations -- @entity193 is connected to the high speed line , @entity23 is connected			2
" if high speed rail can effectively feed into long haul air networks and take over short haul routes , it wo n't just connect the dots in @entity2 but build alliances with airlines as well .			1

deregulation of national rail networks in @entity2 means greater competition and collaboration
new high - speed routes opening across the continent
aim to have seamless travel between large cities and countries
