-- in the last decade of the 20th century , the @entity2 lira fell in value 1,000 times against the @entity6 dollar , meaning that tourists returning to that country after several years found that any old money they still possessed since their last visit had become almost worthless			1
now as fears grow about whether @entity13 will stay in the euro , and the possible domino effect this could cause , many prospective holidaymakers appear to be having second thoughts about visiting that country and other economically troubled members of the 17 - nation eurozone , such as @entity20 or @entity21			1
and while tourists may be bulking up their cash reserves in the case of a euro exit , others may be concerned about safety if violent street protests resume against austerity cuts			1
what is the financial situation now ? political deadlock is leading to fears that @entity13 will not have a government in place when it needs to make critical debt payments , which could in turn jeopardize its place in the eurozone			1
on monday , @entity13 withdrew up to € 800 million from @entity13 banks , and the threat of a banking panic heightened concern of a default			1
fears of contagion spilled over into bond markets in @entity20 and @entity47			0
the idea that has investors around the globe worried is the so - called " @entity51 " -- or @entity13 exit from the eurozone -- a tricky scenario that is now looking like a real possibility			1
@entity57 bookmakers @entity56 stopped taking bets after gamblers lined up to put money on it last week			0
other betting companies are giving odds on @entity13 leaving the euro as low as 1/10 , while the odds on @entity20 leaving are about 6/1			1
what effect is uncertainty having on tourism within the eurozone ? many in the travel industry admit bookings to @entity13 are lower than in previous years , with other countries benefiting			1
hotel reservations on popular holiday destinations such as @entity76 and @entity77 are down by up to 50 % compared to the same period before last month 's indecisive election , according to the @entity79			0
@entity80 of the @entity81 blames some inaccurate coverage of concerns about @entity13 's financial problems as a factor			2
" this is having a positive effect on @entity20 travel , for example , with bookings higher than normal , " he told @entity0			0
" travelers are advised to take spending money in cash , as in the event of @entity13 leaving the euro there may be questions about whether you could still pay by credit or debit cards			2
" despite tourism contributing about $ 10,5 billion , or about 16 % of @entity13 's gross domestic product , officials brushed off concerns			2
" there was also a financial crisis in @entity13 last year as well and we had a record year with a 10 % increase in the number of visitors , " said @entity104 , president of the @entity105			2
" because of the crisis , early booking are down around @entity114 at the moment			0
however , @entity13 is a beautiful and safe country so we are optimistic that tourism wo n't be strongly affected			2
" in the longer term , if @entity13 does leave the euro , it could mean it becomes a much cheaper country to visit , as @entity122 's biggest travel company @entity120 pointed out			1
" we believe there are positives and negatives for the travel industry in the event that @entity13 were to leave the euro , " the firm said			1
should tourists be worried about buying euros for foreign travel ? on the face of it , tourists have n't had it so good for a long time : the euro is at a three - year low against the @entity122 pound and is as weak against the @entity6 dollar as it has been since 2010			1
this should mean the cost of hotels and restaurants is lower than it has been for a few years			0
travel experts say that whatever happens with @entity13 and the euro this summer , tourists visiting economically troubled @entity114 countries , such as @entity13 , @entity47 , @entity20 and @entity21 -- all major tourist destinations -- are unlikely to lose out			1
if @entity13 does leave the euro this could lead to contagion , and other countries joining them , but few analysts believe the whole euro project is likely to collapse in the next year or so			1
in other words , it 's safe to buy euros , but keep an eye on the exchange rate , which is continuing to strengthen in favor of world currencies			0
how can travelers ensure they do n't lose out ? travel writer @entity166 said he planned to visit @entity13 this summer , and was taking two precautions			1
" the first was to add an extra € 100 to my estimated spending , " @entity166 wrote on his blog			0
" normally i rely on plastic for emergencies , but were @entity13 to leave the euro , electronic banking could freeze for up to a week and prevent debit and credit card transactions			2
" next , i insisted on € 5 , € 10 and € 20 notes			0
if @entity13 leaves the euro , the most likely interim currency is the existing euro overprinted with a @entity13 delta symbol ( for " drachma " ) , or possibly with a corner clipped			2
" the value of the @entity13 euro would fall by perhaps 40 per cent			2
while traders sort themselves out , and before a market in the @entity13 currency begins , tourists are likely to pay in euros but be given change in new money			1
pay for a € 15 round of drinks with a € 50 note , and you could get back change in @entity13 currency worth only € 20			0
that is why low - denomination notes are so useful			0
" do street protests against austerity cuts mean @entity13 or another country is unsafe ? no. there have been occasional protests in big cities , such as @entity207 and @entity208 , but most say @entity13 remains safe			1
posts on online forums were scathing about what they said was the media blowing the unrest out of proportion , although there are some warnings that strikes could disrupt travel into and around the country			0
@entity81 's @entity80 said " there 's an element of concern about personal safety with sporadic unrest in @entity207 , but most places where tourists visit are safe			0
" in reality this is one of the best times to visit @entity13 , as prices should come down , thanks to supply and demand			0
" @entity122 travel firm @entity120 said it was " closely monitoring the evolving situation in @entity207			0
most of our holidaymakers are on the country 's islands where you 'd never know anything was going on			0

some holidaymakers appear to be having second thoughts about visiting @entity13
others concerned about safety if violent street protests resume against austerity cuts
