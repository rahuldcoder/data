-- president @entity2 's re-election campaign is spending record amounts of money for online advertising and more than twice as much as his @entity7 rival , a @entity0 analysis of campaign finance data shows			1
in the first few months of 2012 , @entity2 's campaign bought nearly $ 16.4 million worth of online ads after spending almost $ 2.2 million last year -- even though he did n't face a @entity13 challenger			1
that means he is on pace to spend a record amount on digital ads , according to ad spending experts			0
the campaign for @entity20 , who survived a heated primary race to become the presumptive @entity7 nominee , spent $ 7.8 million for online ads this year , in addition to the $ 500,000 it spent in 2011			1
the numbers are compiled by the @entity26 from reports by the campaigns			0
@entity29 , digital director for @entity20 's campaign , predicted online ad spending would pick up for both camps as the general election contest kicks into high gear			1
" we plan to do a ton more now that the primaries are over , " he said			0
the @entity2 campaign wo n't comment on its digital strategy			2
@entity29 said that while tv ads are like hitting voters over the head with a hammer , internet ads are more like using a scalpel			2
@entity2 's campaign going to the dogs -- and cats and chickens when it comes to reaching specific voters , @entity29 said , " you can be a lot more precise with your message online			1
" plus , compared with broadcast , online ads are cheaper and easier to track			1
" we can show the value of a particular message right away by seeing who clicks through or who spends time with a particular message , " he said			0
" we can immediately demonstrate its value , and we have hard numbers to show a person 's engagement			0
" in theory , such targeted ads can help the candidates better engage with the key voters they need in what 's sure to be a close election : the elusive swing state independents , the coveted @entity77 groups , the @entity73 who vacillate between @entity7 and @entity13			1
the campaigns buy ad space on sites such as @entity81 to reach @entity77 groups and @entity83 to find the @entity73 who could vote either way , and look for independents on general news sites such as @entity0 or e-mail sites such as @entity88 " they can find where these coveted voters specifically are online and get their message to them , " said @entity89 , senior editor for @entity90 , a trade publication that covers the digital advertising industry , and author of " campaign ' 08 : a turning point for @entity100			2
" " it 's a major advantage			0
" @entity29 also noted that @entity20 's campaign , like @entity2 's , has posted multiple videos to @entity104 and @entity105 to reach people who do n't watch tv much			1
there 's another strong advantage to online video ads : you generally ca n't fast - forward through them like you can if you use a dvr to watch tv			2
both campaigns have already spent millions on tv ads. the @entity2 campaign spent nearly $ 13.3 million from january 19 to may 22 , while the @entity20 campaign spent more than $ 15 million from november 22 to may 22 , according to @entity118 , which tracks political ad spending			1
online , the @entity20 campaign has spent much of its early money on @entity123 search terms			1
type in " @entity128 , " @entity20 's father , and an ad for his son appears on the top of the page			1
" mayor @entity133 " pulls up a " stand with @entity133 " ad from the @entity132 criticizing @entity2			2
the @entity2 campaign is doing the same on @entity123 , but ad buys for both sides may change , as the political debate shifts			2
when " @entity139 " was a hot topic a few weeks back , a @entity123 search turned up a link to @entity141			0
that ad has since disappeared now that the term is no longer in the news			0
@entity20 's online campaign seems pretty traditional so far			1
@entity147 's name into @entity148 , a visual ad search site , and 20 ads appear , most with a simple message such as " stand with @entity20 , " " ready to lead " or " @entity152			1
" in many of the ads , the candidate stands alone smiling confidently , looking off into the distance			0
prove @entity20 's not a unicorn , group says in satirizing ' birthers ' " what he is trying to do here is essentially show @entity20 is the strong leader , implying that @entity2 is the weaker leader , " said @entity160 , an @entity161 psychology professor who wrote " @entity162 , " a book about the role of emotion in deciding elections			1
for now , @entity20 's ads are most likely to show up online where readers may be sympathetic to his message , or on sites that would catch the attention of voters in a particular primary state			1
according to a @entity0 analysis of @entity179 , which tracks online ad spending , @entity20 's campaign made its largest online ad purchase -- some $ 32,000 -- on @entity182			1
the site had more than 5 million @entity20 ad impressions between january and april			2
his ads also ran on local news sites such as @entity187 in @entity188 and @entity189 in @entity190			0
by comparison , @entity2 's campaign spent the most at @entity193 , paying more than $ 1 million for ads that have appeared on the site more than 238 million times			1
his ads also pop up regularly on general news sites such as @entity0 and the @entity198			0
they also turn up in some unexpected places -- games.com , elyrics.net and match.com			0
the images in the 145 @entity2 online ads that surface on @entity148 stand in stark contrast to @entity20 's			1
most feature first lady @entity206 or the president 's entire family			1
there 's even one that features their dog , @entity214			2
the messages encourage people to " enter to win dinner with @entity2 " or " @entity218 " by clicking the ad			0
" it makes a lot of sense to put @entity206 front and center , " @entity161 's @entity160 said			0
" she is so much more popular than the president is at this point			0
it makes him likable to be associated with her			0
i think @entity20 should be doing more of this , because his wife seems quite likable in a very different way			2
it will be key for @entity20 to share who he is in a real way with voters so they can feel some connection			2
" @entity240 , which tracks ad spending , predicts online ad purchases will make up about 1.5 % of the candidates ' overall campaign ad budgets			0
while that may not sound like much , @entity245 said it would be $ 159 million more than in 2008 -- a sevenfold increase			0
and it 's likely that as technology improves , that number will grow			0
" what tv and radio used to do exclusively is now something , with the improved technology , that online ads can do very well , " @entity89 said			1
" so you can be sure to see a lot more political presence online in the very near future			0

president @entity2 spent $ 16.4 million this year on online ads , twice as much as @entity20
online ads are seen as a better way to target specific voters
@entity20 's ads appear traditional ; @entity2 's feature his family , wife , even his dog
