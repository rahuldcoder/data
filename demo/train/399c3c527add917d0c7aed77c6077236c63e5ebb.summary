@entity0 , @entity1 -- if september 11 , 2001 , was the day everything changed , then april 15 , 2013 , serves as another reminder of that change , of our frailties and of a new reality in which " it ca n't happen here " has been replaced by " it can happen anywhere			1
" when initial reports came out of @entity24 about two explosions occurring near the finish line of the 116th marathon -- a marathon that began with 26 seconds of silence in honor of the 26 victims of the @entity22 massacre -- we held our collective breaths and hoped it was a freak infrastructure accident			0
anything other than ... president @entity30 did not say the word " terrorism " in his brief address , perhaps waiting until more facts are learned			1
we do n't know how many are responsible , we do n't know motive , if any , and we do n't know whether it 's domestic or foreign			1
but we do know the @entity38 said the explosions were well - planned			1
we know the @entity40 is seen around the world			2
and we know three people are dead , including an 8 - year - old boy , more than 100 are injured , and countless lives have been scarred			2
get up - to - the - minute updates on @entity47 's live blog so if september 11 , 2001 , was the day our innocence was taken , then april 15 , 2013 , is the reminder that it is never coming back			1
and we do not need the president to say the word to feel the word			1
it is felt each time we have to take off our shoes at the airport , have an @entity57 officer pat us down , throw away a tube of toothpaste because it 's over the allotted 3.4 ounces			2
the @entity60 temporarily restricted flights over the bombing site while security was increased in cities as far away as @entity65 and @entity66			0
we do not need the president to say the word to feel it			1
i was in central @entity70 earlier this month and was having a difficult time finding a garbage can whenever i had something to discard			0
finally , i asked some of the residents why it was so hard to find one and was reminded that the @entity78 hid bombs in garbage cans during the 1990s and as a result they are still seen as a security threat			2
this is what happens when evil like the kind experienced in @entity24 takes away our innocence			0
it forces us to empty our pockets , have our bags inspected and remove trash cans from the streets of a major international city			0
we do n't need the president to say the word to be reminded constantly that if we see something , we need to say something , blurring the lines between a healthy awareness of our surroundings and irrational paranoia			1
but then again , is our paranoia that irrational if something as celebratory as the @entity40 is no longer a safe place to be ? if september 11 , 2001 , made you cry , then april 15 , 2013 , should make you angry			1
all of the laws , the creation of @entity108 , the trillions spent , the political grandstanding and debates and yet the best we can do is make the country safer			0
we will never , ever be safe again			0
not in the way many of us remember being safe growing up			0
when i 'm in a large crowded space , i check for emergency exits ... and i hate it			0
but like love and good , evil is an omnipresent force imposing itself on the rest of society like an untreatable cancer			0
so while @entity30 telling the @entity125 people those responsible will " feel the full weight of justice , " we are haunted by the fact that " justice " wo n't bring the victims back			1
" justice " wo n't undo the fear embedded in the people who were closest to the blast			2
" justice " wo n't take us back to september 10 , 2001 ... back before the word " terrorism " was on the tip of every @entity125 's tongue			1
and make no mistake , while the president did not use that word in his news conference , that is the word federal authorities are using			1
does n't matter if the culprits of this heinous act came from afar or home			2
the origin of the person or persons responsible wo n't bring us the peace that we took for granted not so long ago			2
that peace is gone , forever			0
our children will hear stories about this peace and our children 's children will treat it as a fairy tale			0
if april 15 , 2013 , was the day the @entity40 became a target for terrorism , then september 11 , 2001 , was the day we all were warned that it would be			1
since then nothing has been the same			0
nothing will be the same			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			1

@entity166 : april 15 , 2013 , bombings a reminder of ever - present threat of terrorism
he says september 11 , 2001 , changed our world ; now we know " safety " is n't going to return
president @entity30 did n't use word " terrorism " but everyone knows that 's what it 's about , he says
