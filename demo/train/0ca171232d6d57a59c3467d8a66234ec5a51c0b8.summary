-- @entity1 , which has n't seen a major hurricane in some seven years , is about to get walloped by @entity3 , which forecasters termed large and dangerous saturday night			1
the eye of the category 2 storm may pass just to the west of the @entity11 island late sunday , sharply increasing the likelihood of damaging winds , forecasters said			1
such a landfall would spare @entity1 " the worst of the storm surge , but will inflict some of the highest wind speeds ... on the island , " said @entity0 meteorologist @entity15			1
" a direct hit would be the worst - case scenario , because the island would have to endure the extremely strong winds in the eyewall , as well as a dangerously high storm surge , " said added			1
the hurricane is currently going through an " eyewall replacement cycle , " and , during this time , accurately forecasting its track becomes more difficult , said @entity26			2
a new eye begins to develop around the old eye of a hurricane during the replacement cycle			0
" fortunately , the forecast is that @entity3 will not strengthen more before approaching @entity1			1
it is expected to maintain category 2 status , " @entity26 added			0

" the winds are definitely a concern , " said @entity0 weather producer @entity39			0
" @entity3 is expected to remain a dangerous hurricane as it approaches @entity1 , " the @entity36 said			1
" @entity3 is a very large hurricane			1
" as of 11 p.m. est saturday , @entity3 was about 285 miles ( 455 km ) south of @entity1 , packing sustained winds of about 100 mph ( 160 kph ) as it headed north - northwest at 13 mph ( 20 kph )			1
@entity36 - force winds extended up to 90 miles ( 150km ) from the center			0
the storm could also produce as much as 9 inches of rainfall over the island , according to the @entity36			2
@entity51 hit @entity1 in 2003 , killing at least four people			2
it came ashore with 120 mph ( 193 kph ) winds			0
large waves generated by the storm were already pounding beaches saturday afternoon , said @entity0 ireporter @entity57			2
" a dangerous storm surge is expected to produce significant coastal flooding on @entity1 , " the @entity36 said			1
" the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves , especially along the southern coast			0
" the weather agency said swells will affect the @entity66 of the @entity67 , @entity68 , the @entity69 , @entity70 and parts of the @entity72 over the weekend			0
" these swells are likely to cause life - threatening surf and rip currents , " the @entity36 said			0
@entity57 , a native @entity1 , spent saturday morning putting up storm blinds on his windows and securing his pets inside the house			1
on friday , he stocked up on bottled water , canned food and batteries			0
he said that despite riding a number of storms out on the island , " this one has my attention thus i am taking it very seriously			0
" @entity57 said he 's most worried about potential damage to the roof of his home , which faces the island 's southern shore -- the frontline for the approaching @entity3 's northerly track			2
" our roofs , which we use to catch our drinking water , can sometimes be vulnerable to high winds and pressure changes , so fingers crossed our roof is ok , " he said			0
meanwhile , @entity103 continued to diminish saturday farther east in the @entity11			0
as of 11 p.m. est , @entity103 's maximum sustained winds were at 50 mph ( 85 kph ) , the @entity36 said			0
