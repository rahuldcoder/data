@entity0 -- president @entity3 told his war council wednesday that the @entity6 troop commitment to @entity7 is not open - ended , and he asked for revisions to options he previously received for sending more troops , a senior administration official told @entity1			1
the war council -- made up of top @entity12 , @entity13 and administration officials -- met with @entity3 for the eighth time to discuss a request by the top @entity6 commander in @entity7 for up to 40,000 more troops			1
the meeting lasted more than two hours , according to the senior administration official			0
" the president and his team discussed the length of time that it would take to implement the options he 's been presented , " the senior official said			2
" the president believes that we need to make clear to the @entity7 government that our commitment is not open - ended			2
after years of substantial investments by the @entity6 people , governance in @entity7 must improve in a reasonable period of time to ensure a successful transition to our @entity7 partner			1
" in particular , @entity3 pushed for revisions in proposed plans for troop increases to clarify how and when @entity6 troops would turn over responsibility to the @entity7 government , the official said			1
the president 's questions at the meeting could change how many troops eventually are sent to @entity7 , as well as how long they would be there , according to the senior administration official			1
before the meeting , gen. @entity51 , the top @entity6 military commander in the @entity52 , said the meeting would continue evaluating how best to carry out the mission in @entity7			1
@entity51 provided no specifics on options under consideration , but said the process is approaching completion			0
" i think we are indeed nearing a decision on this very important topic , " he said , emphasizing the need to focus on the mission of ensuring that @entity7 " does not once again become a sanctuary or safe haven for @entity67 and the kind of transnational extremists that carried out the 9/11 attacks			2
" earlier , a senior administration official and a @entity6 military official independently told @entity1 that one option presented to @entity3 calls for sending about 34,000 more @entity6 troops to @entity7 in addition to the 68,000 already committed to the country			1
the military official said the plan would send three @entity79 brigades , totaling about 15,000 troops ; a @entity82 brigade of about 8,000 troops ; a headquarters element of about 7,000 troops ; and 4,000 to 5,000 support troops			2
the combat brigades would be brought in gradually , in three - month intervals , according to the military official			0
the troops would be spread across the country , mainly focusing in the south and southeast , where much of the fighting is , according to the official			0
the military official said the option has been a favorite at the @entity13 in recent weeks			0
that is only one option , the senior administration official emphasized			0
three other options , the official said , would be " different mixes , " or " different components of it			0
" the senior administration official said @entity3 was expected to ask the war council meeting about cooperation the @entity6 can expect from the government of @entity7 president @entity107 , civilian support the @entity6 is willing to offer , and support the @entity6 can expect from other countries			1
on wednesday night , the @entity110 and the @entity111 reported that concerns have been raised recently by the @entity6 ambassador in @entity114 about @entity107 's ability to rid his country 's government of corruption and mismanagement			1
all those factors could lead to " further refinements " or some " greater elements being considered , " the official said , adding : " he 's got to fine - tune this , put it all together ... for what direction best advances our interests			0
" despite reports to the contrary , @entity3 has not decided the number of @entity6 troops he will send to @entity7 , @entity131 officials said			1
such reports are " absolutely false , " press secretary @entity136 said			0
anyone who suggests otherwise , " does n't have , in all honesty , the slightest idea what they 're talking about			0
" @entity131 officials would not say whether wednesday 's meeting with the war council would be @entity3 's last with that group before deciding on @entity7			1
they said he would continue to discuss the war effort in smaller groups in coming days , including during his trip to @entity150 , which starts thursday			0
@entity152 members of the @entity153 urged @entity3 in a letter sent wednesday -- veterans day -- to agree to the request for additional troops by @entity6 military leaders in @entity7			1
the letter , signed by 10 @entity152 committee members , said success in @entity7 will require local leaders and citizens being able to govern and secure their own country without " substantial " international assistance			2
" this wo n't be perfect or easy , but it will allow @entity6 's fighting men and women to leave @entity7 with honor , and it will enable @entity7 to build a better , more peaceful future , " the letter said			1
" that is our goal , and we must stay in the fight until is is won			0
" @entity152 leaders have criticized @entity3 for taking so long to decide on the troop request , but @entity51 said the process of analyzing the situation has been " very useful			2
" " there has been a refinement of objectives ; there has been discussion of various courses of action , " he said			0
" there have been explanations and discussions about how the civilian component of this will complement what is done by the work of our military troops			2
all in all , i think it has been a very productive couple of months that we have spent on this			0
" also wednesday , a new national poll showed @entity6 are split over whether @entity3 is taking too long to decide whether to send more @entity6 troops to the war in @entity7			1
the @entity201 survey also indicated that , by a narrow margin , @entity6 think the president should listen to the recommendations of the generals in charge of @entity6 troops in @entity7			1
according to the survey , 49 percent of people questioned say the president is taking too long to decide whether to increase @entity6 troop levels in @entity7 ; 50 percent do not			1
" there is a gender gap on this question , with most men saying @entity3 is taking too long and most women willing to give him more time , " @entity1 polling director @entity211 said			2
" that 's due in part to the partisan differences between men and women , but gender differences on the use of military force , and maybe even differences in how the genders make important decisions , can also be contributing to the split			0
" the poll indicates that 52 percent think @entity3 should listen to the generals , with 48 percent saying the president should take other matters into account as well			2
but a troop buildup remains unpopular , with a separate question indicating that a majority opposes sending more troops			2
roughly one in five @entity6 opposes more troops , yet also thinks that @entity3 should pay attention to the @entity6 military leaders in that country , @entity211 said			1
" that suggests that a lot of people who do n't support a troop build - up are unaware of gen. @entity248 's request for a bigger @entity6 military presence there , " he said			0
" and that , in turn , indicates that the military leaders in the field might provide @entity3 some political cover if he decides to increase troop strength there			0
" the poll also suggests widespread agreement among @entity6 that @entity7 will never have a stable democratic government , with only one in 10 people questioned saying that will occur within a year , and one - third saying it will ever happen			1
overall , 56 percent of @entity6 oppose sending more troops , while 42 percent favor increasing troop strength			1
the @entity201 poll was conducted october 30 - november 1 , with 1,018 adult @entity6 questioned by telephone			0
the survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample			0
