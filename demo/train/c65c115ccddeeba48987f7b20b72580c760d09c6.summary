@entity1 bloggers usually do n't have fan clubs			1
but 81 - year - old , twice - retired blogger @entity3 became an internet celebrity of sorts on thursday amid the confusion about the @entity1 's ruling on president @entity10 's health care law			1
moments after the ruling was handed down , both @entity13 and @entity14 briefly and incorrectly reported the @entity1 had struck down a central provision of @entity10 's health care law			1
@entity3 's online publication , @entity18 , which stands for @entity1 , however , got the news right , and published to @entity20 only a minute after @entity13 did			1
" # @entity1 upholds # @entity24 individual mandate , " said the blog 's @entity20 feed			1
more than 2,900 people retweeted that post			2
" i think it took us maybe three minutes to figure out exactly what the court had done , " which was to uphold a mandate on buying insurance , @entity3 said by phone on thursday afternoon			1
during that interview , fans approached @entity3 asking him to take pictures with them while wearing t - shirts that say things like " @entity39 " -- an internet meme started by fans of his fast - paced reporting			1
he does n't expect the attention to last			2
" in the digital and internet age , i know that celebrity is likely to be prolonged for less than the usual 15 minutes , " he said			1
" once today and maybe tomorrow is over , i think the phone at my house and my cell phone are going to stop ringing from people who want to talk to me			2
celebrity , if that 's what it is , is really fleeting ... " @entity3 and the @entity18 , which was founded by a husband - wife pair of attorneys in 2002 , have n't exactly become household names , at least until this week			1
their rise to prominence comes at a time when the @entity64 's instant news cycles are colliding with complicated stories like @entity1 rulings			1
plenty of news organizations leaned , in part , on @entity18 's fast , furious coverage of thursday 's ruling as a way to supplement their own live blogging of the event			2
twitter become so flooded with chatter about the @entity18 that @entity78 's @entity77 wrote , " @entity20 is basically a mirror of @entity18 now			1
" @entity81 spokesman @entity80 reportedly said in a news conference wednesday that he would rely on tv news and the @entity18 to see what the court had decided in the landmark health care case			0
editors at the blog anticipated the attention			0
$ 25k for 20 mins , " the group wrote on its @entity20 feed , @ @entity18 , which had more than 42,000 followers as of about 1 p.m. et on thursday			1
" probably more traffic today than in @entity98 's first 5 years , combined			0
so grateful ; a little scared , " the group said on @entity20 before the decision was handed down			1
the site has become known for its " plain @entity104 " versions of court news and for its expertise			0
@entity3 , the veteran blogger , is n't an attorney but he joked in a 2007 interview with @entity108 that he has " always indulged the arrogance of saying the only time i 've ever been in a law school was to teach			1
" the blog 's co-founders , @entity114 and @entity115 , are both lawyers			0
@entity114 teaches @entity1 litigation at @entity117 and @entity118 and has argued 25 cases in front of the @entity1 , according to his online bio			1
@entity122 has argued two cases in front of the court			0
@entity3 started his day by posting to the network 's live blog : " good morning from a slightly zoo - like , but still surprisingly civil , press room at the @entity1			1
" three minutes later , a reader asked if he thought there would be a " clear majority " opinion			0
" i am still hugging the trunk of the tree -- solidly avoiding any predicton ( sic ) , " he wrote			0
" no limbs for a traditional journalist			0
" @entity3 , who has covered the @entity1 for 52 years and has twice gone into retirement , does n't relish the attention			1
in fact , it bothers him a bit			0
" i 'm afraid i will be accused of false modesty if i say what i really feel , which is that in all of my years of journalism , i had never wanted to be part of the story			0
i would hope that when i say that people will take me sincerely			0
i grew up in journalism believing that the story was the story -- and not the messenger , " he said			0
" and what this kind of celebrity , as you put it , does is to lift the reporter out from behind the screen of objectivity and make the reporter the story			2
and that 's troubling to me			0
" that kind of comment probably only will make fans adore him more			2
" we are grateful to you ! thank you for everything			0
# @entity39 , " one wrote on @entity20			1
" because it is important to say , right now : # @entity170 ! " said another			2
for a blogger , @entity3 has an unusual history with technology			1
" i do n't do the @entity20 thing very much , " he said			1
" i used to do it a bit			0
i 'm usually so verbose in my writing -- 140 characters is n't nearly enough for me to even clear my throat			2
" in 1998 or 1999 , he paid a tutor to teach him how to use the @entity64			1
he often calls in information -- even entire stories -- to the blog 's editors by phone , as he did with thursday 's news			2
asked what keeps him going at age 81 , he gave a personal answer			2
" my father retired and it was virtually the end of his life , " he said			0
" he really declined after that			0
a long time ago i made up my mind that i would find something active to do , even though i left newspapering and sort of thought i was retired			0
... it is just so immensely fascinating to me and i do find that having a prolonged institutional memory about the court and about the law and particularly about the @entity202 makes it even fun for me to do			0
and it allows me to be an even greater resource for my readers			0
" just in case you 're thinking the @entity64 has gotten way too serious -- court reporter as meme ? -- do n't fret			2
there 's of course another website that chose to tell the story of the court 's decision in cat photos .			0
