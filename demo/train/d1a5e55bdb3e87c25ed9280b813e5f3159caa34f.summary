@entity0 -- @entity6 's controversial new immigration law could harm local law enforcement efforts , a delegation of police chiefs from across the country told attorney general @entity8 in a closed - door meeting wednesday			1
the officials , representing several major cities and a handful of @entity6 communities , told @entity8 the requirement to check the immigration status of many individuals stopped by officers would divert police resources away from crime - fighting efforts and build mistrust between police and the @entity23 community			1
they warned that members of immigrant communities could become more reluctant to step forward and talk to police			0
" in fact , the majority of us believe [ the @entity6 law ] will actually cause crime to increase , " said @entity27 , the police chief of @entity28 , @entity29			1
a spokesman for @entity8 said after the meeting that the attorney general had heard the chiefs ' message			2
" the attorney general thought the police chiefs raised important concerns about the impact the @entity6 law will have on the ability of law enforcement to keep communities safe , " spokesman @entity40 said			1
the chiefs told reporters that @entity8 gave them no indication of when -- or if -- the federal government would file a legal challenge to the law			2
@entity8 said " there would be a decision coming soon on some of the federal issues associated with this , " said @entity53 , police chief for @entity54 , @entity6			2
@entity53 , who heads the @entity59 , said law enforcement officials have consistently supported the use of more federal resources -- including @entity64 troops -- to clamp down on illegal immigration			1
president @entity67 plans to deploy up to 1,200 more @entity64 troops to the @entity70 border with @entity71 , an administration official said tuesday			0
in addition , the president will request $ 500 million to supplement current spending for enhanced border protection and law enforcement activities , the official said			0
" any resources at this point are going to be useful , " noted @entity77 , @entity6 , police chief @entity78			0
" but i do n't want to just treat the symptoms of the problem			0
" @entity78 said the federal government must act to resolve the illegal immigration problem or face a " patchwork quilt " of state laws trying to deal with the issue			0
@entity6 's law allows officers to check the residency status of anyone who is being investigated for a crime or possible legal infraction -- if there is reasonable suspicion the person is an illegal resident			1
critics -- including @entity8 -- have argued the law will promote racial profiling			0
representatives of law enforcement groups supporting the law were not included in the delegation that met with @entity8			1
several @entity6 sheriffs and other individual police officers have backed the measure as a necessary step in the face of what has been widely construed as a federal failure to protect the @entity71 border			0
" @entity6 sheriffs are elected officials and that changes your perspective , " noted @entity111 , @entity112 , police commissioner @entity113			0
@entity113 , who opposes @entity6 's law , said if the measure is upheld by the courts it would be enforced by law enforcement officials , despite any misgivings they might have			1
@entity113 and other chiefs said they understand the public 's frustration and they recognize the popularity of @entity6 's action in several state legislatures .			2
