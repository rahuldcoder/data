@entity0 -- in the context of 2016 , @entity2 and @entity3 are rivals for the @entity7 ' presidential nomination whose every word about each other is scrutinized and picked apart			1
but @entity10 and @entity11 have been on the national stage for years , and before they were ever considered rivals , they met each other in the late ' 90s			2
@entity10 spoke about the meeting in a 2004 interview on @entity21 ' " now on @entity20 " show			1
@entity10 reflects glowingly of @entity11 as first lady but also bluntly talks about how @entity11 's election to the @entity24 in 2000 changed the former secretary of state			1
in 1998 , @entity10 -- an expert and professor on bankruptcy law -- wrote an op - ed for the @entity29 titled " bankrupt ? pay your child support first , " about how the @entity32 would disproportionally hurt women and families trying to collect alimony checks from their ex-husbands			2
the piece , @entity10 tells @entity21 , was eventually read by then - first lady @entity11 , whose office subsequently set up a meeting with the professor in @entity42			1
" after she 's finished her speech , we 're ushered into a tiny , little room somewhere in the bowels of this hotel , and just the two of us			0
we have hamburgers and french fries , " @entity10 says			0
@entity10 adds : " and she ( @entity11 ) says , ' tell me about bankruptcy			1
' and i got to tell you , i never had a smarter student			2
@entity56 , right to the heart of it			0
i go over the law			0
it 's a complex law			0
showed her the graphs , showed her the charts			0
" according to @entity10 , at the end of the briefing , @entity11 stood up and said : " professor @entity10 , we 've got to stop that awful bill			1
" @entity10 opinion : what happened to the middle class ? the first lady went back to @entity0 and became a strong proponent of killing the bill			2
in " @entity78 , " her memoir about her time as first lady , @entity11 writes : " proposed bankruptcy reform moving through @entity80 threatened to undermine the spousal and child support many women depended on			0
" she writes , " missing from this debate , i discovered , was any discussion of what happens to women and children who depend on legally required child and spousal support that is not being paid			0
" president @entity11 would go on to veto the measure , a win that @entity10 says @entity2 " rightly should " take credit for			1
but then @entity10 's interview with @entity21 takes a turn as the professor reflects on how @entity11 changed when she won a @entity24 seat in 2000 and voted in favor of a similar bankruptcy bill in 2001			1
" as senator @entity11 , the pressures are very different , " @entity10 says			1
" it 's a well - financed industry			0
... she has taken money from the groups , and more to the point , she worries about them as a constituency			0
" @entity3 in 2016 ? @entity108 take notice @entity11 is not the only one who was changed by the @entity24 , however			1
@entity10 , who since 2004 has gone on to become a senator from @entity112 , was far more candid about @entity11 in her 2004 interview than she was in an interview with @entity117 's @entity116 this week			1
" you know , i worry a lot about the relationship between all of them : regulators , government and @entity122 , " @entity10 said when asked if @entity11 was " too cozy " with @entity122			2
@entity116 then pressed @entity10 : " but what about @entity2 in particular ? " " well , " she responds			2
" i worry across the board			0
" @entity10 co-authored opinion : we need to rein in ' too big to fail ' banks			0

@entity3 told @entity21 in 2004 that she briefed @entity2 about bankruptcy
@entity11 helped veto a bankruptcy bill . " i never had a smarter student , " @entity10 said
@entity10 said as senator , @entity11 changed position because of the financial *services* industry
the 2004 exchange shows how @entity10 's changed , too -- she 's now less candid about @entity11
