-- as a player who has won @entity4 and @entity5 titles with @entity6 and @entity8 league and @entity10 titles with @entity11 as well as three african footballer of the year awards , @entity1 expects to command respect			1
@entity11 star @entity1 is one of a number of top footballers who have spoken out against racism			1
yet @entity18 's spectacular career in @entity8 , where his goalscoring prowess have made him one of the world 's most feared and admired strikers , has been punctuated by incidents in which he has been the victim of sickening racist abuse			1
memorably , @entity1 started to walk off the pitch in protest during a match at @entity27 in 2006 after being taunted by home supporters chanting monkey noises only to be persuaded to return by his @entity11 teammates and the club 's coach , @entity32			1
" i was leaving the field and if it was n't for @entity32 , my teammates and the referee , i would have done it , " @entity1 recalls			1
" in that moment you start thinking whether there is something wrong with being black , you know ? but i think we are all humans , everyone 's blood is the same color and we all have the same heart			2
i do n't see any differences in skin color			2
" while @entity8 football 's reputation for sophistication and flair has made @entity57 one of the most attractive and marketable competitions in world football , attitudes in the stands have not always kept apace with the cosmopolitanism on display on the pitch			2
nor has positive leadership always come from the top			0
@entity27 were fined just 9,000 euros ( $ 13,800 ) for the abuse directed by their supporters at @entity1			1
and in 2005 , the @entity8 national coach @entity68 -- currently steering @entity8 through @entity69 -- was at the center of controversy when he used a racist slur to describe @entity74 striker @entity73 , now a teammate of @entity1 's at @entity11			1
@entity1 admits that racism is so widespread in @entity8 that he no longer dares take his family to matches			1
" @entity79 can happen anywhere and i do n't want them to see it , " he told @entity0			0
" it 's a sad situation in football			0
in my opinion the problem is getting bigger and the people that should come up with a solution are not doing it			0
so to protect my family , i do n't take them to the game			1
" with black players regularly subjected to monkey chants in @entity8 stadiums , @entity1 believes determined action is needed before verbal abuse spills over into physical violence			1
" the authorities are working to find solutions			0
but they must find them			0
we ca n't wait until some crazy fan jumps from his seat and kills a black player before measures are taken			1
the players are revolted by it and we try to help each other			0
but the authorities must find a way to set an example			0
" one of the saddest aspects of racism in football is that many of those who participate in taunting colored players would never dream of behaving the same way on the street , at work or at home			2
but @entity1 fears attitudes in stadiums may reflect wider social attitudes which find expression amid the passion , emotion and anonymity of the football crowd " @entity134 stadiums are just a reflection of what is going on in society , " @entity1 says			2
" many times in stadiums people just feel more relaxed and say what they think when they 're somewhere else			0
" he believes the @entity8 media has a key part to play in tackling racism in football , not just by highlighting incidents of abuse but in creating an environment in which racism in the stands is no longer quietly condoned			1
" i do n't make the decisions , but something needs to be done			0
right now , the media here pays attention to the incidents of racism , but does n't discuss solutions			2
they use these images to create an impact rather than to identify racism as a problem and to urge people to find a solution			0
@entity164 has a lot of weight on public opinion and what the industry must do is make people feel a social responsibility to stop this kind of behavior			0
