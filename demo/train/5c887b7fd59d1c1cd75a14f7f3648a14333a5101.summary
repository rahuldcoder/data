@entity0 -- one of the world 's most famous poets and writers , an inspiration to countless women , recently celebrated her birthday			1
at her home in @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity9 celebrated turning 82			1
born in an era unfriendly to women whose ambitions would take them out of the home or away from a narrow range of " acceptable " jobs , she nonetheless succeeded in many fields			1
she has led an admirably peripatetic life ; she has been an author , dancer , actor , civil rights activist , radio host			2
hailed , above all , for her vivid written portrayals of adolescent life in the @entity28 and the horrors of her violent childhood , she 's become a role model of resilience for generations of @entity35 women			1
when she speaks , it is with intense clarity , as if her words are aligned , standing at attention			0
untethered from convention and politesse by age , hard - won experience and inner strength , she expresses truths that many women may suspect but are loath to admit			2
" i love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels , " she once said			1
" life 's a bitch			2
you 've got to go out and kick a- -			0
" but 41 years after the she grabbed those lapels with her groundbreaking novel " @entity58 , " i found myself reflecting at her party on what has -- and has not -- changed for women heading out into the world			1
the truth is , it 's still very hard to get to the point of accomplishment of a @entity9			1
modern women still struggle to succeed without being labeled the witch , ditz or office pariah			1
indeed , young women i meet when i speak with college students across the country are aware of this as they prepare to plunge into their adult lives			2
i find that regardless of the career opportunities that are at their fingertips , advances that their foremothers would scarcely have believed , some women ( especially women of color ) still brace themselves for limitations and obstacles			2
is there a magic key to a life lived free of gender and racial biases , they ask ? there is not			2
but how long must young women leaving high schools and universities expect to be swimming against generations - long waves ? we have come a long way , but still we see reflected in the media daily the crude stereotypes that confront and trivialize accomplished and prominent women			0
it might be a first lady mocked for revealing a little cleavage , another first lady questioned for leaving her job to take care of her children or a candidate for vice president criticized for her commitment to family			0
and though women represent more than half the voting age population and are a significant political force , at this " post-feminist " moment , only six of the nation 's 50 governors and only 17 of the 100 @entity35 senators are women			0
at the same time , the @entity123 's 2009 @entity122 showed that more women than men over the age of 25 have bachelor 's , graduate and professional degrees			0
and a recent @entity130 , entitled " @entity131 , " cited statistics from a @entity134 survey that shows that women 's median income rose 32.9 percent from 1990 to 2006 , while men 's only rose 6.3 percent			0
should we be surprised how young women respond to these mixed messages ? i talked with @entity9 about such issues when she welcomed me as a guest on her program and later invited me to her home to discuss themes about womanhood that i would eventually explore in a book			1
we talked about how the limitations placed on us as young girls began with our families			0
i still bristle , and told her so , about how my family had advised me to learn to type and become a secretary			0
she counseled that they had done that out of love , that their intention was not " to break you			0
" rather , the intent was " to keep you from breaking your heart			0
" but as we all know , the world can be much crueler than our families : the route to success for women , politically , economically and personally , is often lined with broken hearts and humbling moments that i would hope do more to ignite our determination than quell it			0
maybe we can argue that our defeats kindle resilience ? i wonder if @entity9 's living legacy reaches today into the lives of modern women whose intelligence , determination -- and resilience -- helped them surmount obstacles on the way to lofty positions in the world			1
yes , there are mixed messages everywhere for young women , but then there are the achievements of a @entity185 , a @entity186 , a @entity187			0
@entity188 , determined women willing to push aside the obstacles that a sometimes retrograde culture throws in their way can take inspiration from those women 's successes			1
and as @entity9 once said , " history , despite its wrenching pain , can not be unlived , but if faced with courage , need not be lived again			1
" the birthday girl speaks the truth			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			1

@entity203 says @entity9 , whose life has inspired many women , has turned 82
she says @entity9 tells women to " grab life by the lapels , " but culture presents *hurdles*
women succeed in earning , *education* ; *lag* in @entity218 , pop culture portrayals , she says
@entity203 : @entity9 can inspire women to be determined , resilient and to surmount barriers
