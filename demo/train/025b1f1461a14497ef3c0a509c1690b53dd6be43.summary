hours after president @entity0 said the fatal shooting of an unarmed @entity3 - @entity3 teen in @entity4 requires national " soul searching , " a lawyer for the man at the center of an investigation said the shooting had nothing to do with race			1
" i asked him , ' are you a racist ? do you have anything against black people ? ' and he said ' no ' , " @entity18 's legal adviser @entity17 told @entity19			1
@entity17 said @entity18 and his wife served as mentors to two teenage children of an @entity3 - @entity3 woman			1
though funding was cut for the program , the couple continued their efforts on their own , taking the 13 - year - old girl and 14 - year - old boy on outings to a mall , a science center and a basketball game			2
they also helped in a fundraiser for an @entity3 church , the lawyer said			2
" i do not believe that 's the indication of a person who 's a racist , " @entity17 said			2
" i do n't see anything that indicates to me that he 's a racist			2
" @entity47 , 17 , died february 26			0
police say he was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in @entity50 , @entity4 , who said he was acting in self - defense			2
@entity47 was unarmed , carrying a bag of @entity55 candy and an iced tea , according to police			0
although a grand jury is scheduled to convene april 10 to look into the case , authorities have declined to arrest @entity18 , sparking a national debate over @entity4 's " stand your ground " deadly force law amid concerns about racial profiling			1
the family of @entity18 , a white @entity68 , said he has been wrongly described as a racist			1
@entity0 spoke out publicly friday for the first time on the matter			1
" when i think about this boy , i think about my own kids , " @entity0 told reporters in response to a question			1
" and i think every parent in @entity78 should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this and that everybody pulls together -- federal , state and local -- to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened			0
" @entity0 praised @entity4 gov. @entity88 's decision to create a task force to review the " stand your ground " law and said that it would be important to " examine the laws and the context for what happened as well as the specifics of the incident			1
" " but my main message is to the parents of @entity47 , " @entity0 said			1
" i think they are right to expect that all of us as @entity78 are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves and we will get to the bottom of exactly what happened , " he said			0
and he obliquely addressed the racial component of the case , saying it struck home for him because , " if i had a son , he 'd look like @entity47			2
" the teenager 's parents , @entity116 and @entity117 , said in a statement that it was " humbling " that @entity0 had talked about their son			1
" the president 's personal comments touch us deeply and made us wonder : if his son looked like @entity47 and wore a hoodie , would he be suspicious , too ? " @entity47 was wearing a hooded sweatshirt the day he was killed			2
the case unfolded when @entity18 , who was patrolling his gated community , saw @entity47 walking in the neighborhood			1
@entity18 called 911 and reported what he described as a suspicious person			1
moments later , several neighbors called the emergency number to report a commotion outside			0
police arrived to find @entity47 dead of a gunshot wound			0
authorities say they have not charged @entity18 because they have no evidence to contradict his story that he shot in self - defense			1
@entity17 told @entity19 that @entity18 was injured on the night of the killing			1
" i believe that his nose was broken ; he sustained injury to his nose and on the back of his head he sustained a cut that was serious enough it probably should have had stitches , " @entity17 said			0
but by the time @entity18 reached a doctor , " there was an option not to stitch it up because it had already started healing , is my understanding , " said the lawyer , who has talked with his client only by telephone			1
@entity17 said the injures " were from @entity47 , i assume			0
" the lawyer said he and @entity18 had not discussed what happened the night @entity47 was shot , though he said that @entity18 has talked with authorities -- unaccompanied by counsel -- whenever they have asked him to do so			1
@entity17 said he has advised his client to keep a low profile			0
" i believe his life is in danger , " said @entity17			1
" this case is spinning out of control , " he said			2
" i hope there 's a way to rein things in so it does n't become an issue of a racial battle			2
i hope that things come back so that there can be a time for justice and for healing and not for just skipping the whole judicial process and going straight to sentencing			0
" police have taken the gun used in the shooting and are holding it as evidence , he said			2
" whatever transpired that night , it 's unfortunate that there 's a young man in the prime of his life that was left dead , " @entity17 added			1
opinion : what every black mother fears neighbors call watch leader caring , polite case sparks dialogue on racial inequality heated debate has erupted over whether @entity18 used a racial slur during the 911 call , which was released this week			1
did shooter use a racial slur ? a top @entity19 audio engineer enhanced the sound of the 911 call , and several members of @entity19 's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus			2
the case has prompted a @entity212 investigation , which is in the fact - finding stage			1
whether @entity18 used such language before shooting @entity47 is key , according to @entity19 senior legal analyst @entity215			1
" it 's extremely , extremely significant , because the federal government is not allowed to prosecute just your ordinary , everyday murder , " he said			2
" two people fighting on the street is not a federal crime			0
however , if one person shoots another based on racial hostility , racial animus , that does become a federal crime			0
" photos : million hoodie march a special prosecutor appointed by gov. @entity88 , @entity231 , said friday that her office can charge @entity18 , clear him or send the case to the grand jury			1
rallies and protests also continued friday			0
congressional staffers rallied in an event dubbed " @entity239 " organized by several staff organizations , while students walked out of classes at six @entity244 - area high schools to protest police handling of the case and demand changes in @entity4 's law			1
at @entity251 in @entity252 , students lined up on the football field to form the initials , " @entity255 " @entity256 issued a statement saying @entity47 's mother asked students to focus instead on signing petitions , attending rallies and praying			2
" our most important mission is to provide a safe learning environment for students , and so we are asking them to respect the wishes of @entity47 's mother by celebrating his memory not through walkouts , but through reflection and civic participation , " superintendent @entity262 said			0
students walk out in protest over shooting death demonstrations were planned over the weekend in @entity278 and @entity279 and monday in @entity50 and @entity280			0
shooting renews debate over ' stand your ground ' laws amid the protests and calls for reform , some @entity4 lawmakers said it was time to revisit the 2005 " stand your ground " law , which eliminated a long - standing provision requiring people facing danger outside of their homes to first attempt to retreat before meeting a threat with force			1
@entity215 : does @entity4 law let killers go free ? since the law 's adoption , the number of justifiable homicide rulings in @entity4 has nearly tripled , according to the state department of @entity307			0
" we foretold that this would happen while we debated this law and a lot of us voted against it , " @entity4 state rep. @entity308 told @entity19 on friday			0
" they turned a blind eye to it			0
but now that @entity78 's looking at @entity4 , now people are starting to react and starting to really recognize what we were saying back in 2005 in the @entity317			0
" but a co-sponsor of the law , sen. @entity320 , @entity319 , said the law was not at fault			0
he credited the statute for a " serious decrease " in violent crime			0
@entity320 said it is up to the grand jury to decide whether any laws were broken , but left no doubt where he stands			1
" quite frankly , anyone who steps out in a pursuit in a confrontational mode with a firearm ? that 's not a self - protection act			1
" he said one good outcome of the killing may be clarification over how the law ought to be applied			0
" maybe we do need some direction , " he said			0
" maybe we need to give direction to @entity348			0
" police chief steps aside ' temporarily ' the incident has damaged relations between the @entity353 and the city 's @entity3 residents , city manager @entity350 said friday			0
" we have to start from ground zero , " he said			0
the depths to which community relations had sunk was underscored by the arrest friday of a 68 - year - old @entity361 white man for allegedly threatening to harm @entity362 , who stepped down " temporarily " on thursday as @entity50 's police chief			1
" you and your family deserve to be hunted down and shot like a dog , just like @entity47 , " says the e-mail that led to the arrest			0
" your entire police department is nothing more than a collection of incompetent , bigoted , unprofessional a * * holes			0

" i believe his life is in danger , " @entity18 's lawyer says
