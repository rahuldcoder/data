now , imagine winds that are 2,000 times faster , stripping a galaxy of its future light and heat			2
@entity11 does n't begin to describe it			0
data from the new @entity14 , a growing array of radio telescopes in the high desert of @entity18 , have mapped a " superwind " flowing out of a nearby galaxy			1
this galaxy , named @entity22 ( because it is the 253rd object in the @entity24 of galaxies ) , is a bit like our own @entity28 galaxy in that it has a large disk of cold gas ( atoms and molecules of matter ) out of which stars are constantly forming			1
but @entity22 is a galaxy on steroids : it is forming stars at about 100 times the rate of the @entity28			1
that 's why it 's called a " starburst " galaxy			1
this made it a great target to observe with @entity14 , which can see light from the gas from which those stars form			1
this light is not visible with the human eye			0
it 's electromagnetic radiation like visible light but with a much longer wavelength			2
to observe it , we use radio telescopes , which look a lot like your basic satellite dish , only much bigger and more numerous			2
( eventually , @entity14 will consist of 66 dishes , each 40 feet in diameter			0
) astronomers used @entity14 to measure the amount of carbon monoxide molecules in @entity22 's superwind and to extrapolate the total amount of cold gas being blasted out of the galaxy			1
what 's the big deal ? well , for the first time , the new @entity14 analysis shows enough mass in this wind to carry away a large fraction of the gas in the galaxy			1
this suggests an answer to a longstanding mystery about why galaxies today do not have more stars			1
let 's delve more into this mystery by looking at galaxies grow			1
over the 13.7 billion years since the @entity90 origin of the universe , familiar building blocks of matter -- electrons , protons and neutrons -- cooled and combined to form atoms			0
then , as this gas cooled further , some of the atoms combined to form molecules			2
meanwhile , gravity amplified regions of high density so stars and whole galaxies formed out of the cold , dense gas			1
but straightforward calculations describing this process tell us that today 's galaxies should be filled with more stars , shining more brightly , than we see			1
something must disrupt the ordinary , gravity - powered process of coalescence and star formation			0
what 's missing ? cold gas			1
the new @entity14 data show clearly that the gas from which those stars would form is being blown out of the galaxy			1
it 's a funny kind of death by excess : the very high number of stars forming in @entity22 generates a lot of heat , blowing winds off their surfaces , and these streams of heated stellar material unite to push away the surrounding gas that has not formed stars			1
when a superwind disrupts the gas clouds that might have formed more stars , we call it " feedback , " because if the star formation rate is very high , the superwind is strong , so a lot of gas is heated and / or ejected from the galaxy , so fewer stars form , and the superwind dies down			1
conspicuous over-producers like @entity22 are doomed , it seems , to cut off their own star production			0
think of it as appetite control			0
gravity just keeps pulling on mass ( particles , atoms , molecules , dark matter )			2
if gravity were the only important effect , the clouds of gas would keep condensing and forming many more stars than we see			1
but the superwind keeps this from happening			2
@entity164 of the @entity165 , who led the @entity14 study of @entity22 , explained , " for the first time , we can clearly see massive concentrations of cold molecular gas being jettisoned by expanding shells of intense pressure created by young stars			1
the amount of gas we measure gives us very convincing evidence that some growing galaxies blow out more gas than they take in , slowing star formation down to a crawl			1
" a talented science team was behind this result			0
but it would n't have been possible without the new @entity14 telescope array , which was built by the @entity185 in partnership with @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and the host country , @entity18			0
@entity14 is the largest ground - based astronomical project ever , taking more than 20 years from conception to operation and costing about $ 1.3 billion , with roughly one - third funded by the @entity185			0
it is a model of international cooperation : each partner supplied a share of the antennas , and an international organization oversees telescope operations			0
@entity14 is sited in @entity18 because the @entity203 is ideal for millimeter astronomy			0
its extreme dryness and high altitude -- about 16,500 feet above sea level -- mean greater atmospheric transparency to the high - frequency radio waves @entity14 was designed to detect			0
( the wavelength of this light is about 1 millimeter , hence the " m " in the name			0
) people often debate the value of astronomy			0
it wo n't cure cancer or eradicate poverty			0
but it has its practical value , well beyond the primary goal of understanding how the present - day universe -- and our @entity223 , @entity225 and @entity28 galaxy -- came to be			2
those digital images you take with your camera or phone are possible because of tools that were developed for astronomy about 30 years ago			0
think we need a work force better trained in science and technology ? astronomy gets kids -- and the curious inner kid in all of us -- interested in science			0
in @entity18 , astronomy is an important part of the high - tech economy			0
could we live without knowing about the superwind in @entity22 ? sure			2
but , like art , astronomy is part of what enriches our lives			0
for some of us , learning where we came from is what it 's all about			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .			1

@entity257 : new data have mapped a " superwind " flowing out of a nearby galaxy
@entity257 : there is enough mass in the wind to carry away a lot of gas in the galaxy
she says this suggests an answer to why galaxies today do not have more stars
@entity257 : it 's because cold gas , which forms stars , is being blown out of galaxies
