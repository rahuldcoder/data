@entity0 , @entity1 -- an unemployed security guard from @entity4 is @entity1 's top snoozer			1
@entity7 , 62 , was able to nap for 17 minutes and register a 70 - decibel snore while sprawled out on a couch in the middle of a crowded shopping mall in what 's been billed as the first - ever @entity13 , @entity2 sister network @entity6 reported			1
the grand siesta champ won the first cash prize of 1,000 euros ( about $ 1,400 ) in credit to purchase goods at the shopping center in @entity0			2
the competitors started off by lying down on blue sofas , some in pajamas			0
each got to eat a lunch ahead of time , then had twenty minutes to get as much z 's as they could squeeze in			0
hundreds of contestants took part in the siesta championship which began october 14 and ended saturday			1
the intricate rules award points to contestants depending on how long they sleep during the 20 - minute competition time , any unusual positions they sleep in , eye - catching pajamas they might be wearing , and yes , a lot of extra points for snoring			0
the sponsors say it 's meant to raise eyes to the problem of a country that 's become so fast - paced that many say the traditional siesta is at risk			2
" the modern life is a danger that we feel is against the siesta			1
when you sleep la siesta everyone has the image that your life is calm , you have a good life			0
and then , the modern life is a direct attack , " said @entity57 , president of the @entity58 of @entity59 earlier in the competition			2
his group , which includes about 50 of his friends across @entity1 , persuaded a shopping center , @entity65 , to host and pay prize money for the siesta competition			0
in the competition , the siesta is limited to 20 minutes , a duration which the organizers and some doctors say is optimal ; a quick nap after lunch to get refreshed , without entering a deep sleep cycle			0
but the traditional siesta in @entity1 often lasts an hour or more			1
the bustling shopping center where the siesta championship is being held is a prime example of the changing times in @entity1			1
the stores do n't close at lunchtime -- which is what used to happen with @entity1 shops -- so instead of sleeping the siesta , people are working or shopping			0
siesta lovers complain that @entity1 's frenetic push to compete in the global economy means longer , more pressure - package workdays , even if some @entity1 workers still get a two - hour lunch break			1
