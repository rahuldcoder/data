-- a @entity2 television show is offering contestants what it claims is the " biggest prize ever " -- the chance for atheists to convert to one of the world 's major religions			1
the tv show offers converts to @entity13 the chance to visit @entity15			1
the show , called " @entity17 , " or " @entity18 , " features a @entity20 imam , a catholic priest , a @entity23 rabbi and a @entity25 monk attempting to persuade 10 atheists of the merits of their religion , according to @entity29			1
if they succeed , the contestants are rewarded with a pilgrimage to one of their chosen faith 's most sacred sites -- @entity15 for @entity20 , @entity35 for converts to @entity37 , a trip to @entity39 for @entity40 and the chance to visit @entity42 and the @entity43 for @entity44			0
@entity45 , deputy director of @entity2 channel @entity46 , which will air the show from september , said the program aimed to " turn disbelievers on to @entity50			1
" " people are free to believe anything they want			0
our program does not have a say , " he said , according to @entity2 newspaper @entity57			2
contestants will be judged by a panel of eight theologians and religious experts prior to going on the show to make sure their lack of faith is genuine			1
but the show has been condemned by @entity2 religious leaders			1
the head of the country 's supreme council of religious affairs , @entity67 , told @entity29 that it was " disrespectful " to place different faiths in competition with each other and accused @entity46 of using religion to boost ratings			2
" to do such a thing for the sake of ratings , not only with @entity13 but with all religions is disrespectful , " said @entity67			0
" @entity81 should not be the subject of this type of program			0
" although @entity2 has a predominantly @entity20 population and culture , religion is a sensitive subject because of the country 's staunchly secular constitution which outlaws most displays of faith in public life			2
last year the @entity95 - influenced government of @entity2 prime minister @entity96 clashed with the country 's constitutional court when judges overturned the efforts of @entity96 's @entity101 to lift a ban on female students wearing headscarves at public universities			0
