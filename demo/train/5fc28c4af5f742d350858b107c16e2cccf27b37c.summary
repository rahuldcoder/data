@entity0 -- the rules governing air traffic over @entity6 's @entity5 need to be rewritten to prevent another mishap like this month 's fatal collision of a small plane and a sightseeing helicopter , federal safety investigators said thursday			1
the wreckage of a plane that collided with a helicopter is lifted this month from the @entity5			1
the recommendation comes three weeks after nine people were killed when the two aircraft collided in the congested airspace bordering @entity18			1
the recommendation is noteworthy both because of its sweeping nature and its timing			0
ordinarily , the @entity21 makes recommendations at the conclusion of its investigation , which typically take a year			1
but in a letter to @entity28 administrator @entity27 , @entity21 chairman @entity29 said that based on preliminary findings , the safety board is concerned about the " safety of flight " over the @entity5			1
she outlined a series of changes , among them requiring that helicopters and fixed - wing aircraft fly at different altitudes over the river			1
she made specific reference to " the performance of air traffic controllers " at @entity45 in @entity46 , who were monitoring the plane 's flight during the august 8 collision			1
" the @entity21 is concerned with the complacency and inattention to duty evidenced by the actions of the [ @entity45 ] controller and the supervisor during the events surrounding this accident , " @entity29 wrote			2
@entity29 said the pilot of the aircraft requested permission to climb to 3,500 feet minutes before the crash			2
but because there was no coordination between controllers at @entity45 and @entity68 airports , controllers did not grant the request , increasing the risk of a collision in @entity5 low - altitude airspace known as the " exclusionary zone , " she said			1
pilots in the exclusionary zone are not separated by air traffic controllers , and instead use visual " see and avoid " tactics			0
the @entity45 controller was making a personal phone call and " was not fully engaged in his duties " in the minutes leading up to the accident , @entity29 said			0
his supervisor , meanwhile , had left the building on a personal errand without informing the controller			0
the air traffic controller 's inappropriate phone call " likely would not have been permitted " if the supervisor had been in the tower , @entity29 said			0
the @entity28 on thursday did not comment on the @entity21 recommendation , but said a task force studying flight operations above the @entity5 will soon submit its findings			1
and the air traffic controllers union defended its member , saying he had handed off the plane 's pilot to another radar tower before the helicopter appeared on his radar scope			2
" the @entity21 again has rushed to wrongly blame the air traffic controller in this incident , " said @entity103 , president of the @entity104			2
" the bottom line here is that the controller is not responsible for contributing to this tragic accident			0
... we can not provide traffic advisories to aircraft we are not talking to , can not see on radar or are not a factor at all			0
" @entity103 said the @entity21 " inexplicably " made its recommendations before the @entity28 task force had finished its job			0
" the task force is due to release its report next week			0
so why the rush ? " @entity103 said			0
in its letter , the @entity21 asks the @entity28 to establish a special flight rules area , or @entity127 , for the class b exclusion areas near @entity6 ; require vertical separation between helicopters and airplanes in these @entity131 ; require pilots to complete specific training on the @entity127 requirements before flight within the area ; and conduct a review of other airspace configurations where specific pilot training and familiarization would improve safety .			2

@entity21 advises rule changes over @entity5 after august 8 crash
nine people were killed when helicopter , small plane collided
one *proposal* : make helicopters , fixed - wing aircraft fly at different altitudes over river
@entity21 makes recommendation before end of crash probe -- a rare move
