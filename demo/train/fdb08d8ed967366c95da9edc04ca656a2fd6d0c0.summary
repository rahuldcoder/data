-- @entity2 drivers will get two points for the price of one at the final race of 2014 under new rules announced monday			1
the victorious driver in the season - ending @entity9 will now win 50 points compared to 25 points for each of the other 18 races			1
but former @entity2 race winner @entity14 fears the idea of dishing out double points at the @entity9 is nothing more than a gimmick designed to manufacture a false climax to the season			1
" this is a mechanism to try and alleviate the championship being won before the final round , " @entity14 , who ended his @entity2 career with the @entity23 team , told @entity0			1
" if someone is second and close to the race leader and there is a chance to overtake and eventually win the championship , that 's what they 're trying to achieve			0
" the one thing that @entity2 does not need is the championship being won two or more races out			2
" that just does n't do @entity2 , its audience and the people who are investing in that audience any good whatsoever			2
" in 2012 , when there were seven drivers winning the first races , the public enjoyed that and that 's what they want to see			0
" as much as they admire @entity50 and @entity51 , it was entertaining motor racing and the early 2012 model ( of competition ) is what @entity2 should be trying to achieve			1
" but all double points would have done in 2013 is to guarantee more points for @entity50 because they had already won the championship			1
" the doubles point is a novelty more than anything else			0
the teams that are the most successful that season will benefit from it most			2
" i might be proved wrong but it seems to me that this is n't a meaningful change			0
" i think that 's it 's something done in haste in response to what we 've seen this year			0
" @entity50 and @entity51 powered to the last four @entity2 world championships and in 2011 and 2013 , the @entity78 driver wrapped up the titles with races to spare			1
in contrast , @entity51 edged the 2010 and 2012 titles at the final race of the season and if the double points had been on offer in 2012 @entity86 's @entity85 would have nicked the crown			1
but even the man who survived those nail - biting contests appears to be skeptical about plans to change the points system			0
@entity78 magazine @entity94 confirmed to @entity0 that the four - time world champion had described the rule change in a telephone conversation to them as " absurd " and it would " punish those who have worked hard for a whole season			1
" the @entity101 explained the rule changes in a statement which read : " double drivers ' and constructors ' points will be awarded at the final race of the @entity2 season in order to maximize focus on the championship until the end of the campaign			1
" double your money ? end - of - season performance determines how @entity2 's prize money is roughly divvied up between the teams			2
each marque gets a share of the prize pot in relation to where it finished in the championship			0
@entity14 predicts that the new double points ruling could also have a negative impact on how this revenue is split			1
" the problem is by the time you get to the end of the season the majority of the teams are bust , " @entity14 continued			2
" so , this is only going to play into the hands of the stronger teams			0
" the days of a development push coming from anybody but the top three or four teams are gone			0
" the teams with financial strength will no doubt get the funding to consolidate their positions			0
" to me everything is virtually against the field at large with this regulation change			0
" what remains to be seen is whether the @entity101 or ( @entity2 chief executive ) @entity152 ( @entity153 ) pay double for the final race			1
" a number of other rule changes came out of this week 's @entity101 's @entity159 meeting in @entity160			2
the sport 's governing body renewed its plans to curb teams spending by announcing a global cost cap from january 2015			1
it did not , however , state what figure teams ' spending would be capped at			0
meanwhile , drivers will have to get their thinking caps on as , from 2014 , they will be asked to choose a race number between two and 99 to use for the rest of their careers			0
no. 1 will be reserved for the reigning world champion and if more than one driver chooses the same number then priority will be given to the driver finishing higher in the previous world championship			2
@entity184 racer @entity183 has already asked his followers on @entity186 to help him choose a number			0
the @entity101 also revealed that six teams -- @entity50 , @entity189 , @entity86 , @entity23 , @entity190 and @entity191 -- have agreed to take part in a three - day tire test in @entity194 next week			2
@entity2 tire supplier @entity195 and @entity189 got into hot water earlier this year for taking part in a unsanctioned tire test			0
this month 's tire test will be the first preparation for the major technical rule change that will reconfigure @entity2 in 2014 -- but the new points change in the final race could determine which team ends up winning the championship .			1

@entity2 drivers and teams can win double points at 2014 @entity9
*ex-racer* @entity14 says new ruling is a novelty which will only benefit big teams
world champion @entity51 describes new rule as " absurd "
