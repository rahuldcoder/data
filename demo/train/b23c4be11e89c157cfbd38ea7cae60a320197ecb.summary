@entity2 , @entity4 a year ago friday , violence in @entity2 's @entity1 , or @entity3 , reached a crescendo			1
some 49 people died and close to 100 more suffered gunshot wounds in what was the bloodiest day of violence in demonstrations against the country 's then @entity13 - leaning leader			1
soon enough , however , president @entity15 would flee the country , prompting @entity4 activists to declare " victory in the @entity1 " and promise a new day for a country long torn between its neighbors , @entity20 to the west and @entity13 to the east			1
today , the country is a powder keg driving spiraling tensions between the @entity28 and @entity29			1
a ceasefire between @entity4 forces and pro-russian separatists is in shambles			1
@entity34 , a town at the heart of the battle , is devastated			2
" now , it is finally clear that we struggled on @entity1 not against @entity15			0
he was just a cruel and obedient marionette , " president @entity40 said friday at a ceremony marking the one - year anniversary of the bloodshed			1
" @entity29 was preparing to the liquidation and tearing @entity4 apart long before the victory of @entity1			1
they were expecting the fall of @entity15 and accelerated the course of events , " @entity40 said to the families of protesters who died a year ago			0
@entity40 's speech was just part of a day of commemorations at the @entity2 square			2
the ceremony was to feature music , poetry , the lighting of candles and finally a concert friday evening			0
the president was to present awards to the families of activists who died			2
according to @entity4 prosecutors , 77 people died during the 2014 protests , which were sparked by @entity15 's decision to scrap a trade deal with the @entity72 and instead turn toward @entity13			1
forty - nine of those deaths came on february 20 , 2014 , when , according to protesters , government snipers opened fire on them			0
the street protests , which led to the ouster of @entity80 president @entity15 , triggered a chain of events that never could have been predicted			1
by march , @entity13 had annexed @entity4 's @entity83 peninsula			1
weeks later , in april , @entity80 separatist forces launched their bid to carve off the more @entity13 - leaning eastern @entity87 and @entity88 regions from the rest of @entity4			1
months of devastating fighting since have left nearly 5,700 people dead as of february 18 , the @entity91 @entity90 reported friday			0
more than 1 million people have been displaced , the @entity91 says			0
efforts to stop the fighting have met with limited success			0
the latest ceasefire agreement -- hammered out last week in @entity98 , @entity99 , among the leaders of @entity4 , @entity13 , @entity101 and @entity102 -- has faltered amid the bloody battle for @entity34			1
@entity4 's @entity105 and @entity104 said there had been 300 instances of violation of the ceasefire since it came into force sunday			1
heavy shelling , apparently from both sides , was heard thursday night in @entity87 , although it appeared to have eased friday morning			0
a separatist news agency said one woman died in the barrage			0
despite the spasms of violence , @entity102 chancellor @entity117 insisted that the @entity98 deal was still the best chance for peace			1
" it is difficult , it is slow and we had no illusions at all ... that it might not be all that easy and self - fulfilling , " she said , speaking alongside @entity101 president @entity128 at a news conference in @entity130			1
" but i still believe that it is right that we do everything we can to make sure that no further lives are lost			0
" @entity28 leaders have steadfastly accused @entity13 of failing to rein in separatists and of continuing to arm , supply and train them			0
@entity20 nations , the @entity139 and others have imposed sanctions on @entity13 interests in hopes of applying pressure on @entity145 to help end the hostilities			2
@entity13 denies claims by @entity2 and the @entity28 that it has armed and equipped the rebels and sent @entity13 troops to fight with them			0
@entity117 did not rule out potential for further sanctions on @entity29			1
but the aim of meeting in @entity98 was to find a solution , not impose sanctions , she said			0
@entity117 and @entity40 spoke by phone friday morning , and the @entity102 leader assured her @entity4 counterpart of her support			1
the @entity159 , which has observers on the ground tasked with monitoring the implementation of the ceasefire , has voiced concern about the lack of safe access to @entity34 , which it blames on the separatists			2
a @entity20 diplomat told @entity5 that the @entity159 mission is considering moving two of its four operational drones , currently stationed in @entity174 , to areas closer to @entity34 since they have been unable to enter the town			0
a strongly worded report issued by a committee of the @entity180 @entity179 said the @entity72 had underestimated the level of @entity13 animosity over moves to build closer @entity72 - @entity4 ties and had been slow to " adapt to the realities of the @entity13 we have today			1
" " @entity13 is increasingly defining itself as separate from , and as a rival to , the @entity72 , " the report by the @entity179 ' @entity188 said			0
" the @entity72 's relationship with @entity13 has for too long been based on the optimistic premise that @entity13 has been on a trajectory towards becoming a democratic ' @entity20 ' country			2
this has not been the case			0
" the report is also highly critical of the way in which competing national interests within the @entity72 made it hard to achieve a united policy on @entity13			0
if no progress is made in resolving the crisis , the @entity72 should use sanctions to target people close to @entity145 , rather than mid-ranking officials in @entity83 , the report said			0
it should also consider extending sanctions to the @entity13 financial sector			0
meanwhile , as politicians talk , @entity4 's civilians are bearing the brunt of the conflict			1
in addition to the death and destruction , the @entity91 says many @entity4 have exhausted their savings and have no access to jobs or health care			1
food prices have risen dramatically in the country 's war - torn east -- 30 % for staples such as bread and milk and 75 % to 80 % for meat and cheese , compared with last year			2
the @entity91 said its agencies had taken advantage of the ceasefire to deliver 62 metric tons of humanitarian aid to the @entity87 region on thursday , including winter clothes , blankets , drinking water and medical supplies			2
the @entity238 announced that it would increase its assistance to more than 110,000 people , over the next few months			0
but the agency said it would need $ 9 million to continue to provide aid through june			0
@entity5 's @entity243 reported from @entity2 , and @entity244 wrote and reported from @entity245			2
@entity5 's @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			2

@entity29 *planned* move against @entity4 before protests , @entity4 's president says
@entity102 leader says implementing a ceasefire is not easy but is still the best chance for peace
