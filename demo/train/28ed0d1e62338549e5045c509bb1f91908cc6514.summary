just a few hundred yards from the podium where @entity4 spoke to the roaring @entity6 faithful , 27 undecided @entity1 voters listened intently to his words			1
in their hands , they held electronic audience reaction dials , twisting them back and forth to record their approval or disapproval second by second , giving instant feedback and real - time ratings of the speech			2
this is the battlefront that will determine the election : the candidate who can win the holdouts -- the voters who have yet to make up their minds -- will likely win the whole race this fall			1
the group of voters was convened by @entity25 with the assistance of @entity27 in @entity29 communication professors @entity30 and @entity31			2
@entity25 hired the university to conduct the tests but the voters were not compensated			2
' gen xer ' @entity4 takes up torch , makes case to young voters though the group members declared themselves undecided , they were not neutral			1
in a series of dial test questions before the speech , the participants made it clear they are generally conservative , moderately religious and -- while most called themselves independent -- more leaned @entity6 than @entity46			0
seventy - eight percent of the people in the group rated the economy or the budget deficit as the top issue in the race			0
eighty - five percent indicated they believe the country is going in the wrong direction			0
in short , most of the dial - testers are ready to see a change in @entity60 's ways , but while they decidedly disapprove of president @entity62 's performance , they are ambivalent about whether @entity63 can or will do better			1
@entity4 's speech , however , seemed to give many of them at least a mild nudge in @entity63 's direction			1
nearly one in six @entity70 is living in poverty , the @entity6 congressman from @entity69 said to the cheering crowd in the convention hall			0
roundup : how did @entity4 do ? " @entity75 have graduated from college during the @entity62 presidency , ready to use their gifts and get moving in life			1
half of them ca n't find the work they studied for , or any work at all			0
" in the focus group , the men ate it up			0
the women lagged below the men in their approval until about halfway through the speech , when @entity4 began talking about his mother 's struggles to work and raise the family following the sudden death of @entity4 's father			1
" it was n't just a new livelihood			0
it was a new life			0
and it transformed my mom from a widow in grief to a small businesswoman whose happiness was n't just in the past			0
" by and large , all the dial testers responded strongly to @entity4 's references to hard work , initiative , and maintaining the @entity70 dream			1
the men and women split when he talked about rolling back health care reform ; men liking that idea more , women liking it less			0
but here is the tough truth for @entity120 : more than half the dial testers came into the evening indicating that if they had to vote right now , " undecided " would still win by a landslide			1
@entity4 a true son of @entity125 , @entity69			2

the candidate who can win undecided voters will likely win the election
most of the dial - testers are ready to see a change in @entity60 's ways
the testers respond strongly to @entity4 's references to hard work and initiative
