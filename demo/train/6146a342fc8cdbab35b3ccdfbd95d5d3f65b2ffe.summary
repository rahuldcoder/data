our galactic neighborhood just got a lot bigger			0
@entity3 on wednesday announced the discovery of 715 new planets , by far the biggest batch of planets ever unveiled at once			1
by way of comparison , about 1,000 planets total had been identified in our galaxy before wednesday			0
four of those planets are in what @entity3 calls the " habitable zone , " meaning they have the makeup to potentially support life			2
the planets , which orbit 305 different stars , were discovered by the @entity20 space telescope and were verified using a new technique that scientists expect to make new planetary discoveries more frequent and more detailed			2
" we 've been able to open the bottleneck to access the mother lode and deliver to you more than 20 times as many planets as has ever been found and announced at once , " said @entity24 , a planetary scientist at @entity3 's @entity25 in @entity26			2
launched in march 2009 , the @entity20 space observatory was the first @entity3 mission to find planets similar to @entity35 that are in , or near , habitable zones -- defined as planets that are the right distance from a star for a moderate temperature that might sustain liquid water			1
tuesday 's planets all were verified using data from the first two years of @entity20 's voyage , meaning there may be many more to come			1
" @entity20 has really been a game - changer for our understanding of the incredible diversity of planets and planetary systems in our galaxy , " said @entity46 , a scientist with @entity3 's astrophysics division			1
the new technique is called " verification by multiplicity , " and relies in part on the logic of probability			0
instead of searching blindly , the team focused on stars that the technique suggests are likely to have more than one planet in their orbit			0
@entity3 says 95 % of the planets discovered by @entity20 are smaller than @entity66 , which is four times as big as @entity35			1
one of them is about twice the size of @entity35 and orbits a star half the size of @entity35 's sun in a 30 - day cycle			0
the other three planets in habitable zones also are all roughly twice the size of @entity35			0
scientists said the multiplicity technique is biased toward first discovering planets close to their star and that , when further data comes in , they expect to find a higher percentage of new planets that could potentially have a life - supporting climate like @entity35 's			1
" the more we explore the more we find familiar traces of ourselves amongst the stars that remind us of home , " said @entity85 , a research scientist at the @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity26 , and co-leader of the research team .			0

four of 715 newly discovered planets may support @entity35 - like life
it 's the biggest single discovery of planets in *history*
all were found in the first two years of the @entity20 telescope 's voyage
@entity3 expects next batch of data to reveal more habitable planets
