" " for the last two months we 've been gradually rolling a preview of the new site out to our listeners , taking their feedback , fixing bugs and making improvements here and there , " @entity17 , @entity1 's founder , said in the post			2
" with all those little fixes and refinements in place , today we 're rolling out the new site for everyone			0
" among the new features on the site , which uses what creators call the " @entity35 " to predict users ' tastes based on the songs they 've already liked , are : -- simplified station creation -- a bigger focus on social interaction			1
enhanced user profiles let friends " like " or comment on what they 've been listening to and share songs or stations with friends on @entity1 as well as on @entity48 , @entity49 and other networking sites			1
-- more information about the song that 's playing and its artist -- including lyrics and detailed biographies			0
-- removing the 40 - hour per month listening cap to let users listen for as long as they want for free			1

loading times do seem faster , although not always instantaneous as promised			0
" the overhaul comes as sites like @entity91 and turntable.fm have emerged as hot new commodities in the increasingly crowded online music space			1
