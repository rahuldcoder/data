-- @entity1 should have spent sunday celebrating a friend 's wedding			1
instead he was toasting a fourth @entity5 title after beating major champions @entity6 and @entity8 in a playoff to clinch the @entity10			1
@entity1 , the 2011 @entity11 series victor , looked to have won the @entity13 tournament outright after shooting two - under - par 69 in his final round			1
but the new world no. 12 was pegged back after @entity6 , who was looking to secure back - to - back tour wins , and 2011 @entity17 winner @entity8 both birdied the par - four 18th to join him on seven under			1
@entity1 eventually sealed victory with a 45 - foot putt on the second additional hole , having earlier overhauled a two - stroke deficit on third - round leaders @entity6 and @entity8			1
" i 'm sure i 'll talk to him later and hopefully his day is even better than mine , " the 29 - year - old @entity1 told the @entity5 's official website when asked about missing friend @entity24 's big day			1
" it 's pretty sweet for both of us today			0
" i never expected to make a 40 - footer , especially in that situation			0
a little luck was involved			0
i guess it was meant to be			0
" it was n't just @entity1 who was surprised to see his effort find the cup , with both @entity6 and @entity8 expecting him to come up short			1
" @entity1 hit a tremendous putt , " the 41 - year - old @entity6 said			2
" we 're thinking it 's a very difficult three			0
it 's a defensive hole			0
you 're just trying to make four , believe it or not			0
" the 25 - year - old @entity8 added : " i did n't think he was going to make that one			2
i should have known , though , because he 's a great putter and a great player			0
" the victory means has @entity1 won a @entity5 title three years in a row , and moved him up to fifth in the early - season @entity11 standings			1
@entity1 was battling a partisan crowd at the @entity53 , with onlookers lending their backing to @entity13 native @entity6 -- a two - time winner of the event who was on a roll after clinching the @entity60 seven days before			1
" honestly ' @entity6 ' sounds really similar to ' @entity61 , ' so you just kind of pretend that maybe they 're for you , " said @entity1			2
" if i 'm at home , i 'm cheering for @entity65 " former world no. 2 @entity66 carded a stunning 64 to finish tied for fourth on five under , level with 10th - ranked @entity68 ( 71 ) , his fellow @entity70 @entity69 ( 69 ) and @entity72 's @entity71 ( 70 )			2
@entity70 trio @entity73 ( 70 ) , @entity74 ( 70 ) -- who is back this year after brain surgery -- and @entity76 ( 73 ) were tied for eighth on four under			2
@entity80 world no. 8 @entity78 ( 70 ) was part of a seven - way tie for 17th which also included 2007 @entity84 champion @entity84 ( 72 ) and last month 's @entity86 winner @entity85 ( 70 )			0
@entity88 world no. 1 @entity87 endured a torrid final round and carded eight bogeys on his way to a 78 which saw him finish seven over .			0
