@entity0 is trying to cut into the considerable lead president @entity2 had among @entity4 voters by showing that he is even more of a supporter of @entity6 than his rival			1
after suggesting the @entity2 administration threw @entity6 " under the bus , " @entity0 made an even stronger warning to @entity10 not to go nuclear , and pledged to move the @entity13 embassy from @entity14 to @entity15			1
@entity0 is hardly the only one who believes that the @entity4 vote swings to the candidate in presidential elections who is the most fervent supporter of @entity6			1
the same position was given voice in a 2007 book by two highly regarded political scientists , @entity23 , which suggests that @entity4 have undue influence over @entity13 foreign policy by making campaign contributions , pressuring members of @entity28 , and by casting their votes to support @entity6			1
a controversy erupted in 2011 - 12 concerning " @entity31 , " a term referring to @entity33 who are said to promote @entity6 policies to the point where they " put the interests of the @entity6 right above everything else , " as one writer put it			0
a recent survey shows that @entity0 will be disappointed			0
if @entity4 votes follow what this survey reveals , @entity2 will gain somewhat less support from @entity4 this year than he gained in 2008 -- but the same will be true for other groups of voters , including @entity50			1
and most @entity4 who will change the party they vote for will not " swing " because of his position on @entity6			1
opinion : are voters still picking leader of free world ? for the vast majority of @entity4 , @entity6 ranks surprisingly low in their considerations as voters			2
early in 2012 , the @entity61 found that among self - identified @entity4 adults , 51 % of those registered to vote cited the economy as the most important issue driving their voting decision			1
fifteen percent cited the growing gap between the rich and the poor , while 10 % cited health care and 7 % the deficit			0
only 4 % cited @entity6 as the most important issue to their vote			1
as @entity75 , executive director of the nonpartisan @entity76 , put it , " jews are multi-issue voters			0
the notion they are single - issue voters is simply wrong			0
" despite criticism of @entity2 's handling of the @entity6 - @entity83 conflict , for instance by three @entity86 scholars in the book @entity88 , approximately 60 % of @entity4 voters in the @entity61 survey reported a very favorable or mostly favorable view of @entity2 and said that they approve of the way he is doing his job			1
on the specific issue of how @entity2 is handling the @entity99 - @entity6 conflict , the survey found @entity4 voters to be divided : 20 % of the @entity4 surveyed said that they agree with the president 's policies and his execution of them , while 15 % reported that they agree with his policies but not his execution of them			1
twenty - eight percent reported that they disagree with his policies , while 36 % said that they are not sure of their opinion of how @entity2 is handling the conflict			2
indeed , evidence shows that @entity4 tend to vote as a group no more than -- and often less than -- several other key groups			0
a @entity115 poll conducted in 2011 found that 65 % of the @entity4 polled reported leaning @entity116 and 29 % reported leaning @entity117			0
the same poll found white evangelicals reporting a 70 - 24 split in favor of @entity117			0
eighty - eight percent of black @entity122 reported leaning @entity116 , with 6 % leaning @entity117			0
@entity123 leaned @entity117 by an 80 - 17 % margin and atheists leaned @entity116 by a 71 - 21 % margin			0
a @entity128 poll conducted in april also showed 70 % of @entity129 favoring @entity2 , with 20 % supporting @entity0 , and 10 % remaining undecided			2
opinion : both parties have a huge race problem all this is not to question that @entity4 care about @entity6 -- although many liberal @entity4 are very critical of its policies , and there are many liberal @entity4 -- just as @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and other @entity50 care about the nation they or their forefathers are from and to which they feel an ethnic affinity			2
however , to jump from noting such sentiments to the conclusion that therefore members of these groups will put these concerns above their commitment to @entity13 or allow these concerns to determine their vote must be supported by data			0
at least in the case of the @entity4 vote , data show the opposite is the case			2
@entity6 is a decisive factor in shaping the vote of only 4 out of 100 @entity4 voters			1
@entity0 's campaign team better keep its @entity163 bottles corked .			0

@entity0 is trying to outdo president @entity2 in his support for @entity6 , says @entity166
it 's a myth that the @entity4 vote goes to whoever supports @entity6 more fervently , @entity166 says
only 4 % of @entity13 @entity4 cite @entity6 as their most important voting issue , he says
and 51 % of those registered to vote cited the economy as the most important issue , he says
