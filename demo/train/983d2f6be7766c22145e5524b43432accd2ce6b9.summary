vice president @entity0 is n't buying the growing consensus heading into @entity2 that @entity3 are poised to take control of the @entity5			1
" i do n't agree with the oddsmakers , " @entity0 said in an exclusive interview with @entity8 chief political analyst @entity7			1
" i predict we 're gon na ... keep the @entity5			0
" but even if @entity3 do win the chamber for the first time in nearly a decade , @entity0 did n't seem to think the victory would have much impact on the administration 's priorities			1
" i do n't think it would change anything , in terms of what we 're about , " he told @entity7			2
" we know what we have to get done the last two years			0
and -- quite frankly -- going into 2016 , the @entity3 have to make a decision whether they 're in control or not in control			1
are they gon na begin to allow things to happen ? or are they gon na continue to be obstructionists ? and i think they 're gon na choose to get things done			0
" @entity0 's comments come as @entity3 appear to have the momentum going into tuesday 's elections			1
new polls over the weekend showed key races moving in the @entity3 's favor , especially in @entity37 , where @entity3 @entity5 candidate @entity39 's lead over the @entity41 candidate is growing			2
the vice president has played a crucial role for the administration during this election season , appearing with @entity41 candidates across the country at a time when president @entity50 's popularity is waning			1
@entity0 was in @entity51 this weekend campaigning with @entity41 gubernatorial candidate @entity52 as part of a trip that also took him to @entity55 and @entity56			1
@entity0 's rigorous campaign schedule has raised questions about whether he might run for president in 2016 , particularly if @entity60 decides to enter the race			1
though @entity0 would n't say whether he would run for president , he made clear that he would n't base the decision on @entity65 's plans			1
" that 's not the reason not to run or to run , " he told @entity7			1
" the question is ... am i convinced i am best positioned of anyone else to lead the country the next four years ? " in the more immediate future , @entity0 said he did n't see the @entity72 changing how it does business if the @entity3 wins the @entity5 majority			1
" we have to be more direct and clear about exactly what it is we 're looking to do , " he said			0
" and look , we 're -- we 're ready to compromise			0
@entity0 added : " i think they 're gon na be inclined -- because the message from the people , and i 'm gettin ' it all over the country , is they 're tired of @entity82 not being able to do anything			1
" while @entity0 has traveled to dozens of races this year , @entity50 has mostly stayed in @entity82 because many democrats in tight races did not want him to campaign with them			1
that , @entity0 said , is up to individual lawmakers			1
" it all gets down to what the specific issues in that -- in that district are , or that state is			0
and each senator makes a judgment about whether or not it 'll be- - he thinks it 's helpful or hurtful , " he told @entity8			2
one reason @entity41 are facing such headwinds this year is because of polls showing voters angry , afraid and mad at @entity82			0
" the public is concerned and frightened because it 's a frightening world			2
a lot has happened , " he responded , pointing out that problems that are eased or resolved -- such as the crisis in @entity106 -- get less attention			0
so should the public not be worried ? " i think the public should not be as anxious as they are , " @entity0 told @entity7			1
" but it 's understandable why they are			2
there is no existential threat to the @entity116 right now			0
there are fewer than five cases of @entity119 in the entire @entity116			0
the @entity116 public gains confidence in the fact of the way this is being handled ; that science does matter			0
" he went on : " you look at what 's happening with @entity129			2
@entity129 is not an existential threat to something happening to someone in the @entity116			0
it 's a serious problem overseas but it 's confusing and frightening			2
and it 's totally understandable			2
we 've got ta figure out -- we , the president and i , have to figure out how to better communicate exactly what 's being done			1
that 's part of the problem			2
that 's part of the dilemma " as 2016 chatter intensifies , @entity0 said he is focused on his job right now			1
" there 's plenty of time to make that decision , " he said			1
i mean , look , everybody talks about how , you know , everything is gon na be gone by the summer			0
and i do n't see that at all			2
" @entity7 asked where he is in his decision making process			0
" i just have n't focused on ( it ) , " he said			0
" i have n't made up my mind what i 'm gon na do			0
" @entity0 said persistent questions about a possible @entity65 campaign do n't upset him			1
" it really does n't bother me at all , " he said			0
but he has some ideas about what a campaign might look like			0
" i mean if i run , i 'm confident i will be able to mount a campaign that ( is ) ... gon na be credible , " he said			0
" and i 'm gon na be serious			0
