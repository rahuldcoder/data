@entity0 , @entity1 -- the road is n't easy -- past shelling and eerie separatist checkpoints			1
but where it leads is harder still			0
twelve days after @entity10 was blown out of the sky , pieces of the plane remain here , but for days investigators have n't been able to reach the site			0
on wednesday , efforts to get to the bottom of the deadly crash hit another roadblock , as @entity1 officials warned of possible landmines near the site			1
the wreckage sits in tomb - like silence -- a monument to cruelty , to how 298 souls -- some shipped in parts , away on a separatist train -- have yet to find complete rest			1
there are flowers and a teddy bear on the ground , where strangers have tried to mourn			0
the crash site still reeks of jet fuel and the stench of decay			1
shrapnel holes are visible in the cockpit 's remains			0
in the hour a @entity2 team spent at the crash site wednesday , there were no separatists , inspectors or @entity1 soldiers there			1
just distant smoke that explains why the inspectors ' large convoy has not , for the fourth day running , arrived			0
@entity1 's @entity50 claimed wednesday that " terrorists " -- the term it uses to describe rebels -- have set up firing positions and laid mines on the access road to the crash site of @entity55 17			1
the @entity1 government and @entity62 rebels are fighting over control of eastern @entity1			2
@entity65 investigators in @entity1 did not mention mines but announced wednesday that unsafe conditions kept their contingent from visiting the crash site for the fourth straight day			1
@entity2 could not independently confirm the veracity of the statement by the @entity1 officials , though @entity2 's team traveled to and from the debris field safely wednesday			1
the dangers in the area make the work of international experts " impossible , " the @entity1 defense council said			2
workers with the @entity81 made the same call and avoided traveling to the crash site wednesday			1
@entity84 , chief monitor of the @entity85 to @entity1 , said he would like to see a cease - fire between combatants so investigators can work			1
it was the fourth straight day the @entity81 has joined the 50 - strong team of @entity65 and @entity92 investigators in declaring the region too dangerous to work in			1
@entity65 investigators have yet to lay eyes on the wreckage or the human remains believed still to be strewn across the huge debris field near the town of @entity99			1
@entity2 's team reported seeing three or four points of smoke from artillery fire			1
because the area was militarized before the plane crash , it was not possible to know whether those firing positions were new			0
some human remains could still be found at the crash site , as well as belongings from the victims scattered about			1
on the journey there , the @entity2 team -- which was traveling in just one car , as opposed to the convoy of dozens of vehicles that the investigators use -- saw only a small rebel presence on the road around the wreckage			1
@entity122 and @entity1 officials have said that a @entity124 - made missile system was used to shoot down @entity10 from rebel territory on july 17			1
@entity124 and the rebels have disputed the allegations and blamed @entity1 for the crash			2
@entity65 prime minister @entity130 asked @entity1 president @entity131 in a phone call tuesday morning to halt the fighting around the crash site so that investigators can access it , @entity130 spokesman @entity129 said			1
@entity1 foreign minister : the bitter lessons of @entity138 @entity124 isolation there are echoes of the @entity142 as @entity62 rebels battle @entity1 government forces in the nation 's east			2
with new sanctions announced by the @entity149 and @entity122 against @entity124 this week , the stakes are getting higher , and @entity150 is getting more isolated			2
a senior administration official said @entity124 has n't been this isolated " since the end of the @entity142			0
" the @entity154 said the latest round of @entity122 sanctions " will cause nothing but the harm " to @entity122 - @entity124 ties and " will create a poor environment in international affairs where the cooperation between our countries often plays a key role			2
" the @entity124 response accused the @entity122 of " trying to avoid responsibility " for the crisis in @entity1 and blamed the @entity1 government for the violence in the east			2
on wednesday , @entity124 lawmaker @entity172 , the head of the @entity174 's foreign affairs committee , said via @entity175 that @entity122 president @entity182 " will make history not as a peacekeeper , everyone forgot about his @entity179 , but as the statesman who started a new cold war			0
" but @entity182 downplayed the comparison tuesday			0
" it 's not a new @entity142 , " he said			0
" what it is is a very specific issue related to @entity124 's unwillingness to recognize that @entity1 can chart its own path			2
" the new and harder - hitting sanctions show the @entity192 's waning patience with @entity124 over its disputed annexation of @entity194 , its support of @entity62 rebels and the impact of the shoot - down of @entity199 , which had many @entity200 among the 298 people on board when it went down in eastern @entity1			1
the new @entity149 sanctions aim to target eight " cronies " of @entity208 and three " entities " by limiting their access to @entity149 capital markets , an @entity149 official said on condition of anonymity			1
entities facing sanctions , according to the @entity149 , include the @entity214 ; the state - owned @entity216 corporation , which manufactures anti-aircraft weaponry ; and @entity218 , a subsidiary of a @entity124 state - owned airline			1
three state - owned banks were named tuesday by @entity223 , meaning five of the top six financial institutions in @entity124 were on the sanctions list , according to a senior @entity182 administration official			2
furthermore , the @entity122 went to @entity228 with a claim that @entity124 has violated its obligations under the @entity231			0
the treaty prohibits that possession , production or flight - test of a ground - launched cruise missile with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers			0
in a statement , @entity228 asked @entity124 to resolve the issue			0
to punish @entity124 , @entity200 must be prepared to suffer a parental quest although heavy fighting has blocked investigators from getting to the crash site , it did n't stop the determined parents of one of the victims			1
@entity248 and @entity249 braved the regional conflict and saw the wreckage over the weekend			0
" we have been always protected , " @entity252 said			0
" i believe it was divine guidance			0
" " we really , really promised our daughter that we will go there and that we tried to really fulfill our promises , " said @entity249			0
despite there being no known survivors , the couple holds out hope that their daughter , @entity263 , a 25 - year - old aerospace engineer , is still alive			0
" @entity263 can only be pronounced dead when the dna is matched with her body , " @entity249 said			0
" so if anybody says at the moment she is dead ... it 's not correct			0
" up to this point , very few of the bodies recovered from the crash have been identified by @entity65 authorities			2
as of monday , 227 coffins had been sent to the @entity65 , where forensic investigators are working to identify victims			0
it is unclear how many complete sets of bodies the coffins contain			0
how rebels built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies what will @entity138 crash investigators find at site ? @entity122 , @entity149 coordinate on @entity124 sanctions , but will they work ? @entity2 's @entity286 reported from @entity0 ; @entity287 and @entity288 wrote and reported in @entity289			1
@entity2 's @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 and journalist @entity302 in @entity303 contributed to this report .			2
