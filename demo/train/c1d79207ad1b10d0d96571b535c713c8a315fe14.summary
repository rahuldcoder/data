when photographer @entity1 first visited @entity2 , he found a nation filled with hope			1
he found citizens worn out by decades of war -- but looking forward to an independent , peaceful future			2
that was two years ago , after the world 's youngest country split from its northern nemesis , @entity2			1
" i remember the look on people 's faces , " @entity1 said			1
" tired but happy , hopeful for a better future after a past full of pain and war			2
" his return in february was anything but			2
this time , @entity1 found a nation on the brink of an abyss			1
instead of jubilant faces of hope , he saw defeated faces haunted by a return of ghosts of past wars			2
months of ethnic violence had left thousands dead , 1.5 million people displaced and a looming famine , according to the @entity33			1
@entity1 found despair cramped in tent camps , growing sexual violence and the recruitment of child soldiers			1
he described the violence in @entity2 as an " invisible " conflict			1
" it represents one of the longest and most forgotten @entity44 wars , " he said			2

given the tragic consequences and repercussions on the population , i find it essential to bring it to light			0
" his goal , he said , is to tell the stories of people rendered powerless by wars , provide objective images and shed light on human rights issues			0
" it 's hard to find front - line war photography of the kind we 've seen in @entity65 or @entity66 , " @entity1 said			1
" the images in @entity2 are different			1
