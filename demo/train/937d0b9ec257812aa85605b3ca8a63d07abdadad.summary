the lawyer for former @entity5 @entity4 , says the ousted beauty queen 's good name is " tarnished			1
" @entity4 , stripped of the @entity5 title last week , " suffered severe emotional distress " and her reputation was harmed by @entity6 , @entity15 said in a letter sent thursday to @entity6 ' lawyer			1
@entity15 's letter also accused @entity6 , whom he referred to as a " gay activist , " of setting @entity4 up to be fired because of her statements opposing same - sex marriage			1
when @entity4 , 22 , was dethroned , @entity6 said it was for " contract violations , " including missed public appearances			2
he told @entity2 's @entity29 last week that it was n't one thing @entity4 did , but " many , many , many things			1
" " she came to us and said i 'm not interested in your input ; i 'll make my own decision what i 'm going to do , " @entity6 said			0
" you know , when you have a contract , when you 're working for someone , you have a responsibility to follow through on what that requirement is			0
" @entity6 told @entity29 it was clear " she was not interested in upholding the title or the responsibilities			0
" " @entity4 's good name has been tarnished by your client 's false and defamatory accusations , " the letter from her lawyer to @entity6 ' said			1
" please view this letter as a last opportunity for mr. @entity6 to retract the defamatory statements made against my client and to seek to restore her good name , " @entity15 said			1
" if he does not comply , i will have no alternative but to recommend that ms. @entity4 proceed to do so through litigation			2
" in response to the letter , @entity6 issued a statement that said : " mr. @entity15 obviously has never watched ' @entity66 ' if he believes that mr. @entity67 could be so easily fooled			2
facts are facts , and we stand by them			0
" @entity15 denied any contract violations , saying it was a " complete and utter pretext " for her firing			0
the list @entity6 gave to reporters of @entity4 's missed appearances was " an outright fraud , " he said			1
@entity4 " did not refuse reasonable appearance requests " that could " be expected to promote and further the intended purposes of @entity5 , " he said			1
the beauty queen expected to be asked to attend " rotary conventions and avocado festivals , " not events @entity6 suggested , @entity15 said			0
" she did not think it was appropriate for her to accept mr. @entity6 ' invitation to attend a gay documentary in @entity88 promoting same - sex marriage , " he said			0
" it was not my client 's job , as @entity5 , simply to help your client promote his personal or business interests as a @entity88 agent and producer , or gay activist			2
" he accused @entity99 of trying to make commissions off @entity4 's appearances			1
" your client was trying to wrongfully profit off of my client 's participation as @entity5 , in violation of her contract , by taking 20 percent of any appearance fee she would earn , such as at the @entity111 jewelers convention she attended at his request , " @entity15 's letter said			1
@entity15 cited a statement he said @entity6 made during a may 15 conference call that " clearly shows that your client was trying to ' set - up ' our client for termination " by relaying an offer to appear semi-nude in @entity121			0
three people who worked for a public relations agency representing @entity4 at the time heard it , he said			0
" all three of those people distinctly remember @entity6 talking about sending ms. @entity4 an offer to do a @entity121 photo shoot ' so when they take her title away , she does n't sue me , ' " he said			0
@entity15 said @entity6 -- and former co-executive director @entity132 -- were " bound and determined to get her fired , and they have now finally gotten their way			2
" @entity135 pageant owner @entity67 announced last month that @entity4 could keep her title despite a controversy over topless photos , missed appearances and her statements against same - sex marriage			2
@entity67 reversed himself last week			0
" i told @entity4 she needed to get back to work and honor her contract with the @entity5 organization , and i gave her the opportunity to do so , " @entity67 said			1
" unfortunately , it just does n't look like it is going to happen , and i offered @entity6 my full support in making this decision			0
