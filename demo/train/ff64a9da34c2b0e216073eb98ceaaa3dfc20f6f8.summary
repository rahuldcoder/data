@entity0 , @entity1 -- the next time you pull into a parking garage and the attendant gives you the once - over , he or she may be taking note of more than just the shiny rear spoiler on your new car			2
as part of a new government initiative , parking lot attendants and other transportation workers are being trained as the next line of defense in the fight against terrorism			1
the first observer program was introduced to parking lot professionals at a @entity24 , @entity25 , convention in may , days after a vendor in @entity20 's @entity19 spotted a suspicious vehicle and helped thwart what could have been a deadly terrorist attack			1
full coverage of @entity19 plot the @entity19 incident highlighted the need for ordinary citizens to be trained to become extra eyes and ears of law enforcement , according to officials involved in the program			1
" no matter how banal it seems , if something seems different to you or suspicious , we want you to report it , " said @entity39 , a former @entity40 and @entity41 agent			2
@entity39 led the @entity21 's pilot training session monday in @entity0 , @entity1			0

" even in the eleventh hour we have an opportunity to make a difference			0
" the training is part of a $ 15.5 million program funded by the @entity68 and administered by the @entity50			2
under the program , transportation workers -- including parking lot employees and truck and school bus drivers -- are trained to be on the lookout for people taking photos or sketches of supportive beams in parking garages , people loading vehicles with numerous propane fuel tanks , and foul odors such as diesel fuel coming from a nondiesel - burning van -- which could signal an ammonium nitrate bomb			1
" we are not trying to turn you into @entity93 , " @entity39 said at the @entity0 training session , referring to @entity89 's role as a counterterrorism agent in the tv series " 24			2
" " we like who you are as parking lot professionals			1

if citizens would have reported red flags such as @entity110 's improperly parked getaway car ahead of the 1995 @entity112 bombing that killed 168 people , the attack may have never occurred , @entity39 said			1
witnesses who see red flags and do n't report them may live with guilt , he said			0

vehicles packed with explosives can easily elude authorities , he said			0
that 's why people such as parking lot attendants , who are more familiar with everyday activities , can be a great asset to counterterrorism operations			1
