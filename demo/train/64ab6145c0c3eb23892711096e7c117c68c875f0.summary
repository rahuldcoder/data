@entity0 -- @entity3 's lawyers returned to court tuesday to ask a @entity0 judge to keep her child 's father away from their daughter because of a @entity10 fight with @entity12 's fiance			1
the father , model @entity13 , claimed in a court filing monday that the fiance , @entity16 , ambushed him when he was dropping the daughter , 4 - year - old @entity17 , at @entity12 's @entity19 home			1
police arrested @entity13 , 37 , and charged him with misdemeanor battery , but he insisted he was not the aggressor in the fistfight , which sent him to a hospital			0
@entity12 , 46 , and @entity13 have been engaged in a bitter legal fight over custody of @entity17 since their five - year romance ended in 2010			1
the battle heated up last year after the @entity31 - winning actress announced her engagement to @entity16 and asked a family court to allow her to move with the daughter to @entity35			0
@entity13 , in a sworn statement that helped him gain a temporary restraining order against @entity16 on monday , said the fight in @entity12 's driveway last thursday morning was apparently motivated by the custody battle , which @entity12 recently lost			1
@entity12 , who pays @entity13 child support under the shared custody agreement , was told she can not move to @entity35 with the child unless @entity13 goes there as well			2
in his statement , @entity13 said : " while he was attacking me physically , mr. @entity16 said to me in an aggressive and threatening voice , ' you cost us $ 3 million			2
when you see the judge , you 're going to tell him you 're going to @entity35 or i 'm going to kill you			0
you 're going to @entity35 , you 're going to get your 20 grand a month in child support			0
from now on you 're going to do drop - offs on the street			0
' " @entity12 : i 'm so glad i waited to have @entity17 @entity13 's lawyer attached several photos to the filing to show his blackened , swollen eyes , cut lip and bruised face			1
@entity13 was treated at @entity63 for a fractured rib and several bruises on his face and forehead , and he required stitches to repair three cuts in his mouth , the filing said			0
in the statement , @entity13 said @entity16 first threatened him the day before , when @entity12 and the two men were visiting @entity17 's school			1
" @entity16 , who seemed very angry and agitated , suddenly started speaking to me in @entity74 , and spouted off things such as , ' i wish i could beat the s * * t out of you right now			0
you 're lucky we 're in a school right now , " his statement said			0
the next morning , when @entity13 was parked in @entity12 's gated driveway to hand over his daughter to the nanny to spend @entity10 with her mother , @entity16 approached him and said , " we need to talk , " @entity13 said			1
" all of a sudden , mr. @entity16 jumped on me on the side of my body , and punched me such that he had taken me down to the ground , " @entity13 said in the sworn statement			2
" he continued to punch me at least two or three times , kicked me in the ribs with his knee or foot , and took my head in his hands and slammed it to the concrete driveway			0
it all happened so suddenly , i did not see mr. @entity16 's actions coming , and thus , i was not ready for it and was not able to defend myself			2
" @entity13 suggested that police should look at video from the three security cameras in @entity12 's driveway " before she and mr. @entity16 deleted them			1
" it was unclear if such video exists or if police have it			0
if so , it could be key evidence on december 13 when @entity13 is in court to face the battery charge and on december 17 when he seeks to make permanent the temporary restraining order issued monday banning @entity16 from harassing , intimidating or contacting him			1
tuesday 's hearing , in which @entity12 hopes to persuade a judge to order @entity13 to stay away from their daughter , will be in a closed courtroom .			2

a judge orders @entity12 's fiance to keep away from her ex , @entity13

photos show @entity13 's *injuries* , which says happened with @entity16 attacked
