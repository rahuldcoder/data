@entity0 -- the other hundred , a photo - book project featuring 100 photo stories of people across 91 countries , launched its first exhibition in @entity0 on thursday			1
the project takes aim at media rankings such as the @entity11 and is instead dedicated to people whose lives deserve recognition but who would never make the cut , said @entity17 , creator of the project and ceo of the @entity20 ( @entity21 ) , an independent @entity22 think tank based in @entity0			1
" the goal of the other hundred is both to inform and to provoke thought			1
the implication of many of the rich lists and articles put out by the media is that being rich is the only way to succeed or live a life of meaning			1
the reality is that the majority of the people are not rich and we wanted to tell their side of the story , " @entity17 said			1
" it 's ridiculous there are such lists like the world 's 100 most beautiful people when they really look nothing like me or you , " @entity17 added			2
@entity21 received 12,000 submissions from 1,500 photographers in 156 countries			0
@entity17 , together with five other judges selected 100 for the accompanying photo book , published in july			2
the book includes short essays by acclaimed writers , such as author @entity55 , renowned @entity57 poet @entity56 and award winning journalist @entity58			0
while the project aimed to shed light on the unspoken majority , @entity17 said that it does not attempt to celebrate poverty or criticize wealth			2
" we 're trying to provoke people to define for themselves what it means to have a rich and fulfilled life			1
we 're not trying to criticize those who seek material wealth , but the reality is that not everyone aspires to be rich , and not everybody can , " @entity17 said			2
" you can tell the world is crying out for a more nuanced look at the human condition			0
" one of the winning photographers , @entity80 , said that he appreciated how the project also challenged the commercialization of the editorial market for professional photographers like himself			0
" there 's a lot of pressure to deliver what the media wants and everybody at some point is going to bow down to it , " @entity86 said			0
" the project shows how life as it is for normal people and things as they truly are			1
" what was most important , said @entity17 , was photographers ' connection to the photo narratives			0
" we did n't want to pick the photographer who parachuted into @entity104 and got the photo of the exotic young girl in the shadows			0
we want a name to put to the faces and a story to tell , " @entity17 said			0
the exhibition will move next to @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 in 2014			1
@entity21 plans to follow the project with " @entity117 " in 2015 .			0
