the unmanned capsule came down about 250 miles west of @entity11 at 3:22 p.m. , the space agency reported			1
the craft was launched october 7 , the first of a dozen flights to the space station planned under a contract with @entity1			1
the craft carried nearly 900 pounds of supplies to the station and returned with nearly 1,700 pounds of freight , mostly used hardware and scientific research material			1
the reusable craft has been loaded onto a ship and was carried back to shore sunday afternoon , @entity2 said			2
@entity1 chose @entity2 's @entity25 launch vehicle and the @entity2 spacecraft to resupply the space station in 2008			1

" with today 's mission , we 've closed the loop and demonstrated that @entity40 industry is ready to step up to the plate and meet our needs for transport to low @entity8 orbit , " @entity1 administrator @entity33 said in a statement issued after splashdown			1
" this work will transform our relationship to space , save money and create jobs			0
@entity40 remains the leader in space and technology development			1
" another company , @entity53 , is expected to launch its own demonstration flight to the space station within months under a contract with @entity1			2
and @entity2 is one of three aerospace firms now vying for a contract for manned flights into orbit , along with @entity62 and @entity63			0
the mission was completed despite the failure of one of the nine engines on the @entity25 booster rocket that carried it into orbit			2
@entity2 said the engine failed 79 seconds after liftoff , but the remaining engines kept the craft headed for the space station as flight computers made the necessary adjustments			0
however , a prototype communications satellite that the @entity25 9 carried as a secondary payload did not end up in its designated orbit			0
the satellite 's builder , @entity83 - based @entity81 , said controllers were able to successfully test the device 's systems before it fell out of orbit and plans to launch two more of them aboard @entity2 rockets by 2014			0
@entity2 said it was studying flight data with @entity1 to figure out what happened , " and we will apply those lessons to future flights			0
