@entity0 -- @entity2 seems to be seeing some splendid days			1
this past week the @entity3 hurdled over the 14,500 mark and near a five - year high , while the yen weakened beyond the 100 - yen mark against the dollar and to a four - year low			0
if that was n't enough , @entity2 's exporters have started to pick up the black pen to report earnings where only red had been used in the past several years -- @entity14 this week revealed its first full - year net profit in five years			1
with investors and exporters feeling the cash surge , the potential for change is at hand but challenges still lie in wait			0
analysts warn that parts of @entity26 are still very much on the brink			0
@entity2 tech : ' they dropped the ball ' " the weakening yen is benefiting @entity2 's technology companies but it 's not going to get them back to where they used to be five to ten years ago , " says @entity30 , senior director and @entity32 at @entity33			1
" fundamentally , the reason why @entity39 , @entity14 and @entity40 are speculative grade now ... is basically because of a loss of tech leadership			1
they missed out on tablets and phones			0
they dropped the ball on key products			0
we 've yet to see them come up with compelling products			0
" teasing apart , @entity14 's annual earnings statement for the fiscal year that ended march 31 , the company finished the year with a profit of $ 435 million only because it sold assets worth more than $ 1.9 billion dollars			1
" excluding those , then @entity14 is making a big loss , " says @entity58 , director of @entity33 's @entity59 , " so it does n't mean they will return the cash to shareholders or retire their debt at an accelerated pace -- but that they intend to invest in strategically important businesses			1
" those businesses may involve bulking up @entity14 's relatively small imaging business , including cameras and sensors , and its music and movie divisions			2
recent cinema hits that helped @entity14 , include the latest @entity76 installment " @entity82 , " which pulled in more than $ 1 billion at the global box office , along with the " @entity81 " movie trilogy with @entity79 and the " @entity81 " reboot in 2012			1
the question , however , is will @entity14 's leadership send funds that foster more growth in such divisions ? " the short answer is ' we 'll have to see '			2
it 's too early to say whether the company is going down that path on focusing on a small number of profitable products , " says @entity30			0
" at one stage last year , people were seriously debating whether @entity14 should stop making tvs			2
i remain to be convinced if they can make a profit , but in their latest statement they seem to be committed to the television segment and believe they can grow sales and return to profit			2
and if they can , i congratulate them			0
" @entity14 's television division has been a loss maker over the past several years , adds @entity30 , as has @entity14 's flagship smartphone , the @entity111 " by all accounts it 's a good phone			1
it 's one of the sturdiest phones on the market			0
but i think i only know two people who use it , " he adds			0
of @entity2 's tech firms , @entity33 only ranks @entity14 , @entity40 and @entity39			1
all three have speculative ratings with negative outlooks			0
@entity2 autos : ' they 're back to compete ' while the forecast for a resurgence in @entity2 technology innovation appears in doubt , the prediction for @entity2 's automobile exports seems more enthusiastic as the yen has weakened			1
in @entity135 's recent earnings report for the fiscal year ended march 31 , the world 's biggest automaker reported net income of $ 9.7 billion -- more than triple its earnings from the year prior			1
" @entity2 automakers have regained confidence and momentum			2
in the auto industry , momentum is everything , " says @entity142 , president of @entity143 and @entity144 and author of @entity146 wheels , @entity148 roads			1
" this is n't a temporary blip			0
they 're back to compete			0
" still , adds @entity143 , @entity2 's auto sector faces growth challenges because of regional politics in @entity158 , global competition and a lack of innovation which a weaker yen can not help			1
chronic tensions between @entity2 and @entity148 over territorial disputes in the @entity165 have dampened demand for @entity2 automobiles in @entity148 , the world 's largest car market			1
" they ( @entity2 automakers ) will sell three million cars there this year but it could be much higher			2
if they get things right , within five years it could easily get to five million , " says @entity143			0
" dealers say a good benchmark is showroom traffic			0
in @entity148 , because of the tension , dealers i know say in october and november of last year that showroom traffic at @entity2 dealerships was down by half			1
" competition from @entity186 and @entity187 's @entity188 automakers -- @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 -- has also been rising			1
to push back , @entity143 says using new - found profits from a weaker yen to move manufacturing plants to cheaper locales overseas is one way to stay competitive -- as long as the pace of expansion is controlled			1
" one thing is @entity135 began an aggressive schedule to open more production bases overseas but that was the beginning of its problems			2
to duplicate the quality and fastidiousness of @entity2 plants was difficult			2
they were running to be number one at the expense of quality			0
" @entity135 's well - documented crises of quality from 2009 and 2010 set the company back in consumers ' eyes , says @entity143 , which has led to challenges from other carmakers			2
" the threat from ( @entity186 's ) @entity221 has been well documented			2
@entity146 automakers have boosted quality , innovation and styling too , " says @entity143			2
" for example , the @entity226 has been a spectacular success			0
it was the best - selling model in 2012 but @entity135 's @entity230 had perennially been the best - selling car over the ten years before that			1
" but @entity143 adds @entity135 is slowly regaining customer trust after a series of recalls			0
in december 2012 , @entity135 agreed to pay $ 1.1 billion to settle a class - action suit by car owners who claimed they suffered economic losses because of unintended acceleration in its cars			1
that same month , the company also agreed to pay a record $ 17.4 million to the @entity146 @entity242 for problems that led to a 2012 recall in one of its @entity247 models			1
as for direction at the world 's largest automaker , @entity143 says he has heard good things about the leadership style of @entity135 's president and ceo that aims to foster innovation			0
" i hear @entity257 enters a room with an entourage of extremely bright engineers and colleagues but he also says ' do n't get too burrowed in ' and ' let 's open our eyes and see what we can do differently '			0
it seems there 's an awakening among the @entity2			0

weaker @entity2 yen boosting *equities* , exporter profits , investor *sentiment*
@entity14 reported first annual profit in five years ; @entity135 reported $ 9.7b annual profit
fitch : @entity2 tech will not benefit enough from weaker yen for return to competitiveness
analyst : @entity2 auto sector challenged by @entity148 politics , @entity186 , @entity146 competition
