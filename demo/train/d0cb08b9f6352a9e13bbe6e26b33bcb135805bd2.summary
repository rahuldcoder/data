the @entity81 missed a late spot - kick in last weekend 's home defeat by @entity84 , but was on target this time for his 26th league goal this season to be @entity90 's leading scorer alongside @entity91			2
@entity77 , boosted by the 2 - 2 draw with @entity1 in the midweek first leg of their @entity95 semifinal , leveled in the 38th minute as @entity96 made up for his early handball			2
@entity98 then fired the winner with a penalty right on halftime after @entity102 went down under the challenge of @entity104			0
@entity84 could have moved into fourth above @entity45 , but lost 2 - 0 at home to @entity47 in a blow to the club 's @entity108 hopes			1
on - loan @entity19 striker @entity110 scored in the 13th and final minutes to lift his side three points above the relegation zone			0

the result lifted @entity122 two points clear of the relegation zone			0
@entity29 moved out of the bottom three on goal difference above @entity137 thanks to a 59th - minute winner from striker @entity139 at @entity6			2
@entity137 lost 4 - 2 at @entity140 despite a first - half double from striker @entity142 , as on - loan striker @entity145 and @entity59 international @entity144 both scored twice for the 10th - placed home side			0
@entity147 moved up to ninth with a 2 - 1 win at @entity150 thanks to two goals from midfielder @entity152 , while @entity153 moved two points clear of the bottom three with a 2 - 0 win at @entity156 .			1
