-- president @entity1 entered office with two overriding legislative goals : health care reform and climate change mitigation			1
he obtained the first goal but not the second			0
now he has to decide whether the laws that @entity10 passes pose any constraint on his actions , or whether those laws are simply vessels whose precise contents can be filled as the president sees fit			2
on tuesday , two federal courts rendered contrasting decisions regarding the legality of subsidies paid to those who have obtained insurance through the federal exchange established under the @entity25 , the @entity25 legislation that a deeply divided @entity10 passed in 2009			2
the act contains a provision authorizing federal subsidies to low - income individuals who purchase insurance through a " state " health exchange			2
the question that the two courts had to answer was whether the specific statutory reference to state exchanges precludes subsidies to those who obtained insurance coverage through the federal exchange			0
the @entity40 ruled 2 - 1 that such subsidies were not permitted ; the @entity42 , the federal appeals court based in nearby @entity43 , held that the subsidies were allowed			0
the conflicting decisions reflect conflicting views of what counts as the law			0
according to the @entity40 's majority , the law is contained in the plain language of a statute			2
but according to the @entity43 - based court , the law consists of what @entity10 intended to do when it enacted the @entity25			1
for its part , the @entity1 administration emphasizes what @entity10 intended instead of what @entity10 actually wrote and passed			2
when @entity59 press secretary @entity58 was asked if " the letter of the law matters to the @entity59 on this , " he responded that " what the courts are charged with doing is evaluating the intent of @entity10			0
" that approach would save the subsidies that underpin the @entity25 , but it would doom the administration 's approach to climate change			1
when @entity1 took office , he asked @entity10 to enact sweeping federal legislation to combat climate change			1
the president insisted that such new legislation was necessary to respond to climate change -- indeed , some of his more zealous supporters argued that federal climate change legislation was necessary to save the world from destruction			1
but once @entity10 rebuffed his plea for such a law , @entity1 decided that maybe it was n't necessary after all			1
instead , he turned to the @entity82 , which @entity10 enacted in 1970 to reduce the clouds of air pollution that plagued so many @entity86 cities at the time			0
the intent of the @entity10 that passed the @entity82 was to empower the @entity88 to regulate emissions of substances that make people sick when they breathe them			0
that @entity10 did not even think about climate change , and the pollutants that @entity10 did contemplate are fundamentally different from greenhouse gases that occur naturally in the atmosphere , are not toxic when breathed even at the elevated levels that now exist in the atmosphere , and that cause harm indirectly by facilitating the greenhouse effect that has begun to change the world 's climates			1
if we were to follow @entity58 's advice and evaluate the intent of @entity10 , then the @entity82 would not apply to climate change			1
but the @entity106 read the @entity82 in the same way that the @entity109 federal appeals court read the @entity25			1
in the landmark 2007 decision of @entity113 v. @entity88 , the high court held the clear text of the @entity82 encompassed all sorts of air pollutants , not just those that were in the mind of @entity10 when it enacted the law			0
that broad understanding of the @entity82 forms the legal foundation for the @entity88 's ongoing regulation of greenhouse gas emitters and of @entity1 's @entity123			1
now @entity1 , a former adjunct law professor , faces a choice			1
if he defends efforts to interpret the @entity25 based on what @entity10 apparently intended rather than on the law 's actual provisions , then he undercuts the legal theory for his response to climate change			1
but if he defers to what the law actually says , then he loses the subsidies that are integral to the success of the @entity25			2
of course , the president could simply advance whatever legal theory suits his policy aims			0
we expect more from judges			0
and few judges have articulated the judicial task better than @entity143 , who remarked , " we do not inquire what the legislature meant ; we ask only what the statute means			0
" even if @entity58 would prefer otherwise			0
join us on @entity149 / @entity148 .			0

president @entity1 's team argues against a literal reading of the health care law
@entity155 : view may save @entity25 but flies in face of approach to climate change
@entity1 seeks to use decades - old law to regulate gases related to climate change
@entity155 : on climate change , @entity1 wants judges to read the law literally
