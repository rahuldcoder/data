a record number of people were deported from the @entity3 last year , federal officials announced tuesday			1
but does the @entity5 administration deserve all the credit -- or blame -- for this record ? and is it actually as impressive as it sounds ? critics say no to both questions , and charge the administration with creative accounting			1
president @entity5 himself may have inadvertently added fuel to the fire			1
" the statistics are actually a little deceptive , " @entity5 said last month during a discussion with @entity19 journalists			1
there has been " a much greater emphasis on criminals than non-criminals			0
" and " with stronger border enforcement , we 've been apprehending folks at the borders and sending them back			0
that is counted as a deportation even though they may have only been held for a day or 48 hours			2
" sen. @entity32 , @entity33 , noted @entity5 's remarks wednesday , saying he 's " frustrated about the administration 's deceptive marketing tactics in claiming that they have deported more undocumented people than ever before			1
" the administration is " playing a double game , " argued @entity41 , executive director of the @entity42 , which favors tighter immigration restrictions			2
" they 're telling ( pro-immigration ) advocacy groups that they 're focusing on the worst of the worst " by committing more resources to the most dangerous undocumented immigrants			0
" but they 're telling the broader public they 've achieved record levels of deportations			2
it 's a clever spin			0
" so what are the facts ? nearly 400,000 individuals were removed from the country in fiscal year 2011 , which ended september 30 , according to the @entity61 agency			2
@entity61 director @entity62 trumpeted the news , calling it the result of " smart and effective immigration enforcement " that depends on " setting clear priorities for removal and executing on those priorities			0
" the 396,906 figure is indeed a record -- but not by much			2
a total of 392,862 people were deported in 2010 -- a difference of little more than 1 % , according to @entity61			1
almost 390,000 people were deported the year before that			1
significantly larger increases in the total number of deportations occurred during @entity80 's administration			1
fewer than 120,000 people were deported in 2001 , when @entity80 took office			1
analysts say much of the change over the last decade has been due to the implementation of controversial federal - led measures such as @entity88 initiative and the @entity89 , which are designed to root out undocumented immigrants accused or convicted of various criminal acts			2
both measures predate @entity5 's presidency			1
recent state - led crackdowns on illegal immigrants in places like @entity99 -- despite all the media attention -- have played a less critical role , they insist			0
" there certainly has been a tremendous uptick in state activity in the realm of immigration enforcement " in recent years , said @entity102 , director of advocacy at the @entity104			0
but " in terms of what 's driving enforcement , it 's ( still ) really a federal - led issue			0
" producing new deportation records -- however slim the margin -- appears to be a priority for the @entity5 @entity117			1
pundits argue the ability to tout such records could be political gold for a @entity123 president wooing independent voters in 2012 , though it does risk alienating @entity5 's liberal base			1
a @entity128 story from last december said administration " officials quietly directed immigration officers to bypass backlogged immigration courts and time - consuming deportation hearings whenever possible " in order to break the record for fiscal year 2010			1
" @entity136 ( also ) told immigration officers to encourage eligible foreign nationals to accept a quick pass to their countries without a negative mark on their immigration record , " the story concluded			0
@entity62 told the @entity128 everything had been done " on the merits " and with " no cooking of the books			0
" under @entity5 , the budget for @entity61 's @entity148 -- the money spent to identify , apprehend , detain and remove individuals from the country -- has actually remained relatively static , rising from $ 2.63 billion in fiscal year 2009 to $ 2.77 billion in fiscal year 2011			1
immigration officials are currently funded " to remove around 400,000 people based on the resources we 're given by @entity157 , " an @entity61 official told @entity158			2
what has changed most recently is " the level of sophistication in finding folks who pose a public safety threat and are eligible for removal			0
" @entity61 stressed tuesday that over half of the roughly 397,000 people deported last year had been convicted of felonies or misdemeanors			1
that 's an 89 % increase in deported criminals from three years ago , the agency said			0
and in august , the @entity172 announced its intention to individually review roughly 300,000 pending deportation cases in federal immigration courts			0
lower priority cases -- those not involving individuals considered violent or otherwise dangerous -- will be suspended , the department said			0
administration officials call it a matter of prioritizing cases and allocating scarce resources more efficiently			2
critics call it backdoor amnesty , a way to push through policy changes that conservatives in @entity157 would never agree to			1
if the administration is trying to walk a political tightrope , it may end up pleasing nobody			0
conservatives like @entity41 insist deportations would be increasing at a much faster rate if @entity5 pushed for more funding for @entity61			1
@entity199 like @entity102 worry that undocumented immigrants who pose no threat to others are nevertheless at increased risk being rounded up by more aggressive @entity61 officials			0
" this has all been part of the administration 's strategy to advance reforms on immigration that include tough enforcement as well as providing a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country , " @entity102 said			0
" but unfortunately that latter component has now fallen off			0

*adminstration* officials say they deported a record number of people last year
critics say @entity5 deserves little credit , and that deportation numbers are basically flat
critics have accused the administration of taking steps in the past to *inflate* deportation numbers
liberals and conservatives are concerned over current deportation policy
