-- @entity1 is n't fully retiring , but " @entity4 " has still given the veteran journalist a send - off to remember			1
on friday 's show , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 made surprise appearances as they all joined the current " view " co-hosts in wishing @entity1 well as she leaves on - camera work behind			1
" i want to start by saying i ca n't believe this day has come and i ca n't believe it 's for real , " @entity13 told @entity1			1
" because i do n't know what we 're all going to do without seeing you go from one place to another , asking questions that we 'd all like to ask			0
" true to form , @entity1 snuck in a few more of those questions friday , asking @entity13 whether she 'll run for president			1
" well , i am running ... around the park , " @entity13 quipped			0
and when it came to @entity7 , who swore that @entity1 gives the best parties , the 84 - year - old journalist could n't help but inquire about the actor 's relationship with wife @entity29 , which hit a rough patch last summer			1
( these days , @entity7 said , " @entity29 and i are wonderful			1
" ) with that much curiosity still evidently brimming , why is @entity1 leaving ? well , keep in mind that she 's not leaving tv in general			1
she 'll still serve as executive producer of " @entity4 , " and will make special appearances for @entity37 when needed			2
it 's just that , as @entity1 said when she announced her retirement in may 2013 , she has no interest in appearing on another tv program			1
@entity42 : @entity1 is retiring but not going away @entity1 began her national broadcast career in 1961 as a reporter , writer and panel member for @entity48 's " today " show before being promoted to co-host in 1974			1
by 1976 , @entity37 had snatched her up for its own news programs			0
at that network , @entity1 launched " the @entity54 " and " @entity55 " before becoming a co-host and correspondent for @entity37 ' " @entity53 " in 1984			1
along the way , she 's interviewed every @entity58 president and first lady since @entity60 and @entity61			0
looking upon the numerous women who had looked up to her throughout her career , @entity1 said they were her legacy			2
" how do you say goodbye to something like 50 years in television ? " she said in conclusion			0
" how proud when i see all the young women who are making and reporting the news			0
if i did anything to help make that happen , that is my legacy			0
from the bottom of my heart , to all of you with whom i have worked and who have watched and been by my side , i can say : ' thank you			0
' " ironically , one of the best - informed women in news had no idea what to expect for her farewell taping			0
" nobody told me what was going to happen today , so i could n't plan for it , " @entity1 told @entity87 's @entity86 after the taping			2
" nobody told me that @entity6 was going to show up			2
that line of women who said that maybe i inspired or influenced them ? nobody told me about that			0
nobody told me that @entity5 was going to come in ! it was all just a wonderful surprise			1
" still soaking it in , @entity1 reflected , " i have to remember ( all of this ) on days that are not so great			2
i have to remember these women			0
i have to remember today			0
