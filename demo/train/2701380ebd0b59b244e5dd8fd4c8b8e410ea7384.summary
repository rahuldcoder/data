-- the @entity1 might account for less than one tenth of global private jet sales , but the passengers flying on the region 's luxury planes can be the most demanding in the world			1
" yes the people who fly our planes are demanding , and they have a right to be , " says @entity8 , managing director of @entity9			0
" you 're talking about the businessmen who very much invented the rules of the game			0
" capturing the small but significant patronage of the region 's super rich is becoming increasingly competitive as more private jet charter companies tap into a market that is expected to grow by around 12 % in the next two years , according to the @entity22			1
to do that " it 's about offering the full experience , from pre-flight through to well after the plane has landed , " says @entity8			1
" the journey does n't end with the aircraft landing , we have to think ' where should we take him to , to which hotel ? ' " the in - flight experience is just one part of it , although private jet manufactures and companies that fit out jets are continually pushing the limits of what can be done to meet client needs on board			1
later this month @entity43 is set to flight test its first steam shower aboard a @entity47 -- not an easy job given the hazard of creating pressure and heat within the cabin			2
condensation also must not be allowed to form inside or on the plane 's structure			2
the royal treatment for @entity8 's clients who wish to be treated like kings , @entity56 , the @entity57 - based charter company , actually caters for members of the @entity62 's royal family			2
the company is jointly owned by @entity65 and the @entity66 , the royal flight service			0
" it 's like having a fleet of boutique hotels , " says @entity67 , the company 's ceo , from the luxurious confines of one of the firm 's 737 @entity71			2
cultural needs are taken into particular consideration			0
" among @entity80 clients there is a desire for separate areas for men and women and they are very specific where the bedroom may be located , " says @entity67			1
" it 's important that the bedrooms are located near the front of the plane , while for some other markets its ok for them to be located near the back ; so configurations are very important			1
" other business jet manufacturers like @entity97 find their larger models are more popular in the region			0
they attribute the popularity to how many more high net worth individuals in the region travel with extended families , than those from other parts of the world			0
" gray market " together @entity109 and the @entity57 account for around 70 % of the private jet market in the @entity1 and @entity111 , according to @entity22 , but there are some clouds on the horizon for the charter companies			1
one of the biggest problems they face in the region is the " gray market " -- planes owned by private individuals who then rent them out without having to go through the same regulatory scrutiny ( or expense ) of the charter companies			1
" it 's like having unlicensed taxi cabs , " says @entity67			2
" there is a network or brokers out there who cater for this and it actually undercuts the legitimate businesses			0
" " we like competition but we like competition that is fair and legal			0
it 's a very expensive business to be in , the margins are razor thin , and we 'd prefer it to be an industry of well - funded organizations experienced in aviation rather than aviation enthusiasts -- the owner - operator syndrome			1
" this is one of the reasons companies like @entity56 and @entity9 are keen to highlight the safety and security of their planes and the experience of their pilots , as well as the level of service			0
efforts are being made to close the loops in the system , according to @entity8 , " and ultimately it will be [ fixed ] , like in any maturing market			0
" until then private jet charter companies will continue to provide luxury services and play the necessary " game " in order to secure the loyalty of clients			1
" the price has to be right and the product has to be right , " says @entity8 .			0
