no other instrument or object in @entity3 society is more vilified and maligned -- or evokes more emotion and passionate debate -- than the firearm			1
any category of death by unnatural causes should get attention			0
however , when that death occurs as the result of a gun being illegally used , reason and logic are marginalized , myths become facts and emotion drives the conversation			2
the problem with the gun in @entity3 is that the left has politicized it			1
an entire advocacy has been developed and is part of their political platform			0
their call for gun control is deceptively wrapped around a theme of reducing street violence and mass killings			2
the flaw in their argument is that none of the remedies they offer to reduce these senseless acts has anything to do with why this violence occurs			2
for the anti-gun cabal , this is more about defeating a political adversary , the influential @entity46 , than it is about reducing gun violence			1
@entity49 background checks and limiting magazine capacity are offered as reasonable approaches to reducing violence			2
neither of these suggestions is directly associated with gun violence			1
instead , these technical fixes frustrate the overwhelming number of law - abiding @entity3 gun owners			1
our system of jurisprudence is predicated on punishing those individuals directly involved in committing crime , not those who are not			2
gun control has never worked to eradicate violence			2
the cities of @entity68 and @entity69 have had some of the strictest gun laws in @entity3 , yet they continue to experience high levels of gun - related , violent crime			1
a little - talked - about truth is that gun control in @entity3 has its roots in racism			1
its original intent was to keep firearms out of the hands of black people , more specifically , newly - freed slaves			0
as @entity84 noted in his article " @entity86 , " civil rights champion @entity83 said this about the value of bearing arms , " ... the only case where the proposed lynching ( of a @entity92 ) did not occur was where the men armed themselves			0
" she went on to say that the " lesson that teaches , and which every @entity96 should ponder well , is that a @entity98 rifle should have a place of honor in every black home and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give			0
" in a recent @entity106 article , @entity104 quoted civil rights champion @entity83 on the value of bearing arms : " ' ... the only times an @entity96 who was assaulted got away has been when he had a gun and used it in self - defense			2
' " and , quoting her further : " ' ... a @entity98 rifle should have a place of honor in every black home , and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give			0
' " @entity117 @entity116 also supported the right of blacks to arm themselves to guard against mob violence			0
as noted in @entity124 's book , " @entity122 : the evolution of a @entity129 , " @entity116 believed that " slaves without arms " could never attain freedom			0
even the @entity130 at the time recognized the key role that arming blacks played in the ending of slavery			0
in 2010 , the @entity3 @entity136 granted @entity137 , a @entity68 resident , that same protection by validating his right to keep and bear arms when they struck down the city 's unreasonable gun control ordinance			1
@entity143 sued @entity68 , claiming that the restriction prevented him from protecting himself and his home from gang violence			0
preventing private citizens the right to arm themselves for their own defense is a @entity151 death sentence			0
here are more effective ways to reduce gun violence : first , let 's rid ourselves of the fantasy that strict gun control is even achievable			1
in his blog for the @entity161 , @entity159 law professor @entity158 said that " such a conversation about gun violence should be tempered by constitutional , political and practical realities			1
we are not about to ban the private ownership of guns in the @entity3			1
" second , end social engineering experiments in the criminal justice system that see criminal perpetrators in a warped view as victims of society to be treated leniently			1
punishment , when applied early in a criminal 's career , is an effective deterrent to crime			0
finally , stop conditioning society that guns are evil			1
they save many more lives than they take			0
instead , start providing gun safety education that teaches people to respect firearms , not fear them .			0

the @entity186 *explores* the role of guns in the @entity3
@entity190 says many gun restrictions are **n't** directly associated with gun violence
we should **n't** view criminals as victims who need to be treated leniently , he says
we also need to stop conditioning society that guns are evil , @entity190 says
