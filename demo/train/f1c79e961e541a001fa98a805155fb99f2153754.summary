@entity0 , @entity1 -- someone must be held responsible for a " shambolic " response to a water crisis that has left thousands without running water , one of @entity1 's top politicians said thursday			1
speaking after an emergency meeting of power - sharing ministers in @entity0 , first minister @entity9 said the government water company 's efforts to restore water supplies to tens of thousands of homes was " shambolic " and " ineffective			1
" he said a review would now be carried out by ministers and hinted at action against @entity21 's top executives			1
" people must assess their own position , and of course if people do n't assess their own position the review will look at where responsibility lies and decisions will be taken on the foot of that , " said @entity9			0
deputy first minister @entity32 was also highly critical of the response , calling it " totally unacceptable behaviour by an arm 's - length body "			0
" we are not prepared to accept this treatment on behalf of citizens , " he said			0
" ... under no circumstances are we going to stand here and make excuses for a body that has failed so miserably			1
" @entity21 said thursday it could be early next week before all customers are reconnected			1
up to 60,000 homes and businesses are experiencing water disruption , the company said in a written statement thursday			1
of those , 6,000 have lacked running water since monday			1
however , on tuesday some residents reported they had not had water for nine days			2
" the numbers on a curtailed supply will vary from between 3,500 to 60,000 at any given time , " the statement said			2
" @entity59 will continue to rotate supplies so figures will increase and decrease as this process is continued in order to protect reservoir levels			0
" @entity21 has said the " unprecedented problems " were caused by a rapid thaw , with a huge number of pipes bursting after a dramatic change in temperature -- from minus - 16 to 10 degrees @entity70 ( 3 to 50 degrees @entity71 ) " within a matter of hours			1
" @entity75 officials have also complained about a lack of investment in the water infrastructure over the years			1
the company said it had increased the supply of water to its highest level ever -- from 600 million liters per day to 850 million liters per day ( 158 million gallons to 224 million gallons )			1
" this increase in demand is to a great degree as a result of leakage from bursts on private properties , " the statement said			0
doctors are warning of an increasing public health risk if the water shortages continue			2
two hospitals have experienced supply problems			0
emergency supplies were being made available at locations across the province , including recreation centers where those without running water were being offered free showers			1
the @entity104 government has sent 160,000 liters ( 42,000 gallons ) of bottled water to @entity1 after supplies ran out			2
ahead of the meeting of ministers on thursday , @entity108 deputy leader @entity107 described the situation as " @entity112 and horrendous			0
" he added : " if the executive at @entity116 ( the @entity0 government ) is n't able to deal with this , the @entity114 government will have to take over -- that 's how bad things are			0
" in the @entity121 , hundreds of thousands had supplies cut off or restricted , again as a result of burst pipes after the thaw			0
repair crews worked to fix leaks , and mobile water supplies were being sent to the worst - hit areas			0
the @entity121 government said thursday night most parts of the country would see a resumption of normal water supply within the next two days , but in the capital , @entity137 , restrictions were expected to remain in place until january 10			2
@entity121 @entity140 @entity139 said significant progress was being made across the country to deal with water leaks and stoppages			0
it was also announced restrictions on water supplies were to be eased in most areas friday night to facilitate @entity150 celebrations .			0
