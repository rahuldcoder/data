@entity0 , @entity1 -- even surrounded by hundreds of her flamboyant outfits , @entity3 cuts an attention - grabbing figure			1
presenting a world of fashion to @entity8 , @entity3 was happiest to talk about practically anything else			2
in @entity0 for the opening of a traveling retrospective of her work , she arrived at the exhibition , her characteristic red hair contrasting with her pale complexion , with a small entourage of suitably fashionable and vaguely mysterious looking characters in tow			1
as she folded herself into a chair for the @entity23 interview , the entourage settled in the background -- some blending in with the grand designs of the exhibition , others , like @entity28 , a small , bald man wearing dark glasses , providing more of a contrast			1
things did n't begin as well as they could have			2
wearing a splendid pair of high heels and a black wrap dress with cuts and slashes entwined with what looked to an untutored eye to be medical bandages , @entity3 found the large , soft - looking armchair too hard and uncomfortable			0
it was duly swapped for a small plastic chair that looked hard and uncomfortable , but was more to her liking , taking to it like a fakir to a bed of nails			0
more comfortable then but not quite settled , the first question was greeted by a long pause and then a moment of mild panic for the production crew as she shut her eyes and put her head in her hands			0
but it was n't the question apparently , it was the too - cold and too - noisy air conditioning that was n't right			0
" i 'm very sensitive to noise , " she said in her @entity59 accent , before apologizing for having to change things about before she could start properly			0
" i 'm alright when i get going , " she said with a reassuring smile			0
softly spoken , many answers were peppered with pauses , hmms and rhetorical " what am i trying says , " which often made it seem as if she 'd never been asked some of the questions before			0
more likely was that she was trying to approach them in a new way , making a different cut from an old pattern			0
" i 've got a terrible memory ; it 's probably because i 'm always concentrating on what i 'm doing now , " she said in some way to explain her individual interview style , but probably revealed as much about how she 's managed to be so consistently imaginative and inventive over the years			1
@entity28 from the entourage was eventually banished from her eyeline after one too many smirks and giggles at the mention of her former husband and partner in punk , @entity87			0
she warmed most to the interview when she had the opportunity to express her views on everything apart from fashion , from how lucky the @entity93 are to have prince @entity94 to the state of the media : " it 's all boring			1
journalists are usually quite jealous people , especially of intellectuals who are supposed to be in fashion			1
" at one point a few " anyways " and " what am i trying to says " led on to an enthusiastic extolling of a particular @entity1 painting as the high point of human existence before things went on to how art has n't moved on since 17th century @entity108 paintings and how young people today do n't have any imagination			2
as for her relationship with her partner @entity114 , who was n't part of the day 's entourage : " he could n't stand it if i was talking like this at home now , he 'd be off in the kitchen or doing something else			1
but he 's the most stimulating person i know			2
" while she was happy to talk about individual pieces of clothing at the exhibition , she was generally more content to pontificate than talk about punk , proving that in herself she was truer to the ethos of the term than the fashion style she helped popularize .			1
