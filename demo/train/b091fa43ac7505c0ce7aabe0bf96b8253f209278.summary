-- on tuesday afternoon , president @entity1 will meet with @entity3 leaders for the first time since the midterm election			1
the @entity7 meeting had been dubbed the " @entity12 , " but it 's going to take something stronger than a flavored ice shake to cut through the deep distrust that 's accumulated between these two parties			1
the kool - aid that gets passed around @entity14 most often these days is the belief that our political opponents are sworn enemies			2
it is an idea compounded by partisan media that demonizes even minor disagreements			2
but it was n't always this way			1
in the past , @entity23 and @entity24 could disagree on policies throughout the day , then meet together for a drink or dinner			1
their children went to school together			2
their families saw each other on the weekends or at worship services			2
but now congressmen fly home from @entity14 as often as possible			2
there is very little time for across - the - aisle socializing and much more time for accusing opponents of being socialist			2
our political leaders do n't get to know each other as people			1
that 's where the cigarette comes in			1
it 's a strange fact that @entity1 and speaker - elect @entity47 have been known to smoke , while the majority of @entity50 have given up this once common vice			1
it is a streak of illogic and self - destructiveness in otherwise disciplined and ambitious men who have climbed to the top of their field without wheezing			2
so if @entity47 and @entity1 are both going to be tempted to sneak out for a smoke at some point during their bipartisan summit , here 's a suggestion : do it together			1
have an honest off - the - record conversation and get to know each other as individuals			2
these two men come from very different backgrounds			2
@entity47 was one of a dozen children whose father ran a bar in @entity73 ; @entity1 was raised by a single mother in @entity75 after his father returned to @entity77			1
but they are both examples of the @entity50 dream , and they both love their country			2
sharing a smoke is an opportunity to acknowledge that they 're both hugely accomplished but still flawed individuals			0
it 's an opportunity to admit that , yes , they have serious philosophical differences but that , for the good of the country , they need to find a way to work together , and that begins with a conversation			1
unguarded , off - the - record socializing was an important reason the closely divided @entity97 of the 1950s worked so effectively			0
then majority leader @entity99 smoked and drank and played cards with his @entity3 counterparts			1
of course , he was then considered a conservative southern @entity102 , and that made it easier to reach across the aisle during the @entity107 administration			0
the decline of both progressive @entity24 and conservative @entity23 has made the partisan gulf wider			0
but even in the epic philosophic fights that accompanied the @entity113 era and the @entity115 administration , house speaker @entity110 would famously have a drink with president @entity117 or president @entity115 after a long day of principled differences and parliamentary maneuvers			1
it was a recognition of a forgotten @entity50 wisdom - that our political opponents are not our enemies			0
in contrast , let 's cite just one small recent example of how far we 've fallen			0
on monday , @entity128 rep. @entity128 created a @entity130 presentation , first reported by the @entity131 , in his bid to secure the chairmanship of the @entity134			0
it compared @entity3 congressional leaders to @entity107 , general @entity137 , and general @entity138 in " battle against the @entity1 administration			1
" the only problem here is that this would , by implication , make the president and his @entity23 allies the @entity149 @entity148 army			1
this is unhelpful in creating a tone of mutual respect and constructive engagement			0
but we seem to be getting desensitized to such loaded comparisons			0
once @entity1 and @entity47 get past the interpersonal niceties , there is some common ground substance to discuss			1
friendly recognition of @entity1 's decision to announce a two - year pay freeze for all federal workers would be a step in the right direction			1
it was a policy proposal advanced by many republicans in recent months			0
it should be treated as the beginning of some good faith bargaining going forward			0
likewise , there might be some compromise on extending the tax cuts for households that make less than $ 1 million a year			0
on the deficit and debt front , @entity1 and @entity47 could agree to back the bipartisan deficit reduction panel if it comes back with proposals			1
the deep distrust and persuasive hyper - partisanship that has suffused our political debates makes that kind of common ground conversation almost impossible			1
but the time for campaigning has ended			0
the time for governing has begun again			0
sharing a smoke -- however unwise or un-pc that might sound -- or a drink or a meal every once in a while is just one way to jumpstart a relationship			0
in a democracy , government can not be a warfare of interests			0
it depends on people in our government honoring principled disagreements but always keeping in mind that what unites us as @entity50 is more important than what divides us			0
the responsibility of leadership is to repair some of the broken trust in @entity50 institutions			0
that effort must extend beyond photo - op bipartisanship			0
it must be built on the foundation of honest conversation and getting to know each other as people rather than partisan caricatures with cloven hooves and horns			0
a cigarette summit is n't a one - step solution , it 's just the start of a conversation			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

president @entity1 and new @entity3 congressional leaders meet this week
they *'ll* meet as bitter *rivals* ; such meetings were n't always this way , @entity227 says
politicians once could disagree by day , *negotiate* over friendly dinners by night , @entity227 says
@entity227 : @entity1 , @entity47 should sit down with a cigarette and find common ground
