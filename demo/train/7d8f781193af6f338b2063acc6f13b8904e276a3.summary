-- business leaders , heads of government , entrepreneurs and even the odd celebrity will be rubbing fur and down - quilted shoulders at @entity8 's highest altitude town , @entity9 , for the @entity11 's annual meeting this week			1
the high - powered talk-fest , founded by @entity14 economist @entity13 in 1971 , has become a vital part of the business calendar -- for the intensity of its networking as much as declarations of action from the speakers ' podiums			1
@entity11 describes itself as " an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging political , academic and other leaders of society to shape global , regional and industry agendas			1
" as is traditional , the theme of its annual meeting in @entity9 is sweeping and , at first glance , somewhat opaque : " the @entity33 : @entity34 , politics and @entity36			1
" the @entity11 says the theme " reflects on the disruptions that societies face on a global scale driven by rapid technological and scientific innovation , accelerating social change and a shifting global economic order			1
" according to @entity0 's @entity44 , the @entity11 may have a point with its choice of theme			1
the world has changed , @entity49 says , after its emergence from the wreckage of five years of crisis			2
in its wake , there is " a landscape where old rules no longer exist and the new ones have yet to be written and agreed			2
" " the issues are prescient , they are on everyone 's mind , we all know that ' times are different ' and we are by no means sure how to handle them , " @entity49 says			2
but he ponders whether those at @entity9 will be able to unite to plot a way forward in this new landscape			2
if it 's a question of numbers , they 've certainly got a head start			2
the 44th annual meeting is bringing together more than 2,500 leaders , thinkers and public figures representing more than 100 countries			1
it is strictly invitation only			2
certain groups -- heads of state , faith leaders , academics , social entrepreneurs , members of international organizations and news anchors -- can attend free of charge , but for businesses , the cost of a ticket is approximately $ 20,000			1
for that fee , from january 22 to 25 participants will be able to attend more than 250 sessions and workshops based around the overarching " reshaping " theme			2
guest speakers range from the @entity100 president @entity99 , @entity102 head @entity101 , @entity104 general secretary @entity103 and @entity106 founder @entity105 to actors @entity108 and @entity109			1
the forum is taking place against a backdrop of violent conflict in @entity114 , the @entity115 and @entity116			2
@entity116 opposition leader @entity117 will be at the @entity9 gathering , with a second round of peace talks being held in another corner of @entity122 -- on the shores of @entity124 -- the same week			2
bloodshed in the @entity125 and @entity126 has disrupted the region 's economies , with the @entity130 's latest report saying they remained depressed after the @entity131 that began in @entity132 three years ago and sparked @entity116 's civil war			0
" political turmoil in @entity136 , stalemate in @entity132 and an escalation of the civil war in @entity116 with spillovers to neighboring @entity141 and @entity142 have weakened activity in the developing oil - importing countries , " the report said			1
in @entity146 , there has also been a fall in production but the @entity130 points to international sanctions as the reason			0
however , that may change after last year 's historic deal between world powers on an interim deal with @entity146 that imposes limits on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief			0
@entity146 's president @entity159 -- who replaced the country 's controversial previous president , @entity160 , last year -- will be at @entity9 and is due to speak on the subject of " @entity146 in the @entity163			0
" also walking the @entity11 corridors will be @entity166 prime minister @entity165 , who has described @entity159 as " a wolf in sheep 's clothing			1
" he is scheduled to speak on " @entity166 's @entity170			0
" president @entity171 will speak on " celebrating the ' @entity172 ' " -- which will perhaps explain why the traditional enemies are going to the same talk-fest party			1
participants will have some reason to celebrate , as the global economy has shown signs of improvement since last year 's meeting			1
@entity183 , often the focus for economic hope , has pushed through bold policies under its new leadership			0
the country 's 300 - plus political elite have reportedly agreed to curb government meddling in the economy and make state - owned enterprises compete with the private sector on a level playing field			1
@entity9 sessions include one on @entity183 's outlook and another on how @entity183 , @entity8 and the @entity195 can compete and collaborate			0
meanwhile , in @entity198 , prime minister @entity197 's bold measures to jump - start his country 's economy -- dubbed " @entity201 " -- has had an impact , with an initial jump in growth before the economy weakened			1
he is a speaker at the forum , under the topic " the @entity33 : vision from @entity198			0
" @entity8 , whose ailing economic health has dominated discussions at the last two year 's events , appears to be off its sickbed			0
last year the eurozone returned to growth for the first time since 2011 but the difference for ordinary citizens may be negligible , and austerity measures are still in place			0
youth unemployment in @entity222 and @entity223 is above 50 % , while rates in @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 are all above 30 %			0
as for the @entity195 , much of 2013 's focus was on the debt ceiling and october 's government shut - down			1
government dysfunction passed the economy as @entity195 ' top concern in @entity235 's polling late last year			0
@entity195 secretary of state @entity236 will attend @entity9 and deliver remarks on " the @entity195 ' commitment to and engagement in the @entity125 region , " according to the @entity241			0
@entity236 has been working to achieve a peace deal between the @entity166 and @entity243 but recently the @entity195 has faced diplomatic hurdles closer to home			0
a top concern of @entity195 's traditional allies may well be the @entity249 's surveillance program , details of which were revealed in documents leaked by @entity253 last year			0
@entity14 chancellor @entity254 , allegedly among those targeted , is a frequent @entity9 attendee but will not be present this year			0
this is not , a spokesman said , because of her skiing accident -- she fractured her pelvis on recent visit to @entity122 -- but because the event coincides with a government meeting			1
while those attending @entity9 may not be focusing on their winter sports activities , it is on the side - lines of the main program that some of them may go " off - piste			1
" the raclette , gluhwein and hot chocolate chats could be the ones where deals are brokered			0
