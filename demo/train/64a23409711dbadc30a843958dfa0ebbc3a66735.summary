will @entity1 's forthcoming @entity0 breathe new life into its aging @entity0 concept ? hard to say at this point , but it will bring a fresh element to @entity1 gaming			1
i got my hands on the redesigned system , which was first previewed a year ago , after @entity1 's @entity12 event in @entity13 on tuesday			1
here are my first impressions : first , the @entity15			0
it is smaller than a tablet , but larger than your mobile phone			0
it does n't feel heavy in the hands , and you will really have to try hard to snap it in two ( not recommended )			0
the @entity15 is part controller and part handheld console , and new games are expected to take advantage of both abilities			0
i tried out the @entity0 on two games , each featuring a different use for the device			1
" @entity36 's @entity35 " takes advantage of what @entity1 calls asymmetric gameplay			1
this allows the @entity0 to have unique goals and abilities in the game when played simultaneously with other people holding regular @entity0 controllers			1
in this game , the player with the @entity0 is a ghost trying to track down and capture the four players using @entity0 controllers			2
the ghost player uses the @entity0 built - in screen to see everything on the map while the four other players must watch the tv screen to capture a ghost they ca n't usually see			1
the @entity0 screen is large enough to make small shapes easy enough to distinguish			2
the two joystick controllers feel natural and sturdy , and comparable to other console joysticks			0
there are also two sets of shoulder buttons which are appropriately placed and do n't feel uncomfortable to use			0
in the second game , " @entity68 's @entity67 , " those buttons are used to manipulate a course you navigate by tilting the @entity0 in the appropriate directions			1
the shoulder buttons raise and lower bridges and elevators while the joysticks are used to turn cranks			0
it was a little difficult to rotate joysticks while also trying to tilt the @entity0 u. but with practice , i was able to get the right amount of touch without dying			2
players can watch the overall action on their tvs or get an up - close view through the @entity0 screen			2
i ca n't envision players using the big screen for games when the small one is in their hands			0
@entity1 plans to release a wide range of games , from kid titles like " @entity93 " to offerings for hardcore gamers like " @entity96 " and " @entity97			2
" the promise of additional gameplay features for the @entity0 make it an intriguing option			0
overall , the @entity0 is a solid hybrid of a souped - up @entity102 system and a handheld gaming device			1
it 's larger than a traditional console controller , but not so heavy that it would cause fatigue problems			0
despite no announcement of a specific launch date or a price , the @entity0 will only be as good as the games made for it			1
@entity1 's focus on games during tuesday 's event is a sign the gaming company may have its eye on the right target .			1

the @entity0 will bring a fresh new element to @entity1 gaming
@entity1 still has n't announced a specific launch date or a price for the system
