-- they called him " @entity3			2
" @entity4 had a bong named @entity6			1
there 's a photo of him in his new memoir , " @entity11 , " high on mushrooms			1
another photo shows him drunk			2
he was a one - man party			2
in one scene in the book , he is carried out of his @entity18 dormitory because his loud merrymaking disturbed his roommate			1
( or maybe he was carried into his dormitory			2
) at his @entity23 high school , he spent three years " drunk and stoned			1
" or so he claims			2
but mostly he says he struggled to fit in			1
throughout his life , well before college or high school , he confesses to feeling lonely , or angry , or anxious			1
could this really be @entity4 ? the laugh - out - loud author of " @entity29 " and " @entity30 " ? the @entity4 who can find absurdist comedy in overseas revolutions , economic collapse and small electric appliances ? that @entity4 ? one and the same , says the author in a phone interview from a tour stop in @entity38			1
" the truth of the matter is i was a jerk in many , many ways , " he says			0
' humor is the armor ' let 's be clear : @entity4 did n't rob a bank or maim an old widow			1
he was merely a bright kid who was sometimes out of control			0
still , " @entity11 " is an attempt to revisit his life -- that of the @entity53 @entity52 immigrant who made his way in the @entity55 -- and get at the root of his woe			1
much of it originated at home with loving but wounding parents			1
@entity4 was born in 1972 and spent the first seven years of his life in @entity62 ( now @entity62 ) , in an apartment with a @entity53 tv that was always in danger of exploding			1
his parents , stifled in many ways , bickered			0
when his family moved to the @entity55 , he could n't help but be impressed by the riches of the @entity70			1
" we did n't have to go to a store in order to feel like we were someplace completely and insanely ( different )			0
you land at the international arrivals building -- the @entity78 terminal -- at @entity79 and it 's shaped like a flying saucer			1
it looked like something from the 21st century , " he recalls			0
" you saw a @entity84 and wondered if this was an airplane without wings on the ground			0
" it took time to make the adjustment , he observes , especially since finding his way at school was as difficult as doing so at home			1
it helped that he had a nimble mind			0
in the book , he talks about the stories he wrote , including a rewrite of the @entity99 ; he called it the " @entity101 , " after his adolescent nickname , " @entity103			1
" he details the long stretches of the computer game @entity106 he played with his friend @entity107			0
@entity4 being @entity4 , he ca n't help but make the mundane amusing			1
his family came over with orange suitcases ( and dark jackets ) of " real @entity111 leather			1
" the boy popping a wheelie on the box of @entity116 cereal becomes " an important role model			0
" his family receives a letter from @entity120 , addressed to " mr. @entity122 * tgart , " and believes it has just won $ 10 million -- though , to be sure the judges approve , he and his parents fill out everything and sign up for several magazines			1
even the later stories , about his drunkenness and a disturbed girlfriend , have a comic spin			0
this laughter in the face of sadness comes naturally given his @entity53 - @entity52 heritage , says @entity4			1
" i 'd call it ' laughter from the edge of the grave , ' " he says			0
" yes , it 's quite tragic , but at the same time , if you do n't laugh at it , the other solution is to wrap yourself in a shawl and die			2
humor is the armor and the sword that you are given			0
" ' i tried to write this in the most loving way i could ' he says he had lots of help in putting together " @entity11			1
" he interviewed family and friends , including an old girlfriend who had saved his lengthy letters			2
" i was very grateful she 'd done that , " he says			0
" because , as readers will know , at @entity18 i was n't sober 100 % of the time , ( so ) it was very helpful to discover these letters and reconstruct what had happened			0
" ' @entity11 ' is as entertaining as it 's moving , " wrote @entity166 in the @entity167			1
" ' @entity11 ' ... is a much more straightforwardly soulful account than many of his readers might expect. , " wrote @entity168 in the @entity169			1
@entity4 still has n't heard from his most important reviewers , however : his parents			1
he hopes he did right by them			0
" i tried to write this in the most loving way i could , because i do love them very much			0
they made a lot of sacrifices			0
" but there 's still a language barrier			2
" their @entity184 may not have all the nuances needed to read something like this			0
i 'm usually translated into @entity53 , so i think the ultimate test is to see what they think of a version published in @entity53 , " he says			0
however , he says that another observer , his longtime psychoanalyst , has n't disapproved			0
of course , he has n't approved , either			0
" i 'm such a bad analysand			0
in traditional @entity198 analysis you 're supposed to lie there , and instead i whip out my phone and start typing in the stuff that just came up so i wo n't forget exactly how it happened , " he says			0
" and because it 's traditional analysis , the analyst does n't rebuke me or say anything , so i get away with it			2
" maybe , he adds , the book is a capstone of sorts , and it 's time to move on , anyway			1
he 's already progressed , he says			2
" unlike most @entity212 i only see mine four times a week as opposed to the five times a week that 's traditional			2
so i 'm something of an outlier , " he says			0
" but it 's only been 12 years and we 're ready to stop soon			2
