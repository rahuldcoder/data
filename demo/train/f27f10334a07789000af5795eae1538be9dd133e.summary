of the many shocking and wrenching images that have come from the sinking of the @entity3 ferry , one that stands out for me depicts the vessel 's captain -- head bowed and covered by a hood -- standing on dry land admitting he had abandoned ship			1
he was , in fact , among the first to be rescued			0
the shock for me is not this image itself , but the realization that captain @entity20 - seok must have known as he got off the @entity3 that hundreds of other passengers -- including 325 students -- were still inside , apparently following instructions to stay put -- instructions that may be proven by investigators to have led directly to their deaths			2
on monday , the @entity27 coast guard released new footage of the captain and other crew members leaving the ship -- images that to me are equally disturbing			1
the sea around the @entity3 looks glass - calm			0
it 's bright morning light , there 's no swell , there 's no obvious sign of tearing currents			2
for a body of water with such a treacherous reputation , it looks benign			0
perhaps not safe , but well worth risking if your life is at stake			0
at this point the @entity3 is leaning dangerously , to the port or left side , its upper deck under water			0
no one knows the vessel is close to beginning its final descent to the seabed			0
but captain @entity20 , wearing a shirt and what looks like his underwear , and other crew members are helped into a small rescue boat , leaving the passengers to their fate			1
in cell phone footage taken by a teenage boy inside the @entity3 -- also released in recent days -- students after being told effectively to sit tight are seen patiently waiting for further instructions and for help to arrive			0
a showing of faith and trust in authority that appears now tragically misplaced			0
none of the crew , including the captain , identified themselves to rescuers as crew members , the first coast guard responders said in a press conference on monday			1
their uniforms -- if they were wearing them -- were hidden by life vests			0
this footage has only added to already widespread public revulsion in @entity27 around the events surrounding the sinking of the @entity3			1
a week ago , president @entity89 described the crew 's actions as being " like murder			1
" an aunt of one of the student victims from @entity96 told me how " ashamed " she was that this could happen in @entity27			1
she is so upset , she just wants to leave the country			0
there are tales of heroism as well			0
the 22 - year - old crew member @entity103 who died as she tried to help passengers to safety and handing out life vests			2
and of course there are the divers and rescue teams scouring the sunken vessel in extremely difficult conditions			2
perhaps these acts may not have been necessary if more immediate and appropriate action had been taken by the ship 's commanding officers			1
there 's no international maritime law that says a captain has to go down with his or her ship			1
but there have been honorable examples of this course of action -- captain @entity125 of the @entity126 comes to mind			2
the captain is responsible for the vessel and all the people on board			0
in some countries , including @entity27 , abandoning ship is a maritime crime			1
it 's not just the actions of @entity20 under the microscope here			1
it 's also the shipping company itself and government regulation			0
how were the crew trained to deal with emergencies ? how safe was the vessel ? how well - regulated are @entity27 's coastal passenger ships ? all are questions to which @entity27 are demanding answers			1
yes , the captain and 14 other @entity3 crew members have been arrested amid ongoing investigations			2
they all face charges of " causing death by abandoning ( ship ) , and violation of the country 's marine law , the @entity161 and in the @entity160 , " @entity158 , the senior prosecutor for the investigation task force says			2
at this stage though , it is the actions and the images of the captain that stand out -- at least for me			1
the image of a man who for many , if not legally but certainly at least morally , is responsible for his passengers , seemingly putting himself before everyone else .			0

images of captain 's rescue adds to anger in @entity27 over ferry tragedy
captain 's rescue happened while others were still in the sinking ship
actions of captain and crew are under the microscope
