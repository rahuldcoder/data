-- the @entity3 @entity2 has called on governor @entity4 to publicly denounce an attempt by a @entity7 group to honor a @entity9 leader , the organization said monday			1
the @entity10 has launched the campaign to recognize @entity7 gen. @entity12 on a specialty license plate			1
@entity12 , a popular and controversial figure , is best known as a leader of the @entity9 , the white supremacist group known for terrorizing blacks in the @entity17 after the @entity18			1
he is also praised and criticized for an 1864 raid at @entity20 , @entity21 , where hundreds of black @entity23 members were killed during the war			0
the controversy over whether @entity12 conducted or condoned the massacre is still a matter for heated debate			2
@entity3 @entity2 leaders feel a state - sanctioned license plate honoring a man with ties to the @entity9 sends the wrong message to people in the state and across the country			1
" any individual who was a traitor to our country and our @entity44 should be treated as such , " said @entity37 , president of the state @entity2 chapter			2
@entity12 was a " terrorist " whose acts were " immoral and unconstitutional , " @entity37 said			2
honoring him or anyone who promoted racial hatred or violence would be offensive , he said			0
the @entity2 is n't alone in its protest against the @entity10			1
more than 1,700 @entity3 have joined a @entity51 group called @entity52 @entity12			1
the group 's website says they " are united in sending a message to the state government of @entity3 that we will not stand for the public glorification of one of the original leaders of the @entity9			1
" the proposal by the @entity10 seeks to honor @entity7 generals			1
" if we ca n't hold him up to where he 's supposed to be , then nobody else is gon na do it , " group member @entity63 said			0
@entity12 is being " unfairly maligned , " he told @entity0			2
most historians agree that @entity12 left the @entity9 after less than two years because the small pockets of groups were growing rapidly , were unorganized and violent			1
@entity12 felt " they had the right idea , but went about it the wrong way , " said @entity75 , a part - time political science instructor at @entity77			2
despite his short stint with the @entity9 , @entity75 said @entity12 's affiliation with the organization gave it credibility			1
@entity63 said @entity12 was chosen to be recognized not because of his time with the @entity9 , but for his spirit and leadership during the @entity18			1
his image is one in a series of five that will have to be approved on a year - by - year basis by the state legislature , @entity63 said			0
other @entity7 symbols to be used on license plates are @entity91 , the @entity92 and @entity93 , the battle for @entity94 , the battle of @entity96 and @entity7 soldiers			0
one image still under consideration that may surprise many people is that @entity101 , an @entity102 who fought for the @entity7 and eventually served under president @entity103 as a bear tracker			0
@entity101 is best known for the famous @entity3 hunt where @entity103 refused to shoot a wounded bear			0
it became known as the " @entity109 " craze			0
the @entity10 group has had a specialty license plate since 2003			2
the image of a small @entity7 flag was used until last year when it was redesigned			0
money from the sale of the plates is used to repair state - owned historical flags			0
@entity4 has not responded to the controversy since it began making headlines last week			1
he spoke this weekend at the @entity121 in @entity122 , and is said to be setting his sights on a run for the @entity125 in 2012			0
he finished 15th in a @entity121 straw poll			0
a call to the governor 's office from @entity0 on monday has not been returned .			0
