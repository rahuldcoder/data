the term , near ubiquitous in our app - consuming , fully facebooked world , is one that did n't truly enter the lexicon until the 1990s , when @entity7 took a bow to @entity9 and the palate of professional possibility became wired and well - connected			1
much has changed since then			0
gone are the days when any 20 - something with a computer science degree could dream of a bidding war for their talents , followed by a six - figure salary and free lattes in offices where chair massages and nap rooms are the norm			2
no longer do investors throw millions at anything with dotcom at the end of its name , and many of those early pioneers -- who gambled that we were ready to buy pet supplies or order our groceries from an awkward adolescent called the internet -- are no more			2
but the spirit lives on , in dorm rooms and garages , shared offices and coffee shops with @entity41			0
it 's a fragmented , competitive and constantly changing world			1
but in 2013 , the state of the startup is strong			1
today , @entity45 highlights that world with @entity0 10 : startups			1
our inaugural list looks at 10 emerging companies we think are poised to make a splash in the coming months with new and innovative ideas in fields such as medicine , computing , transportation and video games			1
now more than ever , computing and technology move fast , and the best technology startups are the ones that get in on a trend before it blows up			1
there are a few hot categories on the horizon for consumer technology , including collaborative consumption and the sharing economy , the so - called @entity70 , crowdsourcing , 3 - d printing and the maker movement			1
older institutions like education , finance and health care are also undergoing big changes , with online courses , @entity80 and peer - to - peer lending			2
the biggest venture capital firms in @entity9 are busy putting money into promising startups making their mark in these fields			2
services that tap into the sharing economy are closest to being mainstream			0
ride - sharing service @entity90 , home - rental site @entity92 and labor marketplace @entity94 , are taking off around the world , catching on one city at a time			1
these startups are focused on using resources more efficiently -- filling empty car seats , bedrooms and hours of the day in exchange for money			2
" most people on all of the services are both hosts and users , so it 's a two - way market , which makes this very exciting , " said @entity104 of the @entity105 , a @entity106 venture capital firm			0
" this is for the masses ; it 's not just for rich people who want to use a service			0
" some of the startup world 's cooler emerging gadgets fall under the umbrella of the @entity70			1
smaller sensors mean that everyday objects will soon be collecting data about your life and habits			0
this category already has some big successes , like the nest smart thermostat and wearable fitness devices			1
the field is still young , but it will grow exponentially as more objects get connected			0
" the value of a fax machine is more valuable when another fax machine gets on the network , " said @entity133 of the @entity134			0
" massive opportunities are going to be created			0
" the way we use and interact with our computers is also changing , with devices that use gestures and movement to control what 's on a screen , like the @entity149 wristband and the @entity151 controller			1
" @entity153 is trying to do is make the interface between man and machine disappear , " said @entity104 , whose company is an investor in @entity151			0
in 2013 , though , a successful startup might be one you 'll never hear about			1
@entity159 , of @entity160 , says historically 80 % of venture capital investments are in enterprise technology -- the companies that build the behind - the - scenes technology like networks and storage			2
you do n't hear about these companies as much because they can be technically complicated , but without them the consumer apps , services and gadgets would n't exist			0
for these companies , a happy ending may be when the @entity173 , @entity174 , facebooks and @entity176 of the world come calling , offering a big - dollar buyout			1
but nothing is certain in startups			0
for every @entity182 in a dorm room or pair of @entity185 ( @entity186 and @entity187 ) in a garage , there are many ventures that , despite good ideas and hard work , never take hold			0
and it could be a while before even the best products being developed today show up in a @entity195 or the hottest tech trends have any meaningful impact on the lives of the average consumer			2
" one of the hardest things in technology , " said @entity159 , " is predicting when these things are going to happen			0

in 2013 , the startup world is competitive , fragmented and fast moving
internet - enabled devices , wearable tech are hot trends
motion control and other new ways of interacting with computers also emerging
