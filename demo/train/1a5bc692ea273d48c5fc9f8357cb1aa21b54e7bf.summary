it matters that @entity2 has chosen to make its newest princess @entity4			1
princess @entity5 , who will debut next year on @entity7 's " @entity6 , " according to the company , appears to represent a commitment to diversity -- which also happens to be a smart business strategy in a country with a burgeoning @entity4 population			1
but most importantly , @entity5 -- a princess meant to reflect " diverse @entity15 cultures and folklore , " says @entity2 -- will offer young @entity18 girls an opportunity to see themselves in the media that they consume			1
just like other @entity22 girls			0
and they will see a lot of her : @entity5 will have her own animated series later in 2016 , and will be voiced by the @entity27 - born actress @entity26 , according to a @entity2 press release			1
in other words : move over @entity31 , there is a new princesa in town			0
from @entity35 to @entity36 , the @entity2 princesses are a staple of pop culture -- fantasy heroines iconic to generations of young girls			2
@entity2 has introduced with great fanfare ethnically diverse princesses before : the @entity45 princess ( @entity46 ) , a @entity48 - @entity22 princess ( @entity49 ) , a @entity51 princess ( @entity50 ) , and an @entity53 - @entity22 princess ( @entity52 )			1
and they are no longer primarily known for their ethnicity			0
they are simply seen as @entity2 princesses the same will likely be true of @entity5			2
what 's crucial , is that all young @entity2 fans can feel included , visible , and relevant through a multicultural lineup of heroines			1
by seeing themselves throughout our culture , the next generation of @entity63 will feel more fully part of @entity22 society			1
besides , it could n't hurt for young @entity63 have a positive role model , even if she is a fictional character			0
a 2012 study by the @entity73 found that tv shows and films often contributed to the public 's negative perception of @entity63			0
in fact , the @entity73 found that the top three ways that non-latinos viewed @entity63 in the media were as criminals , gardeners and maids			0
@entity5 also reflects an important recognition by @entity2 of the power of the @entity4 consumer market			1
last year , the @entity88 estimated that @entity22 @entity4 have a spending power of $ 1.4 trillion , and companies like @entity91 , @entity92 , and @entity93 have all targeted @entity4 customers			2
@entity2 already markets a line of quince√±era dresses , so @entity5 could be seen as a logical extension of their brand			2
it can not be lost on @entity2 that its rival @entity100 has enjoyed phenomenal tv and merchandising success with their @entity18 character @entity104			2
sure , some critics have expressed reservations about @entity5 , noting that she is not getting her own movie like the other princesses , and that she is on @entity7 channel , not the more popular @entity110			0
and @entity2 generated controversy when it debuted " @entity6 " in 2013			0
@entity6 was initially reported to be the first @entity18 princess , and then the company walked back on comments by a producer and declared that @entity6 was not @entity18 after all			1
but i think @entity2 should be applauded for trying again			0
the enormous reach of the company will ensure that millions of viewers are exposed to an uplifting @entity18 character			0
consider @entity5 's series will be rolled out in 25 languages on @entity7 channels , in 154 countries around the world			0
that 's a lot of tiaras			0
it is welcome news that @entity2 is finally introducing a princess that looks like thousands of little @entity4 girls			1
here 's hoping that someday @entity5 will be seen not just as a @entity18 princess , but as a character as @entity22 as @entity134 .			1

@entity136 : @entity2 announced new @entity18 princess , which is laudable , likely *profitable* in @entity22 with growing @entity4 population
he says multicultural heroines , like @entity5 , let @entity2 fans , like @entity18 girls , feel more fully part of @entity22 society
