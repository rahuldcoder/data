@entity0 -- from inside a small thatched roof cottage , @entity2 watched with horror as a laundry van approaching the main house of @entity7 exploded with teams of police officers			1
he and other anti-apartheid activists hiding out at the farm attempted to jump out of a back window			1
but they were surrounded , their hopes dashed and their plans for an overthrow of @entity19 's apartheid government were extinguished			1
" the vehicles pulled up that way , and there was nothing i could do , " says @entity2 , recalling july 11 , 1963 , from the same cottage he once called home			1
@entity2 and close friend @entity26 have returned to @entity7 , which has now been turned in to a museum to commemorate 50 years since that fateful day			1
earlier , @entity28 had also used @entity7 as a hideout , posing as a domestic worker			1
but at the time of the raid he was already serving a prison sentence			1
@entity28 had been charged with inciting workers to strike and also leaving the country illegally			1
he had been to the @entity36 and more than a dozen @entity38 countries trying to shore up financial and material support for the @entity41 's armed wing , named @entity42 or " @entity42 , " which means the tip of the spear			0
@entity42 was supposed to execute " @entity50 " a form of guerrilla warfare against the government , taking care not to target civilians			0
the plan was being discussed just before the police raid			0
" i tried to flush as many documents as i could down the toilet but it was too late , " recounts @entity26 , who was in the main house at the time			0

their hatred was palpable , " @entity26 tells @entity1 , remembering the disdain officials had for them			0
police would use evidence found at @entity70 , which included a journal of @entity28 's travels , to charge him and 19 people found at the farm with sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government			2
but the @entity79 trial , as it would become known , would be used as a tool by these activists to show the world what their aim really was			1
@entity26 tells @entity1 , " we would show that the apartheid state was inherently based on violence to maintain itself in power and had to be overturned in the name of humanity and democracy			0
" indeed , @entity28 knew the power of speech from within the courts and knew there was international media interest in the trial , so he too wanted to show their driving philosophy			1
in his autobiography , " @entity101 , " @entity28 writes : " right from the start we had made it clear that we intended to use the trial not as a test of the law but as a platform for our beliefs			1
" read more : where to trace @entity28 's most significant moments he famously said from the dock , " i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities			2
it is an ideal which i hope to live for and to achieve			0
but if needs be , it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die			0
" @entity28 , @entity2 , @entity26 and five others would receive life sentences			2
@entity26 would serve 22 years in prison , @entity2 would serve 26 years as the apartheid government became more isolated and weakened economically			0
@entity28 would be released in 1990 and , in 1994 , become the nation 's first democratically elected president			2
but on the 50th anniversary of a milestone in the struggle against apartheid , @entity26 worries that already @entity19 are forgetting their sacrifices			2
" that 's why i keep saying about @entity28 , it was a whole movement			0
he was a brilliant leader , but it was a whole movement you know			0
and we forget about people and we should n't			0

@entity7 is *located* in the @entity0 *suburb* of @entity79 , @entity19 .
it was bought as a *safehouse* for anti-apartheid activists in the 1960s and is now a museum .
@entity28 was among those who spent time there , pretending to be a worker .
a july 11 , 1963 , raid led to *20* activists being arrested . they used their trial as a *political* tool .
