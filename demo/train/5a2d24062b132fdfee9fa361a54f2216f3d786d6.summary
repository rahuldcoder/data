@entity0 , @entity1 -- i wonder if black people would be still in the fields picking cotton today if the 13th amendment -- the one abolishing slavery -- was placed on the ballot back in 1865			0
i wonder if @entity10 would be at home baking cookies instead of serving as secretary of state if women 's suffrage was put to a vote back in 1919			2
in other words , i wonder just how far along we would be as a society if the oppressive majority held all of the legislative and judicial power over the oppressed minority , essentially yanking the teeth out of @entity24 and the @entity25			2
i 'm sure you 've heard a lot about the gay agenda , but may not know what 's in it			2
here 's what you do : download a copy of the @entity34 , read it			0
everything the @entity37 community wants is in there			0
sounds like an oversimplification ? it 's not			0
@entity42 : what you do n't know about marriage there 's not a single issue regarding the @entity37 community that has been covered in the media or deliberated in courts that is counter to the articles of the @entity51			1
on the other hand , the fact that in 29 states it is legal to fire someone just because they 're gay flies in the face of the 14th amendment , particularly the passage that says " no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the @entity67			1
" that may not be consistent with one 's religion , and that 's fine			0
but the @entity72 and the @entity51 are not the same thing			2
i ca n't think of a single major civil rights victory that came by way of a general election and so i am not surprised that all 32 states that have voted on marriage equality , voted against marriage equality			1
it is human nature to resist change , especially change that may bring significant inconvenience to the vast majority of the people , those who are enjoying the spoils of the status quo			0
" if it 's not broke , do n't fix it , " was never said by the community that was demanding their rights			1
@entity42 : will our kids be a different species ? it was always the mantra of those who liked their slaves ; who liked their women barefoot and pregnant ; who felt uncomfortable working next to someone with cerebral palsy ; who get squeamish at the thought of two men falling in love			0
we elect members of @entity24 to lead us , not appease us			1
this is why our history has so many civil rights victories come by way of @entity24 or the courts and so few if any civil rights victories by election			1
when it gets right down to it , culturally we 're like children who have to be forced to eat our vegetables			0
we like the @entity51 when it can be used to endorse life the way we think it ought to be and we ignore it , or vote against it when the @entity125 or the various amendments challenge our world view or force us to make accommodations -- however big or small -- for others			1
this week election officials in the state of @entity132 announced that a referendum seeking to nullify the recently passed law legalizing same - sex marriage has qualified for the november ballot			0
@entity132 joins @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 as the next round of states that will put the civil rights of some of their citizens to a vote			1
early polls indicate that at least one of them will indeed vote in favor of marriage equality , which is a victory for the 14th amendment of the @entity51			1
though it 's a bit of a shame that the @entity51 needs such victories and that history has taught us nothing			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160			0

@entity160 says everything the gay community wants is in the @entity51
civil rights for @entity167 did n't come through **popular** vote , he says
@entity24 and the courts took the lead and **popular** opinion eventually moved , he says
@entity160 : in 29 states , it 's still legal to fire someone because he or she is gay
