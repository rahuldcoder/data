for the first time since the 2008 presidential race , @entity0 made a foray back into the thorny world of campaign politics on saturday , appearing at a rally for @entity7 , the longtime @entity8 confidante now running for governor of @entity10			1
about 500 people showed up to the historic @entity12 in @entity13 , a suburb of @entity14 to witness @entity8 's smiling re-emergence on the political scene , showering her with applause when she made even the slightest allusion to running for office again			1
what did we learn about her future plans as she considers a repeat bid for the @entity25 in 2016 ? not much at all , actually			2
but here are three important takeaways from @entity8 's first big political speech since leaving the @entity29 earlier this year : she was relaxed never a dynamic speaker on the stump in 2008 , @entity8 was instead relaxed , confident and authoritative on saturday			1
it 's not hard to see why			1
this was a supremely low - risk event for @entity8 -- as perfect a re-entry into national politics as she could have asked for			0
barring some kind of wacky collapse in the final three weeks of the race , @entity7 is generally expected to defeat his @entity43 opponent @entity42 , though some @entity45 here expect the winning margin to be a few points smaller than the eight - point lead he holds in the polls , given the usual @entity43 turnout edge in an off - year			1
the former secretary of state has a close personal friendship with @entity7 , a longtime fundraiser , poker buddy , cheerleader , political fixer and all - purpose confidant for the @entity59			1
the event 's frame -- it was billed as a " @entity63 " rally -- was right in @entity8 's strike zone , giving her a chance to talk about politics in terms she feels most comfortable			2
" the whole country is watching to see if the rights of women and girls will be respected , especially over our own bodies and our health care , " she said of the @entity10 race , alluding to @entity42 's efforts as a state legislator and attorney general to curb access to abortion			1
add it all up , and @entity8 was completely at ease on saturday , campaigning in front a fawning audience in the @entity14 suburbs , talking about women 's issues and propping up one of her longtime pals			2
" i thought hard about what i wanted to say to @entity92 today , " she said			0
" i 've been out of politics for a few years now			0
and i 've had a chance to think a lot about what makes our country so great			0
what kind of leadership is required to keep it great			0
" how long can @entity0 wait ? she was n't afraid to jab @entity43 , however gently @entity8 stayed mostly positive , but she did n't shy away from taking a few shots at @entity103 , albeit not by name			1
talking about the political gridlock on @entity106 that led to a 16 - day government shutdown this month , she said that " we have seen examples of the wrong kind of leadership " in recent days , an unmistakable poke at @entity103			0
" politicians choose scorched - earth over common ground , " she continued			0
" they operate in what i called the evidence - free - zone , with ideology trumping everything else , " she said , before listing the consequences of the shutdown , such as furloughed workers and " children thrown out of @entity125			0
" @entity8 also made sure to highlight @entity43 efforts to enforce stricter abortion regulations in @entity10			1
@entity7 , she said , would " stand up against attempts to restrict women 's health choices			2
" rounding out her speech , @entity8 alluded to @entity133 , the @entity134 writer who described @entity135 as having " habits of the heart " when he traveled to the @entity135 nearly 200 years ago			0
but @entity8 warned that such a spirit is under threat			0
" we can not let those who do not believe in @entity135 's progress hijack this great experiment , and substitute for the habits of the heart suspicion , hatred , anger , anxiety			2
that 's not as a people who we are			2
" @entity8 on possible presidency : ' i 'm realistic ' she executed the @entity7 game plan as much as @entity8 was the story here , time and again she served as a character witness for @entity7 , whom @entity43 have relentlessly attacked as a carnival barker and @entity14 insider			1
" i 've seen the values that he was raised with , " @entity8 said of @entity7 , standing next to her on stage at the @entity12 , along with his wife @entity161			0
" he grew up in a middle class family			0
he was taught about the dignity of work and the importance of looking out for each other			0
he started his first business at the age of 14 because he knew he was going to have to put himself through school			0
he 's lived those values			2
" the @entity8 appearance was straight out of @entity7 's playbook from day one			1
no one in @entity10 is surprised that his campaign deployed @entity8 at this late stage of the game , an effort to stir up scads of press attention and drown out the cash - strapped @entity42 , who is not even airing television ads in the crucial northern @entity10 media market this weekend , two ad - buying sources told @entity186			1
@entity42 spent saturday rallying the conservative base with @entity188 in central @entity10			1
the @entity45 ' goal is to lock in @entity7 's lead and keep their boot on @entity42 's neck as they head into the final stretch			1
and guess what : former president @entity8 , the big dog himself , will also be campaigning for @entity7 in the coming weeks			0

former secretary of state campaigns for @entity45 *candidate*
setting in @entity10 seems to suit @entity0 's style
appearance mostly *upbeat* , with a few shots at the @entity43
