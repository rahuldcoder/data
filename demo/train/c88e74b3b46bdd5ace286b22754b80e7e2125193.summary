-- a new study by @entity2 finds that , more and more , married mothers are earning more than their husbands -- about 23 % , up from 4 % in 1960			1
that 's nearly one in four families			1
and although men say they support equality , they are struggling with this new reality			1
they had been married for five years when @entity11 was appointed dean of admissions at an elite liberal arts college across the country			0
the couple decided that @entity12 , a busy attorney in private practice , would take some time off to stay home with their two children , who were 1 and 3 , until they decided whether the new town , and her new job , would be a long - term fit			1
the new arrangement worked out well , at least at the start			0
but a few months into her new job , @entity11 wondered if @entity12 was really as happy as he insisted he was			0
she wondered the same about herself			0
although @entity12 was home all day , he still often expected @entity11 to cook dinner			0
he had n't made an effort to make friends or form any connections outside the house			1
" i began to worry about our marriage for the first time ever , " @entity11 told me			0
" as if i 'd forced some change on him			0
he 'd become a different person			0
" although most men say they support -- even welcome -- the idea of a dual income household and equality in marriage , evidence shows that men whose wives earn more may actually be suffering on a number of levels			1
and that although the social pressure that once discouraged women from working outside the home has given way , the pressure on husbands to be the primary earner remains			1
@entity58 and @entity59 were both struggling artists when they met			1
but when they decided to start a family , at least one of them needed a full - time job			1
they decided it would be @entity58 , who had sidelined in real estate for a few months after college			1
turns out , she was very good at selling houses			0
although @entity58 's job afforded @entity59 the ability to continue with his art , he seemed to grow more discontent by the week			2
he began to see a therapist , who suggested that he try antidepressants			0
" i kept having to tell myself that not having to go out and sell houses was a good thing , " he told me			0
" it sounds horrible , in fact			0
i was not jealous of her at all			0
and yet , she was the reason we could afford to pay our mortgage , or go on vacation			0
she was the one who made life possible for our daughter			0
and that was hard to accept , even when i could recognize i was thankful i did n't have to make the sacrifices she was making			2
" @entity59 's feelings are entirely common			2
in " @entity94 and the men they marry , " @entity93 writes that many unemployed or under - earning men feel wounded by what they see as their diminished status			1
their self - esteem can suffer			1
this can eventually lead to feelings of resentment toward their spouse â € ” sometimes conscious , but often unconscious â € ” even if a guy has purposely opted to stay home , take time off , or willingly embark on a less fruitful career			2
a recent study of more than 200,000 men conducted by @entity113 's @entity112 and published in the @entity114 found that men whose wives are the primary earner are about 10 % more likely to require medication to combat such issues as insomnia , anxiety and erectile dysfunction			1
research conducted at @entity124 and presented at the annual meeting of the @entity126 , meanwhile , found that men who earn significantly less than their female partners are five times more likely to cheat than those in relationships where incomes are more comparable			2
but the answer , of course , is n't for women to revert to their traditional roles of cooking , cleaning and tending to the children while the man of the house is off bringing home the bacon			2
as more and more women rise to powerful positions in the workplace , the incidence of female breadwinners will continue to grow			0
husbands of these wives who may be experiencing feelings of depression and low self - esteem would be wise to have an honest conversation with their spouse , and themselves , to find out what 's really bothering them			1
oftentimes , it may not be the fact that their spouse earns more , but that their spouse may have less time to spend at home , or may be neglecting other areas of the relationship			2
for those men who are considering following a less career - oriented path , it 's important for the couple to make a decision together			1
neither member of the couple should feel as if they were forced into a decision , or " trapped			0
" keeping dialogue open between partners helps reinforce the fact that although the man is not working , or is earning less , he is still an equal partner			1
in the case of stay - at - home fathers , it 's important for men to counter any issues of isolation and boredom by making sure they maintain friendships and interests outside the house			1
eventually , through hours and hours of conversations with @entity11 and many ups and downs at home , @entity12 came to not only accept his role as stay - at - home dad , and the lesser earner , but also to enjoy the opportunities it afforded him			2
he was able to coach their son 's soccer team , and he never missed a ballet recital			2
once the kids began school , he reopened his private law practice part - time , taking only those cases that truly interested him			2
" i 'd been worried he was becoming a different person , and he did become one , " @entity11 told me			0
" but turns out different was better			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			1

a @entity2 study finds that in one in four families , mothers make more than fathers
@entity209 : men say they support equality , but are struggling with this new reality
she says husbands feeling low self - esteem must talk it over with spouse to find real reasons
@entity209 : it 's important if a man is not working or is earning less , he is still an equal partner
