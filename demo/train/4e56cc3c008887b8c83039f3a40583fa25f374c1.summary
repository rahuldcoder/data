-- @entity2 's @entity1 , the annual gathering where the secretive company hosts folks who make a living writing software for its products , kicks off today			1
and while the event is designed around presentations to help developers , its keynote address has also become an opportunity for @entity2 to roll out new products not just to developers , but to the world			1
two iphones and several @entity17 have had their coming - out parties at @entity1 , along with a host of operating - system overhauls			2
which raises the obvious question : what will @entity2 announce at its keynote , set for 1 pm et ? speculation has run rampant , as it does every time the @entity27 , @entity28 - based computing giant moves a muscle			1
but some of the guesses make more sense than others			0
here 's a look at some of the most credible reports , with our take on the odds of them being even vaguely true			0
software updates this one is n't as sexy as a big product unveiling , but software is the bread - and - butter of @entity1			0
and there might be some drama here , yet			0
it 's about time for a first look at @entity50 , an update of the mobile operating system that runs @entity16 , @entity52 and @entity2 's other @entity54 - enabled mobile devices			1
the developers in attendance will no doubt hang on every detail			0
but the most high - profile change is expected to be @entity2 's announcement that it 's replacing @entity60 with its own mapping app as the system 's default			1
@entity2 and @entity60 have obviously squared off in the mobile space , with more smartphones now running @entity60 's @entity67 system , even though the @entity16 remains the single most popular phone			1
supplanting @entity60 's popular maps on its millions of mobile devices would be a big blow in the rivals ' ongoing slugfest			2
looking to get the jump on @entity2 , @entity60 announced new features to @entity60 on wednesday , including more @entity77 images and the ability to use the product even when you 're offline			1
interestingly , @entity60 only announced the update for people using its own @entity67 mobile operating system			1
developers also may get a closer look at @entity86 , the @entity17 operating system scheduled for release this summer			1
odds : bet the farm			0
refreshed @entity17 of the nonsoftware speculation , this one feels like the most likely -- and could be pretty significant			0
for one , it 's been a year or more since @entity2 's major desktop and laptop models have been updated			1
the @entity98 got refreshed in may 2011 , the @entity97 's last overhaul was february 2011 and @entity100 's latest model rolled out in july of last year			0
second , apps have started showing up in the @entity17 app store with updates saying they 've added " retina graphics			0
" that 's the term @entity2 uses for its high - resolution displays on newer iphones and @entity52 and suggests that @entity17 might be getting similar treatment			1
plus , the online @entity110 was down monday morning , suggesting that new hardware is on the way			0
@entity2 followers have already been passing around reports that the company could unveil a 15 - inch @entity97 in a big rollout that might include most of its other @entity17 products			1
announcing now would mean that @entity2 would have fresh products to push before back - to - school and off - to - college time , not to mention the holidays			2
odds : get your chips on the table			0
@entity124 a television set from @entity2 has been the most elusive and speculated - about piece of vaporware in the tech world for the past year			1
whether it 's been snippets of info from @entity2 's supply chain , suggestive notes from retailers or the always talkative " unnamed sources , " most observers seem to agree it 's just a matter of time before the company goes from offering a set - top box like @entity139 , @entity140 or @entity141 to selling its own @entity142			1
could monday be the day we finally see it ? maybe ... but it does n't feel likely			0
instead , look for another update to the @entity124 system , the little box that lets users stream movies and other content from @entity151 to their tvs			1
such a move could be a step towards @entity2 launching the tv set itself			2
one report says the company will introduce a kit for third - party developers who want to build apps for the @entity124 device			1
by @entity2 standards , @entity124 has n't been a big seller yet			1
and things are getting more interesting in that space			0
last week , @entity166 announced @entity167 , a system that will synch that gaming and entertainment console with mobile devices like @entity52 and iphones			1
odds : even money at best			0
a new iphone as of this writing , longshot @entity176 is getting 60 - to - 1 odds to win saturday 's @entity178			2
if those odds seem way too good for you , bet on a new @entity16 be unveiled monday			2
yes , new iphones were unveiled at @entity1 in 2009 and 2010			0
but last year 's @entity183 did n't hit the market until october			0
it would be out of character for the company to roll out another one eight months later			0
same goes for the @entity52 and ipods			2
new ipods usually get their own fall events , and the " new @entity52 " is barely three months old			2
even @entity2 does n't crank out updates that fast			2
odds : slim , meet none .			0

company could also unveil its replacement for @entity60 on @entity16 , @entity52
