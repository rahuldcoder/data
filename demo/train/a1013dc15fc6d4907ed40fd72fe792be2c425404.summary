-- look miles into the future and imagine a day , when geneticists can design a flawless set of human genes in a laboratory			1
that future vision may never arrive , but it has taken a step closer			0
scientists have built a designer chromosome and inserted it into a cell , geneticist @entity9 from @entity10 announced this week			1
the chromosome was a heavily altered version , a departure from its natural counterpart			2
a team of scientists from around the world made 500 changes to its genetic base			1
" when you change the genome , you 're gambling , " said @entity9 , who led the project			0
" one wrong change can kill the cell			2
" but the cell survived and made use of its new chromosome			1
it also reproduced , and subsequent cells carried the new chromosome forward			1
actually , make this breakthrough a second step closer to that way - out - there future			2
researchers were already able to duplicate a chromosome on a computer four years ago , build it in the lab , insert it into a cell and watch it work			1
it was a huge advancement that created the first synthetic bacteria cell , scientists said then			1
but , now , there 's been a leap forward , @entity9 said			0
" our research moves the needle in synthetic biology from theory to reality , " he said			0
it makes scientists more able to alter the design of living things			1
meet yeast -- your cousin the new chromosome and the cell @entity9 's scientist built it for are much more complex and are closer to those of a human being			1
the kind of cell @entity9 used ? @entity70 's yeast			1
yeast cells , human cells , plant and animal cells have in common that they are " eukaryotes " -- cells with a nucleus wrapped in membrane			2
our chromosomes , which are located in those nuclei , are made of enormously long strings of @entity82			2
they are wound up like twists of yarn that take on that familiar " x " shape many associate with the genes they contain			0
and they are called eukaryotic chromosomes			0
@entity9 's breakthrough represents the first report that a whole eukaryotic chromosome was constructed from scratch , @entity10 said			1
@entity9 and his team call their new designer chromosome " @entity97			1
" @entity99 knitting task it took seven years and the help of 60 students to build @entity97 with the help of computer modeling			1
each student put together about 1,000 genetic molecule pairs called " base pairs " to make strings of @entity82			0
they were joined together to make a genetic strand 273,871 base pairs long			0
that 's actually shorter than the yeast 's natural chromosome , which contained 316,667 base pairs			1
and that 's where the design and manipulation come in			0
@entity120 and his team took out 47,841 base pairs that were repeats of other pairs -- along with some " junk " dna			0
the new designer chromosome is a cleaned up , streamlined version of the original			1
shuffling the genetic deck @entity129 has about 6,000 genes and shares about a third of them with humans , although yeast is a much simpler beast			2
that makes it easier to study			0
in fact , its genetics are probably better known than those of any other living thing , @entity10 said			0
although @entity9 studies human genetics , too , he is not planning to design a set of synthetic human chromosomes			0
but he would like to build all 16 required for an entire yeast cell			1
and he has made some progress already			0
students are figuring out how to make @entity82 strands 10 times as long as the ones they made the first time around			2
it should speed up production of subsequent chromosomes			0
@entity9 also wants to improve upon the yeast cells in the process , now that his team can shuffle its genes around like cards in a deck			2
" it will allow us to ask , can we make a deck of cards with a better hand for making yeast survive under any of a multitude of conditions , such as tolerating higher alcohol levels			0
" that might make for stronger glass of beer , but it could also have other uses : the new cells could possibly be programmed to " brew " medicines , vaccines and fuels .			0

scientists built a designer chromosome and inserted it into a yeast cell
the cell survived , made use of its new genes and reproduced
it took seven years and the help of 60 students to build " @entity97 "
the breakthrough makes scientists more able to design living things
