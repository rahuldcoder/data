online delivery services have a checkered history at best			1
but @entity2 , the app - oriented car service , is giving it another go			1
the company , which lets app users hook up with nearby drivers for hire , has announced @entity10 , which promises to let " your packages travel like a vip			1
" being tested only in @entity14 , it 's a lot like a typical courier service			1
first , users summon up a vehicular courier ( the company 's reportedly adding bike and foot messengers to its fleet )			0
next , the app quotes them a price			0
and then the courier hauls an item or items from @entity28 to point @entity29 the service does n't allow users to order items , such as lunch , and have them delivered			2
it 's just for transporting items already in their possession			0
@entity10 is now an option on the existing @entity2 app in areas where it is available			1
during the initial dotcom boom of the late ' 90s and early 2000s , several online delivery services tried , and failed , to catch on			1
@entity43 is a classic story from the dotcom bubble burst			0
the website , which promised to deliver items such as dvds , food and @entity51 coffee within one hour , raised $ 250 million in capital , launched in 1998 and was out of business by 2001			0
@entity54 , an online grocery - delivery service , went bottom - up the same year , in what some have called the biggest dotcom flop in history			1
but the emergence of mobile technology has some @entity63 players reconsidering the quick - delivery model			2
@entity65 promises delivery of good from local stores in less than two hours for a $ 5 fee			0
the @entity70 app similarly offers food and other goods delivered for prices starting at $ 5			0
prices for @entity75 appear to be higher ( $ 20 - $ 25 ) , more in line with what @entity78 couriers typically charge			0
@entity2 's model is to take 20 % of whatever price their drivers charge			1
@entity2 uses drivers who have applied to participate and who have passed background checks and other vetting to ensure they are properly licensed and insured			2
they must be at least 23			0
the company says it will expand @entity10 to other areas of @entity78 if it succeeds in its initial test phase .			2

@entity2 *rolled* out a new delivery service , @entity10
@entity10 is only available in @entity14 right now
online delivery services have a checkered track record
