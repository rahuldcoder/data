-- twenty years ago , @entity1 , a former @entity2 diplomat , famously worried that @entity3 would exploit democratic elections to come to power , after which they would pull the democratic ladder up behind them			1
instead of one man , one vote , he said , @entity3 wanted one man , one vote , one time			2
last week , @entity13 's president @entity12 , a member of the @entity15 , and his country 's first democratically elected president , seemed to fulfill @entity1 's grim prophecy			1
in a series of unilateral amendments to @entity13 's interim constitution , @entity12 declared that his word " is final and binding and can not be appealed by any way or to any entity , " and that he is empowered to " take the necessary actions and measures to protect the country and the goals of the revolution			1
" but , as shocking as @entity12 's actions are , they do not prove that @entity3 can not be democrats			1
@entity12 's decision to grant himself unquestioned authority was not the final , spectacularly public phase in some hitherto clandestine @entity15 plan to erect a holy autocracy			1
instead , the @entity39 president simply did what @entity39 presidents have been doing for more than 60 years — that is , loosening institutional restraints on their authority in order to more easily fulfill their agendas			1
news : is @entity13 's next strongman ? that @entity12 is an @entity3 is largely irrelevant			1
it 's likely that the autocratic temptation would have seized @entity13 's president regardless of his party or ideological orientation			1
this is not only because @entity13 has had a distressingly long history of powerful executives , it 's also because , at this moment in @entity13 's political history , there is no actor , institution or organization able to keep the presidency in check			1
under such circumstances , even the most earnest democrats would find themselves flirting with authoritarianism — first in the name of the greater good , and then later , when pretenses can be dropped , in the service of naked ambition			0
usually , presidential ambitions are tamed by legislatures , and this was to be the case under @entity13 's interim constitution			1
a parliament was elected in january , but the @entity39 @entity80 dissolved the body once it became clear that @entity12 was on his way to being elected president			1
the ostensible reason for the dissolution was that the parliamentary election law ran afoul of some foggy constitutional provision , but the real reason was that @entity3 dominated parliament , and the court feared that this @entity3 legislature , coupled with a @entity15 president , would lead @entity13 irretrievably down the road to theocracy			1
in the absence of an elected legislature , it was left to the @entity98 -- the consortium of generals who ruled @entity13 for the 18 months following former leader @entity101 's overthrow -- to counteract the presidency			2
but the @entity39 people and the generals had grown weary of each other			0
word in @entity107 was that the septuagenarian minister of defense , @entity108 , wanted a way out , a " safe exit " in which he could live out his days free of the indignities visited upon his old boss , who bounced between prison and infirmary			0
a bargain was worked out			0
the president clawed back the council 's powers and sent the minister of defense and the armed forces chief of staff into cossetted retirement ( while naming them presidential advisers )			0
the political landscape now lay prostrate before him			0
except for the judiciary , and particularly the @entity80			0
to @entity12 , the 17 men ( and one woman ) who make up that body constitute a defiant remnant of the @entity101 order			0
that a clash was inevitable was apparent from @entity12 's first moments in office , when his inauguration was delayed for several hours over his reluctance to be sworn in before the outgoing head of the court			2
business : @entity12 makes his power plays when the president decreed that the dissolved parliament should return to work , the judges shut him down			2
later , he tried to fire @entity13 's attorney general , a @entity101 appointee			1
again , he was told that this was outside his ken			0
rumors swirled that the @entity80 was planning to dissolve the second constituent assembly ; others reported that a court was about to rule the @entity15 itself illegal			0
@entity12 and his men point to these things and argue that he was forced to take action			0
but what 's remarkable is what the president did n't do			2
for all of his complaining about @entity80 's dissolution of parliament 's lower house , and for all the damage that the decision did to @entity13 's democratic transition , the president has indicated that he will uphold it			1
@entity167 , deputy chairman of the @entity15 's political arm , the @entity169 , has publicly called on @entity12 to reinstate the parliament , but a presidential spokesman has said that there are no plans to do so			1
the president 's reluctance to bring back the parliament further reinforces the impression that his main aim is to expand the powers of his office , which he probably believes is better able to put @entity13 right than a raucous legislature packed with unreliable salafists and a fractious " liberal " wing			2
though the @entity15 has generally fallen into line behind the president , there are signs that at least some of its members are deeply uncomfortable with what he has wrought			2
@entity15 politician @entity189 , the speaker of the upper house of parliament and a relative of @entity12 's , was reported to have said , " we wish that the president had conducted a popular referendum on the constitutional declaration , because what he has done has divided the country between the secular and @entity201 forces			1
" ( @entity189 has since denied making the statement			0
) @entity203 , a @entity15 member and a member of the board of @entity13 's journalists union , reportedly said , " despite my membership in the @entity15 , i am a son of the revolution for freedom			1
therefore , i reject unlimited powers for the president , regardless of the reasons and the duration			0
" even some of the president 's defenders have betrayed hints of ambivalence over his radical decision			0
@entity219 , secretary general of the @entity169 's @entity107 branch , declared that " many have a right to be worried " about the president 's move to place his decisions above oversight , and he called for a national dialogue to arrive at a solution that would preserve " the right of the president to perform his duties with full authority without political interference from @entity101 's @entity80 , as well as the right of the political and social forces to receive guarantees against even temporary presidential tyranny			0
" today , the only check on @entity12 's authority comes from the streets			2
and while the protests against the president 's decisions have been surprisingly robust , @entity12 has so far resisted making concessions			2
in a meeting with @entity39 judges , he reassured them that he would limit his use of his new powers , but , as of this writing , his decree still stands			0
though large protests are scheduled , the president may believe that he can afford to wait them out			0
after all , a repeat of the january 25 scenario is unlikely			0
the opposition to the president , though significant , remains fractured and uncoordinated , and in any case is far narrower than it was in 2011			0
the military , which proved essential in removing @entity101 from power , has no appetite for a repeat engagement with the responsibilities of governance , and @entity12 has more legitimacy — at home and abroad — than @entity101 did			2
and @entity12 may believe that the great , silent majority of @entity39 are behind him			2
after all , @entity13 's gdp is about an eighth of the @entity2 ' , and a greater percentage of @entity2 were literate during the @entity273 than @entity39 are today			1
the vast countryside is likely untroubled by the president 's constitutional maneuverings			0
one might be tempted to ask what the @entity2 , @entity13 's greatest foreign patron , can do to set that country on the right course			1
some have suggested withholding aid , canceling loans and other means of pressuring @entity12 to step back from the authoritarian ledge on which he now finds himself			0
these measures may produce flurries of positive statements and signals in the near term , but they wo n't change the fundamental alchemy of @entity39 politics			2
one only need examine the example of @entity295 , which , after almost a decade of @entity2 tutelage has nonetheless glided into a form of dominant party autocracy , to realize that genuinely democratic governance can not be imposed , especially on poor , underdeveloped countries			0
none of this — @entity13 's tradition of executive dominance , its feeble institutions , its weak political organizations or its enervated society — is particularly the fault of the @entity15			1
in fact , if we are to take any lesson from the turmoil on the banks of the @entity315 , it is not that @entity3 ca n't be trusted with @entity13 's presidency , it is that no one can			1
@entity12 may yet reverse course , but odds are that this will not be the last time that an @entity39 leader tries to convince his people that he must kill democracy in order to save it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity328 .			0

@entity39 president @entity12 announced measures *vs.* judiciary
@entity328 : some say this shows an @entity3 party ca n't be trusted to run a democracy
he says the power grab is n't a result of the @entity15 , but of @entity13 's power *vacuum*
