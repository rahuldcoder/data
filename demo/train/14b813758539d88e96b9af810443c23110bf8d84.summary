-- @entity1 ended @entity3 's 100 % home record in the @entity4 with a 1 - 0 win at the @entity6 on monday evening			1
home fans had enjoyed a feast of 42 goals in 11 previous home league fixtures this term , but it was @entity15 's side who walked away with the spoils on this occasion			1
the goal which ultimately settled the match came in the 32nd minute after a threatening @entity1 attack looked to have broken down			2
@entity22 had a shot blocked by @entity24 after @entity25 had cut the ball back from the right , but the ball rolled out invitingly to @entity29 who thundered a low left - foot drive past a helpless @entity32			0
it was a lead that @entity1 deserved after limiting @entity3 to few chances in the first half while operating nimbly on the break			2
the visitors were unlucky not to double their lead a minute before halftime as the excellent hazard this time found space on the left			0
his cross flashed across the six - yard box before falling at the feet of @entity48 , but the @entity50 striker could only direct his shot onto the bar			0
the @entity53 were at it again in the second half when @entity57 's rasping drive clattered the crossbar in the 53rd minute as @entity1 took control against an increasingly wasteful @entity3 side whose best chances came from long range			1
@entity63 forced @entity64 into a fine save from a 73rd - minute free kick and substitute @entity66 ( on for @entity67 ) also went close in injury time , but @entity1 held firm to record a vital win in the title race			2
" i think we played fantastic , " @entity15 told @entity72 afterwards			2
" against a fantastic team to play the way we did i think is amazing			0
" the best team in the @entity4 we beat them twice and especially today we were fantastic			0
they had a couple of chances to score but we had the better chances to kill the game and the players played with fantastic spirit , " he added			0
" while they had the ball we were all very humble and very ready to work defensively and when we had the ball we were trying to play and we played really well			0
" @entity1 return to the @entity6 in just under two weeks to face @entity3 in the fifth round of the @entity90 , where they will look to inflict a third defeat on @entity94 's side this season following tonight 's win and their 2 - 1 league win at @entity99 in october last year			1
defeat for @entity3 not only ends a run of 11 home league wins but an unbeaten run of 20 matches			1
it was also the first time they had failed to score at home since a 0 - 0 draw against @entity108 way back in november 2010 -- a sequence stretching back 61 games			2
