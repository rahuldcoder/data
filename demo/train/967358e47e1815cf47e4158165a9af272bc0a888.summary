@entity0 was , a matter of months ago , one of @entity3 's most liberal cities			1
now locals call it @entity6			2
they say it 's as if the @entity8 of @entity9 have taken over			1
after months of bombardment by the regime and a chaotic lack of control by weak and divided moderate rebels , @entity10 have found a broken society , made it their home , and imposed on it hardline @entity20 law			1
each morning , activists told us , they seem to awake to a more conservative city			0
the " @entity25 " or rulings sometimes appear on town walls			0
many limit women 's rights -- to walk alone , to style or show their hair			1
other edicts come by word of mouth -- no smoking , no cameras			0
behind them are often foreign jihadists from the @entity10 linked militant group the @entity36 , or @entity36			1
the fear that now grips the city can be felt in the shocking bruises on @entity41 's body			0
@entity41 , whose name has been changed out of fears for his safety , was behind some graffiti in @entity0 that told @entity36 to get out			1
they caught him filming too , and dragged him into the burned - out ruins of a church they had torched and labeled as a new @entity36 base			1
@entity41 was then taken to a nearby basement where the torture started			0
" every 15 minutes , someone poured water on me , electrocuted me , kicked me , then walked out , " he said			0
but his own pain , he said , he could handle , as his body eventually went numb			0
it was hearing the pain and the screams of other prisoners he knew that was the hardest			0
" when a person is tortured in front of you , you feel responsible			0
one guy still inside used to call me @entity67 as i taught him about democracy , " he said			0
one @entity36 video -- part of a high - definition , heavily produced social media channel that displays their ideals and exploits -- shows their militants driving through @entity0 at night			1
they pass a poster , put up by @entity36 , encouraging women to wear the @entity36 hijab or partial veil , to " cover their beauty "			1
the militants ' goal , though , is reaching a cafe where they tell patrons smoking will be banned			0
another video shows them burning not only marijuana , but also large numbers of cigarette cartons			0
another shows an @entity36 teacher -- his face blurred -- with a group of schoolchildren , all wearing @entity36 's distinctive black headbands			1
it is extraordinarily dangerous to film inside @entity0			2
activists have been beaten and jailed by @entity36 for doing so			2
but @entity101 has gathered rare video from some activists and from @entity36 's own websites that paint a chilling picture of the rapid lurch towards radical @entity20 ideology in a city now under @entity36 control			1
dozens of interviews with activists and @entity3 have also detailed the story of a city where women -- along with the previously liberal lifestyle of an entire town -- are being rapidly suppressed by militants bent on establishing an @entity36 caliphate across northern @entity3			1
one female activist said : " they are closing hair salons , women ca n't go out at certain times			2
they spat on one girl for disobedience			0
" the speed of change has overwhelmed many who notice that the city is becoming quieter and more conservative each week			0
@entity36 first came into town on may 15 , and swiftly executed men they accused of working for the regime			2
at first , they seemed an @entity20 but better - organized alternative to the rebels who had failed to bring governance or peace to the city for months			2
but slowly a broader agenda emerged and began to gather pace each week , activists told @entity101			0
rebels who opposed @entity36 were at first jailed , sparking protests			2
yet @entity36 became increasingly uncompromising in their grip on the town			2
rules for social conduct in @entity0 , some written and some not , have emerged in the past few weeks			2
they have yet to reach the extent of those seen in the nearby town of @entity157 -- where one poster recently warned thieves would have their hand chopped off -- but locals fear that could come soon			0
anti-isis dissent has been silenced in @entity0 , and many activists and locals we spoke to have fled the town			1
some stay and spray - paint graffiti declaring that @entity36 and @entity3 president @entity170 are the same , or telling @entity36 to get out			1
locals note the irony in the fact that @entity36 beats them for this graffiti , just in the same way that the @entity170 regime was accused of torturing young people for anti-government graffiti in the southern town of @entity180 -- an incident that began the revolution in march 2011			1
for many , @entity36 is now something worse than the regime			0
is @entity10 taking over northern @entity3 ? how jihadis are being smuggled through @entity185 @entity3 rebels embrace @entity188 law			1

@entity0 , one of @entity3 's most liberal cities , has been *seized* by @entity10 - *backed* militants
@entity193 has gripped the town as militants have imposed hardline @entity36 laws in recent months
women 's rights have been *curtailed* and many activists and locals have fled the town
activist : " it 's like @entity9 . now people call @entity127 . "
