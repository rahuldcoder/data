if @entity2 under correctional supervision counted as a city of their own , they would form the largest city in the @entity6 after @entity7			1
the number of people in prison , on parole or on probation , 6.9 million @entity2 , exceeds the populations of the second - and third - largest cities , @entity15 and @entity16 , combined			1
or the size of the next four -- @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 -- put together			0
thirty - eight @entity6 states are home to fewer people than live under the corrections system in this country			2
there are about as many people behind bars as live in @entity16			2
that 's one in every 108 @entity2			1
one in 35 are under some form of correctional supervision			1
among @entity2 , the numbers are even more horrifying			1
according to the @entity37 , one in three black males born in the @entity6 today is likely to spend time in prison at some point in his life			2
that 's compared with one in six @entity44 males or one in 25 white males			0
it would be hard to overstate the scale of this tragedy			0
for a nation that loves freedom and cherishes our rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , the situation should be intolerable			0
it is destroying lives and communities			0
our corrections system is not correcting			2
within three years of being released from prison , nearly half of prisoners are convicted of another crime with one out of every four ending up back in prison			2
when a typical bureaucracy does its job this badly , it wastes money , time and paper			0
the corrections bureaucracy , in failing to correct the large majority of inmates in its charge , not only wastes money but also wastes lives , families and entire cities			0
the current system is broken beyond repair			2
it 's a human , social and financial disaster			0
we need a radical strategy of replacement of these huge bureaucracies that lack any meaningful oversight			2
a number of states , most recently @entity89 , have already begun to take important first steps by directing nonviolent offenders to community supervision and other forms of correction			1
these measures keep violent offenders off the streets and lesser offenders out of prison , where too often the only education they receive is how to become a more hardened criminal			1
in @entity104 , judge @entity103 has pioneered a model of probation enforcement that has dramatically reduced violations through consequences that are immediate , predictable and proportionate			0
@entity7 created a social impact bond to finance prisoner rehabilitation programs run by a nonprofit organization			2
they will pay out to investors based on savings from a decline in recidivism			0
there are no doubt countless similar reforms that would reduce rates of incarceration , and we should pursue them			0
but it is also time for more fundamental changes			0
we need to rethink prisons , parole and probation for the 21st century			2
at a time when high - quality education is increasingly digital and in many cases free , should n't we provide opportunities for prisoners to learn skills that will enable them to support themselves as upstanding citizens when they are released ? we know that inmates who earn a ged while incarcerated are substantially less likely to return to prison			1
there are readily available online tools that our prisons could use extensively for a minimal cost to increase the number of inmates receiving valuable education and skills training			1
@entity145 has replicated virtually the entire k - 12 curriculum online for free			2
@entity147 and other online education sites offer introductions to software programming for free			1
our prisons should be using tools such as these extensively			2
they offer the opportunity to interrupt the cycle of poverty , a failing education system , crime and incarceration			1
at most prisons , however , inmates would never be allowed to spend eight hours a day working on educational courses and are instead forced to mill about their cells with little or nothing to occupy their time			0
of course , there are significant barriers for convicted felons to get jobs even with education programs			0
but without some training , it 's almost impossible for many			0
and with tight budgets and increasing prison populations , states have already been cutting back on the rehabilitation component			1
technology should revolutionize more than just the prisons ' rehabilitation programs			1
it should completely transform the corrections and criminal justice systems			0
@entity183 is involved in a computer science education initiative for urban youth called @entity186 , which in february held a " hackathon " with students in @entity190 , @entity191			0
one of the hacks the kids came up with was an app to remind them of their court dates			0
it 's sad , but in an age when the dentist 's office calls automatically to remind us of appointments , should n't the court system do that as well if it prevents kids from spending time in jail ? similarly , technology should enable much more effective probation and community supervision , especially new options that could allow nonviolent offenders to remain with their families living productive lives under an appropriate level of restriction			1
almost any activity to which we might sentence low - level offenders -- apprenticeship programs , school , literacy or computer science boot camps , community service -- would be a better use of taxpayer dollars than sticking them idle in prison with hardened criminals			1
unfortunately , the current corrections bureaucracy has embraced none of this innovation -- in part because it is captive to the prison guards ' unions or the private prison lobby , and in part because it lacks any incentives or sufficient competition based on the right metrics			1
the incarceration industry has grown into a billion dollar industry , with corrections being among the most expensive budget items in many states , increasingly outpacing what they spend on higher education			0
opinion : justice system is failing young black men years ago , @entity183 proposed that states give wardens a financial incentive to cut the rates of recidivism for inmates leaving their prisons			1
more than 65 % of inmates in @entity191 return to prison within three years of their release , where they will again cost taxpayers an average of $ 47,000 each year			0
surely it is worth giving wardens a substantial portion of the savings for every inmate that leaves their prison and does not re-offend			1
such incentives would spark dramatically more innovation and investment in rehabilitation , job training and job placement programs for prisoners			1
that would be a revolutionary change from prison administrators ' current incentives , which are often to keep as many people in custody as possible			0
finally , we need real market competition that rewards success at every step of the process -- in probation and parole offices as well as prisons			0
that does n't just mean privatizing prisons or rewarding probation services with the same failed metrics			1
we need competition of methods and ideas based on the right criteria : when we send prisoners home , do they have the skills to reintegrate in their communities as working , law - abiding citizens ? or do they end up coming back ? with more than 2 million of our fellow citizens in prison and millions more in danger of returning , @entity2 on both the left and the right should be able to agree on the need to replace our broken corrections system and work together to do so			1
through rebuild the @entity317 's # cut50 initiative , at @entity319 's " crossfire " and elsewhere , we will be working together to explore ways to reduce the prison population substantially in the next decade			0
we should start by opening our prisons and probation offices to innovation to save money , achieve better outcomes for individuals and ensure better safety for us all .			1

a vast number of @entity2 are behind bars or under correctional supervision
@entity334 , @entity335 : the prison system does n't work ; it turns out more hardened criminals
they say radical innovation is needed to make prisons focus on rehabilitation
*authors* : online education should be used ; wardens should be incented to improve results
