-- it was the perfect summer day for a wedding			2
for nine hours , @entity5 photographed the memorable moments			1
" i took one break for 15 minutes , to eat really quickly , " @entity7 recalled			1
" you do n't want to miss the shots ; that 's what you are paid for			2
" later that night , she pulled into the driveway of her @entity15 , @entity16 , home			2
she walked inside , put down her gear and ran to the bathroom			2
" i just started puking and puking and puking , " she said			2
" i was just grateful that i had n't puked at the wedding or on the bride			2
" @entity7 is six months pregnant			1
she 's already had two children			2
but this time , she 's carrying a baby for someone else			1
surrogate sisters : the ultimate gift her past pregnancies were relatively easy			1
she did have morning sickness with both her sons : @entity31 , 7 , and @entity32 , 3			2
this time , it 's more severe			2
she is sick most days , all day			2
anti-nausea medicine helps , but only to a point			0
sleep is the only thing that makes her feel better			0
there are many days the 31 - year - old stays in bed until 2 p.m. " i have my off days , where i am crying a lot			2
in fact , i may start crying again right now , " she said			0
" but i would totally do it again			0
" family ties about two hours south of @entity15 , @entity50 lives with her husband , @entity51			1
@entity51 is @entity5 's brother			1
@entity50 and @entity51 met on a blind date , fell in love and got married in 2008			1
@entity50 got pregnant within the first month of trying			1
she had an easy pregnancy , and she was thrilled when her son @entity55 was born in 2010			2
" he was the perfect mix of both of us , " she recalls on her family 's blog , which they 've been using to share their journey			0
" those huge eyes melted my heart			0
" after nurses whisked @entity55 away to clean him up and check his vitals , a doctor began stitching @entity50 up			1
but an hour and three packs of thread later , she was still bleeding			0
concerned , the doctor pushed on @entity50 's uterus			1
she was losing blood quickly			0
the highs and lows of foreign surrogacy " i prayed two things before they began , " she wrote			0
" i prayed that i would make it through safely for my husband and my son and that they would put me under because the pain was so horrible i did n't think i could handle any more			0
" @entity51 and her dad were by @entity50 's side when she woke up after surgery			1
unable to talk because she still had a breathing tube , she scribbled a note			0
" were you scared ? " she asked			0
" did they take my uterus ? " @entity51 told her the bad news			0
to save her life , doctors removed it			0
we can adopt. " it took a week for the news to set in			0
@entity50 could have no more children naturally			1
her dream had always been to have three			0
a few days later , @entity7 headed over to the @entity105 ' house to take pictures of the new family			1
@entity50 confided how conflicted she felt : she was grateful for @entity55 but also mourning the loss of the children she would never have			1
@entity50 mentioned to @entity7 that she still had her eggs			1
she and @entity51 were considering using a gestational surrogate			2
an embryo , created in a @entity114 dish from @entity50 's egg and @entity51 ' sperm , would be implanted in the surrogate mother			1
none of the surrogate 's dna is involved			2
" i was pissed ! " @entity7 recalled			1
she was worried : what if the surrogate drank or smoked or did something to harm herself ? she did n't want the @entity125 to take that chance			2
suddenly , @entity7 blurted out , " i 'll do it ! " embarrassed , she immediately covered her mouth and apologized			1
" i thought you did n't want any more children , you were done being pregnant			0
" " yes , " @entity7 responded , " we do n't want any more natural children of our own ... but i have this perfectly good uterus ! " they hugged and cried and cracked jokes about @entity7 carrying her brother 's baby			1
but by the end of the visit , the sisters - in - law decided to talk with their husbands			1
what did they think about @entity7 helping @entity50 become a mom again ? for weeks , both couples weighed the pros and the cons. could @entity50 and @entity51 afford it ? it would cost them about $ 35,000			1
were there any health risks to @entity7 ? after all , as they knew from @entity50 's experience , pregnancy is n't without risk			1
finally , what about the emotional toll ? " i remember thinking , what if i did n't want to give up the baby ? " @entity7 said			1
four months later , all of them were ready to move forward			0
@entity7 would help @entity51 and @entity50 expand their family			1

according to the @entity168 , 1,448 babies were reported conceived via gestational surrogacy in 2010 and carried to full term			0
there are no statistics on relationships between carriers and the intended parents			0
@entity7 and @entity50 contacted @entity176 , a medical practice that specializes in fertility issues			1
even though they were family , both couples had to hire attorneys and negotiate a contract that address a wide range of questions , from who would pay for @entity7 's doctors visits ( the @entity125 ) to the legal process for @entity51 and @entity50 to take custody of the child			1
in @entity191 , it is illegal to pay for a surrogate 's services			2
both couples also had to undergo a psychological evaluation to make sure they were prepared emotionally to go through the process			0
it took eight months from the time they decided to do it until the first embryos were implanted			0
finally , in january , @entity50 's eggs were mixed with @entity51 ' sperm			1
then two embryos were implanted in @entity7			1
that round did n't take			0
" i could not be more honored or more excited to be able to carry their child , " @entity7 wrote in the family 's blog			1

i know i could not do this without him			0
my love for him grows more and more each day			0
" @entity7 and @entity219 were both adopted at birth , and are not related by blood to each other			1

surrogate mom strives for organic living then in april , a surprise			2
" when the nurse first started the scan , she knew right away there were two sacs			0
we were able to see the little heart beats of each one and we were all instantly crying , " @entity7 wrote on the blog			1
an ultrasound showed that she was carrying two boys			1
" they always say @entity243 has a greater plan than you could ever imagine ... well , he has far surpassed that			0
@entity51 and i could n't be happier , " @entity50 added			1
it was around the same time that some unexpected realities set in			0
@entity7 started getting sick and was exhausted all the time			1
that made it hard for her to work			2
it also meant the majority of the housework , cooking and child care ended up falling to @entity214 , an aspiring filmmaker			0
@entity7 is quick to point out that the @entity105 and others help as they can but admits it 's still difficult			1
" it 's been hard ; i 've been quite stressed out through this process , " @entity7 said			1
it 's also been a strain on his budding career			0
" my career is just starting to kick off , and i 've had to slow down a bit on that , and that 's been tough			0
" @entity7 also feels guilty that she 's missing this time with her boys			1
her 7 - year - old son , @entity31 , has especially been affected			2
" i think sometimes that i want to help her a little bit			0
... i just do n't want her to be sick , really , " he said			0
recently , things have been turning around			0
@entity7 has begun feeling better			1
she is n't getting sick as much			0

on a recent afternoon , @entity7 felt well enough to take her sons clothes shopping and , as a special treat , to @entity282 to pick out a toy and then out to dinner			1
the babies are due in december			0
" i 'm excited for the boys to be here , to see what they 're like and for them to be with @entity51 and @entity50 ... but in a selfish way , i am also looking forward to being done , " she said			1
still , she has no regrets			2
" these babies would n't exist if it were n't for this tough decision			0
there are a lot of new challenges i was n't aware of , but i kind of think that 's life , too			0
you kind of sign up for some things , and you hope you 're strong enough to handle it , and hopefully you are			0
and hopefully , i am			0
