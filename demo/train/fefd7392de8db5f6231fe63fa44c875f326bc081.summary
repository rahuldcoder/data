a new formula to decide the seedings has been implemented for the first time which sees teams selected on rankings places alone , rather than basing the decisions on rankings and previous tournament performances			1
under the previous formula @entity31 , who qualified in controversial fashion with a playoff victory over the @entity35 , would have been seeded instead of @entity17			2
had november 's rankings been used @entity31 could have been seeded instead of @entity22 , @entity1 's general secretary @entity37 told the @entity39 this would have been unfair			1
" we made the decision last month that the october rankings would be used because they were fairer , " said @entity37			2
" countries who had been involved in the play - offs would have had an unfair advantages because they would have played more games and that affects their rankings			0
" @entity52 , semi-finalists in 2006 , join @entity31 and the other @entity54 qualifiers in @entity55			0
as always geographical criteria is taken into consideration with the draw , meaning each group will contain a maximum of two @entity54 teams but no two teams from the remaining confederations can be drawn together			0
