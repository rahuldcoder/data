-- as the @entity3 partial government shutdown continues into almost a third week , the stakes are growing			1
of upmost concern is not a lengthy closure of the federal bureaucracy , but that @entity7 could default on its debt around october 17 , unless the debt limit is raised by @entity10			2
the impact of default could be catastrophic , and not just economically			1
as secretary of state @entity14 asserts , this would send a message " of political silliness " that we " ca n't get our own act together " so we need to " get back on a track the world will respect			1
" in other words , the country 's reputation as a responsible international power , both in terms of domestic and foreign policy , is being undermined			1
recognizing the gravity of the situation , president @entity28 cancelled his important week - long trip to @entity32 to try to secure a breakthrough			0
internationally , the spectacle of what is perceived as @entity7 's growing political dysfunction in recent years is as bemusing as it is alarming			1
and , according to some data , this is a driver behind a decline in the country 's international reputation			1
for instance , the 2012 - 2013 @entity43 shows a continued fall in the international ranking of the @entity3 compared to other nations			1
based on a sample of about 3,600 people in 18 countries , it concludes that the country is " in decline , " partly because of " successive fiscal crises			0
" this builds on earlier studies by the organization , including in 2011 - 12 which highlighted " intensified speculation about @entity3 's long - term stability , " partly as a result of the downgrade by @entity61 's of the country 's credit rating			1
this was prompted by the last near debt default of @entity7 in 2011			2
these findings on the @entity3 's reputation are echoed by the 2013 @entity70 , which interviewed about 26,000 people in 25 countries , and also the 2013 @entity73 based on a sample of about 37,600 in 39 countries			1
the @entity70 poll recorded a fall in positive views towards @entity3 for a second consecutive year , while the @entity73 survey found that pro- @entity3 sentiment is slipping , after a strong bounce following @entity28 's election in 2008			1
to be sure , the scale of reputational damage is not -- currently -- as serious as that which faced the country during the previous @entity89 administration			0
for much of that period , surveys indicated profound international concern with @entity3 foreign and military policies			1
indeed , the country 's reputation had fallen to its lowest level since at least the @entity98			1
then , as now , however , the country retains attractive qualities for many foreigners , including its popular culture and economic innovation			0
and the fact remains that , in times of major urgency , @entity7 can transcend partisan divisions and work in the national interest			0
this was demonstrated , for instance , during the 2008 - 9 financial crisis when @entity10 and the administration acted more swiftly and comprehensively than many other countries to counteract the worst economic turmoil since at least the 1930s			0
this has been key in enabling the country to recover more quickly from recession than some other areas of the world			0
while current problems should therefore be put into context , the situation is nonetheless troubling			0
and this is not the first time this year that a @entity7 political impasse has threatened negative economic repercussions			2
only at the 11th hour did @entity10 in january agree a deal to prevent the @entity3 falling off the " fiscal cliff			2
" it is estimated that the automatic tax increases and spending cuts might well have taken the @entity3 economy back into recession			2
at the core of the current troubles is not just growing polarization between @entity138 and @entity139 , but significant intra-party divisions too			0
this is especially so between moderate and right - wing republicans ( and the @entity144 faction )			0
thus , although house speaker @entity147 , the @entity139 leader in the @entity148 , has pledged that @entity7 will not default , his efforts are being undercut by more conservative colleagues			0
he may therefore have to rely on @entity138 votes to secure approval for raising the debt ceiling in the @entity148			0
political infighting looks likely to only intensify in the build - up to next year 's congressional elections			2
this threatens key reforms on the horizon , including an immigration overhaul , which is of interest to many internationally			0
the perception , in many foreign capitals , is that growing partisanship is also infecting @entity3 foreign policy			1
and , this is feeding angst over the reliability of @entity7 as an international partner , as has been vocalized in recent days by several countries , including @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173			0
already this month , @entity28 has lost the opportunity to advance the @entity176 trade deal as a result of the cancellation of his @entity32 trip			0
meanwhile , @entity3 trade officials were forced to postpone second - round negotiations with @entity183 over the proposed @entity184			2
the gravity of this reputational issue for @entity3 foreign relations was recently acknowledged by two former defence secretaries			1
@entity139 @entity189 asserted that " lack of leadership is sending a signal around the world that the @entity3 is in decline , that that we 're withdrawing , that we as a country are not going to behave in a rational manner			2
" meanwhile , democrat @entity198 bemoaned that by " governing by crisis after crisis after crisis ... the world will view the @entity3 as less able to back its word with power			1
" looking ahead this month , it remains most likely that a deal will be done before october 17 to raise the debt limit			0
and some scholars believe @entity28 has the constitutional power to raise the ceiling without congressional approval , a claim that the @entity213 has so far rejected			0
with uncertainty growing , the only sure thing is that default would send seismic economic and political shockwaves across the globe			1
this would not just further undermine the @entity3 's reputation as a responsible international power , but potentially send it into freefall again			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			0

impact of @entity3 default would send out global economic and political shockwaves
@entity3 reputation as responsible power would be undermined
internationally , *pro-american* views appear already to be sliding
there 's a perception in many capitals that domestic partisanship is infecting @entity3 foreign policy
