-- a three - letter typo has slashed years off a prison sentence for a repeat drug offender in @entity4			1
@entity5 discovered a discrepancy on the verdict form for his conviction			1
@entity5 of @entity9 was sentenced in october 2005 to 10 years in prison after being convicted of possessing more than 100 grams of cocaine , a first - degree felony			1
while serving his time , @entity5 discovered a stray word on the verdict form signed by the jurors who convicted him in @entity19			1
the form , typed up by a court or prosecutor 's office employee , read : " we , the @entity24 , find the @entity26 of the offense of possession of @entity29			1
" we , the jury , further find that the amount of crack cocaine was in the amount exceeding ten one hundred ( 100 ) grams as charged in the indictment			0
" see the document the word " ten " in the second sentence is extraneous			0
@entity5 brought the error to a succession of attorneys ' attention , but no one managed to turn it to his advantage until @entity45 was appointed to represent him			2
" i have never seen anything like this in my life , where just attorney after attorney did nothing , " @entity45 said			0
" i think he had four appellate attorneys , and one appeal ... it 's a very , very bizarre case			0
" under @entity4 law , for a person to be found guilty of a higher - level felony , the jury form must state either the degree of the offense or the circumstances that would make it a higher offense			1
the form 's second sentence apparently was an attempt to state those circumstances , but the stray word muddled the meaning , @entity45 said			2
a three - judge panel of the @entity72 unanimously agreed			0
" the form is unclear , and we can not determine what the jury understood ' ten one hundred ( 100 ) grams ' to mean , " judge @entity77 wrote in the court 's decision			1
" it certainly could have meant an amount exceeding one hundred grams , but it is possible the jury believed the form actually meant an amount exceeding less than one gram			2
" read the whole opinion the uncertainty meant @entity5 could be convicted of nothing more than a fifth - degree felony , the judges ruled			0
the maximum sentence for a fifth - degree felony is one year , and @entity5 already had served four			2
it seems @entity5 is wanted in @entity94 , @entity95 , on a november 2000 sheriff 's warrant for violating his probation for drug and weapons convictions			1
the sheriff is seeking extradition , spokeswoman @entity100 said			0
it 's unlikely he 'll be able to avoid it , said @entity45 , who will not be able to represent @entity5 because he 's not licensed in @entity95			1
the original judge in the @entity4 case , @entity108 , is retired			1
the @entity110 prosecutor 's office did not return calls seeking comment on @entity5 ' case			0
" at the end of the day , he was convicted , and i understand that some people are going to feel upset that he 's essentially out six years earlier than anyone anticipated , " @entity45 said			0
" but in our system , we give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant , and we do that for good reason			2
and in here there 's a statutory mandate to ensure that we know what we 're convicting people of and we know why we 're doing it			0
and that mandate was n't met			0

error on verdict form casts doubt on jurors ' intent , @entity4 appeals court rules
decision means @entity141 must serve just one year , not 10
legal issue elsewhere may have him *transferred* to @entity95
