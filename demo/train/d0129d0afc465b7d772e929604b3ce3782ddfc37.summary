@entity0 has a solution to everyone who 's been tripped up by " @entity6 " star @entity4 's name : just sing it			1
at the 2015 @entity9 awards gala on saturday , @entity0 -- a " @entity6 " producer -- led the audience in a singalong of actor 's surname			1
@entity4 , who was born in @entity15 , is the son of @entity17 immigrants			2
" in situations like this , i found it sometimes helps to sing it , " he told the audience after their uncertain attempt to say the name			0
" @entity26 , o - yell , o - yell , " he started			0
that did n't quite do the trick , so he tried a couple bars of @entity33 's " @entity32			0
" awards presenters may be getting many chances to say " @entity4			2
" the actor has been nominated for several honors for his portrayal of @entity39 in " @entity6 , " including a @entity40 , and he 's considered a leading candidate for a best actor @entity43			1
as for the mispronunciations , people should n't feel too bad			0
@entity4 told @entity46 that it 's not an easy name to say properly and that his father questions the accents in the @entity52 pronunciation			1
but , he added , that 's ok : his father has trouble with " @entity55 " and " @entity56			0

@entity4 's name has been hard to pronounce for some
@entity0 's solution ? sing the name of the " @entity6 " star
