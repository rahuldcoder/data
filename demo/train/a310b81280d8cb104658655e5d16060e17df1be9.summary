-- a @entity2 politician who drew gasps by evoking @entity4 in a congratulatory tweet to the @entity8 @entity7 team has apologized , in his own inimitable style			1
" when @entity8 whacked @entity10 , i unintentionally said something that hurt d feeling of d ppl in @entity14			2
" a member of the @entity17 , @entity15 posted his initial tweet on tuesday after @entity8 knocked @entity10 out of the @entity7 with an impressive 7 - 1 win			1
. @entity20 ... long live hitler ... " , he tweeted to around 20,000 followers			0
predictably , a flurry of tweets followed , with many questioning @entity27 's sanity and how he came to be in politics			0
to his credit , the mp responded , but perhaps not in a way some might have wished			2
to @ shaike49 's contention that he was a " low class crazy mp , " the politician wrote : " u can get lost ... and enjoy with the loser			2
" to @ layzebone 's direct statement : " you 're an idiot ... educate yourself , " the mp said : " say its to ur self			0
" by thursday , @entity27 's online antics had caught the attention of the @entity2 prime minister @entity46 who tweeted to his two million followers : " the comments made by @entity49 are unacceptable and wrong , and he will withdraw them			1
" he added : ( @entity27 ) " does not speak for @entity2 , or for ordinary @entity2 , who understand @entity53 's tragic past , and respect its modern unity			2
" " this should be a time of celebration for @entity8 , and we wish them all the best in the final			2
" one might think after causing an online furore over a six - word post , the politician might take a break from @entity66			0
within one hour of posting his apology , he responded to a user who said : " try saying this in europe , and see how fast u get gun down , " with " im worried they might gun down u first			0
" on wednesday , @entity75 defended his @entity4 reference , telling @entity2 's @entity77 : " i do n't know what 's wrong with people sometimes			1
" " @entity4 is part of history and the @entity8 team fought like how he did			1
" after initially condemning the comments as " an unacceptable allusion to the fascist regime of @entity4 , " the @entity8 ambassador to @entity2 has now put the episode behind him			1
" with mp @entity49 's apology , i consider this matter closed , " @entity90 said in a statement			0
" let us now look forward to two more thrilling and exciting games			0
" it remains illegal in @entity8 to glorify @entity4 or the @entity97 , or to display symbols of the regime including flags , uniforms and slogans			1
earlier on thursday , the @entity103 also demanded an apology from the mp			0
in a statement on its website , the group 's religious harmony bureau chairman @entity105 said he was " ashamed and appalled " by the tweet			0
" from insulting women to disabled people , @entity111 mp datuk @entity110 is no stranger to controversy , but now his zero common sense in attributing @entity8 's win to @entity4 will make @entity2 the centre of a negative attention once again			1
