@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 has successfully test - fired a new version of its @entity6 missile , which has a longer range than previous models , @entity1 news agencies reported wednesday			1
the @entity9 was designed by @entity1 scientists and is also more accurate than older versions , @entity12			2
gen. @entity13 , @entity1 's defense minister , told state - run @entity14 and the semi-official @entity16 news agency			1
it was n't immediately clear whether the @entity9 is a short - or medium - range missile			2
@entity14 reported it is 9 meters ( 29.5 feet ) long and weighs 3,500 kilograms ( 7,716 pounds )			0
@entity13 claimed that the production of the missile was " another victory in the field of defense and technology , and was another example of busting the sanctions and getting rid of them , " @entity16 quoted him as saying			0
he also denied that @entity1 's implementation of the @entity6 missile was linked to the recent purchase of @entity32 - made @entity31 missiles by @entity33 , according to @entity16			1
" @entity33 is not a threat to us because we have friendly relations with @entity33 ... however , there was no need to have that system ( @entity31 ) in @entity33 , " the minister said			1

on saturday @entity1 also began fueling its first nuclear energy plant in the southern city of @entity48 , according to the nation 's state media			1
@entity14 said the effort would help the country create nuclear - generated electricity			0

the five permanent @entity64 members plus @entity65 offered @entity1 a deal last october : send the low - level uranium out of the country to be enriched elsewhere in exchange for fuel for its reactor			0
