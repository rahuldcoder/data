-- when a disaster of a mega-proportion hits a city - from a terror attack to a hurricane - there are procedures in place to deal with the aftermath			1
suggest that the source of a serious humanitarian crisis could lie in outer space , however , and many will assume you are talking science fiction			1
but one woman is on a mission to convince the world -- and especially governments and the @entity19 -- to take threats such as potential asteroid strikes more seriously			1
meet @entity22 , designer of experiences at the @entity24 ( @entity25 in @entity26 , creator of the @entity29 - an orchestra composed of space scientists - and trainee astronaut			1
" this is n't a @entity37 film , this is real life " , says the 29 - year - old , from @entity33 , @entity34			2
speaking from @entity24 , @entity39 rattles off statistics about space , dissects doomsday scenarios , contemplates the possibility of aliens and brings names such as @entity46 to @entity47 into the conversation			2
she has been called the ' @entity50 of design and science ' and her latest project , @entity54 , is a documentary film , about scientists preparing for disasters from space that could threaten @entity59			1
@entity39 speaks to illustrious space scientists from @entity24 , @entity62 's @entity61 ( @entity64 ) project and @entity54 and @entity65 ( @entity66 ) including : extra-terrestrial intelligence specialist dr. @entity67 ( the inspiration for @entity70 's character in the film contact ) , and meteor shower expert dr. @entity72			1
so what do you do in the case of hazardous asteroids or a small @entity64 ) ? answer from @entity54 : there are different mitigation techniques in place : kinetic impactor , blast defection , combination methods , gravity tractor ( a spacecraft to deflect an asteroid using only its gravitational field to transmit impulse )			1
alternative methods : moving asteroids with lasers , focusing sun energy , changing thermal properties , electro - static pushing and reflecting white paint			2
@entity39 investigates such real - life procedures in place to deal with the threat of an asteroid collision and how critical information would flow up the chain of command			1
" who are the people who would make the decision and what would be the basis of their decision - making ? " she asks			0
there are 20 people before the president is alerted and before ' the red button is pushed '			0
there might be something to be gained from revealing problems to the public in order to help secure funding which is a " big difficulty " she explains			0
" humans are more willing to support a cause if you understand the difficulties involved			0
" as well as the film , to be released on march 2015 , she 's also relying on an app , exhibitions and " immersive experiences " such as the one at the @entity128 in @entity129 as part of the @entity131			0
she is determined to promote the role of women in the male - dominated space industry			1
@entity39 recalls how she was once one of two women in a room of 1,500 people at the @entity139			2
" this is my massive fight , " she says with gusto			0
" how are these space agencies making choices on what we need ? it occurred to me that the people making these decisions are men -- space science is a field which is 90 % men , men men ! we need women - let 's face it we would come up with way smarter solutions ! " but in all seriousness , @entity39 warns that efforts to find and fund ways of dealing with the asteroid threat must continue			1
" it 's not like i can say ' yes , we have a solution ' , " she said			0
" it 's only going to the @entity19 now			0
they are aware of their responsibility but at the moment they are just putting in place the committees			0
" " nobody knows exactly what the @entity19 response would be and that 's a real problem , " said @entity39			0

@entity54 follows scientists planning for space catastrophes
' *failure* is not an option ' mantra associated with space exploration
women need to be promoted in space industry
funds to deal with asteroid threat must continue
