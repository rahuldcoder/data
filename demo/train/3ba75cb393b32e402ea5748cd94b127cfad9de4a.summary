-- this is not your typical @entity2 sunday			1
there are things that are down			2
the temperature , for one			2
ticket prices , in some cases , are another			1
a few things are up			2
the cost of the ads many people will be tuning in for -- a record $ 4.5 million			1
the security presence , even by @entity2 standards , will be big			1
so how about some good news ? weather forecasters say that by game time -- note to party hosts , 6:30 p.m. et --- a clipper system will have moved through @entity20 , leaving just a few inches of new snow behind in @entity23			1
temperatures will be in the mid- 30s at kickoff			0
that 's not as nice as past @entity2 sites like @entity28 ( high of 79 on sunday ) , @entity29 ( 81 ) or next year 's host city , @entity32 , @entity33 ( 73 ) , but compared with what might have happened this crazy winter , it must be the @entity37 's best imagined scenario			1
not that they have n't planned for other possibilities			1
" we feel like we 're prepared for every alternative , " @entity37 commissioner @entity40 told @entity44 's " @entity43 " on monday			0
that included moving the time of the game if league officials felt like the safety of the fans was in jeopardy			0
" we 're working with all the officials here			0
we 're pretty comfortable we 'll be playing at 6:30 on sunday night			0
" @entity40 has said he will sit out in the stands , just as the late @entity54 did at @entity55 when it was 39 degrees for the kickoff in @entity59 at @entity60			0
@entity61 predicts exciting overtime finish security by land , sea and air huge sporting events like the @entity68 and @entity2 always draw large security forces as did prior events at @entity71 , site of sunday 's game			1
lt. col @entity73 of the @entity74 told @entity0 this is a different ballgame			1
there will be more than 700 troopers in and around the stadium complex , he said			0
but they wo n't be the only people guarding the game			1
" there 's eyes all over the place , whether it 's state , local , federal or county assets there , " he told @entity0 's @entity82			0
that also includes 3,000 private security guards on site			1
and extra security for mass transit options because there will only be 12,000 parking spots at the game for 80,000 fans and 5,000 media members			1
live updates from @entity99 " there is a template within the @entity37 and there are certain things that we follow with the @entity37			0
but we have to use our own template because every city is different , " he told @entity0			0
" obviously it 's different than other @entity2 because of our proximity to @entity110			1
" the proximity of the stadium to waterways and railways will mean extra @entity116 boats on game day and more planes from federal agencies in the sky equipped with infrared and night - vision systems			0
@entity123 officials said federal agencies , including the @entity125 , will deploy hundreds of employees to assist @entity20 and @entity110 police secure what 's been officially designated " an event of national significance			1
" and there is one noticeable difference for fans , a change instituted for this @entity37 season			0
in light of the bombings at the @entity143 , if fans want to bring a bag bigger than 4 Â½ by 6 Â½ inches , it must be clear plastic			0
( even the garbage being taken out has to go in clear bags )			0
an affordable @entity2 ? well , not quite for many fans			1
but prices of game day tickets on the secondary market have been sliding since the @entity151 and @entity152 each won their conference championship games			1
on the @entity37 's official ticket exchange site , more than 3,300 tickets were available , starting at a little more than $ 1,600			1
there were almost 4,800 tickets on @entity159 , a popular online ticket reseller			2
as @entity162 points out , with the game in the @entity110 metropolitan area and featuring a top - rated offense versus a top - rated defense , it seemed like prices would have been astronomical			2
but that has n't been the case in the past week			2
@entity170 , which aggregates listings from ticket resellers , said the @entity2 might be the least expensive since 2002 , according to the @entity173			1
@entity174 said the prices for all seats has dropped 40 % since the two conference championship games about nine days ago			2
the big drop in prices for the game have been in the end zone and upper deck seats , the paper reported			2
@entity170 spokesman @entity184 told the @entity185 : " strong supply and uncertainty about the weather forecast has helped to keep prospective buyers on the sideline for now , driving prices downward at a record rate			1
" so now that the weather will be practically balmy for this time of year , back accounts might be emptied after all			2
@entity196 ticket prices continue to drop as game day approaches or just watch on tv watching the game on television means seeing all of the famed @entity2 commercials			1
that way you 'll get to see all 32 minutes and 30 seconds with the other partygoers without having to watch online the next day			0
of course you can get a glimpse of some of the ads before the game and not have to slip off to the bathroom during actual game action			2
for some companies the game is an opportunity to take $ 4.5 million to say " hi " to new potential buyers			0
" @entity2 for us is a risk			1
we do a lot of marketing , but it 's the first time we 'll hit a really mass consumer audience , " @entity220 ceo @entity219 told the @entity221			0
@entity220 is among the companies that have posted a commercial on @entity227 already			0
the company 's blog said it will also release an extended version of the spot and some of the material that was cut after the game			0
there will also be one ad from a small company that wins a 30 - second commercial paid for by financial software company @entity238			0
the contest was open to any @entity241 - based business with 50 or fewer full - time employees			2
the commercial will air during the third quarter			0
this year 's @entity2 will have 43 advertisers , according to @entity244			1
@entity0 's @entity245 and @entity246 contributed to this story .			0

forecasters say @entity196 weather should be good
@entity74 bringing in hundreds to be part of large security presence
ticket prices on secondary market are n't as high as some thought they might get
@entity2 ads to feature a *newcomer* and a contest prize winner
