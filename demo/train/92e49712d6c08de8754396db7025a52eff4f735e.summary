] an open bay shower that someone you believe to be a gay or lesbian service member also used , which are you most likely to do ? " -- question on 2010 @entity8 and @entity9 * it seems that ensuring shower security for @entity13 soldiers and @entity14 is critical to maintaining our global military pre-eminence			1
if our brave men and women can not comfortably bathe in environments free from the risk of homosexual lust , how can we expect them to battle armed @entity23 insurgents and other enemies ? in order to assess the gay shower hazard and other threats to military readiness if the @entity30 " policy were repealed , the @entity8 surveyed @entity13 troops over the summer			1
adm. @entity32 , the chairman of the @entity33 , found the results reassuring			0
he told the @entity35 , " repeal of the law will not prove an unacceptable risk to military readiness			1
... i believe our troops and their families are ready for this , " although he acknowledged , " some soldiers and @entity14 may want separate shower facilities			1
" sen. @entity46 , despite having promised in 2006 to respect the judgment of military leaders , disputed the results of the survey			2
he questioned whether the sample size was representative and noted that soldiers and @entity14 in combat units were especially concerned about the effects of repeal			2
insisting that " one of our highest responsibilities is to the men and women of our armed services , " the @entity35 's self - declared straight - talker demurred , " it may be premature to make such a change at this time and in this manner , without further consideration of this report and further study of the issue by @entity72			1
" while the government certainly has profound responsibilities to the men and women of our armed services , it is not clear why the precise breakdown of their opinions on " do n't ask , do n't tell " matters one whit when assessing whether gays and lesbians are permitted to serve with them			2
when president @entity84 ordered the armed forces to integrate in 1948 , he did not first commission a survey asking white soldiers what they would do if they had to share a shower bay with a black soldier			2
if he had , the response in an era of segregated bathrooms would have been unenthusiastic to say the least			0
there had been some 1940s military surveys about integrating the armed forces ; they showed that opposition by white soldiers ran as high as 80 percent			0
but as @entity84 knew , civil rights are not a matter of popular opinion			1
" whereas it is essential that there be maintained in the armed services of the @entity13 the highest standards of democracy , " he wrote in the executive order , " there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race , color , religion , or national origin			0
" of course , most of those who support the military 's prohibitions against gays and lesbians reject the analogy			1
they do not believe that @entity13 's servicemen and women deserve equality of treatment without regard to sexual orientation			0
but if gays and lesbians have no right to equality of treatment , why bother with surveys at all ? the military could just bar them from serving , as it used to			1
or they could even take the matter to the logical extreme by emulating the old racist segregationists			0
if sexual orientation is not a civil rights issue , why not create segregated units ? gays and lesbians could have their own barracks , their own ships and their own shower bays			1
they could even design their own uniforms , adding to those dull dress whites with optional leather pants , fishnets and sequined cocktail dresses			0
not only would segregated units aid military recruitment , they would boost morale among the straight troops by siphoning now - closeted gay and lesbian troops into the new homosexual units			1
straight soldiers and @entity14 would no longer have to worry about being surreptitiously ogled in the shower by gays and lesbians pretending to be straight , so they would be able to battle @entity23 insurgents with even more unity and effectiveness			1
there is one potential problem			0
because of a shortage of homosexual officers , straight officers would have to lead homosexual units until new gay and lesbian officers could be trained this might cause morale problems among the straight officers			0
fortunately , officers are likely to have private showers , avoiding at least one problem			0
they could also be selected from among those who indicated that if they were assigned to a shower bay with gays or lesbians , they could choose the answer : " take no action			2
" other than the officers and the uniforms , the homosexual units would be equal in every way to the straight units : separate but equal			0
it 's a perfect solution			0
unless , that is , sexual orientation is a civil rights issue after all			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity197			2
* answers : 1 ) take no action 2 ) discuss how we expect each other to behave and conduct ourselves while sharing a room , berth or field tent 3 ) talk to a chaplain , mentor , or leader about how to handle the situation 4 ) talk to a leader to see if i have other options 5 ) something else 6 ) do n't know			0

@entity197 : military asked troops what they feel about sharing showers with gays
so this means shower security is crucial to battle readiness , @entity197 asks
if things are this *absurd* , why not take it to the next level : segregated units , he writes
@entity197 : polling troops is *irrelevant* when it 's an issue of civil rights , like integration was
