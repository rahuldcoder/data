-- they finally called a spade a spade			0
@entity6 @entity5 's new report on the @entity8 nuclear crisis stated that the " fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of @entity6 culture : our reflexive obedience ; our reluctance to question authority ; our devotion to sticking with the program			1
" this admission exposes perhaps the weakest aspect of the @entity6 governance style			2
@entity6 companies are known to be indecisive , always taking a long time to reach any conclusion			2
on the other hand , they make the world 's best consumer products			0
how can one explain this paradox ? in the aftermath of the big earthquake last year , there was a group of 40 @entity6 stranded in a building			1
there was no food in a freezing cold night , except for one cup of instant noodle			0
the 40 people calmly shared that one little cup , without any fight or quarrel			0
stories like this coming out of the affected region illustrate the amazing level of collective discipline that @entity6 have			2
it 's hard to imagine the same behavior anywhere else			0
for the @entity6 , this was n't unusual			2
the reactions to such stories in @entity6 were along the line of : " we knew you 'd hang in there , well done , we 're right behind you			2
" the @entity6 are educated from a very early age to constantly " think about others " and to assess " the positing of one 's self in an organizational context			2
" hence , solidarity within a group setting is very important			0
the unwritten communal rituals , value sharing and group - binding rules are so strong that they can overrule laws			1
in such a culture , the leaders in @entity6 are often selected on a consensus basis			1
in other words , the leader is often the person who can best represent and voice the group 's collective interests			0
individualism and top - down decision - making process are often rejected , especially among traditional organizations like the government or corporations			1
as a result , someone who has original or different ideas is more likely to be cast out of a group			0
this is opposite of the top - down decision - making process that is required for the leaders in @entity87 countries			1
this consensus - based management style leads to an internal " village - like " way of doing things , usually under a closed - door policy			1
it breeds vested interests , which binds the leaders tighter			0
it is not hard to imagine that such organizational traits can easily reject third party 's comments or suggestions , even if they are objective			0
for example , when there was a whistleblower from @entity103 , the first call that the government made to @entity103 was : " hey , you have a whistle blower " instead of " hey , you might have a problem at the nuclear reactor -- look into it			2
" this is when rationality is washed away by excessive formalities and bureaucratic rituals			0
many @entity6 scandals in the past have been the result of this type of behavior			1
when there is no crisis , or when there is little or no paradigm change , the @entity6 decision - making process is not a problem			1
in fact , it can even be advantageous , especially in a corporate environment			0
@entity6 workers are extremely obedient , hard - working and loyal to their group			1
the corporate chief simply pushes his " automatic flight mode " and the plane will glide nicely as the mass will work hard to set the course			0
however , when there is an unanticipated event like an earthquake or tsunami , @entity6 leaders can not cope well			2
this is equivalent to when they are asked to make a decision about crash landing			0
since these leaders have been constantly opting for consensus decision - making process that is based on precedents , when there is no precedent they malfunction			1
strong top - down leadership when needed is simply not there			1
the statement in the @entity8 report says it all -- there is both strength and weakness to the @entity6 style of management			1
the challenge for the @entity6 is to open up to individualism and more top - down leadership while retaining collectivism to some degree			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			0

@entity8 report says nuclear crisis was a " man - made *disaster* "
@entity169 : in @entity6 , group - binding rules are very strong
he says individualism and top down decision - making process are often rejected
@entity169 : can the @entity6 move away from consensus type of management ?
