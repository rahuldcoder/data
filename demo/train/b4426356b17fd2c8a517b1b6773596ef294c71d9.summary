-- back in the summer of 1999 , alternative rock bible @entity1 published a cover story called " @entity5 @entity4 " â € ” even though he had n't produced but a single song in over five years ( the awful " @entity13 , " which appeared on the soundtrack to the @entity9 vs. @entity12 movie @entity10 )			1
all these years and one seriously anticlimactic @entity14 later , the elusive , unpredictable @entity4 still fascinates			2
he 's kept fans and the media at arm 's length by giving hardly any print interviews , let alone televised ones			0
but that all is going to change on october 24 , when he appears on " @entity22 " for his first live broadcast interview in more than two decades			1
@entity4 gets stolen jewelry back @entity25 will go on the show to chat with @entity27 primarily about his band 's upcoming 12 - night @entity28 run at @entity31 ' @entity30			1
hopefully he 'll also discuss his addiction to tardiness , his mysterious hairline , and whether or not the tracks he supposedly recorded with @entity36 at some point in the ' 90s will ever see the light of day			0
it 's telling that , upon hearing this news , one @entity0 staffer immediately quipped , " what are the odds he actually shows up ? " indeed , @entity4 has never been good with deadlines , even when it comes to performing on live television			1
but if the show goes as planned , it will be very interesting to hear what is on @entity4 's mind			0
will he talk about his absence from the band 's induction into the @entity55 ? will he tell stories of lost tapes and crazy re-starts during the @entity14 sessions ? @entity60 on @entity4 : ' i 'm done with him ' perhaps he 'll go into why seemingly all of his guitarists have silly names ( see : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 )			1
with @entity4 , anything is possible			0
what would you want to hear @entity4 talk about ? and does @entity27 seem like a good fit ? let us know in the comments			2
