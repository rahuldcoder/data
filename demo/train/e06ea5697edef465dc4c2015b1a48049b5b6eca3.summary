-- passions run high at the coalface of an @entity4 series and the heat clearly affects those at the pinnacle of @entity8 politics too			1
as his nation battles to win the third test against @entity12 , and keep the five - match series alive , @entity8 prime minister @entity9 has left the game 's officials in no doubt as to his disgust			1
with the match only a few hours old , @entity8 batsman @entity18 was given out caught behind by umpire @entity20 , a call he instantly reviewed			1
and though countless replays offered no evidence @entity18 had hit the ball , the video umpire upheld the on - field decision , condemning the 26 - year - old to a long trudge back to the pavilion			1
@entity9 , who ousted @entity30 in a leadership election to become prime minister for a second time in june , was so incensed he took to @entity34 to voice his displeasure to over 1.3 million followers			1
using modern technology to bemoan cricket 's new - age technology he wrote : " i 've just sat down to watch the test			0
that was one of the worst cricket umpiring decisions i have ever seen			1
" at the close of play on the first day , captain @entity45 's unbeaten century leading his side to a commanding position at 303 - 3 , @entity9 's message had been retweeted 2,759 times			2
his viewpoint was supported by one of @entity53 's greatest ever cricketers , @entity51 , who took 708 @entity54 wickets with his leg spin bowling during a glittering career			1
in his role as a television commentator he labeled the decision " ridiculous " and was one of the thousands that retweeted @entity9 's remarks			2
" there was daylight between bat and ball , there was no hot spot and no noise , " @entity51 said			2
" the only noise was when the bat hit his pad			0
" you can see the bat hitting the pad , the ball goes past , no noise			0
there was clear evidence there as well			0
that is a ridiculous decision			0
" umpiring decisions have caused much controversy in the previous two @entity85 matches , both won by @entity12 , who is looking to retain the ashes for the third straight series			1
under the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) both sides get two reviews per innings , meaning they can refer a decision to a video umpire if they think it is wrong			2
the numerous camera angles available , as well as sound and hotspot technology -- which can detect even the faintest touch of ball on bat -- are designed to eliminate bad calls			0
the game 's governing body -- the @entity104 ( @entity104 ) -- was forced to defend the umpiring during the first test at @entity108 in @entity109 after a clutch of poor decisions , from the on - field umpires and their video counterpart			0
@entity9 is the latest in a long line of @entity8 prime ministers who have indulged their love of cricket			1
@entity119 , who served between 1996 and 2007 , was a regular visitor to test matches involving his country at home and abroad			0
he also launched a bid to become a vice-president of the @entity104 but was blocked by the organization 's board			0
