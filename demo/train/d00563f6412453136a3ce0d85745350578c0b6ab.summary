-- @entity1 * had decided to undergo a breast augmentation			2
she researched doctors and found one she thought was well - qualified ; ads in magazines touted him as board - certified and a top plastic surgeon in the area			1
@entity1 met with him for a consultation and underwent the procedure in his office several weeks later			2
but at home that night , she discovered a shocking sight : her breast implants were lodged in her armpits			2
the next morning , she rushed back to her doctor 's office			0
he inspected her chest and , with a quizzical look on his face , declared , " i have never seen this before			0
" @entity1 decided to seek another opinion			0
a new surgeon explained that the previous physician had botched the procedure			2
she would need extensive surgery to correct it			2
as if this were n't bad enough , he also informed her that her doctor was n't what he claimed to be			2
sure , he was board - certified -- just not in plastic surgery			1
her " plastic surgeon " was actually an eye doctor			1
stories like @entity1 's are becoming more and more common across the @entity37			0
plastic surgery has become the @entity39 of medicine , with an increasing number of doctors performing invasive cosmetic procedures without proper training or credentials			1
in my metro @entity48 practice alone , i 've been horrified by dozens of botched jobs			0
one of my patients , a beautiful 25 - year - old woman , was left with shark bite - sized divots all over her thighs and stomach after undergoing laser liposuction by a family medicine doctor			0
a local @entity61 ( ear nose and throat ) physician took $ 12,000 from a young hairdresser for two unnecessary operations : insertion of watermelon - sized breast implants and liposuction to her abdomen			0
the implants were eventually removed , and the liposuction left her tummy a rippled , lumpy mess			0
why does this happen ? although state medical boards regulate who can obtain a license to practice medicine , they do n't restrict doctors from performing procedures outside of their training or specialty			1
once they are licensed , there is no law against doctors performing any medical procedure they want to , as long as the patient consents to it			1
as a board - certified plastic surgeon , i can legally perform a knee replacement or hysterectomy , procedures for which i am completely unqualified			1
this lack of regulation has allowed an increasing number of doctors of all types -- including gynecologists , general surgeons and even emergency medicine physicians -- to perform tummy tucks , liposuction , facelifts and breast enhancement			2
these procedures are almost never performed in real hospitals			0
hospitals typically vet their surgeons and allow them to practice only within their field of training and expertise			0
doctors get around this by performing cosmetic procedures in their own in - office operating rooms or at ambulatory surgery centers , where the credentialing requirements may not be as strict			1
so why do so many doctors reject their chosen specialty and remake themselves as plastic surgeons ? one word : money			1
declining physician reimbursement has resulted in more physicians looking for ways to enhance their income			2
and plastic surgery is one of the only fields of medicine that is shielded from insurance companies			1
so an increasing number of doctors are closing their traditional medical practices and opening cosmetic surgery centers			1
these physicians learn the basics of plastic surgery through weekend courses , shadowing other doctors and even online webinars			1
this influx of poorly trained cosmetic surgeons has caused @entity1 's story to become just one of many			0
if you are considering having plastic surgery , i implore you : do your homework			1
find a plastic surgeon who is certified by the @entity147 , the only plastic surgery board that is recognized by the @entity149			1
for facial plastic surgery , a doctor certified by the @entity151 is considered an equivalent in all states			1
i consider it a privilege that my patients put their lives and bodies in my hands			0
in return , we have a moral obligation to only perform procedures that we are fully qualified to do			0
no matter how well it pays			0

medical boards do n't restrict doctors from performing surgeries out of their specialty
many physicians are opening plastic surgery centers on the weekends to make money
find a plastic surgeon who is certified by the @entity147
