-- " let me be clear : i 'm proud to be gay , and i consider being gay among the greatest gifts @entity8 has given me , " @entity3 ceo @entity2 wrote in an essay published early thursday by @entity5			1
within hours , the announcement was headlining newspapers all over the world ( " @entity13 gay , " proclaimed @entity14 ) and trending on @entity15			0
@entity2 's news caps a year of achievements for the @entity19 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) community and its supporters : gay marriage is now legal in 32 states and the @entity25 ; the @entity26 drafted its first openly gay player ; and a trans woman graced the cover of @entity30 as the nation 's highest - paid female executive			1
even the @entity33 praised committed gay relationships			0
yet workplace discrimination and its ripple effects remain daunting hurdles for many @entity19 individuals			1
despite advances in workplace acceptance , over half ( 53 % ) of @entity19 workers remain closeted at the office , according to a 2014 @entity45 survey			1
while many companies excel at publicizing @entity49 policies and positions externally , there 's an ongoing need for company leaders to promote and act on them internally			1
after all , the enduring key to the success of @entity19 employees is organizations ' underlying cultures			1
research from the @entity59 shows that allies -- people who support @entity19 colleagues or work as advocates -- play a decisive role in creating an inclusive community where individuals are comfortable being themselves			1
@entity59 data finds that @entity19 employees are 1.2 times more likely to be out at companies where straight senior executives express their support publicly ( that 's 47 % versus 21 % )			1
in fact , 24 % of @entity19 workers surveyed attribute their decision to come out professionally to a strong network of allies			2
although the ally phenomenon is widespread and growing -- 70 % of men and 83 % of women consider themselves allies , according to the @entity59 survey -- far fewer people qualify as " active allies , " willing to openly support @entity19 colleagues in the workplace			2
employers have numerous opportunities to help strengthen " the ally effect " by creating networks that invite straight colleagues to support their @entity19 co-workers , by sponsoring @entity19 individuals and groups , participating in company events , or simply displaying some sort of ally identification in their workspace			2
openly gay senior executives being visibly out at work makes a difference as well			2
@entity19 employees are 85 % more likely to be out at companies where senior executives are out ( 24 % versus 13 % )			2
being able to be out has measurable benefits			0
earlier @entity59 research found that out lgbts are more satisfied with their rate of career advancement and more engaged at work ; conversely , closeted employees are 73 % more likely to say they plan to leave their companies within three years			0
@entity19 employees are n't the only beneficiaries of an inclusive workplace			1
with @entity19 buying power comprising $ 830 billion in the @entity117 alone , companies bolster their bottom line by building and sustaining connections to this large and expanding market			0
inclusive companies find that publicizing their support of @entity19 equality boosts their standing among consumers across the board : 71 % of @entity19 adults said they are likely to remain loyal to a brand they believe to be very friendly to the lgbt community even when less - friendly companies may offer lower prices or be more convenient			1
further , three - quarters of heterosexuals and 87 % of @entity106 said they would consider choosing a brand known to provide equal workplace benefits			0
@entity19 employees are crucial to reaching this market , as @entity59 's recent research on @entity139 reveals			2
companies that employ and leverage diverse talent , including employees with @entity19 smarts and an understanding of the @entity19 global market , better understand their end - users and produce novel solutions for diverse consumer -- if there are allies on the team who make that representative feel secure about raising ideas and sharing insights			0
the ultimate dividend : the combination of a diverse workforce and leaders who get that diversity makes companies measurably more innovative			0
employees are 75 % more likely to see their ideas implemented in the marketplace , according to the @entity59 study			0
in addition , firms are 70 % more likely than non-diverse publicly traded companies to capture new markets			0
@entity2 's announcement signals a fundamental -- and welcome -- shift in our attitudes toward @entity19 issues at work			1
still , as he points out in his essay , " ... there are laws on the books in a majority of states that allow employers to fire people based solely on their sexual orientation			0
there are many places where landlords can evict tenants for being gay , or where we can be barred from visiting sick partners and sharing in their legacies			0
countless people , particularly kids , face fear and abuse every day because of their sexual orientation			0
" in short , we ca n't declare victory until announcements like @entity2 's are not considered headline news .			1

@entity201 : @entity2 announced he 's gay , capping year of @entity19 achievements
she says workplace @entity19 discrimination persists . half remain closeted at work
she says company leaders must promote @entity19 friendly policies , company cultures
@entity201 : as @entity2 notes , many states do n't *protect* lgbt *rights* . we ca n't declare victory yet
