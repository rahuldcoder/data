-- @entity1 made big news in the education arena last month			1
superintendent @entity4 fired all the teachers at @entity6 after negotiations with the teachers ' union failed			1
the move was triggered by low test scores -- only 7 percent of 11th - graders passed the state math tests , and 50 percent of the students at @entity15 failed to graduate in four years			0
@entity4 wanted teachers to increase the length of the school day and spend time tutoring kids			1
the teachers ' union was not convinced			2
even president @entity23 got involved and supported the firing , saying , " if a school continues to fail its students year after year after year , if it does n't show signs of improvement , then there 's got to be a sense of accountability			1
" yes , accountability is right , but who is supposed to be accountable for this massive failure to learn ? the general consensus is that the teachers are responsible			2
is it really all the teachers ' fault ? columnist @entity40 thinks so			0
having been a teacher himself for five years , he says teachers just like to complain			1
he does n't say why he is no longer teaching , but he applauds the firing and blames the teachers			0
she fired all of them			0
everyone agrees that the k - 12 schools are failing , but the reasons are not as simple as @entity40 and @entity4 think			1
firing all the teachers is not the answer			1
closing schools is not the answer			1
schools are n't failing because the teachers do n't care or are n't trying			1
it 's not because teachers fail to follow the curriculum			1
it is n't because they are poorly paid			0
teachers go into teaching because they want to make a difference and help kids			0
they certainly do n't go into teaching to get rich			0
they do n't want to do a bad job , either ; no one likes to fail			0
a recent survey of 40,000 teachers by the @entity69 shows that teachers are more interested in reform than money			0
if you examine @entity6 closely , a few things stand out : more than 96 percent of the students are eligible for free or reduced lunch , according to the school 's web site , and only 6 percent of the people in the town have a college degree			1
does that tell you something important about the parents ? they are struggling financially and lack postsecondary education			0
@entity15 provides little or no parental support for students or for the teachers , yet everyone expects teachers to do it all with few resources			1
clearly , it does not work			0
in his book entitled " @entity97 ? the @entity98 , " @entity95 argues that the " home environment has strong effects on student achievement , stronger in fact than social class effects			0
" he argues that the most important home environment variables involve " parents expending time participating in activities with children that enhance learning			0
" very little , if any , of this is happening in the communities of a failing school			1
look at where the schools are failing -- in the most densely populated areas of the 50 largest @entity117 cities			1
low test scores and the dropout rate can not be blamed on the teachers alone			0
they need help from the parents , help from the community , help from the administrators , help from state and federal governments			1
thousands of kids starting kindergarten each year do n't know colors , counting , or even the names of fruits and vegetables			0
their vocabularies are hundreds of words fewer than their more advantaged peers			0
who is talking to these kids ? the electronic nanny -- the television			0
no teacher can effectively educate a child without support from the parents			1
support at the elementary level means spending time with their child , reading to their child , talking with their child , providing a stable home for their child			2
support in high school means a quiet place to study , recognition and approval for kids ' efforts , and helping when they are not doing well			2
strong schools have supportive parents and an involved community			2
schools like @entity6 have struggling communities			0
to fire all the teachers and blame them for the failure is to dismiss the important role that parents and communities play in the education of their children			1
imagine firing all the parents -- does that solve the problem ? what we have in communities with failing schools is parents who are for a variety of reasons -- mostly economic -- failing to parent effectively			1
the job of mothering is pass√©			0
let 's look at how ineffective school closures have been in @entity191 , where chancellor @entity192 has closed many schools			1
test scores are up , but scores dropped on the federal government 's broader measure of how local schools are doing in meeting the standards of the @entity200 law			2
or take a look at the @entity203 , where former ceo @entity204 , now @entity117 secretary of education , closed many schools			0
there 's been little change in scores because students are being transferred to other low - performing schools			1
it has n't worked because the community 's attitude and level of support has n't changed			2
a report released on march 1 by @entity217 shows that schools often lumped together as " low - performing " are not all alike			2
" examining data from reading and mathematics assessments for elementary and middle schools in ten states , the study 's authors found that some low - performing schools remain stuck year after year , and others that started low performing are among the fastest improvers in their states			1
" solving the problem requires individual solutions tailored to each school , not a blanket approach			2
the @entity117 @entity234 needs to change its focus and stop its policy of supporting the closing of failing schools ; it does not bring long - lasting change			2
@entity200 has had unintended negative consequences			0
instead , we as a nation need to support teachers in the classroom and stop using teachers as scapegoats in seeking to solve a major national problem			1
we need to work with teachers , not fire them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			2

@entity1 school *district* fired teachers at a failing school
teacher @entity250 says that 's not the answer to poorly performing schools
she says parents , administrators need to share blame , help solve problem
" no teacher can effectively educate a child without support from the parents , " she says
