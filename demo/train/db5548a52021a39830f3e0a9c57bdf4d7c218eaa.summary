-- @entity1 , the self - appointed " @entity2 " , was the man charged with winning the @entity3 and finally recognizing the dream of " @entity5			1
" instead , should he leave this summer , his epitaph will read " decimated "			2
just minutes after watching his @entity7 blow its chance of an unprecedented tenth triumph in @entity11 's elite competition tuesday , @entity1 was already busy plotting his escape route from the @entity14 capital following his fifth semifinal defeat in seven attempts			1
" i want to be where people love me to be , " he told @entity17 immediately after the game			2
just quite how much love there is in @entity7 for @entity1 is open for debate , but his side 's 2 - 0 victory was not enough to earn him the opportunity to become the first man to win the competition with three different clubs			1
last week 's humiliating 4 - 1 defeat in @entity31 left @entity7 with an uphill struggle and despite late goals from @entity34 and @entity35 , it failed to take advantage of the number of glorious chances which came its way			1
now , all eyes are on @entity1 , with former employers @entity41 just one of several high profile clubs likely to be interested in employing the @entity45 coach			2
but the 50 - year - old , who left @entity47 in september 2007 in acrimonious circumstances , insists he will wait until the end of the season before making a decision			2
real sits 11 points behind league leader and arch rival @entity54 in the title race , while it faces city neighbor @entity57 in the final of the @entity60 , the country 's top domestic cup competition			1
" i did n't make a decision because i have a contract and more than that , because in football people break contracts when they want to , is the respect i have for the club and the president , " he told a press conference			2
" it 's why i want to play the [ @entity60 ] final and win the cup and finish second in the league			2
i want to sit with my president , my friend , and decide the best for me			0
" last year 's league title win seems a long time ago now			0
@entity1 's reign has been tempestuous from the very moment he arrived in may 2010			0
style of play which has frustrated supporters , a falling out club captain @entity85 and a constant war of words with the @entity14 media has not helped his case			1
" i know in @entity91 i am loved by the fans , the media they treat me in a fair way , " he explained to reporters			0
" i know i am loved by some clubs , especially one			0
in @entity14 the situation is a bit different because some people hate me			1
" many of you are in this room			0
it 's difficult to make a decision because i like the club and we made a fantastic team that is ready to do big things			0
" i need to be honest and fair			0
at the end of the season i will speak			0
" @entity1 's mood may have been different had real profited from the number of opportunities gifted to it by a youthful and inexperienced @entity31 side			1
@entity116 's four - goal salvo in @entity117 last week had given the visiting side a cushion of comfort heading into the encounter			1
but manager @entity122 was left sweating on the touchlines as his players held on to amidst a barrage of pressure from the home side			2
" it is n't too hard to reveal what i thought during those last 10 minutes : if @entity132 wished it then we would qualify for the final , " he told a press conference			2
" but it has to be said that it was a crazy match , from start to finish			0
" trailing 4 - 1 from the first leg , @entity7 needed a fast start and it almost got one when @entity141 ran through on goal only to shoot straight at @entity31 keeper @entity143			1
@entity31 , which was forced into an early change following an injury to influential playmaker @entity146 , appeared nervous as @entity7 continued to pile on the pressure			1
those nerves should have been increased when @entity149 escaped the @entity31 defense , but fired his effort wide of the post with just the goalkeeper to beat			1
@entity154 was next to go close , this time sending a close range volley straight against @entity143 when he looked certain to score			0
with the home side consistently failing to take its chances , @entity31 began to grown in stature and @entity159 should have done better after meeting @entity161 's cutback			1
@entity31 , which drew 2 - 2 in @entity7 during the group stage of the competition , continued to create opportunities after the break and @entity116 fired over when well placed			1
the @entity167 striker should have given his side the lead on the night just minutes later when he burst clear of the @entity7 defense , but his thunderous effort cannoned against the crossbar and bounced down to safety			1
the @entity117 side then went close again when @entity176 's close - range effort forced @entity177 into a stunning save to keep the scores level			1
@entity1 threw on @entity179 and @entity34 to try and inspire @entity7 and the pair gave the home side a fresh impetus going forward			1
twice @entity183 went close before @entity7 finally made the breakthrough with eight minutes remaining			0
after watching @entity116 go close at the other end , the home side broke at pace and @entity34 swept the ball past @entity143 after connecting with @entity149 's pass			1
@entity34 then set up @entity35 six minutes later to leave @entity7 within touching distance , but that elusive goal just would n't come			1
" it 's a shame , " @entity35 told reporters			1
" sometimes you lose , that is football			0
" in @entity31 we should have played the way we did tonight			2
we feel for the fans			0
it 's a shame to have been so close but the missed chances in the first half were costly			0
" for @entity1 , the tie was lost on @entity117 soil a week ago , a result which condemned @entity7 to becoming the first team to suffer three consecutive semifinal defeats			2
he told @entity17 : " in football you win or you lose			0
i think we could have won			0
they had a couple of big chances but that was a consequence of the way we were playing late on where we risked everything			0
" today we were a team with character and desire and we could have done it			0
" i do n't forget the first match , we were very bad and we were punished because of the result of the first leg			0
" the prospect of an all - @entity117 final now looms large with @entity224 taking a 4 - 0 lead to the @entity226 to face @entity54 wednesday			1
but while @entity224 still has work to do , @entity31 can now relax in the knowledge they have booked a dream date with destiny , despite suffering a first defeat of the competition			1
" we knew if they scored a goal in the first half , the crowd would get euphoric and loud , " @entity233 told @entity17			0
" we had the game under control but with the goal the whole game changed - like the game against @entity242			2
" it 's unbelievable ; something everyone in the team dreamed of since being an child			0
some of us are still children			0
we are looking forward to @entity248			2

@entity31 is through to the @entity3 final at @entity248
@entity117 side beaten 2 - 0 on the night but go through 4 - 3 on aggregate
@entity34 and @entity35 were on target for @entity14 champions
@entity31 will face either @entity224 or @entity54 in its first final since 1997
