@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 admitted wednesday that the symbol of the neutral @entity6 organization was used in a hostage rescue mission that freed 15 people from leftist rebels two weeks ago			1
what seems to be part of a red cross is seen on a bib worn by a man involved in the rescue in this official image			1
@entity3 made the admission after @entity2 reported on unpublished photographs and videos that clearly showed a man wearing a @entity6 bib			1
wrongly using the @entity6 logo is prohibited by the @entity23			1
the man was a member of the @entity1 military intelligence team involved in the daring rescue , @entity3 said in an address carried on national tv and radio			1
the president said that as the constitutional head of the armed forces , he takes full political responsibility for what he described as a slip - up			2
" this officer , upon confessing his mistake to his superiors , said when the [ rescue ] helicopter was about to land ... he saw so many guerrillas that he went into a state of angst , " @entity3 said			1
" he feared for his life and put on the @entity6 bib over his jacket			1
" however , the confidential military source who showed @entity2 the photographs that included the man wearing the bib said they were taken moments before the mission took off			1
@entity3 said he was sorry for the mistake and has apologized to @entity56 officials			2
there will be no official sanction against the man wearing the bib , he indicated			1
such a use of the @entity6 emblem could constitute a " war crime " under the @entity23 and international humanitarian law and could endanger humanitarian workers in the future , according to international legal expert @entity66 , executive director of the @entity67			1
the @entity56 mission in @entity0 said in a written statement that it " noted " @entity3 's announcement			2
the @entity56 mission in @entity0 said in a written statement : " as guardian of international humanitarian law , the @entity56 reminds that the use of the @entity6 emblem is specifically regulated by the @entity23 and its additional protocols			1
" the @entity6 emblem has to be respected in all circumstances and can not be used in an abusive manner			2
" the @entity56 as neutral and impartial must have the confidence of all the sides in the conflict in order to carry out its humanitarian work			0
" @entity1 military intelligence used the @entity6 emblem in a rescue operation in which leftist guerrillas were duped into handing over 15 hostages , including former presidential candidate @entity87			1
photographs of the @entity1 military intelligence - led team that spearheaded the rescue , shown to @entity2 by a confidential military source , show one man wearing a bib with the @entity6 symbol			1
the military source said the three photos were taken moments before the mission took off to persuade the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) rebels to release the hostages to a supposed international aid group for transport to another rebel area			1
@entity66 said the conventions were " very strict " regarding use of the symbol because of what it represented : impartiality , neutrality			2
watch possible misuse of emblem » " if you use the emblem in a deceitful way , generally the conventions say it would be a breach			0
[ based on the information as explained to me , ] the way that the images show the @entity6 emblem being used could be distinguished as a war crime , " @entity66 added			1
the unpublished video and photos of the mission , hailed internationally as a daring success , were shown to @entity2 by a military source looking to sell the material			1
@entity2 declined to buy the material at the price being asked ; it was therefore unable to verify the authenticity of the images			0
@entity3 and his top generals had categorically denied that international humanitarian symbols were used in the july 2 rescue mission that freed the prized hostages			1
the hostages had endured years of harsh captivity and deprivation in jungle camps since being captured or kidnapped			0
some were held for as long as 10 years			0
the rescue ruse also included bogus communications , sent electronically and by human couriers , to convince @entity99 rebels that superiors were ordering them to hand over hostages to the group posing as aid workers for transfer to another rebel camp			0
misuse of the @entity6 emblem is governed by articles 37 , 38 and 85 of @entity154 to the @entity23 , the international rules of war			1
the articles prohibit " feigning of protected status by the use of ... emblems " of neutral parties and say that such misuses are considered breaches of international humanitarian law that qualify as a " war crime			0
" @entity1 signed the @entity23 in 1949			2
that prohibition was put in place to protect the neutrality of the @entity56 and the @entity171 in an armed conflict and to guarantee their access to all sides			0
use of those emblems by one side of a conflict , for example , could endanger aid workers because those on another side might no longer trust that symbols they see really represent those humanitarian organizations			0
among the photos shown to @entity2 are some bearing a date stamp of july 2 , taken at an unidentified landing site in the jungle alongside a farm house			0
in one of those photographs , about 15 members of a @entity1 military intelligence - led team pose for a photo alongside a helicopter			0
one of the members , dressed in a dark red t - shirt or polo shirt , khaki cargo pants and a black - and - white @entity202 - style scarf , also wears a bib of the type worn by @entity6 workers			1
the bib bears the @entity6 symbol in the center of two black circles on a white background			1
in the space between the two black circles appear in capital letters the @entity214 words " @entity215 " ( @entity216 )			0
the same man is standing in the doorway of the helicopter , a @entity218 - made @entity217 painted white and orange , in another photo			0
in a third photo , he is pictured walking near the helicopter still wearing the bib			2
the same man pictured in the photos can be seen fleetingly in a heavily edited video of the rescue mission issued to the media by the @entity231 two days after the hostages were freed			2
in one frame , part of what appears to be the @entity6 bib is visible as the man wearing it stands in a jungle clearing alongside guerrilla commanders @entity240 , @entity241 , and @entity242 , known as @entity243 , who were captured in the operation			1
the red blur of a @entity6 can be seen and part of the two black circles of the emblem and the capital letters " eve "			2
those are also the last three letters of word @entity252 ( @entity252 ) , which appears on the official @entity56 emblem and bib			0
in two other frames of the officially released video , the same man , dressed in the same clothes as in the pre-departure photos , can be seen still wearing the predominantly white bib tied at the sides			1
in those shots the @entity56 logo is not visible			0
the unpublished video also reveals an emblem that bears the @entity267 words " @entity268 " ( @entity269 ) and a stylized red bird made up of wavy red lines above two curved branches of blue leaves			0
in the 3½ - minute video of the operation issued by the military , emblems pasted on the side of the rescue helicopter can not be seen			2
but in the unpublished video and photos shown to @entity2 , emblems measuring about one square meter ( one square yard ) are pasted onto the outside of the chopper			0
the same emblem appears on the web site for @entity268 , which describes itself as a non-governmental organization based in @entity290 , @entity291 , that " works to improve the processes of development to guarantee equality of opportunity for individuals and peoples			0
" although the site says the group is registered with the @entity267 @entity301 and the regional @entity302 , the site is littered with misspellings , and the telephone number that 's listed is 000000000			0
@entity2 was unable to contact the group to verify its existence			0
the group 's web site could not be accessed early tuesday			0
additional video clips show how the emblems on the side of the helicopter were stripped off and burned once the rescue mission had been completed			2
the fate of the bib is not clear from the clips .			0
