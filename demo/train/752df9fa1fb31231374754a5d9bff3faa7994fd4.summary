@entity0 , @entity1 -- free @entity3 ! the world is upside down			0
the act of children bullying the vulnerable has become so common that many adults no longer seem to notice or care , much less do anything to stop it			1
but when a video clip on @entity12 shows a father defending his daughter from bullies , some people go ballistic			1
what used to be considered unacceptable is now thought to be normal , and what used to be normal is now unacceptable			0
@entity3 is facing two misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and disturbing a school function			1
he was released from jail after posting a $ 2,000 bond			0
it 's all because , three weeks ago , the 42 - year - old father from @entity25 , @entity26 , stormed onto a school bus and -- in a screed captured on video -- threatened the bus driver and some of the students with bodily harm			1
" now everybody sit down ; sit down , " @entity3 says on the tape			0
and then , addressing his daughter : " show me which one			1
" the girl points in the direction of a group of students , which @entity3 then approaches			0
he told them : " this is my daughter , and i will kill the [ expletive ] who fought her			1
" he also threatened the bus driver			1
but he was trying to do the right thing			0
he did n't board that bus to bully students as some have suggested			1
this is n't a story about a grown man terrorizing kids for the fun of it			1
he was there to defend and protect his 13 - year - old daughter , who had been terrorized by real bullies who -- according to what @entity3 told deputies -- teased his daughter , spat on her , poked her , pushed her , smacked her on the back of her head , twisted her ear and shouted rude comments at her			1
they even threw a liquid - filled condom at another girl , and fragments hit @entity3 ' daughter			1
according to the sheriff 's report , this abuse eventually drove the girl , who has cerebral palsy , to have an emotional breakdown and threaten suicide			0
meanwhile , the officials at @entity81 have taken a break from @entity83 and @entity84 to do a little @entity85			0
school spokeswoman @entity86 told @entity87 in an e-mail that @entity3 did not share with school administrators any concerns about his daughter being bullied			1
@entity3 ' wife , @entity92 , told the @entity87 that she left messages with a school guidance counselor but that she never heard back			0
as the father told @entity96 , co-host of @entity2 's " @entity97 , " when he learned of the abuse , he acted on instinct			0
" she finally opened up and told me what was going on , " @entity3 said			0
" and from there , you know , being a dad just loving my daughter ... and just loving all my kids , you know			1
... [ at ] that point , my heart broke when i [ saw ] her standing there ... [ she ] was n't going to get on the bus crying			2
and a dad is a dad			2
and i was going to be her protector that day			0
" that 's what this was : a father protecting his daughter			2
and if that little girl could n't rely on her dad to protect her , just whom in this world is she supposed to rely on ? at an emotional news conference this week , @entity3 acknowledged that his behavior was wrong and apologized for it			2
" if you see the tape , " he said , " i feel like i was backed up against the wall as a parent			0
i just did n't know where else to go			0
" yet , @entity3 said , parents should not follow his example			2
" we definitely do n't want to promote that , " he said			0
" we do n't want vigilantes going on buses , threatening kids , because kids have rights too			1
" oh yeah , as @entity144 , we have rights			2
we know all about our rights			2
we do n't think twice about hiring lawyers to defend our rights			2
but what we have trouble with is the other half of the social contract : responsibility			0
that includes the responsibility to treat one another with dignity and respect , and not prey on those who ca n't defend themselves			0
and the responsibility of parents to raise good kids who do n't get their jollies from causing classmates mental and emotional anguish			1
and the responsibility of school officials to take seriously the idea that they act in loco parentis ( in place of parents ) and that our children 's safety rests in their hands			2
@entity3 ' attorney has said she is hoping to get the charges against him dropped			1
she has even offered to have her client give speeches against bullying as a form of community service			0
the attorney is half right			0
the charges in this case should be dropped -- immediately			1
and i 'd like to see charges filed against the teenage bullies			2
in an ideal world , we 'd also charge their parents for bungling the job of raising these kids			1
but @entity3 should n't waste his time giving speeches about bullying			0
instead , he should lecture audiences about something that is really important to our society and that a lot of people do n't know how to do but that he seems pretty good at : parenting			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			1

@entity203 : @entity12 video shows dad yelling at kids who bullied his daughter on bus
@entity211 when dad arrested for doing what adults there should have done , he says
@entity218 *regrets* actions ; says kids have rights too . *writer* : other adults had responsibilities
@entity203 : charges should be dropped , dad should lecture *lax* parents about parenting
