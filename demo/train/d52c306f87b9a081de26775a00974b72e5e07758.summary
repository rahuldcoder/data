-- @entity1 might be a 65 - year - old woman living in @entity2 , but for four hours each day she is transformed into the legendary @entity4 painter , @entity3			1
you would n't know it to look at her -- a former physics teacher with mousey brown hair and a cheeky gap - toothed smile			2
but over the last few months @entity1 has come to know @entity3 intimately , recreating his every brush stroke , his every color choice			2
" i live with him , " she says			0
" @entity1 is a copyist			0
and if you wander around the grand rooms of @entity2 ' @entity17 gallery , you 'll see dozens of people just like her with their easels pitched in front of a masterpiece , paintbrush at the ready			1
curious children scamper up to them , doing a double - take between the painting on the wall and the version being created before their eyes : " what are you doing ? " they ask			0
the copyists are recreating some of the most famous paintings in the world , in a remarkable tradition dating back to when the museum first opened in 1793			1
@entity39 tradition it 's a tradition that continues today -- albeit it , in a far more regimented fashion			1
just 150 copyists are allowed in the @entity17 , with a one - year waiting list for the privilege			1
each canvas is signed , dated , and stamped three times before even a drop of paint hits it			0
and even then , it must not be the same size as the original or include the artist 's signature			1
five - days - a - week , from 9.30am to 1.30pm , copyists stream into the most popular museum on the planet , using one of the easels and stools provided			2
there is one easel however , which never leaves the office -- the very same one renowned post-impressionist painter @entity64 used 150 years ago			1
mastering the masters indeed , @entity64 , who would often copy the great masters , once famously said : " the @entity17 is the book from which we learn to read			1
" he was n't alone			0
@entity71 also painted a fantastical version of @entity75 's " women of @entity74			1
" " that bastard , " @entity71 reportedly said of @entity75			1
" he 's really good ! " so why do these artists -- ranging from professionals painters , to students , and retirees -- spend painstaking hours perfecting what has arguably already been perfected ? " you spend so much time in front of this painting , that little by little you understand what 's in it -- how he did it , the people in it , the historical context , " explained @entity1 , who has completed five paintings from the @entity17 , over four years			1
" you find the right brush , the right colors , the right movement in your hand			0
you feel very close to them			0
" curious copyists of course , not everyone saw copyists in quite the same light			2
" poor ridiculous folk , picking up the crumbs and alms of art at the feet of the @entity108 , " said the @entity102 in 1887			0
today , many museum visitors appear baffled or intrigued to see the artists quietly working among the crowds , and children will often be the first to poke their head in			1
" the children , they ca n't believe it , " said @entity1 , who sometimes gives the youngsters a paint brush of their own			0
" if you go into a museum and see paintings on the wall , you think you will never be able to do it			0
i say : ' but you can			0
' " anyway , we are doing copies , we are not trying to say it 's a new @entity129 , " she added			2
it 's a date ? but the @entity17 is n't just a giant studio for these artists -- it 's also a potential meeting place for single copyists			1
or at least , that 's how 19th century @entity138 art critic and novelist @entity137 -- otherwise known as @entity142 § ois - @entity141 © lix @entity140 -- reportedly saw it			2
" copy a painting next to hers , then ask to borrow some cadmium or cobalt			0
then correct the odious mess of colors she calls a painting ( they 're always glad to get advice ) and talk about the @entity154 until the @entity17 closes and you have to continue the conversation in the street			1
improvise the rest , " was supposedly his advice for meeting like - minded ladies			0
for @entity1 , love at the @entity17 comes in a very different form -- her own paintings			1
the last picture she completed , a one - mete - tall copy of @entity167 's 16th century " @entity168 , " now sits proudly in her house			2
in fact , she ca n't bear to be apart from it			0
" i love this painting so much , i put it in the room where i am , " she says			0
does that include moving it to her bedroom at night ? " yes ! " she says .			0
