-- if you look at the images of destruction from @entity5 , it 's not hard to see why officials have called the @entity7 the most destructive in state history			2
last week , it was like a monster roaring down a mountainside , swallowing houses whole			2
and that 's not even the biggest blaze at the moment			2
a fire in @entity18 's @entity17 is raging over 186,800 acres			1
as many as 13 new large fires were reported sunday , the @entity19 said			2
in all , 14 states , mostly in the @entity22 , are dealing with active fires			1
does it seem like wildfires in the @entity26 are getting bigger and badder ? it 's a question fire expert @entity28 has been hearing a lot lately			1
that 's because the @entity33 , @entity32 professor published a report on global fire risks on june 12 , just before the massive fires in @entity5 ignited			1
" in the long run , we found what most fear -- increasing fire activity across large parts of the planet , " he said			1
@entity28 's study concluded that some areas of the world , including the western @entity26 , " should brace themselves for more fire			1
" 4 die fighting @entity49 fire nationally , wildfires have scorched about 2.2 million acres this year			1
that 's less than half the number in july of last year			2
but the gap has been closing rapidly over the last few days , said @entity54 , spokesman for the @entity19			2
he said the @entity26 was on pace to match or go beyond last year 's acreage			0
in some parts of the country , like @entity5 , this year is far worse			0
" certainly for a number of people in communities , 2012 is a terrible year , " @entity54 said			0
" i do n't want to take anything away from that			0
" weather conditions played a big role , @entity54 said			1
snowfall was below average in many @entity49 states and dry conditions helped fuel this year 's fires			1
" the winter of 2011 - 2012 really dealt the cards , " @entity54 said			1
the frequency and length of the fire season for forest fires has increased substantially due to higher temperatures and earlier spring snowmelt , found a 2009 report by the @entity80			1
" these changes in climate have reduced the availability of moisture , drying out the vegetation that provides the fuel for fires , " the report said			0
climate changes have also contributed to major insect outbreaks , the report said ,			0
about 1.5 million acres in @entity5 have been infested by pine beetles , which kill trees and make them fodder for fire			1
" i imagine that this is just the opening salvos of what we 're going to see this summer , especially if the temperatures stay up , " said @entity96 , who writes a newsletter of wildfire news			0
@entity28 listed several factors in what makes wildfires wilder			1
how fast is the fuel for the fire growing ? how flammable can that fuel get ? what is going to ignite the fire ? while weather is a key contributor , there 's debate over whether @entity49 states are victims of climate change			1
@entity28 said the record temperatures and lack of humidity are characteristics of climate change -- hallmarks of what weather models predict we should expect under climate change			1
record heat , storms bring despair , ' horror ' " but to say it is climate change ? i think most of us are cautious about saying that , " he said			0
some experts blame bad forest management			0
others like @entity141 say firefighting resources are inadequate			0
still others say people are affected due to building in fire - prone areas			1
@entity28 says it 's probably all of the above			0
the problem is just complex enough , he said , to lead to misinterpretations			0
he said the conversation should focus instead on how people can better coexist with fire as they do with other hazards			2
@entity26 build in extra precautions for houses in flood plains or on earthquake faults ; why not do the same for houses in fire - prone areas , @entity28 said			1
" this is a really big wake - up call , a very big warning in all the losses we are seeing , " @entity28 said of this year 's fires			1
that warning was particularly stern tuesday as millions of @entity26 prepared for the @entity164			0
for many in western states , the fires will force different sorts of celebrations			2
" everybody is kind of worried , " @entity96 said			0
" they 've seen 32,000 people evacuated			0
you 're going to see a lot of nervous people in the @entity22			0
" no grilling or sparklers			0
and no fireworks bursting in air			0
as temperatures sizzle , fireworks are even more risky triple - digit strategies for staying healthy more than 1.2 million customers lack power amid unrelenting heat			2

a recent study finds increasing fire activities across the planet
fire - *plagued* @entity49 states should brace for more in the *future* , the study says
weather is a big factor , though a *combination* of factors can also be cited
building in fire - prone areas should be an exercise in caution , one expert says
