-- a @entity2 militia leader and his son pleaded guilty thursday to federal gun charges two days after a federal judge in @entity6 dropped the more serious charges of sedition and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against the government			1
@entity15 , 47 , and his son @entity16 , 23 , members of the @entity14 , face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 250,000 after admitting to possessing illegal automatic firearms			1
both have already spent two years in prison			1
" we are gratified that these felony convictions mean that these defendants will never be permitted to possess firearms again , " said @entity23 attorney @entity22			1
federal authorities accused nine members of the " @entity31 warrior " militia of homegrown terrorism			2
the @entity32 planted a secret informant and @entity32 agent in the militia in 2008 to record the activities of the group			0
the video and audio recordings became the crux of the federal case , including clips of the elder @entity16 making anti-government statements and remarks about killing police officers			1
but in a trial that began in early february , federal district judge @entity46 said she did not find that the government 's evidence sufficiently proved that the @entity51 militia had planned a conspiracy against the government			2
" the court 's order dismissing the more serious charges in this case was disappointing , but it does not shake our commitment to dismantling groups who would harm our citizens and law enforcement officers , and these efforts will continue , " @entity22 said			2
the move cleared several of the original nine defendants of all charges			2
the @entity80 " admitted that they possessed machine guns , specifically a bushmaster .223 caliber rifle and a @entity74 .223 caliber rifle respectively , knowing that the firearms would shoot , and were designed to shoot , automatically more than one shot , without manual reloading , by a single function of the trigger , " the @entity23 attorney 's office said			1
@entity46 , in her 28 - page ruling dismissing the more serious charges , said the " government 's case is built largely of circumstantial evidence			0
" " while this evidence could certainly lead a rational fact finder to conclude that ' something fishy ' was going on , it does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants reached a concrete agreement to forcibly oppose the @entity23 government , " @entity46 said			0
" pick a sentence here , pick a sentence there -- the ( remarks were ) taken out of context , " a defense attorney for one of the cleared militia members said			0
" we always said it was a @entity105 and @entity106 case , and that 's what it ended up being , " added attorney @entity101 , whose client , @entity102 , is the wife of the elder @entity16			1
the @entity51 militia members cleared of all charges are @entity102 , 46 ; @entity113 , 22 , another son of the elder @entity16 ; @entity114 , 48 ; @entity115 , 40 ; and @entity116 , 29			1
defendant @entity51 , 30 , awaits his sentence after pleading guilty to a weapons charge in december			0
another defendant , @entity119 , 35 , will be tried separately			0
" i did n't figure we were doing anything wrong -- in the lines of going out there and doing the trainings -- to me it was basically fun , " @entity102 said wednesday			0
" i 'm worried for my husband and son			0
i guess i will be able to live my life a little easier once they 're home			0

@entity15 , and his son @entity16 face up to 10 years in prison for gun charges
the judge dropped more serious charges against the @entity14 members
" we are gratified " the @entity80 will never possess guns again , the *prosecutor* says
