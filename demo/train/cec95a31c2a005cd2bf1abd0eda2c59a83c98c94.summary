the @entity1 - led @entity0 passed legislation friday , voting 252 - 161 , approving construction of the @entity5 pipeline , which would take that decision away from the @entity7			1

@entity15 has also been pushing for approval of the pipeline , and the @entity11 is expected to vote on the measure tuesday			1
the bill will need 60 votes to pass and it 's expected to be a close vote			2
the long - stalled measure got a jump start when @entity15 -- the @entity29 chairwoman facing an uphill re-election battle -- saw it as one last chance to demonstrate her clout and began pushing for an immediate vote			0
@entity34 who had previously ignored the bill are now moving toward giving it a vote in the lame duck session , knowing that @entity1 are likely to force the issue after their newly - elected majority is sworn into office in january			2
republicans sought to mute @entity15 's chances of getting a political boost in her oil - rich state by promising @entity12 a spot on the energy panel , and also having him sponsor the @entity0 's legislation to authorize the pipeline			1

a @entity57 spokeswoman said the votes will have no effect on the department 's consideration of the pipeline , and that the review is continuing			0
@entity15 , meanwhile , has insisted that the @entity11 has at least 60 votes to approve the pipeline -- and is taking credit for the legislation 's sudden movement			2
