-- a week of critical diplomacy is set to begin in @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4			0
but the sides are so far apart , at least in public declarations , it is impossible to predict where any diplomatic efforts will lead			0
@entity10 continues to hold fast to the position that its nuclear and ballistic missile programs are non-negotiable			1
@entity4 's official news agency says the @entity10 wants @entity16 sanctions lifted			2
the sanctions were put in place after @entity10 launched a three - stage rocket last december that put a satellite in orbit			2
more sanctions were added when the @entity23 conducted its third underground nuclear test in february			0
the @entity25 and @entity26 insist that a verifiable path to dismantling those programs must be on the table for any negotiating process to begin			1
@entity26 are increasingly saying they may need a nuclear deterrent to counter @entity4 's threats			1
@entity34 , of course , detests the possibility the @entity25 would reintroduce strategic nuclear weapons there			1
( they were removed in 1991			0
) everyone is heaping pressure on @entity34 to rein in the @entity10			1
looking at the @entity10 's rapidly growing nuclear threat , some @entity26 admit that after years of dismissing all the bombastic rhetoric from @entity4 , real fears are emerging			1
" it really is a game changer , " said @entity44 , president of the @entity45 in @entity46			0
" we really do n't know what to do with it because these are political weapons , these are psychological weapons			0
" @entity10 outlines exacting terms for talks with @entity25 , @entity26 wanted : bold diplomatic moves ( by the other guy ) @entity44 says the six - party talks do n't evoke confidence anymore			1
in his view , what is needed is a bold , new strategy comparable to president @entity63 's historic 1972 visit to @entity3 credited with not only laying the groundwork for rapprochement with the @entity25 , but opening up @entity34 to the world			1
@entity10 leader @entity67 is no @entity68			1
but @entity3 may be hoping @entity2 will overlook that			0
" the @entity34 are very keen to just get back to any kind of talks , " @entity70 told @entity0			2
the @entity75 's @entity74 project director says more than one @entity34 source has suggested a repeat of the @entity79 scenario			2
" the @entity34 regularly tell me , if ( president ) @entity80 would just pick up the phone and talk to @entity67 , we could solve this whole thing ! " do n't hold your breath			2
@entity80 is in lockstep with his regional allies vowing not to reward @entity4 's bad behavior			0
@entity34 is feeling more wanted than ever			0
the @entity10 have signaled their readiness to meet with anyone from @entity3			0
the @entity25 , @entity91 and @entity26 have repeatedly and publicly declared that @entity34 holds the key to reining in the @entity10			1
while @entity3 raised its hand in the vote in favor of sanctions on @entity4 , many believe it is staying that hand when it comes to enforcing them			0
" if @entity34 is not active and @entity34 is not fully committed , i do n't think this is an issue that can be resolved , " says professor @entity101 of @entity46 's @entity102			2
@entity34 has shown disdain for @entity67 's recent outbursts			1
but @entity3 's no. 1 priority is keeping his regime from collapse and millions of hungry @entity10 on his side of the border			1
@entity34 is arguably sympathetic to young @entity67 's predicament			1
that 's the reason , says @entity113 and others , that @entity34 will not go as far as the @entity25 and its partners in @entity74 would like			1
nuclear weapons : who has what ? understanding @entity67 's predicament " we think they 're blackmailing us right now , we think they want money from us , " said @entity120 , a professor of @entity122 studies at @entity102 in @entity46			1
" what we fail to understand is their profound insecurity			0
" @entity120 recalled the six - party talks , when @entity25 diplomats were trying to persuade the @entity10 to denuclearize			2
" we said , look , you 'll be safe without your nuclear weapons , look at @entity134 ! " while almost no one inside @entity10 has access to the real @entity137 , we can safely assume that @entity67 is the exception			1
we should also assume that the young leader has watched the grisly videos of @entity141 being lynched by a mob of his own people			0
@entity67 may see his own face in that video			0
" there 's growing public sentiment , " says @entity101 , that " we have to be very firm with this regime			0
it 's good to have dialogue and , yes , we want to talk with @entity10			2
but it 's a fading hope that somehow we could convince @entity10 , through dialogue , to give up its nuclear weapons program			1
" if that 's the case , what 's the point in engaging in dialogue ? should n't we now be focusing on beefing up our security so our deterrence , especially nuclear deterrence , is firm so we will not be vulnerable to these threats ? " diplomacy to deal with @entity10 is gathering momentum			2
but the vast difference in the positions of all the parties raises doubts about the outcome			0
if it fails , many predict @entity4 will immediately subscribe to another round of missile or nuclear tests and the familiar , and destabilizing , sequence will begin anew			0
war of words : timeline of a crisis			0

@entity10 says its nuclear and ballistic missile programs are non-negotiable
the @entity25 and @entity26 say a way to dismantle those programs must be on the table
@entity26 may want nuclear weapons of their own , an idea that *rankles* @entity34
@entity34 's top priority is keeping @entity67 's regime from collapse
