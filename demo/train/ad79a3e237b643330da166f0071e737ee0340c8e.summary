@entity0 -- @entity4 immigration officials have decided that an undocumented immigrant college student apprehended by authorities after driving without a license can stay in the @entity4 for another year , the student said			1
reached by phone as she rushed to class tuesday evening , @entity9 student @entity8 said the decision was " like a big present			1
" a spokeswoman for @entity15 , @entity16 , issued a statement saying the agency " uses discretion on a case - by - case basis , as appropriate , and has the authority to grant a deferral of removal based on the merits of an individual 's case and a review of specific facts			0
" she would not elaborate on the merits of @entity8 's case			1
@entity8 's immigration attorney , @entity31 , said his client was facing a deportation deadline later this week			1
on friday , he filed a petition with @entity15 for an extension to stop the removal order , arguing that @entity8 's graduation was days away , and asking for time to allow her to put her personal affairs in order			1
the petition also cited similar cases across the @entity4 in which the deportations of undocumented students were being deferred			0
@entity31 said the extension was granted tuesday , and it allows @entity8 to apply for a work permit for the duration of the extension			1
@entity8 , who is scheduled to graduate next week with a degree in political science , became a lightning rod in the immigration debate last spring			1
activists on both sides of the issue said her case was a symbol of a broken system			1
her legal problems started in march 2010 , when police stopped her car on the @entity9 campus , saying she had been obstructing the flow of traffic in a university parking lot			2
born in @entity65 but living in the @entity4 since she was 11 , @entity8 could not produce a driver 's license , so she handed over as identification an expired passport from @entity65			1
she was arrested the next day and turned over to immigration officials			2
the young woman spent more than a month in the @entity71 in @entity72			0
friends came out in force and marched on campus in @entity8 's defense , and the university president spoke in support			2
in may , she was released and her deportation was deferred for a year to allow her to finish her studies			2
but she was quickly arrested on a warrant from the @entity82 and released on $ 2,500 bail			0
@entity82 participates in a federal program that allows jail officials to initiate deportation procedures for inmates believed to be in the country illegally			0
" i 'm just trying to live the @entity4 dream and finish my education , " she said at the time			0
@entity31 said despite the reprieve , the chances that @entity8 will be able to remain in the country are still slim			0
he said it will be much harder to get a third extension next year			0
she could also be barred from re-entering the @entity4 for up to 20 years if she is deported			0
@entity1 's @entity96 and @entity97 contributed to this report .			0
