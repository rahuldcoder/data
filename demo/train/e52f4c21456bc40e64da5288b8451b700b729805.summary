-- in @entity3 's latest film , " @entity7 , " he tells the tale of two young lovers who reunite and run away into the wilderness after a year apart			1
it 's 1965 , and a major storm is bearing down on @entity10 , off the coast of @entity12 , and their disappearance sets off an island - wide search and rescue mission			1
the film stars @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 along with @entity3 favorite @entity22 and @entity23			1
but it 's the two young lovers , portrayed by newcomers @entity26 and @entity28 , who steal the show			1
" @entity7 , " which opens in @entity36 and @entity37 on friday , has the look and tone of @entity3 's prior films " @entity33 , " " the @entity34 " and " @entity35			1
" but here , @entity3 is examining the notion that love is a driving force that causes a range of different reactions -- especially when those at the center are just 12			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity3 from @entity45 , @entity46 , about the making of " @entity7 , " the film 's lack of nostalgic impulses and the impulse for audiences to read deeper into on - screen metaphors			1
@entity0 : the word " twee " is often used by people these days to describe your work			2
does that word mean anything to you ? @entity3 : virtually nothing			1
( laughs ) i get the thrust of it , but it 's really kind of like white noise to me			1
i have no opinion about it @entity0 : " @entity7 " tells the story of two 12 - year - olds who fall in love and run away			1
is this a universal feeling of youth ? @entity3 : my point of view about it was the memory of feeling that way is so strong for me			1
rather than starting with an idea of a character or characters and a setting , instead i was starting out with a feeling			2
a memory of an emotion that i was hoping to re-create in some way			2
so , that 's where it came from			1
@entity0 : is it wrapped around nostalgia ? @entity3 : even though there 's every reason to think its nostalgic : it 's set in the ' 60s , and it 's childhood and first love and that sort of thing			1
but i do n't really associate it with nostalgia			2
somebody in @entity102 asked me , " is it your memory of a fantasy ? " it took me a second , to think , " i do n't even know what you mean			2
" but i see that is exactly what it is			2
this fantasy i had at that time			2
@entity0 : over the years , your films paint these pictures of various male figures that struggle in some way to grow up or face reality			2
what 's interesting about that for you ? @entity3 : i kinda think probably the adult and the children -- at least in this new story -- are on parallel tracks			1
they 're not going the same direction , but they 're all having these romantic relationships that they 're trying to find a way to make work and rescue themselves through them			2
the kids are the ones that have a clarity about what they want			2
they do n't have any wisdom , but they do have a clear understanding about what they want to have happen			1
and the adults do n't			2
it ends up making them more confused than the kids			2
@entity0 : that clarity , the directness , is intriguing about the worlds and characters that you portray			0
you do n't do macho , " i do n't care " guys			0
they know what they want and get a little bit psycho for the girl			0
@entity3 : ( laughs ) you 're right			1
you could say they get a little psycho for the girl , and you could put this on any of the guys			0
i 'm sure you could track that back over a number of different films			0
i do n't know how it relates to real life			0
the psychological indication it makes about myself			0
but it does seem to be a continuing thread			0
@entity0 : " @entity7 " is the two young actors ' first roles in anything			1
what was the logic behind this casting ? @entity3 : when you 're going to cast people this age , you 're assuming that they 're not going to be professional			1
even if they are , it just means they 've been working for eight months or something like that			0
i had no preconception about what they were supposed to look like , sound like or act like			0
i knew what the characters were like and that they had to sort of relate to that			0
they 're sort of outsiders			0
they 've got to be convincing in that			0
but we started really early in the casting process and set aside a long time to do it			0
just looked at one audition after another , waiting for someone to appear that we all felt like we could shut down and move on to the next phase of production			0
@entity0 : how much does the setting in " @entity7 " factor into this story ? @entity3 : i feel like i want the movie to happen in a place where the audience has never been before			1
that 's sort of a slightly magical world			1
i started feeling like the movie ought to feel like -- the girl is carrying around a suitcase full of fantasy books -- somewhere along the way , i started to feel like the movie should feel like it could be in that suitcase			1
that it could be one of those books			0
so everything that goes into the movie -- where we shot it , the locations , the houses , the sets -- are all my way of make this world that 's not a familiar reality			1
@entity0 : during the film , there 's the idea that a major rainstorm is bearing down on the island			1
should i read into that as a metaphor about what 's brewing between everyone on screen ? @entity3 : i 'm up for reading into it			1
i like to hear people reading into it			0
i tend to try to keep it very abstract from myself			0
i like to put things and work things in to these stories that feel like symbols to me			0
but i do n't really want to know what they symbolize			0
i 'd rather have someone say , " i got this out of it			0
" i want to feel like i 'm working with some subconscious stuff that could be stronger because we do n't simplify it too much			0
let it be open to different connections			0
i 'm sorry i 'm sounding a little cosmic about it			0
the storm should feel like it 's about a lot of things			1
now i 'm going to try one : it could even have to do with what 's coming in @entity275 or something like that			1
1965 is sort of an end to a period			0
i 'm just trying this out , though			0
that 's my first time to have that thought .			2
