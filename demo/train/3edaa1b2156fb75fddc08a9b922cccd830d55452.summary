i 'm relaxing at home on the couch watching tv , and everything seems to be about the @entity5			1
i ca n't seem to avoid the constant reminder of where i would like to have been at this moment : in @entity8 , @entity9			1
i change the channel to @entity12 hockey , and now i am confronted with the images of guys who i grew up with and played against , skating with the pros ! how much can one athlete endure ? well , i can tell you from a personal standpoint , it 's quite a lot			1
@entity24 scans , mris , hours in physical therapy , pool exercises while wearing a hard plastic torso brace that i took off only to shower , z - joint injections and plenty of non-steroidals were my life for my year spent off the ice			1
sometimes i questioned myself : was it really worth it ? absolutely ! i have always wanted to be the best , and it drives me every day , no matter the obstacle			2
i had dreamed of playing in the @entity12 until bilateral fractures of @entity36 ( one of the lumbar vertebrae in the lower back ) derailed that quest			1
my teammates , friends and family were very supportive , and my desire to return to the ice was unquestioned			1
however , the possibility of recurrent injury and perhaps never walking pain - free again steered me in the direction of figure skating			1
' do n't put limits on your dreams ' in retrospect , what was i thinking ? quadruple jumps , triple axels ... hockey might have been a less injurious endeavor			1
the long days of multiple repetitions , weights and stretching with the physical therapists reinforced a mental strength that i had developed over years of elite competition			2
nothing was going to stand in my way of returning to the ice			1
i hope that my work ethic has been a model for those who do not believe in themselves or have lingering doubts about their own abilities			2
nothing makes you try harder than to be told that you are not good enough or that you simply do not have the skills			2
fast - forward to the the @entity78 @entity77 in @entity79 , @entity80			2
i trained with a single focus : to medal in my first senior competition			2
however , i let my my nerves get to me , and i finished eighth			2
a few months of soul - searching and some encouragement from my mom and dad put me back in the game			1
anyone who thinks i ca n't does n't really know @entity91			1
if i 'm not sweating , then i 'm not working			2
surround yourself with positive people			2
all the things that i learned from playing hockey could be translated to competing in figure skating			1
happily , i did n't have to spend time in the box ! @entity100 , @entity101 , january 2013 : the @entity102			1
a couple of silly errors in the short program left me within striking distance , exactly where i wanted to be going into the long program			2
time to drop the gloves			0
i did n't want my long program to end			1
it felt better than a hat trick , and i won			0
being the champion comes with expectations and new pressures			0
going to the @entity117 as a senior international debut ! no problem			1
my coaches reminded me to stick with the process that had gotten me to that point			0
heading into the fall of 2013 , i was feeling confident but knew that sometimes you need even more than hard work			0
we created a challenging long program for the @entity5 season with three quadruple jumps			0
olympian transplant survivor : ' enjoy the ride ' i still believe that it was a great strategy , but maybe not in an @entity5 season			0
at the end of the day , i 've always learned from my experiences			0
i skated clean in practice numerous times			0
in competition , i struggled a bit			0
going into the @entity78 trials , i decided to stick with jump passes that were more familiar to me			0
i took a slightly less risky program into @entity142 for the @entity143			0
the short program was respectable , not my best			0
for the long , " just do what you did last year , " i told myself			0
but a couple of minor errors left the door open , and terrific skates from others left me at the doorstep of another dream			0
time to turn the page again			0
the fire within burns until i alone extinguish that flame			0
do n't take no for an answer			1
it is these truths that i hope i can inspire others with , whether in athletics or just people facing adversity in life of any kind			0
fyi , i turned the channel back to the @entity5 after watching some great hockey that cold winter 's day			1
watching the figure skating that day threw fuel on my fire to work toward the @entity117 in @entity176 and competitions beyond			1
please come along for the ride .			0
