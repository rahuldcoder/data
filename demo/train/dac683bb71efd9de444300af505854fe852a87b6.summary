@entity0 -- former congresswoman @entity2 is urging @entity4 voters to supporter her successor , rep. @entity6 , who is locked in a tough race for re-election , with a personal video appeal			1
@entity2 , who has been recovering since being seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting , speaks clearly into the camera as she says , " we expect our leaders to fight for us , not the special interests			1
@entity6 is independent , he 's courageous , and most of all he 's @entity4 through and through			1
" this ad from the political action committee founded by @entity2 -- @entity17 -- follows some controversy about a previous ad from the same group attacking @entity6 's opponent , @entity22 @entity21			1
5 @entity24 races to watch in 2014 @entity6 is a former congressional aide to @entity2			1
they were both wounded in that same attack as she was greeting constituents			0
he won a special election to replace her after she resigned her seat in 2012 and then he was re-elected to a full term in 2012			0
the campaign for @entity4 's 2nd @entity35 this year again pits @entity6 against @entity36 , a retired @entity38 colonel			1
he barely beat her two years ago , and the 2014 race is rated a tossup by the nonpartisan @entity43 and @entity44 political reports			0
this is the fourth ad in this contest from @entity17 , which @entity2 and her husband @entity47 formed to help push for stronger gun - control legislation , including more stringent background checks for purchases			1
several of the group 's previous spots went after @entity21 for not supporting closing a gap that allowed stalkers with misdemeanor convictions to buy guns but barring those convicted of felonies from such purposes			2
one of those spots became controversial for featuring a mother whose 19 - year - old daughter was stalked and shot to death by her ex-boyfriend			0
in the wake of the ad , her campaign later said @entity21 would support new legislation preventing those convicted of a misdemeanor stalking crime from buying a gun and revealed she had been a victim of stalking earlier			2
guns killing women : time for @entity78 to act the ad and the topic of how to deal with gun violence were featured in a debate between @entity21 and @entity6 on tuesday			1
@entity21 said she was a proud supporter of the @entity83 , adding she wanted to make sure gun violence was minimized and " is obviously addressed in our communities			2
" then she added : " we have different ways of talking about that			0
but the way that this has happened in this campaign has just been disgraceful			0
there were ads that were run by your allies that were considered vile and nasty by the @entity97 ( newspaper )			0
" @entity21 pushed @entity6 over the stalking ad			1
he responded , " the ad was not run by me , and i 'm not going to talk about an ad that i did n't sponsor			0
but when you talk about allies , the ad was run by someone who is highly regarded in this community and across the country for her work to prevent gun violence and that 's @entity2			1
but that aside , what my opponent has said is that she now accepts the notion that we should have misdemeanor stalkers prohibited from having a gun			0
the problem with her position is that she still refuses to say we should expand background checks			0
" @entity17 says the cost of its new ad is " a strong six - figure buy " and will air for two weeks on broadcast , cable , and online			0
the controversial stalking ad is not the only creating some controversy in this election			0
the @entity127 this week started airing a spot attacking @entity6 by featuring some of @entity2 ' past positions , such as voting against former house speaker and current minority leader @entity131 , as it tries to show @entity2 was more independent than @entity6 is			1
@entity2 released a statement saying : " no organization or person -- no matter which party they say they represent -- should think they can come to @entity4 and pretend to speak for me ... i work hard to speak , but 's my voice			2
so take it from me : @entity6 is an independent leader in @entity78 , and no one will fight harder for our community			2

@entity2 continues to recover from a 2011 shooting
she 's recorded a video ad for her successor , @entity6
@entity6 is in a tough re-election campaing , opposed by @entity22 @entity21
