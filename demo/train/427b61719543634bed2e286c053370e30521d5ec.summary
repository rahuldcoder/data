@entity0 -- the man behind a lavish @entity5 conference in @entity6 that critics have lambasted as a waste of taxpayer money and emblematic of government excess has left the agency , a federal spokesman said thursday			1
senators encourage @entity5 to ' clean house ' @entity14 , a regional commissioner , had been placed on administrative leave in march for his part in organizing a 2010 conference in @entity18 that cost $ 800,000			1
as of thursday , he is " no longer employed with @entity5 , " said @entity19 , deputy press secretary for the agency			2
who 's on first ? hearing shows @entity5 's dysfunction what exactly led to @entity14 's departure was not immediately clear			2
but a @entity5 official who asked not to be identified discussing personnel matters noted that federal employees have the right to retire as long as they have accumulated the required years of service			1
the @entity32 @entity31 could still implicate @entity14 in its criminal investigation , though , even after he has left the agency , the official added			0
@entity14 has been asked to reimburse the government for a private , in - room party that he hosted , the official added			0
earlier this spring , @entity14 -- who was famously pictured in one photo in a bathtub in a @entity6 hotel room , with wine glasses nearby -- cited his fifth amendment rights in refusing to testify before @entity44			1
rep. @entity45 , the @entity47 @entity46 who chairs the @entity49 , chided @entity14 for leaving " many questions unanswered " even as he stressed that issues with the @entity5 go well beyond him			1
" mr. @entity14 's conduct certainly diminished his ability to continue as a senior public servant , " @entity45 said in a statement			0
" in fact , the problems at @entity5 may far exceed his involvement in the waste of taxpayer dollars that has outraged @entity32			0
" another @entity49 @entity46 , @entity61 of @entity62 , cheered the news that @entity14 no longer works for the @entity5			1
he added that he will push legislation aimed at forcing federal employees to answer questions from @entity44 -- as @entity14 refused to do before not just @entity45 's committee but also the @entity68 helmed by @entity61 -- or else risk being fired			1
" in order to deal with this type of situation in the future , i plan to introduce legislation that will allow the immediate termination of senior level ( government ) executives who violate their oaths of office by refusing to cooperate with congressional investigations or to testify before @entity44 , " @entity61 said in a statement			0
describing the billions of dollars in contracts and services handled by the @entity5 as a source of temptation , senators from both parties last month called for the agency to clean house as it roots out corruption			0
the scandal came to light earlier this year when @entity5 inspector general @entity93 released a final report shedding light on the @entity6 conference as well as violations of travel and spending rules			1
among other details , the report explained how @entity14 , and presumably others , avoided strictures against supplying food at government work conferences such as the @entity6 event by creating joke awards in order to hold ceremonies at which food would be allowed			2
the controversy , which includes allegations of personal travel under the thin guise of government business and an employee award program that exceeded spending limits , so far has focused on one of 10 regions of the @entity5 -- an agency with a multibillion - dollar budget and more than 12,000 employees			0
the revelations have prompted taxpayer indignation and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the @entity5 , which handles government real estate and other nonmilitary procurement			0
coming in an election year , the scandal has become a political focal point , with republicans seeking to frame it as a reflection of big government abuse and criticizing the fact that @entity14 took more trips on the federal dime after the release of @entity93 's preliminary report last year showing spending and travel abuses			2
democrats , meanwhile , say the problem predated @entity145 becoming president and involved a few bad players rather than a rotten system .			0
