-- right about now , some intern at @entity2 is probably carting a few crates of champagne into the boardroom			0
or at the very least least a couple buckets of @entity8 candy			0
the studio had a terrific weekend , breaking the september box office slump with the top two hits in the country			1
" @entity17 " led the way with a tremendous $ 43 million from 3,349 theaters — the highest september opening weekend of all time ahead of " @entity15 's " $ 35.6 million bow a full decade ago			1
the monster hit , which earned an " a- " @entity21 grade and a sizzling $ 12,840 per theater average , will continue to play to family audiences in the weeks leading up to the great pumpkin holiday , and will easily break the $ 100 million mark — a milestone that has evaded main voice actor @entity28 's last two films , " @entity29 " ( $ 36.9 million ) and " @entity30 " ( $ 74.2 million )			2
for the still - young @entity33 ( the animation division entered the marketplace in 2006 with @entity35 ) , " @entity17 's " strong debut is the studio 's best opening weekend yet			1
@entity33 's former top dog was " @entity38 , " which started with $ 30.3 million on its way to $ 124.9 million total in 2009			2
" @entity17 , " which cost @entity2 $ 85 million , will almost certainly beat that total			1
@entity41 and @entity42 have already proved that there 's room in the animation game for studios other than @entity47 — especially thanks to the lucrative international market — and it seems @entity2 is growing into a viable contender as well			0
" @entity17 's " debut trailed the openings of " @entity52 " ( $ 66.3 million ) and " @entity53 " ( $ 60.3 million ) substantially , but it was right in line with " @entity56 : @entity58 's " start ( $ 46.6 million )			1
still , the animated title was n't the only reason for @entity2 to be happy this weekend			0
the time - bending sci - fi thriller " @entity62 " got off to a strong start as well with $ 21.2 million from 2,992 locations , immediately setting itself up as a winner for distributor @entity67 , a subsidiary of @entity2			1
the @entity70 / @entity69 vehicle rode a wave of positive reviews over the course of the weekend			0
after a $ 6.9 million friday , the film ticked up an encouraging 28 percent to $ 8.8 million on saturday — a sign of positive word - of - mouth , despite the film 's mediocre " b " cinemascore grade			1
for star @entity69 , " @entity62 " establishes box - office viability after the terrible performance of his bike messenger film " @entity83 , " which earned only $ 19.8 million following its august 's debut			1
the film was financed for a slim $ 35 million by @entity85 , who partnered with @entity87 distributor @entity86			2
working with the @entity87 distributor paid off in a big way in @entity87 , where " @entity62 " ( which portrays a futuristic , dominant @entity87 ) is expected to earn about $ 24 million , making this the first time @entity87 has ever been the number one territory for a film at the global box office			1
@entity94 certainly are a changin '			0
the next three spots on the chart are occupied by last weekend 's top three films			1
" @entity99 " fell 39 percent to $ 8.0 million and has now grossed $ 26.2 million			1
" @entity100 " dipped 38 percent to $ 7.5 million and has now earned $ 23.7 million			2
and " @entity101 " declined 41 percent to $ 7.2 million and has now found $ 22.2 million			0
@entity17 -- $ 43.0 million 2			1
@entity62 -- $ 21.2 million 3			2
end of watch -- $ 8.0 million 4			0
trouble with the @entity103 -- $ 7.5 million 5			0
@entity101 -- $ 7.2 million just outside the @entity107 , @entity105 's buzzy $ 17 million a cappella comedy " @entity106 " proved to be just that			1
playing in only 335 theaters , the glee - ful singing competition flick grossed a tremendous $ 5.2 million , giving " @entity106 " a robust $ 15,560 per theater average — the strongest of all movies that reported box - office numbers today			1
perhaps unsurprisingly , audiences were 74 percent female			0
@entity105 will launch the film , which earned an " a " @entity21 , into about 2,800 theaters next weekend			2
look for it to hit a box - office high note			0
way back in 10th place was @entity42 's new wide release " @entity127 , " the teaching drama starring @entity122 and @entity123			0
the film , which cost a reported $ 19 million to make , bombed with only $ 2.7 million from 2,515 theaters , yielding a wretched $ 1,074 per theater average			2
someone please bring those ladies an apple			0
@entity136 's " @entity135 " had another great week in limited release			0
the @entity139 / @entity138 feature grossed $ 1.1 million from 102 theaters , giving @entity141 a terrific $ 11,150 theater average			1
@entity136 will continue to expand the film in the next few weeks			0
meanwhile " @entity56 : @entity58 " set a box - office record overseas , where the film has now earned $ 693.9 million — the highest international total of all time for an animated film			1
meanwhile , the film 's $ 159.6 million domestic cume is a franchise - low for the " @entity56 " films			2
like i said , times are a changin '			0
