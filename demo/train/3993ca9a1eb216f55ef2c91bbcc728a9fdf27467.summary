-- @entity1 is the ceo of @entity2 and @entity3 and @entity4 and is often cited as one of the most powerful women in banking			1
she tells @entity0 's @entity8 how women lead differently from their male counterparts			1
@entity0 : do women run banks , or businesses differently ? jf : we do , and it 's not just a gender thing			1
if you 're from @entity17 you run it differently than an @entity19 -- it 's just true diversity			1
in the private bank i worked in , a third of the leadership team was female , you then had a slight shift in the way the team worked			1
i often put women into roles where they 're thinking about the broad franchise , they have this awareness of collateral damage and can be more nurturing			1
they really build the team , they want to win as much as the men , they just do n't need all the badges			1
being qualified @entity0 : do you sometimes take a job before you feel ready ? and believe that if you are being chosen for it , you will learn on the job ? jf : i 've moved into three businesses that i did n't know anything about			2
it 's all about the team you get , you have to get very comfortable choosing people who work with you and who are going to be better than you			2
your job is to lead , not to have all the answers			2
@entity0 : when you took the job at @entity4 , 90 percent of people said to you that you were crazy			2
why ? jf : i 'd been running a private bank at @entity58 , which is a joyous franchise because you get an opportunity to meet some of the most successful business men and women in the world			1
a lot of your day is spent talking to clients , it 's truly a privilege			2
to do that and then move to a business that was at the beginning of a very negative cycle -- it 's not an obvious move from a business that 's in good shape			2
but i love the opportunity to turn something around , to try and make a difference			2
being balanced @entity0 : how did you balance your work and home life ? jf : my husband was running a bank , over in @entity85 , we sat down in 2008 and said ; ' one of us has to stop for family '			1
he 's a decade older than me and he said , " okay , i 'll be the one who will go and do something different			2
" there was no way we could carry on			0
that was the peak of the ( financial ) crisis			0
his bank was sold , and he moved into working for boards and investing , and also spending more time with the kids			0
if it had been me , i 'd have done it willingly too , because i 'm a mum , and that 's a joy			0
@entity0 : you have said you can not have it all			0
jf : you can not have it all at the same time			0
you can have it all , spread over decades			0
i think of my life in different chunks			1
when the kids were little , i needed to be around more , but it 's different now			0
@entity0 : you 've also said that you had to get good at saying no. jf : yes , and it was funny that - it sounds ridiculous now , but i can remember saying to my clients ; " i ca n't do the meeting on thursday , because thursday 's the day that i 'm at home with my son "			0
then they 'd always say , " oh , no problem			0
" it made you human			0
if you 're advising people , and trying to help them change and you do n't have humanity , you 're just not relevant			0
watching the millennials @entity0 : some have said that especially in banking , millennials tend to want a little bit more of a work - life balance , have you noticed that ? that they want more than just their job			1
jf : yes , we do see that in millennials who are both customers as well as employees			1
every generation should shape what they want to be , they 're still in discovery			0
what i love about the millennials is they really give a damn			1
they want to know there 's more purpose , there 's other things in life , and that 's going to make the world a much richer place			1
@entity0 : what is the advice that you would give to someone aspiring to be the next @entity1 ? jf : have more courage early - on			1
do n't feel you 've got to be perfect all the time			0
it just holds you back from doing your best because you do n't put yourself into a more stretching situation			0
i did n't do that for the first ten years of my career			1
it 's a fear of doing as well as you could do , if you do n't go for it , you 're missing the point			0
more : the first ' troll - proof ' website ? more : elite club where men are banned @entity173 contributed to this report .			0
