-- @entity2 's short film " @entity3 " was n't exactly a new thing			1
the @entity2 - directed short premiered at the @entity7 critic 's @entity5 in 2012 , and , despite some acclaim , little was made of his portrait of an online film critic			1
' @entity11 ' redband trailer : @entity2 , urinals , ecstasy , and strip clubs but the film was made available online monday , and things quickly spiraled out of control when bloggers noticed that @entity2 's short film bared a striking resemblance to author @entity23 ' comic " @entity22			1
" soon after , articles started dissecting the similarities and direct references to @entity28 ' text without any attribution , and the video disappeared behind a password - protected wall			2
@entity2 had remained out of touch for most of the day , and his reps did not immediately respond to @entity0 's request for comment			2
but then , early tuesday morning , @entity2 decided to tweet his thoughts on the kerfuffle , culminating in the mea culpa , " i f * * * * d up			1
" @entity41 's ' @entity40 ' will feature body - doubles " @entity43 is n't particularly creative work			0
being inspired by someone else 's idea to produce something new and different is creative work , " he tweeted			0
" in my excitement and @entity50 © as an amateur filmmaker , i got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation ... i 'm embarrassed that i failed to credit @ danielclowes for his original graphic novella @entity22 , which served as my inspiration ... i was truly moved by his piece of work & i knew that it would make a poignant & relevant short			1
i apologize to all who assumed i wrote it			0
i deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @ danielclowes to know that i have a great respect for his work			0
