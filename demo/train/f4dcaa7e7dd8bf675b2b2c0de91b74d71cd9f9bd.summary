it started right on @entity2 with one prominent businessman posing a simple question to a few of his close friends and fellow business leaders : " how can we make sure that young people will see this movie ? " according to @entity11 , co-chairman of investment banking at @entity13 , that simple inquiry quickly led to an initiative supported by more than a score of @entity18 business leaders in @entity19			1
the goal ? to provide funding that would let tens of thousands of @entity19 middle school students see the film " @entity24 " for free			1
now , @entity18 - @entity18 business leaders in two dozen other cities have taken up the challenge of # @entity28 , with the hope that nearly 300,000 middle and high school students across the country will have seen " @entity24 " in its first week			1
what is it that so quickly and powerfully united these business leaders ? what is it about " @entity24 " that struck a chord , leading them to launch this " first - of - its - kind " initiative ? it was not driven by a studio or even by the film 's high profile producer @entity45 , who expressed surprise , excitement and pride at hearing of the plan			2
instead , as @entity11 and others expressed to me , it was their own response to seeing the film that compelled such personages as @entity58 , ceo of @entity59 , @entity60 , the ceo of @entity61 , @entity62 , former ceo of @entity63 , @entity64 ceo of @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity68 ' @entity67 , and 22 others to shape , develop and implement their plan in a series of email exchanges over one weekend			0
without question , " @entity24 " resonates strongly at a time when our country is gripped by race - related protests			0
for many african - americans , the civil rights challenges of 2015 have served as a sobering reminder of the ongoing salience of race and racism in @entity18 life			1
the movie provides a sense of historical context for these ongoing struggles , but more importantly , reminds us of the sacrifices that made possible the success we enjoy today			0
the leaders who created the initiative are direct beneficiaries of those early sacrifices , and they know it			0
most serve on boards of civil rights organizations and african - american and other cultural institutions and are leading philanthropists for causes that elevate @entity104 and struggle			2
the push to expose students to " @entity24 " speaks to their desire that young people today be aware of our rich history and the continuing advocacy still needed for racial equality			1
it provides an opportunity for young people to reclaim and engage a critical -- though distant , for them -- part of @entity104			2
and it also allows these leaders to acknowledge the arc of their own journey			0
many have suggested that the television miniseries " roots " shaped a generation , prompting @entity18 - @entity124 to openly engage the history and devastation wrought by slavery and compelling our country to confront its original sin			0
" @entity24 " has the potential to play a similar role , engaging young people with a history that has powerful resonance for the challenges and struggles we confront today , and bringing to life the courage , the determination and humanity of a generation of african - americans on whose shoulders we all stand .			1

@entity149 , @entity150 : black leaders funding drive to *pay* for students to see " @entity24 "
they say the goal is to ensure that young people are aware of and connect with @entity124 civil rights *heritage*
*writers* : " @entity24 " can provide powerful resonance for the challenges and struggles we confront today
