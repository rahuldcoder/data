fasting and praying for immigration reform is not my story			1
it 's not the story of three fasters , from different walks of life , who decided to go hungry on the @entity9 for what many call an issue that has no hope or prayer in @entity14			2
no , this is the story of families , of personal sacrifice and hope grounded in faith to truly drive the attention to the suffering and plight of millions of immigrants in our great nation			1
it is the story of our country 's legacy in jeopardy			1
our @entity31 is morally undermined with an inefficient , inhumane immigration system that causes more than 300 deaths in the desert each year			1
it is a system that rips apart families , exploits workers and puts our democracy out of reach for millions			2
these are the wounds to our nation and families that drove our movement to the doorsteps of the @entity45 where " @entity46 " blossomed and a sea of crosses stand today , hauntingly symbolizing the human lives lost			2
for 22 days , the energetic @entity50 , a youthfully resilient @entity51 and i abstained from all sustenance , drinking only water in a tent just a mere 530 feet away from @entity58 speaker @entity57 's office			1
day after day , we sat alongside numerous advocates fasting with us in solidarity			0
the risks to which we exposed our bodies were a reminder of the toll our immigrant communities endure every day speaker @entity57 and the @entity58 @entity67 leadership refuse to address @entity31 's greatest moral crisis			1
while we physically grew weaker and our patchy beards exposed our exhaustion , we were strengthened and honored by ordinary @entity31 from all walks of life who , in their most vulnerable state , shared their personal histories			2
many told us how and why their families came to this country			2
some of these stories ended with fulfillment of the @entity81 of citizenship , dignity and a better life			0
others spoke of families torn apart by deportation or loved ones dying alone while crossing the deserts of the @entity90			0
the saddest stories made me hungrier for immigration reform			1
no @entity31 story should end this way , but many do			2
at this point last year , more than 400 people had died while crossing the southern border			0
by 2014 , 2 million people will have been deported			0
these tragedies are everyday occurrences , not an anomaly			0
the common threads among those reaching for the @entity81 and the tragic endings of an unfortunate reality are faith and hope			0
the strength we draw from @entity112 and @entity113 not only enable us to overcome hardship , but also inspire our thirst for justice and our belief that we will prevail			0
knowing that each new day of the fast would include these narratives made me all the more determined to visit speaker @entity57 's office , to attend every community gathering at the tent and to share our stories with president @entity126 , the first lady , vice president @entity128 and countless members of @entity14 and national leaders who took the time to show their support and solidarity with us as we fasted			1
while we were grateful to receive visits from several @entity138 as well , speaker @entity57 ignored our invitation			1
even though he refused to look at fasters face to face , i believe he has seen our resolve			0
the movement for immigration reform has been reignited and we are more dedicated than ever to sounding the drumbeat for reform and citizenship			1
we are far from done			0
i ended my fast and passed the charge to a new generation of advocates			0
congressman @entity152 , grandson of @entity153 , who had once sat shoulder to shoulder with my late friend @entity156 almost half a century ago , stood before me with the fortitude embodied in our growing movement for immigration reform			1
it was a poignant reminder of both the length and the direction of the moral arc of the universe			0
here we are more than 40 years later , fasting and praying for change , but also for our country 's tradition			0
it is a tradition marked by the generations of immigrants that have been integrated into our national fabric and democracy as full @entity31 with the benefits and rights of citizenship			2
this is our country 's legacy .			1
