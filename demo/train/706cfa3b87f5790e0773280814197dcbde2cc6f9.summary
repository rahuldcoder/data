-- 2013 will be a year of harsh change for the tech industry			1
we 've just experienced five years of rapid , messy and disruptive innovation , and smartphones and tablets are n't the future any longer -- they 're the present			0
powerful mobile devices connected to broadband - speed cell networks are now an everyday reality , and it 's going to take more than a bigger screen or faster processor to make an impact this year			0
think of 2013 as the year of refinement and reckoning			1
here are five big developments to keep an eye on : 1			1
the future of @entity21 @entity21 has been very candid about " missing a generation " of mobile innovation after @entity24 introduced the @entity25 , and 2012 was all about the results of a furious catch - up effort : the company launched the completely rethought @entity29 8 for pcs , @entity31 for tablets and @entity33 for smartphones			1
ceo @entity35 also repositioned @entity21 as a " devices and services " company , and he introduced the @entity39 and @entity39 , two tablets designed by @entity21 itself to compete with traditional @entity43 companies such as @entity44 and @entity45			1
that 's a lot of bold bets , and they all have to pay off in 2013			0
the pc era is over , and @entity21 has to show consumers it has something to offer in a world dominated by tablets and smartphones			1
@entity55 and surface sales appear to have been slow so far , so we 'll see how the company does			0
there is one all - but - guaranteed bright spot , though : a new @entity61 is due to be announced this year			0
top tech wishes for 2013 2			1
can @entity24 get its software mojo back ? @entity24 found success in 2012 by introducing an @entity25 with a bigger screen and an @entity66 with a smaller screen , but it 'll have to focus on software in 2013 to stay ahead of the competition			1
@entity24 ceo @entity70 has now launched two iphones since taking over for @entity72 , and both of them have come with buggy , incomplete flagship software features -- the @entity77 launched with the charming - but - not - so - useful @entity79 voice assistant , and the @entity25 launched with a homegrown maps app so buggy that @entity70 was forced to apologize to customers			2
in the meantime , archrival @entity83 has begun shipping some of the best iphone apps around -- i 've replaced most of @entity24 's apps on my @entity25 homescreen with @entity83 - built replacements such as @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			1
most of my peers in the industry have done the same			0
that 's not a good sign			0
@entity70 just fired @entity99 , the controversial head of @entity101 development who presided over @entity79 and @entity91			0
designer @entity102 is now in charge of both hardware and software , so we 'll see if the company can regain its reputation for state - of - the - art software design with the next @entity25 and @entity66			0
will @entity110 go head to head with @entity24 and @entity83 ? @entity110 ceo @entity113 was very blunt when he introduced the new @entity114 in september -- he called it the " best tablet on the market			1
" that was an obvious shot at @entity24 and the @entity66 , but @entity110 's real competitor may well be @entity83 , especially as the market for books , music and movies moves entirely online			1
there 's no way @entity110 wants people searching @entity83 to find content and products from multiple sources			1
@entity110 wants to build an ecosystem so robust you never want to leave			2
think of what @entity24 did for music with the @entity134 and @entity135 and then imagine @entity110 doing that for everything			1
but the @entity114 products are n't good enough to compete with the @entity66 yet , and @entity110 does n't have all the services it needs to compete with @entity83 either			1
it needs to offer at least e-mail and search , and a social experience would n't hurt either			0
that 's not a small undertaking , but @entity110 is one of the few companies with the scale , infrastructure and resources to make it happen			2
the rumors are getting louder			0
we 'll see whether @entity110 makes a big move in 2013			1
can @entity151 grow up ? 2013 will be @entity151 's first year as a public company , and it has to prove that it can be a stable , reliable investment			1
that 's no easy task : @entity151 figured out how to make money selling ads on its website just as most of its users switched to smartphone and tablet apps			2
selling ads on mobile is n't nearly as easy , and @entity151 has to figure out how to display relevant ads to smartphone users without crossing the privacy line -- a line about which users are increasingly worried			2
but ceo @entity168 has to answer to his investors now , and the pressure to cross that line will increase every day that @entity151 is n't making money in mobile			2
can @entity83 take @entity174 back from @entity175 and the wireless carriers ? here 's the brutal truth of the smartphone market : the only companies that make any money are @entity24 and @entity175			1
every other company , from @entity182 to @entity45 to @entity83 's own @entity183 , is struggling			2
and that 's a huge problem for @entity83			2
@entity24 obviously writes its own software for the @entity25 , but @entity175 's phones all run a customized version of @entity83 's open - source @entity174 , and @entity175 is so dominant that it could very well split off and start building its own version of @entity174 , just as @entity110 did with the @entity114			1
that would be a huge blow to @entity83			2
if the rest of the market ca n't make money using @entity174 soon , it 'll provide a big opening for @entity21			1
@entity83 also has to find a way to limit the influence of wireless carriers on @entity174			2
companies such as @entity200 and @entity201 are all too happy to load up @entity174 devices with unnecessary crapware and bloatware that ruin the user experience while delaying important software updates			0
the animosity between @entity83 and the carriers has gotten so deep that @entity83 's new @entity210 flagship device does n't have an @entity212 radio ; the carriers simply would n't cooperate			0
that 's in stark contrast to the @entity25 experience , which is pristine and controlled by @entity24 from the start			0
it 's a control that irritates power users but offers a sense of support and security to the rest of @entity24 's millions of customers			0
there 's a happy balance between the two extremes , and @entity83 needs to find it before @entity174 begins to slip away entirely			0
these are just five of the many interesting things to look out for in 2013 , from the future of tv to the rise of wearable computing			0
after several years of rapid change , we 've all got computers in our pockets			0
the next few years will be about what we do with them to make our lives better			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			0
