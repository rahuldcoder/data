-- an eastern @entity2 gang of hackers bent on stealing company secrets was responsible for recent attacks on @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 as well as dozens of other less - publicized hacks , according to new reports			1
two unnamed " people familiar with the matter " told @entity11 that the hackers appeared to be looking for research , intellectual property or other private information that they can sell on the underground market			0
@entity6 confirmed tuesday that some of its employees ' computers had been compromised after they visited a hacked website for @entity26 developers			1
that site exploited a vulnerability in the @entity30 plug - in			2
weeks earlier , @entity7 said that some of its computers were also compromised after employees visited a developer site			1
both @entity7 and @entity6 said no user data were accessed in the attacks			1
earlier in january , @entity8 said it , too , was attacked and that about 250,000 user accounts may have been compromised , with names and e-mails possibly being uncovered			1
as news of the intrusions spread , suspicions turned toward hackers in @entity43			0
the nation 's government denies it supports hacking			2
but experts said it would n't be surprising if the attacks originated in @entity2 instead			1
" we 've all been watching @entity43 , but they 're not the most advanced cybercriminals , " said @entity50 , the former commissioner of president @entity52 's cybersecurity council and head of security at @entity55			1
" the most advanced are from the @entity58 and @entity59			0
" @entity50 said that a " giant arms bazaar " has developed in @entity2 by which criminals sell cybertools to others			2
that way , he said , organized crime elements and even terror groups end up with the same kind of advanced tools some governments possess			0
" that 's what i 'm most worried about , " @entity50 said			0
" i wish this stuff were just nation - state on nation - state , so then we could crank up our diplomacy			0
but regimes do n't have a monopoly on @entity80 , and they do n't have a monopoly on cyber capabilities			0
" the recent hacks appear to have used what cybersecurity experts call a " water hole " attack			1
like a lion waiting for those speedy gazelles to slow down and have a drink , criminals hack and load viruses onto sites they suspect attractive targets will visit , then wait			0
they do n't know exactly who their victims will be			0
but once the victims are infected , the hackers can follow them back to their own businesses ' networks to snoop around			0
one site used in the attacks appears to be called @entity103 , a forum for developers who work with @entity6 's mobile operating system			1
" @entity111 has learned it was used as part of an attack whose victims included large @entity117 companies , " read a message at the top of the site 's home page wednesday			1
" we have no reason to believe user data ( were ) compromised , but to be safe , we 've reset all user passwords			0
" security holes in @entity124 's java programming language have been responsible for a number of the recent attacks			2
the @entity127 released a warning about the software in january			0
@entity6 pointed out in its statement that @entity132 running the most recent operating system , @entity131 , have not come with @entity134 pre-installed and that the computers automatically disable the plug - in after 35 days of inactivity			1
@entity140 's @entity139 contributed to this report .			2

cybersecurity expert says most savvy web crime originates in @entity2
@entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 attacks came from @entity2 gang , report says
" water hole " attack apparently used a site for developers on @entity6 's mobile system
@entity6 said this week that some employees ' computers had been compromised
