-- getting hired or promoted in today 's competitive environment is no easy feat. but , then again , neither was our pitch for @entity5			2
the rules of the game were made clear : whichever advertising campaign had the best consumer test score would be declared the winner and awarded the @entity5 account			0
yet , despite the fact that our now famous " @entity5 " campaign did not fare well in testing , we won the business , and the rest is history			0
fifteen years later , " priceless " remains one of the most recognizable ad campaigns in recent history			0
so why did we win the business , defying set rules and what early testing said would be a failure ? according to @entity5 's @entity29 @entity28 , it was because of our " core " -- we were a fighting and a cohesive team of competitors , who believed with every ounce of our beings that this campaign would crush their long - standing competitor , @entity38			1
in other words , we had tapped their " hidden agenda			1
" the hidden agenda is the unspoken , visceral , emotional motivation that is behind every decision			1
whether deciding who wins the billion dollar deal ... or the job , the hidden agenda is always at work			1
your mission is to connect to it , and here 's how : do your hidden - agenda homework it 's not enough to know factoids about the company			1
do your homework about the emotional state of the company			1
are they on a high , yet searching for the next big thing ? are they in crisis and in need of a turnaround ? are they guided by a value system that drives the decisions they make ? it turns out that every decision stems from a hidden agenda , which can be found in three forms : â € ¢ @entity76 are about people viewing their circumstances through the lens of ambition and confidence			1
â € ¢ needs are about viewing circumstances through the lens of fear or concern			0
â € ¢ values are about people viewing the world entirely through the lens of their belief systems			0
in addition to understanding the company 's hidden agenda , study the person who will be interviewing you to determine their hidden agenda			1
connect with your real ambition i had breakfast a few weeks ago with a very compelling young man			1
this electrifying fellow was exuberant , quirky bordering on eccentric , and without pretense			0
he spoke of what he hoped to create in his life , and i hired him on the spot			0
your real ambition is a deep desire to create something special that does n't yet exist			1
it 's bigger than mere ambition because it 's noble			1
when the person you are trying to reach is touched by your real ambition and makes common cause , they 'll hire you			1
try this : think about what you want to accomplish , but precede with the words " i will ... " make sure it is seemingly impossible , devoid of practicality and utterly fantastic			0
you can create a shared bond with your interviewer , because they see you both share a common vision			2
see also : is happiness the secret of success ? bond with your credo a company is many things , but it is a community first			2
each community has a set of values that bind them ; i call it a credo , @entity143 for " i believe			0
" dig deeply and look behind the facts and figures			0
what does the company you 're applying to believe ? if you want to be part of it , know it and connect yourself to it			1
try this : take out a sheet of paper , and write " i believe that ... " what words would you select ? what values would you express that would make you proud for others to see ? connections are made because of the beliefs you share			1
you 'll be hired , because your interviewer will see that your credo syncs perfectly with theirs			0
ignite with your core your core is what makes you stand out from the pack			2
while many people have similar traits , your core is comprised of a set of skills , abilities , and strengths that , together , are completely unique to you			2
and as was the case with @entity5 , your core will be seen as something the company needs -- the " answer to their prayers " and a means by which you can help them			1
see also : is workplace boredom ' the new stress ? ' critical to your core is authenticity			2
as a wonderful mentor once told me when i was presenting what i thought was a perfect version of myself and thinking that the real me was no road to glory : the person you are is the person they want to see			2
they are hiring you , not a manufactured version of something or someone else			0
try this : ask five people who know you well and support you to write down the key characteristics they associate with you			2
not only will you be staggered by what you 'll get , but you will also feel proud and affirmed			0
you mobilize people to hire you , because their vital needs are satisfied by the authenticity and sincerity of your core			0
your pursuit for the promotion or job of your dreams is not a fact and figures game -- it is a human game			0
when you make a profound connection with the emotional desire of your boss or interviewer , the facts and figures will take the backseat , every time			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

every company has an emotional motivation , or hidden agenda , says @entity227
he believes tapping into the hidden agenda is key to getting your dream job
share your ' real ambition ' to connect with potential *employers*
when applying for a job , show that you connect with the company 's core beliefs
