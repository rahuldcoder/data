-- the fight to save lives may no longer be the most stressful part of work for some @entity6 surgeons			1
@entity8 staff are being fitted with data - collecting @entity10 chips at the ' @entity12 facility			1
the chips , embedded in regular @entity15 badges , track their movements and time management , feeding into a central database			1
the @entity8 is a new frontier for a scheme that started in 2011 with the hospital 's nursing staff , and has been spreading ever since			2
management have been encouraged by the results			2
" there was nervousness at first about being tracked , " says @entity25 , performance manager at the hospital			2
" but over time as we showed it was not being used punitively , they adapted very quickly and got into their normal routines			2
" if the data is effective , those routines will be greatly improved			2
based on the feedback received , @entity25 says that staff have been located too far from each other and patients , and that the workplace environment is to be modified to improve communication			0
the figures are also helping to reconstitute shift patterns to best suit staff , who are given access to their performance data and provide input on what their ideal routine would be			0
the model can facilitate dramatic improvements in efficiency and transparency across the industry , @entity25 believes : " this gives us the ability to better manage our resources			1
for a value - based purchasing model , we need to better understand patients and staff to make the right decisions , which other industries have been doing for years			1
" hopefully we can get to a place where we are truly transparent with patients and their families -- where we can allow them to access data and track patients through the or			0
" @entity12 represents the cutting edge of the increasingly pervasive and diffuse field of workforce analytics			1
from efficiency gains to unmasking misconduct and promoting well - being , the incentives for employers are clear			1
it is increasingly common for firms to monitor their employees ' computers - down to the key stroke - and to rifle through their communications made using company equipment			1
tools for monitoring active workers in the field are also developing			1
gps tracking is now industry standard for long - haul truck drivers			1
ostensibly for the purpose of productivity , and occasionally protection in the case of high - risk cargo , the satellite can paint a vivid picture of the subject 's life on the road			1
wearable trackers , such as the hospital 's @entity10 tags , can provide even more detail			1
major companies such as @entity110 and @entity111 have fitted their staff with devices that allow micro-analysis of their performance , and are also used to direct them			0
the reach of quantified health has extended into the workplace			0
in a pioneering initiative , @entity120 distributed @entity123 devices to provide health and activity feedback for their employees			0
the company says the benefit is in greater wellbeing for their staff , leading to improved performance , although it acknowledges the data will also save them money on insurance premiums			0
but if there are disturbing possibilities , the opportunities outweigh the risks , believes @entity139 , founder of @entity140 , an offshoot of @entity143 's @entity142 , and a passionate evangelist for the benefits of workforce analytics			1
the start - up produces arguably the most advanced wearable trackers , including sensors for motion , sound , infra - red , that break down behaviour patterns into granular data			1
this is gathered on an opt - in basis and is made available to the employees themselves , while management have anonymized , aggregated data to guide improvements			1
" you can see the top performers and change behaviour accordingly , to be happier and more productive , " says @entity139			0
" in a retail store , you might see that you spend 20 % of your time talking to customers , but the guy who makes the most commission spends 30 %			0
" the simple and consistent lessons from the data can have a transformative effect on company culture and practice , @entity139 believes			0
" what 's fascinating is that in any industry the interaction between employees is the most important thing that happens at work ... the sort of feedback we 're giving is ' have lunch with a colleague you have n't met before ' or ' only eat lunch with people on your team '			1
we relate outcomes to behavioural data , which shows the value of relationships between people			0
" a new paradigm for a worker - oriented " village " may sound romantic , but @entity139 says this is backed up by hard results			1
" in @entity198 call centers we have increased performance by 20 % and reduced turnover by 28 %			0
but it 's not just a case of saving tens of millions of dollars -- i can also point to thousands of people that say they like their job better			0
" @entity140 's technology has been tested at several dozen companies , and @entity139 anticipates that half of the @entity210 will be using the model within 10 years			0
but if he is excited about the possibilities , he acknowledges the risk			0
" my worry is that some companies come into the space that force people into it , give companies ( de-anonymized ) data on those people , and then the whole field gets legislated out of existence			2
" @entity139 would like to see regulation introduced along the lines of the @entity227 @entity226 ( @entity226 ) , which precludes medical providers from sharing patient data			0
but academics specializing in workforce analytics believe it is fraught with ethical issues			1
" there are huge concerns over work intensification and increased stress , people have different stress reactions , " says professor @entity234 , of the @entity236 's @entity235			2
" monitoring raises the stakes in the employment relationship and can have negative effects if it 's applied to the wrong activity , which would be better managed qualitatively			2
" ball hopes that limits are established for use of data collection			0
" monitoring technology is potentially pervasive into private life , and we do ethically need to think about privacy boundaries , particularly if ( the technology ) intrudes on the body or social space			2
" performance data may also lead to harsher workplace environment , suggests professor @entity261 of @entity262 , author of the 2011 paper ' from @entity264 to @entity265			0
' " the technology allows you to get rid of people at the lower end of performance range , which pushes average performance up			0
you could have what happens in finance with audits on a quarterly basis with the bottom 10 % sacked			0
" both academics agree with @entity139 in that legislation is behind the technology , and ill - suited to preventing abuse			2
employees are often unaware of their rights to challenge pervasive monitoring , and may be forced into ' hacking ' as their only means to avoid it			2
at the dystopian end of the scale , there are fears that the field could run amok to the point of even allowing chips under the skin , as has been practiced with @entity227 patients			1
for all the possibilities of increased productivity and even well - being , workforce analytics must contend with severe trust issues			1
