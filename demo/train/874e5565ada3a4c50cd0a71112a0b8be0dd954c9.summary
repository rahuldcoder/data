-- two recent incidents have people questioning the basic goodness of humanity			1
in @entity6 , a man had a fatal heart attack across the street from a fire station			2
passers - by said firefighters refused to help him because they had n't been officially dispatched			0
at an elementary school in @entity14 , staff members seized and discarded children 's lunches because their parents owed money on their accounts			1
) officials in @entity6 say they are " furious " at the firefighters ' inaction			0
a mother of one of the students in @entity27 says she was " blind - sided " by the school 's actions , and a state senator says he is " incredibly disappointed			1
" the anger and bewilderment are understandable			0
but neither incident seems that shocking when considered in light of decades of study of the psychology of obedience and power			0
researchers have repeatedly found that allegiance to rules and protocols routinely trumps people 's consciences and sense of basic moral responsibility			1
most famously , studies by @entity48 at @entity49 in the 1960s found that ordinary people were willing to give what they believed were fatal electric shocks to their partners in a bogus " memory experiment " simply because a researcher in a white lab coat told them to			1
the people supposedly getting shocked ( who were working with @entity48 and not being hurt at all ) hollered and pleaded for the shocks to stop , which distressed many of the people administering them , but they kept at it			2
in fact , roughly two - thirds of the participants kept giving shocks until they had reached the highest voltage level possible , a percentage far higher than @entity48 or any of his colleagues anticipated			0
in a similar vein , the infamous @entity71 run by psychologist @entity73 took typical @entity75 undergrads and randomly assigned them to be guards or prisoners in a makeshift jail			0
the guards completely took on their new roles and meted out cruel and sadistic treatment to their " prisoners			0
" the authority they were given and the rules they were asked to enforce blinded them to what was right â € ” and perhaps the same could be said for those school officials and firefighters			1
it 's important to keep in mind that the participants in @entity91 and @entity73 's studies were n't necessarily bad people			1
they were likely no worse than you or me			0
they , too , were likely " blind - sided by the surprisingly strong ways that rules and circumstance can dictate our behavior			2
while we would like to believe that humanity has evolved since the 1960s , other researchers have achieved similar results in more recent years			2
is the upshot of all this that we 're condemned to be unprincipled sheep ? that a few rules and regulations can easily blind us to the better angels of our nature ? not so fast			2
the research shows that while external influences on our behavior can be strong , they are not insurmountable			0
we can overcome these influences simply by becoming more aware of them			0
one set of studies found that when people attended social psychology lectures explaining how external pressures can inhibit moral behavior , they became less susceptible to those pressures			1
other evidence suggests that being reminded of one 's similarities or common humanity with a person in need can motivate us to come to their aid , even when doing so puts ourselves at risk			1
perhaps if bystanders ' appeals to those firefighters had struck a more personal chord with them , they might have been jarred into action			0
finally , throughout history , we have seen examples of people who displayed great altruism , even heroism , while most everyone around them remained bystanders to evil â € ” or perpetrators of it			2
some evidence suggests that the roots of this caring behavior extend back into childhood			0
a seminal study by @entity157 and @entity158 suggests that one commonality of people who rescued @entity160 during the holocaust was that their parents nurtured empathy in them , such as by encouraging them to see the world from other points of view and emphasizing the universal similarity of people			1
indeed , the childhood roots of altruism were evoked by another story in the news this week : the story of 10 - year - old @entity172 , who noticed that something seemed awry in a neighbor 's garage and pressured his mother to investigate			1
despite his mother 's resistance , @entity172 persisted until his mother agreed to walk down the street			2
she found an 80 - year - old neighbor who had slipped , could n't get up , and likely would have died had she spent much more time trapped outside in the freezing cold			0
rather than remaining quiet or succumbing to the pressure not to make waves , @entity172 stayed attuned to his moral instinctsâ € ” " something just did n't feel right , " he said			0
sometimes it 's nice to be reminded that while sensing what 's right can get complicated by adult rules and regulations , it can still come naturally to kids			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			1

@entity195 : stories of school lunches grabbed from kids , man ignored by rescuers draw shock
how does this happen ? studies show people all too blindly obey rules , authority , he says
marsh : it 's surmountable . people can be reminded of humanity , *taught* empathy
marsh : story of boy , on his own instincts , urging mom to check on fallen neighbor gives hope
