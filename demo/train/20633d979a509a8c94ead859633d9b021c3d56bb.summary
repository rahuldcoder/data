@entity0 -- how did an unlicensed professional , who led people to believe he was a medical doctor , run a facility for adolescents with mental illness and drug abuse problems for decades , despite complaint after complaint to state regulators alleging abuse ? that 's the question that haunts some of the alleged victims of an inpatient treatment center that operated in @entity15 , @entity16 , for about 30 years			1
a @entity1 investigation uncovered at least 15 civil suits and some two dozen complaints to state regulators against @entity21 of @entity16 , also known as @entity22			1
the allegations include verbal and sexual abuse , unauthorized discontinuance of psychotropic medication and fraud			1
the man in charge , @entity22 's president and founder , @entity30 , was not a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist in the state of @entity16 , yet he was allegedly treating patients , and participating in and enabling the abuse at his facility			1
" it did the most incredible damage to our family , " said @entity39 , who 's filed a civil suit against @entity22 , @entity30 and other staff members			1
@entity39 and @entity46 turned to @entity22 in 2011 to help their then - 16 - year - old daughter , @entity47 , a star soccer player who was struggling with mental illness and drug addiction			0
but instead of getting help , the @entity50 say , @entity47 was harmed			0
in their civil suit , the @entity50 claim @entity47 " was repeatedly told by @entity22 staff that she was a ' bitch , ' ' dumb , ' and a [ expletive ]			1
she was told that her parents did n't love her and that she was the source of all their problems			0
" the @entity50 also allege @entity47 was cut off from her family , was abruptly taken off her bipolar medication without authorization , and was brainwashed into believing she was faking her mental illness			1
" as a result of her experience at @entity22 , @entity62 became more depressed , suicidal and filled with self - loathing , " according to the civil suit			1
@entity62 took her own life in 2012 , less than a year after leaving @entity22			0
in court documents , @entity22 and staff deny all claims			0
the @entity50 ' suit is pending , but both sides tell @entity1 they have agreed on settlement terms			1
complaint after complaint the @entity50 are not alone			0
@entity16 public records obtained by @entity1 detail similar complaints and other alleged abuses that date back to the mid- 1980s			1
the allegations of abuse include sexual misconduct during physical exams , such as fondling and measuring genitalia			1
another civil suit involving a 14 - year - old patient of @entity22 , who is referred to only as " @entity86 " because she is a minor , alleges : " @entity86 was required to bend over and touch her toes while [ staff members ] stood behind her , evaluating her exposed buttocks and genitalia			1
@entity86 was then told to squat and ' walk like a duck ' across the floor			0
" the civil suit alleges the patient began to cry and was threatened with humiliation -- " she would be labeled as having [ sexually transmitted diseases ] ... and disallowed from participating in certain activities " -- if she did not allow the exam			1
@entity22 and staff members deny these allegations			0
court documents show a settlement is pending			0
public records also show repeated complaints of verbal abuse made to the @entity110 as early as 1990 through 2012 that allege degrading , derogatory , humiliating , and at times racially charged rants directed at patients and family members			1
a county social worker who attended a patient evaluation wrote to state regulators in 1998 : " i am concerned that the treatment my client recently received in a pre-placement interview ... was demeaning and humiliating to him and basically stripped away his dignity as a human being			1
... in my opinion , they tore him to shreds			0
... in the 20 years i 've worked in the field of @entity131 , i have never seen a professional treat a youngster in a way that totally disregards him as a human being with worth			1
... incarceration is more humane			0
" " we were just belittled and degraded and made to feel so small we could barely get up off the mat , " said @entity136 , the plaintiff in another civil suit			1
@entity136 said her son @entity140 , 16 years old at the time , was neglected and abused at @entity22 in 2010			2
his family checked him into @entity22 after a psychiatrist had diagnosed @entity140 with major depression with psychotic features , a precursor to schizophrenia , and had started him on medication			2
" we were told that the next step would be to have him in residential care for a few weeks to get him acclimated to his medication , " @entity136 told @entity1			1
the @entity136 lawsuit alleges @entity22 discontinued @entity140 ' medications abruptly and without tapering			0
" my illness just progressively got worse when i was there , " @entity155 told @entity1			1
he said he started hallucinating , hearing voices and begged for his medication but was denied			0
" i was way worse when i left			0
just the voices were really bad , " he said			0
@entity155 has been diagnosed with schizophrenia since leaving @entity22			0
@entity136 described her son 's treatment as abuse			2
" the abuse of not being allowed to have his medications			2
the abuse of being told that he 's basically , no good , just the scum of the earth , that he 's just a liar and a manipulator and he 's really not sick			2
" @entity22 and staff members , named as defendants in the @entity175 civil suit , deny all of these allegations			2
@entity136 said the civil suit was a result of months of research " because no normal person could wrap their head around what was going on at @entity22			2
" she discovered that @entity30 was n't licensed to practice medicine or psychotherapy but was allegedly diagnosing and treating patients			1
" what we experienced there was bait and switch , " @entity136 said			0
' dr. panio ' @entity30 got his doctorate in psychology in 1979 from a distance - learning school			0
its accreditation at the time was not government - approved and it no longer offers phds in psychology , the school confirmed to @entity1			1
but he went by " dr. @entity30 " even before 1979			0
in fact , officials at @entity203 , where he was a faculty member from 1972 to 1978 , told @entity1 they believed he was a medical doctor			1
university records show him listed as " @entity30 , @entity209 " @entity211 articles dating as far back as 1970 even refer to him as " dr. @entity30 " " i think he experienced great joy in pulling strings and controlling people 's lives and affecting them and playing doctor , " said @entity136			0
@entity1 tried repeatedly to contact @entity30 , both directly and through his lawyers , to ask about the allegations of abuse at @entity22 and about his credentials , but he avoided our cameras and never returned phone calls			1
in court documents , @entity30 denies all allegations of abuse and stands by his credentials			2
@entity30 's attorney @entity228 told @entity229 can not talk due to settlement terms in a number of civil suits , including the @entity50 ' and @entity233 '			1
the state 's response during the approximately 30 years @entity30 ran his facility , state records show he was only registered to practice psychotherapy between 1992 and 1998			1
the state confirms he was never licensed as a psychiatrist or psychologist in @entity16			1
hundreds of pages of public records obtained by @entity1 show state regulators were alerted to problems at @entity22 and they did investigate			1
yet , time and again , the authorities said the allegations " could not be confirmed			0
" the @entity249 did issue @entity30 a cease - and - desist order in march of 2013 for his alleged diagnosis and treatment of patients at @entity22 , which @entity30 appealed			2
the state @entity255 told @entity1 the parties are still waiting for a ruling by the administrative law judge regarding this case			1
even so , the cease - and - desist order only addresses @entity30 's licensing issues , not the alleged abuse			2
the @entity110 , the @entity255 and even the governor 's office refused multiple requests for an interview by @entity1			1
instead , the @entity268 and regulatory agencies issued a joint statement that reads : " any additional information regarding this former facility , mr. @entity30 and the respective licenses and credentials is part of an ongoing case in which final disposition has not been reached and therefore can not be discussed in an interview			0
" the state never shut down @entity22			2
the facility closed voluntarily on july 1 , 2013 , after several of the civil suits were filed leading to at least one key member of the staff leaving			1
many of the employees , who allegedly participated in the abuse , are licensed to continue working			1
no criminal charges have been filed involving @entity22			0
however , @entity15 police are investigating			0
" we 've had to involve a lot of other agencies on this particular investigation			2
unfortunately , there 's not a whole lot i can discuss at this time because the case is still under investigation , " said @entity292 , public information officer for the @entity293			2
demanding justice for the @entity39 family , it 's not enough			0
" i think ( @entity22 ) shoved us over a bridge , burned it , and then took away any tools we had to rebuild it , " said @entity46			0
" the mess they made in her mind was permanent and final			0
" her parents allege @entity22 staff convinced their daughter that she was faking her mental illness			2
" @entity312 believed it when she got out			0
she truly believed she was a fraud , that she was a cheat , she was a liar , that she was all of the things she was prompted and worse , " @entity46 said			2
a note from @entity47 's journal , written at @entity22 , reads : " i 'm a fraud			2
i 'm just a waste of space ...			0
i want to be gone from here			0
whether that looks like jail , an institution , or death			0
" @entity62 was just 17 years old when she killed herself			0
" they sucked the life out of our daughter , " @entity39 told @entity1			1
" somebody needs to do something			0
