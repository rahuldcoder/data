" there have been polling places where there was no down time , " said @entity18 , the secretary of @entity14 's state board of elections			1
" there was a consistent , heavy stream of voters			2
" but the process was " very error - free , " he said			2
earlier in the day , those long lines prompted some voters to walk away in states such as @entity13 and @entity32 , election observers said			1
politics : no surprises for @entity35 , @entity36 in earliest projections in @entity39 , one of the most closely watched swing states , authorities recorded only a handful of complaints			1

numerous problems were reported around @entity61			0
the nonpartisan election monitors from the independent @entity63 said two voting machines had broken down at one precinct on the city 's north side , forcing poll workers to issue provisional ballots			1

as many as 64 of the monitors had been turned away before a judge ordered election officials to admit them , the local @entity81 chapter said			0
one of the complaints about misbehaving electronic voting machines occurred in @entity102 , in central @entity32 's @entity103 , where election officials said they recalibrated the unit after one voter recorded a video of it registering a vote for @entity35 as one for his @entity81 challenger , @entity36			1
the video drew thousands of comments on @entity114 and was first confirmed by @entity115			2
but @entity117 , a spokesman for the @entity32 secretary of state 's office , told @entity0 the machine was taken offline after the man complained about it , election workers recalibrated it and there have been no more complaints			1
a second complaint emerged later tuesday in @entity126 , in nearby @entity127			0
@entity128 told @entity0 that he pressed the box to select @entity35 several times , only to see the machine indicate a vote for @entity36			2
@entity128 also captured the scene on video , showing him pressing the @entity35 box several times before the vote registered correctly			2
@entity128 said he reported the problem to a volunteer poll worker who was calm and receptive to the issue and told him the machine had been having problems all day			2
opinion : from @entity143 , a lesson for election " i thought , gee , that 's probably not the reaction to have when casting a ballot for president of the @entity4 , " he said			0
the worker suggested he use a pencil eraser to finish his ballot , but the video he shot shows the same issue			2
@entity128 said he saw workers shutting down the machine as he left			2
@entity157 , @entity127 's director of elections , confirmed there was an issue with one voting machine , but said there were no further issues after the machine was recalibrated			1
in other states , most complaints focused on long lines			1
but in @entity168 , @entity13 , which includes @entity169 , officials had to send a corrective message to 12,000 absentee voters on tuesday after an automated call told them they needed to get their ballot in " tomorrow			1
" the message was supposed to have gone out monday , but was sent out tuesday because of a computer glitch , said @entity175 , a spokeswoman for the county supervisor of elections			0
why you ca n't vote online yet in the @entity181 suburb of @entity182 , @entity39 , @entity179 said an optical - scan voting machine jammed at her precinct , backing up the line and leaving voters confused as to how their votes would be counted			1
