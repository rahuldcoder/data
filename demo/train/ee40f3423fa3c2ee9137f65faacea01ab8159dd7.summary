@entity0 , @entity1 -- this @entity4 weekend @entity3 will be packed with nearly 300,000 people , as the @entity6 holds its annual convention , and folks from across the country descend on the @entity10 for three days of partying and concerts featuring @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , all headliners at the 16th annual @entity17			2
but the residents in this rural town -- as well as others in @entity21 , the county seat of @entity23 -- too are concerned about the earth , wind and fire			1
yet their thoughts are not about the musical group , but instead , the devastation being wreaked on their way of life in the region as a result of the @entity35 oil catastrophe , the worst environmental disaster in @entity38 history			1
while local , state and federal officials throw as many resources as possible to prevent the millions of gallons leaked thus far from causing more damages to the beaches and coastline of the @entity48 , the residents here are under a heavy degree of stress			1
some admittedly still facing down post-traumatic stress , a result of @entity53 five years ago , they now face the possibility of losing their livelihood as the oil makes its way to the east bank of the @entity60			1
the water means everything to the people here			2
the local economy is based entirely on the money earned from the fishing industry , and since may , the boats have been idled because of the oil disaster			1
i am here to shoot a special for my @entity72 show , @entity71			0
this town is largely @entity38 , and considering our network targets @entity75 , it was an ideal place to focus our attention			2
but the heartache and strain i am hearing in @entity21 is the same in other towns , whether the faces are white , @entity83 , or @entity84			0
it really is hard to fathom what this disaster will do to the residents here , many of them third - generation fishermen			1
the water is all they know , and if they ca n't make a living doing this , there really is nothing else to do			0
the countryside of southern @entity1 is gorgeous -- though the heat is stifling and the mosquitoes plentiful -- but this is very much a coastal community			0
there are no massive shopping centers , large manufacturing facilities or high tech parks			0
the bottom line : no fishing ; no money ; no life			1
on thursday evening , a number of the town 's residents filed into the @entity112			1
@entity113 in @entity0 for a community rally with the rev. @entity115 prior to the meeting , several of the fisherman vented their frustration to the rev. @entity120 , who has been a leading voice on the oil disaster here , and to @entity124 , president of @entity23			1
@entity124 told the fishermen , many dressed in t - shirts , jeans and work boots , that he feels their pain , and is doing everything he can to fight through the bureaucracy and get resources to the fishermen , namely jobs converting their fishing boats into skimmers to pick up the oil			1
" this week they [ @entity35 ] are supposed to put a whole ' nother crew of boats out and rotate some of them off on a 30 - , 60 - , 90 - day [ schedule ] to get some money for the people that ai n't been " working , he said , who added that the outside contractors are being paid $ 3,000 a day for oil cleanup			1
" what we are trying to do is get work for all of the fishermen full time			0
" rev. @entity120 , with a black and gold @entity152 in hand , said it 's time for president @entity155 to come to small towns like @entity21 and hear firsthand from the men and women who are scraping by , angry with the bureaucracy that is preventing the resources from flowing			2
he is still seething from a meeting last week with @entity162 , the @entity163 attorney president @entity155 appointed to oversee the $ 20 billion fund @entity35 established to assist victims of the disaster			0
" this guy sounds like @entity35 all the way , " said @entity120 , who did n't like what he said was @entity162 's suggestion to fishermen that it 's best they take $ 100,000 now instead of trying to sue			0
" he 's detached , " @entity124 chimed in			0
it 's clear that frustration is running high , and whether it 's @entity35 , gov. @entity176 or president @entity155 , residents here are in unanimous agreement : they can do more , and it needs to be done now			0
one fisherman said that @entity23 is their home and they want to see it thrive , but things are reaching a boiling point			0
" what do we have to do ? wreak havoc down here to get people 's attention because that 's what it 's coming to			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			2

@entity192 : residents of small rural town totally *dependent* on fishing industry
he says their way of life is *threatened* by the @entity48 oil disaster
@entity192 : stress is intense and people are getting frustrated by pace of cleanup effort
