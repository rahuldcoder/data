it 's been a turbulent start to 2015 for leading @entity4 club @entity3 as it sacked director of football @entity5 , while @entity7 decided to step down from his assistant sporting director role			1
@entity5 's dismissal follows sunday 's disappointing 1 - 0 @entity11 defeat to @entity12 and the news last tuesday that the club had lost its appeal to the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) following the decision to ban it from being able to sign new players over the next 12 months			1
a former goalkeeper for the club , @entity5 had been responsible for @entity3 's transfer business since returning to the @entity22 in july 2010			1
" the @entity3 president @entity23 has decided to terminate as of today the contract of the @entity26 's director of football , @entity5 , " an official @entity3 statement read			1
" @entity28 , thanks @entity5 for his contribution , dedication and professionalism over the last four years in his role at the head of the @entity26 's football area			2
" @entity35 was n't the only leading figure at @entity3 to leave the club monday after @entity7 confirmed on his @entity39 page that he would also be departing			1
a former captain of the club , who won three @entity43 crowns and six @entity11 titles , @entity7 was appointed assistant sporting director soon after retiring as a player in may			1
" these last three months gave me the opportunity to see the other side of the club			0
i learned a lot , i am very grateful and , now , i want to try other things from another perspective and in other places , " @entity7 wrote			2
" i want to grow both personally and professionally so that , in the future , i can return to this home and give back all that you gave me during these unforgettable years			0
" i remain extremely grateful to the employees , directors , president and sports management for trusting me and for helping me in this transition that was not easy			0
" and most of all to the fans who , if i felt they were supportive when i played , now , since my retirement , i feel that even more			0
" i wish i could have said good bye to everyone with my boots on , but life does not always goes as one desires			0
i have been and i am very fortunate too feel as much love and support , for which i can only say @entity77 and let you know that i will always carry you in my heart			0
" @entity16 's decision , which found @entity3 guilty of breaching @entity82 rules on signing minors , means the club is unable to add to its squad during the next two transfer windows			1
the @entity4 club , also hit with a $ 455,000 fine , says the transfer ban is " disproportionate " and " excessive			1
" after @entity3 's loss to @entity12 -- a result which meant it missed the chance to move top of the @entity11 table -- @entity5 suggested in an interview with @entity95 + that he was not solely to blame for the transfer ban			1
" taking responsibility is to explain the actions , how the decisions were made , but i have little to explain because the vice-president [ @entity23 ] who was in charge of that area [ at the time ] is the current president , " he said			0
@entity82 first issued the ban in april , but with @entity3 appealing the decision it was free to buy players until that appeal was then rejected by world football 's governing body in august			1
@entity5 helped to bring @entity110 to the club from @entity112 in the summer , which was met with much excitement from supporters , yet other signings have not been met with such acclaim			2
@entity117 was signed from @entity118 but has only made three appearances this season , while @entity120 has yet to make his debut for the club since joining from @entity123 due to injury			0
@entity5 also helped sign the likes of @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , who have all proved relative successes			0
@entity130 's transfer , however , cast a shadow over @entity3 , with @entity4 's authorities accusing the club of tax fraud			2
@entity5 played for @entity3 between 1986 and 1994 , helping the side to a first ever @entity43 in 1992			2
the @entity4 club is yet to announce who will fill the vacancy left by the 53 - year - old .			0
