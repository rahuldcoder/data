-- just how reliant are you on the @entity2 ? more women would give up sex rather than go without internet access , according to a new survey			1
nearly half of the women questioned by @entity9 said they 'd be willing to forgo sex for two weeks , rather than give up their internet access , according to a study released monday by @entity13 , which commissioned the survey			1
while 46 percent of the women surveyed were willing to engage in abstinence versus losing their @entity2 , only 30 percent of the men surveyed were willing to do likewise			2
the @entity20 survey , which queried 2,119 adults last month , found that the gap grew even wider for both men and woman who were 18 to 34 years old			1
for woman , the percentage of those willing to skip the sheets in favor of the @entity29 rose to 49 percent , while it climbed to 39 percent for men			0
and for women 35 to 44 years old , the figure jumped to 52 percent			0
( results as of monday from @entity0 's related online poll showed that 30.5 percent of respondents would give up sex for one year , while 26.1 percent would do without internet access for a year			1
almost 40 percent of voters did n't want to sacrifice either			0
) these figures were just some of the tidbits that came out of the @entity13 's broader commissioned study on @entity20 ' reliance on the internet in today 's economy			1
though not as sexy but equally interesting , the survey also found that 87 percent of respondents said the @entity2 saves them money			2
specifically , 84 percent of those surveyed found the @entity2 saved them money by comparing prices online and searching out the best deals , while 65 percent said it aided them in finding coupons , discounts , and special promotions			0
and tv , which has been losing its share of eyeball time to the internet over the years , found that the majority of adults would be willing to forgo two weeks of watching tv versus losing one week on the @entity2			1
of course when it comes to tv , perhaps size matters , at least according to a different survey earlier this year of @entity68 conducted by electronics retailer @entity69			2
almost half of the men polled said they would give up sex for six months in return for a 50 - inch plasma tv , according to @entity75			2
that compared with just over a third of women who were willing to make the same sacrifice for the big - screen television			0
