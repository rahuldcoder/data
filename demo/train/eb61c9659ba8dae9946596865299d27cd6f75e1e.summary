@entity3 , who has been president since 1999 , defeated @entity10 , whose campaign criticized the @entity3 administration for inefficiencies , infrastructure shortcomings and corruption			1
@entity3 highlighted his accomplishments in housing , education and health initiatives and acknowledged he needed to do more on crime and government bureaucracy			1
with 90 % of the ballots counted sunday night , @entity3 has 54.42 % of the vote compared with 44.97 % for @entity10 , according to @entity24 , president of the @entity25			1

the country saw one of its highest participation rates in decades , with almost 81 % of voters going to the polls , @entity24 said			1
in fact , some polls were kept open two hours after their scheduled closing because lines of voters were waiting for ballots			2
as throughout the day , the army was still deployed sunday evening and was standing by throughout the country to ensure a peaceful and secure vote , said maj. gen. @entity43 , commander of strategic operations command			2
earlier in the evening , @entity3 thanked his campaign staff in a phone call aired on state - run television at mid-evening and asked people to remain calm until the election results were completed			1
@entity3 said people were still voting in some places			1
" let us wait for the results patiently , calmly and prepare ourselves to accept the results whatever they may be , " he said			0
" this will be a triumph for democracy , " he added			0
he asked that there be no violence			0
long lines began forming in the early morning hours at polling stations from remote regions of the @entity65 to the bustling capital of @entity0			0
one election official , @entity67 , told state - run television that polling stations in the municipality of @entity71 in the state of @entity73 would remain open past the schedule closing time -- " until the last elector casts his vote			1
" nearly 140,000 troops were deployed throughout the country to guard polls and keep the peace , state - run @entity77 reported			2

" it wo n't be the end of the world for anybody , " he said			0
@entity3 has dismissed his much younger challenger as a " fly " not worth chasing , when challenged to a debate earlier this year			1
the president 's critics were confident that @entity10 could unseat the long - ruling leftist leader , a refrain previously heard before eventual defeats			1
yet the incumbent is a political survivor and remains popular at home			0
but there were signals , observers said , that this time @entity3 really was on the ropes			1
@entity3 's influence over @entity145 's left - leaning governments has often rankled the @entity146 , @entity1 's largest trading partner			1
@entity1 is the fourth - largest exporter of oil to the @entity146			2
despite that tight economic relationship , the two countries are not exactly close allies : @entity3 often rails against the @entity146 and its allies as " imperialists			1
" further complicating the @entity146 - @entity1 relationship is how @entity3 is allied with @entity156 's @entity155 , defended former @entity158 leader @entity157 and has even offered his support for @entity161 's leader @entity160			1
at stake for @entity1 is the ideological trajectory of their country			0
@entity3 , 58 , has had more than a decade to implement his vision of 21st century socialism , a view that emphasizes use of state oil windfalls to fund social programs			2
observers say @entity10 , 40 , represents a moderate alternative			2
he has vowed not to end the social programs that @entity3 has set up , and he promises to fight corruption that has grown in the public sector			2
the candidates offer two distinct paths to solve the problems that are on @entity1 minds : decaying infrastructure , high crime rates and political polarization			0
the election also drew voters from beyond the country 's borders as thousands of @entity1 living abroad lined up to cast their ballots at diplomatic offices			2
in @entity191 , @entity190 , voters streamed into the @entity1 consulate			0
many traveled by bus from @entity194 , where @entity1 authorities closed a consulate in january after the @entity146 expelled the office 's top @entity1 diplomat			0
in @entity0 , voters said they were happy to be casting their ballots			2
" i 'm really proud of the people , because everyone is cheerful about this event and i think there is a good feeling , " said @entity200 , a 25 - year - old student			1
standing outside the @entity0 school where @entity3 cast his ballot , @entity206 said she hoped @entity1 would respect the results			2
" for now , everything is quiet here , and we want that after the results are announced , that people remain calm , " she said			0
