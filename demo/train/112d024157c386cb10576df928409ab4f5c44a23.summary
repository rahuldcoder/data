@entity0 -- as @entity3 has cemented its position as the default language of global business , @entity3 interest in foreign languages has steadily waned			1
" we have taken a perverse pride in the fact that we do not speak foreign languages , and we just need to speak louder in @entity3 , " @entity9 education secretary @entity8 lamented to a newspaper last week			1
his government hopes to reverse a decline in the number of @entity9 students sitting a language gcse - a drop from 444,700 to 273,000 over 12 years - by teaching foreign languages from the age of five			2
but how much do measures like this stand to benefit @entity3 speakers , given the dominance of their language ? to an aspiring executive from an @entity3 speaking background , does it make sense to spend time acquiring another language when the world is learning yours ? or would you be wiser investing that time in other areas of your career instead ? @entity38 , director of the mba degree at @entity41 's @entity40 — d @entity42 , said while speaking @entity3 was " almost a precondition for success " for non-native speakers , a second language was not essential to @entity3 speakers			1
" but if the question is : ' is learning a second language an advantage , and is that advantage going to increase ? ' the answer 's got to be yes , " he said			2
" almost certainly , as the balance of economic power shifts , and as supply chains , sales and deals start happening outside of traditionally the most influential markets			0
" which languages ? @entity59 , director of the @entity61 's @entity60 , said the opportunities presented by emerging @entity64 economies and @entity65 were making their languages particularly attractive to businesses and students - especially as @entity69 and @entity71 struggle			0
in particular , @entity72 ( the world 's most spoken language ) and @entity75 ( by varying accounts the second - or third-most spoken ) are " beginning to be more important for all of business			1
" employees with a portfolio of languages were valued for their ability to build partnerships , and had an advantage in the job market for relationship - focused roles , from deal - making to supply chain development			0
" but that 's a difficult message to get across , because of the perception that @entity3 is the global language , and therefore enough , " says @entity59			1
she frequently sees multilingual @entity69 edging out similarly qualified but monolingual @entity9 for jobs in the @entity9			0
recent trends in the ever - expanding language tuition market reflect @entity3 's strengthening position as the default language of international business			1
" the key growing markets for language training are @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , and people in these markets are learning @entity3 , " said @entity95 , director of global marketing for language tuition company @entity97 , which has roughly doubled its number of students to 300,000 in 70 countries over the past decade			1
during that time , @entity3 rose from 64 % to 72 % of their business , while @entity110 and @entity111 remained stable at 6.5 % each , and @entity75 at 4 %			1
the only other language to have increased significantly was @entity72 , doubling to 2 %			2
while the @entity104 economic success story has propelled interest in @entity72 in schools around the world , the language can appear forbidding - even impenetrable - for those who encounter it in adulthood			2
not so , says dr @entity121 , lecturer in @entity104 business studies at @entity40 — d @entity42 , who picked up the language from scratch during 18 months of intensive immersion study in his mid- 20s			1
" most people thought i was crazy , " he said , adding that devoting yourself exclusively to language acquisition was the only real way to make inroads			2
" it 's hard to do as a side pursuit			0
" but while you might have to temporarily put your career on hold to pick up a language , the trade - off was likely to be worth it in the long run			1
a language could be an invaluable asset by allowing you to better understand your market and access broader sources of information , said @entity121			2
@entity72 was now as imperative to business success in @entity104 as @entity3 was in the @entity146			1
and , as @entity104 had developed into " a more normal labor market " , language skill was no longer a key to success in itself - a functional specialty was generally needed also			0
" fifteen years ago a foreigner going to @entity104 would have a fairly strong advantage just because there was n't a particularly deep talent pool , " he said			0
" that 's completely different now			0
the bar is much higher			0
" finally , though , it 's important to remember that attempting to pick up a language for business purposes alone may prove a shortsighted approach			1
the usefulness of a language in a business sense would rise and fall with unpredictable shifts in the global economy , said @entity59			1
" when i was growing up it never occurred to us to learn @entity104			0
we were focusing on the languages of @entity69 , because @entity69 was our reality			0
during anybody 's lifetime those contexts will change			0
" beyond its business applications , however , language acquisition would always have a deeper benefit in enabling the learner to grasp another worldview , and become a more effective communicator in any tongue			2
" the more respectful you are of the subtleties of language , the more effective you are as a negotiator or as a manager , " said @entity182			0
" and the more likely you are to be able to take people with you in your projects			0

@entity3 is cementing its position as the language of business
a second language , however , will assist in *furthering* your career
putting your career on hold to learn a language is likely to pay off in the long run
