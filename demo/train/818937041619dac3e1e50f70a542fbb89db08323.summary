-- now that warmer spring sunshine is bathing the streets of @entity3 , the charred remains from the attacks on the central city are far more evident			0
the sunshine is also warming up debate on the future of the downtown core , which has served since last november as the heart of the protest against the regime of deposed @entity15 president @entity14			1
this weekend @entity15 will mark the end of the traditional 40 days of mourning for the at least 100 protesters that were mowed down by sniper , grenade and other live fire during and around february 20			1
until now , the area around the main square , where the attacks took place , has served as a massive memorial -- framed by mountains of flowers , drawings , photos , candles and poems			0
earlier this week a group of men were preparing to build a permanent chapel behind the @entity37 , one of the vantage points for snipers and a makeshift emergency clinic during the february 20 shootings			0

on any given morning activists line up at soup kitchens			0
protesters from far flung regions show no sign of going home and appear dug in for a prolonged stay			2
at the far end of the encampment , a commandeered militia water canon truck serves as a gigantic trophy ( and makeshift barricade ) for the people 's victory over government forces			1
the conventional thinking is that the protest movement will stay well after the scheduled may 25 presidential elections -- longer if they go into a second , run - off round			1
' medieval village ' while the passion and commitment of this open display of raw people power is impressive , there are those , including retailers and city center residents , who would like to see the protest site shrunk to a few small blocks			2
one @entity80 journalist said derisively last week that the @entity43 , with its soot - covered tents , tattered residents , and crude , rusting barricades , resembles a " medieval village			2
" and one nearby resident told me that she and others are fed up with the traffic snarls caused by the sprawling encampment			0
but there is more to @entity43 than just the physical presence of tents and hardened protesters			1
it has served as a stage to mint new popular leaders -- such as @entity98 , 26 , a student activist from @entity99 who stood up on the @entity43 stage on feb 21 and threatened @entity14 with an armed overthrow			2
it was also the very same stage taken briefly by former prime minister and presidential candidate @entity104 on february 22 , shortly after her release from prison -- a humiliating appearance which showed how terribly out of sync she had fallen with the street after three years behind bars			0
@entity111 , a volunteer doctor ( and also presidential candidate ) who treated many injured protesters on february 20 , suggested thursday that the @entity43 is one huge , open - air crime scene and that international forensic experts have yet to make an appearance to collect evidence			1
in fact one of the most popular displays is a collection of organ - piercing bullets , grenade shells and other lethal projectiles fired at protesters by the now - disbanded @entity125 forces in february			0
another face of @entity43 , the immensely popular @entity128 star @entity127 , insists that the protest site must stay put as a kind of check and balance on the new interim government -- and as a psychological barricade to @entity136 president @entity135			1
" i believe that even today that same @entity43 has a critical role to play in stopping @entity135			1
while @entity43 still exists , nothing will work out for @entity135			1
" voice of @entity15 street there 's little doubt that @entity43 represents the voice of the @entity15 street : after the excesses of the @entity14 government and the failed promises of the administration of the @entity151 @entity150 , public trust in public officials is at an all - time low			1
@entity152 , a protester from a small town near @entity3 , says he has been at @entity43 since january after unidentified men took away his credit union business			2
until the people have had a chance to vote in a new president , many protest leaders will continue to see themselves as the guardians of the people , almost to the point that they have veto power over major decisions			0
hence there is believed to be a large arms cache on site -- most arms hidden away but some proudly worn by self - appointed self - defense forces who man the various entrances to the @entity43			0
the huge stage has become a forum for leaders to swing out at bad decisions , or simply to take swipes at @entity135 for his brazen land grab of @entity178			0
when there are no speakers , a giant screen streams live sessions of the @entity183 or the newly - found independent tv channels that themselves symbolize the @entity186 era			0
it is not a stretch in the least to say that there 's probably no one more eager to see @entity43 disappear than @entity135 , whose pliant media machine has painted the movement as nothing more than right - wing @entity194 , fascists and terrorists			1
that 's probably why the protest leaders have been so careful to protect the semblance of order from provocateurs or stop any violent outbreaks			0
sadly , @entity43 could figure into @entity135 's twisted logic for moving his armed forces as far inland as @entity3 should he decide to invade more of @entity15			1
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			0

this weekend , @entity15 mark the end of 40 days mourning for those killed in @entity43 square
at least 100 people died when *anti-government* protesters *clashed* with riot *police*
@entity207 says the protest movement will stay in @entity43 beyond elections in may
but he says organizers have *prevented* any violence in case it factors into @entity135 's plans
