building his own dreams : @entity9 has turned @entity1 into an international company in less than 15 years			1
@entity9 's hands - on approach to running a business with 130,000 employees -- he still eats in the company canteen and lives in a @entity1 - owned housing complex -- is n't too far removed from how he built the company from scratch in 1995 when he was 29 years old			1

@entity1 's business approach differed from the likes of @entity35 and @entity36 by substituting an automated system for one of @entity7 's biggest resources , physical labor			2
employing thousands of people was cheaper than installing expensive robotic assembly lines , and by 2000 @entity1 had become the biggest mobile phone battery maker in the world			1
@entity9 bought a failing @entity7 car company in 2003 to enter the automobile market , and @entity1 now has a number of models available in @entity7 , including a plug - hybrid car cheaper than the market - leading @entity50			1

so maybe @entity7 can exceed the @entity59 and become the biggest market in the world , " @entity9 told @entity0			2
@entity1 stands for " @entity1 " and @entity9 is trying to fulfill the aspiration among many in @entity7 of creating a national champion ; a brand with international respect and reputation of quality			1
@entity9 believes the electric car can be that product , and byd the company to do it			1
" for new energy vehicles ... @entity7 is on the same level or even leading other countries			0
in the field of new energy cars , @entity7 hopes that @entity7 companies can catch up with the rest of the world and catch up with the pace , " said @entity9			2
but the term " @entity96 " still has a stigma attached to it			0
the scandals of tainted milk and toys that had to be recalled rocked @entity7 in 2008 and diminished the reputation of @entity7 products abroad			0
" this kind of ' @entity96 ' is different from other types of ' made in @entity7			0

judging from that , products made in @entity7 are sometimes better that those made elsewhere			0
as long as there are high - standards , @entity7 manufacturing companies can definitely meet those standards , " said @entity9			2
@entity7 also has acute environmental problems			0
it is the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and @entity9 is aware that being an entrepreneur also means having an eye on the environmental impact of his business			2
" as an entrepreneur , i think i have to consider both aspects			0
one part is the creation of a new business mode , or the revelation of new business competition			0
the other is that it 's for social responsibility , making our @entity134 bluer			0
