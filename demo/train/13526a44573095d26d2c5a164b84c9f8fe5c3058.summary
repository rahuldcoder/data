-- sometimes the hardest thing is to say " no " to a friend			2
all the more reason to applaud the bravery of @entity5 and the @entity6			0
a few months ago , the @entity7 accepted a $ 25 million grant from @entity9 and @entity10 to support scholarships for minority students			1
it raised more than a few eyebrows			0
after all , everyone -- including me -- reveres the college fund			1
its contribution to the cause of equal opportunity is legendary			0
but few people still alive have done more to promote policies that hurt african - americans than the @entity10 brothers			1
the @entity10 brothers are one of the most prominent funders of organizations that work to restrict early voting and registration and effectively disenfranchise african - americans			1
they oppose the minimum wage , which would disproportionately help black workers			0
they are spending millions to lie to the public about climate disruption , which hurts the most vulnerable communities first			0
in other words , the @entity25 ' agenda is great for african - americans -- so long as we do not want to vote , make a living or avoid our homes being swept away in a flood			1
it is one thing to accept money from dubious sources			0
one could argue -- convincingly -- that the college fund was taking money from a bad source and doing something good with it			1
but the breaking point came a few weeks ago when @entity7 president @entity54 appeared at a @entity10 brothers ' retreat in @entity57			1
the public stated purpose of this event was to build support for the @entity25 ' various political causes			0
the moment he stepped through the door , @entity62 lent the his organization 's good name to a radical agenda that causes untold damage to african - americans			1
all this was too much for @entity6 , a predominantly @entity73 - @entity72 union with a long civil rights track record that had partnered with the @entity7 for years in giving out scholarships			1
last month , @entity5 sent @entity62 a letter ending their partnership			0
it was a tough decision , no doubt -- but it was the right one			0
( full disclosure : @entity6 once made a donation to @entity85 , an organization that i lead			0
) i am all for education			0
that is one of the reasons i helped start # @entity91 , an initiative to teach computer science to black , brown and low - income young people			2
i am the first to point out how much brilliance and creativity our nation is losing by failing to uplift youth from low - opportunity backgrounds			2
that 's why i am usually such a huge fan of the @entity7			1
but the @entity10 money seems to have come with strings attached			1
the funds are earmarked only for young people with " an interest in the study of how entrepreneurship , economics , and innovation contribute to well - being for individuals , communities , and society			2
" to many , that sounds like the @entity10 brothers are restricting the funds only to students who adopt the @entity10 's economic and political views			1
@entity10 representatives will even help choose which students qualify for scholarships			1
it is also worth noting that @entity6 did not end its support for minority scholarships			2
the union will still give just as much money to young scholars as it always has -- just through other channels			2
it is simply choosing not to partner with a group that is lending a helping hand to those whose political views most african - americans detest			1
after all , according to documents reported by @entity138 and the @entity139 , @entity140 was once a member of the @entity142 , the far - right group that so opposed the civil rights movement that it declared the rev. @entity144 a communist			2
and that one of the speakers at the @entity10 retreat was @entity149 of the notorious " @entity150 , " a book he co-authored that argued blacks and @entity153 were innately less intelligent than whites and @entity155 , and to blame for every social injustice they face			1
endorsing these views in exchange for scholarship funding is not worth it			0
it is not two steps forward , one step back			0
it is half a step forward , then go sit in the back of the bus			0
@entity62 and the @entity7 may not agree			2
conservatives definitely do not -- @entity168 tactfully likened the college fund to slaves and @entity6 to slaveholders			1
but @entity6 has an obligation to its members not to align itself with this kind of behavior			0
it is harder to say " no " to a friend than an enemy			0
but in this case , the hard path was also the right one .			0

the @entity7 accepted $ 25 million from @entity10 brothers to use for scholarships
@entity187 : @entity10 brothers fund , promote policies *destructive* to african - americans
union that worked with @entity7 decided to break ties as a result
@entity187 agrees with union , says college fund chief going to @entity10 retreat was wrong
