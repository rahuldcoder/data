@entity0 -- a video released by an @entity4 human rights organization shows what the group describes as a 9 - year - old @entity8 boy being assaulted by two border police officers in the @entity11 city of @entity12			1
the footage , released by @entity14 , the @entity15 in the @entity16 , shows the boy walking on pavement outside a building when a uniformed police officer runs up to him and grabs him by an arm , causing him to lose his balance and pulling him along the ground for a few feet			1
the police officer , who is holding a rifle in one hand , asks the boy , " why are you making trouble ? " according to @entity14			1
seconds later , a second police officer , also carrying a rifle , walks up to the boy , kicks him , turns around and walks off without speaking			1
at that , the first policeman releases the boy , who runs out of the frame			0
in response to the video , @entity4 border police issued a statement saying , " @entity38 denounces the policemen 's behaviour , which contrasts the values of the force			1
it is important to note that this is a rare incident which does not represent the actions of the @entity38 in @entity4			1
the @entity38 commander instructed on setting up a team to investigate the incident immediately and its conclusions are due in the coming days			1
" @entity14 says on its website that the video was shot by a volunteer in @entity14 's camera distribution project from inside his home near the @entity55			0
it says he began to shoot the video when he saw the officer hiding behind a wall			2
the boy was identified by his father , @entity60 , as @entity61			0
it was a " very sad and disgusting attack , " the elder @entity60 told @entity1			0
" you do n't expect such unethical behavior from an officer who considers himself to be providing security and law and order			0
" " this is animalistic and vicious behavior , " he said about the video , two minutes of which were posted on @entity71			0
the posting says the video was shot june 29			0
an investigation should be opened into the incident , said @entity76 , a spokeswoman for @entity14			0
" from the video evidence and from evidence collected from the child , it 's obvious the border police officer was basically waiting for him and grabbed him and another border police officer came and kicked the child , " she said			1
" the child denies attacking or harassing the border police officer			1
regardless , this is irrelevant as far as @entity88 is concerned , because this kind of behavior is absolutely prohibited regardless of the circumstance			0
" she continued , " this kind of violence by border police officers , by official members of the @entity4 security forces is outrageous and not allowed			1
@entity88 is going to complain with the department of police investigations in the @entity100 , which is a relevant government investigative body of allegations against the border police			1
" @entity76 said the boy had been treated similarly before			0
" a month ago he was attacked by border police officers on his way back from school , " she said			1
the incident occurred a few days after a team of human rights lawyers published a report funded by the @entity114 government that accuses @entity4 of violating international law in its treatment of @entity8 child detainees			1
it was written after a week - long visit last september by the delegation to @entity4 and the @entity11			2
the report accuses @entity4 of treating @entity8 and @entity4 children differently -- @entity4 must be at least 14 before they can be sent to jail ; palestinians must be 12			2
@entity4 children generally have a legal right to have their parents present during questioning ; @entity8 do not , it says			2
an @entity4 child can be held no more than two days without being granted access to a lawyer ; a @entity8 child can be held 90 days , it says			2
" it may be that much of the reluctance to treat @entity8 children in conformity with international norms stems from a belief , which was advanced to us by a military prosecutor , that every @entity8 child is a ' potential terrorist , ' the report says			0
" such a stance seems to us to be the starting point of a spiral of injustice , and one which only @entity4 , as the @entity16 in the @entity11 , can reverse			2
" the @entity147 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
but @entity150 , the spokesman for @entity4 prime minister @entity151 , told " @entity155 " newspaper of @entity153 , @entity154 , that @entity4 was studying the report 's proposals			2
" the report acknowledges that @entity4 has made improvements and they have praised us for that , " @entity150 said			0
" you have countless acts of violence , including deadly violence , perpetrated by minors -- @entity4 is acting because of a vacuum created by a lack of action from the @entity8 leadership and by the exploitation of minors by the extremist groups			0
