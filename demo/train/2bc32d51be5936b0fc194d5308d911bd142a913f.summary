-- international regulators need to rethink their procedures for handling nuclear accidents in the wake of the crisis in @entity9 , the head of the @entity3 atomic watchdog agency said monday			1
the current framework for responding to emergencies dates back to the aftermath of the @entity16 accident in 1986 and " reflects the realities of the 1980s , not of the 21st century , " @entity11 chief @entity10 said			1
" the speed at which information now travels and the huge volume of information in public circulation are among the most significant changes since then , " @entity10 said			0
" live television and the internet provide constant updates on a crisis situation -- not always accurately -- to a global audience			0
the responsibility of the @entity11 is to provide authoritative and validated information as quickly as possible , but doing this under the current arrangements inevitably takes time and has limitations			1
" @entity10 said the first priority remains cooling down the damaged reactors at the earthquake - and tsunami - battered @entity40 nuclear power plant			0
but he said authorities should move to revise their playbooks for similar crises " in a reasonable amount of time , " and an april conference on nuclear safety would be a good opportunity to start			0
@entity10 , the @entity11 director - general , briefed the agency 's governing board in @entity51 after a trip back to his native @entity9			1
during that visit , he pressed prime minister @entity54 to provide more information on conditions at @entity40 , where three of the six reactors may have suffered core damage since the march 11 earthquake that struck northern @entity9			1
@entity9 's government and the @entity61 , which owns the damaged plant , have been criticized for failing to share information about conditions there fully and promptly			1
in @entity68 , the head of the @entity67 said information coming out of @entity9 " is sometimes conflicting , and certainly is n't at the level that any engineer would like to have to do a thorough analysis			2
" " i do n't believe we have anywhere near a clear understanding of what the plant conditions are like within the reactor building -- what kinds of electrical cabling has been damaged , what kinds of pumps and valves remain operable is a significant unknown right now , " @entity67 chairman @entity73 , whose agency has sent specialists to @entity9 to assist with the effort , said monday			2
@entity10 told reporters monday that information coming from @entity89 now is " more extensive , " and that damaged instruments at the plant may have prevented @entity61 or @entity9 regulators from having all the facts			2
however , when asked whether the response to the accident was quick enough , he said it was " difficult to say			0
" " we had the information			0
but i personally think understanding the context was not that easy , and that was one of the reasons i went there , " @entity10 said .			0

current procedures were developed after @entity16 , the @entity11 's chief says
those plans reflect " the realities of the 1980s , not the 21st century , " he says
he urges the release of more information about the @entity9 situation
