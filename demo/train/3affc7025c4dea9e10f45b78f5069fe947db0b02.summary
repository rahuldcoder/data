-- " @entity1 's " new winner has put @entity3 on the scoreboard			1
on tuesday night 's " @entity1 " finale , the @entity7 singer 's mentee , @entity8 , was crowned the winner of @entity11			1
@entity13 's victory came in spite of a technical glitch that made it difficult for fans to show their support of him on @entity20 , where his performance from monday night 's show was available for download			1
" @entity1 " lets its viewers vote for their favorite singer through phone , e-mail , text and by downloading songs from the show on @entity20			0
however , as @entity13 warned his fans on @entity35 , his cover of @entity37 's " @entity38 " from monday 's show was n't showing up where viewers expected			2
as a result , " @entity1 " host @entity41 said at the start of tuesday 's finale that all of the @entity20 downloads from monday night 's show were being tossed out , but the glitch did n't impact the final results			2
@entity13 was up against @entity50 , the @entity52 singer who came in third , and @entity53 from @entity54 , who placed second			1
for the first time , neither @entity52 nor @entity54 could boast coaching the season 's winner , as @entity13 sealed the championship for @entity3			1
( although , to be fair , @entity13 was on @entity52 's team first			2
) @entity13 was at the top of his game during the finale , as he performed a duet with @entity66			0
the pair of soulful crooners did a rendition of @entity66 's new song , " @entity71			0
" and with this being " @entity1 , " that was ( obviously ) far from the only performance			0
the two - hour season closer was packed with guest stars , and featured sets from @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
in the fall , " @entity1 " will be joined by two new coaches , @entity83 and @entity84 , who will sit alongside mainstays @entity52 and @entity54 .			0

" @entity1 " crowned @entity8 as the winner of @entity11
he beat out @entity50 and @entity53
@entity13 's win was the first for @entity3
