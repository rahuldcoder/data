@entity0 -- you want close ? we 've got close ! seven of the eight national polls released since sunday indicate the race for the @entity6 is in a dead heat , like most have shown for weeks			1
more importantly , it 's a similar story in the key battleground states that will decide whether president @entity10 or @entity12 nominee @entity11 will be victorious on tuesday			1
according to the final @entity1 / @entity16 poll released before the election on sunday night , 49 % of likely voters questioned in the survey say they support the president , with an equal amount saying they back the former @entity22 governor			2
what to watch for but it 's not just the horse - race numbers that show how equally divided @entity27 voters are over the two candidates			1
according to the @entity1 poll , the president 's favorable rating stands at 52 % in the poll , with @entity11 at 51 % ; 51 % say they agree with @entity10 on important issues and 50 % say the same thing about @entity11 ; 56 % say that @entity10 has the personal qualities a president should have , with 55 % feeling the same about the @entity12 nominee			1
does either party have an edge on enthusiasm ? " the @entity1 survey indicates the answer is no. seventy percent of registered voters who describe themselves as @entity46 say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting , with an equal amount of self - described republicans saying the same thing , " said @entity1 polling director @entity42			2
margin of error : two candidates , two journeys , one race of lost dreams and the survey indicated that 49 % say they will vote for the @entity12 candidate for @entity59 in their district ; with 48 % saying they will choose the @entity62			1
that 's where the similarities end			0
there are also some stark differences			0
when it comes to the racial breakdown , 40 % of white voters questioned in the @entity1 poll said they are supporting @entity10 , with 57 % backing @entity11			1
the vote by race could be crucial to determining which candidate wins the @entity6			0
" the formula for victory for @entity10 is to win at least 80 % of minorities and around 40 % of whites , if minorities represent the 26 % of voters that they constituted last time , " said @entity75 and national journal editorial director @entity76			1
poll of polls : margin is thin in @entity87 , @entity88 " the final wave of public polls all show @entity10 running right around that tipping point , among both whites and minorities , which means nothing looms larger than the racial composition of the electorate			1
" @entity10 obviously benefits if the minority share of the vote increases even by a point or two			2
the flip side is that if the minority share declines at all , the math gets better for the @entity12 challenger			0
" and if it remains unchanged , we 're on the knife 's edge , " @entity76 added			0
" but just remember , the minority share of the vote has increased , and the white share has decreased , in every presidential election since 1992			0
just holding the minority share steady , much less seeing it decline , will require a huge turnout among older and conservative whites , which is the last hope for republicans looking at most public polls showing @entity10 holding a narrow , but steady , edge , especially in the battleground states			1
" @entity119 : @entity121 a close contest on eve of election the @entity1 poll was one of seven national nonpartisan , live operator surveys released sunday and monday to indicate the battle for the presidency either a dead heat or virtually tied			1
a @entity133 / @entity132 survey has it tied at 48 % ; an @entity136 / @entity135 poll indicates @entity10 at 48 % and @entity11 at 47 % ; the latest @entity139 / @entity138 tracking poll puts @entity10 at 49 % and @entity11 at 48 % ; @entity141 's latest daily tracking poll had @entity11 at 49 % and @entity10 at 48 % ; @entity142 had it deadlocked at 49 % and @entity143 had it all tied upat 48 %			1
a @entity145 survey released sunday indicates the president at 50 % and the @entity12 challenger at 47 % , which is within the survey 's sampling error			0
while the national polls are revealing , the battleground state surveys are what matter most , since the race for the @entity6 is a battle for electoral votes			1
and it 's the eight swing states that will end up determining which candidate comes out on top on tuesday			0
of all the toss - up states , @entity121 and it 's 18 electoral votes has gotten the most attention because many scenarios see the election being decided there			2
both the president and the former @entity22 governor hold campaign rallies in @entity170 , the state 's capital , on monday , the final day of campaigning			0
provisional ballots could be key if @entity121 margin razor thin a new @entity119 compiled and released monday show @entity10 at 50 % and @entity11 at 47 % among likely voters in the @entity121			1
the @entity119 is an average of three @entity121 polls of likely voters conducted in the last week : @entity179 / @entity180 ; @entity1 / @entity16 and @entity136 / @entity135 / @entity181			2
the poll of polls does not have a sampling error			0
@entity185 , where 29 electoral votes are up for grabs , is also getting outsized attention and two polls released on friday tell very different stories			0
an @entity136 / @entity135 / @entity181 survey gave the president a razor - thin 49 % -47 % edge , within the poll 's sampling error			1
but a @entity197 survey conducted for many of the @entity185 's major newspapers indicated @entity200 ahead 51 % -45 %			0
four years ago @entity10 become the first @entity62 to capture @entity201 in a presidential election since 1964			2
the battle for the state 's 13 electoral votes appears to be extremely close this time around			0
an @entity136 / @entity135 / @entity181 survey released early monday morning indicated @entity10 at 48 % and @entity11 at 47 %			1
the president closes his campaign on monday night in @entity88			0
then - sen. @entity10 's victory in the 2008 @entity88 @entity46 caucuses launched him towards the @entity6			1
the @entity88 is also a general election battleground , and a new @entity119 that averages all three non-partisan , live operator surveys conducted over the past week indicates @entity10 with a 48 % -45 % edge			1
@entity11 closes his campaign monday night in @entity87 , the state were he officially launched his bid for the @entity6 nearly a year and a half ago			2
besides holding the first in the nation primary , the @entity87 is also a general election battleground , and a new @entity119 that averages all three non-partisan , live operator surveys conducted over the past week indicates @entity10 with a 50 % -38 % edge			1
in the two @entity225 battlegrounds , the most recent polls in @entity223 ( by @entity1 / @entity16 and @entity142 ) indicated the race all knotted up			2
and in @entity228 , an @entity136 / @entity135 / @entity181 survey indicated the president with the edge and an @entity142 poll gave @entity11 a slight advantage			2
the only state where the president appears to have a solid single digit advantage according to public opinion polls is @entity237 , home to @entity12 running mate rep. @entity239			0
a @entity1 @entity119 of the three most recent surveys indicates the president with a seven point advantage in @entity237			0
of course the only numbers that really matter are the numbers we 'll get on tuesday			0
@entity11 breaks tradition with @entity247 campaigning			0
