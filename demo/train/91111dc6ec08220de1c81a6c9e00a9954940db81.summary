@entity0 -- @entity2 went beyond the edge of the fiscal cliff to get a deal done in back - to - back , late - night sessions to avert a financial crisis , or at least to put it off for a couple months			1
here are winners and losers in the deal : winners vice president @entity13 : this might not have been the " big f * * * ing deal " that he proclaimed the passage of @entity19 to be , but it was a pretty big deal			1
@entity13 used his years of experience cutting deals in the @entity22 to work out a compromise with @entity22 minority leader @entity24			1
he used the same playbook in the first extension of the @entity28 - era tax cuts in 2010 and the debt ceiling fight in 2011 , walking through the proposal with progressives in the @entity22 and then the @entity32 to bring them in line			0
then he went and got a sandwich			0
@entity13 has n't ruled out a run for the @entity32 when @entity37 's second term is up and his role in this deal makes a president @entity13 believable			1
senate minority leader @entity24 : he found the " dance partner " he was looking for in @entity13 and skillfully worked behind the scenes with the vice president to broker a deal that got overwhelming @entity45 support in the @entity22			1
it 's too early to tell whether @entity48 will pay the price with hard - line conservatives at home in @entity52 who have already shown that they can oust @entity22 incumbents who anger them by working with @entity54			2
no real @entity45 opponent has emerged in his re-election race in 2014 but they mobilized two years ago to elect @entity58 to the @entity22 over @entity48 's hand - picked candidate			1
inside the deal president @entity37 : @entity32 insiders say he learned lessons in his first term and would be a tougher negotiator in his second			1
he did n't get the big deal that he set out for and some progressives think that he gave too much away , but getting @entity45 votes to raise taxes on the wealthy is significant			2
and he did pick @entity13 to be his vice president			2
the wealthy : despite higher taxes , it could have been a lot worse			0
the unemployed : another year of benefits for those actively looking for work			0
five things to know about the fiscal cliff losers the employed : the two - year payroll tax holiday is over , so take - home pay will go down -- around $ 2,000 less a year for the average wage earner as the rate went from 4.2 % to 6.2 %			1
but ending the tax holiday will add about $ 120 billion to federal coffers			0
house speaker @entity86 : he had to pull his " @entity92 " back from the floor when it became clear that he did n't have the @entity45 votes for passage and then had to sit back and watch @entity48 make a deal with @entity13			1
on tuesday , he was reduced to dodging microphones and listening to conservative members vent about the deal that was forced on them			0
while weakened , @entity86 's standing appears safe , though			2
really , who would want this job ? @entity32 @entity45 : could their reputation get any worse ? first , they publicly threaten the deal passed by the @entity22 to up the anxiety for the nation on @entity105			2
and then they cave when the votes to add spending cuts to that proposal never materialized			0
finally , they tell @entity112 victims waiting for more help from @entity0 to wait longer -- pushing back a vote on an aid package			0
a grand bargain : have you seen anything that makes you think these guys get a long - term deal done to address the real crisis on the debt ceiling a few more weeks down the road ? the can : that poor sucker gets a couple more dents and a few more scuffs as it gets kicked down the road again			0
@entity130 : what 's your message for @entity0 ?			0

@entity13 and @entity48 lauded for their ability to work together on deal
@entity37 sticks to his guns on deal -- for the most part
@entity86 takes some licks in fiscal cliff drama
*congressional* @entity45 *criticized* for threatening deal
