the next time your teen turns on @entity2 's " 16 and pregnant , " avoid any disparaging remarks			1
the show may actually encourage him or her to practice safer sex , according to a new study			2
the study , released monday by the @entity10 , says " @entity15 " ultimately led to a 5.7 % reduction in teen births in the 18 months after its premiere on tv			1
this would account for about one - third of the overall decline in teen births in the @entity22 during that period , researchers @entity16 and @entity18 concluded			1
in 2011 , a total of 329,797 babies were born in the @entity22 to girls between the ages of 15 and 19 ; that 's a rate of 31.3 births per every 1,000 girls , according to the @entity30			1
the @entity30 does not have rates available for 2012 ; @entity16 and @entity18 say that number dropped to 29.4 per every 1,000 that year			0
the declining teen birth rate is a well - documented trend in the @entity22			1
between 1991 and 2008 , the rate dropped steadily at an average of about 2.5 % a year			2
in the past four years , it has dropped even more dramatically at a rate of about 7.5 % per year			0
" we were really curious as to what was going on , " said @entity16 , who has been studying teen pregnancy interventions alongside @entity18 for more than a decade			2
when the researchers learned that @entity44 , ceo of the @entity45 to prevent teen and @entity47 , thought @entity2 's shows may have something to do with it , they thought : " could that really be true ? " @entity22 women having fewer children " @entity15 " premiered in june 2009 and has been on for five seasons , with a total of 47 episodes through october 2013			1
the show features one teen every episode and follows her through several months during and after pregnancy			0
the documentary - style show inspired several spinoffs , including the popular " @entity62			0
" both " @entity15 " and " @entity62 " have experienced their share of controversy			2
the shows are often criticized for glamorizing teen pregnancy			0
" instead of really helping viewers understand the day - to - day responsibilities of attending to a new infant -- scrubbing poop stains or spit - up out of clothing -- or dwelling on the ' mundane , ' @entity2 chooses to focus on the girls ' volatile relationships with the babies ' fathers or their new body piercings and tattoos , " @entity69 director @entity68 wrote on @entity70			2
" that makes for better tv			0
" @entity16 and @entity18 looked at @entity85 as well as search data from @entity87 and @entity88 to determine the show 's potential impact on teen birth rates			1
they recorded spikes in @entity95 searches and @entity88 mentions about the show when new episodes aired and looked specifically for searches on terms such as " birth control " and " abortion " alongside those spikes			1
photos : when teens want to have children they then analyzed geographic data to see whether locations with higher search activity and tweets about " @entity15 " showed higher levels of searches and tweets about birth control and abortion			1
the researchers also looked to see whether high viewership in certain areas corresponded with a bigger drop in teen births			1
" the results of our analysis indicate that exposure to ' @entity15 ' was high and that it had an influence on teens ' thinking regarding birth control and abortion , " the researchers write			1
that 's all well and scientific , but could a tv show really have that big of an impact on teen birth rates ? " it 's an extraordinary study done by two very cautious economists , " said @entity132 , chief program officer at the @entity45 to @entity133 and @entity47			2
" i jokingly refer to them as drs. no because they generally set out to say , ' that does n't work			0
' for that reason alone , we take it very seriously			0
" @entity16 said that while she and @entity18 did a lot of " fancy economic work " to make sure their conclusion was right , the most compelling evidence came from the teens ' social media language			0
" the text of the tweets are phenomenal : ' this reminds me to take my birth control			1
' ' @entity155 , going to take my birth control , ' " she remembered reading			1
of course , no one , including the study authors , is saying that @entity2 alone is responsible for the declining teen birth rate			1
pediatricians support condoms for teens about half of the recent dramatic decline can be attributed to the recession , @entity16 says			1
research shows that all birth rates fall during slow economic times , including teens ' ; those who were once ambivalent about using birth control often become more conscientious when they realize that finding -- or keeping -- a job to support a baby would be difficult			1
@entity16 believes tv shows like " @entity15 " work to deter teens in a similar way			2
" shows that make it clear how hard it can be ... affect girls who might not care otherwise , " she said			0
" you see she 's fighting with her boyfriend on a daily basis			0
her friends are partying without her			0
" making the immediate cost clear seems to get through to teens more than statistics that show what happens to teen parents when they 're 25 , @entity16 says			2
teens may turn to tv shows about sex because they 're lacking other options , @entity132 says			0
a recent study published in the medical journal @entity196 showed that doctors certainly are n't spending a lot of time talking about the important topic : the average conversation about sex between doctors and teens in the study lasted less than two minutes			0
doctors do n't talk to adolescents about sex and parents , @entity132 says , are often shocked to learn that teens say their parents have a major influence on their decisions about sex			0
" i think the takeaway here is that media can be , and often is , a force for good , " @entity132 said			0
" we have always viewed these particular shows as sex education for the 21st century			0

@entity2 's " @entity15 " may encourage teens to use birth control
teen births in the @entity22 have been steadily declining since 1991
part of the decline can be attributed to the recession , expert says
