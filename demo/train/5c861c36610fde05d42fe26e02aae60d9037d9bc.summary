-- when i was a little girl , my parents would take me every year to see " @entity3			1
" i remember practically drooling in awe as the massive christmas tree grew out of the stage until it towered over the audience , and hiding under my seat whenever that hideous , sword - wielding , gazillion - headed rat wobbled out onto the stage			1
last year , i went to see it again , just for old times ' sake			1
the takeaway : the grown - ups in " the @entity3 's " day knew how to throw a hell of a party			1
it was all so pretty and elegant			1
gorgeously clad ladies and top - hatted gentlemen arrived and immediately descended upon the champagne ; they danced and gave toasts , and sumptuous platters of fruit and glasses of mulled wine were toted about by equally well - clad servants			1
the kids made themselves scarce and played together with quaint wooden toys			2
ah , the good old days			2
as far as i can tell , there 's no reason why we ca n't have that sort of cultivated , old - timey holiday rituals and flourishes today as well			2
what follows is a short list of such pleasures , just in time for @entity39 and @entity41 's festivities			2
after all , if you ca n't be nostalgic during the holidays , when can you ? let 's bring back ... 1			1
@entity46 glass towers a round pyramid of stacked coupe champagne glasses , in which champagne is poured into the top glass and trickles down to the lower tiers			1
popular in the 1920s , such towers are gleaming monuments to pretty decadence			2
can you think of a more spectacular way to ring in the @entity41 ? 2			2
winter picnics a sublime way to spend a snowy afternoon			1
bundle up , fill your wicker picnic hamper with white wine ( which you can chill just by sticking it in a snowbank ) , a thermos of soup , and sandwiches			2
bring along a cheerful red wool plaid blanket to sit on -- and do n't forget your dog , who will love rooting around in the snow while you nestle and dine			1
@entity76 - paper - and - twine - wrapped packages @entity77 loved them in " @entity79 , " and so do i. they are a democratic approach to gift - wrapping -- and terribly mysterious as well			2
there could be anything inside , from a diamond necklace to a slab of fish			0
bonbons the perfect stocking stuffer for the glamorously indolent women in your life			0
while many types of candy today are described as " bonbons , " the cream - in - the - middle chocolate version of this confection used to be the symbol of lazy chicness : a lady of leisure would supposedly lie in bed all day and eat bonbons			0
in the popular imagination , these ladies were , of course , invariably clad in marabou - fringed dressing gowns			0
homely @entity39 trees lopsided ones with fat colored lights and homemade ornaments and popcorn strings			0
matchy - matchy @entity114 trees with white lights and red plaid ribbons look constipated			0
figgy pudding if the lyrics of " @entity120 " are an accurate indicator , something about figgy pudding makes people quite bossy and demanding : oh , bring us some figgy pudding and a good cup of cheer -- we wo n't go until we get some , so bring some right here			1
well , if it 's that good , maybe we should bring it back			1
punch bowls punch bowls are the @entity132 of serving ware : filled with pink party punch , they look dainty and sweet and innocent but portend all sorts of naughty behavior			0
they used to be the life of the party and deserve that honor once again			0
@entity142 parties a lovely , optimistic alternative to the typical @entity146 parties -- which are so often well - intentioned but disappointing			1
set up a lovely buffet and open your doors at noon			0
those who are nursing hangovers can stroll in later in the afternoon			0
skating parties grab ten of your closest friends , a handful of brightly colored stocking caps , and head to a pretty frozen lake or outdoor skating rink			1
these once - popular diversions were often followed by a post-skating party supper as well			0
the 1966 edition of " the @entity163 " recommends this endearing menu : @entity165 mixed @entity166 10			0
@entity167 his voice used to be synonymous with @entity39 , thanks to his rendition of " @entity39 " in the 1942 film " @entity172			0
" the nostalgic , comforting tenor of the song strongly resonated with war - weary @entity175 and overseas soldiers ; @entity167 's " @entity39 " single eventually sold more than 50 million copies , making it one of the best - selling singles in the world , according to " the @entity182			0
" happily , you can find @entity167 's @entity39 recordings with the wonderful @entity185 on @entity186 -- although i maintain that they still sound best on scratchy old records .			0
