@entity0 -- a good friend of mine recently learned she has breast cancer			1
even though i spend most of my time writing for a living , i was at a loss for the right words to comfort her			2
dr. @entity9 , a brain tumor survivor , urges extra sensitivity in talking to cancer patients			1
it was n't until i interviewed dr. @entity9 , a brain cancer survivor , that i discovered there is such a thing as cancer etiquette			1
" i found as a patient , sometimes people are awkward , and they 'll say the strangest things to you , " said @entity9 , former head of the @entity18 and the @entity19			1
she recounted in her book " @entity25 " a conversation with a female acquaintance who declared , " you look great			0
it 's amazing how good you can look when you 're dying			0
" in another instance , @entity9 recalled a woman grabbing her hair and feeling the texture and asking , " is that your hair , or is it a wig ? " not surprisingly , @entity9 said , such remarks are n't good cancer etiquette			1
@entity9 suggested that friends and loved ones can be more sensitive by imagining for a moment that they 're the patient			1
" it 's not bad to say wait a minute -- what would i want someone to say to me ? " she recommended starting out with some tenderness			0
" this is a tender time , " she said			0
" it can be , ' hey , you know you 're great			0
i love you and i 'm here for you			0
' " @entity9 said it is important to offer plenty of encouragement either in person or in a letter			1
" i know you can do this			0
having cancer is n't fun			1
you 're going to face some difficult times , but i know you can do this			0
" she cautioned people to " think before they speak " to someone with newly diagnosed cancer			2
" one thing you do n't want to do is instantly assume it 's terminal			1
... often there is a feeling that people are going to write them off , or they 're going to count them out			2
" health minute : more on cancer etiquette in her book , @entity9 wrote , " banish the following from your vocabulary : terminal , incurable , hopeless and salvage			1
" " how you think and talk will influence how you relate , " she said			0
@entity81 , a former @entity1 executive producer and co-creator of @entity83 , agreed			1
her stage 1 breast cancer was diagnosed four years ago			2
in her new book , " five lessons i did n't learn from @entity90 ( and one @entity91 i did ) , " @entity86 scolded what she called the attitude police			2
" they are your friends and family , very well - meaning people , who tell you to be careful and upbeat , but it puts you in a defensive position , " @entity86 said			2
like @entity9 , @entity86 said she encourages people to think before they say something inappropriate			1
she said she believes it is even more important to spend time listening to a cancer patient rather than doing all the talking			2
@entity86 said that is especially true when it comes to offering advice			0
" if you 're not a doctor , do n't tell me how seven of your friends were treated , because you do n't know my specific situation , " @entity86 said			0
she said she prefers positive conversations			0
" i liked hearing that i seemed like myself again			0
it meant that i was in control , and i was able to believe it , " she said			0
if you want to help a friend , @entity86 recommended making specific gestures that are thoughtful			1
@entity9 added if you 're uncertain how your words or actions will be received , then it may be better to stick with something simple			1
she said , " a hug or ' thinking of you , dear friend ' note can mean a lot , too			0
