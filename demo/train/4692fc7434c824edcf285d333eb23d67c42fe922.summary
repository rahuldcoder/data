-- former @entity2 president @entity1 came to power in a bloodless military coup in 1999 when he was chief of @entity2 's army			1
he held power until the 2008 elections after which he resigned			0
since then he has lived in self - imposed exile in @entity9			0
in late 2010 he launched the @entity11 party with a view to running for office in 2013			0
@entity1 now says he plans to return to his home country sometime at the end of january			1
how did @entity1 establish himself as a player in @entity2 politics ? like most muslims , @entity1 's family moved to @entity2 when @entity20 was divided into @entity20 and @entity2 , and settled in @entity21			1
@entity1 's father was a career diplomat , which saw him spend his early childhood in @entity25 due to his father 's assignment in @entity28			1
but despite early family life in civil service , @entity1 decided on a different career path -- in 1964 he was commissioned second lieutenant in an artillery regiment in the @entity34			2
his rise through the military would help cement his political power in @entity2 by gaining the backing of the country 's armed forces			1
he was promoted to major general in 1991 , appointed chief of army staff with rank of general in 1998 , and then made chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the following year			0
how did @entity1 gain power in @entity2 ? it was during his stint as the country 's military chief that there was an opening for @entity1 's political ascendancy , when in 1999 the then - prime minister @entity55 dismissed him after the army 's failed invasion in @entity58 , in @entity60 - administered @entity59			1
as @entity1 was returning from an overseas visit in october 1999 , @entity55 refused to allow the commercial airliner with 200 passengers on board to land			1
within hours the army had deposed @entity55 in a bloodless coup , and the plane was allowed to touch down with only 10 minutes of fuel left			1
in 2001 @entity1 appointed himself president of @entity2 while remaining the head of the army			2
@entity1 's rule : strengthening his grip on power in april 2002 a referendum allowed @entity1 to hold office for a further five years			1
four months later , @entity1 implemented 29 amendments to the constitution , granting himself the power to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister			1
in a televised address in december 2004 , @entity1 announced that he would not step down as top military leader , even though he had previously agreed to give up the position of the head of the army at the end of 2004			2
he said that he needed to maintain his position in order to watch over anti-terrorist operations			0
during his rule , @entity2 attained respectable growth rates and established a generally favorable investment climate			2
along with that came a growing middle class , a more aggressive media , and a more assertive judiciary			0
" he brought parliamentary reforms			0
he brought women into the parliament , " said @entity97 , director of the @entity98			0
but , analysts say , @entity1 never lost his military mindset			2
" he in a way , always believed in a unity of command , a very centralized command , which means his command , in fact , " said lt. gen. @entity108 , a political analyst			0
why did things turn sour for @entity1 ? @entity1 's popularity began plummeting in 2007 after he suspended @entity113 chief justice @entity112 for " misuse of authority			1
" the move triggered protests and accusations that he was trying to influence the court 's ruling on whether he could run for another five - year term			0
@entity112 was reinstated but the damage was done			0
in october of that year , @entity1 was re-elected president by a parliament critics said was stacked with his supporters			2
opposition parties filed a challenge			0
the next month , he declared a state of emergency , suspended @entity2 's constitution , replaced the chief judge again and blacked out independent tv outlets			1
under pressure from the @entity133 , @entity1 later lifted the emergency and promised elections in january 2008			2
he allowed @entity55 , the prime minister he deposed , to return from exile			1
he also let in another political foe , former prime minister @entity139 who led the @entity141			1
however , in december 2007 , the country was plunged into further turmoil when @entity139 was assassinated			2
@entity139 had returned from a self - imposed , eight - year exile to run in the country 's general elections two months before her assassination and already had escaped one attempt on her life			2
she was killed by a 15 - year - old suicide bomber while campaigning in the @entity2 city of @entity152 , the seat of the country 's military			1
@entity1 's government and the @entity157 contend the killing was orchestrated by a group with ties to @entity161 , but polls found that a majority of @entity2 believe @entity1 's government was complicit			1
in 2010 , further criticism of @entity1 emerged after the @entity166 ruled that @entity139 's death could have been prevented had @entity1 's government taken adequate measures to protect her			1
@entity1 rejected the findings , saying that @entity139 had police protection and took unnecessary risks			0
meanwhile , several other factors compounded @entity1 's declining popularity : a shortage of essential food items , power cuts , and skyrocketing inflation			1
in february 2008 @entity1 's party admitted defeat in parliamentary elections and he was succeeded by @entity181 , @entity139 's widower			1
the leaders of @entity2 's two main opposition parties formed a coalition and vowed to restore deposed judges			2
six months later , the coalition moved to impeach @entity1 , who then resigned as president , though he said the allegations of misconduct were false			0
he went into self - imposed exile in @entity9			0
in august 2009 , @entity2 's supreme court found that @entity1 had violated the constitution in 2007 when he imposed a national state of emergency			1
government officials said that if he returned , he 'd be arrested			0
what now for @entity2 's former president ? in may 2010 @entity1 announced on @entity0 that he planned to re-enter @entity2 politics and launched a new political party in october of that year			1
but a @entity2 court later issued an arrest warrant for him in connection to the assassination of @entity139			0
@entity1 's legal adviser told @entity0 that the accusations were baseless			1
@entity1 now says he 'll return to his country between january 27 and 30 , despite word from authorities that he will be arrested when he does so			1
@entity208 , a special public prosecutor in the assassination case , said a @entity152 court has already issued an arrest warrant for @entity1			0
" they are bound to execute the order unless a higher court sets aside the orders , " @entity208 said , adding that @entity1 is accused of conspiring in the assassination			0
@entity1 announces he will return to @entity2 late this month @entity1 's attorney , @entity217 , said the threat of arrest is politically motivated and has no legal bearing			1
the warrant is being challenged in court , the attorney said			0
he described the claim that @entity1 could be arrested at any time upon return as " absurd			2
" @entity1 said that he will return even at the risk of his life			2
speaking to @entity0 , the former president said he had declined to provide a specific date because of security concerns			0
he spoke about the possibility of arrest , but said he expects he will be fine , so long as " the judiciary plays its just role , and there are no interruptions			0
" he described his support as scattered , and said he needs to build it again from the ground up			0
" this is a do - or - die moment for me and my party			0
i need to muster all the support i can , " he said			0
