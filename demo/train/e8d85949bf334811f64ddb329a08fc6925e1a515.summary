witnesses said @entity16 snipers were positioned in various parts of the city			2
@entity0 is the last major point between pro-government forces and @entity33			1

in @entity7 , west of @entity0 , @entity4 " is bombing his way into the city , " witness @entity51 said			1
" he does n't care if all the people ( there ) are dead by the end of the day			0
" @entity51 accused @entity4 of launching a " cowardly , murderous attack			1
" " people are not safe			0

" he said @entity4 's forces had not yet been able to get into the city			1
@entity51 described described himself as a 46 - year - old it engineer and a member of the local opposition council			0
he called himself a rebel fighter but said he had no weapons			2
the rebels are fighting with whatever arms they can capture from government troops , he said , such as @entity27 rifles			2
" the best we have " is rocket - propelled grenade launchers , he said			0
@entity2 journalists in @entity1 were not able to reach @entity7 to confirm @entity51 's account			1
but a second witness also said the city came under sustained attack by forces loyal to @entity4 on wednesday			1
the tank and artillery fire went on for at least two hours , he said			0
" we hear very , very , very loud explosions , " said the witness , who did not want to be named			0

government forces said they had no information about the missing journalists and said that if they were picked up by the @entity1 military , they would have been taken back to @entity103			1
@entity4 's battles to recapture a number of rebel - held towns and cities come on the day the @entity110 @entity109 considered imposing a no - fly zone over @entity1			1
wednesday ended with no agreement on a draft resolution , but several diplomats expressed optimism that a vote would come soon			0
the @entity118 ambassador to the @entity110 said late wednesday that envoys were considering a variety of options to protect civilians in @entity1 , not just a no - fly zone or a cease fire			1
@entity125 said a " range of actions " were up for serious discussion , including but not limited to a no - fly zone , which has " inherent limitations in terms of protection of civilians			2
" a diplomatic source told @entity2 that air strikes are among options being discussed as diplomats focus on what should be in a @entity109 resolution			2
the international community is keenly aware of the urgency and gravity of the situation on ground , @entity140 continued			2
she said she hopes to see a serious resolution as early as thursday			0
the @entity149 ambassador had earlier confirmed that text for a new draft resolution on @entity1 had been submitted to diplomats			1
he also told reporters that he expected a vote on the resolution within 24 hours			0
@entity157 's @entity110 ambassador , @entity156 , said @entity159 countries are committed to participating in a no - fly zone			1
that has been an apparent prerequisite for @entity118 support of such a zone			2
the @entity157 diplomat would n't detail the level of potential @entity159 participation but said it would be " significant " and said it has " been confirmed by the highest political authorities			0
" the @entity149 foreign minister said on his blog wednesday that several @entity159 countries would be willing to participate in a targeted attack on @entity4 's air assets			2
the minister , @entity176 , did not specify which countries or how they would participate			0
without implementation of a no - fly zone , rebels fear that it is only a matter of time before there is a bloodbath in @entity33			0
@entity1 's deputy ambassador to the @entity110 expressed this fear wednesday			1
@entity4 " has given instructions for ethnic cleansing , " @entity188 said , adding that the @entity1 leader would commit genocide against rebels if he was not stopped by the international community			1
@entity188 said he expects the @entity109 to produce a draft resolution soon			0
" international consensus is in the process of building , " @entity188 said in the @entity109 's briefing room			0
@entity188 made headlines in february when he joined with @entity1 ambassador to the @entity110 @entity202 to condemn @entity4 and request that he step down as @entity1 's leader			1
@entity1 's government has subsequently requested that @entity188 and @entity202 be denied the right to speak for @entity1 at the @entity110			1
women marched in @entity33 on wednesday , carrying banners reading , " how many @entity1 must die to get the @entity109 to move on			2
" @entity118 secretary of state @entity208 told reporters wednesday that opinions in a number of countries initially opposed to the imposition of a no - fly zone shifted after the @entity215 announced its support for such a step			2
" intense negotiations " are underway at the @entity109 , she said			0
" we are moving as rapidly as we can to get additional authorization			0
" a council diplomat said @entity222 was engaged in negotiations on the text			0
@entity226 's @entity110 ambassador said his country has still questions about such a zone			1
@entity231 's @entity110 ambassador asked , " who will implement the no - fly zone ? who would provide assets for it ? " @entity238 's @entity110 ambassador said his country is concerned about deteriorating conditions in @entity1 but did n't say whether @entity240 backs a no - fly measure			1
@entity51 , the opposition leader in @entity7 , urged @entity238 and @entity242 to " look in the mirror " and understand that " they are hindering the international effort to put this war criminal in his place			0
" while the @entity215 recommendation of a no - fly zone carried some weight with reluctant council nations , another declaration from the league that there should be " no foreign intervention " has perplexed delegates			0
en route to @entity222 after a weekend trip to @entity261 , @entity118 defense secretary @entity258 said monday that the logistical challenges of enforcing a no - fly zone over @entity1 could be overcome			1
" if we are directed to impose a no - fly zone , we have the resources to do it , " he said			0
" the question is whether it 's a wise thing to do			0
and that 's the discussion that 's going at a political level			0
" @entity2 's @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity24 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 and @entity281 , and journalist @entity282 contributed to this report .			0
