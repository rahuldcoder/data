-- forests in the @entity2 are dying twice as fast as they were 17 years ago , and scientists blame warming temperatures for the trend , according to a new study			1
this photo of @entity8 in @entity9 shows dying pines and firs among healthy trees			1
the study , to be released friday in the journal @entity14 , is the first large - scale analysis of environmental changes as contributing factors in the mortality of coniferous forests			1
the data for this research was gathered by generations of scientists over a 50 - year period at multiple sites in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity9 , @entity30 and southwestern @entity31			1
seventy - six forest plots , all more than 200 years old , were monitored by scientists doing some of the most rudimentary research -- counting trees			1
" it 's not a happy story , but , an important one , " said @entity36 , a research ecologist with the @entity37 and the lead author of the study			1
" these are beautiful places			0
they do change and respond to their environment , sometimes quickly			0
" " if in your hometown where you live , the death rates of your friends and neighbors doubled and there are no compensating birth rates , would n't you want to figure out what 's going on ? " said @entity47 , research ecologist with the @entity37 and one of the authors of the report			0
the study primarily focused on three types of coniferous trees : pines , firs and hemlocks			1
older - growth forests -- some up to 500 years old -- have trees of all ages , and researchers found that mortality rates have increased for all age groups			1
since mortality rates went up across the board , scientists ruled out a number of other possible causes , including ozone - related air pollution , long - term effects of fire suppression and normal forest dynamics			1
in the end , @entity28 had the highest tree death rate			0
of the three types of coniferous trees studied , pines were found to be dying at the fastest rate			2
ultimately , higher tree mortality may lead to significant shifts in forest structure and function , the report states			0
" much of the world 's population in @entity98 , @entity99 , most of @entity101 and large portions of @entity102 live near temperate forests , so what happens in these forests has global importance , " said @entity91 , a professor of forest resources at the @entity93 whose work was instrumental in maintaining the research plots			2
" my guess is that forest loss has the potential to greatly exceed forest establishment , " he added			0
the new findings concern scientists who see the study as further confirmation of the harmful effects of climate change on ecosystems			1
according to the @entity121 , a scientific intergovernmental body , concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are now at their highest levels for at least 650,000 years			2
scientists on the panel say the increase began with the birth of the @entity128 250 years ago			1
the new research also suggests that as trees die , they actually emit more carbon than they absorb			0
trees are key players in regulating climate because they convert carbon dioxide , which they store in their trunks and roots , to oxygen			0
changes in climatic conditions or various diseases can cause the gradual dying of plant shoots			2
" the concern here is that these might be early warning signs of dieback , " said @entity47			0
some scientists say that tree species unable to tolerate warmer conditions might just re-establish themselves in cooler areas			2
given the speed at which warming appears to be occurring , it 's not clear whether tree species will be able to migrate fast enough to survive , said @entity36 of the @entity37			1
" warmer temperatures cause earlier summer droughts , less snow pack , and cause ideal breeding grounds for invasive species and pathogens , " he added			2
" one hypothesis is that warmer climates can make it easier for invasive species to reproduce and grow in these temperate forests			2
if the trees are already under a lot of environmental stress , they are more prone to serious insect attack , " he said			0
scientists say forests in the @entity174 @entity173 have been increasingly damaged in recent years by invasive insect species such as the bark beetle -- a sign that rising temperatures are having an adverse effect			1
bark beetles are known to attack trees already weakened by other environmental factors			0
" many of these beetles can not survive in cold temperatures , and it 's getting warmer , " said @entity183 , a Â­ research marine physicist at @entity184 at the @entity185			0
@entity183 authored a research paper linking drought conditions in the @entity192 to increased human activity			0
" it is perfectly reasonable to assume that this problem is going to get worse , not better , " he said .			0
