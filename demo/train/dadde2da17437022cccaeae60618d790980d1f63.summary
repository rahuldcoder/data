-- just out of high school , my young developing mind could n't resist the temptation of the @entity6 recruiters : they promised challenge and hardship , in comparison to the other armed services , which promised money and travel as their main recruiting incentives			1
so , on september 24 , 2003 -- my 18th birthday -- i enlisted in the @entity6 while my parents were away on vacation , a trip they promptly returned from upon hearing the news			1
my time in the @entity6 offered an escape from the isolated @entity22 upbringing that i 'd experienced			1
once my training was completed , i found myself stationed in @entity24 , @entity25 's sacrificial prefecture to the @entity26			2
my initial two - year tour of duty in @entity24 was regularly marked with frequent physical and mental abuse at the hands of noncommissioned officers within my unit , several of whom exhibited signs of post-traumatic stress			2
on a regular basis i found myself the target of homophobic and racist comments from those entrusted with my well - being and training , often times in front of those i was in charge of leading			1
my time on @entity24 came to an end when i received orders to @entity46			2
i happily reported to my new unit , hoping deployment would offer a welcome escape from the physical and verbal harassment , degradation and humiliation that had become daily life			1
the harassment i 'd experienced in my previous unit gave way to trust and camaraderie , though this , too , would soon fade			1
the enemy within weeks before leaving @entity24 for the sands of @entity46 , i found myself pinned down , fighting off a sexual assault by a fellow @entity6 : a noncommissioned officer i was about to deploy with , who i was supposed to trust my life to			1
i still remember the laughter as i fought back			2
this would occur twice , both times by the same @entity6			1
the feelings of helplessness , powerlessness , guilt and shame would grow over the years			2
i felt weak , unable to protect myself			2
like thousands of sexual assault survivors in the military , fear of victim blaming and feelings of shame and guilt prevented me from reporting what happened			1
after my first deployment i was experiencing emotional detachment			2
i felt myself not participating in the world around me , observing from a distance			2
i found no place in the society i had returned to			2
i became violent at the slightest cue , and began drinking heavily			2
depression and anxiety swept through me			2
though i can now articulate the emotional context of my experience , at the time every emotion , fear , hurt , shame , guilt , was externalized through anger , rage and violence			2
i was blinded to the reality of what i was experiencing			2
my anger was simply the intensity that a @entity6 required			1
emotional detachment and numbness cultivated the objectivity needed to evaluate and execute the mission			2
my drinking seamlessly blended with the would - be frat - house @entity6 barracks culture			1
i reported symptoms of ptsd to my command via a pencil and paper questionnaire known as a @entity117 , at the discouragement and warning of a @entity120 , yet no offer of treatment was extended			1
my subsequent deployments would only serve to compound the trauma i had experienced , as i was on guard not only for the so - called enemy , but like so many of my sisters - in - arms , for my fellow @entity6 as well			1
after completing my second deployment to @entity46 , i separated from the @entity6 to attend @entity129			1
i believed at the time i was leaving an old life behind me to begin a new life as a college freshman , but i soon discovered that stepping back out into the world would not be the seamless transition i had come to envision			0
my struggles in the @entity6 had come to a close			1
little did i know that my battle with @entity139 was on the horizon			1
from suicidal thoughts to long waits and lots of pills as self - isolation became my preferred method of treating my anxiety , my relationships with my parents and my partner deteriorated			0
i felt distanced from those around me and those i cared about , which fed my anger			0
my anger fed into guilt , then isolation and then anger			0
this became my every day			0
after nearly three years , my anger and depression drove my partner to leave			0
losing the only relationship i 'd managed to maintain deepened my depression			0
i began imagining how i would take my life			0
the @entity165 : @entity167 's impact on military families with the barrel to my temple and my finger on the trigger , i began to wonder what the moments between the gun firing and my death would be like			0
in my questioning i realized that what i wanted was not to die , but to reclaim agency of my life and live it instead of simply survive through it			0
while i had no desire to harm myself , more than anything , i desired relief			0
on the verge of suicide and struggling to stay in school , i began to seek treatment at the @entity187			1
this task was , in the truest sense , easier said than done			0
wait times for appointments ranged from three to six months			0
spending an hour on hold was the norm , and being hung up on was common practice			0
my first appointment requesting mental health treatment was december 2011			1
my first appointment with a therapist was october 2012 , a 10 - month gap			0
in those 10 months , according to the @entity139 estimates , more than 6,000 veterans took their own lives			1
long before i would ever see a therapist , the @entity139 would cycle me through half a dozen medicines in less than three months , though this was far less than the buffet of lithium and opiates many other veterans are prescribed			1
upon graduation , i relocated to @entity211 and immediately enrolled in the local @entity139 system , looking to continue the treatment i had fought so hard to receive before			1
after my initial intake , every mental health appointment i scheduled would be involuntarily canceled and pushed to a later date , only to have them , too , be canceled			0
during this time , news broke that delays in care had been a problem at @entity139 clinics nationwide			1
i eventually gave up on the @entity139 and began managing symptoms of my ptsd using medicinal cannabis and @entity227 meditation			1
it was clear to me that the @entity139 was there to placate , not to heal veterans			1
@entity230 : we owe vets real change @entity235 discovery it was my search for true healing that led me to @entity238			1
i traveled there as part of a study conducted by @entity242			0
i had been following the association 's @entity244 treatment research for years , and regularly advocated for @entity242 in my daily discussions with fellow veterans			1
in @entity238 , i met other veterans who had also become disillusioned with the cold , sterile , institutionalized treatment they had received when they returned home from combat			1
when we arrived at the @entity253 in @entity254 , @entity238 , i was unsure what to expect			0
i had read about ayahuasca , and listened to firsthand accounts from other veterans of its healing effects , but never imagined i myself would have the opportunity to experience it firsthand			1
i participated in three ayahuasca ceremonies , all conducted alongside other veterans			1
each ceremony lasted approximately four hours			0
before each ceremony we would come together and discuss our intention or focus would be for the ceremony that evening			0
we sat by candlelight , as one by one we drank our cup of medicine , then in darkness as we waited for the medicine to come up through us			0
@entity275 allowed me to examine myself from a new perspective , progressively deeper with each ceremony			0
i was able to recall trauma and remember parts of my experiences that had previously been blocked out			0
i was able to process not only experiences from the military , but also from throughout my entire life and see how they synthesized into the person i had become			0
i felt a love and acceptance like never before			0
negativity and pain lifted from my shoulders and released from my body in what felt like what i can only describe as a psychedelic baptism			0
since returning home to @entity296 , i 've become an even more vocal advocate for psychedelic treatment			2
with the advent of the legalization of medicinal and recreational cannabis , i believe it is important that we continue on in the fight against the drug war			0
psychedelics including @entity307 , lsd and psilocybin should be rescheduled to allow research into their medicinal benefits and let the facts speak for themselves			0
@entity315 's veterans are returning from over a decade of perpetual war , only to find themselves on the front lines , this time battling the government that sent them to fight , for their right to heal			0
@entity320 is on the horizon , and as with all @entity315 's battles , its veterans will lead the way .			0
