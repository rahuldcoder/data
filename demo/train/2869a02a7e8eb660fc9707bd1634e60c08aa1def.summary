dr. @entity0 was sentenced tuesday to four years in the @entity2 jail -- the maximum sentence allowed under the law -- in the death of @entity6			1
he may serve no more than two , however			0
@entity8 judge @entity7 , in a lengthy statement delivered before sentencing @entity0 for involuntary manslaughter , said he felt a significant responsibility to determine the appropriate sentence , utilizing his " sense of fairness and decency			2
" " there are those who feel dr. @entity0 is a saint , " judge @entity7 said			1
" there are those who feel dr. @entity0 is the devil			1
he 's a human being			0
he stands convicted of the death of another human being			2
" automatic credit for good behavior lowers the actual time served to two years , which puts his projected release date in late 2013 , @entity27 's spokesman @entity26 said			1
overheard on @entity32 : is 4 - year sentence fair ? @entity0 is not eligible for early release electronic monitoring or house arrest , which some county prisoners get under a federal court order aimed at reducing jail overcrowding , @entity26 said			2
" he does not meet our requirements for any kind of home monitoring , " he said			0
members of @entity6 's family , who sat in court for tuesday 's sentencing , appeared pleased with the judge 's decision to ignore defense pleas for leniency			1
a statement from the family , read in court by a lawyer , said they were " not here to seek revenge , " but they wanted a sentence that " reminds physicians that they can not sell their services to the highest bidder and cast aside their @entity65 oath to do no harm			0
" it included a message to the judge from @entity6 's three children , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
" we will grow up without a father , our best friend , our playmate and our dad , " the children said			1
defense lawyer @entity81 acknowledged that it was unlikely pastor would accept probation for @entity0 , but he still made a case for community service over time behind bars			2
" he could do things for the community on probation that he could never do sitting in that little room , " @entity89 said			0
even without jail time , @entity89 said , he will suffer the rest of his life because of the loss of his medical career and the stigma of the conviction			0
" whether he is a barista the rest of his life , whether he is a greeter at @entity102 , he 's still going to be the man who killed @entity6 for the rest of his life , " @entity89 said			2
deputy district attorney @entity104 , arguing for the maximum four years in jail , said @entity0 was " playing @entity107 roulette with @entity6 's life every single night , " by using the surgical anesthetic propofol to put him to sleep in " a reckless , obscene manner			1
" @entity0 showed his lack of remorse or acceptance of his personal responsibility in an interview nine days before he was found guilty , @entity104 said			2
" i do n't feel guilty because i did not do anything wrong , " @entity0 said in a documentary aired days after he was convicted			2
pastor delivered a 30 - minute explanation of why he was sentencing @entity121 to the maximum jail time , even though the doctor was technically eligible for probation			0
@entity0 's " faux documentary " made it appear he was just a " bystander " in @entity6 's death who was " entrapped " and " betrayed " by his patient , @entity7 said			1
" yikes ! talk about blaming the victim , " he said			0
" not only is n't there any remorse , there 's umbrage and outrage on the part of dr. @entity0 against the decedent , without any , any indication of the slightest involvement in this case			1
" @entity7 said that while he had considered the entire " book " of @entity0 's life , he also had " read the book of @entity6 's life			1
" " regrettably , as far as dr. @entity0 is concerned , the most significant chapter , as it relates to this case , is the chapter involving the treatment , or lack of treatment , of @entity6			1
" @entity6 died " not because of an isolated one - off occurrence or incident , " pastor said			0
" he died because of a totality of circumstances which are directly attributable to dr. @entity0 ... because of a series of decisions that dr. @entity0 made			1
" @entity0 , he said , became involved in " a cycle of horrible medicine			0
" he cited @entity0 's " pattern of deceit and lies			1
that pattern was to assist dr. @entity0			2
" a tape recording of @entity6 's slurred voice was @entity0 's " insurance policy , " @entity7 said			1
" it was designed to record his patient surreptitiously at that patient 's most vulnerable point			0
i ca n't even imagine that happening to any of us because of the horrific violation of trust			0
" he said he wondered whether that tape would have been offered for sale , had @entity6 not died and a rift had developed between the two in the future			0
one of the 12 jurors who found @entity0 guilty said in an interview airing tuesday on @entity184 's " issues with @entity183 , " that the recording did not play into the verdict			2
" we talked about that audio a little bit , " @entity187 , known as " juror 5 , " said			0
" we did n't really understand why it was presented			0
i still do not understand what that was about			0
" @entity0 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter three weeks ago after a trial in which prosecutors successfully argued that @entity0 's reckless use of propofol to help @entity6 sleep , without proper monitoring equipment , led to the singer 's death			1
" we had decided the three issues we were going to focus on were the not calling 911 , not having the medical equipment and him leaving the room , " @entity204 said			0
" that was the bottom line for this case			0
" testimony during the trial revealed that @entity0 gave propofol nearly every night in the two months before the singer 's death on june 25 , 2009 , as @entity6 prepared for his comeback concerts set for @entity215 the next month			1
the judge set a hearing for january 23 to decide on the prosecution 's request that @entity0 be ordered to pay @entity6 's estate and his children more than $ 100 million in restitution for the " wage and profits lost , " as provided under @entity228 's " victim 's bill of rights " law			1
the singer 's " estate estimates @entity6 's projected earnings for the 50 - show @entity235 concert series to be $ 100 million , " the prosecutors said			1
with nearly $ 2 million in funeral expenses and 10 % interest added each year , the prosecution is asking pastor to order @entity0 to pay @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity240 more than $ 120 million in restitution			0
while it is doubtful that @entity0 , who is unlikely to ever practice medicine again , could pay very much of that sum , it could prevent him from reaping financial benefits from any books , interviews or film projects in the future .			0

dr. @entity0 's release date is projected for late 2013 , the *sheriff* 's spokesman says
" we will grow up without a father , our best friend , our playmate and our dad , " @entity6 's children say
