-- when @entity3 's architect first unleashed the idea of creating a decentralized virtual currency on the internet , the tech - savvy elite sat up and listened			1
just a year later , operating under the pseudonym @entity10 , the unknown developer took the concept live			2
by year - end , over 1.6 million bitcoins had been mined			2
since then , the meteoric rise of the digital currency has continued to capture the world 's attention as financial institutions now examine its viability			0
at a time when many have lost faith in the global financial system , @entity3 is being hailed as the future of e-commerce			1
" it 's lower cost , lower risk and a more accessible form of payment from anything else we have today , especially for shopping online , " says @entity25 , founder of @entity26 , a @entity3 payment processing service			1
" credit cards were designed in the 1950s and were never designed for the @entity36			0
it leads to issues like identity theft and payment fraud			0
" @entity25 -- who recently testified before a @entity42 committee on the growth of @entity3 -- explains that the virtual peer - to - peer currency was created to be " borderless by design , " thus opening the door to the international marketplace for smaller merchants			1
@entity36 's currency of choice the anonymity of the currency is also a plus for @entity3 users as no verified personal data is required for making online transactions			1
this has led many to speculate that @entity3 will be mainly used for illegal online transactions			1
" for small businesses that have unique items , it really opens up their business to a truly worldwide customer base ... it 's going to become the default payment system for the internet by the end of this decade , " adds @entity25			0
while @entity3 's electronic nature makes it appealing for e-commerce , @entity25 acknowledges that there are still some kinks in the system that need to be ironed out			1
" tax implications and potential regulation are some obstacles we face ... the other issue is that perhaps [ @entity3 ] is not quite ready for mainstream consumers just yet			1
" i think we 've got quite a bit more work to do on the engineering side ... but i would expect @entity3 will soon become the preferred method of payment for connecting businesses over the @entity36 , " predicts @entity25			1
the implications for e-commerce from the @entity3 experiment continue to intrigue economists and financial analysts as some believe the crypto - currency could revolutionize the global marketplace			1
@entity3 to replace traditional banking ? " for more conventional businesses , i think the advantages are really in international commerce , " says @entity95 , director for the @entity97 service at @entity98			1
" you have significantly reduced transaction costs compared to converting one international currency to another international currency -- it 's typically cheaper			0
" meanwhile , @entity107 , an economist and professor at @entity109 says : " the brilliance behind the technical design of @entity3 is the fact that the mechanism for payment is a distributed network			1
it does n't run in a data center owned by @entity120 or @entity121 or @entity122			0
" the added bonus ? no middlemen taking a cut from the transaction , he says			0
@entity107 explains the currency 's recent surge is largely responsible for grabbing the financial world 's attention			0
erratic price value in january 2013 , one @entity3 was worth around $ 13 , surging in november to a staggering all - time high of $ 1,242 -- almost the same price as an ounce of gold			1
but since then , its value has dropped again to around $ 925 , according to @entity139 exchange rates			0
and , according to @entity107 , @entity3 's erratic fluctuation is exactly what deters some businesses from adopting the currency : " you would n't want to reprice every article in your shop everyday , which is why we like standard exchange rates			1
" " [ if ] you 're a retailer and you carry Â £ 100 ( $ 164 ) in your till overnight , normally you 're not really worried about the fact that it 's going to still be Â £ 100 in the morning			0
" it could indeed become the system of payment [ online ] , but it has to get over this hurdle of volatility			2
you have to bridge that gap between what we trust today and the type of thing we might trust tomorrow			0
" but while some tout @entity3 as the future of online shopping , others are describing it as the latest monetary fad			1
@entity167 , chief economist at @entity169 - based foreign exchange firm , @entity168 , says @entity3 is a mere internet affectation			1
" it still appears to be a very niche payment option ... until the volatility calms down , the use of it as a payment method -- to buy shopping , a house , a car , send children to university for example -- is going to be very , very limited			2
" traders do n't want volatility in the currency that they are taking in			2
they do n't want additional cost , " he adds			0
the @entity186 conundrum despite these concerns , some central banks have begun to throw their weight behind the virtual currency			0
@entity191 announced it recognized @entity3 as " private money " -- but until more central banks , like the @entity194 , back it , @entity3 will remain a niche digital payment option , warns @entity167			1
one key country that @entity3 enthusiasts and analysts have been closely watching is @entity186			1
" the @entity186 are the big , big domino to fall			0
if the @entity186 get behind it , then it will become a part of an @entity36 revolution , " says @entity167			0
but last thursday the @entity204 placed a ban on financial institutions handling the money after stipulating that the virtual cash had no legal status			0
with yet another hurdle now in place for @entity3 , @entity167 believes its widespread adoption is a little optimistic			2
" certainly , you can believe that the future of internet commerce will involve these kind of instantaneous payment methods			2
i have no doubt about that -- but people want simplicity			0
" at the moment , the @entity3 experiment does n't offer simplicity			2
it complicates matters by people having to understand another way of doing things			0
