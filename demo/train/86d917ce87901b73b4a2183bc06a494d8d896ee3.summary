-- @entity2 newspaper publishers have failed in their bid to block a new government - backed royal charter on press regulation , clearing the way for a new system of regulation proposed by @entity2 lawmakers but opposed by news publishing companies			1
the royal charter is lawmakers ' attempt to implement the recommendations of the 2012 @entity16 into press ethics , which was set up after outrage over claims of widespread phone hacking and other abuses by elements of the @entity2 press			1
supporters of the charter say it provides the legal framework and sufficient penalties to ensure effective self - regulation by a press which , they believe , has failed to do so in the past			1
detractors say the government should never have a role , however remote , in regulating the press , and that the proposed charter is an attack on journalism and on press freedom			2
at hacked off , a campaign group which fought for the changes and was set up in the wake of the phone hacking scandal , a spokesman said : " news publishers now have a great opportunity to join a scheme that will not only give the public better protection from press abuses , but will also uphold freedom of expression , protect investigative journalism and benefit papers financially ... " the time has come for the newspaper companies to listen to all of those voices , including the vast majority of their readers , and to distance themselves from a past marred by bullying , fabrication and intrusion			1
" but @entity64 , a former editor who is now a media commentator , said in his @entity67 column : " it means , now that the @entity69 has approved it , that we face the existence of a royal charter to set up a system of press regulation that no publisher will sign up for			1
they will simply ignore its existence			2
" " instead , the publishers will create their own system , having already advanced concrete plans for a new regulator , the @entity84 ( @entity85 )			0
" in the @entity88 , @entity86 , a member of the @entity87 , went further			0
he said the government 's royal charter " prescribes an unwanted , untried , untested , under - researched system of arbitration for media law disputes mostly paid for by the media whether they win or lose , taking place in secret , and leaving those who opt out with the future burden of punitive legal costs for open justice high court litigation			1
" at the @entity2 @entity104 's @entity103 , a spokesperson said : " a @entity105 will protect @entity106 whilst offering real redress when mistakes are made			0
importantly , it is the best way of resisting full statutory regulation that others have tried to impose			0
we will continue to work with the @entity113 , as we always have , and recent changes secured by the @entity115 , to arbitration , the standards code and the parliamentary lock will ensure the system is workable			0
" but @entity120 , editor of the @entity121 , tweeted : " well done everyone involved in the @entity105			0
chances of us signing up for state interference : zero			0
" and @entity125 , a @entity0 contributor and @entity128 journalism professor tweeted : " the @entity105 is bad for journalism , bad for freedom of speech , and - vitally - appalling for the @entity2 public			2
" he added : " today @entity2 squandered a precious @entity132 fear that those who welcome press regulation now will regret it profoundly but too late			2
