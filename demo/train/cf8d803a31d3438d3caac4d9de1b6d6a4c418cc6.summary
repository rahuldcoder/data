-- it is a football fairytale even @entity3 scriptwriters might view as stretching the bounds of credibility			2
but in a dilapidated stadium in the north east of @entity11 , one club 's @entity7 dream came true on wednesday night			1
@entity12 , who had never before qualified for the group stages of the continent 's most lucrative competition , took down 1986 winners @entity17 in scarcely believable fashion			1
trailing 1 - 0 from the first leg in @entity21 , @entity12 snatched a dramatic last minute equalizer to take the knockout tie into extra time			1
with a penalty shootout looming , its goalkeeper @entity26 was sent off for a second yellow card			1
@entity21 - born defender @entity30 then donned the gloves , and safely guided his side through to the shootout			1
then the fireworks really began			2
not only did @entity30 score @entity12 ' opening kick , he then saved two @entity17 penalties to seal an incredible victory			1
" this is incredible , a dream			2
nobody could write such a story			1
i have no words to describe the feeling , " @entity30 , who used to play for @entity17 's rivals @entity41 , told @entity43 's official website			1
" it was the first time in my career i have played as a keeper			2
sometimes in training i pretend to be a goalie , but it is the first time i 've done it with gloves on			2
i relied on my instincts -- there is no other way in such a situation			0
" i was just taking last - second decisions on where to jump			0
thank @entity60 , i saved two and we are there			0
" @entity30 's heroics were made all the more remarkable given he performed them in front of legendary @entity17 goalkeeper @entity69 , the club 's honorary president			1
@entity69 made four successive saves in @entity17 's 1986 penalty shootout with @entity73 in the @entity7 final , delivering the trophy for his side			1
" @entity69 is the probably the greatest @entity21 goalkeeper , " @entity30 said			1
" i grew up with the stories about that final			0
" after the match , @entity12 coach @entity80 revealed @entity30 often has a go in goal during training			1
" sometimes during training sessions we practice penalties and he has a habit of going in goal for fun , " he said			2
" i asked him whether he wanted to take the gloves it and he agreed			0
" i told him not to jump prematurely and wait			0
he has a good instinct and reaction			0
but after all this is incredible			0
he has never even trained with gloves			0
" now it seems @entity12 ' regular goalkeeper @entity26 faces a fight to regain his place as no. 1 at the club			1
" yes , it seems we have too many goalkeepers in the team , " he joked			0
" i was not afraid when i saw him putting on the gloves			0
there is no guarantee i would have done better			0
" i have no words to describe this game			0
i had to make the foul , the @entity17 player was too quick			1
but this is our dream , this is the result of sweat and hard work			0
" @entity12 now takes its place in the draw on thursday alongside @entity123 powerhouses @entity122 -- the defending champions -- @entity73 , @entity125 and @entity126 .			2

@entity11 club @entity12 qualify for @entity7 group stages
defender @entity30 the hero after going in goal for the decisive penalty shootout
@entity30 scores his own penalty and then saves two from @entity17 players
" nobody could write such a story , " says @entity30 after the fairytale is *completed*
