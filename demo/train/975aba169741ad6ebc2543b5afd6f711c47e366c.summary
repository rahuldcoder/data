-- and in " @entity5 " @entity4 's sexiest spy seems to be on the verge of a midlife crisis : he 's stuck in a rut , feeling redundant and getting self - conscious about his age			1
he even considers early retirement , plunging to his apparent doom after he 's shot in the movie 's thunderously exciting pre-credit sequence			0
spoiler alert : 007 survives to fight another day , but not until he 's treated himself to an unofficial sabbatical , an opportunity for recuperation and introspection			0
not that anyone goes to a @entity1 movie for navel - gazing , but there 's definitely a more serious undercurrent this time around , a certain hankering after relevance that must surely be attributed to the presence of @entity30 - winning director @entity29			1
no disrespect to @entity32 , @entity33 and the rest , but @entity29 represents a step up in pedigree for a franchise that 's usually been the preserve of action specialists			1
photos : becoming @entity1 @entity29 is out to make more than just another @entity1 film , that much is clear			1
" @entity5 " features all the usual elements -- the chases , the girls , the arch villain -- but recalibrated with intelligence and a less smug , more searching sensibility			1
you might even detect a hint of @entity49 , the disenchanted , depressed 50 - something played by @entity51 in @entity29 ' " @entity49 , " in the disaffected and mildly disabled @entity1 played by @entity52 this time out			1
returning to @entity54 in its hour of greatest need , 007 ca n't shoot straight , fails his physical and his psych test , too			0
but @entity60 ( @entity59 ) knows he 's still the man for the job even if her latest government overseer ( @entity64 ) seems to think they 're both relics headed for the scrapyard			0
scripted by @entity1 specialists @entity68 and @entity68 , this time with a significant assist from @entity69 ( " @entity70 " ; " @entity83 " ) , " @entity5 " cobbles together bits and pieces from many another thriller , sometimes more loosely than we might like , and draws in particular from " @entity76 " -- but for my money @entity29 gets the balance between light and dark more nearly right than @entity81 managed in this year 's most overbearing blockbuster			1
this is a movie of gleaming surfaces -- veteran dp @entity86 turns a glass skyscraper at night into a funhouse hall of mirrors , and a floating @entity91 casino is like an oasis in the black sea			0
after all the globetrotting , " @entity5 " brings the action back home to @entity97 -- and @entity86 finds a different kind of beauty in the crags and lochs of @entity102			2
just on a pictorial level , it 's enticing in a way few @entity106 spectaculars can match			0
( the credit sequence alone is among the most lustrous in the entire 007 canon			0
) bond girls through the years @entity29 gambles big on a last act that cuts out all the gadgets and gizmos , brings everything down to bare bones and ties the action to @entity1 's own history			1
he pulls it off , in part because this apparently immortal series desperately needed someone to take a risk , and because @entity29 ' class really comes through in the performances			2
@entity59 is probably incapable of being bad , but @entity60 is a real character this time , with emotions , as well as convictions , and she hits every note just so			2
@entity128 is a breath of fresh air as a youthful q , and @entity52 himself remains the first 007 who might conceivably take down @entity133 in hand - to - hand combat			0
then there 's @entity136 , one - upping even his flamboyant psychopath from " @entity138			0
" the only thing banal about his villain @entity140 is his name			0
it would be a sin to say too much about this character -- discover him for yourself -- but @entity136 's @entity148 © performance is simply delicious			0
he 's a warped mama 's boy who fancies himself , whisper it , @entity1 's mirror image			2
it 's been a long time since i enjoyed a @entity1 movie so much			1
by taking a good hard look at itself and going back to first principles , " @entity5 " pulls off something quite special			2
this is @entity1 resurrected , redeemed and reinvigorated , ready to face a new half - century .			1

" @entity5 " marks the 50th year of the @entity1 franchise
@entity30 - winning director @entity29 helms the film
critic says it has been a long time since he has enjoyed a @entity1 film this much
