@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity3 accused of raping a 19 - year - old @entity1 woman last year was found guilty thursday of " committing wrongful sexual contact and indecent acts , " the @entity6 military said , but he was acquitted of rape			1
the sentencing hearing for @entity13 @entity12 , 20 , is scheduled to begin on friday			1
@entity12 is among four @entity3 under court - martial in the case			1
the others are sgt. @entity17 , 25 ; gunnery sgt. @entity19 , 39 ; and gunnery sgt. @entity20 , 34 , the military said			2
local media reported that the four men met the woman in a restaurant in @entity25 on october 14 , 2007 , then allegedly attacked and raped her in a car in nearby parking lot			0
@entity1 authorities investigated but decided in november not to file charges			0
@entity12 also was found guilty of conspiracy to commit indecent acts and two minor charges			0
he was acquitted of conspiracy to kidnap or rape			0
the case is similar to a recent alleged sexual assault of a 14 - year - old girl involving a @entity3 on the southern @entity1 island of @entity40			1
that case sparked outrage and stirred memories of an earlier rape committed by @entity6 servicemen			0
staff sgt. @entity47 , 38 , was charged last month with the rape of a child under 16 , abusive sexual contact with a child , making a false official statement , adultery and kidnapping , the military said			0
in february , @entity1 authorities released @entity47 after the girl dropped the allegations , but the @entity3 conducted its own investigation to see if @entity47 violated codes of military justice			1

more than 40,000 @entity6 troops are stationed in @entity1 , most of them on @entity40 , which accounts for less than 1 percent of @entity1 's total area			0

anti-american sentiment boiled over in 1995 , after three @entity6 servicemen were convicted in the kidnapping and gang rape of a 12 - year - old @entity40 schoolgirl			2
