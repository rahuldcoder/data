when vice president @entity0 and defense secretary @entity1 advised president @entity2 in late april 2011 that sending a @entity4 seal team into @entity5 to capture or kill @entity6 was not worth the various risks that this operation entailed , @entity9 , the president 's top counterterrorism adviser , urged the president to authorize the raid			1
it 's that kind of call that has made @entity9 the president 's go - to guy since the beginning of @entity2 's first term on all matters related to terrorism and has also thrust him into a broader policymaking role in the @entity22 and in @entity23			1
from his windowless office deep in the bowels of the @entity26 a few steps from the @entity28 , @entity9 has been at the center of every important decision in the war against @entity32			2
@entity9 is a serious , taciturn man who grew up in @entity33 and attended @entity34 in @entity35 , where at one point he contemplated becoming a priest			0
instead , he joined the @entity40 and spent more than two decades in the shadows , rising to take on important positions such as @entity44 's intelligence briefer and @entity40 station chief in @entity46			2
three years after 9/11 , @entity9 became the first director of the @entity48 , which shapes overall strategy against @entity32 and its allies across the 16 agencies of the @entity53 intelligence community			2
after he retired , @entity9 went into the private sector , where he played an early role in advising the @entity2 campaign in the run - up to the 2008 election			2
it 's this long history with @entity2 and his depth of experience in the intelligence community that have made @entity9 the president 's pick to run the @entity40			1
facing tough questions on thursday , @entity9 will testify before the @entity65 , a milestone on the road to what is shaping up to be a contentious confirmation to be @entity40 director			1
at his confirmation hearing , @entity9 will be asked some tough questions about the administration 's policies on @entity40 drone strikes , policies that he has played a key role in formulating			1
taking even the most conservative estimate of casualties during @entity9 's time as @entity2 's top counterterrorism adviser , @entity40 drone strikes in @entity5 have killed 1,577 people , 143 of whom were identified in credible news reports as civilians , according to a count by the @entity87			1
@entity9 will also likely be asked to discuss the still - classified @entity65 's three - year investigation into the @entity40 detainee program and the extent to which coercive interrogations of some of those @entity40 - held prisoners elicited useful information			1
the head of the committee , sen. @entity95 , @entity97 , has said that coercive interrogations did not provide key leads in tracking down @entity6 , while a number of retired senior @entity40 officials have claimed that they did			1
undoubtedly , this discrepancy will be something that the committee will want to delve into with @entity9			0
opinion : bring drones out of the shadows role in the raid perhaps more than any other official , he played a key role in what has surely been the @entity2 administration 's greatest success overseas : tracking @entity6 to an obscure city in @entity5 and then formulating the overall plan that led to the death of @entity32 's leader			1
in august 2010 , cia director @entity120 went to the @entity121 to brief the president and a handful of his top national security advisers , including @entity9 , that the @entity40 had a promising lead that suggested @entity6 could be living in a compound in the northern city of @entity128			1
the case that @entity6 was living there was entirely circumstantial and was based on the fact that residing at the @entity128 compound was a longtime @entity32 insider and that he and the other people living in the compound were taking elaborate measures to deceive their neighbors about their identities			0
one of the mysterious residents at the compound was a man who never left the compound 's grounds and could be seen by @entity53 satellites occasionally taking a quick walk in the garden			0
he would come to be nicknamed " the pacer			0
" however , the @entity40 could never get a photograph of the pacer 's face , nor was there any other definitive intelligence that @entity6 was living at the compound			1
@entity9 , who had spent almost all of his working life at the @entity40 , met regularly with the analysts working on the @entity6 case			1
according to senior @entity121 officials , @entity9 pushed the analysts to come up with intelligence that disproved the notion that @entity6 was living in the @entity128 compound , explaining , " i 'm tired of hearing why everything you say confirms your case			1
what we need to look for are the things that tell us what 's not right about our theory			0
so what 's not right about your inferences ? " the analysts working on the @entity6 hunt came back to the @entity121 one day and started their intelligence update , saying , " looks like there 's a dog on the compound			2
" @entity177 , @entity2 's then - deputy national security adviser , remembers thinking , " oh , that 's a bummer			1
you know , no self - respecting @entity179 's gon na have a dog			0
" ( many @entity179 believe dogs to be " unclean			0
" ) @entity9 , who had spent much of his career focused on the @entity22 and speaks @entity184 , pointed out that @entity6 , in fact , did have dogs when he was living in @entity187 in the mid- 1990s			2
( indeed , when @entity32 's leader was living in the capital of @entity190 , he had taken an interest in training police dogs			0
) report : numerous countries involved in @entity40 interrogation programs creation of the " @entity197 " in addition to pushing the @entity40 to refine its analysis of the case that @entity6 was living in @entity128 , two weeks before @entity2 made the final decision to launch the @entity203 raid , @entity9 authorized the formation of a " @entity197			1
" it was made up of four intelligence analysts who had had no prior role in making the case that @entity6 was living in @entity128			0
the role of the @entity197 was to see if there were alternative explanations that could explain the " pattern of life " of the mysterious residents of the @entity128 compound			0
for instance : could they be the retinue of some drug lord who was keeping a low profile ? or might they be on the fringes of @entity32 but unrelated to @entity6 himself ? on thursday , april 28 , 2011 , during the final @entity224 meeting to discuss what to do in @entity128 , the @entity197 briefed the president and his top advisers			2
one of the @entity197 analysts put the odds that @entity6 was living in @entity128 at 40 % , which was discomfiting to some			0
@entity9 recalls : " some of us thought , ' whoa ! we thought the prospects were higher that he was in there			0
' and the president recognized that when people were saying , ' well , there 's only 40 % of a chance , ' that some people were going to get a little bit soft on this			0
" was it too risky ? the uncertainty that @entity6 was even living in @entity128 contributed to the advice that @entity0 and @entity1 gave @entity2 during this final @entity224 meeting : do n't authorize the seal team raid			1
it 's just too risky			0
by now , @entity9 had come to a very different conclusion			0
he had already told the president privately the @entity40 officials who had developed the intelligence on @entity128 were " the people that have been following @entity6 for 15 years			2
this has been their life 's work , this has been their life 's journey , and they feel it very much in their gut that @entity6 is at that compound			2
i feel pretty good , if not certain , that @entity6 is at that compound			0
" @entity9 urged a go on the raid			0
as the @entity203 raid unfolded in @entity128 on may 1 , 2011 , @entity9 was as anxious as anyone else in the @entity261 : " might there be a quick reaction force that @entity6 may have had , security that we did n't know about ? " he recalled thinking			1
the raid , of course , succeeded			0
when photos of the dead @entity6 were passed around the @entity28 , @entity9 nodded and said , " it 's @entity6			1

@entity9 is up for a confirmation hearing before the @entity65 on thursday

@entity278 says @entity9 's been key in the drone program and in the @entity6 raid
