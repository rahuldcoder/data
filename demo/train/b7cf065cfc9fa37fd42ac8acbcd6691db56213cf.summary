@entity1 @entity0 8003 , @entity2 -- it takes a long time to get to the middle of nowhere			1
for a contingent of almost 40 reporters , hours of waiting both on land and then at sea preceded a trip to one of the world 's most hotly contested areas of maritime real estate			0
the @entity1 government had been at pains to keep this media trip under wraps , keeping print , online and broadcast journalists from @entity22 and the @entity23 guessing as to the day and time of departure			2
that secrecy may have been for naught : at a pre-departure briefing we are told that while the @entity1 @entity29 has not formally informed its @entity31 counterpart of the presence of journalists in the area , a @entity0 official mentions that " chances are " @entity31 knows about it			1
but depart we do , boarding a small coastguard support vessel monday evening as the sun dies over @entity39 , bound for the disputed waters surrounding the @entity2 's @entity41 , known to @entity31 as the @entity41			1
@entity31 's controversial installation of an oil - rig in these waters at the beginning of may sparked protests -- some of which turned violent -- in @entity1 and statements from a variety of world leaders , urging the two sides to resolve this dispute quickly and without bloodshed			1
one side , at least , appears to be in agreement			0
" the @entity1 @entity0 are committed to resolving the situation peacefully , " says @entity57 , the captain of the supply ship upon which we hitch a ride			2
strictly utilitarian , our sturdy ride boasts one 25mm cannon on its prow and two 14.5mm guns aft			0
it is the kind of supply ship that every coast guard needs , and also houses a huge number of plastic 10 - gallon jugs of drinking water , a galley piled with vegetables , and a bevy of live chickens under one of the exterior staircases -- supplies badly needed by their crew mates and friends on the front line			0
as the sun rises again the next morning , we 're still chugging steadily toward our destination , claimed by both @entity31 and @entity1			1
@entity1 boat sinks after collision with @entity31 vessel clear message a mid-sea ship change to @entity88 -- and slightly less cramped conditions -- awaits us as noon approaches			1
by then we have reached the area where @entity31 had , earlier in the month , unilaterally planted a flag on this area of supposedly oil rich sea			2
the flag , in this case , was an imposing oil - rig that sent a clear message : the @entity41 are ours to do with what we will			1
no buoys mark the territory , and there is no landfall in sight : just a shimmering expanse of deep water , albeit one with the promise of fossil fuel riches beneath			0
as we arrive news comes that the rig -- run by state - owned oil company the @entity112 's ( @entity112 ) -- has been moved : no small task for something as big and unwieldy -- yet politically volatile			2
the operation to move the structure began on monday morning and was completed by 10.30 p.m. local time , just hours after our voyage began but , equally , hours before we arrived in the zone			0
approaching the area , dots on the horizon become ships , which then become a flotilla -- or perhaps more accurately two separate flotilla -- of both @entity31 and @entity1 commercial and coast guard vessels			1
this mishmash of fishing and military vessels is all that remains of the flashpoint of a couple of weeks ago , and in a seemingly stage - crafted set of maneuvers dance around this expanse of utterly blue , clear sea			0
aggressive foghorns it 's a lively affair , alternating between angry , static - y rhetoric that informs the @entity31 that they are in violation of international law , and aggressive foghorns and sirens , raising a cacophony on this otherwise peaceful , sunny afternoon			0
" i 've traveled out to these waters many times but recently the @entity31 have been more aggressive towards the @entity1 , " says @entity57 , captain of the support vessel			1
" i 'm proud to protect @entity1			0
" the dance is supervised by the respective country 's coast guard vessels , who hopefully have too much sense to engage directly with each other			0
but hanging over the day 's events is the knowledge that just hours before , a @entity31 fishing vessel had rammed and sunk one of its @entity1 counterparts			1
no lives were lost in this incident but it is the first time that a boat has been sunk in this chapter of the often - acrimonious relationship between these two ideologically similar neighbors			0
as the afternoon begins to wrap up , one of the larger @entity31 coast - guard vessel homes in on our ship , horn blasting incoherently as it attempts a little maritime brinksmanship			2
nobody on board @entity88 seems to be overly worried , although life jackets are donned as a fillip			0
like a dog reaching the end of its chain , the @entity31 vessel barks at us a few remaining times , before turning heel			2
off the starboard bow , two other @entity31 vessels harry a smaller @entity1 fishing boat , pushing it further from the center of this disagreement which , if left untended , could have dramatic consequences for these two countries , key players in a region that is -- perhaps belatedly -- starting to buck under the weight of @entity31 hegemony .			1

@entity31 , @entity1 dispute the waters around the @entity41 in the @entity2
current tension came about after @entity31 moved an oil rig into the region
this week a @entity31 fishing vessel had rammed , sank one of its @entity1 counterparts
