-- " @entity3 " has a new lease on life			1
this time around , the hero of the 2009 film that lampooned blaxploitation movies is in animated form in a new series on @entity11 's @entity10 program block			1
some of the actors from the film will reprise their roles , but there will be changes as well			1
the movie , which enjoyed only a two - week theatrical release despite premiering at the @entity19 , was deliberately cheesy			1
to parody the cheap , hastily produced blaxploitation films , " @entity3 " actors intentionally chewed up scenery or performed awkwardly			1
there were telltale signs of a second - rate production , such as the appearance of a boom mike			2
the new " @entity3 " is still set in the 1970s , but the 10 - episode cartoon series is more like " shaft " than a sendup of blaxpoitation , said @entity32 , who supplies @entity3 's voice and serves as a producer			1
as in the film , the polyester pants suit - garbed @entity3 is a former @entity38 agent , a lover and a kung fu fighter			1
he has returned to the ' hood to combat evil and protect the children in the @entity44 , who are looked after by the working girls and their boss , sexy no - nonsense @entity49 ( @entity48 )			2
" the characters have to be a little bigger than life , but it 's a fun challenge , and the essence of the characters is still there , " said @entity50 , former executive producer of " @entity51 " on @entity10 , who serves as the director and an executive producer for " @entity3			1
" " obviously , with a cartoon , you can do more things than you can do in live action , " @entity50 said			2
" it opens a lot more doors for us to explore different characters and genres			2
" in one episode , @entity3 is hired to make sure comedian @entity71 shows up for a scheduled performance			1
in the story , @entity71 is distraught because audiences automatically laugh at him , making it hard to offer serious social commentary			2
" i wanted to take another perspective on @entity71 as a human being , " @entity50 said			2
" @entity71 never wanted to be funny			2
he had something to say			0
he was a teacher to me			0
" in another episode , a parody of " @entity82 , " @entity3 goes after an albino ape that scaled the iconic @entity85 in @entity86			1
@entity32 said he is n't concerned that , despite its late - night time period , the show could irritate those who think its frequent use of bleeped profanity and the prominence of prostitutes perpetuate unwelcome stereotypes of african - americans			0
" i do n't mind that at all , " @entity32 said			0
" this is a commentary on the time period			0
it is the truth that , at this time in the ' 70s , these were our heroes			0
" added @entity50 , " the main thing i focused on is being honest			0
this is a time when pimps , hos and hustlers existed , and they thrived within their communities			0
and @entity3 is trying to stop the negative things connected with that			1
" yes , @entity50 said , there is a whorehouse in the show , " but you never see them whoring			0
i made it a point not to show that			2
you 'll never see @entity3 pimping either , because that 's not what it 's about			1
this was just a way to give a different world a texture that actually existed in that era			0
" despite its short theatrical run , " @entity3 " the film drew a loyal following , and sales of the movie on @entity128 in 2010 were brisk			1
" i think it 's going to be off the chain with crazy fans , " predicted @entity48			2
" i did not know ' @entity3 ' was so popular			1
you go on the @entity132			0
you go down to @entity133 , and they fill the room			0
" @entity137 , the voice of @entity139 , @entity3 's cunning sidekick , agreed			1
" when i go to @entity142 ( in @entity86 ) or @entity143 , people say , ' man , we wish we would have known this was in the theaters at the time			0
' it just did n't work out that way			0
" @entity50 thinks young viewers will tune in for a fresh viewpoint , and older viewers will watch with a sense of nostalgia			0
" to me , it plays on so many different levels and on so many different platforms , " he said			0
" there are so many different ingredients that make it powerful for just about everybody			0
" " @entity3 " premieres at 11:30 p.m. et / pt july 15 on the @entity11 , which is owned by @entity0 's parent company .			1
