@entity0 -- the nuclear talks with the @entity3 -- that 's @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , the @entity8 and @entity9 -- this past week in @entity10 left much to be desired for @entity11 in terms of final outcomes			1
the joint action plan calls on @entity11 to take steps to verify the peaceful nature of its nuclear program			1
in return , it receives limited sanctions relief until a comprehensive solution within the year takes shape			0
but a deal is better than no deal as far as @entity26 is concerned , and here is why : the move preempts other power centers in @entity11			1
although president @entity30 rejected the idea , in the joint plan @entity26 admitted de facto that its nuclear program might be in non-compliance			1
the move preempts hardline factions in @entity11 from attempts to advance know - how to build a nuclear bomb			1
it wants a dignified solution			0
despite frequent proclamations to the contrary , @entity26 will commit to talks until a way out of the nuclear dilemma is found , even if a final deal takes a long while to make			1
until then , it can showcase its praiseworthy diplomatic skills			0
it wants the military option permanently off table			1
if @entity11 needs nuclear energy and has the capacity to produce the fuel , then an agreement that allows it to enrich nuclear fuel is not only necessary , but also reduces the chance of a military strike against @entity11 's nuclear facilities			1
that is why it insists on enrichment			0
it wants to fortify the conservative power - base			0
without a deal , that prospect is in jeopardy because rival political factions in @entity11 will undermine @entity30 's conservative camp			1
already , the joint action plan has come under attack by hardline sources who told @entity74 , linked to former president @entity75 , that it degrades @entity11 's nuclear rights			1
it wants to re-define " @entity78			0
" @entity26 ca n't control those chants			0
they aim to sabotage talks but also bring tactical pressure on the @entity3 to deliver on its end of the bargain			0
@entity26 wants talks to move forward regardless			0
that is why interior minister @entity86 told @entity88 news agency that the chant means @entity11 supports talks			1
while that surely confuses any @entity8 , the vast majority of @entity11 rejoice in what is implied , that @entity26 is ready for a deal with the enemy			1
it wants to keep hardliners happy			2
there is a national consensus to resolve the nuclear crisis , according to hardline papers @entity100 and @entity101			2
to reciprocate the favor , @entity26 has n't rejected their calls to exercise " resistance diplomacy , " a term branded to push @entity26 to remain defiant in the nuclear talks			2
@entity26 paid lip - service to the cause while it advanced the talks			0
that means it knows it must " eat bread based on its daily currency , " to be able to " tie the devil 's hand behind its back , " as two @entity118 proverbs go			0
a deal which revamps @entity11 's economy and generates hard cash is a good one , even if it happens slowly			1
the head of @entity11 's @entity124 and @entity125 told @entity127 news agency the country will stick with talks until all sanctions are lifted , which the joint plan promises to do through a later comprehensive solution			1
he also told @entity135 news agency that parliament will make the endorsement of decisions with the @entity3 conditional on removing sanctions			0
it wants its three - tier proposal to get a fair chance			0
the action plan reflects some of the language of the @entity11 proposal which was presented and ignored early this month in @entity10			1
this includes recognizing a step - by - step process to end the nuclear dispute , and the reversibility of an agreement if all its provisions are not fully met			2
this proposal gives @entity26 and other parties a chance to step back and weigh new options if progress in talks falls short of expectations			0
it wants a deal before the next @entity8 presidential race			2
@entity26 does not want to rush talks in order to maximize the advantages of a final deal			2
but it knows the best opportunity for a good deal is until next november when campaigning for the 2016 presidential election can knock other priorities down the list			2
although it risks tying the fate of the nuclear talks to its relations with the @entity8 , @entity26 is prepared to take that chance			2
that is why , in an interview with @entity26 - based @entity127 , its foreign minister @entity175 said he was ready for the next round of talks to begin right away			0
it wants to activate its regional diplomacy			0
@entity26 de-linked the nuclear talks from other regional issues including @entity182 , but remained open to discussing them with the @entity3			0
it paid the price and ignored its neighbors in the process , including @entity187 and @entity188 who have stakes in @entity182 , for a higher gain : to limit the impact of its conflicts in the region on its nuclear file			1
with an initial plan now in place , @entity26 can revamp its regional diplomacy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			1

@entity200 : @entity11 has many things to gain
she says it can help keep various sides in @entity11 happy
it limits nuclear *weapon* *development* at home
and the deal reduces the *likelihood* of military action from *abroad*
