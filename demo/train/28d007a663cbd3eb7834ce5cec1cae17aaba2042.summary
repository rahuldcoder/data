-- take a pair of hi - fi speakers , an old radio , a couple of dvd players and countless other household appliances , apply some ingenuity and what do you get ? if you 're @entity11 , an ex-cop turned robot maker , you get @entity13 -- a four foot , three - inch tall humanoid robot			1
" frankly , i think of it as a very large toy			2
i think that mindset helped me get the build done , because it 's such a daunting task , " said @entity11			1
four years in the making , it 's been as much art project as engineering feat , he says , requiring the visualization of the various body parts			2
" the legs are made from outdoor speakers -- they 're gorgeous			2
his shoulders are made from fans , his forearms from power tools			2
the chest and back are made from kid 's riding toys and his head is a clock radio			1
i also employed a @entity39 printer for the hands , using a combination of the @entity43 open - source design and my own artistic expression , " the 49 - year - old from @entity46 explains			1
" there are so many diverse parts on the machine that it would take me all day to tell you			0
it was a really complex build , but i love this machine and i 'm anxious to build another			0
" the self - taught roboticist has drawn inspiration from @entity57 's @entity56 robot and @entity59 's @entity58 as well as sounding out opinion at his local hackerspace			1
assembling @entity13 has cost the proverbial arm and a leg -- " tens of thousands of dollars , " says @entity11 -- and is controlled remotely using a @entity65 usb dongle attached to his laptop			1
" he can step unsupported , but it 's not completely stable -- i have a slight problem with joint compliance at the moment			0
but his hands are fully functional , his legs are functional and he has 23 degrees of freedom			0
" it 's all a far cry from @entity11 's previous life as a police officer -- serving the @entity77 for over two decades before retiring in 2006			1
" i really enjoyed being a cop ... i wanted to go out and lock up the bad guys and that 's what i did			0
but policing completely takes over your life			0
that 's one of the reasons i got out , " he says			0
the death of his father three years later prompted @entity11 to re-evaluate his life and in looking for a new path he turned back to an old passion			1
" i grew up very poor in @entity46 and every @entity94 my mother used to purchase toy robots for me -- the kind that shuffled across the floor , spun around with lights flashing			1
i thought they were the most marvelous things on the planet			0
" not content playing with them , @entity11 would pull them apart and put them back together in differing configurations			1
it helped numb the pain of poverty , he says , while also keeping him out of trouble -- a trick he 's hoping to pull off for a new generation of kids			2
@entity11 has already introduced @entity13 to the robotics club at @entity46 's @entity113 and plans future visits to other schools and clubs in the city			1
" because of the crime problems in @entity46 , it 's a perfect opportunity to try and snatch some children back from the abyss			1
it 's a really beautiful thing to be able to introduce robotics to kids			2
" to help spread the message , and the cost , @entity11 is launching a @entity131 campaign			2
the money raised will be used to iron out flaws as well as document the entire process -- " so anyone can see every nut , bolt and screw , " he says			0
" it 's full speed ahead for me now			0
this was trial by fire			0
i chose the most difficult thing a person could build and i 've learned so much that my brain is just brimming now and ready to go			0
i 'm excited for the future			0
