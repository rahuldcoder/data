-- color is coming to the @entity2			2
at least that 's what the tech blogosphere expects to happen on wednesday at an @entity7 press conference			2
the maker of the world 's most popular e-book reader is rumored to be announcing a color , touch - screen tablet device called the " @entity16 , " according to the blog @entity14 , which claims to have seen the gadget			1
here are the @entity16 's specs , according to that site and others : -- 7 - inch color screen , compared to 6 - inch for current @entity21 -- @entity22 only ( no 3g version ) -- touch - screen navigation -- glowing led screen instead of paper - like e-ink -- @entity29 operating system -- hits stores in november -- current @entity2 will remain on sale the @entity2 tablet is remarkably similar to @entity35 's @entity34 tablet , says @entity36 at the blog @entity38 , and that 's because both were built and designed by the same manufacturing company			1
@entity36 , who cites unnamed sources , says @entity7 used the design for the unpopular @entity35 tablet as a starting point			1
even though details about the device have n't been confirmed , @entity36 and other bloggers are already throwing water on the @entity16			0
" although @entity7 did refresh the id of their @entity34 derivative , i 'm told that this first tablet of theirs is ' supposed to be pretty poor ' and is a ' stopgap ' in order to get a tablet out the door for the 2011 holiday season -- which does n't exactly leave the best taste in my mouth , " he writes			2
" but it 's also not the most uncommon story , either : when you 're breaking into a new market , sometimes you have to do whatever it takes to get in the game			0
you may remember how crappy the original @entity2 was compared to later models ! " three major magazine companies have signed on to provide content for the new @entity2 tablet , according to @entity71 at the blog network @entity72 , which is owned by the @entity74			0
@entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 will sell digital versions of their magazines on the upcoming @entity2 tablet ; but @entity81 , which shares a parent company with @entity0 , will not settle on a deal this week , @entity71 says			0
all of this is just conjecture for now , of course			0
@entity7 's press conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. wednesday in @entity88			1
many details should become clearer then			0
@entity90 , one of @entity7 's competitors in e-books , is expected to announce a new version of its @entity96 e-reader later this year .			1
