-- with the passing of @entity3 earlier this month , the tech industry lost one of its most revered icons			1
so where will the industry turn for inspiration now that @entity3 is gone ? new @entity10 ceo @entity9 will keep the business cranking along , but he 's unlikely to inspire the same kind of devotion as @entity3			1
@entity15 leader @entity14 has star power , but he and his company are still too young and untested			0
at @entity19 , @entity18 is too awkward and @entity20 too slick , and a lot of the company 's recent products are too unfinished			0
but there 's one tech leader who just might fit the bill : @entity28 's @entity27			1
@entity27 runs his business the same way @entity3 ran his , with a relentless focus on long - term value over short - term profits and a willingness to place big bets in seemingly unrelated new areas			1
@entity3 took @entity10 on a detour from personal computers into music with the @entity40 , and then into cell phones with the @entity42			1
it worked , and made @entity10 into the biggest and richest tech company in the world			1
@entity27 is doing the same thing at @entity28			1
about five years ago , @entity28 noticed it had a lot of spare capacity in its data centers that was only used during the holiday season			2
so it started renting out some of that capacity to other companies			0
now hundreds of high - profile @entity52 startups , including big names like @entity55 and @entity56 , run their businesses on @entity58			0
somehow , an online bookseller became the most important provider of " cloud computing " -- a fancy term for running other companies ' online services			0
in 2007 , @entity28 introduced its electronic reader , the @entity66			2
the product limped along for a couple of years , then started to take off in 2010 with the third generation			0
but next month @entity28 will unveil @entity70 , a color version that is more like a full tablet computer , with an app store , music store , video store , and new kind of web browser designed to load web pages faster			1
and it sells for $ 199 , which is hundreds of dollars less than @entity10 's @entity79			2
no wonder @entity28 is having to build millions more than it expected to meet demand			2
somehow , an online bookseller could become one of the dominant players in tablet computing			0
@entity27 not only resembles @entity3 in his business practices			1
he 's also got a lot of the same personal traits			0
he 's a control freak @entity19 engineer @entity89 , who formerly worked at @entity28 , accidentally published a post criticizing his current employer and praising @entity28 and @entity27			1
( the post was supposed to be for @entity19 's eyes only			0
) he said @entity27 was a micromanager who " made ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies			2
" a @entity97 profile in 2009 said @entity27 wanted to know the details of every contract @entity28 signed and had to sign off on how he was quoted in every press release			1
he does n't like dissent @entity27 often tells employees that they 're lucky to work at @entity28 and leaves sticky notes reminding them who 's in charge if they disagree with him , according to @entity89			1
he has otherworldly smarts in a follow - up post , @entity89 explained how @entity27 was so smart that you could only impress him in presentations if you deleted every third paragraph to keep his brain occupied -- and even then , he 'd figure out something you missed			2
" people like @entity27 are better regarded as hyper - intelligent aliens with a tangential interest in human affairs			2
" he always wanted to change the world according to a 1999 profile in @entity123 , a high school girlfriend says that @entity27 wanted to make money from an early age , but not to be rich -- he wanted to use the money to change the future			2
he is obsessed with secrecy some companies are like leaky sieves -- @entity131 ca n't keep an internal secret to save its life , and @entity19 and @entity15 products leak all the time			0
the tech press publishes all sorts of rumors about @entity10 , but most of them turn out to be wrong because the company places a high premium on secrecy			0
but @entity28 is even more secretive than @entity10			1
he was born in hard circumstances @entity3 was born to a young mother out of wedlock and given up for adoption			0
@entity27 was born to a teenage mother whose marriage to his biological father lasted little more than a year			0
( @entity27 has his adopted father 's last name and considers him his real father , just as @entity3 considered his adoptive parents his real parents			1
) to be sure , there are some major differences between the two men			0
@entity3 dropped out of liberal arts college @entity159 and bummed around for a few years before figuring out what to do with his life ; @entity27 graduated from @entity163 and went straight to work on @entity164			1
@entity3 had a bit of the @entity167 hippie in him , practicing @entity168 and trying natural remedies to cure his cancer ; @entity27 is more of a classic computer scientist , obsessed with space travel and mechanically adept			1
most important , @entity28 has n't yet created many products that inspire the kind of love that the @entity40 , @entity42 and @entity79 do			0
there are n't any @entity28 fans -- or at least they 're nowhere near as obsessed as @entity10 's			1
but give @entity27 another five years and a few more new product areas , and that might change , too			0
