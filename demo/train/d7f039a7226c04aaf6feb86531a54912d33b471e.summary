@entity0 , @entity1 -- the next time a married man or woman glances your way , you might think twice before acting on impulse and frolicking between satin sheets			2
the scorned spouse could sue you			1
yes , you read that right			2
you , the paramour , can get hit with a lawsuit that could cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars			1
they 're known as " alienation of affection " suits , when an " outsider " interferes in a marriage			1
the suits are allowed in seven states : @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
the law allowing such legal action dates back to antiquated times when a wife was considered the property of a husband			1
a broken - hearted hubby could go after his wife 's lover -- not with a gun , but with the law			1
in modern times , the suits are filed for two reasons : money and revenge			1
juries in @entity24 have handed out awards in excess of $ 1 million on multiple occasions			2
" if your spouse is going to cheat , you really would like them to cheat with somebody who has a lot of money , " says @entity47 , a @entity24 divorce attorney who deals with alienation of affection cases on a daily basis			1
and that 's why many legal experts are paying close attention to the @entity60 saga			1
will his wife go after an alleged mistress ? were any of his " transgressions " with someone who is married ? if so , the jilted hubby might be able to go after the world 's richest golfer			1
it does n't matter that @entity60 lives in @entity70 , a state where the suits are n't allowed , legal experts say			1
if any of @entity60 ' professed " sins " took place in an alienation of affection state , look out			1
" if he had been dating a married woman , there could be the potential for a lucrative recovery , " @entity47 says			2
" you 've got to have a really affluent paramour that makes for a good target			1
" the suits rarely make it to trial			2
usually , just the threat of such a lawsuit is enough for an out - of - court settlement			0
click through a gallery of famous sex scandals " when folks are getting divorced , the threat of having the person 's new boyfriend , girlfriend , husband or wife dragged into court and the dirty laundry aired ... causes enormous pressure , " says @entity93 , a law professor at @entity94			2
@entity22 has been rocked by a high - profile suit , filed this summer , involving everything from allegations of ski resort trysts to a secret journal ordered kept under seal by a judge			0
better yet , it involves a congressman who once co-sponsored legislation for president @entity115 to declare 2008 the " @entity116			0
" the son of a prominent federal judge in @entity22 , @entity117 was the rising @entity119 star of the state -- hand - picked to succeed @entity121 in the @entity122			0
@entity117 decided not to run for re-election in 2008 after 12 years in the @entity125			0
at the time , he said he wanted to spend more time with his family			0
he 's married with five children			0
like a tale from @entity131 , who penned many a book on @entity22 elite with personal flaws , @entity117 's tumble has been staggering			0
" @entity117 has fallen far faster than the surrender of @entity141 , " @entity93 says , referring to a key turning point in the @entity136 , when @entity137 gave up the @entity139 town			0
the real doozy came july 14 , when @entity143 filed the alienation of affection suit against her husband 's alleged lover , a socialite named @entity148			1
" as a direct and proximate result of the negligent , wrongful and reckless misconduct and behavior of @entity148 with @entity117 , " the suit says , " plaintiff has suffered damage to the affection and consortium with her husband			1
" so hush - hush is the case , lawyers on both sides have reached a confidential agreement to not discuss the case publicly			0
the suit , in effect , has branded the once - proud congressman with a @entity166 " " he had certainly fallen from the pinnacle of his professional life and his public life , but it had not yet become a public disgrace , " @entity93 says			0
" and what this lawsuit did is it turned a fall into a disgrace			0
" " there 's a particular cast of tragedy when people are undone , not by accidental misfortune , but by their own character defects			0
" watch : are men programmed to cheat ? most states have abolished alienation of affection lawsuits			1
proponents in the holdout states say the threat of such legal action helps protect the sanctity of marriage			1
but , @entity93 and @entity47 say , alienation of affection suits do just the opposite : they result in already contentious divorces getting even more heated , and they leave behind a public trail of personal shortcomings and wild tales of infidelity			1
" to allow these suits to go forward , " @entity93 says , " is destructive to family life			2
" " it 's much like dropping a nuclear bomb on a family , " @entity47 says			0
" it really does damage the relationship between spouses			0
if there are children involved , it 's devastating for them			0
" it would require legislative action for states to change the law			2
and anyone who tries that in a conservative state could get painted as a pro-divorce lawmaker who holds cheaters less accountable			0
" it 's a very delicate matter legislatively , " @entity93 says			0
and as long as the law remains on the books , @entity47 says , he 'll keep busy : " we have an obligation to pursue our clients ' rights			0
" there is one way to avoid such suits : respect marital vows .			2

seven states allow for a scorned spouse to sue a paramour
the " alienation of affection " suits stem from days when a wife was considered property
some in legal circles are *monitoring* the @entity60 saga as a result
