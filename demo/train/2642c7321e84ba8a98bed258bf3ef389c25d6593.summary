@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 saved @entity5 's career			1
so said the filmmaker ( and you can throw a few slashes after that title these days ) at the @entity10 here on monday during a panel called , appropriately , " @entity13 of @entity5			1
" " i had no idea , but that would become the f --- ing center of everything i 'm doing now , " said @entity5 , who broke into moves after making 1994 's indie hit " clerks " for roughly $ 25,000			1
" the ultimate freedom that allowed me to walk away from the ' heroin ' [ money ] of the movie business -- what gave me the strength to walk away -- was [ expletive ] podcasting			1
" @entity5 said he was working on " @entity29 , " which he wrote and directed , when he realized the passion that led him to make movies like " @entity32 " and " @entity33 " was gone			1
" for a while i became a filmmaker and for a while a professional director , " he said			0
" but i really felt like i 'm an artist			0
" @entity5 said he decided to take advantage of his access to celebrities and gift of gab to launch a new project			1
and he deployed a technique he said has always served him well : do what you love and what you 're good at , then figure out how to make money doing it			0
and that led to " @entity48 , " a weekly podcast that he and friend / co-producer @entity50 launched in 2007 and do to this day			1
but as its online audience grew , the opportunities to make money arose			0
" people would tweet left and right : ' you put out so many free podcasts ; how can i pay it back ? ' " said @entity5 , who has more than 2 million followers on @entity58			1
" i was like , ' go buy a t - shirt ' and they were like , ' cool			0
' " then came paid advertising			2
( the first sponsor notoriously being adult product @entity69 )			0
then a paid version of the podcast , " @entity73 , " which contains bonus features but no ads. then he and @entity50 took the show on the road , selling out venues and selling merchandise along the way			0
@entity5 now heads up a @entity48 network of funny and sometimes raunchy internet radio shows			1
in a way , the podcasting model is a logical extension for @entity5 , who took to the internet early			1
in the mid- ' 90s , a friend told him he had to go see a website someone had created for " clerks			2
" @entity5 had to go to an @entity91 © to view it			2
and as he admitted monday , he was n't exactly web savvy			0
" i was like @entity94 in ' @entity95 , ' " he said			0
" i was like , ' @entity96 ! take me to ' @entity97 ' ! " @entity98 , who now appears on @entity5 's reality show " @entity100 , " had created the site			2
@entity5 quickly hired him to make an official one for his production company , @entity102			2
before long , it had a message board with more than 200,000 registered users -- a huge number on the internet of the ' 90s -- and it established @entity5 as one of the first filmmakers with a major online presence			2
" in terms of filmmakers , it was me and ( " @entity118 " director ) @entity116 on the @entity117 , " he said			0
then , one day , he said ' i 'm going to get offline and go make classics ' and i was like , ' i 'll stay here			0

@entity5 : after i lost my passion for film , podcasting saved my career
