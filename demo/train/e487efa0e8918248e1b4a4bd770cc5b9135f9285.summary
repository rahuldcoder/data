tired of our streets being peppered with dead , unarmed black people			1
tired of listening to armed assailants describe how they feared for their lives			2
tired of being told " this has nothing to do with race			1
" i am tired of having to march to have murderers arrested			2
tired of worrying about my 17 - year - old being gunned down by some random white guy who thinks his music is too loud			1
tired of knowing the same could happen to me			2
i am tired of seeing a hashtag in front of a victim 's name on @entity18			1
tired of seeing @entity19 speak on behalf of a family			2
tired of waiting for verdicts and hoping for justice -- as if hearing " guilty " can ease the anxiety of knowing a police officer shot and killed a 22 - year - old black man while he was lying face down and with his hands behind his back			1
i 'm tired of the cynics who are quick to extend the benefit of the doubt to a gunman but hesitant to do the same for an unarmed teenage girl who had been shot in the face			1
i am tired of seeing images of police officers with snarling dogs threatening a crowd of black protesters and not knowing if it 's from the 1960s or last week			2
in the case of @entity43 's death in @entity44 , @entity45 , it 's the latter			0
witnesses said he was shot multiple times from 35 feet away after his hands were raised			0
again , he was unarmed			0
i am tired of the @entity51 @entity50 having to closely watch local authorities			1
i am tired of local authorities advocating for @entity54 one minute and dismissing the notion of racial profiling the next			2
i am tired of the charlatans who chase the bodies of innocent victims the way sleazy lawyers chase ambulances			1
i hate black looters at peaceful rallies the way i hate the @entity65			0
i do n't want to get shot by a police officer			0
and i 'm tired of thinking that each time one walks by			1
i do n't begrudge anyone who has the luxury of not knowing what that kind of siege feels like			0
i just hope they have the decency not to characterize the socioeconomic disparity along racial lines as a card to be played but rather recognize it as a looming element of our cultural fiber			0
for example , from 1934 to 1962 , the federal government backed $ 120 billion of home loans			0
because of an appraisal system that deemed integrated communities financial risks , less than 2 % of those loans went to minorities			0
when you consider that home ownership has long been the prerequisite for the average @entity51 to acquire wealth , there is little wonder why white @entity51 have 22 times more wealth than blacks			2
that is not a card being played			0
that is math. and i 'm tired of having to explain that			1
just as i 'm tired of watching the video of @entity102 being placed in a chokehold by @entity104 , listening to him say " i ca n't breathe , i ca n't breathe " and then watching him die minutes later			1
but i need to keep watching because apathy is a clever hunter			0
it cloaks itself with @entity110 statistics and slips into the system between runs to @entity114			0
then one day as you 're sipping your grande decaf mocha , you see a headline about an unarmed black man being shot and killed by police and think nothing of it			0
or worse yet -- assume he did something to deserve it			0
i 'm tired of unarmed dead black people being put on trial			1
i 'm tired of politicians visiting our churches for votes but skipping out on these funerals i 'm tired of hearing mothers and fathers weep for children who did not have to die			1
but most of all i 'm tired of the people who are not tired like me .			1

@entity138 : i 'm tired of seeing @entity139 - @entity51 die as innocent , unarmed shooting victims
he says we *'ve* had enough of saying race is n't a factor and of ignoring racial disparities
@entity138 : it 's too easy for people to become *apathetic* and accept *injustice*
@entity152 : i 'm tired of parents weeping for children who did not have to die
