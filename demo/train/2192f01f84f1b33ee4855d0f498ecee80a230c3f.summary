the 24 - year - old was convicted and sentenced on charges of having unlawful sex , making a false statement and illegal consumption of alcohol			0
her story is dominating the headlines in @entity1 , and has raised serious questions over the way women who allege sexual assault are treated in the @entity18			1
@entity0 , who had been working at an interior design firm in @entity20 since september 2011 , told @entity21 on saturday how a work trip to @entity3 in march with three colleagues turned into a nightmare			1
she said she had been out at a bar with her colleagues and friends , and asked a male colleague to walk her to her room when they returned at 3 a.m. to the hotel			0
she 'd asked him to escort her because the hotel was large and confusing , and she did n't want to be wandering on her own , knowing she 'd been drinking , she said			0
when they reached a room , she realized it was n't hers -- but the man then pulled her inside despite her vocal objections , according to @entity0			1
" he dragged me by my purse in , so i thought , ' ok , i just need to calm the situation down			0
i will finish my bottle of water , i will sit here and then i will excuse myself and say i feel fine , ' " she said			0
that was pretty much the last thing she said she remembers before the alleged sexual assault			0
" i woke up with my clothes off , sleeping on my belly , and he was raping me			0
i tried to get off , i tried to get him off , but he pushed me back down			0
" after someone knocked -- the hotel wake - up call -- she managed to get dressed and make it downstairs to the hotel reception , @entity0 said			1
" i called the police			0
that is what you do			0
we are trained on that from when we are very young , " she said			0
some 10 or 12 male police officers arrived , but no female police officers were present , she said			0
statements were taken from both @entity0 and the alleged rapist			1
she was then taken to @entity3 police station , she said			1

a piece of paper with @entity97 text was handed to her , she said			0

it was the first time she was made aware that she faced charges , @entity0 said			2
she was allowed out on bail and has been staying since at the @entity1 @entity112 in @entity3			1
subsequently , she said her manager advised her to tell the police it was voluntary sexual intercourse and likely the whole issue would just go away			0
she followed the advice and in one of the many hearings at the public prosecutor 's office , she made a statement saying it was voluntary			0
@entity0 was then charged with making a false statement			2
" that was my biggest regret because it was n't voluntary			0
i just thought it would all go away , " she told @entity21			2
but a representative of @entity126 , who @entity0 worked for , told @entity21 that she was not advised by her manager to say the sex was consensual but rather by a police officer , who told her that in @entity97 and it was translated into @entity131 by her manager			1
@entity0 said a month after the rape , while forced to stay in @entity3 as the case wound through the legal system , she was fired			1
the representative , who declined to be publicly identified , said @entity0 and the @entity137 man she accused -- who is married with three children -- have both been terminated by @entity126 for " drinking alcohol at a staff conference that resulted in trouble with the police			1
" a statement released late saturday by @entity126 spokesman @entity144 said the company was sympathetic to @entity0 " during this very difficult situation			2
" it also said that company representatives were by her side through the initial investigation , spending " days at both the police station and the prosecutor 's office to help win her release			2
" " only when ms. @entity0 declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status , and ceased communication with her employer , was the company forced to end our relationship with her , " the statement said			2
" the decision had nothing to do with the rape allegation , and unfortunately neither ms. @entity0 nor her attorneys have chosen to contact the company to discuss her employment status			2
