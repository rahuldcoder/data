but it took a vet visit for @entity4 to take matters into her own hands and help the feline conquer her battle of the bulge			2
" i did n't really think about it as a problem , but when the vet started talking about the risk of diabetes , i realized we had to do something , " @entity10 says			1
" those are really scary words			0
" changing a cat 's diet can be risky , so @entity10 worked with her vet to gradually reduce @entity1 's daily kibble intake			1
unfortunately , there was another challenge to overcome			0
in a household with three cats , she wanted a way to feed each without setting up separate feeding areas			1
@entity10 did a little online research and settled on a high - tech cat door called @entity33			2

in about two weeks , her crew adjusted to the new setup , which included a separate container large enough for each cat			2
also , the doors currently come in only one size , so @entity1 had a bit of an issue squeezing through the tight space			2

" we do n't have to worry about that anymore			0
