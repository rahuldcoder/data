-- i once took care of an 84 - year - old woman with end - stage heart failure who told me she could n't bear feeling short of breath any longer and pleaded with me to help her die			1
" is november 15 a good day for you ? " she asked			1
her daughter shot out of a chair at her bedside			2
" @entity10 , do you understand what you are saying ? " the old lady stared at her and nodded slowly			2
" i ca n't take it anymore , " she said			2
" back and forth , back and forth to the hospital			2
i 'd rather be dead			0
" i explained that in @entity17 i could not assist in her suicide , though i could give her morphine to relieve her suffering			2
" if you were like me , you 'd say the same thing , doctor , " she said ruefully			0
" i 'm half gone			0
nobody wants to bother with you when you 're like this			0
" a couple of days later , i went to the ethics committee at my hospital			0
i explained that surgeons had deemed my patient 's condition inoperable			1
over the past couple of months she had been hospitalized several times with extreme shortness of breath due to congestive heart failure and treated with intravenous drugs			0
when the drugs were stopped , her heart failure symptoms quickly returned			0
this cycle was repeated several times before the day she asked me to help her die			1
" she just does n't want to suffer anymore , " i said			0
" she does n't want to go through another episode of heart failure			0
she is absolutely terrified of it			0
" " i do n't see the big ethical dilemma , " a senior internist said			0
" put her on a morphine drip to relieve her suffering			0
" " but she is n't currently suffering , " i replied			0
" so put her on a low dose and titrate it up when she develops symptoms			0
" the problem was that she could go into a heart failure exacerbation very quickly			0
she could suffer for hours before her shortness of breath was brought under control , and that was in the hospital where nurses were with her around the clock			0
in the end , i put my patient on a morphine drip			2
with her and her family 's permission , we arranged for home hospice care			1
but she never made it out of the hospital			0
i thought of this patient when reading a terribly sad column on @entity0 by @entity77 , a 29 - year - old with brain cancer who moved to @entity80 so she can legally get a prescription for a drug that will end her life			1
unfortunately , there are examples ( though rare ) where palliative or hospice care can not adequately address the anxiety and suffering of dying patients			1
for example , in the case of my elderly patient , how can one start morphine in a patient who is n't suffering at that precise moment ? for such patients in those rare cases , i support assisted suicide as practiced in @entity80			1
through @entity80 's @entity100 , passed in 1997 , more than 1,100 people have obtained life - ending prescriptions			2
about 750 have used them			0
the law does provide safeguards against clinically depressed or mentally incompetent patients getting lethal drugs to end their lives			0
four other states have enacted similar laws			0
however , i still believe that for most terminally ill patients , hospice care is a better option than assisted suicide			1
hospice offers team - based care with family involvement , often in a patient 's home , that focuses on pain management and dying with some comfort and dignity			1
hospice staff is available 24 hours a day , seven days a week			2
the modern hospice movement started in 1967 , when @entity123 , a nurse , opened @entity124 in @entity125			2
@entity126 formulated three principles for easing the process of dying : relief of physical pain , preservation of dignity , and respect for the psychological and spiritual aspects of death			1
the number of @entity140 hospitals offering palliative care has nearly doubled since 2000 , growing to nearly 1,500 programs -- the majority of hospitals			2
perhaps the most surprising finding from these programs is that hospice patients live a month longer on average than similar patients who do not receive such care			1
unlike hospice care , assisted suicide is obviously a final and irreversible act			1
ruling out the presence of clinical depression that may cloud a patient 's judgment is not always straightforward			1
when depression lifts , the desire to die often lifts too			1
only between 10 % and 15 % of people who attempt suicide eventually die by their own hands , suggesting that the desire to die is often changeable			1
as a doctor , i would like assisted suicide to be safe and available , but rare			1
managing end - of - life care for patients like @entity77 is never simple			1
i often think of what the elderly woman with terminal heart disease who asked me to help her die told me : " my husband said the hardest thing to do is to die ; i always thought it would be easy			1

dr. @entity175 says patient asked him for help dying ; daughter was *horrified*
he says he gets terminal patient @entity77 's desire to die , supports choice in rare cases
but he says hospice care better option for terminally ill ; allows dignity , comfort of home , family
@entity175 : @entity191 may cloud patient 's judgment . when it lifts , so may desire for suicide
