-- as the dust settled over @entity3 and @entity4 on thursday amid relative calm , analysts were weighing who were the winners and losers from the conflict			1
how do the main players in the region now stack up ? @entity4 : the conflict represents a qualified victory for the country and its prime minister @entity15 , according to @entity0 's @entity16			1
" just months before an election , @entity15 's government targeted and killed @entity20 ' military leader , @entity19			2
hundreds of airstrikes on @entity3 followed , but , the real victory was possibly the combat debut of @entity24 , the @entity25 - funded defense shield that kept dozens of @entity20 rockets from hitting @entity4 civilians			1
" the @entity4 military itself said the intensity of its airstrikes on @entity3 meant it made a significant dent in @entity20 ' offensive capability			1
over the eight - day conflict , the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) looked to deplete some of the estimated 12,000 rockets it says @entity20 has in its arsenal and destroy tunnels that are said to be used to smuggle weapons			2
but some analysts questioned whether the death of @entity19 really would benefit @entity4			2
@entity43 , from the @entity42 - based @entity41 , told @entity0 she believed it was in fact a mistake			0
" it will lead to the proliferation of extremist groups ( in @entity3 ) , less control over rocket attacks and an increase in violence against @entity4			0
" analysis : conflict shifts balance of power in the @entity56 @entity57 controlled the militias with an iron grip , as @entity60 , for the @entity42 - based @entity61 , pointed out			2
" there were people in @entity20 jails for firing rockets at the wrong time and @entity19 was one of the guys who put them in jail			0
now when someone decides to take a pot - shot , they can take a pot - shot			0
" the background of the conflict took place in a region greatly changed since the last significant violence of 2008 - 09			0
in the @entity80 's @entity79 , @entity78 wrote that the @entity81 had changed the situation significantly for @entity4 : " once it could afford to retreat into a default position of using overwhelming force in its own defence			2
after all , the @entity87 dictators it faced were equally unflinching -- in their rhetoric , at least , even if their actions often failed to match			0
" now @entity4 has a political base that is more divided and broad - ranging than ever before , and allies that are profoundly uneasy about its policies			0
and suddenly its neighbours are more pluralist			0
@entity20 has new democratic allies abroad , in many cases allied to the @entity25 -- @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 prominent among them			1
" @entity4 also have elections to think about even before the cease - fire was brokered , @entity0 's @entity102 observed : " where does this leave @entity4 ? simply put , while @entity4 is stronger militarily , it is in a weaker political position than it was in 2009			2
" the long universal of the @entity87 world is a dislike of the @entity4 state 's treatment of @entity112			2
in the past most @entity87 leaders were dictators , able to take a path far different from the views of the @entity87 street			0
the region 's new @entity118 democratically - elected leaders are only too aware of the radical hardliners waiting for an opportunity			0
" @entity20 : despite the deaths and destruction in @entity3 , the @entity125 political movement that rules the territory has emerged emboldened from this conflict and its truce , according to some observers			1
" @entity20 has emerged stronger , it has consolidated its control over @entity3 and it has gained now more legitimacy , " said @entity130 , a @entity56 scholar at the @entity131 , told @entity0			1
in the eyes of many @entity112 people , the militant leaders of @entity3 took on @entity4 more boldly than ever before , firing rockets farther than ever before			0
and they may yet manage to get an easing of the @entity3 economic blockade if a more comprehensive deal can be reached			0
timeline : @entity4 - @entity3 conflict " look what they accomplished ; they , rather than ( president @entity148 ) @entity147 , has put the @entity112 issue back on the international stage , " says @entity130			2
but with @entity155 once a key figure in uniting rag - tag @entity20 militias into organized brigades , counter-intuitively his death could mean more unrest ahead			0
" he was an enforcer of peace as well as war , " said @entity60 , adding that his death may " make it not only harder to reach a peace agreement , but it can make it harder to avoid war			0
" @entity163 : @entity165 president @entity147 and his @entity163 faction that governs the @entity167 have lost much in this conflict , commented @entity0 's @entity16			1
" he was supposed to be the moderate peace broker who could finally forge a new deal with @entity4			0
now he can not even claim to speak for all @entity112 and has shown that he has no leverage with @entity20 , his archrival			2
" in an op - ed for @entity0 , @entity172 , vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the @entity173 , said @entity20 was not trying to destroy the state of @entity4			1
" rather , it was to gain the upper hand in its endless and fruitless battle against @entity163 for the @entity112 political mantle , ideally with the wind of the @entity87 world 's @entity125 revolutions at its back			0
that wo n't happen either			0
" @entity97 's @entity185 and @entity98 's @entity186 are willing to lend rhetorical support and a few visits to @entity3 , but they 're never going to do anything substantial for @entity112 because they neither care enough about actual @entity112 people nor wish to queer their pitch with @entity193 and the @entity25			1
" @entity97 : president @entity185 , clearly underestimated , deftly navigated what is a minefield of competing interests , including those of his own country			1
" for a civilian president in @entity97 perceived as a weak leader , he has , much to everyone 's surprise , delivered , " said @entity130			2
@entity185 proved he had the leverage necessary to bring @entity20 to the table and get its leadership to agree to a cease - fire			1
brokering that deal has given him much needed political capital in both the @entity87 world and the @entity25			0
under former president @entity211 , the country 's security forces had suppressed its own islamists in the @entity213 , even jailing @entity185 at one point			2
that gave @entity185 and his government influence with @entity20 that @entity211 , a product of @entity97 's military establishment , never had , said @entity219 , a professor of international relations and @entity56 analyst at the @entity222			1
" @entity20 listens to @entity185 , " @entity219 told @entity0 as the talks were still going on			1
" @entity20 looks up to @entity97 now , at this particular stage , and that is why @entity97 has emerged as the most important state vis - a - vis @entity20 and @entity3			1
" @entity97 's role in the talks was " pivotal , " he said			1
@entity97 and @entity185 proved ' pivotal ' in @entity3 cease - fire talks @entity231 : the @entity233 's nuclear program was one of the unspoken aspects to the conflict , according to world affairs columnist @entity237			1
" @entity231 and its nuclear program also play a powerful psychological role , as observers and participants ponder the parallels between the latest @entity4 - @entity20 conflict and a possible war in which @entity231 would stand against the @entity25 or @entity4 , and perhaps other @entity246 allies			1
" little wonder then that @entity4 has received strong support from @entity25 president @entity260 -- who has repeatedly stated , " we are fully supportive of @entity4 's right to defend itself from missiles raining on people 's homes " -- as well as from nations including the @entity80 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , the @entity256 and others			1
" when @entity4 see a rocket launched from @entity3 , the thought that one day that rocket could carry nuclear materials burns hot in their mind			0
" but @entity231 's hand was arguably weakened after this episode as @entity4 's @entity24 shot hundreds of its missiles out the sky , @entity0 's @entity16 said			1
while @entity4 has always accused @entity231 of smuggling weapons to @entity20 through the @entity97 border , @entity231 today implicitly confirmed it			1
" @entity3 is under siege , so we can not help them			0
the @entity275 missiles have not been shipped from @entity231			0
its technology has been transferred ( there ) and are being produced quickly , " @entity276 , the head of @entity231 's @entity277 , is quoted as saying by the @entity231 news agency @entity278 .			0
