-- @entity2 officials announced an extensive restructuring of the agencies that oversee offshore oil drilling wednesday , pledging " fundamental change " for a system widely criticized after the worst oil spill in @entity10 history			1
the expected moves split the since - renamed @entity12 into separate agencies , with one responsible for approving offshore leases and another to enforce safety and environmental laws			1
@entity17 , the head of the current @entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20 , told reporters the reorganization is aimed at beefing up safety after " decades of neglect " and conflicts of interest among regulators			2
" this reorganization is much more than just moving boxes around , " @entity17 said			0
" it is about a comprehensive review and a fundamental change in the way that these agencies operate			2
" the @entity2 said it plans to have its newly created @entity18 and @entity34 up and running by october 1			0
a separate agency to collect revenues from leases was spun off from @entity12 in 2010			1
the announcement came eight days after the presidential commission that investigated last april 's sinking of the drill rig @entity42 sharply criticized regulators for their passivity , finding they were outmatched , underfunded and had conflicting responsibilities that prevented them from effective oversight of the offshore oil industry			1
the sinking killed 11 workers and uncapped an undersea gusher that spewed more than 200 million gallons of crude into the @entity54 before it was contained in june			0
efforts to reshape the @entity12 began shortly after the explosion			1
before the disaster , internal watchdog reports criticized @entity12 inspectors for accepting meals and tickets to sporting events from oil companies they monitored in the @entity54 and found regulators in the agency 's @entity67 office received improper gifts , engaged in illegal drug use and had inappropriate sexual relationships with energy industry representatives			1
the @entity2 is also setting up a committee of top scientists and engineers to recommend improvements in offshore safety and well containment procedures			2
@entity80 , the former head of @entity81 , will lead that committee , the department announced			0
" i think what has become abundantly clear through the various investigations , including the report of the @entity87 , is that industry moved deeper and deeper into our nation 's waters , " interior secretary @entity83 said			0
" and while the technology for oil and gas drilling in those waters developed very quickly , other technologies that should have come along hand - in - hand simply did not			0

the former @entity12 is being split into *permitting* and safety bureaus
the agency was widely criticized before the @entity42 disaster
a separate safety committee will review drilling and spill response plans
