-- have you been flying much this summer ? if so , how has the experience been ? right			1
flying these days -- the jammed - to - the - groaning - point cabins and torture - rack legroom ; the fees for everything from checking your bags to being handed a paltry package of food ; the endless , we 'll - x - ray - you - to - within - an - inch - of - your - dignity security lines ; the sweaty guy in the next seat with a tank top on and his shoes off -- you know how it is			1
airline asks passengers for gas money @entity22 is too often a dreary , joy - sapping slog			1
it 's difficult even to remember that it was ever any other way			2
which is why , at @entity28 in @entity29 recently , i was intrigued when someone mentioned to me a book about that very airport			1
the book had a workmanlike title : " when @entity35 landed at @entity29 's @entity28			1
" because the person who recommended it to me spoke in such glowing terms , i ordered a copy through the mail			2
written by a fellow named @entity43 , who grew up around @entity28 , it is a thin , paperbound volume that appears to be a labor of love and respect			1
it tells the story of one @entity48 , a photographer - for - hire in the first boom years of commercial air travel in the @entity51			1
@entity52 -- he died in 1994 -- was a newspaper photographer who decided he might be able to do better as his own boss			2
in the 1930s , ' 40s and ' 50s , flying was a big deal			1
when a family went on vacation by air , it was a major life event			2
@entity63 set up a company called @entity65 at @entity28 -- @entity66 was many years from being built -- to offer professional photo service to anyone passing through the airport who wanted a memento of the occasion			1
but he also began taking photos of @entity35 ( and political ) stars as they arrived in @entity29			1
the cross-country flights in those years had to stop to refuel , and @entity28 was often where they set down			1
@entity43 's book is filled with @entity63 's old photos			0
and ... well , take a look at the selection of those photos atop today 's column			0
the next time you 're frustrated and downcast about what air travel has become , the memory of the photos may serve as a tonic			1
" traveling by air in those years was n't like boarding a flying bus , the way it is today , " @entity43 told me			2
" people did n't travel in flip - flops			2
i mean , no offense , @entity98 , but i do n't want to see your toes			0
" recovered wreckage fails to solve case of missing pilot the trains were still king in those years			0
the airlines wanted to convince people that flying was safe			2
" people were afraid to fly , " @entity43 said			0
" and it was expensive			0
the airlines had to make people think it was something they should try			0
his pictures of the stars as they got off the planes made air travel seem to be glamorous , sophisticated , civilized , thrilling			1
the stars dressed up to fly -- and so did everyone else			2
few celebrities had the option of private planes in those days , so the guy passing you in the aisle on a cross-country flight just might be @entity126			1
and everyone alighted from the planes by stairways onto the runways -- there were none of the sealed bridges that today attach to the terminals			0
the photos of the stars set the tone for flying			1
@entity43 told me : " people who saw pictures in the papers of stars getting off planes thought , ' hey , if @entity144 can fly , i can fly			1
i want to be like @entity144			0
' " thus , there is @entity144 -- the @entity146 himself -- looking like the proverbial million bucks , climbing off a @entity149 flight and striding toward @entity63 's camera			2
there is @entity152 , right there with @entity48 and his @entity154			1
@entity155 , a dream incarnate			0
@entity157 , taking a photo of @entity52 , as @entity63 took a photo of him			0
@entity160 , surrounded by fans			0
@entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 -- together , all in a single frame , beneath a @entity172 plane			0
it is a lost world -- the airborne world of everyday elegance , as available to the average ticket holder as to @entity176 or to @entity177			0
@entity48 , on a daily basis , captured it all			1
it was an arrangement in which everyone won			0
the airlines , which assisted him in lining up the photos , won because the results helped convince the public to abandon the trains			0
the @entity35 studios won because they got a little bit of free publicity for their stars			2
the newspapers won because , by buying photos from @entity52 , they did n't have to send photographers to the airport themselves			0
and @entity63 won , because he got the money			0
potential @entity200 cuts would create big hassles for fliers and he also won because he got the memories			0
think of his photos the next time you 're shoehorned into a seat next to a fellow who 's dripping the sloppy innards of his carry - on submarine sandwich onto your sleeve			1
air travel was once a treasured experience , exciting , exotic , something never to be forgotten			0
you , too , could travel like @entity216			0
who , of course , knew that @entity48 would be waiting for her on the runway at the bottom of the stairs			1
that era of travel is gone now			0
and you ? your flight is boarding			2
why are n't you smiling ? are you a window flier or an aisle seater ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			1

@entity230 : @entity22 has become a soul - *sucking* slog with *cramped* seats , bad food
he says it used to be pretty glamorous ; a @entity29 photog captured this in ' 30s - ' 50s
@entity48 took pictures of celebrities , politicians arriving at @entity28
@entity230 : stars made flying *desirable* , high - toned ; think of this next time you endure a flight
