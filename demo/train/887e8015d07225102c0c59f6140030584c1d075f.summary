-- imagine an icy cold day , @entity1			1
a chilly breeze , southwest @entity3			1
@entity4 drifting slowly from low slate clouds , @entity6			0
now , keep those images close at hand			0
you 're going to need something to help keep you cool as @entity11 pours a big bucket of brutal heat on your head			2
" i 'm not worried as much about the people who have lived here a while , " said sgt. @entity15 , spokesman for the @entity17 police in that @entity1 city along the @entity3 border			1
" it 's more the tourists coming into the area , even from @entity3 , who are n't used to this kind of heat			1
" civic and emergency officials throughout the @entity30 say that if there was ever a time to worry , this would be it			2
the reason is n't just the oppressive heat that plagued the region : it 's the fact it is expected to hang around , and possibly even get worse , over the next few days			0
many of the excessive heat warnings issued by the @entity40 extend through tuesday night , with advisories from northern @entity3 , including @entity42 , all the way to southern @entity1			1
forecasters say temperatures through the weekend could rival a 2005 heat wave that killed 17 people in the @entity6 area			1
the culprit is a high pressure dome that 's blocking cooler air coming down from the @entity52 , @entity0 meteorologist @entity53 explains			0
that system wo n't begin to break up until early next week , she said			0
as a result , @entity57 residents should see a high of 118 degrees on saturday			0
that 's the temperature the @entity40 expects the thermostat will reach in @entity6 both on sunday and monday			0
it should max out at 115 in the coming days in @entity64 , @entity3			2
it 's not like sunset will provide much respite , as temperatures may not drop below 90 degrees in many places , even in the middle of the night			1
yet all those conditions are practically wintry compared to what 's expected in @entity73 , where temps could climb to 129 degrees			1
the high temps come just a couple weeks before the 100th anniversary of what the @entity40 calls the " highest reliably recorded air temperature on @entity11 " -- 134 degrees on july 10 , 1913 , in @entity73 's @entity79			1
it likely wo n't get that bad , but that does n't mean it wo n't be dangerous			0
that 's why @entity15 said authorities in @entity85 are making sure every police officer on the beat has cool water or @entity89 handy , why waters at the city 's aquatic center are being chilled , and why fire stations are offering free cold water to passers - by			0
precautions are also being taken in the case of a worst - case scenario -- a power outage that knocks out air conditioning that people need to get through the intense heat			1
but barring such a calamity , @entity15 said , " most people know , ' we 're going to stay indoors			0
' " of course , there will be those who do n't do that -- perhaps because they have to be outside , or maybe because they 're convinced they can beat the heat			2
those fighting fires -- like a blaze that ripped through a @entity57 salvage yard friday evening , torching vehicles , sending huge plumes of black smoke into the air and triggering several explosions -- do n't have much choice to stay inside			2
in @entity3 , the so - called @entity122 in @entity123 was still raging at 5:45 p.m. ( 8:45 p.m. et ) friday , having more than doubled in size to 200 acres over the course of the day , according to @entity3 's @entity126			1
in addition to firefighters , police pitched in by going door - to - door asking people to evacuate			0
but the weather was n't , and wo n't , be much help at all : forecasts for the area call for sunny skies and temperatures topping out at 109 degrees both days this weekend			2
@entity138 is one of those people in the heat - drenched zone who ventured outside , even if she did n't have to			2
still , when she went out for a run friday in 100 - plus degree heat in @entity42 , @entity138 was equipped with a water bottle in her hand and the understanding in her mind that now is not the time to push your limits			1
" listen to your body , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity150			0
" if your body says , ' i do n't feel good , i do n't feel right , ' go inside , get some shade , get some water			0

new : those fighting *wildfires* and other blazes must battle *extreme* heat as well
excessive heat warnings extend from northern @entity3 to @entity1 and beyond
it could reach 129 in @entity73 -- five degrees short of the all - time record
temperatures may not fall below 90 at night in some areas
