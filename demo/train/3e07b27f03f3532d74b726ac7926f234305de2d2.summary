-- the world 's top two players will battle it out for the @entity4 title on saturday , but their route to the @entity4 final could not have been more different			1
relief was evident on the face of defending champion and world no. 2 @entity11 who survived a third - set comeback from @entity13 to nail down a hard - fought 6 - 1 2 - 6 6 - 4 victory			1
conversely , @entity15 , the world no. 1 , was so dominant against @entity17 that the @entity18 ironically celebrated the only game she won in a match that lasted just 46 minutes and ended 6 - 0 6 - 1			1
@entity11 must now try and arrest her poor record against the @entity22 , having won just two of their 15 encounters			2
saturday 's meeting will be the first time since 1995 that the top two seeds have faced each other in the final			2
@entity11 , from @entity31 , had been coasting in the first set but her @entity34 opponent battled back to exert similar dominance over the second			1
but a delay for rain allowed @entity11 to regroup and when she returned to @entity40 the 26 - year - old fought off a late @entity13 charge to book a second successive final			1
" i really had to play to the end today and i am extremely happy to be back in the final , " @entity11 told reporters at a press conference			1
" ( the rain delay ) gave me a little bit of time to think of what i did well in the first set and try to get that back again for the third			0
" @entity13 agreed the short rain break had stalled her comeback and played into her opponent 's hands			1
" i think the break kind of changed the momentum , for sure , " she said			0
" when we got back out i kind of did n't start the same way i was playing in the second set			0
" i was just trying to make things happen too quick and started missing the ball			0
you know , it was a little bit unfortunate and inconsistent in that particular moment			0
" there were no such twists and turns in the other semifinal as @entity15 punished @entity17 , the no. 5 seed , right from the first point to reach only her second final in @entity71			1
@entity15 hit 40 winners while @entity17 could only manage two			1
the @entity18 managed to claim just five points on @entity15 ' serve			1
" i told myself : ' @entity15 , just concentrate ' and that 's what i did , " @entity15 , who beat sister @entity74 to win the @entity75 , said in an on - court interview			1
" against @entity11 , i will have to prepare slightly differently			2
she 's a great player			2
but it 's magnificent to be back in the final after 11 years			2
" @entity17 , a losing finalist to @entity11 last year , was philosophical after her sixth straight defeat to her @entity22 opponent			1
" i enjoyed it , " she told reporters			0
" it was a great court , great weather			0
what she did today was unbelievable			0
she is so strong and is an unbelievable player			0
" " it was a great day			0
i tried but that 's sport			2
sometimes you lose , but you have to stay in there and try until the last point			0
i gave it my all , but there was nothing i could do			0

@entity11 will face @entity15 in the women 's @entity4 final
@entity31 's @entity11 holds her nerve to beat @entity13 in three sets
@entity15 *destroys* @entity18 @entity17 by winning 6 - 0 6 - 1 in just 46 minutes
