for 13 - year - old @entity3 , the inspiration to impact her world began in 2009 , after her father showed her a magazine article about a shoe recycling program			1
" we decided ( that instead of ) recycling them , we would collect them and give them to people that needed them , " she says			2
and with that , shoes for the @entity15 was born and delivered 365 pairs of shoes that first year			1
in the five years since , the @entity20 teen and her father , @entity21 , have collected about 10,000 pairs of shoes for an @entity25 homeless shelter			1
but what 's especially impressive about this middle school student is she does this despite the daily struggles life brings her			2
about the time she began collecting shoes , she developed vision problems that ended up with one of her retinas detached and her vision extremely limited in the other			1
she 's now legally blind , and doctors say she will be completely without sight in the next two to five years			1
outside the comfort of her home , she oftentimes will need to use a cane			0
her family has taken several vacations to scenic destinations such as the @entity46 , wanting @entity3 to be able to experience breathtaking views while she still has a little vision left			1
but her disability has n't stopped her from becoming a young dynamo			0
besides shoes for the @entity15 , @entity3 is a competitive swimmer with dreams of making the @entity53 in @entity54			1
she wears special goggles and a special cane is used by another person so she knows when she 's approaching the wall			0
her shoe initiative has made her an inspiration for those much older as well			0
an employee off @entity3 's father , @entity63 , first came in contact with the @entity66 family after one of her daughters was in the same sunday school class as @entity3			1
she does n't mince words about her potential , saying this with a hearty laugh : " she 's going to take over the world , that kid			0
" but she still enjoys having fun and has found ways to work in some hijinks with her father on their project			0
" the second year , my dad made an agreement with me that if we collected 1,000 pairs of shoes , which he thought was completely out of the ballpark , that i could shave his head , so 1,598 shoes later , he had a shaved head ! " but deep down , it 's a very serious way to help those in crisis			1
and the residents at the @entity96 , where @entity3 donates the shoes , are extremely grateful for what she does			1
@entity99 ended up at the shelter after struggling with substance abuse			0
everything he wears was donated			2
" her example is an awesome example of being selfless , " he says			2
@entity3 enjoys the appreciation she receives from the shelter residents : " the men , a lot of them come up and give me hugs and say thank you after we 're done			2
" her childhood has been different from than most of her peers , but she refuses to let it be an excuse			0
she challenges others to go out and be of service to others			0
" if you have a dream and you think it 's unrealistic , just keep on doing it because you 'll get there			0

@entity3 , 13 , is legally blind but still collects thousands of shoes for less *fortunate* .
@entity3 thought *footwear* would be better off donated than recycled
shoes for the @entity15 began in 2009 and has collected around 10,000 pairs
her family says she is selfless and very *rarely* dwells on her handicap
