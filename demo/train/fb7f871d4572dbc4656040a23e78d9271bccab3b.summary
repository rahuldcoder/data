-- thirty - one - year old @entity1 says she knew by the time she was in high school that she never wanted to be a parent			0
" it is my decision , and the best decision for my life , " said @entity6 , a former veterinary technician from @entity7 , @entity8 , now living in @entity9 , @entity10 , with her husband			0
" i know who i am and what i want in life , and know without a doubt children do not fit into that equation , " she said			2
" i know that happiness does not have to include 2.5 children , a house in the suburbs and a white picket fence			2
" nearly one in five @entity27 women now ends her childbearing years without having a child , compared with one in ten in the 1970s , according to recently released @entity27 @entity31 data			1
the most educated women , those with bachelor 's degrees or higher , are among the most likely never to have given birth , according to the @entity36			2
women like @entity6 are challenging the idea that happy and fulfilled lives require children			1
in fact , other studies suggest that having children can have a negative impact on happiness			1
" as a group , parents of all types and all socioeconomic levels in the @entity27 report more symptoms of depression and emotional distress than their childless adult counterparts , " said @entity46 , a @entity47 sociology professor who researches the association between parenthood and emotional well - being			1
her information is based on a nationally representative study sampling 11,473 @entity27			1
they were picked from all races , socioeconomic backgrounds and educational levels			0
@entity74 psychology professor @entity73 's book " @entity71 " looked at several studies and found that children give adults many things , but an " increase in daily happiness is probably not among them			1
" he says that psychologists have found parents are less happy interacting with their kids than doing activities such as eating , watching television or even exercising			1
" it 's such a counterintuitive finding , because we have these cultural beliefs that children are the key to happiness and a healthy life , and they 're not , " said @entity80			2
" from the outside you see the detrimental effects of what our cultural beliefs cause , yet there is this group of people telling you children are the best thing that will ever happen to you , " said @entity6			2
@entity6 , an army military wife for the past year and a half , said she never felt any pressure to have any kids , and her family has been supportive of her choice			2
outside her inner circle , however , the reception has been different			0
" the typical reaction i get is of dismay and pity , " she noted			0
but @entity6 , an only child , is far from feeling dismal and finds it ironic that people in her life with children often complain about their lifestyles			1
" i always find it interesting how parents complain about their kids , yet follow it with a statement pertaining to how fulfilling their life is , " she said			1
" i have yet to meet a parent that does not have an almost daily story of how their child has stressed them in some way			2
" @entity80 says there are other challenges for parents , too			0
the sociology professor said marital satisfaction decreases after the birth of the first child and continually decreases over time			0
employment retention and earnings suffer for women in the @entity27 when they have kids , too , according to research , cited by @entity141 , a professor at the @entity142			1
" research shows women in our country often lose out financially and in career advancement once they become a parent -- because the @entity27 does not have the type of work policies to properly support families and child care , like other developed nations , " said @entity143			1
raising a child is expensive , too			0
according to @entity27 government figures , the average cost to raise a child from birth to age 17 is about $ 222,360 for a child born in 2009 ( in 2009 dollars )			1
that includes food , housing , transportation , clothing , health care , education , childcare , and other miscellaneous expenses			0
so what do current parents think of this research ? it depends on whom you ask , says @entity80			0
" i 've received hate mail in the past from some parents after they 've read about the studies , but often find that many parents feel liberated by the research , " she said			1
" parenting is a very difficult , stressful job , and many people who read the data discover they are not the only ones who feel overwhelmed by the tough work			0
" despite these findings , @entity80 , who is the mother of two grown children , does n't say @entity27 should stop having kids and does not have an agenda to stop procreation			1
" the take - away from the research ( is ) that if you are a parent or want to become a parent , understand what you are getting yourself into and be prepared for a lot of hard work , sweat and tears -- even under the best of conditions , " she said			0
both @entity80 and @entity143 say parents in the @entity27 often lack the proper support , child care and assistance to raise a child			1
they say they 'd like to see the government implement and subsidize more " kid - friendly " policies to help families thrive			0
@entity80 and @entity143 are working on a project to compare the " emotional well - being " of @entity27 parents versus parents from 21 other developed countries			1
they expect parents from countries with greater support systems than the @entity27 to fare better , but do n't want to make that assumption until their research is complete			1
studies abound on this topic , and a recent one might provide some cheer to parents			0
@entity233 published in the march issue of the journal @entity236 found the more children that parents over age 40 have , the happier they are			2
they used data from 86 countries for their research			0
the authors of this study say as children mature , they require less care and stress for parents -- and can become a source of support for moms and dads			2
in the meantime , @entity6 says her marriage to her best friend and " the man of my dreams " is the only family she needs to create in her lifetime			0
she trusts her gut and her decision			0
she encourages others to make their own choices , and to respect hers , too .			0
