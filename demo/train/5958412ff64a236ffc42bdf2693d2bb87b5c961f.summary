@entity1 , @entity0 -- on an island off the coast of the @entity9 city of @entity10 , architects , engineers and contractors are preparing to build a new city later this year			1
in itself , this is nothing special one would think			0
@entity14 , the eco-city being built off the coast of @entity10 on the @entity17			1
with 20 percent of the world population living in @entity9 and national population figures set to hit 1.47 billion by 2020 , there is always demand for new housing			1
but the city that is to be built on @entity23 at the mouth of the @entity17 is like no other in the world : @entity14 eco-city is planned to be first truly environmentally and economically sustainable city			1
situated on a plot of land that is around two - thirds the size of @entity32 , @entity14 is surrounded by wetlands and lies beside a bird sanctuary where hundreds of rare migratory birds seek refuge			1
it was these unusual natural conditions that sparked the ambitious idea of creating a new urban concept for an entirely sustainable city that would minimally impact the surrounding environment			1
@entity43 started in 2005 , after the @entity1 - based engineering and design firm @entity44 signed a contract with the @entity47 ( @entity47 )			0
" we were asked to create an ' eco-demonstrator ' , " explains @entity48 , @entity44 's project coordinator for the @entity14 project since 2004 , " a project that incorporated a number of ideas and design concepts that would increase the @entity9 understanding of sustainability			1
" @entity9 has known about sustainability for 20 years , but -- like everyone else -- it has just not been able to apply it as a concept			1
" the project is to be implemented in several phases , starting with a one square - kilometer plot that is expected to be ready in time for @entity10 's @entity65 and that will house around 5,000 people			0
the 6.5 square kilometer start - up area will be developed to accommodate 80,000 people by 2020 and by 2050 , the city is projected to cover an area of 30 square kilometers and have a population of half a million			2
building a community spirit today the site is still isolated from the mainland , but the opening of a bridge and tunnel link in 2008 will reduce travel times to and from the island from over three hours to just one hour			1
@entity14 is however not to be just another dormitory town from which people commute to @entity10 : the new city will provide jobs to its inhabitants			1
" it is what we call integrated urbanism : we look not just at the environment , but also at social and economic aspects : employment opportunities , the way people work , the way people play , the way they move around the city , " says @entity48			2
at the same time , the project also deals with technical aspects like how to provide a sustainable water supply , how to treat wastewater , how to recycle and process waste and how to reduce the use of cars , by concentrating activities around three " village entrees " and encouraging people to walk , use bikes or public transport			0
" the important thing is that we are not restricting people ; we are trying to encourage them to think about the way they live			0
questions like : how much electricity do you use and what type of electricity ? " says @entity48 , adding that cars in @entity14 will run on hydro - fuel or electricity , thus reducing noise and improving air quality			1
but what will daily life in @entity14 be like ? @entity48 describes a typical day , in which people can walk their children to school , head on to work , easily meet their partners and friends for lunch and enjoy the many green spaces			2
at the same time people will also be more aware of their impact on the environment			0
they will get electricity from wind turbines and they will be able to monitor their energy and water use in the home			0
" the project is very much about creating a community , " says @entity48			0
" @entity146 is very important and it is something the @entity9 are very good at now , but which may disappear with the current explosive growth of cities			2
" visionary concept despite all the new technologies and sustainable concepts , @entity14 will remain a recognizably @entity9 city			1
after studying the site and its history and looking at the elements that make up the traditional @entity9 city , designers came up with ways to give @entity14 a @entity9 feel			1
" there are lots of water spaces and bridges with what the @entity9 call ' dreamy pools '			2
it is a city that is close to nature and that helps people understand nature , " says @entity48			0
using ideas from @entity14 , @entity44 is today working on the development of master plans for three other eco-cities in @entity9 and also master plans for cities in @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179			1
" the key of the @entity14 concept is that all elements are considered			2
and in principle this can be applied anywhere else in the world			0
but it does take a visionary to make the project viable ; a project like that is not just business as usual			0
" it is more complex , because the economic viability is just as important as sustainability			0
a city ca n't be sustainable if it is not economically viable , " says @entity48			2
thus , starting on a modest one - square kilometer plot at the mouth of @entity17 , a group of visionaries is perhaps revolutionizing the way we will live in and think about cities around the world			0

@entity9 island is first truly environmentally sustainable city
@entity14 is being planned with a community spirit in mind
