-- the @entity2 sack race has been as busy as ever this season , but @entity5 manager @entity4 has signaled his long - term commitment to the club in an industry that has been criticized for its short term outlook			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 have all been given the push by top - flight clubs in @entity16 this term -- @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 respectively -- while @entity22 resigned before @entity23 had the chance to do the same			2
and with @entity30 's future at @entity31 seemingly ever more uncertain , the days of a manager enjoying 27 years at the helm of a club as sir @entity28 recently did with @entity32 seem consigned to the past			0
@entity4 first arrived at @entity34 in 2004 and went on to guide @entity5 to the @entity2 title -- the club 's first for 50 years -- as well as the @entity37 , the @entity38 , two @entity39 and a further league title			1
but despite writing his name into @entity5 's history books , a well - publicised fall - out with the club 's owner , @entity43 , ultimately led to his exit in 2007			1
this time , however , @entity4 , who returned to west @entity46 in the summer , is hoping to stay around long enough to create a real legacy			1
" realistically i have a four - year contract and i hope at the end of the four years we sit down , analyze the situation and we are both happy for me either to carry on or happy to separate , " @entity4 told reporters ahead of @entity5 's visit to @entity50 on monday			1
" my desire and my feeling is to work for these four years and after that analyze the situation			0
" after departing from @entity5 in 2007 , @entity4 went on to manage @entity59 where more success followed , including the @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 in 2010			1
@entity64 was the @entity66 's next destination , where he added the @entity68 title , the @entity69 and the @entity70 to his coaching cv			2
despite the relative success , @entity4 left @entity74 's capital under a cloud at the end of last season -- reportedly falling out with the club 's players and its president , @entity80			2
the @entity5 boss , however , disputes this theory , saying : " i 've had teams where i needed to be successful immediately			2
i had @entity64 , and i left there because i wanted to , not because the club wanted me to			0
" there were clubs in other countries where it would have been easy for me to go to and find an easy job			0
" having had opportunities to take up an " easy job " elsewhere , the former @entity91 boss feels his latest post is far more challenging			0
with the likes of @entity96 and @entity97 , who were in their prime during @entity4 's first spell in charge at @entity5 , growing ever older , the @entity66 has been handed the task of forging a new side based around the talents of younger players like @entity106 and @entity107			1
and it was this project , along with his admiration for the @entity16 game , that persuaded @entity4 to return to @entity5			1
" i 'm here because i love this club and i love the pressure			0
it 's a different project for me and that 's why i 'm here , " he said			0
" i also love this country in terms of football , no doubt about that , but the main reason was the club explained what they want from me and i was open to that			0

@entity4 hints is keen to stay at @entity5 beyond his *current* contract
the @entity66 enjoyed a successful three - year stint at @entity5 from 2004 - 2007
then he fell out with club owner @entity43 , but returned in the summer
