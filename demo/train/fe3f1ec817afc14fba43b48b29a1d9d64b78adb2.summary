@entity0 -- the @entity4 company trying to contain the release of radiation from its @entity8 nuclear plant must pour enough water to cool its damaged reactors without creating an overflow of contaminated water from the plant , a government official said tuesday			1
@entity14 , @entity4 's chief cabinet secretary and the government 's point man for the nation 's nuclear crisis , said the effort to prevent the reactors from overheating " must be given priority			1
" but @entity14 acknowledge the danger posed by continuing to pour water into them			2
" if we need to increase water injection , this is what we need to do			0
if we stop water injection , fuel rod temperatures may increase and that may result in overheating , " @entity14 said			0
" but fundamentally we need to drain the water as soon as possible			0
" @entity14 's remarks came a day after he told reporters that the containment structure surrounding one of the reactors at a quake - battered nuclear power plant is damaged and may be leaking radioactive material			1
the plant 's owner disclosed that small amounts of plutonium had been found among contaminants around the facility late monday as @entity4 authorities struggled to explain how radioactive water was leaking into maintenance tunnels and possibly , into the @entity51			1
@entity14 told reporters monday afternoon that " there may be a leak " from the containment vessel surrounding the no. 2 reactor			1
he said experts were still trying to determine the condition of the reactor 's pressure vessel , which sits inside the containment vessel and immediately surrounds the radioactive fuel rods at the reactor 's core			1
" somehow , we understand water is being moved from one place to another , " @entity14 said			0
" we need to hear an explanation from experts			0
" reactors 1 to 3 at the plant , located about 240 kilometers ( 140 miles ) north of @entity0 , are believed to have suffered core damage after their cooling systems were knocked out by the march 11 earthquake and tsunami that ravaged northern @entity4			1
the tsunami knocked out backup generators that ran their coolant systems and damaged water pumps at the plant , forcing workers to scramble to prevent a meltdown			2
technicians restored external electric power late monday to the no. 3 reactor plant , a step toward restoring cooling systems there , the plant 's owner reported late monday			1
but hydrogen explosions -- an early symptom of core damage -- inflicted heavy damage on the buildings housing the no. 1 and no. 3 reactors in the days following the quake , and another suspected explosion rocked the no. 2 reactor on march 15			1
@entity4 nuclear regulators and the owner , the @entity102 , say they know little about what damage was sustained in that blast			2
@entity102 announced late monday that plutonium -- a reactor byproduct that is also part of the fuel mix in the no. 3 reactor -- had turned up in soil on the plant grounds in tests taken last week			1
however , the company said it was equivalent to the amounts that fell on @entity4 following above - ground nuclear weapons tests by other countries in past decades , and posed no health risk to humans			2
" just in case , @entity102 will increase the monitoring of the nuclear plant grounds and the surrounding environment , " the company said			1
three plutonium isotopes -- @entity124 , -239 and -240 -- were found in soil at five different points inside the plant grounds , @entity102 reported			1
the element can be a serious health hazard if inhaled or ingested , but external exposure poses little health risk , according to the @entity133 @entity132			0
the company said the discovery would not change efforts to bring an end to the crisis at the plant , which has spread radioactive contamination across much of northern @entity4			1
water found in a maintenance tunnel leading to unit @entity146 's turbine house remained radioactive enough to pose an immediate hazard , authorities reported after taking new readings monday afternoon			1
the 1,000 millisievert per hour reading is more than 330 times the dose an average person in a developed country receives per year and can result in vomiting and up to a 30 percent higher risk of cancer , according to the @entity156			0
the level is also four times the top dose @entity4 's @entity159 has set for emergency workers struggling to control the further emission of radioactive material from the damaged plant			1
@entity164 , an expert on radiation and public health at the @entity167 , told @entity1 's " @entity172 " that the level suggests operators are facing " a deteriorating situation " at the no. 2 reactor			2
" fortunately , that 's in the reactor area , not outside and not in @entity0 or even in the area in @entity8 province , " @entity164 said			0
" but in the reactor area itself , that 's -- that 's concerning to me			0
we 're starting to see levels now that are dangerous to reactor workers if they 're in those contaminated areas			2
" the officials said it was unclear how contaminated water got into the tunnel , or if it might have spilled out and seeped into the @entity51 from there			1
" right now , it is not known , " @entity191 , an official with @entity4 's @entity192 , said monday evening			1
water was being pumped out of the no. 1 and no. 2 turbine building , but @entity191 noted that there is no place to put water pooled in the no. 2 building 's basement			2
the plan is to extract the water using what he called a condenser			0
but that apparatus is " almost full , " as are several storage tanks nearby			0
a similar challenge is holding up the removal of collected water in the no. 3 unit 's turbine building basement			1
" so we will first have to empty some of the tanks , " he said , adding later only that the tainted water needs to be removed " as soon as possible			0
" seawater readings from a monitoring post 330 meters ( 361 yards ) into the @entity51 showed elevated readings of the reactor byproduct @entity221 , an isotope that loses half its radioactivity every eight days			0
the measurement was taken north of the discharge canal for reactors 1 - 4 , where a reading of 1,850 times normal was recorded sunday			0
and despite reduced alarms in recent days , @entity191 noted monday that the temperature is rising inside the no. 1 reactor -- a sign that the nuclear fuel rods in that unit remain in danger of overheating			2
units 1 , 2 and 3 were the only three of the six reactors operating when the magnitude 9 earthquake struck			0
the quake and resulting tsunami knocked out backup generators that ran their coolant systems and damaged water pumps at the plant , leaving authorities scrambling to pump water into the reactors and the spent fuel pools to prevent a meltdown			2
authorities have switched from pumping seawater into the reactors to using fresh water , and plan to switch from seawater to fresh water in the spent fuel pools , where old fuel rods are stored			0
monday was the 32nd anniversary of the worst @entity133 nuclear accident , a partial meltdown at the @entity265 power plant outside @entity266 , @entity267			0
though no deaths or injuries resulted , the accident hamstrung the @entity133 atomic power industry for decades			0
@entity1 's @entity272 contributed to this report			0
