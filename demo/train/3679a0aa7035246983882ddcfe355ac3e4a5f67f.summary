@entity0 and the @entity2 battle flag			1
it 's not about race relations or a relic 's true meaning			2
it 's not about whether a group can co-opt a pejorative of which they 've historically been the butt and make it their own , much like the gay community did with " queer " or african - americans did with the n - word			0
no , the conversation is about @entity0 and that flag			1
the rapper thrust himself into the spotlight , yet again , with news that several pieces of merchandise from his @entity25 tour are emblazoned with the controversial @entity26			0
at his tour store in @entity28 , a replica of the flag is affixed to the wall with red tape and adorned with the words , " i ai n't coming down			2
" @entity35 exploded after word got out , and while @entity0 saw some support , including a fellow who called him a " pro-black genius , " others called him a disgrace			2
read one tweet , " @entity41 ! brother i marched to have that vile rag torn down from the state house grounds			0
" asked to explain the rationale for including the controversial symbol on his clothing , @entity0 told @entity48 , " the @entity2 flag represented slavery in a way			1
that 's my abstract take on what i know about it , right ? so i wrote the song , ' @entity57			0
' so i took the @entity2 flag and made it my flag			1
it 's my flag now			2
now what you gon na do ? " he added later in the interview , " it 's colorless also			0
it 's super- ' hood and super-white - boy - approved at the same time			0
" those are n't the words of someone seeking to further dialogue , said hip - hop historian and @entity74 adjunct professor @entity73			1
it sounds more like a man courting controversy , especially when you consider the source			0
" @entity0 does n't move by accident			1
there 's definitely a level of publicity involved in this , " @entity73 said , adding that while @entity0 " built his career around controversy , " no one should begrudge him selling anything that people are buying			1
green - lighting racism ? there are dangers , though , and @entity73 worries that @entity0 has missed an opportunity to educate people on the flag 's symbolism			1
there 's also the chance he could embolden those who fly the flag with ill will toward blacks			2
" @entity0 runs the risk of green - lighting something that is overtly racist , and i do n't think he has any plan in mind on how to educate people , " @entity73 said			1
" the opportunity to educate people on the symbolism of that flag and the racism attached to it is there			2
" not everyone is holding @entity0 to such a standard			2
" he is an entertainer , for @entity117 's sake			0
of course , it 's part of a publicity thing , " said @entity121 law professor @entity120 , adding that that does n't preclude it from being useful , interesting or justifiable			1
@entity120 , whose half dozen books on race include " nigger : the @entity135 of a @entity136 , " said there are parallels between groups co-opting epithets and @entity133 co-opting the flag , " but listen , n --- - r is still a term of abuse used to terrify people and hurt people			1
" there are both positive and negative potential upshots to @entity0 's campaign , @entity120 said			1
if it lessens someone 's anxiety about seeing the flag or diminishes the symbol 's " power to intimidate , " it 's a win , but if people forget what the flag stood for or become too ignorant about its meaning to counter claims that it 's merely a symbol of state 's rights , there could be detriment			2
" here were people who were willing to fight and die in order to enslave people , and that should n't be forgotten , " @entity120 said			0
@entity73 said that if @entity0 wanted to meaningfully take on a hot - button social issue , there are more effective ways of doing it			2
he pointed to numerous examples in hip - hop : @entity170 has been outspoken on @entity172 's stop - and - frisk policy and @entity173 's " stand your ground " law ; @entity177 and @entity178 visited @entity179 in protest of the state 's immigration law ; and several rappers have penned thoughtful lyrics admonishing the prison - industrial complex			0
" it 'd be nice if @entity0 was doing town halls while he was on tour , " @entity73 said			2
" he 's in a position to do that			0
i 'm not sure if he really realizes it or wanted to go in that direction			0
" not a trailblazer whatever @entity133 's true intention , it 's worth noting , as @entity120 pointed out , that @entity0 is n't the first person to do this			1
about a decade ago , a @entity200 , @entity199 , clothing company called @entity201 featured designs with the @entity26 in red , black and green , the colors of the @entity205 flag			0
several rappers have also used the flag , including @entity208 , @entity209 , pastor @entity210 , @entity212 and @entity213 , though @entity73 is quick to point out , " they 're not selling a flag			1
they were wearing it , so there 's a difference			0
" pastor @entity210 wonders if @entity0 , who was born in @entity219 but grew up in @entity220 and is about to move into a @entity222 mansion with fiance @entity223 , understands how powerful the symbol is in the @entity225			1
driving through @entity228 during a phone interview , the @entity219 rapper , whose real name is @entity210 , said he had just been passed by a swamp boat , the entire hull of which bore the @entity2 flag , and he would remind @entity133 to be careful disrespecting things that others find sacred			1
" now , these are the ones @entity0 needs to be worried about			2
@entity0 ai n't waving that flag in front of them , " he said			1
" be careful , @entity0			2
" not that @entity210 has n't used the flag on album covers and in videos , but " i was n't lifting it up to glorify it , " he said , explaining he knew the ramifications of using the banner			1
to @entity210 , the flag stood for rebellion , and he was being rebellious himself in flaunting it			2
" i was letting them know it was a new day down here in the @entity225 , from then to now			0
whoever would 've thought a black man could touch that flag without getting killed ? " he said			0
with @entity0 , @entity210 said , " it sounds more like a personal agenda , which you 're free to have			1
but make it make sense , as my dad used to say			0
" a complicated symbol the rev. @entity262 shared what he felt the flag represented in a column last month : " the @entity2 flag symbolizes dehumanization , injustice and pain			1
it is a stark reminder of an era in our history that was defined by the abhorrent practice of slavery			0
and it is representative of a mentality that looked upon blacks as inferiors who needed to remain in the shackles of subservience			0
" yet that meaning is far from universal			0
in addition to the aforementioned state 's rights advocates , there are those who see it only as a symbol of @entity225 pride or heritage			0
southern governors have risked boycott and ouster from office to keep it flying at state installations			0
meanwhile , president @entity299 has said it belongs in a museum			0
" when people say that the @entity2 flag represents slavery , i ask them , ' if you look at the importation of slaves to the @entity309 from @entity310 , what flag did they fly under ? it was the @entity309 flag , " said @entity312 's @entity311 , an economics professor who studies and writes about race			1
" people say , ' let 's get rid of the @entity2 flag because it 's a symbol of slavery			1
' i say , ' what do we do with the @entity309 flag ? ' " he said			0
@entity322 does n't like hip - hop music , but that does n't mean it should be banned or removed from public view , just like the @entity326 should n't be outlawed because some people have visceral reactions to the @entity329 , he said			0
while the @entity331 represented a " despicable " regime , it 's a " gross violation " of freedom of expression to ban anyone from displaying the @entity337 flag , @entity311 said			1
to @entity311 , it 's a matter of freedom of expression , the true test of which is not how one reacts when people " express themselves in ways you think they ought to express themselves , but when they express themselves in ways you find offensive			2
" while @entity73 is n't wholly ruling out that @entity133 has a plan to stoke dialogue about the flag , he has n't seen it yet			1
if the " @entity355 " rapper is just engaging in naked profiteering , that 's fine , but @entity73 said he hopes the flag 's true meaning and symbolism is n't lost or skewed in the flap			1
" you ca n't leave room for misinterpretation , or some people will take that to the bank , " @entity73 said			1
" he 's going to take some of this to the bank himself			0
" follow @entity369 on @entity35 : @ @entity370			0

@entity0 tells radio station that @entity2 flag represents slavery , so " it 's my flag now "
*experts* say it 's at least part publicity stunt , but there is potential for meaningful dialogue
rapper pastor @entity210 wonders if @entity133 grasps flag 's symbolism , warns him , " be careful , @entity0 "
professor : it 's about freedom of expression ; we ca n't ban symbols we *dislike*
