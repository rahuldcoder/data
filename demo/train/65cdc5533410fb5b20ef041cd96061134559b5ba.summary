-- to the casual observer , @entity1 does n't look like a man that feels pressure			1
he is the driving force behind one of the world 's biggest football clubs , @entity8 , and reached 100 goals for @entity8 faster than any other player in the @entity14 champion 's 111 - year history			1
but the @entity16 star admits that , behind the bravado and on - field posturing , he and his teammates are feeling the strain of the expectation that surrounds the @entity8 club			1
@entity8 's stuttering start to the season leaves them 18 points adrift of @entity27 leaders and archrivals @entity29 , with the club 's fans now demanding coach @entity32 lead @entity8 to a record 10th triumph in @entity35 's premier club competition by way of compensation			1
@entity8 must overcome @entity38 in their last 16 clash if they are to win the @entity40 for the first time in 11 years -- a tie which will see @entity1 return to the club where he announced himself as a world - class talent before leaving for @entity8 in 2009 in a deal worth $ 129 million			1
" i 've been here for three - and - a - half years now , " the 27 - year - old told @entity49 's official website			2
" everyone involved is totally focused on winning the club 's 10th @entity40			1
that creates a certain amount of anxiety , which can be felt at all times			0
" the pressure is too great and that sometimes can affect us			0
but we have to try and rise above it and not let what people say get to us , particularly the media , as @entity8 get spoken about every day			2
" @entity64 wants that 1oth @entity40 -- we 're more than aware of that			2
last season we fell just short , which was very frustrating			0
" fortunately we 've got the opportunity to set the record straight this year , though the fact we face @entity38 next makes it more difficult			1
it 's not going to be easy and i reckon the odds are about 50 - 50 , but i 'm still very confident			2
" however , the worry for @entity14 champions real is that their team has been relatively inconsistent this season			0
while @entity29 have notched up a record 18 wins from the same amount of games during the current campaign , @entity32 's team have lost four and drawn four of their first 19 matches			2
the crowd at the 85,000 - seater @entity87 stadium have targeted their frustrations at @entity32 -- a @entity40 winner with both @entity90 and @entity91 -- and @entity1			1
" we have n't started the championship very well for sure , " @entity1 continued			2
" we know that @entity27 's an uphill struggle for us now , but nothing 's impossible in football			0
we 're going to work hard , win games and see what happens			0
he added : " i 'm able to respect those who criticize me , because i know they 've got the wrong idea about me			0
people who know me and those who 've played alongside me know what kind of a guy i am			0
those who do n't know me can say and think whatever they want			0
" @entity1 's return to @entity38 , who are currently leading the @entity111 table , has led many to reflect on the six successful years he spent in @entity113 , winning the @entity40 and being named @entity114 in 2008			1
@entity38 manager @entity115 admitted recently he would like to see @entity1 return to @entity117 , but the @entity119 - born striker has moved to quell talk of an imminent move by saying he wishes to see out the remainder of his contract at @entity8 , which expires in 2015			1
" i want to see out my contract at @entity8 ; i 'm very clear about that , " he said			1
" after that , well , i do n't know what 'll happen in the future			0
" and head of february 's contest between @entity8 and @entity38 , @entity1 is confidence his current club can overcome his former employers			1
" no team 's unbeatable , but when we 're at our best we 're a really good side			0
@entity38 have started the @entity138 championship race very well and are a long way ahead of the rest			2
" but still , if we play the way we 're capable of , we can beat them			0
to do that we need to pull together and play as a team , like we 've done in so many matches before			0

@entity1 says @entity8 are under pressure to win the @entity40
real have won @entity35 's premier club competition a record nine times , but only once in last decade
@entity1 confident @entity8 can defeat former club @entity38 in the round of 16
@entity16 *international* says he will see out the remainder of his contract with @entity8
