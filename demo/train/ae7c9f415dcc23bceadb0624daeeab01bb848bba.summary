-- for most of us , it 's hard to relate to the images of destruction we see on the television screen			2
it 's nearly impossible to imaging losing it all			2
but for the residents of @entity10 , it 's all too familiar			1
monday 's massive @entity12 tornado that tore through 17 miles of @entity13 , @entity14 , brought back dark memories for those who survived the similarly powerful twister in @entity10 almost two years earlier			1
seeing footage of @entity13 , @entity14 , takes @entity19 right back to may 22 , 2011 , the day an @entity12 tornado ravaged @entity10 and killed more than 150 people			1
" i can still feel the shock , the awe , the sadness , " she said			2
" i can still remember the smell too			2
it smelled like freshly cut wood			0
" @entity28 followed up with @entity19 and other @entity10 tornado survivors to find out how they moved on after the tragedy			1
they offered the following advice to the people of @entity13 : ' let others help you ' processing emotions has been difficult since @entity19 lost her entire home in the tornado			1
two years later , the 32 - year - old continues to work with a therapist			1
talking out her struggles has helped her " move forward and not stay stuck in the past , " she said			0
" there are some days it is still hard to comprehend what i went through			0
" shock and adrenaline carried her through the first days after the tornado			1
but after that , she said she did n't know what to do			0
@entity19 empathizes with what the people of @entity13 are going through this week , remembering her own difficult experience			1
" right now it feels impossible to start picking up the pieces , not knowing where to even start , " she recalled			0
leaning on friends and family in the area helped as she started to piece her life back together			0
her advice to @entity13 residents is simple : " let others help you , even when you think you do n't need the help			1
" ' with patience we always get it right ' @entity69 hails from a @entity71 family and spent most of his life moving around			0
but when his grandparents retired , @entity10 became home			1
the day of the tornado , @entity69 , his parents , grandparents and niece were all home together			1
everyone survived , but the tornado tore their lives apart			2
his mother was drained " emotionally " from the experience , so she and his father uprooted and moved to @entity86			0
the rest of the family stayed in @entity10			1
" i could never leave this town , and i have tried , " said the 25 - year - old			0
" i just keep coming back			0
" it was @entity69 's close - knit family and his friends that helped him get through the months of wrangling with insurance companies and repairing the damage to the house			0
" i think that when you experience something so traumatic and difficult to understand , you become stronger willed and it hardens your emotions a bit , making you a bit braver , " he said			0
moving on though requires living on , @entity69 said			0
" life sucks sometimes , and we are sometimes given the worst hands when playing , but with patience , we always get it right and we always win			0
" ' it helps prevent panic ' @entity110 may have returned to his day - to - day life quickly after repairing the $ 2,000 worth of damage to his @entity10 home , but the storm affected him psychologically			1
he and his roommate called their mothers as the twister barreled through their neighborhood			0
" the calls lost connection , and when the tornado was next to us it sounded like a clothes dryer , with footballs being kicked at my house every couple of seconds , " he recalled			2
these days , the 32 - year - old lifelong @entity10 resident is a lot more wary about inclement weather			1
" twice in the last month during tornado sirens i have sped to the temporary @entity133 shelters in another town , " he said , even though he knows that he should hunker down in the nearest available shelter , as @entity133 recommends			2
@entity110 , who survived by hiding in his bathtub , has found it comforting to make his way to a shelter even when the weather is less dangerous than a tornado			2
" it helps prevent panic , " he explained			0
he encouraged tornado survivors to take advantage of free counseling and therapy that may be provided in @entity13 .			1
