a jury on saturday night convicted a @entity2 man on four charges related to his shooting into an suv full of teenagers during an argument over loud music , but could not decide on the most serious charge -- murder			1
@entity11 was found guilty on four charges , including three for attempted second - degree murder , which could land him behind bars for decades			1
yet there was no verdict on the first - degree murder charge tied to the death of 17 - year - old @entity20			1
as the jury 's decisions became clear about 7 p.m. saturday , @entity11 looked ahead solemnly with a frown but no tears			1
his lawyer , @entity25 , told reporters later that his client was " in disbelief			2
" " even as he sat next to me , he asked , how is this happening , " @entity25 said			0
" ... it has not set in			0
i do n't think it will set in anytime soon			0
" the incomplete finale to this emotional , hot - button trial -- partly because of the fact @entity11 is white and the teenagers who were shot at , including @entity20 , are black -- echoed @entity37 's trial for the killing of 17 - year - old @entity39 about 120 miles down the road in @entity41 , @entity2			1
while stand your ground was n't used by @entity11 , his lawyers did argue that he fired in self - defense			1
given the partially hung jury , state attorney @entity46 said prosecutors would press for a new trial in @entity50 on the murder charge			1
" justice for @entity20 is as important as it is for any victim , " said @entity52 , whose office also handled the @entity37 case			1
even without a final decision on the murder count -- and pending defense appeals -- the 47 - year - old @entity11 is looking at a lengthy prison term			1
prosecutor @entity62 explained saturday night that each attempted second - degree murder conviction carries a minimum sentence of at least 20 years			1
there 's also a 15 - year sentence possible on the conviction for shooting in the teenager 's vehicle			1
" you are looking at basically at life in prison , " @entity25 said , even as he vowed to challenge the convictions			1
" at 47 years old , that 's a life sentence regardless of count one			2
" the decision to convict on these counts , and not on murder , did n't come easily for a jury that had deliberated for about 30 hours since getting the case late wednesday			2
judge @entity82 acknowledged earlier saturday that the jury of four white women , two black women , four white men , an @entity87 woman and a @entity89 man was " struggling , obviously			0
" " but it 's not for want of trying to reconcile all of this , " he said then			2
" i think we 've got some analytical people in there who are trying to do just that -- trying to analyze this from every possible angle			0
" the lack of a murder conviction upset some , including protesters who marched outside the @entity103 courthouse calling for @entity52 to lose her job			2
" the people united will never be defeated , " they also chanted			0
yet @entity20 ' mother , @entity107 , did n't express any anger when she addressed reporters saturday night			2
her family , she said , is " so very happy to have just a little bit of closure			0
" " it 's sad for mr. @entity11 that he will live the rest of his life in that sense of torment , and i will pray for him , " @entity107 said			1
" and i 've asked my family to pray for him			0
" confrontation at a gas station it was november 23 , 2012 , when @entity11 pulled into a gas station in @entity103 , parking next to a red @entity122 full of teenagers			2
the teens had pulled in for gum and cigarettes ; @entity11 , meanwhile , had just left his son 's wedding with his fiancee , who 'd gone inside the convenience store for wine and chips			1
@entity11 did n't like the loud music -- " rap crap , " as he called it -- coming from the teens ' suv			2
so he asked them to turn it down			0
what followed next depends on whom you believe			0
@entity11 claimed @entity20 threatened him , and he decided to take matter into his own hands upon seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the @entity122			1
but prosecutors asserted that it was @entity11 who lost control , firing three volleys of shots -- 10 bullets total -- at the suv over music he did n't like			1
prosecutors challenged what he did next : he left the gas station and drove 40 miles away to a bed and breakfast in @entity160			0
there , @entity11 walked his dog , ordered a pizza , then drank rum and cola -- " stunned and horrified , ( shocked how ) things escalated the way they did over a common courtesy			2
" after learning almost six hours later that he had killed @entity20 , @entity11 testified that he became " crazy with grief , " experiencing stomach problems for about four hours before taking a nap			1
" my intent was to stop the attack , not necessarily end a life , " he testified			0
" it just worked out that way			0
" yet his fiancee , @entity20 , testified that @entity11 had never mentioned any weapon to her -- be it a shotgun , a stick , a barrel or a lead pipe -- unlike what @entity11 had said			1
in fact , police found a basketball , basketball shoes , clothing , a camera tripod and cups inside the teenagers ' @entity122 , but no gun			0
and @entity11 himself never called police			2
the first contacts he had with them were at his home in @entity197 -- 130 miles south of @entity160 -- as he was being apprehended			0
arguing that he was n't in a rational state of mind , @entity11 admitted , " it makes sense that i should have ( contacted authorities )			2
i ca n't tell you why			0
" echoes of @entity39 and @entity37 some were quick to compare @entity11 to @entity37 , who ultimately was acquitted of murder for the shooting of @entity39			1
@entity39 's own parents were among them , claiming @entity20 ' killing is another reminder that , in @entity2 , " racial profiling and stereotypes " may serve as the basis for illegitimate fear " and the shooting and killing of young teenagers			1
" but @entity11 's defense attorney , @entity25 , told @entity221 's @entity220 on friday that the @entity37 and @entity11 cases are n't so similar			1
there was a physical confrontation between @entity37 and @entity39 , and police gave @entity37 the benefit of the doubt about defending himself , @entity25 said			0
" my client did not wait to become that victim , " he said			0
" my client did not wait to either get assaulted by a weapon or have someone potentially pull a trigger , " he said			0
though a weapon was never found , @entity25 maintains the youths could have had one and somehow ditched in and around the gas station			0
regardless , the key point was that @entity11 believed they were armed and that his life was in danger			1
" now , does it sound irrational ? of course it sounds irrational			0
but have you ever been in that situation ? " the lawyer asked			0
after saturday 's night decision , it seems unlikely -- unless he wins on appeal -- that @entity11 will ever be in that or many other situations again			1
instead , spending the rest of his life in prison seems a more likely outcome			2
@entity25 said on saturday the four convictions leave him with regret , even as he said he could n't immediately think of anything he 'd do differently in the case			0
at the same time , the prosecution did n't manage a conviction on what was by far the biggest charge : first - degree murder			1
this mixed bag means that no one can fully celebrate the jury 's decision			0
" everybody lost something in this , " the lawyer said			0
his client " will live to fight another day " in court , but he and his loved ones are suffering now			0
@entity25 acknowledged , too , the pain felt by @entity20 ' family			2
especially on sunday , which would have been @entity20 ' 19th birthday .			1

" you are looking at basically at life in prison , " @entity11 's lawyer says
@entity11 is convicted on three counts of attempted second - degree murder
but there 's a *mistrial* on first - degree murder ; prosecutors say they *'ll* seek a new trial
the teen killed , @entity20 , would have celebrated his 19th birthday sunday
