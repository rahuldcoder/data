@entity0 per household to residents displaced or forced indoors by the nuclear accident there , @entity3 's government ordered friday			1
the @entity11 will start handing out checks " as smoothly and as early as possible , " hopefully by april 28 , its president , @entity10 , told reporters			1
sole residents will receive 750,000 yen and multi-person households will get 1 million , @entity10 said , with the company 's interim cost estimated at about $ 600 million			1
a government committee ordered the payments as an advance on the compensation that @entity11 will owe nearby residents and businesses for the month - old crisis at @entity6 , chief cabinet secretary @entity25 said friday			1
@entity25 said the government hopes to have payments in residents ' hands by @entity3 's " @entity30 , " a string of national holidays that begins april 29			2
@entity11 offered a token payment to residents of 10 municipalities around the plant in early april			1
but officials in one of those towns , @entity40 , rejected the offer , saying it amounted to about $ 12 for each of its roughly 20,000 residents			0
@entity11 has no timetable for resolving the accident , and the yet - unknown cost of compensation has called the survival of @entity3 's largest utility into question			1
the @entity3 government has agreed to support the company to keep power flowing to its 25 million customers without big rate increases , deputy finance minister @entity53 told @entity1 , but he said a government takeover of the utility was unlikely			1
" the way the government will approach that is still in the decision process , " @entity53 said			0
the utility reported 2010 profits of more than 1.4 trillion yen ( $ 17 billion )			2
about 78,000 people living within 20 kilometers ( 12.4 miles ) of the plant were ordered out of their homes in the days after the march 11 accident , which now is ranked at the top of the international scale for nuclear disasters			1
those living another 10 kilometers out were told to remain indoors as the plant belched radioactive particles into the environment from three damaged reactors			2
monday , @entity3 authorities told residents of five municipalities in that outer belt and beyond to evacuate within a month , due to lower levels of radioactive contamination that are likely to pose a long - term health hazard			2
other towns have been put on notice that evacuations may be required soon , bringing the total number of people directly affected so far to about 146,000 , according to @entity3 government estimates			1
but in @entity91 , the @entity90 on friday lifted a departure recommendation for families of @entity95 diplomats in @entity3			1
while it still advises @entity95 to stay more than 50 kilometers from the plant , the latest notice calls the situation " dramatically different " than in mid-march			1
" today , while the situation remains serious , and there is still a possibility of unanticipated developments , cooling efforts are ongoing and successful , power , water supply , and back - up services have been partially or fully restored , and planning has begun to control radioactive contamination and mitigate future dangers , " the travel alert states			2
plant workers have been battling to cool the cores of reactors 1 - 3 at @entity6 , about 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0 , for a month			1
the plant was swamped by the tsunami that followed march 11 's historic earthquake , knocking out normal coolant systems			2
all three cores are believed to have been damaged by overheating in the aftermath of the tsunami , but a friday report by the @entity122 of @entity3 painted a fresh picture of the extent of the damage			1
the zirconium alloy sheaths that surround the fuel rods in the reactor core are believed to have ruptured in all three units , sending molten uranium fuel pellets tumbling to the bottom of the reactors			0
the pellets are since believed to have cooled and solidified at the reactor bases or in the framework of the fuel assembly , according to the report			0
the @entity122 is an association of nuclear engineers , scientists and professors			0
its deputy director , @entity142 , called the new account the clearest picture to date of conditions inside the damaged reactors			1
" it 's our best effort to imagine what the core looks like , " he said			0
about 70 % of the fuel rods in the no. 1 reactor have been damaged , the report states			2
in reactor no. 2 , that figure is 30 % , and in no. 3 , 25 %			0
in addition , the pools that house used but still - energetic spent fuel assemblies are an ongoing concern , @entity142 said			0
hydrogen explosions blew apart the reactor buildings at units 1 and 2 , while the no. 4 reactor building has been damaged by fires of still - unknown origin -- leaving the pools exposed to the environment			0
" if there 's water enough , there 's no problem , " he said			0
" but if some of the fuel is damaged , fission products will come out from those pools			0
" at the plant on friday , efforts continued to drain highly radioactive water from the basements and service tunnels of the reactor units ' turbine plants -- a necessary first step to restoring normal cooling systems			0
@entity3 authorities drew the ire of fishermen and some of their country 's neighbors by authorizing the dumping of thousands of tons of less - contaminated water into the @entity193 last week			2
the 10,000 - plus ton discharge was billed as an emergency measure aimed at making room for the more dangerous fluid , some of which is believed to be leaking from the no. 2 reactor			0
more than 9,000 tons of that came from a waste treatment facility at the plant , which could hold up to 30,000 tons now that it 's empty , @entity11 officials said			1
crews have been laying fresh pipes to the treatment center and hope to start transferring water from unit 2 on sunday , the company said			0
but its capacity could be only a fraction of the volume now sloshing around in the turbine building basements , and engineers are still pouring hundreds of tons of water into the reactors every day to keep them cool			0
@entity219 and @entity1 's @entity220 contributed to this report for @entity1 .			0
