-- it is one of the painful ironies of our time that in the same season @entity9 's memory is finally honored with a memorial in our nation 's capital , the state where he began to lead the civil rights movement is once more the center of an ugly conflict over racial injustice			1
the passage of @entity19 's anti-immigrant legislation , @entity20 56 , invokes inhumanity reminiscent of the @entity22			1
and the police state it has created is equally cruel			0
if the law stands , children will be denied admission to public schools if they ca n't prove their citizenship , and schools will be turned into enforcement operations			0
poor people of color will be ripped from their families if they are caught in public without their papers in order			0
samaritans and people of conscience who employ , harbor or help undocumented workers will be severely punished			0
already , opportunistic corrections firms are standing by to pocket money off prejudice and terrified families are selling off their meager possessions and fleeing the state			1
our immigration system is broken , but our answer as a nation can not be to terrorize and criminalize families			1
our immigration policy must be consistent with our core values and our moral obligation to treat all people with dignity and respect			2
for all the differences that divide us , we are in this together			0
in these harsh economic times , we are more than ever wearing the " single garment of destiny " of which @entity9 wrote in his " @entity65			2
" when communities suffer discrimination and degradation , we all suffer			0
when some citizens are denied fair treatment , we are all denied			0
when any group of workers can be underpaid and overworked , all workers are victimized			0
when families are threatened if they dare organize or speak out , @entity74 is threatened			0
" sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application , " @entity9 also wrote in " @entity65 , " where he was imprisoned for nonviolent civil disobedience			1
much about our nation 's immigration practices echoes that observation			2
we call on president @entity84 to oppose and terminate all programs -- including collaboration between state and local law enforcement and the @entity89 -- that result in racial profiling and target immigrant communities			1
our focus should be on comprehensive immigration reform			1
and we must focus simultaneously on fixing our broken economy , an economy that is forcing 99 % of the people to compete for a smaller and smaller piece of the receding @entity98			1
we also hope the good and righteous people of @entity19 will rise up , oppose and repeal the abomination that is @entity20			2
theirs is the state where our historic civil rights movement began , where @entity9 and his followers developed a model of nonviolent activism that changed not only @entity107 and @entity19 and the @entity22 , but our entire nation			1
this week , a delegation of @entity112 labor and civil rights leaders are visiting @entity19 to support @entity114 families who face hostilities all too familiar to what @entity9 saw in 1963			1
perhaps the ugly problems in @entity19 can once again play a part in building a new understanding about the strains of division that weaken the fabric of society for all of us			2
