-- @entity2 fashion designer and film director @entity1 has revealed he received angry letters from his predecessor and rival @entity7			1
@entity1 , 49 , took over @entity9 's eponymous fashion house in 1999 when parts of it were sold to the @entity12 , where @entity13 was creative director			1
and the designer says that while the pair started as friends , the relationship soon soured -- to the point that @entity7 , one of the pioneering figures in @entity19 fashion , accused @entity13 of ruining his reputation			1
even in public comments , the @entity25 had made no secret of his disdain for @entity13 's taste			1
" he was supportive at the beginning , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity30			1
" he loved the fact that we were buying the company , and he loved the fact that i was designing , and he had been very complimentary of my work at @entity12			2
" we were quite friendly , and had dinner a few times , and my first collection , i had him up to show it to him			0
" our business was doubling and doubling and doubling , and when i started to get great press and the business started to become very successful , @entity9 became really quite hostile			2
" i have letters that he wrote to me about it , you know : ' in 13 minutes on the runway you have destroyed 40 years of my career			1
' " i am really happy i have them -- they are written in his own hand			0
when i 'm 85 , maybe i 'll put them in a book -- if anyone cares			0
" @entity1 left @entity12 in 2004 , before setting up his own label -- @entity1 -- something he told @entity0 had previously frightened him			1
" i guess what i feared was that with many designers , they sell their own labels , they lose control of their labels , perhaps things are then created which then go very much against their taste level			0
" your name is a funny thing			0
it stands for what you 're about and everything i do is really about pride			0
" i do n't work for money any longer			0
i 'm fortunate enough not to need to work for money , but i work for pride , i work because i love to work , and so the idea that one could lose control of one 's own name and that things could be produced with your name on that you were not proud of scared me			2
" the designer has also broadened his career path in recent years , moving into film with the award - winning @entity90 adaptation " @entity92 , " starring @entity93 as a gay @entity95 university professor unable to cope in 1960s @entity96 after the sudden death of his partner @entity1 told @entity0 the shift towards @entity100 " felt totally natural			1
" " i know a lot of people in the film industry , and everyone was incredibly supportive			2
there 's a line that people in @entity100 can ' nice you to death ' , so you have to take it with a grain of salt , but they were incredibly polite , incredibly supportive			0
" it was n't until after i had made my film that almost every interviewer said : ' what was it like , making a film and having it turn out as a success when everyone thought you were crazy ? ' " and i thought ' people thought i was crazy ? you mean people did n't actually think i could do this ? ' " i had a very clear picture of what i wanted the film to be , and i 'm not going to say that there were n't things that i learned and that i did n't know , but directing a film is not that dissimilar to being the creative director of a large fashion house			1
" first of all , you have to have a vision ; that 's the most important thing			0
why does anybody need to see a @entity1 film ? why does anyone need a @entity1 jacket ? so you have to have something to say			2
" then you have to hire a great team of people to help you realize that vision , and you have to create an environment where those people can be creative , and give you their very best			0
" then you have to slowly guide carefully that team of people to help you realize your vision			0
so the dynamics of film directing and fashion design -- in the ways that i 've done it -- were not dissimilar			1
" @entity7 retired from the fashion industry in 2002 , and died in june 2008 of brain cancer at age 71 .			2

fashion designer @entity1 *explains* how his relationship with @entity7 *deteriorated*
one letter accused @entity13 of destroying the @entity25 icon 's 40 - year career in 13 minutes
@entity13 was creative director at @entity12 when it bought @entity7 fashion house
