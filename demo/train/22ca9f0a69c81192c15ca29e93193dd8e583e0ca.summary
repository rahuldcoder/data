-- most people probably recognize @entity2 from her current role on @entity5 's " @entity4 " or from her stint on @entity8 's " scrubs " as @entity9 , a musician who performed for patients			1
but what made that first " @entity7 " character special was that @entity9 was specifically written for @entity2 and her rather unusual talent : playing the ukulele			1
" i auditioned for ' @entity7 ' and they saw the ( @entity17 ukulele ) videos and thought , well why do n't we write this girl a part , " she says			2
" so they made me a ukulele player			0
" one video in particular that truly helped spawn @entity2 's acting career was her song " @entity26			1
" it starts : dear deer : i am writing you a letter in the hopes that you 'll know better not to go in the woods in @entity34 ' cause my dad 's in a tree waiting to kill ya just be warned @entity2 recalls how the videos began : " this great director , @entity39 , saw me singing at a little art gallery and he was like , ' hey , i 'd love to make a video for you			0
" acting aside , true fans probably now love her best as being one half of the comedy singing duo @entity46			1
the other half is her good friend and fellow actress @entity49			0
( for those of you who are wondering , @entity49 is " garfunkel , " thus making @entity53			0
" ) @entity2 and @entity49 's music act also harnessed the power of @entity17 , and they eventually reached a certain level of stardom with their politically motivated tune " @entity64 , " in which they rejoice in the exciting possibilities from the slippery slope of legalizing gay marriage : @entity65 once said , it 's a long downward slide that 'll lead to legalizing sex with ducks if two men can stand @entity71 @entity70 , i hope he 's right ' cause if gay marriage becomes lawful gon na find myself a duck and legally do something awful no ducks were available for comment			1
in february , @entity46 released their debut album " @entity80 , " and the two continue to perform regularly			0
when @entity2 met with @entity0 in @entity82 , she did n't have her ukulele			2
however , @entity0 presented her with a used $ 60 ukulele purchased earlier from a little shop down the street			0
after careful inspection , @entity2 said , " it sounds great ! ... good purchase ! " and then she performed a funny song about napping with a stranger .			2

comedian @entity2 plays the ukulele , which helped her get a part on " scrubs "
@entity2 is part of a comedy band called @entity46
their political song , " sex with @entity64 , " is about gay marriage
