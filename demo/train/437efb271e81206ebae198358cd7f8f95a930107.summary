-- fifty - four years after the @entity3 , @entity4 , school board ignored the wishes of students and named a @entity8 high school for a controversial @entity10 general , the school will be getting a new name			1
the school board voted 7 - 0 monday to change the name of @entity13 after the current school year ends			1
officials will choose between the names @entity17 and @entity18 in january			1
when it was opened in 1959 , in the aftermath of the @entity23 decision that required racially integrated public schools , district officials chose to name the school after @entity26 -- a former slave trader and @entity10 commander whose troops were involved in the massacre of black @entity32 soldiers at a @entity34 fort			1
he later served as the first " @entity35 " of the @entity36			2
" for too long and too many , this name has represented the opposite of unity , respect , and equality -- all that we expect in @entity3 schools , " board member @entity37 said in a statement from the district			1
the name - change was spearheaded by parent @entity49 , whose change.org petition amassed 162,150 signatures			0
" i 'm very encouraged			0
@entity8 is too much of a beautiful city to have that ugly blemish , " @entity49 told @entity0 affiliate @entity52			1
" i do n't want my daughter , or any student , going to a school named under those circumstances , " he said in his petition			2
" this is a bad look for @entity4 -- with so much racial division in our state , renaming @entity64 would be a step toward healing			1
" a kinder , gentler @entity36 ? ' we do n't hate anymore , ' imperial wizard says at the time it was named , the segregated school had an all - white student body			2
it is now 62 % black , 23 % white and 9 % @entity72 , according to the district			0
still , the decision to strip the name was not universally popular			0
more than half of the faculty opposed the change , as did 36 % of students , the district said			0
a @entity82 @entity36 leader also protested the change , saying those who want the name changed are ignoring " the true historical facts surrounding this valiant man of honor			0
" @entity90 fans have noted the commander 's widespread reputation as a military genius , and have long said he was misunderstood			2
they say he disbanded the first version of the @entity36 after it grew violent and argue that he made efforts to reconcile with blacks in his later years			0
he is the subject of numerous monuments and other efforts to preserve his memory across the @entity102			0
a monument honoring @entity26 has been the subject of long - running controversy in @entity106 , @entity107 , a focal point of the civil rights movement			1
the monument was located in a city building for a while but moved to a city - owned cemetery following protests			0
in 2012 , someone stole @entity26 's bust from atop the monument			1
efforts to refurbish the monument have resulted in disputes			0
in 2011 , a @entity123 proposal to create a license plate honoring @entity26 brought opposition by civil rights groups and never saw the light of day			1
group demands @entity130 high school change ' @entity132 ' team name , mascot			2

@entity8 , @entity4 , school board votes to drop name of @entity10 general from school
*critics* say @entity26 was slave trader whose name should not grace a school
*supporters* of keeping the name say @entity26 was misunderstood
the new name will hopefully be chosen in january
