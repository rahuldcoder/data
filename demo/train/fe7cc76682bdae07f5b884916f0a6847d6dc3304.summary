-- the first weekend of the @entity1 brought us moments of humor and technical problems from the @entity6 , a skater 's reaction that went viral and the sparkling debut of a sport where " stoked " and " dude " are part of a winning news conference			1
that face oh , how we love figure skating , a sport with subjective scores			2
and just like gymnastics -- another subjective scoring sport -- two years ago , it 's given us what should become an @entity23 internet meme			2
on saturday , @entity25 skater @entity24 went to the kiss - and - cry area to await her score in the women 's short program of the team competition			1
she obviously expected a higher score than she received			1
a picture of her pouty face after the score was announced is drawing as much attention as the one that showed gymnast @entity39 's reaction after she got a silver medal in 2012			1
but if you watch videos of @entity44 's reaction , she also seemed to use her potty mouth , saying something with bull in it			2
" i know roughly when i skate a good program where the score should end up			1
so to score that low was very disappointing for me , " @entity44 said			1
@entity44 's the early favorite to become the meme star of the @entity54			2
she might have to compete with @entity25 bobsledder @entity56 and one smashed - out bathroom door			1
bobsledder to front desk : yeah , i need a new door smashing debut step aside for a second , curling			2
it looks like slopestyle is a new fan favorite			2
especially in the @entity25 , which took gold in both the men 's and women 's events			1
@entity71 and @entity72 turned many viewers into fans with their winning performances			2
at its first games , the sport lit up the first two days of @entity78			2
in a very unscientific poll , @entity0 users said the women 's final was more exciting than the men 's , which left a lot of people pretty stoked , including the surprise winner			1
incredibly , @entity88 ( you ca n't call a snowboarder by his last name , can you ? ) won while breaking out a new trick			1
after all , what did he have to lose ? besides a gold medal			1
" i just kind of do random stuff			2
i had no idea i 'd do a 1620 ( four - and - a - half rotation spin ) until three minutes before i dropped			2
i invented that ( the self - named ' @entity97 ' ) a few months ago , and it was sick to do it on the first try			2
" @entity102 dude looks like @entity103 in the women 's final @entity71 was no surprise			1
she dominated this season , according to @entity108			0
how did she prepare for the big day ? " last night i was so nervous i did n't eat			0
i put on the meditation music , burnt some sage and did some yoga , " she said			0
we 're guessing there were n't too many other people in the athletes ' village doing that			1
viral moments from the @entity6 things do n't always go according to script at the @entity6			1
four years ago in @entity121 , a really cool lighting of the cauldron went awry when one of the four arms did n't rise from the floor of the stadium			1
on friday night , five snowflake lights were supposed to morph into the five @entity1 rings			0
ok , a minor glitch in what was otherwise a terrific show			0
nothing to send someone to @entity135 over			0
so do n't believe it when you see the headline in your @entity140 news feed : " @entity142			0
" the person who posted it and wrote , " is this true ? " did n't take much time to check the @entity146 to see if something they posted on the @entity146 was true			0
it was satire from the @entity151 , which also once ran the headline : " marijuana overdoses kill 37 in @entity153 on @entity154			0
" in @entity156 , viewers saw the snowflakes work what was true at the @entity6 was the picture that came with the caption , " @entity161 ' get lucky ' at @entity6			1
" yes , @entity162 's catchy " get lucky			1
" yes , the @entity156 police have a choir			1
yes , many of them have perplexed looks on their faces			0
family tradition for downhill skier there are now two @entity23 medals in his family after @entity176 's @entity175 picked the perfect moment to win his first major downhill			1
in upsetting pre-race favorites @entity181 of the @entity25 and world downhill champion @entity183 of @entity185 , the 23 - year - old skier added his gold to his father @entity187 's @entity189 silver in 1988			1
i thought maybe in a few years i could dream of this sort of achievement			0
it was really cool and my family will be excited , " he said			1
for @entity183 , the disappointment is huge			0
" it is pretty much the worst place to be , " he said			2
@entity181 , at 36 the old man of alpine skiing , finished eighth in his last @entity23 downhill			0
he seemed to be in good shape until he hit a gate , @entity108 said			0
" i 'm not really sure what went wrong , " he said			0
" the visibility is different today and that 's the only disadvantage i had			0
but it 's something i face all the time			0
if the visibility is really good , i can ski my best ; if it is n't , i ca n't			0
i wanted to ski ( the course ) as hard as i could and not really back off , but it requires a lot of tactics today , which i did n't apply			0
" he still has the super combined on friday -- the event he won in 2010 -- for a chance at a sixth career medal			1
the host nation comes to life and a 15 - year - old shall lead them			0
@entity156 picked up four medals on sunday , sparked by figure skater @entity226 , who crushed the competition in the women 's free skate program of the team event , a day after winning the short program			1
and her team smoked the competition to win the host nation 's first gold medal of the @entity54			1
the win pleased no. 1 @entity156 fan , president @entity237 , but he reminded the team he hoped for more medals			1
" he congratulated us at the boards , which was great			0
he said , ' well done , but do n't relax , you still have the individual events to come , ' " @entity243 said			0
he was so happy , he almost managed a smile , reported @entity0 's @entity247			0
@entity156 also won medals in the women 's biathlon sprint ( silver ) , men 's singles luge ( silver ) and women 's 3,000 - meter speed skating event			1
back to the ice , there 's a bit of bad news for the other women in the individual competition			2
" now i fully know the ice and the arena i can relax a bit and skate better in the individual event than i did today , " @entity226 said after the team event			0
" i will work hard on the free program after the small issues today			0
" you read that right : as good as she was sunday , she thinks she will be better .			0

@entity24 appeared to say a bad word after her score was announced
@entity275 , dude , is pretty cool , and we 're not just sayin ' that because @entity25 won
@entity162 song gets the choir *treatment* in @entity6
@entity237 almost looks like he had fun watching @entity156 win first gold medal
