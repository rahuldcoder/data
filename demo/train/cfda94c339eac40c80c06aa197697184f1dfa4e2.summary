-- @entity2 's top intelligence official on thursday night challenged news reports claiming @entity5 posts , @entity7 messages and more have been intercepted for years in a vast data - mining operation , saying the reports " contain numerous inaccuracies			1
" the @entity11 , a @entity13 newspaper , and the @entity14 reported thursday that @entity2 intelligence agencies had access to the central servers of nine of the country 's biggest technology firms including @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity5			1
the @entity14 reported the program -- called @entity26 -- underwent " exponential growth " since its founding in 2007			1
in fact , the newspaper said the program has become the leading source of raw material for the @entity32 , the secretive @entity2 intelligence operation that monitors electronic communications			1
yet several tech giants whose servers were reportedly ensnared in the program denied any knowledge of it thursday			1
and @entity39 , the director of national intelligence , questioned the @entity11 and @entity14 articles in a statement thursday night			1
he referred to @entity42 of the @entity43 , which he noted was recently reauthorized by @entity45 -- one of the bodies , along with the executive branch and @entity49 , with oversight over aspects of intelligence gathering			0
section 702 , @entity39 added , " is designed to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non- @entity2 persons located outside the @entity2			1
" " it can not be used to intentionally target any @entity2 citizen , any other @entity2 person , or anyone located within the @entity2 , " he said in his statement			2
while he made no mention of data mining , @entity39 did defend the @entity2 intelligence effort generally , saying , " information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect , and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats			1
" @entity39 also called out the person or people behind " the unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program , " saying such apparent leaks are " reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of @entity2			1
" the @entity14 reported that its reporters had been provided a detailed briefing presentation document on the prism program			2
the program has been running since 2007 and has undergone " exponential growth " since then , the @entity14 reported			2
it is now the leading source of raw material for the @entity32 , the secretive @entity2 intelligence operation that monitors electronic communications			1
according to a briefing slide published by the @entity11 , @entity26 began with data from @entity21 in 2007			2
the program began collecting data from @entity24 in 2008 and from @entity23 , @entity5 and the message system @entity95 in 2009			2
@entity96 became a source in 2010 , @entity98 and @entity99 in 2011 and @entity22 in late 2012 , the slide claims			2
the @entity32 declined to comment , but several companies -- many of them using similar language -- denied thursday any knowledge of such a program			0
@entity21 , for instance , said in a statement it only provides user data when legally required and for specific accounts -- adding that " if the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we do n't participate in it			0
" @entity113 , a spokeswoman for @entity5 , said the social media giant works to " carefully scrutinize any ... request for compliance " and does not give government agencies " direct access " to its servers			1
@entity22 spokesman @entity120 offered a similar response -- saying @entity22 hands over information only when a government agency gets a court order			0
@entity120 added that his company has never heard of @entity26			0
" we disclose user data to government in accordance with the law , and we review all such requests carefully , " a @entity23 spokesman said in response to the stories			0
" from time to time , people allege that we have created a government ' back door ' into our systems , but @entity23 does not have a ' back door ' for the government to access private user data			0
" even with these denials and @entity39 's defense , president @entity145 's administration has come under growing scrutiny in recent days over his record on balancing citizens ' right to privacy and the government 's efforts to combat terrorism			0
@entity156 at center of @entity159 phone log controversy that includes news , first reported on wednesday by the @entity11 and commented on by @entity2 politicians , that the @entity163 and @entity32 have been collecting the phone records of millions of @entity2 -- specifically @entity159 customers and perhaps others -- over a several year period			1
days after taking office in 2009 , @entity145 vowed , " transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency			0
" but on thursday , the left - leaning @entity173 conflated @entity145 with his predecessor @entity174 while a @entity176 editorial said " the administration has now lost all credibility " when it comes to overreaching in the name of fighting terrorism			0
" mr. @entity145 is proving the truism that the executive branch will use any power it is given and very likely abuse it , " the @entity176 ' editorial said			0
what does the @entity159 order mean for me ? @entity0 's @entity189 and @entity190 contributed to this report .			0
