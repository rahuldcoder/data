-- during the past two years , i have been digging into the intimate relationships of 150 women , ages 20 through 90 , for my new book , " @entity4 ... women share how intimacy changes as @entity8			1
" i take readers from the honeymoon hots through tepid midlife to some surprisingly steamy senior sex			1
many of my subjects describe easy and sexy romances ; others are pushing through emotional and physical roadblocks			1
here are snapshots of some of those stories of tough love			1
postpartum blues between 10 - 15 % of women suffer from postpartum depression that affects sexual desire and can cause serious rifts in a young marriage			1
@entity30 psychologist @entity29 's struggle through the blues after childbirth led her to create a specialty practice in treating clients with postpartum mood disorders			1
@entity29 's own depression was so severe that for a flash she considered taking her own life			1
with the help of a supportive husband , therapy and anti-depressants , she fought her way back			2
here is a snippet of our interview that appears in the " @entity49 " chapter : i see in my practice that sex can really cause a lot of distance between the couple			1
the spouse is thinking , " all right , the @entity57 said we could have sex after six weeks			1
let 's go to it , honey			1
" and the new mom is telling me , " @entity64 , i ca n't do this yet			2
i am still fat and sad and i am not ready to have anyone close to me -- other than the baby ! " i tell them my own story , that there is hope -- i 'm at a really good place now			2
you go from not feeling sexy at all and trying to get across to your partner , " hey these are not your boobs right now ' to feeling ' hey i 'm ready , let 's do it '			1
' it 's only a leg ' @entity82 's husband , @entity81 , was deployed to @entity83 three weeks after their wedding			1
she was 20 , and he was 22			2
six months later , @entity81 stepped on an improvised explosive device and lost part of his right leg			2
to add to the bedlam of this tragedy , @entity82 gave birth to their daughter , @entity92 , early on in @entity81 's treatment at @entity95			1
after excruciating hard work to become intimate again , emotionally and physically , they are now enjoying " full - on sex , " @entity82 told me , and a very sturdy marriage			1
here is a portion of her story : when this first happened to @entity81 , i just felt helpless , like i would never get my husband back			2
he was so depressed and angry , and he also had post traumatic stress disorder			2
i felt like leaving the marriage , and it was hard to become intimate again			2
he 'd want to have sex , but with the pain in his leg , he could n't bear weight			1
once we figured out how to finally do it , every time we 'd finish with an orgasm , his leg would jolt with pain			1
it made me feel really bad because he would say " i want to have sex with you , " but it would hurt him afterward			1
honestly , we do n't have sex in long sessions any more like we used to because he just gets tired more quickly			1
i do n't really mind			2
at least i have my husband ! you come to realize that love in marriage comes from so many other things than what our bodies can do			2
it 's only a leg ; i 've seen far worse when we were at @entity95			1
there were many men with two and three limbs missing , plus genital injuries			2
sex after breast cancer five years ago , @entity136 was diagnosed with @entity138 breast cancer at 37			1
she had her left breast removed and reconstructed , then endured months of chemotherapy and radiation that left her weak and bald and frightened that she would not live to see her two young kids enter kindergarten			2
tanned in a low - cut sundress , today @entity136 is cancer - free , and she offers a hopeful message to the one in eight @entity149 women who will be struck with breast cancer in their lifetimes			1
here is a swatch of our conversation : my husband was surprisingly turned on by my new look			2
it was like he got to sleep with another woman			2
though i am not thrilled with the way my chest looks			2
i prefer to have sex with my shirt on now , because it makes me think less about how my breasts used to be			1
recovering from cancer , while the physical intimacy was good , i would often feel like i needed more emotional support from him			2
and i should have asked for it ; this is a lesson i can pass on to other women in my situation			1
i created the problem really , because in my efforts to be strong in front of the kids and to just keep going forward , i let my husband assume i was invincible			0
and he was so turned on by how tough i was , this warrior woman , i did n't let myself be weak with him			0
in retrospect , i should have told him the truth , that i was often tired			0
that i was scared the cancer would come back			0
that i was vulnerable and just needed him to hold me			0
let 's talk about sex ... and cancer the midlife itch the 15 - year mark in a marriage is a popular juncture for divorce and infidelity			1
affairs that are outed can either wreck a marriage or open communication lines , as remorse leads to forgiveness and potentially a more honest union			0
increasingly , though , i found in composing this book that many people who take on lovers do so in secret , so as not to rock the boat			0
@entity201 , 53 , is a married mother of five who last year reconnected with the " soul mate who got away			0
" they are now lovers , and she is determined to keep both men in her life			0
here is part of her story in the " @entity211 " chapter : this previous boyfriend was my first love and my greatest lover			0
yet i do not want to leave my husband and hurt him			0
my marriage is a good one			0
i love both men , and i have chosen to keep both men			0
a secret life can be very sexually affirming if it stays a secret			0
if i went to a therapist , she would say " choose			0
" i ca n't choose			0
i get the best of both worlds : i have the stability and security of my husband , an intact family for my children , and i have the passion that i want and need in my life			0
sex after widowhood while researching " sex after ... , " i looked for older women whose husbands had died recently and had been their only lovers			1
those wives who had nursed husbands through long illnesses were clearly grieving , yet they admitted to some relief			0
@entity241 was married for 55 years in what she described as a " wonderful love affair			0
" her husband suffered from a chronic heart condition for most of those years and finally succumbed to leukemia			1
at 80 , she has found solace with an old friend her age who had also lost his wife			0
i love @entity241 's story , a portion of which she tells below , and the hopeful stories like hers in the " @entity256 " chapter that shatter myths of the little old lady as fragile and dried up			1
i never thought i would ever want to get involved with another man			0
our friend @entity261 would ask me out , and i would say , " i 'm not ready			0
" he was very romantic and persistent , though			0
he would send me long - stemmed white roses every two weeks			0
i finally went on a date with him on @entity266			1
but i was still afraid to touch another man			0
at midnight , i would n't go near him			0
then about a year after my husband died , @entity261 asked me to go to @entity270 with him			0
i said , " ok , i guess it 's time to try you out			1
" my husband was the only man i 'd ever slept with , so being intimate with another man was very scary			0
without giving you details , let me just say things are going well			0
i feel wonderful , like a teenager			0
the love , the making love -- it 's so romantic it 's almost electrifying			1
after taking care of someone so ill for so many years , this is fantastic			0
finding love in my 80s is like opening another world i never knew could exist			0
not only do i have a golf partner and a life partner , but the sex part is very , very good			1
it is not " @entity292 , " but it is definitely erotic and warm and beautiful			0
do you have a story about acclimating to sex after a major life change ? please share in the comments section , but keep it clean !			1
