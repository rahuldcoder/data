@entity0 , @entity1 -- about 10 days ago , @entity3 took ill , but not with @entity4			1
her son , @entity5 , says his mother was having violent convulsions			1
those are n't a typical symptom of @entity4 ; they 're a complication of high blood pressure , which @entity13 had suffered from for years			1
@entity5 drove his mother to @entity14 , near their home in the @entity18 slums of @entity0			1
doctors had given her treatment there before , and he hoped to get it again			1
but @entity24 , like so many hospitals in @entity1 , is closed or partially closed out of fear that @entity4 patients will infect health care workers			1
it 's a fear based in reality : in @entity1 , more than 170 health care workers have contracted the disease and 83 have died of it			1
next , @entity5 drove to @entity33 , but learned it only takes @entity4 patients			1
then he drove his mother to @entity35 , but it was overwhelmed and accepting only pregnant women , children and @entity4 patients			1
@entity39 was his last chance			2
@entity5 and his mother waited outside			2
by now she was convulsing every 15 minutes , " as if someone had put a spell on her , " he says			2
her breathing was rapid and shallow			2
a doctor came out -- a tall man , @entity5 remembers			2
he pointed to a small blood stain on his mother 's shirt			1
he wanted to know what it was from			2
@entity5 explained that during one of her seizures his mother had bit her tongue and bled a little			2
but he could tell the doctor was worried she had @entity4 , because bleeding is one of the symptoms			1
@entity3 had run out of options			2
the only place her son could take her was home			2
four days later , on september 19 , she died			0
" if the hospitals were open , she would n't have died , " he says			1
" this was n't her time to go			0
" no contact : life inside the @entity4 outbreak there 's no question that countless @entity1 are dying because of @entity4 even when they do n't have it			1
there are few functioning hospitals or doctors ' offices			1
health care services , weak before @entity4 , barely exist ; vaccination rates , for example , have plummeted			1
" the primary care system here is basically shattered , " says @entity79 , a spokeswoman for @entity80 who is working in @entity1			1
" it 's an outrage that children are dying of diseases , like measles , that are preventable and treatable			0
" even after death , @entity4 -- a disease her son says she never had -- haunted @entity13			1
her family heard on the radio that no one should touch a cadaver , no matter what the cause of death			0
call in , the announcer on the radio said , and a team from @entity99 will come for the body			0
it 's simply impractical to test every cadaver for @entity4 and sort out who died of what before burial			1
it would dangerously delay the burial to do so , and would take up too many resources			0
so the @entity13 family did as they were instructed			0
on saturday , the day after her death , a team of five men in white suits , covered head to toe , sprayed @entity3 's body with chlorine and buried her			0
@entity13 did n't receive the burial she would have wanted as a devout @entity120			0
her family did n't wash her body			0
they did n't carry her to the mosque and pray over her			0
they did n't bury her themselves			0
" these guys who buried her -- i do n't know these guys , " @entity5 says , referring to the men in the white suits with the chlorine spray			0
" i expected my family to bury her , but now strangers have buried her			0
" but he says he understands			0
" i have to accept this because this is the kind of country i live in and the kind of country my mother died in , " he says			0
" i have to accept it with a heavy heart			0
" @entity2 's @entity141 , @entity142 , and @entity143 contributed to this story .			0
