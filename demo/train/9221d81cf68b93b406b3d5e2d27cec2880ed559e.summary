-- @entity1 , dislike , even hatred are common emotions in the workplace			2
add testosterone and adrenaline to the pot , stir and you have a potentially combustible concoction -- just ask @entity11 and @entity12			1
in august 1992 , @entity11 and @entity12 had much to celebrate as the duo became the first @entity15 tennis team to win @entity17 gold -- beating @entity18 to claim the men 's doubles title in @entity21			1
the @entity21 night was young and @entity11 had arranged a dinner that night for @entity12 and a couple of other @entity15 athletes , but @entity11 says his partner preferred to take the first plane out of @entity27 rather than toast their success			1
twenty years on , two of @entity15 's most celebrated tennis players -- whose personal relationship was limited by an intense rivalry -- have still to raise a glass to their historic win			1
" when we won , all i remember was just hugging each other , like we were brothers , but believe me -- that would have been impossible a week prior to the tournament , " @entity11 told @entity0			1
" hopefully , one day we will be mature enough to sit down , have a bottle of red wine and just talk ( about it )			0
" you know , i won it because of him and he won it because of me			0
it 's never going to go away so hopefully , we 'll be able to celebrate this great achievement one of these years			1
" the @entity17 had come at the height of the duo 's rivalry , says @entity11 , with the pair not just the best tennis players in @entity15 but also the world , as they vied with one another for major honors			1
only a year earlier , @entity12 had beaten @entity11 in the first all - @entity15 men 's final at @entity59			1
yet although the partnership 's strength was tested on repeated occasions in @entity21 , with their last three matches all going to five sets , @entity12 and @entity11 came through -- a result of single - minded ambition in their two - man team , says a @entity70 sports psychologist			1
" research has shown that their rivalry would not necessarily have affected the outcome because they would still have wanted to win for themselves , " says @entity71			1
" there may have been hostility on a social level but it was only what happened on court -- and coming together to achieve their task -- that mattered			0
" @entity11 says it was during the quarterfinal against @entity21 's @entity87 and @entity88 , who were both higher - ranked and playing at home , that the @entity15 team finally put their egos aside , once they realized that only teamwork could pull them through			1
" when i 'm working with teams as a psychologist , i reinforce the concept that if we are going to set team goals then everyone needs to be working together , " says @entity71 , who is currently working for @entity94 football club @entity93			2
" it is not the end of the world if players are not friends			0
research in sports psychology suggests that players do not have to like each other for a team to be successful			0
" down the rabbit hole : depression in the @entity94 there can be fewer finer examples of that across any discipline than the on - field relationship between former @entity118 strikers @entity119 and @entity120			1
during their four years at @entity118 , the pair formed a fluid forward partnership that contributed to three league titles , one @entity125 and a @entity127 crown			0
all of this was achieved despite the fact that they never talked to one another , with @entity119 having taken grave offense to a perceived slight from @entity120 during the former 's @entity135 debut in 1995			0
@entity119 , who is still the @entity94 's second highest scorer of all time , said in 2010 that he would rather socialize with a player who broke his leg in two places than " with @entity120 , who i 've pretty much detested for the past 15 years			2
" we played together for years			0
we scored a lot of goals			0
i never spoke a single word to him			0
' " one reason why @entity120 and @entity119 could channel their enmity for the good of the team was the influence of sir @entity153			0
the @entity118 manager has handled countless dressing room rows during his time -- and he is not afraid to drop players in a bid to promote competition , as he did last month when benching @entity160 in favor of new signing @entity162			2
" team sports can often be individual sports because each individual is trying to be chosen for the team and garner the manager 's attentions , so team sports lend towards some rivalry within the team , " says @entity164			2
" that can be a good thing for management because if you have two players vying for a place , that brings out the best of them in training , their focus and in matches			0
" however , it can be detrimental to their performance on the pitch if they are not working cohesively so it can be a double - edged sword			2
" football 's most poisonous rivalry ? @entity190 and @entity118 's tempestuous past there are a host of examples of teams that have suffered when protagonists have clashed -- with @entity198 footballers regularly falling out before suffering premature exits at major international competitions , their @entity202 counterparts doing their best to emulate them in recent tournaments while teams in golf 's @entity205 and @entity207 have been undone by feuding stars down the years			1
the 2004 @entity205 was a case in point as @entity212 captain @entity211 made an enormous gamble as he paired two very contrasting figures together , in the hope that @entity216 and @entity217 could set aside their differences to create a " @entity220 "			0
a pairing described as making " oil and water look like a perfect match " duly lost both their matches as they helped the @entity226 retain the trophy in comprehensive fashion			0
meanwhile , intra-team rivalries have ruined partnerships in @entity207 , with @entity231 and @entity232 repeatedly at loggerheads during their time together at @entity234 in the late 1980s			2
although their two years together resulted in a championship apiece , their frequent clashes -- some of which came on the track -- prompted the @entity202 to leave @entity234 , no doubt regretting his decision to persuade the stable to sign @entity231 as he did so			0
earlier that decade , when one feuding @entity243 ( @entity245 's @entity244 ) had suggested to a team colleague ( @entity246 ) that they bury the hatchet , the @entity250 's reply -- " yeah , in your back " -- typified the emotions when rivalries run deep			0
they have of course spilled over into premeditated physical violence before , most notably when @entity212 figure skaters @entity257 and @entity259 clashed in 1994			2
three years on from winning medals as teammates at the world championships , @entity259 's bodyguard and ex-husband hired an assailant to break one of @entity257 's legs ahead of the 1994 @entity268 -- a feat @entity259 failed to achieve , even if he did inflict enough damage to ensure @entity257 withdrew from a tournament that @entity259 went on to win			2
despite denying any involvement , @entity259 was later stripped of her title and banned for life from participating in any further figure - skating events in the @entity212			2
amid all this dressing room tension as players try to be the main man and with enmity between teammates potentially sinking any team , @entity71 warns that strong friendships between players can also bring complications			0
" an element of closeness between players can become a problem for a manager in that they wo n't demand more from each other			0
you need to be very robust to be best mates with someone but give them a rollicking from time to time			2
" my experience suggests that players who are good mates will give each other a grilling , but they need to be better at their style of communication as this can create trouble			0
" the " @entity308 " , a current player who writes anonymously about life at the top of the @entity135 game , is in agreement , saying how he has played " in teams where it could be argued that some players were too close to each other and so were unable to really deliver a bollocking when the situation called for it			1
" behind the scenes with @entity314 and @entity315 @entity71 believes the individual nature of tennis , where players are so accustomed to winning and losing by themselves , enables them to deal with any hostility when playing doubles better than those who take part in team sports			1
but he does not discount the players ' strength of mind			0
" strong characters like @entity11 and @entity12 can deal with an intense rivalry but the less robust can not , " says @entity71			1
indeed , the @entity15 duo -- who had a grudging respect for one another -- were admirably successful in temporarily shelving their differences as they united to win gold for their nation			1
" because of our rivalry , we were not that close on a private level , " admits @entity12			1
" but the good thing was we both had one goal			0
we wanted to win that medal			1
" after we both lost in the singles , that was the only chance we had -- as a team			0
we wanted to win the medal so we had to do well in doubles and we were professional enough to just go on that path			1
