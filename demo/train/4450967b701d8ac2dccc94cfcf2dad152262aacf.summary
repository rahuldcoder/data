-- november 18 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 / @entity6 @entity7 , @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity15 , @entity16 : that paper airplane can only mean one thing : it 's time for a new edition of @entity0 ! @entity21 is at an anti-bullying conference this week			1
first up today , the halls of @entity26			1
first up : leaders in @entity26 @entity15 : the 112th @entity26 wo n't start until january , but it 's picking its leaders this week ! these are the men and women who will guide the members of their political parties			1
in the @entity34 , things will look very familiar			2
@entity36 senator @entity35 is the current @entity34 majority leader			2
he 'll hold onto that title			2
the @entity38 lost some seats in the midterms , but still have a majority			2
on the other side of the @entity34 aisle , @entity43 @entity42 , who is the current @entity34 minority leader , will continue on in that role			2
control of the @entity48 changed hands in the midterms ; the @entity43 will be in the majority when the new session starts			2
they unanimously picked representative @entity54 to continue as their leader			2
he 's now in line to be the new speaker of the @entity48			1
@entity38 voted for the current @entity48 speaker , @entity59 , to become the @entity48 minority leader			2
but not all of them			2
of the @entity38 who will be part of the next @entity26 , about 25 percent voted for someone other than @entity59 to be leader			1
security hearing @entity15 : that 's not the only thing @entity26 is doing this week			1
a @entity34 committee is talking with the head of the @entity70 about security checks at airports			2
this is something you 've been talking about on our blog : the advanced scanning machines and security checks			2
the holiday travel season is almost here , so this is getting a lot of attention			2
the question is , how do you find a balance between privacy and security ? sen. @entity86 , ( r ) @entity87 : i 'm , frankly , bothered by the level of these pat - downs			1
i 've seen them first hand in airports in @entity87			0
i also understand that you would like to do everything possible to keep @entity97 people safe , but there are limits			1
there has to be a balance here			0
what can we do to right this balance ? i think we 've gone too far afield			0
@entity105 , @entity70 administrator : we know that there are additional things that we could be doing to detect things			0
and we know , based on pat - downs and @entity110 , we have detected dozens and dozens of , let 's say , artfully concealed objects that could pose a risk to aviation			1
new @entity116 @entity15 : let 's talk about the economy for a second			1
experts look at a lot of things to figure out how it 's doing			1
that includes the stock market , unemployment numbers and the housing industry			0
a new report just came out about housing starts			0
that 's the number of new homes that are being built , and it 's down			1
during the month of october , housing starts dropped nearly 12 percent			0
in fact , they 're at their lowest level in 18 months			0
analysts expected the number to fall , but they were a little surprised by how much it dropped			0
@entity140 @entity141 , @entity16 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity144 's 6th grade humanities class at @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147 ! you 're looking at the island of @entity150			1
it 's made up of @entity6 and what other country ? is it : a ) @entity154 , b ) @entity5 , c ) @entity155 or @entity156 ) @entity157 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity6 takes up about one - third of @entity150 ; the @entity5 takes up the rest			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! protests in @entity6 @entity15 : the @entity5 is under a maximum health alert			1
we 've talked about the cholera outbreak that 's going on in @entity6			1
well , @entity5 authorities have been worried it might spread to their country , and it looks like it did			0
cholera does n't work like the cold or flu ; it usually does n't get passed from person to person			0
but officials say a @entity6 who works in the @entity5 brought the disease back over the border after he went home to @entity6 recently			1
he 's the first confirmed case of cholera in @entity150 's other nation			1
back in @entity6 , the cholera outbreak has led to violence in one town			1
we reported on that yesterday			0
@entity188 went there to check out the situation			0
( begin video ) @entity192 , @entity0 correspondent : roads leading into the city blocked by burning tires , torched cars and even a coffin			1
machete - wielding locals patrol the streets			0
scenes of chaos less than two weeks before @entity6 is supposed to hold presidential elections			1
we 've seen some crowds of young men out on the street			0
we 're told that they 're protesting against @entity209 peacekeepers			0
they want them to leave @entity6 and @entity212			1
they blame them for the cholera epidemic in this country			0
the peacekeepers can do little more for now than put out fires and face off against an angry population terrified by the deadliest cholera epidemic to hit @entity6 in more than half a century			1
@entity221 , taxi driver : we got so much people sick right now , so the people very , very , very , very scared about cholera right now			0
@entity192 : the @entity209 peacekeepers are effectively under siege , targeted by angry locals who almost went after us			0
the protesters are mostly armed with rocks and bottles			0
they clearly control most of the streets right now			0
as the sun set on a second day of riots , tear gas and smoke from dozens of fires continues to rise , over @entity6 's second largest city			1
( @entity240 ) @entity241 @entity15 : @entity241 : everyday people who are changing the world			0
tune in for the all - star tribute on @entity245 night			0
that 's one week from tonight			1
it airs at 8 p.m. @entity248 on @entity0			0
before that , head to @entity250 ; look for our spotlight section			0
you 're seeing that right here			0
that 's where you 'll find our @entity258			1
it has questions and activities that help students identify heroes in history and in their own lives			1
what 's the @entity267 ? @entity268 , @entity16 : what 's the @entity267 ? it 's an adjective that means relating to or about a city ; it 's also the opposite of rural urban that 's the word ! the @entity275 @entity15 : according to the @entity209 , more than half of the world 's population lives in urban areas			1
if you live in a city , you know there 's a lot going on , a lot to keep track of			1
what you might not know is that all of that could affect your brain			1
doctor @entity290 explains how and what you can do about it			0
( begin video ) @entity290 , @entity294 : life in the concrete jungle , that 's what they call it			1
and if you live in a city , you are probably used to something like this			1
problem is , with so many different distractions , it 's very hard to focus on one particular thing			1
it 's called controlled perception , toggling back and forth between so many things			1
and it can leave you feeling mentally exhausted			0
there 's no question that living in a city has a lot of advantages			1
shops are open all hours of the day , you can buy things , there are also lots of cultural attractions			0
but what we 're finding more and more is that all of that comes with a price			0
there 's an impact on the brain , as well			1
in fact , here in @entity8 , it 's a big topic of discussion			2
they are talking about the fact that mental illness is one of the biggest health problems here , and they attribute it to this complex , high - tech environment			0
the thing is , more people live in cities than ever before , and they are living in cities longer than ever			2
so , all of this is expected to get worse			0
and here 's why : all that stimulation , well , it can cause spikes to the stress hormone known as cortisol			2
and as a result , it can be very difficult for the brain to hold things in memory , reduces your self - control , dull your thinking , it may even speed up cognitive decline			2
just from living in a city			1
think of it as your brain more rapidly aging			2
but here 's the part i like in all this : getting away from the stress associated with the chaos in a big city can be as simple as finding a place like this			1
in fact , recent studies have shown that just glimpses of green areas can make a huge difference in your overall cognitive function			0
makes you less distracted , less stressed , and more relaxed			0
in fact , just a few minutes away from bustling @entity7 , @entity8 , we found this place : a very old park			0
a lot of people come here for a few minutes a day			0
there are shrines , and there are good opportunities to find green space , and that really seems to be the key : find green spaces in your city and make sure to use them as much as possible			1
( @entity240 ) before we go @entity15 : finally , have you ever sat in math class and wondered : when am i gon na use this ? well , this is when			0
check out this incredible video from @entity402			0
if she makes 128 shots in 60 seconds , how many shots does she make per second ? around two			0
let me say that again : she 's making two shots every second ! and in case you had n't noticed , she does n't miss a single one			2
you might call her a show off			0
goodbye @entity15 : we think she 's just a hot shot			2
here 's my question : since she 's doing this in an arcade , do you think she had to pay for the game , or did they give her a free throw ? you might call that pun a foul , but we 'll bounce right back with more tomorrow			2
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity24 .			0
