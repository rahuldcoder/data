-- @entity1 chose an auspicious moment to greenlight a @entity4 prequel show			1
the same day the network announced " @entity12 , " eternal rival @entity6 saw its multi-punctuated " @entity10 " spin - off " agents of @entity9 " deliver a dominant series - premiere ratings performance			1
" @entity9 's " success is proof - of - concept for a new @entity16 genre : a show set in a familiar super-universe that focuses on the less - super ( and decidedly cheaper ) heroes			2
" @entity12 " is superficially similar			1
like " @entity9 , " it transforms a supporting character into the lead : the show will apparently constitute an origin story for @entity26 , the chief lawman and friend - of - batman played by @entity28 in the " @entity30 " trilogy			1
but it also appears that " @entity12 " will prominently feature other characters from the comic book mythos			1
@entity1 has indicated that iconic villains will also appear , in some kind of fetal prequel form			1
expect to learn more about the show in tantalizing tidbits dropped with regular , @entity40 - imploding news releases over the next few months			0
in the meantime , here are five talking points about @entity12 : 1			1
it will probably have a strong narrative foundation from " @entity4 : @entity46			2
" although less famous than @entity48 's other grim - and - gritty ' 80s @entity4 adventure , @entity30 , @entity48 's four - part origin - story collaboration with artist @entity51 has arguably been more influential			1
@entity46 provided the structural backbone for @entity53 and strongly influenced the grounded portrayal of @entity55 through @entity57 's trilogy			0
the new series might be @entity4 - free , but @entity46 is just as much an origin story for @entity26			1
a younger @entity26 arrives in @entity12 as a @entity61 transplant with a pregnant wife and discovers the @entity12 police department is filled with corruption			1
he becomes a kind of @entity67 figure , a hero cop who refuses to take money ; meanwhile , his personal life falls into shambles			0
since @entity12 is on network tv , the rampant corruption will probably be toned down , but do n't be surprised if @entity26 becomes a great - at - his - job / bad - at - his - life procedural protagonist			1
it will hopefully have characters inspired by / taken directly from @entity78			0
this @entity82 / @entity81 / @entity80 monthly comic was short - lived but absolutely fantastic			0
essentially homicide : life on the street where the criminals are all costumed lunatics , @entity78 focused on the nitty - gritty police work performed by its gigantic cast of detectives			0
at one point , a @entity78 tv series was actually in development			0
( it was a long time ago ; the network developing it was the @entity95			0
) while @entity96 focused on the whole department , the new @entity12 will probably zero in on a squad of badasses — but if we 're lucky , some of those badasses will have names like @entity104 , @entity105 , and @entity106			2
it will almost certainly be a procedural			0
the new hot concept for a broadcast drama is a @entity111 drama set in a larger world that might eventually transform into something more ambitious			0
agents of @entity9 and @entity115 both had pilots that simultaneously set up long - running story arcs while promising hour - long monsters - of - the - week			0
@entity1 's own upcoming @entity119 could be a model for @entity12 : set in a fantastical world , but with weekly cases that mix the fantastical with viewer - grabbing cop work			1
@entity12 executive producer @entity124 created @entity125 , one of the more durable procedural concepts of recent years			2
i wonder if the first season will gradually build up through a series of cases that point to an ultimate villain , à la @entity131			0
but the show 's ambitions could grow , as it explores the history of @entity12			1
@entity4 's hometown has probably the most substantive history of any superhero city			2
over the years , various writers and projects have used @entity12 's dark - side - of - @entity141 persona as a chance to explore just about every bleak thing that has ever happened in the history of the @entity145			2
will @entity12 feature anything about the history of the @entity149 family ? or the tangled families of the @entity12 underworld ? could we ever get a trip to @entity154 , a prototype utopia fallen into disarray that appeared in @entity157 ? could season 5 of @entity12 just be a long @entity4 - free retelling of the incredible earthquake - apocalypse story arc of " @entity160 " ? remember : @entity124 also produced @entity161 , @entity163 's @entity162 , which constantly set its characters ' struggles against the history of their society			1
clearly , the @entity168 should be the @entity169			0
has any @entity4 villain had a rougher go of it in the modern era ? he 's the most famous bat - baddie to not get a @entity175 reinterpretation — which means that his most prominent appearance in the last two decades of pop culture was @entity179 's green - tights performance in @entity180			2
but the @entity168 could make for a great antagonist in a procedural : his whole existence is based around coming up with ever - more - elaborate mysteries			0
also , if the creators of @entity12 want to slowly back up into the crazier aspects of the @entity4 mythology — no @entity188 , no @entity189 — the @entity168 is a real - ish psychotic			1
they could even play around with the @entity168 's iconography : maybe , in this retelling , he 's @entity26 's main nemesis			2
or maybe he 's initially working with the @entity78 in some kind of expert capacity , like @entity195 in @entity195			0
come on guys , the @entity168 ! he makes riddles ! what do you want to see from @entity12 , fellow bat - people ? and who should play @entity26 ? @entity202 ? @entity203 ? @entity204 ? see the original story at @entity0			1
