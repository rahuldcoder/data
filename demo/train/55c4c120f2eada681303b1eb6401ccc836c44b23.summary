@entity0 , @entity1 -- they do n't call it being " sent to @entity5 " for nothing			0
we learned this on the first day of our trip to @entity10 , in the western part of this 5.1 million square - mile region of @entity13 , while filming a documentary about how and why the youth of this economically depressed city were in the death grip of a heroin epidemic			1
it 's a story squarely at odds with the rebranding of @entity13 youth as prosperous super humans living in a world of money , success and freedom			1
in reality , @entity13 now consumes 21 percent of the world 's heroin			1
and with a southern border more than 4,000 miles long , an area greater than the distance from @entity34 to @entity0 , it 's little wonder that @entity38 's attempts at interdiction have largely failed			0
a sense of @entity42 - era poverty pervades in @entity10 : the moldering grey housing blocks , the wake - up call of barking wild dogs , the 6 a.m. hotel breakfasts of @entity44 and hard - fried eggs speckled with dill			2

when researching the krokodil story , we heard grim tales of zombified addicts building @entity74 coffins to bury their friends , disfigured and brain - damaged ex-users , and religious cults disguised as rehab clinics			0
during a weeklong trip to @entity10 , we found all of this -- and more .			2
