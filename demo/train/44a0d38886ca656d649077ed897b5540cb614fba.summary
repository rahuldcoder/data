@entity1 's contentious and costly war in @entity2 officially ended thursday with an understated ceremony in @entity4 that contrasted sharply with its thundering start almost nine years ago			1
@entity1 troops lowered the flag of command that flew over the @entity2 capital , carefully rolled it and cased it in camouflage in accordance with @entity13 tradition			1
the quiet ceremony , under a bright @entity2 sun , was the opposite of the nighttime " shock and awe " bombardment of @entity4 that launched the war against @entity19 in march 2003			1
justified by president @entity21 on the grounds that @entity19 was seeking weapons of mass destruction that he could share with terrorists such as @entity26 , the invasion cased deep divisions in @entity1 and around the world			2
@entity30 photos : looking back at 8 years of war in @entity2 after that , men and women from @entity34 to @entity35 began crossing the border into @entity2 -- and began dying or coming home with lifelong injuries			1
@entity19 's regime proved easy to topple , but no weapons of mass destruction were found , and the @entity1 and its allies were left occupying a country where they were not greeted as liberators , despite the prediction of @entity21 's vice president , @entity48			2
@entity2 erupted into sectarian violence , leaving @entity1 troops to try to contain what threatened to become a civil war			1
improvised explosive device became a household term , traumatic brain injuries a signature wound of the war			0
defense secretary @entity57 , who flew into @entity4 for thursday 's flag - lowering ceremony , recalled that when he visited in 2006 as a member of @entity21 's @entity62 , " sectarian violence was skyrocketing , and it seemed as if nothing was working			1
" but , he said , " after a lot of blood spilled by @entity2 and @entity1 , the mission of an @entity2 that could govern and secure itself has become real			1
" on thursday , the @entity2 war officially ended as president @entity69 described it : not with a final battle but with a final march home for @entity1 troops			1
in all , the @entity1 spent more than $ 800 billion in @entity2			1
@entity57 reflected on a greater cost			2
he said the @entity1 was " deeply indebted " to all @entity1 in uniform			2
nearly 4,500 of them were killed in this war , more than 30,000 wounded			2
in their own words : eight lives changed by the @entity2 war and he hailed the advances made in @entity2 since @entity19 was ousted			1
" this is a time for @entity2 to look forward , " he said			2
" this is an opportunity for @entity2 to forge ahead on a path to security and prosperity			2
we owe it to all of the lives that were sacrificed in this war not to fail			0
" no one knows how many @entity2 have been killed since march 2003 , but the independent public database @entity93 has compiled reports of more than 150,000 between the invasion and october 2010 , with four out of five dead being civilians			1
thousands of other @entity2 struggle to cope with lives marred by war			2
for them , the battle goes on as the @entity1 leave behind a fragile nation struggling to establish democracy , struggling to establish stability			2
violence still claims innocent lives in @entity2			2
people are frustrated with the lack of electricity			0
@entity4 is awash in trash			0
no one can predict @entity2 's future without the presence of @entity1			1
" as long as there are assassinations and explosions from time to time in this country , then of course i have fears , " said ministry of transportation employee @entity113			0
" when i walk in a crowded street , i have concern of any sudden explosion			0
" student @entity127 said @entity2 was not prepared militarily or politically to handle challenges			0
but businessman @entity129 said " every beginning has an end			0
" " the political divisions are huge and no one knows what will happen after december 31 , " the date by which @entity1 troops must leave , said @entity2 journalist @entity134 , assistant editor - in - chief of @entity136 newspaper in @entity137			1
@entity141 on @entity2 's oil potential all @entity1 troops must be out of @entity2 by the end of this month after @entity145 and @entity4 failed to agree on terms under which they could remain			1
at the height of the war in 2007 , when @entity21 ordered a so - called surge , more than 170,000 @entity1 troops were stationed in @entity2 , living on more than 500 bases and outposts across the nation			1
as of tuesday , only 5,500 @entity1 troops remained			1
a senior defense official traveling with @entity57 said that some troops -- perhaps 3,000 to 4,000 -- will remain in @entity157 for a certain period of time but said the details have not been worked out with the @entity157			1
only half of @entity1 think their nation achieved its goals in @entity2 , according to a @entity30 / @entity165 poll conducted last month			1
still , 61 % favored the withdrawal of all troops by the end of the year			0
and 68 % said they opposed the war in @entity2			2
opinion : i 'm grateful my husband served in @entity174 , not @entity2 @entity2 , on the other hand , are worried that the @entity1 wants to disengage from their country entirely , @entity175 said , pointing out that @entity69 came to office partly on the strength of his opposition to the war and sent vice president @entity182 to visit recently rather than coming himself			1
but @entity183 , a former adviser to three @entity1 ambassadors , pointed out that @entity1 disengagement has been a process , rather than a sudden action			0
@entity2 , he said , has been in charge of its own security since 2009			0
" it 's not like we were controlling @entity2 's security situation last week , and now we 're suddenly leaving , " he said			0
" we have n't had troops in @entity4 for over two years			2
" gen. @entity194 , chairman of the @entity195 , explained in practical terms what the end of the @entity1 military mission meant			0
departing from his prepared text , he said he had been able to fly into @entity2 on this occasion simply because he wanted to do so			0
" the next time i come here , i 'm going to have to be invited by the @entity2 government , and i kind of like that , " @entity194 said before concluding his speech with thanks and a blessing in @entity205			0
secretary of state @entity209 said the @entity1 will help the people " realize their own ambitions for a free and sovereign @entity2			1
" it also will work closely with the @entity2 government to ensure the safety of @entity1 civilians staying in the country , she said			1
" i think it 's understood this is one of the most challenging missions that the @entity219 has ever led , but we 've had a great deal of thought given to what needs to be accomplished , " @entity216 said in @entity145			0
back home , many of those @entity1 who sacrificed in @entity2 harbor mixed feelings about the war			1
but if @entity2 can emerge as a free and democratic nation , every @entity1 soldier should feel proud , said retired @entity13 gen. @entity229			1
" if that 's the case , then these soldiers can say , yes , indeed , they won , " he said			0
" every soldier and their families should walk away extremely satisfied and proud of what they accomplished and what they left behind			0
i just hope it can remain that way			0
" @entity69 laid out that same message as he welcomed home returning troops wednesday at @entity243 , @entity244			0
" because of you , because you sacrificed so much for a people that you had never met , @entity2 have a chance to forge their own destiny , " @entity69 said			0
" that 's part of what makes us special as @entity1			0
unlike the empires of old , we did so not for territory or for resources			0
we do it because it 's right			0
@entity69 said there was no fuller expression of @entity1 support for self - determination than its withdrawal from @entity2			1
that , he said , speaks volumes for the @entity1 people .			0

@entity1 committed to assisting @entity2 , @entity216 says
