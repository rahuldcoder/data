@entity0 -- in the tunnels and caves that lie deep beneath @entity0 an elaborate , and , at times , dangerous game of cat and mouse is played out nearly every weekend			1
in this case the mice are represented by the cataphiles -- a group of dedicated hedonists who love to party in the abandoned quarries deep beneath the @entity15 capital - and the part of the cat is played by the police who patrol the places most people would fear to tread			1
@entity0 has two main underground attractions -- one being a vast catacomb which holds the remains of more than six million people , the other being a network of tunnels and quarries that stretch nearly 321 kilometres under the city			1
at the official catacombs visitors who are prepared to walk down the 139 steps and along endless tunnels are met by truly extraordinary sights as well as a fascinating slice of 18th - century life in @entity0			1
in 1786 the cemeteries of @entity0 were full to bursting , meaning corpses were often buried near those people still living			1
after the collapse of a communal grave near the center of the city it was decided to transfer all the bones to one vast ossuary			1
nowadays the mountains of unwanted bones have been arranged into a macabre set of alleys and pillars - a process that was started two centuries ago			0
one of the museum 's curators @entity55 told us how people usually reacted on their first visit : " when you come here for the first time you get quite destabilized but then you get used to it			0
there are so many bones here you do n't see them as human remains , you just see them as decorations			1
" our program was looking as all aspects of underground life in @entity0 and in the process of researching it we also came across another extraordinary group who put the subterranean spaces to new uses			1
@entity77 , @entity78 for short , is a highly secretive organization which has gained a cult following after successfully completing a series of high profile stunts deep under the city			1
members of @entity78 very rarely reveal what , how , or why they do what they do but @entity1 arranged a series of meetings with one of their members who slowly let us into some of the secrets			1
we first met @entity93 - not his real name but the one he insists on using -- in an anonymous @entity0 bar			1
with a shaved head and regulation black clothes he is a friendly , if somewhat cagey , individual			0
we wanted to know who the @entity78 were			1
his answer was suitably cryptic			0
" the @entity78 is a collective of people who pursue the same aim with a range of skills			2
it is anyone and everyone			0
there are no characteristics in terms of age , sex , social or cultural background -- the only characteristic is to live relatively close to the area where the projects are carried out , in @entity0			2
all the rules of the @entity78 have to do with feasibility -- the practical aspect of the execution of the projects			2
" the @entity123 - or more precisely one of quarries that lies beneath it -- was the scene of one their most infamous projects			0
the group - which has existed for 30 years -- dug deep under the theatre to create their own fully functioning cinema in one of the hundreds of caves under the city			1
they even made their own film to mark the event			0
over a beer @entity93 explains what motivates the ux			0
" we are a group who use public spaces , not necessarily the public spaces underground , not necessarily abandoned			0
it is simple - the only characteristic of the spaces we use is that they are public , and have been left , that 's to say " loosely " abandoned			0
the vocation of these spaces is to accommodate projects			0
" secrecy is , of course , essential for @entity93 and other members of the @entity78			2
" the secrecy is just linked to the feasibility			0
when we were young we profited from the craze of underground parties in the 1990s in the ancient quarries of the @entity160 in order to discover , that in fact there was all this public space , which was totally abandoned , which we could use for anything			2
much later , at the same time as wanting to learn more about all this public space , to have a geographic and practical knowledge - that is by getting hold of maps and keys to use the tunnels - we realized this really was the ideal location for numerous projects			0
" before we leave him @entity93 tells us that the @entity78 have several more projects in mind but , unsurprisingly perhaps , he declines to elaborate saying future plans have to be kept under wraps			2
living life in @entity0 ' empire of the dead			0

the catacombs of @entity0 contain millions of bones after cemeteries could no long accommodate burials
" @entity194 " love to explore the deserted tunnels and abandoned quarries under the city
@entity78 has completed a a series of high profile stunts deep under the city , *including* its own *fucntioning* cinema
