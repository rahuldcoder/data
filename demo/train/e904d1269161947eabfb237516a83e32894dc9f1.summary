@entity0 are going all in , hoping that the payout is big			1
like control of the @entity3 , big			0
their big bet : @entity5			1
the deadline to enroll in the @entity5 for the year has come and gone			1
the @entity8 administration is touting the enrollment numbers as a successful first year , but republicans think voter anger over the law is here to stay			1
and so , @entity0 running for @entity13 and @entity3 continue to make it central to their campaign			1
in the @entity3 race , @entity0 challenger @entity16 is using @entity5 to fund - raise for his race against @entity20 incumbent @entity19			1
the first screen on @entity16 's website is a plea for contributions that says , " @entity5 is so bad that @entity8 does n't want it			1
tell him neither do i. " fund - raising schemes and campaign advertisements are central to @entity0 races in red and swing states around the country			1
@entity0 confidence when @entity0 @entity34 beat democrat @entity35 in @entity37 's special election for the 13th @entity38 in march , @entity0 attributed the win in part to the health care law			1
" his ( @entity34 's ) victory shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of @entity5 , " @entity43 chairman @entity42 and co-chair @entity44 said in an email blast to reporters after the results were tallied			1
the deep - pocketed group @entity52 is playing in dozens of races around the country , and its sole weapon is @entity5			1
" we do want to make sure that @entity5 is the number one issue in the country , " @entity56 , president of @entity57 , said in a recent interview			1
the organization , backed by the wealthy partisans @entity34 and @entity64 , has already spent more than $ 30 million this election cycle and plans to spend a great deal more to ensure that @entity20 " have to explain " their support of the law			1
public opinion @entity0 believe they have a winning issue , insisting that @entity72 are opposed to the law			1
and most polling is on their side			0
according to the most recent survey conducted just over a week ago by @entity76 , 53 % of @entity72 gave the law a thumbs down , compared to 41 % saying they approve of it			0
that 's in line with most polls			2
but that could be starting to change			0
a @entity84 poll released last week found that the gap between approval and disapproval of the law narrowed to 8 points			0
and a new @entity92 / @entity91 poll out monday found that 49 % support the law compared to 48 % who do n't			0
public action while polls are indicative of voter opinion , they do n't indicate voter action			0
what does , however , is enthusiasm , and @entity0 have that on their side			1
in a midterm election , when people are less likely to vote , voter turnout is critical and @entity5 gives @entity0 an advantage			1
" this data pretty clearly shows that even though attitudes regarding the @entity5 are ' baked in ' with voters ( 68 % feel strongly one way or another about the issue ) , the intensity is clearly on the negative side , as @entity0 voters clearly dislike the new law more than @entity20 are in love with it , " said @entity0 pollster @entity108 , a co-founder of @entity109			1
voter apathy is a challenge that @entity20 must overcome			0
@entity0 strategy : invoke doubt @entity0 are hitting a nerve when it comes to @entity5			1
they are appealing to their base 's mistrust in the president			2
@entity0 sen. @entity131 on " @entity130 " alleged the administration is " cooking the books " regarding the program 's rollout numbers			1
this includes the latest number that more than 6 million have enrolled			0
and @entity0 constantly raise questions : who are the people enrolling and did they have health insurance beforehand ? @entity5 was pushed by the president and passed by @entity143 in 2010 with no @entity0 support as a way to narrow the gap between those with coverage and the tens of millions without it			1
@entity13 spokesperson @entity150 said @entity0 are grasping at straws as the law takes hold and people begin to see benefits			2
" i know it leaves them with the need to go back to the drawing board when it comes to other means of trying to attack a law that is providing opportunity and security to millions of @entity72 , " @entity150 said			0
@entity0 risks pounding an issue into the ground does bring some risks -- voter annoyance			1
a @entity84 poll found that 53 % of @entity72 are tired of hearing about the law			0
@entity0 pollster @entity171 said there 's a more powerful factor in voter fatigue : @entity8 himself			1
six years into a president 's term , " people get tired of that person 's leadership , " he said			2
" especially this president 's			2
" @entity20 ' challenge the goal is to get @entity20 to the polls			0
democrats , however , have a more complicated role that consists largely of defense			0
while they are being attacked on the campaign trail over the law , they have decided to respond in a multipart way by saying that some of the law is great , but some parts need to be fixed			2
that 's exactly what endangered @entity20 , including sens. @entity197 of @entity198 and @entity200 's @entity199 , did when they and several colleagues penned an op - ed laying out the parts of the law that they said need to be changed			2
rep. @entity207 , chairman of the @entity208 , an organization that works to elect @entity20 to @entity143 , is fighting back by highlighting the " cost of repeal			0
" the organization is telling stories of people who live in districts with contested congressional races who say they could not afford health coverage without the @entity5			2
" @entity72 do not want to repeal the @entity5 and go back to the days when insurance companies had free rein over health care ; they want it fixed and improved			2
but this @entity143 is obsessed with a repeal that will force hardworking families into bankruptcy and let insurance companies deny care and drop coverage , " @entity207 said			0
it 's a difficult way to convince people to turn out to vote , even if public opinion drastically changes in favor of the law			0
in the march @entity37 special election in a swing district in a swing state , the only test case analysts have to monitor in the current political climate , @entity35 embraced only parts of the law			1
she also talked about what needs to be fixed , a strategy that did n't work			0
but as of now , @entity20 do n't want to be talking about it			0
that 's why they are focusing on economic issues such as minimum wage and equal pay for women			0
@entity249 sen. @entity248 , who is a member of @entity3 @entity20 leadership , said people are n't focused on @entity5			2
" most @entity72 want to hear something positive			0
' what are you going to do for me ? ' republicans are going to give them no answers on that , " @entity248 said			0
but former president @entity259 said @entity20 cautioned against running from the law they championed and passed			0
" i thought that @entity20 had a tendency to shy away from things they had done that were unpopular , ( and ) talk about positions they had that were popular			0
and that my own experience had convinced me -- going back to ' 94 and even more when i was governor -- that that was always a terrible mistake , " @entity259 said this week			0
official : @entity5 on track to meet original goal five things polls tell us about @entity5			2

@entity5 enrollment deadline has passed
but @entity0 have embraced it as a campaign issue
what about the question of " @entity8 fatigue " for voters ?
@entity34 's win in @entity37 partly attributed to @entity287 sentiment
