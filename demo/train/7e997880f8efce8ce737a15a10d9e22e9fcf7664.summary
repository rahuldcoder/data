-- they said he was crazy			2
and he knew they were a little bit afraid			2
when a small @entity6 industrial town took in thousands of @entity8 immigrants , there were some concerns as to how it would work			1
the locals in @entity12 , located 200 km north of the capital , were already struggling with the economic realities of modern - day life			2
the arrival of 3,000 @entity17 would swell the population to almost 50,000 -- raising the type of fears that have become all too common across @entity21			1
last may @entity6 experienced its worst riots in years following the death of a 69 - year - old man who was shot by police earlier while wielding a machete in the @entity28 suburb of @entity29 , which has a large number of immigrant residents			1
but one man thought he had the answer			2
" i feared there would be problems with a lot of people coming from @entity17 to a little town , " says @entity12 resident @entity34			1
" that can make problems			0
i thought integration in sport was a good way to work			1
it 's something everyone has in common			0
if we could just do something that everybody could get together around , it would help			0
" i do think people in @entity12 were afraid as they 'd not seen that situation before			0
i think from the start very few people have been angry with me			0
there have been good vibrations			0
" football is often credited with bringing people together , a unifying force -- and indeed a game popular with the @entity17			1
but @entity34 had a better idea			0
why not get them to play the local game , @entity64 -- a close relative of ice hockey ? " people on the street said i was crazy , the manager said i was crazy , the people of @entity17 asked if i was crazy , the national @entity64 organization too			1
but we are nearly there now , " @entity34 told @entity0			0
he has managed to bring together a team of @entity17 football players , none of whom had ever skated on ice before , and take them to the @entity79 starting in @entity80 this weekend			1
" just being there is a victory whether we win , lose or draw , " says @entity81 , who plays in midfield			0
" ok , we want to score once but this is our victory			0
it will be amazing to play in our national colors , to hear our national anthem			1
" @entity81 , who moved to @entity6 five years ago , admits he was not well versed in snow or ice -- which is not surprising , having grown up in an east @entity8 country where the temperature gauge rarely drops below @entity94 ( @entity95 )			1
" really , i thought ice was just something you put in @entity100 , " he says , almost embarrassed by the recollection			1
@entity34 was well aware of the challenge he faced			0
the players , most of whom are 18 or 19 , were not exactly natural skaters			1
" i said to them they were like @entity108 on ice -- the problem was they had n't even heard of @entity108 , " he adds , laughing			2
for @entity81 , it is a welcome relief from the ordeal of living in his war - torn homeland			0
" life in @entity17 was awful and tough to handle , " he admits			1
" every day is like a new day in @entity17			1
" you do n't know what 's going to happen tomorrow or even in the next hour			0
it was a clash every day			0
there was war and between that you could still be shot			0
" my @entity124 took care of me , and she would keep me at home , but i have seen things			0
" i had a friend who was 10 years old when he was shot in the back , who just wanted to go to the football field			2
he made it , he did n't die , but it 's so hard for him now just to walk			2
people were just always running			0
" when not practicing his @entity64 playing two hours a day , the 19 - year - old is studying with the aim of becoming a doctor or architect			1
his father @entity141 also lives in @entity6 , while his mother has moved to @entity143			1
" initially my father saw the sport and said , ' you 're going to break your arm or leg , ' and he was right , " he says			0
" when i first skated i was terrible			0
there were children aged five on the ice better than me			2
i was thinking even if i ice - skate for six years i ca n't do this , i spent so much time falling over			2
" those first tentative , @entity108 - like steps took place just six months ago and now his father 's perceptions have changed			2
" he 's ok now , he 's happy , " says @entity81			0
the @entity17 players have finally found the target , scoring their first goals in training this week			1
how the journey ends remains to be seen , but a film is being made of their passage from @entity17 to @entity166			1
a @entity168 ending seems unlikely , though that is hardly the point			0
" we want to show the world that everything is possible , " @entity81 says			0
coached by @entity175 , who won five world titles playing for @entity6 , the @entity17 team will take on @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 in the tournament , which starts in the @entity166 city of @entity183 on sunday			1
local @entity12 band @entity184 even recorded a @entity185 for the town 's adopted team			1
@entity17 's entry is a contest that makes @entity190 versus @entity191 look like a fair fight , as the novices take on the powerhouses of a sport played between two teams of 11 on an ice rink the size of a football field , using hockey sticks and an orange ball			1
" i 'm so nervous just to think about it because i never imagined this would be possible , " @entity81 says			0
" i dreamed one day to be a world champion but i never had anything but football			2
when i was first told about this , i was like , ' is this serious or a joke ? ' but it 's now real			0
" it has made us so proud			2
i explain it to my family and friends in @entity17			1
they do n't understand @entity64 completely but they are so proud of us , the country is proud of us			1
