@entity0 -- former president @entity3 left the hospital friday morning after doctors performed a procedure to restore blood flow in one of his coronary arteries , longtime friend @entity2 told @entity1			1
@entity3 , 63 , was hospitalized at @entity12 's @entity11 campus after experiencing brief periods of discomfort in his chest over several days , according to dr. @entity16 , the hospital 's chief of cardiology			1
two stents were used to restore blood flow to a coronary artery thursday after images revealed that a bypass graft -- part of a quadruple bypass surgery that @entity3 underwent in 2004 -- was blocked , @entity16 said			1
an electrocardiogram and a blood test showed no evidence of a heart attack , @entity16 said			0
" if i know @entity3 , he 's going to get right back on the phone , " @entity2 , a former chairman of the @entity30 , told @entity1 on friday			1
" yesterday as they were wheeling him into the operating room , they literally had to take the phone out of his hand as they were wheeling him in to surgery			2
" he was on a conference call dealing with @entity40			0
and i guarantee you as soon as he gets back today he 'll be back on the phone			0
" @entity16 said the need for the procedure had nothing to do with @entity3 's post-bypass diet or exercise , which @entity16 called excellent			1
rather , @entity16 said , this is " part of the natural history " of the bypass treatment			0
" he really toed the line in terms of diet and exercise			0
he really followed the program , " @entity16 said , adding he told @entity3 that he 'd be allowed to return to work monday			1
the stents have opened the artery that the blocked bypass graft was supposed to service , @entity16 said			1
stents are tiny balloons that are threaded into a patient 's heart vessels where they are inflated , pushing plaque against the vessel wall and increasing blood flow			0
the graft 's blockage is n't unheard of , because that particular type of graft has a 10 percent to 20 percent failure rate after six years , @entity16 said			2
however , a bypass graft at a different artery -- the main artery in the front of @entity3 's heart -- still looks " pristine , " @entity16 said			1
" we know from multiple studies that if that bypass is open at this point ... it will remain open , " he said			0
stents and chest pain explained @entity16 said @entity3 was up and walking about two hours after thursday 's procedure			1
in a written statement , @entity85 , counselor to the former president , said : " president @entity3 is in good spirits and will continue to focus on the work of his foundation and @entity40 's relief and long - term recovery efforts			1
" @entity3 's daughter , @entity94 , and wife , secretary of state @entity96 , were with him at the hospital thursday night , @entity16 said			1
@entity96 was scheduled to leave friday on a planned trip to the @entity101 , but her departure has been delayed until saturday , a senior @entity99 official said			0
@entity3 has n't left the public eye since he departed the @entity104 in 2001 , maintaining an active schedule devoted to global philanthropic interests and speeches			2
since the january 12 earthquake that hit @entity40 , he has traveled there twice in his latest role as the @entity112 special envoy			0
on february 3 , @entity112 @entity113 ban ki - moon placed @entity3 in charge of overseeing aid and reconstruction efforts there			2
@entity3 also attended the @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity120 , in january			2
@entity121 , @entity1 senior political analyst , said @entity3 was " exhausted " and had a cold after returning from his second trip to @entity40 earlier this month			2
@entity3 had busy schedule before heart procedure @entity3 's 2004 surgery was performed at the same hospital where he was admitted thursday			1
doctors in 2005 operated again on @entity3 to remove scar tissue and fluid that had built up after his bypass surgery			1
dr. @entity132 , president of @entity133 's @entity134 and @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137 , rejected as outdated suggestions that @entity3 needs to slow down			1
" this is kind of a ' 50s concept , " he told @entity1 in a telephone interview thursday			0
" now , we 've got a lot of fantastic ways to prevent progression of heart disease -- medications , things that can be done			0
the outlook for people is totally different			0
" " if he slows down , he slows down , " said @entity132 , who who has not treated @entity3			2
but , he added , " it would be very hard to show any data that would tell you he 'll have more trouble if he hangs it up			0
" @entity132 said thursday 's stenting procedure may not be the end of @entity3 's heart woes			1
" the problem there is that that vein graft is developing disease and sometimes it goes on and develops more , " he said			0
" there 's a substantial chance over the next three , four , five years that it could close up again			0
" @entity1 's @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
