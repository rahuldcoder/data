-- the @entity2 city of @entity3 exploded into chaos early thursday morning as gunmen launched a series of attacks across the country 's commercial capital , killing scores of people and taking hostages in two luxury hotels frequented by @entity14			1
@entity0 's @entity15 says @entity2 and @entity16 might be warming toward each other			1
chief international correspondent @entity15 spoke about the situation			1
@entity0 : an attack this large , this sophisticated , and carried out with no warning could have come from inside @entity2 , maybe , maybe outside , maybe a neighboring state could be involved			1
what do you hear ? @entity15 : well , @entity27 , @entity26 militants have been stepping up their assaults on @entity3 , which is not just the center of its filmmaking , but the economic and financial hub of @entity2			1
they have often blamed terror attacks on @entity26 militants based in @entity16			1
some , they say , are concerned about , for instance , @entity2 rule over @entity37			1
@entity38 also has threatened to attack @entity2 in revenge for its policies			1
very , very interestingly , this comes at a time when the new president of @entity16 has , in fact , gone further than any previous @entity16 leader in saying they want to improve relations with @entity2 , in saying they want to jointly combat terrorism together			1
the @entity16 president even went so far as saying he would consider renouncing a nuclear strike on @entity2			1
this is a very confused situation			0
although some group has claimed responsibility , nobody knows the motive yet			0
... @entity0 : talk to me about why it would be in the interest of these people to sever this tie between @entity16 and @entity2			1
do they believe @entity2 would join in the effort to squeeze them out ? @entity15 : this is the ongoing situation			1
certainly , @entity37 is a flashpoint for @entity2 and @entity16 , and really back in 2006 , there were @entity26 militants blamed for recent attacks			1
about 180 people were killed there			0
the one that came closest to pitting @entity2 against @entity16 was in 2001 , when @entity26 militants attacked the @entity73			1
only 12 people were killed , but not compared to what 's happened now , and that almost led to a war between @entity2 and @entity16			1
whatever happens in this region is so , so difficult and dangerous because of the flash point it centers on			0
as i say , though it has come at a time right in the aftermath of the warmest outreach by @entity16 to @entity2 in decades			1
... @entity0 : what is , in all of this world picture , @entity15 , what is the significance of this ? @entity15 : well , this is deeply significant , obviously , because it is such a complex and coordinated attack on multitudinous targets , multitudinous locations			1
obviously , a large number of militants or terrorists who have taken part in this , and they have engaged the @entity2 forces , the police and security forces			1
it 's not like they just put bombs somewhere and allowed them to go off , and either they were suicide attackers who got killed or they were able to remotely detonate their bombs			0
what they 've done is not just attack , take hostages , but engage also with the security forces			0
so this really ratchets it up a very significant level			0
and it 's been coming for about 20 years , these attacks			0
@entity119 in the last couple of decades , but in the last 10 years or so , particularly since 9/11 , there have been a number of very significant attacks blamed by the @entity2 forces on @entity26 militants			2
... this is very , very dangerous in this part of the world			0
@entity3 is @entity2 's not just gateway to the nation ; it 's its economic and financial hub , and it 's its cultural hub as well , having the @entity131 and the other film production studios there			2
nobody quite knows who it is and why they have done it			0
this is the thing that is very difficult and dangerous at the moment			0
this little - known group , if it 's true that they exist , have claimed responsibility , although that has not been confirmed , so - called @entity147 , and what is the motive ? there has obviously for many , many years been a type of feelings by @entity2 that , say , 150 or so million @entity153 who are in the minority are feeling sort of hard done by in terms of the @entity157 majority			2
there are also complaints by @entity153 about the way @entity37 is progressing , that enclave , and that is a huge , huge flashpoint			1
but what 's really amazing is that often , it 's blamed on tensions with @entity16			2
and yet , this comes at a time where the president of @entity16 has -- the new president -- has really made an unprecedented overture to @entity2 in terms of trying to warm up relations , trying to secure a lasting peace			1
and just today , @entity2 and @entity16 officials were having meetings , and they ended it with a joint declaration that they wanted to cooperate on ending terrorism and combating terrorism			1
@entity0 : @entity15 , do you see any connection with the recent @entity184 elections and this ? @entity15 : well , it 's hard to tell			2
people would say that it takes a lot longer than a few weeks to plan something like this			0
it 's difficult to tell			0
i 'm sure there will be a huge amount of analysis in the upcoming days and weeks			0
what is going to be vital is whatever information the @entity2 security forces can get from some of these terrorists , militants , who 've apparently some may have been captured alive			2
obviously , there apparently have been some who have been killed as well			0
all of this will provide some of those missing pieces of the puzzle			0
who are these people ? what is their motive ? just today , there is an interview with the @entity215 commandant as basically saying that @entity38 's focus now is @entity16			2
there had been some thought that maybe @entity38 was in the past trying to launch its attacks also in @entity2 , but the @entity2 secret services and the security services say that they do n't have a presence there			2
but @entity16 is a very , very big worry			2
it 's a failing state			0
@entity224 is practically a failed state right now , even after the @entity184 in 2001 sent @entity38 and the @entity227 packing			0
there 's a very difficult and dangerous situation on this subcontinent that really has been the focus of a lot of attention right now , and indeed , the incoming president has said that he wants to step up the number of @entity184 forces			0
@entity184 commanders want more forces in that region as well , not just @entity224 , but to cope with @entity16 as well			1
@entity0 : as you said , there have been a lot of incidents since the year 2000 in @entity2			2
why is this one getting so much particular attention ? there was one with over 200 deaths			0
@entity15 : well , about 180 in 2006			2
but those were sort of multiple bombings in trains and railway stations			0
but this is one night with , so far , according to our sources , at least 87 people killed , and it 's a brazen attack on the most visible elements and symbols and structures of the economic , the cultural , the tourist , the international hub , as i said , the gateway to @entity2 -- which is the world 's largest democracy -- which is not a failed state by any stretch of the imagination			0
which has a unified political structure , which has an army and security forces			0
@entity2 is not @entity16 or @entity224 , and yet this has been able to happen here			1
and why is it getting so much attention ? because so many more people than ever before have been killed in one fell swoop , and it 's ongoing , and these people launched pitched battles with the security forces , and they still have hostages , and it appears they deliberately targeted @entity14 .			0

@entity16 leader has gone far in reaching out to @entity2 , @entity15 says
@entity285 may even join together to fight terrorism , correspondent says
