-- @entity2 's @entity1 hit the heights earlier this year when she made it to the semifinals of the @entity6 , beating @entity7 along the way			1
" i was so excited after i beat @entity7 [ @entity7 ] , because i knew this was a special day ... and for @entity2 tennis because they had two players in the semi-final			1
i mean , that 's not easy for @entity16 countries , " she told @entity0			0
@entity1 and her compatriot @entity17 , who also reached the @entity6 semifinals this year , have given the profile of @entity2 tennis a boost			1
but @entity1 , @entity2 's first tennis player to break into the top 10 world rankings , actually quit the game at the end of 2002			1
" i was feeling really sick , everyday			0
i did n't want to kill my body			0
i mean , i have a long life , i do n't want it to be only for tennis , " she said			0
she was first brought back to the game by a call to play in the @entity2 national championships and then returned to the @entity33 in 2004			1
" when i was young [ the @entity2 tennis authorities ] paid a lot of money for me to play in tournaments and do everything for me , so if now they need help i have to give back to them , " she said			1
" the plan was to finish university by 2005 and then finally get some sort of job for life			0
but after 2005 my ranking was 33 in the world and i thought ' @entity49 , what is going on ? i have to continue to play			0
" ' compared to the more demure @entity17 , she 's been portrayed as a rebel , sporting a tattoo and once telling @entity2 fans to shut up during her semifinal match against @entity55 in the @entity56			1
" they kept yelling , ' kill her ! ' with every shot ... i mean the fans are not bad , i know they just really wanted me to win the match			0
but maybe next time i will have more experience			0
i will just keep asking them to be quiet please ! " she also made the decision to leave @entity2 's state tennis system after the @entity56			1
until then she had to give 65 percent of her winnings to the @entity2 government			2
today , operating outside of the state system , @entity1 still has to give 12 percent of the winning to the government			2
" the @entity2 way is different from the @entity72 way , because our government gives you a lot of help and just asks back a little bit ... if someone helps you and you never give back , i 'd think they did n't want to be friends with me , " she explained			2
@entity1 is hopeful that other @entity2 players will follow in her footsteps , although it may be a long wait for a @entity2 man to emulate her @entity86 tournament performances			1
" i believe that in five year for sure , there will be a @entity2 guy coming into the @entity89			2
they are working so hard			0
in winter training i was with the national team , so i saw a lot of good players among juniors -- young girls and boys			0
so i was feeling ' yeah , after three years maybe @entity2 will be like @entity97 or @entity98 ' -- they have many people coming to play in tournaments , " she said .			2
