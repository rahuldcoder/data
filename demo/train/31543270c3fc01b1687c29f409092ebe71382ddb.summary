-- we were in touch two weeks ago ; @entity3 was my friend for more than 40 years , and toward the end of march he took it upon himself to send out one of my @entity0 columns to his more than 800,000 @entity10 followers , and i thanked him for his graciousness and generosity , which were constant			1
and then , wednesday , after he had publicly announced that he would be cutting back on his movie reviews as he battled the cancer that would not let up , i wrote him again to say some personal things			2
we could no longer have regular conversations , of course , because the cancer surgeries had cost him his speaking voice , but the e-mails oddly became more intimate than all the words we said out loud over all the decades			2
he did n't answer wednesday 's note , which was highly unusual			2
i wish you could have known him as a young man -- his laughter , his stories , his sheer joy of being out around other newspaper people			2
you know how well he wrote -- i wish you could have seen how fast he wrote			2
it was the sound of a machine gun , on those old manual typewriters			2
no one writes that fast -- and then , to have the result be so beautiful ? @entity3 was still drinking in those days , and there would be nights on @entity37 in @entity38 when the bars would close at 4 a.m. , and a group of us would come walking out , and rumbling down the street would be a @entity44 delivery truck			1
we all knew the drivers by name , and they knew us , and they 'd stop and invite us to hop in -- they 'd give us a ride home while dropping bundles of papers off before dawn			2
so there we 'd be , in those boxy red delivery trucks , and in the back would be the new editions , right off the press , sometimes still warm and damp			2
there were nights when @entity3 would pull the top copy off a bundle , and , right there in the truck , he would read the words of the review he had finished writing just hours before ... oh , he seemed so happy on those nights			1
opinion : what the @entity68 owes @entity3 for several @entity70 , we 've had a tradition			1
a couple of @entity74 ago , on christmas day , i took a walk around the downtown area of @entity38 , the streets and sidewalks slick with ice and snow			1
there is a statue , near the @entity83 , of @entity84 , the late longtime columnist for the @entity44			0
the statue was coated with snow			0
i snapped a photo of it and sent it to @entity3			1
i told him i was sending it in remembrance of all the @entity91 when we would be working in the fourth floor newsroom of the old @entity94 at 401 n. @entity95 , and @entity84 would come walking in , snow on his overcoat , on the beat as always , holiday or no. @entity3 wrote back with three words : " @entity103 's right , @entity101 ! " i laughed out loud , and i knew that @entity3 , if he could , would be laughing , too			1
@entity84 used to do the @entity105 broadcasts of @entity107 games with play - by - play man @entity108			0
whatever @entity108 might say about a play -- a touchdown , a great tackle , an interception -- kup could be counted on to reply with : " @entity103 's right , @entity101 ! " and so it was on @entity91 , right up to and including the last one			1
i 'd once again send that picture of the @entity84 statue to @entity3 , and his " @entity103 's right , @entity101 ! " would come back like clockwork			1
it was @entity3 who called me one day in 1999 , his voice shaking and mournful , to tell me the news that our mutual friend and @entity3 's television partner , critic @entity124 , had just died			1
the courage @entity3 has shown these last years as he has fought his own illnesses -- you can read the details of what he went through in the formal obituaries			1
a man whose voice was so famous , who loved so much to tell stories : to have that stolen from him -- yet to persevere with such humor and intelligence and basic good - guyness ... @entity3 kept us entertained at the movies i was in @entity38 for a few days last week			1
i knew that these recent months had been very difficult for him			0
on @entity138 , i saw the big , bright vertical sign for the old @entity140			0
the theater is gone and there 's a new and glitzy steakhouse in the building			2
in 1971 , in that newsroom at 401 n. @entity146 , @entity3 walked over and handed me the dupes -- the carbons -- of a review he had just written			1
it was for a film that was opening that week : " @entity152			0
" the dupes were light green and flimsy , the letters from that @entity157 - gun typewriter of his black and distinct			0
he told me he thought i 'd love the movie			0
so , on that day more than 40 years ago , i went to the @entity140 and saw it			1
last week , seeing the @entity140 sign , i walked into the new steakhouse			0
i wanted to offer @entity3 a silent toast			1
i rode an escalator upstairs			0
right around where i think the projection booth must have been , there was a bar			0
i took a seat and ordered something			0
there is some dialogue in " @entity152 , " very near the end			0
@entity173 , the rough - hewn soul of the town , has died , and the woman to whom he turned over the movie theater he owned is lamenting the fact that she is going to have to close it down			0
@entity3 in his own words she says to the two boys who have shown up on that final night : " nobody wants to come to shows no more			1
kid baseball in the summer , television all the time			0
@entity188 had lived , i believe we could 've kept it going			0
but i just did n't have the know - how			0
" and then had come the words : " wo n't be much to do in town , with the picture show closed			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			1

@entity197 , friend of @entity3 's for more than 40 years , laments his passing
he says @entity3 was amazing as a young @entity38 *journalist* . they shared great times
he says @entity3 persevered with humor and intelligence through his illness
