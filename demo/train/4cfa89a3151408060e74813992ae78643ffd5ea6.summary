@entity0 -- when the @entity3 decided to keep track of those @entity6 members on both sides of the aisle who voted to hold attorney general @entity10 in contempt of @entity12 last week , it was also sending a message to a number of embattled @entity16 congressmen seeking re-election in conservative districts in the fall			1
the message : vote right , or we 'll let your constituents know			0
though some @entity26 say the @entity3 did little to influence their vote , for a handful of those in the @entity6 , the message may have been received loud and clear , experts say			1
a @entity1 analysis showed that of the 21 democrats who voted to hold @entity10 in civil contempt of @entity12 last week over documents relating to @entity35 , 19 received campaign contributions from the @entity3 during the last two election cycles			1
the truth about the @entity35 scandal during that period , all of the 21 were targeted by the @entity42 , signaling the organization 's desire to turn the competitive districts from blue to red			1
and of the 17 democrats who voted in favor of criminal contempt thursday , all received campaign contributions from the @entity3 during the same time and have faced similar @entity55 campaign committee threats			1
one @entity56 who voted for the contempt charges said he did so on principle , not politics			1
" the attorney general was asked to provide information , and he chose not to provide			0
so as a result , i had no other choice but to vote in contempt , " @entity56 and @entity63 rep. @entity62 told @entity1 's @entity64			2
still , in this year 's ultracompetitive seats -- particularly those that have been subject to redistricting -- a nod from the @entity3 for a @entity56 could make the difference between re-election and retirement			2
the @entity3 raised the stakes of the vote for members in competitive districts when the organization announced that it would score the vote -- or publicly count any vote against holding @entity10 in contempt as a mark against a lawmaker seeking re-election			1
out of those seeking re-election who voted in favor of contempt , more than half are listed in competitive districts by the @entity88 and rely on conservative support , including endorsements from the @entity3 , to survive their tough political battles			1
efforts to seek comment from the @entity3 were not successful			2
of the 26 @entity56 members in the @entity6 who received money from the @entity3 in 2012 , the 12 who abstained or voted against contempt do not have notably competitive races , a @entity1 analysis found			1
" ( the contempt vote ) is a fairly low - cost way to demonstrate independence from your own party			1
the vote was going to pass anyway , so why not take the opportunity to say you can buck your own party , " said @entity104 , @entity6 race editor at the @entity105			2
no criminal prosecution of @entity10 for contempt " democrats in those types of districts love to have an @entity3 endorsement because it bolsters their standing with a demographic they need to cut into to survive , " @entity111 said			1
among them is rep. @entity120 , @entity121 , who is facing perhaps the toughest re-election campaign out of the 435 @entity6 seats up for election come november			2
@entity120 , one of the few white @entity26 left , found himself in a more conservative district after the @entity125 completed a controversial congressional redistricting process last year that left 12 @entity16 seats more uncertain than they were last election			2
in addition to the @entity3 's influential endorsement listed on his website , @entity120 received $ 9,900 in 2010 and $ 4,000 this year in pac - to - pac contributions from the gun rights organization			1
the 26 democrats to whom the organization contributed during the 2012 election cycle have received an average of about $ 2,100 , totaling $ 54,450 , according figures collected by the @entity141			2
@entity120 declined a request for comment but released a statement before the vote depoliticizing his support			0
" for me , this investigation has been about justice for @entity149 agent @entity35 and his family , " @entity120 said			0
" the only way to get to the bottom of what happened is for the @entity154 to turn over the remaining documents , so that we can work together to ensure this tragedy never happens again			0
" there is no doubt that @entity160 is a @entity55 target			0
@entity35 investigation started with agent 's death " it 's pretty clear ... that these @entity26 are going to do everything they can between now and november to distance themselves from the administration and the unpopular agenda , " @entity42 press secretary @entity165 said			2
@entity16 leaders , meanwhile , are n't standing still			0
the @entity171 launched monday a campaign of its own to target @entity6 @entity55 in key races this fall , highlighting their votes against health care reform			2
they will unleash a torrent of live and robo - calls , hitting 10 @entity6 races where they perceive vulnerability â € ” including rep. @entity181 and rep. @entity182 of @entity183 , rep. @entity184 of @entity185 and rep. @entity186 of @entity187			0
and all 10 voted to hold @entity10 in contempt			1
for four - term congressman @entity62 , he said he was being consistent in his vote against @entity10 , using the same strategy he touted during the 2010 election and in campaign ads. " too many people in @entity12 just tote the party line			1
@entity62 is n't like that			0
" no doubt about it			0
you saw he voted against health care			0
@entity62 opposed the @entity203 bailout			0
i think @entity62 is not afraid to stand up to the president			0
he fights for folks here , " the ad continued			0
@entity62 , who lost a primary battle to colleague rep. @entity211 after redistricting landed the pair in the same district , told @entity64 that he voted in favor of contempt because it was consistent with his vote to hold @entity221 administration @entity220 counsel @entity219 in contempt in 2008			1
@entity219 refused to show up for a congressional subpoena or to hand over documents relating to the firing of a large number of @entity228 attorneys			0
" i do n't like to play those kind of political games			0
i stayed consistent with the vote i cast in 2008			0
" approximately half of the @entity26 who voted in favor of contempt also voted against health care reform , including @entity160 ; rep. @entity236 , @entity237 ; rep. @entity238 , @entity239 - @entity240 ; rep. @entity241 , @entity242 ; rep. @entity243 , @entity239 - @entity240 ; rep. @entity244 , @entity245 ; and rep. @entity246 , @entity247			1
" in some cases , it 's a heartfelt vote , but in most cases , it 's political survival , " @entity111 said of the votes embattled lawmakers make across the aisle			1
opinion : holder contempt vote sign of ' broken ' @entity0 ?			0
