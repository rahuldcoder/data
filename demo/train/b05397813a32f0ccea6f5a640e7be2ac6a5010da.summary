@entity0 -- @entity3 will never stop its annual hunt for whales , a government minister has reportedly said , amid recent clashes on the high seas between environmental activists and @entity3 whaling ships			1
" i do n't think there will be any kind of an end for whaling by @entity3 , " @entity10 , the @entity3 minister for agriculture , forestry and fisheries , said in an interview with the @entity15 news service @entity14 on tuesday			1
his comments came after a @entity22 judge described @entity23 , the conservationist group that has sought to physically block the @entity3 whale hunts , as " pirates			1
" arguing that @entity3 has " a long tradition and culture of whaling , " @entity10 , the secretary - general of a pro-whaling group in the governing @entity27 , pointed out other countries ' eating habits that may not have universal approval			1
" in some countries they eat dogs , like @entity37			0
in @entity40 they eat kangaroos , " he was cited as saying			0
" we do n't eat those animals , but we do n't stop them from doing that because we understand that 's their culture			0
" the @entity3 @entity47 confirmed that @entity10 gave the interview to @entity14 on tuesday , but it declined to comment on the content of the article			2
recent clashes the interview took place the same week that @entity23 and @entity3 whaling authorities reported fresh clashes in @entity56 waters , with each side accusing the other of causing dangerous collisions between ships			1
@entity3 's @entity61 ( @entity61 ) -- which conducts whaling activities under the authority of the @entity47 -- accused @entity23 ships of " sabotage , " saying they rammed into a @entity3 whaling vessel while it was trying to refuel on monday			1
but @entity23 's @entity40 division countered with a different version of events , saying that the @entity3 ship had caused the collisions			2
the two sides had exchanged angry claims about a previous clash last week , all part of drama that plays out each year in the chilly @entity56 waters			1

environmental groups such as @entity23 face off with the @entity3 hunters , an approach that has resulted in collisions of ships , the detaining of activists and smoke bombs fired back and forth between the groups			1
legal battles @entity23 says the @entity3 ships have intruded into @entity40 territorial waters and breached international and @entity40 law			2
the @entity40 government has been one of the most vocal critics of @entity3 whaling and is currently pursuing international legal action to try to stop the hunting			2
but the @entity61 says its ships ' activities are perfectly legal , noting that a @entity22 court has banned @entity23 from threatening whaling ships ' operations or sailing within 500 yards of them			0
a @entity22 judge in @entity114 used strong words in a ruling monday that overturned a previous decision from a district court that had denied an injunction requested by the @entity61 and its claims of piracy against @entity122 - based @entity23			1
" you do n't need a peg leg or an eye patch , " chief judge @entity123 of the @entity124 said in his opinion			0
" when you ram ships ; hurl glass containers of acid ; drag metal - reinforced ropes in the water to damage propellers and rudders ; launch smoke bombs and flares with hooks ; and point high - powered lasers at other ships , you are , without a doubt , a pirate , no matter how high - minded you believe your purpose to be , " the judge said			0
all of those acts , according to @entity123 , are part of @entity23 's tactics			0
he said the @entity61 has a permit issued by @entity3 under the @entity150 and noted that " neither the @entity22 nor @entity3 recognizes @entity40 's jurisdiction over any portion of the @entity153			2
" @entity1 's @entity155 in @entity154 contributed to this report .			0
