-- youngster @entity1 claimed the eighth stage of the @entity3 as @entity4 retained his overall lead for @entity6			1
@entity1 , from @entity7 , is the @entity3 's youngest rider at 22 and held on after hitting the front with 2km to go , despite the overall leaders desperately trying to hunt him down			1
though @entity10 finished second to @entity12 's @entity11 , he was n't able to shave off any of @entity14 's lead as the @entity15 preserved his ten second advantage			1
the stage was punctuated with another nasty crash as @entity22 's @entity21 road race champion @entity19 came off his bike , suffering head and shoulder injuries that might prevent him from competing at @entity27			2
" it 's a dream come true , " @entity1 told reporters , of his maiden stage win on what is his debut @entity3			1
" i just did the longest 10km of my life , i 'll never forget it			0
i was quite scared when i heard the peloton had closed the gap to 50 seconds			2
" but a lot of this is down to @entity39 ( @entity40 )			0
he did a lot of the preparation work for me , i ca n't thank him enough			0
" after saturday 's strong performance from @entity6 , which saw @entity44 take the yellow jersey and teammate @entity47 win the stage , @entity44 survived a late attack on his lead			1
@entity10 , riding for the @entity52 team , and @entity54 @entity53 , of @entity55 , cranked up the pressure in the final stages but @entity44 did enough to record the same time and keep his nose in front			1
and with monday presenting the first of two individual time trials in a 41.5km stage from @entity64 to @entity65 , @entity44 has the chance to put more distance between himself and the chasing pack			2
but the 32 - year - old said : " there is so much fuss made about them , but there 's been another eight stages before then			0
you do n't win the tour on time trials alone			0
" it 's the race of truth , so you 've got to have the legs ultimately			0
i try not to think too negatively , and just concentrate on my own race			0
