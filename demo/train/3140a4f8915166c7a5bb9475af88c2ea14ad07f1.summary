-- @entity1 is not your typical comedian			1
the 42 - year - old is a 6 foot tall woman who snowboards , camps , raps about her lack of a rear end , and ca n't dance			2
" i will never be the lead in step it up 17 : old lady gets to @entity12 ' , " she writes in her new book			1
" i have made my peace with this			2
" while she might lack rhythm , the @entity16 grad speaks fluent @entity18 , with some functionality in @entity20 and @entity21			2
@entity22 was the first black recurring character on friends , has filled in for the late movie critic @entity24 and taken on gamers who questioned her nerd status			1
a few funny things happened on the way to the @entity30 finding success as @entity32 in the edgy animated fx series " @entity34 , " and hosting " @entity35 " , and the @entity38 's " who 's line is it anyway ? "			1
she ( regrettably ) wore two - toned hair and a see - through dress on the red carpet , survived throwing up on a guy during their first date , and bombed countless times on stage			1
in " @entity49 , " her second book , @entity22 argues that the path to success is paved with epic failures			1
and she 's not afraid to share her own hard - luck stories for a laugh or to show that fear of striking out should never keep you from swinging for the fences			1
@entity0 recently caught up with the host of the podcast " girl on @entity61 , " which inspired the book , out now			1
the edited conversation is below			2
@entity0 : how did an @entity65 grad , with a degree in political science and environmental studies , become interested in comedy ? @entity22 : well , i think i was always interested in comedy			1
i was always a very , kind of , fiction - obsessed kid , and a big reader , and just loved make - believe			0
and then in high school i started to do improv , and sketch comedy , and did that all the way through college			0
i was always interested in performing ... i just came from a really academically driven family			0
i was really focused on school , so it just never seemed like a real job to me			0
and so after i got my degree in government and environmental studies , i thought , " well , now i have a degree and i can take a risk and see if it will pay off because i can always go back to a traditional job			0
" @entity0 : throughout the book , you share stories of your self - inflicted wounds			1
in some way it is an anti-self - help book , showing how failure can help in your success			1
why write about the failures ? @entity22 : i always tell people that success is not the absence of failure , success is persistence through failure			1
so it does show how failure can help			0
i mean i think there are a lot of people who are crippled by a failure			0
crippled by something that goes wrong in their lives			0
and we 're crippled by a fear of failure			0
and the people who say , who say , you know " i do n't want to try this			0
i would like to be a comedian , but i 'm afraid i 'm going to fail			1
i want to write a book , but i 'm afraid i 'm going to fail			1
" and well i say , " you are			0
you are going to fail			0
there 's no doubt about it that something 's going to go terribly wrong			1
" an indivisible aspect of being alive , of being human , of being on this planet , and if you 're not failing , you 're not innovating			0
if you 're not failing , you 're not risking			0
so go for it , and then use the failure as a fuel , use it as a way to become mentally tough because it 's absolutely unavoidable			1
@entity0 : what is it that you want people to most understand about you ? @entity22 : that i 'm not trying to live up to anybody else 's expectations of who i am			1
i 'm going to , not that i 'm striving consciously to be an iconoclast , but i 'm definitely also not striving to meet some set parameters either as an actress , or a comedian , or an artist , or anything			1
i 'm just trying to do what i find compelling			0
@entity0 : what would you tell your younger self about who you are now ? @entity22 : i would probably tell my younger self , " do n't worry about it			1
you 're always going to be a weirdo , and at some point that 's going to be ok			2
that 's eventually going to be your calling card , or your badge of courage , that you 're going to be a weird kid			2
" i mean even now , when i stand on stage , earlier in my career anyway , when people did n't know i did stand - up , i would get up on stage and i would be a 6 - foot - tall black woman , people had very specific expectations about what was going to come out of my mouth			0
and i 've never ever been able to satisfy those expectations , and i realized very early on that i was n't going to change who i was to fulfill a set of expectations that people had about me			0
and i just plowed ahead until my audience found me			0
so i never stopped being a weird kid			0
just that i found weird people who liked what i did			0
@entity0 : how has being different shaped your journey ? @entity22 : i hated when i was a kid being told that , " black people do n't do that			1
" and the white kids at school did n't accept me because i was black , and the black kids in my neighborhood did n't accept me because they thought i thought i was white			0
i was in a no - man 's land			2
and that meant i just got to do what i thought was interesting			0
and that 's just who i 've been since then			2
and it 's guided all of my decisions , which is i have never stopped to think , " oh , you know , does this fit ? " i just do what i want to do			2
@entity0 : what do you believe in ? @entity22 : i believe in hard work			1
i think that everything flows out of that			0
it does n't mean that you 're going to be successful , or traditionally successful because sometimes the world is just unfair , and untalented people get promoted and talented people get left behind , but if you are doing something that you love and you put a lot of hard work into it , you will be rewarded , and that 's been the thing i 've hewn to for my entire adult life			2
@entity0 : anything else ? @entity22 : you ca n't control where you were born , the family you were born into , what you look like , you ca n't control any of those circumstances , the only thing you can control is how you react			1
so for my entire life that 's been the rule that has governed my decisions			2
i ca n't control what 's fair and unfair , i ca n't control the nature of the business , or the nature of society , or the nature of the world , but what i can control is how i choose to see the world and what i choose to put back into it .			2
