@entity0 , @entity1 -- something funny could happen on the way to the @entity6 presidential nomination next year			1
@entity7 might actually win @entity1			1
a triumph by the former @entity10 governor in the first - in - the - @entity1 primary state has long been considered unthinkable by @entity6 insiders here , where @entity7 's northern pedigree and evolving positions on core conservative issues have been viewed with skepticism since his last @entity18 bid in 2008			1
but , as in @entity19 , @entity7 is holding steady at or near the top of the polls in the @entity1 with roughly a quarter of the @entity6 vote in his corner			1
and crucially , no other candidate has managed to rally conservatives and emerge as a serious alternative to the presumed front - runner			1
@entity7 's top backers in this conservative bastion have been cautious about forecasting a victory , especially after his dreary fourth - place finish in the 2008 primary			1
but in recent weeks they have started to see an opening , especially with serious questions surfacing about the candidacies of businessman @entity36 and @entity38 gov. @entity37			0
" it 's gone even better this election cycle than i thought , " said state rep. @entity39 , one of only three elected officials here supporting @entity7			2
" it used to be , ' hey , the guy 's a @entity46			0
he 's the @entity47 governor			0
' but now it 's the economy people are focused on			0
i am liking his chances			0
it would surprise me if he did n't win @entity1			2
" even @entity7 skeptics who have been yearning for a grass - roots conservative savior are beginning to come around to the prospect of a buttoned - up @entity57 grad being the only viable choice come @entity59			1
" i do n't know if the evangelical community is going to rally to one particular candidate or not , " said @entity60 , the @entity61 chancellor who endorsed @entity7 in 2008 but has kept his distance this year			2
" it 's just kind of unpredictable			0
... if i ca n't make up my mind , i 'm going to say , ' which one of these has the best chance at the general election ? ' more than likely that 's going to be @entity7			2
" a top @entity6 fundraiser in the state who backed @entity7 during the last campaign but has actively searched for another candidate this cycle told @entity2 that the ex-governor could win the primary simply by default			1
" it 's like a soccer game : he is going to win a 0 - 0 overtime battle , " said the fundraiser , who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the candidates			1
" at the end of the day , i am going to be forced to pick the smartest , most capable guy in the room			0
at some point you look around the field and that becomes @entity7			2
" after pouring a small fortune into the state in 2008 and lining up a bevy of endorsements -- including the blessings of sen. @entity100 and then a little - known state representative named @entity102 -- @entity7 has just three paid staffers in the state this time around			2
he has not run a single television ad or sent out a piece of mail			0
he can no longer count on the support of @entity100 or @entity102 , now the governor , both of whom have expressed concerns about the health insurance mandate @entity7 implemented in @entity10			2
and on friday , he will make just his fifth campaign stop in the state ahead of a @entity6 debate this weekend in @entity116			0
the @entity1 race is still extraordinarily fluid , with nearly 70 % of @entity6 voters still undecided about the race , according to a @entity121 poll out this week			1
former house speaker @entity122 appears to be the latest candidate on the rise in the state , and he 's adding staff and opening field offices to capitalize on his recent surge			0
but even without a serious organizational footprint in the state , @entity7 has weathered boomlets from two @entity130 , @entity37 and @entity36 , to maintain a poll position in the low to mid- 20s throughout the summer and fall			0
a healthy plurality may be enough to win in a fractured @entity6 race as sen. @entity134 of @entity135 proved in 2008 when he won the primary with 33 % of the vote , while @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity7 divided up the rest of the electorate			1
@entity7 's support is not growing , but it 's not shrinking either			1
" everybody keeps saying he 's stuck at 25 % , 22 % , 27 % , " said @entity6 strategist @entity143 , who worked for @entity7 in 2008 but is not currently on any candidate 's payroll			1
" @entity147 put me in that briar patch			0
i 'd love to be stuck at that number where you 're that close to winning			0
" both @entity7 's supporters and detractors agree that he probably needs to increase his share of the vote into the 30 % range to win in january , meaning that a @entity7 victory in the land of barbecue and college football is far from certain			1
several factors are working against him , including the prospect of an all - out assault on the television airwaves from his @entity6 foes			2
@entity7 has yet to be hit by a negative ad in this race			0
there are also lingering anxieties about @entity7 's squishy moderate reputation among a segment of @entity6 primary voters , particularly in the evangelical - heavy upstate			1
@entity174 , a christian radio host in @entity176 , gave @entity7 credit for running a respectable campaign and said that voters who dial into his show are primarily concerned about economic issues , not social ones			2
he also said he hears almost no talk about @entity7 's @entity46 faith			1
but @entity185 said he is looking elsewhere in the @entity6 race			0
" as an evangelical @entity187 who is concerned about politics , i believe that when @entity7 decided to run for president he changed his views in order to put them in line with enough conservatives to get elected , " he told @entity2			0
the good news for @entity7 is that the impact of race and religion in campaigns has waned in recent election cycles			0
in 2010 , after all , the state elected @entity102 -- a woman of @entity205 descent who was raised as a @entity206 but later joined the @entity207 -- to the @entity208			0
the idea of @entity1 as ground zero for @entity187 conservative voters is also somewhat overstated			2
the share of @entity6 who identify themselves as fundamentalist @entity187 or evangelicals is exactly the same in @entity1 as it is in @entity19 : 40 % , according to recent @entity216 / @entity215 poll			2
economic concerns also remain the pivot point of the @entity6 race , and @entity7 's data - driven turnaround artist pitch is well - tailored to a state with the fourth - highest unemployment rate in the nation			1
then there 's the overlooked fact that @entity7 played relatively well in @entity1 in 2008 and was competitive up until his devastating january losses in @entity19 and @entity227			1
republicans who worked inside the 2008 @entity134 and @entity7 campaigns told @entity2 that their internal polling in the closing weeks before @entity19 showed the @entity1 race to be essentially a three - way tie between @entity138 , @entity7 and @entity134			1
still , the @entity7 campaign has only a scant presence in the state this year , while rivals such as @entity37 , former @entity238 gov. @entity237 , former sen. @entity239 of @entity240 , @entity241 and rep. @entity242 of @entity243 have either been frequent faces in the state or can point to large campaign organizations			0
@entity248 chairman @entity247 said @entity7 should not be counting on the fact that he ran in the state once before			0
" the dynamics are different , and i would n't assume that i could tap into the same grass - roots network that i had four years ago , " @entity247 said			0
" it 's a little presumptuous to think all those people are still in place			0
" but it 's an open question whether a candidate actually needs a robust political organization to win the state , which has sided with the " establishment " pick in each and every @entity6 primary going back to 1980			1
again , @entity1 @entity6 point to @entity102 : the @entity263 darling won a statewide @entity6 primary in 2010 with just four paid staffers and little support from @entity0 insiders			2
similarly , @entity7 is leading the pack with little infrastructure in place , while @entity37 has almost two dozen state legislators backing his campaign but is mired around 10 % in the polls			1
@entity7 has done more to help himself in the state by displaying a toughness in the presidential debates that have come to define the @entity6 race , said longtime @entity6 strategist @entity278 , who advised @entity7 's 2008 bid			1
" he 's shown a new mettle during the course of these debates , " @entity278 said			0
" when everyone was attacking @entity7 , he stood up and fought back			0
" state sen. @entity284 , a leading conservative voice in the state with close ties to the tea party movement , said @entity7 's impressive national campaign may be enough to carry him over the finish line in @entity1			1
it 's a sentiment few here would have expressed in the early days of the @entity6 presidential fight			2
" if you had asked me a month ago , i would have said he probably ca n't win , given that @entity1 is a pretty red - meat @entity6 state , " said @entity284 , who has not endorsed a candidate			1
" now i think he can			0

@entity7 leads the pack in @entity1 with little infrastructure in place
@entity7 's evolving positions on conservative issues have been viewed with skepticism
but no other candidate has emerged as a serious alternative to presumed front - runner
one @entity6 fundraiser predicts : " he is going to win a 0 - 0 overtime battle "
