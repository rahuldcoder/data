the trip was n't so grand for many guests on board @entity4 's @entity3			1
the cruise line cut short a nine - day trip to @entity7 and elsewhere by one day after more than 200 people became ill with norovirus and a passenger experienced a medical emergency requiring medical attention on land			1

the samples will be tested , and the ship 's response to the outbreak will be evaluated			1
" once all guests had debarked @entity3 , we began an extensive and thorough sanitizing onboard the ship and within the cruise terminal , to help prevent any illness from affecting the subsequent sailing , " @entity16 wrote in an email to @entity0			2
" all guests today will receive a letter at boarding that asks if they have experienced any gastrointestinal symptoms within the last three days , " @entity16 said			0
" similarly , if guests are uncomfortable taking their cruise , for reasons related to personal health or otherwise , our staff assisted them in rescheduling their sailing for another time			0
the ship will depart today , as scheduled			2

" it kind of seemed like they were n't being very honest with us about the whole situation			0
we heard that there were three people sick			2
then another person said it was over 100 , so , i mean , we never got a clear answer from any of the crew members , " passenger @entity68 told @entity0 affiliate @entity20			0
" some people were sick three days , vomiting , diarrhea , and they got shots and medication , and they said it was just a cruise from hell , " passenger @entity73 said			0
passenger april @entity80 definitely did n't have the honeymoon of her dreams			0

future cruisers should practice the same hygiene habits at sea that are wise to practice on land to stay healthy , @entity87 , editor - in - chief of @entity88 , wrote in an email			0
" wash your hands frequently and take advantage of the hand - washing stations throughout the ship , " she said			0
" prior to boarding , passengers go through a health screening aimed to help avoid the possibility of any pre-cruise illnesses being brought onboard -- it 's important for cruisers to answer those questions truthfully to keep themselves , and others , healthy			0
