-- want to elevate your home without taking on a complete overhaul ? interior decorator @entity4 -- @entity6 whisperer and master of the cheap trick -- reveals the little tweaks that make the biggest impact			1
@entity0 : how did you get started in this field ? @entity4 : right after getting my architecture degree , i read about the designer @entity15 in a magazine			2
i was so blown away by his bold aesthetic and everything he 'd accomplished by the age of 35 that i wrote him a letter asking for a meeting			2
two weeks later , i had my first full - time job , as his assistant			2
it was fate ! @entity0 : 3 decorators give readers ' rooms makeovers @entity0 : what 's one quick change that will improve any room ? @entity34 : lower the artwork			1

it 's better to cluster art in one or two spots than to spread it out			2
@entity0 : decorating a huge room can be intimidating			1
how do you deal with soaring spaces ? @entity34 : my philosophy is to fill them with large - scale furniture and art. if you 're a less - is - more type , go for one massive piece , like an amazing painting over the sofa			2
@entity0 : suppose you ca n't afford art that big ? @entity34 : buy a blank canvas and paint it yourself			1
pick the most interesting color in the room ( as long as it 's not already the dominant color ) and just cover the canvas in that shade , using the same paint you 'd use for walls			1
there 's no way to mess this up , and it costs next to nothing			2

@entity0 : 40 living room decorating ideas @entity0 : what do you always want to fix when you go into someone 's living room ? @entity34 : the floor plan and lighting ! @entity0 : break that down for us			1
@entity34 : a good living room needs a comfortable place to sit , a place to rest your drink , and a place to read a book			1
but people default to the school - dance arrangement , where everything is pushed back against the walls			0
so i start by moving the furniture closer together , toward the center of the room			1
then i fill out the arrangement with occasional chairs and tables to create functional seating areas			0
it makes the space feel so much more intimate and conversational			0
@entity0 : 20 low - cost decorating ideas @entity0 : and for the lighting ? @entity34 : if we 've learned anything from the movie gremlins , it 's that bright light is the enemy			1

start there , and think from the ground up			1
buy a patterned rug you love : here 's your palette			0
go for a geometric dhurrie if you like modern , or multicolored stripes if you 're more traditional			0
you can pull the wall and furniture colors from the rug , then pick up its accent tones in pillows and other accessories			1
@entity0 : 23 decorating tricks for your bedroom @entity0 : speaking of color , are there any surprising shades you 're really into right now ? @entity34 : i think fuchsia should be the color of the year			0
it 's so rich and chic , it 's like red 's hipper sister			0
i 'd use @entity181 's @entity180 on walls in a room with neutral furniture and gray trim			1
or just do the ceiling ( use high - gloss for that )			0
@entity0 : one piece of advice you 'd shout from the rooftops ? @entity34 : stop overthinking every little change and just try it ! it 's easy to say , " oh , that desk will never work next to my bed			0
" move it and see how it looks			0
sometimes pulling that blue armchair from the den into your green living room can work miracles			2
@entity0 : 16 before - and - after room makeovers @entity0 : name an item you 'd like to banish for good			2
@entity34 : that poufy , marshmallow - shaped leather sofa from 1988			0
i ca n't slipcover it , i ca n't change it , and i ca n't convince someone that it 's not really comfortable , because it is really comfortable			2
