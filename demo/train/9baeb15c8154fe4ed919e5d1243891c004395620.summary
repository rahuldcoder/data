@entity0 , @entity1 -- the miners who survived 69 days in a @entity5 mine toured @entity6 and @entity7 in two double - decker buses thursday evening , receiving cheers and a hero 's welcome from passersby in the the street			1
the miners serenaded anyone who would listen			1
" @entity16 ! " " le - le - le ! " " we the miners of @entity5 ! " they sang in unison			1
some people from the street and even a rooftop sang " @entity5 ! " in return			1
the 33 miners , along with relatives and five of their rescuers , landed in @entity0 earlier in the day thursday for their first group tour to the @entity30 since being freed last month			1
the group is in the nation 's second - largest city to attend " @entity34 : an all - star tribute , " which will air worldwide on @entity37 evening , november 25			1
organizers invited them as special guests			2
the @entity0 police department gave the miners ' two - bus entourage a motorcycle escort from @entity45 to a downtown hotel			1
@entity0 mayor @entity47 greeted the group at the hotel with the traditional @entity50 saying of " @entity51 , " or " my house is your house			2
" " the entire world was watching the success of your rescue , " @entity47 told the group			2
later , the miners , rescuers and their relatives ventured outside the hotel for the first time and found a tv news helicopter and local news stations filming them as they boarded two double - decker buses			1
the entourage visited @entity6 landmarks such as the @entity68 stars on @entity69 , including one belonging to @entity70			2
it was an appropriate pilgrimage because miner @entity72 had led sing - alongs to @entity70 music to lift the spirits of fellow miners during the dark ordeal			1
in fact , he had asked for the music to be sent down into the mine as rescuers drilled a bigger hole to pull the miners out of the ground			1
" he is the king , he is the best , " @entity72 , 34 , said , as he posed for photographs beside @entity70 ' star on @entity69			0
" the sweetest of dreams			0
" the entourage strolled outside the landmark @entity91 , built to resemble a stack of records on a turntable			0
they walked to the heart of the @entity6 noir district , at @entity6 , which is enjoying a construction boom			0
they also toured @entity101 and its @entity103 boutique district			0
bus guides also showed them the grand business concourse of @entity107			0
throughout the sightseeing , the miners , wives and relatives took photographs on their cameras or smartphones			1
shortly after their arrival at the hotel thursday morning , the miner known as " the poet " was freewheeling in the hallway with the other miner known as " @entity121			1
" " where can we go dancing ? " shouted @entity122 , 40 , the @entity5 miner whose exuberant personality earned him the super nickname			1
@entity127 and @entity128 , 34 , the miner - poet , were expressing the collective excitement of the miners , rescuers and their families			1
for the majority of the visitors , the trip was their first time outside of @entity5			1
at the top of their to - do list , besides resting after a 12 - hour flight from @entity139 , @entity5 , was shopping			1
" i want to go to the mall and buy some shoes for my son and daughter , " said @entity144 , 40 , the wife of @entity122			1
for miner @entity150 , 49 , and wife @entity152 , 40 , the visit was a double celebration -- because they experienced the birth of their first grandchild , @entity156 , born wednesday			1
when @entity150 was trapped in the mine for 69 days , his wife was concerned whether the ordeal would be too much of a strain on her pregnant 17 - year - old daughter , @entity162			1
" we were really worried , " @entity152 said , speaking in @entity50 as did his colleagues			0
" my daughter was far into her pregnancy and we were all consumed with what could happen			2
for those 69 days , we were a separated family			0
" the miner - poet @entity128 said he overcame the gloom of entrapment by doing something he had never done before : write poetry			1
he wrote 32 poems -- about his wife , mother , son , relatives , friends			1
he left copies of his verse at home and was unable to share his poetry			0
" i never wrote before , " @entity128 said			0
" it was a way of keeping me from suffering inside the mine			0
i wrote about feelings and how people were suffering on the outside and how they would ever rescue us			0
" like some other miners , he readily offered up his autographs to anyone wanting to meet him			2
" @entity192 , " he wrote in @entity50 near his name			0
@entity193 , the wife of @entity194 , the first miner who was pulled out of the ground last month , described the 69 days of waiting and wondering as one of her worst experiences			1
" it was bad , really bad , " said @entity193			0
" i could n't believe it			0
i was worried about his life , but i believed they would all survive because i had faith and hope			2
" she has since noticed a few different things about herself and husband			0
" we have changed , " @entity193 said			0
" we are more sentimental , and we enjoy more what moments we have together			0
" before arriving in @entity0 , the group made a brief stopover at @entity215 in @entity216 , @entity217 , where the miners signed flags			2
one signed " @entity223 , " which means " heart of a miner			2
" when miner @entity225 prepared to board the plane in @entity139 , @entity5 , on wednesday night , the 27 - year - old said he has only traveled to @entity228			1
" i want to see the world , " he said , smiling			0
" i know all of @entity5 , but not the rest of the world			1
" @entity225 , a mechanic , worked at the @entity232 mine for two years			0
his girlfriend was pregnant while he was trapped			2
the miners captured the world 's imagination when they survived the longest mine entrapment in history , beginning august 5			1
for more than two weeks , many officials thought they were dead			0
but crews made contact after a small borehole enabled communication with the men trapped 2,300 feet underground			2
rescue crews encountered repeated setbacks			0
initially , authorities expected the miners to be trapped until @entity37 or @entity249 because of the difficulty of drilling a new tunnel to extract them			2
on their @entity30 trip , the miners and rescuers will get a whirlwind tour of southern @entity1			2
they 'll see the sights and shop in @entity0 and @entity6 through the weekend			0
the visit is a world away from the miners ' experience in the weeks after the mine collapse that trapped them			2
in the days before they made contact with the ground , some ate about a bottle cap 's worth of canned fish per day and drank mine water that tasted like machine oil			2
they have said they were prepared to die , even as they awaited their rescue			0
the miners and rescuers were invited by @entity2 to attend " heroes , " an annual program now in its fourth year that shines a light on " everyday people changing the world			1
" the @entity5 were extended the invitation because their plight and rescue captured the world 's attention and symbolized the resilience of the human spirit			1
@entity34 received 10,000 nominations from more than 100 countries			0
that list was narrowed down to the @entity291 @entity34			0
the @entity34 will be revealed on the show ; the public votes to select that winner			0
" the heroic efforts of the rescue of these miners was one of the most unifying and inspirational events of the year , " said @entity295 , president of @entity296			1
" @entity34 is a fitting way for @entity2 to honor these men and their rescuers , " he said			0
" we hope viewers around the world will be heartened by the story of their rescue as well as the stories of this year 's top 10 @entity34			1
" ' the miners ' imprisonment began when a ramp into the @entity232 mine -- located in the arid @entity315 of northern @entity5 -- collapsed			1
shift foreman @entity72 told the men that they had a shot of surviving the catastrophe , but there was a good chance they would never again see daylight			0
the men occupied themselves by voting on everything , including how food should be distributed			0
majority rule prevailed -- 17 votes plus one -- but the miners often managed to find common ground and most decisions were unanimous			1
no one was left alone			0
and they became masters of compromise and patience , even as their rations quickly began running out			0
@entity2 's @entity339 and @entity340 contributed to this report .			2
