" named after the @entity23 town they come from , @entity33 is but one of hundreds of similar groups that can be seen and heard performing regularly at shows that resemble sporting competitions			0

@entity72 is n't the southernmost tip of @entity2 it 's a common misconception among tourists who trek to the @entity76 and climb the steps to the lighthouse to assume there 's no land between them and @entity82			1
it certainly looks that way from this magnificent viewpoint			0
except for the inconvenient fact that those truly wishing to be at the bottom of @entity2 have to travel about another 170 kilometers southeast to the rocky outcrop at @entity90			1

one street , two @entity127 winners @entity128 punches way above its weight			0
before the arrival of democracy in @entity2 , @entity128 looked like any other nondescript dusty street full of matchbox houses in @entity135 , near @entity46			1

the smallest villages in the @entity209 still try to whip up some of his more famous recipes when the ingredients are available			0
porcupine crackling is one of them			0
from his @entity217 book , @entity203 's preparation instructions call for plunging the animal into boiling water , scraping off the quills and hairs , scrubbing the skin until it 's perfectly smooth and white and then discarding the meat , which , he says , is n't very nice to eat			2
