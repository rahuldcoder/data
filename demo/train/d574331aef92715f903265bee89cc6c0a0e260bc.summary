@entity0 -- a request by @entity4 's children that a temporary conservator be appointed for their ailing father was denied by a judge on tuesday			1
@entity4 's daughter @entity8 and her husband filed a conservatorship petition in a @entity0 court last month , claiming the retired radio host " has been isolated from his daughters , friends and other family " by his wife			1
@entity19 judge @entity18 ruled tuesday that @entity4 , 81 , was being well cared for by his wife , @entity20			1
" as my clients have n't had the opportunity to see their father for some months now , they were happy to learn through investigation of the court appointed expert and the probate investigator that their father was being physically well taken care of , " said @entity21 , the lawyer for @entity8			2
@entity4 , who for decades hosted radio music countdown shows " @entity35 " and " @entity36 , " is suffering from parkinson 's disease and " may have early onset @entity40 's dementia , " according to a court filing			1
the children , who have been fighting with their stepmother , are hoping they can soon see their father , @entity21 said			0
while they have not spoken to her , their lawyers are discussion a visitation plan , he said			0
" also they were happy that the judge focused her attention on the important issue of visitation , " he said			0
" mr. @entity4 has a long strong and loving relationship with his adult children and we are continuing to try and reach resolution with the other side so visits can begin again			2
" @entity58 will hold another hearing on december 20 to decide if she will appoint a permanent conservator			1
@entity4 has the " ability to shuffle short distances , but is mainly bedridden and requires the assistance of a wheelchair to move any distance , " a court document said			2
the petition claims that daughter @entity8 and her husband , dr. @entity69 , have been unable to check on @entity4 's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions			1
they " have been prevented from exercising their duties " by @entity20 , who has been married to the retired radio host for three decades , the filing contends			1
" there is no communication between @entity20 and us and his daughters , " brother @entity83 said saturday			2
" we have no knowledge of how he is , what he 's doing , if he 's better , if he 's worse , and we 're scared that we 'll never see him again			2
" the petition claims @entity4 's wife has refused to provide the children with the name of their father 's primary care physician			1
that doctor would be consulted to determine @entity4 's " ability to act on his own behalf , " which is the question that would cause the health care power of attorney to take effect , it said			1
daughter @entity104 said last month that her stepmother suddenly barred her sister , her uncle and some of @entity4 's friends from seeing him about three months ago			1
she said she was perplexed by the decision			0
" i do n't get it , i do n't understand it , " said @entity104 , who co-hosts the radio show " @entity110 " with @entity112 's @entity111			2
" he has @entity40 's , and all the research we 've done indicates socialization would help him			1
" @entity1 has reached out to get a statement from @entity20 , but has been unsuccessful			0
@entity104 and other members of the family held a protest at @entity4 's @entity124 house to raise public attention to their dispute last month			1
the fight is not about an inheritance , @entity104 said			0
" my dad told us a long time ago we were not in the will , and we 're ok with that			0
we 've known that for years , " she said			0
" i 've never asked him for anything , nor have i asked @entity20 for anything			0
" @entity137 , @entity4 's agent of more than 35 years , said he did not want to take sides in the argument , but he did say @entity4 is still of sound mind			1
" he has @entity40 's , has it very bad			1
it took his speech , and for somebody who made millions of dollars using his voice -- for him to lose that gift , that beautiful instrument -- it must be frustrating			0
but he 's handling it very well , " @entity137 said			2
" his mind is very sharp , his brain works well			0
you can tell in his eyes he understands everything you 're saying			0
he just has trouble translating it from the brain to his vocal cords			0
" besides the famed countdown shows , @entity4 was also the voice of @entity159 in the cartoon " @entity161 " and an announcer for @entity163			2
he was a popular dj and occasional actor before " @entity35 " began in 1970			0
@entity1 's @entity165 contributed to this report .			0
