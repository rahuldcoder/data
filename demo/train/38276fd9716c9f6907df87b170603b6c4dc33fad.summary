-- @entity1 does n't want to believe that her missing daughter could be connected to a registered sex offender accused of killing a @entity5 teen			1
" that would mean that she 's dead , and i do n't want to think that , " said @entity1 , whose 14 - year - old daughter , @entity6 , was last seen walking alone to school on february 13 , 2009			1
but authorities say they are looking into whether @entity6 , who pleaded not guilty wednesday to raping and murdering @entity6 , was involved in @entity6 's disappearance			1
" we have been working closely with @entity19 sheriff 's office , and our investigators are working with theirs in case there is a connection , " lt. @entity14 with the @entity15 , @entity5 , @entity13 said			2
" we are involved in the daily briefings on the @entity6 investigation			1
" @entity6 's father , @entity26 , attended @entity6 's arraignment wednesday			1
" just the similarities in our case , you know , if there is any connection to mr. @entity6 and our case , i want to be there for his prosecution and soon to be execution i would hope , " @entity6 told @entity29 's @entity28			1
@entity6 's family lives in the @entity19 , @entity5 , suburb of @entity15 , less than 10 miles from @entity41 , where @entity6 was last seen alive			1
the shy , bookish teen was walking to @entity43 when she disappeared			0
she had a check in her backpack to buy a lamb for a @entity48 project , according to her mother			0
but she never made it , and since then , investigators have been stymied by a lack of viable leads			0
@entity1 says @entity6 came up on her radar shortly after @entity6 disappeared , when she began looking up registered sex offenders in the area			1
" one of the first things we did when we could n't find her was look at the sex offenders in the area because we know that they have a history of repeated offenses , " @entity1 said			0
" i did n't personally visit his home but one of our volunteers did , and we did n't find anything that raised suspicions			0
" @entity6 is on @entity5 's sex offender registry for a conviction of lewd or lascivious acts with a child under 14 , according to online records			1
he was also charged wednesday with assault with intent to commit rape in connection with an attack on a jogger in december 2009			0
a call to @entity6 's public defender , @entity82 , was not immediately returned			2
in addition to keeping the search going for her daughter , @entity1 has also become involved in educating parents and children on how to prevent abductions			0
she also spends time reaching out to parents of other missing children			0
as soon as she learned of @entity92 's disappearance , @entity1 says she contacted @entity92 's parents and assisted in search efforts			1
@entity92 's car , with her cell phone inside , was found at the @entity97 , where she was known to go for runs			1
" ever since @entity6 went missing i 've reached out to all the parents i possibly can because once it happens to you , it 's going to be with you the rest of your life , " she said			2
" it becomes your life			0
supporting families , that 's what it 's all about			0
even when we find @entity6 , i 'll continue because i would n't want any other family to go through this			2
" searchers found a body tuesday that they believe to be @entity6 's , @entity116 @entity115 said at a news conference tuesday			1
he said he expected a positive identification of the body to come this week			0
to some in @entity6 's family , @entity92 's disappearance has other stinging implications			1
" it 's heartbreaking in another way because now we know of everything that was available to search for @entity6 but was n't used , " @entity124 said			2
" there were n't helicopters used with heat sensitivities , there were n't any dogs brought out for @entity6 , and now to know that 's available , it 's heartbreaking to think it was n't used			2
" but @entity14 said investigators used all the resources available to them			0
" we asked for and received the resources we needed at the time , " he said			0
" as far as law enforcement is concerned , we had outstanding cooperation from local agencies , the @entity143 , the @entity144 , and we had a significant amount of resources at our disposal			0
" @entity6 's mother has her doubts as to whether @entity6 could actually be involved			1
" i think the guy is too sloppy and that we would 've found some evidence if he had taken @entity6 , " she said			2
" but he never should have been out in public			0
if he were incarcerated , like he should have been , maybe @entity92 would be alive right now			2
