how can it be ? the @entity2 and @entity3 , sworn enemies for 35 years , are talking about working together to quell the @entity5 - inspired insurgency sweeping northern @entity6			1
they are fierce adversaries on issues such as terrorism , @entity3 's nuclear ambitions and @entity13 's civil war			2
@entity3 leaders call the @entity2 the " @entity18 , " while former president @entity15 labeled @entity3 as part of an " @entity17			1
" it was headline news last year when their leaders spoke briefly by phone , the first contact at that level since the @entity21 in 1979 drove the @entity2 - backed @entity24 from power			0
but should we be too surprised by this latest version of strange bedfellows , now known as " frenemies " in the modern vernacular ? there 's even an old saying of uncertain origin to define it -- the enemy of my enemy is my friend			0
what 's going on ? this time , the common enemy is the threat of a regional war based on sectarian battle lines , pitting @entity43 and @entity44 governments and peoples against each other across the @entity47			0
only the @entity48 in @entity6 and @entity13 ( @entity49 ) and its @entity5 backers would want that , it seems			1
they seek to establish a @entity43 - dominated @entity53 state stretching from @entity6 to northern @entity13			2
" we are now closer than ever to a regional war in the @entity47 , " said @entity54 , who heads the @entity55 on @entity13			0
" events in neighboring @entity6 will have grave and violent repercussions for @entity13			0
the most dangerous aspect of these developments has been the rise of the sectarian threat , a direct consequence of the dominance of extremist groups like @entity49			0
" @entity44 majority @entity3 seeks to protect @entity44 interests and power in @entity6 , while the @entity2 wants to see a stable @entity6 after pulling its troops out of the country in 2011 to end its eight - year campaign that began by toppling @entity73 from power			1
also , @entity3 has sounded a more positive tone toward the @entity76 since last year 's election of president @entity78 to succeed the more volatile @entity79			0
on wednesday , @entity78 pledged that @entity3 would do whatever was necessary to protect @entity44 holy sites in @entity6			1
where do things stand ? @entity2 secretary of state @entity84 suggested possible collaboration with @entity3 , telling @entity86 on monday that " we are open to discussions if there 's something constructive that can be contributed by @entity3 -- if @entity3 is prepared to do something that is going to respect the integrity and sovereignty of @entity6			1
" then , the @entity2 and @entity3 held " very brief discussions " about @entity6 and the threat posed by @entity49 on the sidelines of nuclear negotiations in @entity100 , @entity95 spokeswoman @entity94 said			1
a senior @entity95 official said while @entity108 was open to engaging the @entity3 , " these engagements will not include military coordination or strategic determinations about @entity6 's future over the heads of the @entity6 people			1
" the official said on condition of not being identified that the discussion concerns the @entity49 threat to " many countries in the region , including @entity3 , " as well as the need to support a more inclusive approach by the @entity6 government than the sectarian efforts by prime minister @entity118			1
what 's in it for the @entity2 ? defense minister @entity121 noted wednesday that the @entity2 and @entity3 cooperated early in the @entity123 war			1
he told a congressional panel that " we had worked with the @entity3 on that western border of @entity123			0
" " so there 's some history here of sharing common interests , " @entity127 said , citing " significant differences " with @entity3 , but adding that " i do n't think these issues come neatly wrapped in geopolitical graduate school papers			0
" even a conservative member of @entity136 who once advocated military strikes on @entity3 said @entity108 may need @entity139 's help			1
" i 'll talk to anybody to help our people from being captured or killed , " @entity140 sen. @entity140 of @entity141 said			0
" and this is a time where the @entity3 in a small way might help			0
" @entity140 made clear he disapproved of @entity3 , calling authorities " thugs and killers , " then summed up the situation by saying : " but we are where we are			0
" a host of experts agree , including @entity154 , a former deputy national security adviser during the @entity6 war			0
" there is a political solution here that i think could be both in @entity3 's interest and the @entity2 interest , " @entity154 said			1
whether the @entity2 likes it or not , working with @entity3 on the @entity6 crisis might be a necessary evil , retired maj. gen. @entity161 said			1
" there are necessary steps that we have to take with @entity139 that we 've probably never taken before , and would prefer not to take , " @entity166 said			0
what 's the downside ? teaming up with @entity3 could certainly have its pitfalls			0
the @entity2 is wary of furthering @entity3 's already considerable influence in @entity6			1
the @entity44 @entity3 regime is @entity118 's closest ally in the region , and a @entity2 - @entity3 partnership could alienate @entity6 's @entity43 population as well as @entity43 nations in the region such as @entity181 that are @entity2 allies			1
meanwhile , the @entity2 does n't want to jeopardize international talks on @entity3 's nuclear program that resumed this week			2
the talks are intended to prevent @entity3 from developing a nuclear weapon , and the @entity2 and @entity186 have repeatedly said they would use military means against @entity3 if necessary to achieve that outcome			2
house speaker @entity190 said wednesday that the @entity2 should " absolutely not " talk to @entity3 about the @entity6 crisis			1
" i can just imagine what our friends in the region , our allies will be thinking by reaching out to @entity3 at a time when they continue to pay for terrorists and foster terrorism not only in @entity13 , in @entity203 but in @entity186 as well , " the @entity193 @entity140 told reporters			0
will @entity3 and the @entity2 work together on the ground ? a senior security official in @entity206 said @entity3 has already sent about 500 @entity208 troops to help fight the @entity49 militants			1
@entity78 then denied that happened , but said he would be open to helping if asked , according to @entity3 state tv			2
a @entity213 spokesman said monday that military coordination with @entity3 was not in the cards , similar to what the senior @entity95 official told @entity218			0
at the @entity220 , spokesman @entity219 said @entity221 has ruled out sending any @entity2 combat troops to @entity6			2
however , @entity140 noted the need to coordinate in other ways , such as coordinating possible @entity2 air strikes on @entity49 fighters if @entity221 orders them			2
" if we start flying airplanes , it makes some sense to talk to the @entity3 about what we 're doing so they do n't shoot us down and we do n't bomb them , " he said			0
back to @entity6 : what can -- and should -- the @entity2 do now ?			2

both @entity3 , @entity2 want to quell the @entity49 militant surge in @entity6
secretary of state @entity84 suggests possible collaboration with @entity3
the issue raises questions in @entity136
working with @entity3 might be a necessary evil , retired @entity2 general says
