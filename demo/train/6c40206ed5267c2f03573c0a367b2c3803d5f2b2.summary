-- when we think of the perfect summer blockbuster , we think of action -- and july 's " @entity5 " will have more than enough , star @entity1 says			1
the 44 - year - old is back for another round as the ferocious mutant @entity8 , but @entity10 's take is somewhat darker than its predecessors			1
as the trailers have shown , the typically sly @entity8 appears to be in a pretty serious funk as he 's haunted by thoughts of @entity15 ( @entity16 )			2
when a man whose life he once saved summons him to @entity20 , the ageless mutant is presented with an offer of mortality as a so - called expression of gratitude			1
" he 's sort of interested in it , because if your life is not great and there is a lot of regret and pain , would it be great to live on and on ? " @entity1 said of his character 's dilemma			1
and yet , as @entity5 hints in the trailer , the time has n't come where he has nothing left to live for			1
fans are anticipating seeing the iconic " x-men " character put up an intense fight against his foes -- part of which happens atop a bullet train , as previews have shown			1
" the only bad thing about filming a scene on the bullet train is that the wind machines are so powerful that when you watch it back on the monitor , you 're like , ' man , i got to get a facelift because there 's just skin flying everywhere , ' " @entity1 joked			1
" when i was lying on that train , i would just get pushed back -- and a couple of times , i just fell off of the train			2
" but , as a guy who loves the " popcorn element " of summer movies , he knows those sorts of action sequences are what audiences are hoping for			1
" yes , ( ' the @entity5 ' ) is a character piece , and i would say it may be a little darker in tone than the others , and it certainly feels a little different , ( but ) it 's just as much fun , " @entity1 said			1
" the action is probably in this is more inventive than we 've ever had before			1
" @entity0 's @entity76 spoke with @entity1 about how he bulked up once again , his character 's vulnerable side and why @entity5 makes a pretty solid wingman for a teen			1
@entity0 : looking at you , the only thing i can say is , " @entity5 is back ! " @entity1 : he 's back , and i could n't be happier			1
i never in a million years would 've thought ( that ) i 'd still be playing this character ( 12 years later )			2
it kind of really is shocking to me , but at the same time , it 's such an instant gratitude , because i love this character			2
@entity0 : so you know him now , really know him ? @entity1 : i hope so			1
i feel like i do			2
i certainly feel proprietorial over him , and , you know , i have now read a lot of ( the ) comic books			2
being someone who had never read the comic books , when i first heard about the audition , i was like , ' they want me to play @entity98 ? ' who is the lead of this @entity101 rock band called the @entity102			2
... so i knew nothing			2
it 's been a great ride			2
@entity0 : this picks up after " @entity107 , " so we do know that @entity15 ( @entity16 ) has met her demise -- but i 've seen the trailers			2
she 's there ! @entity1 : i do n't want to give away too much			1
she is there in the way that loved ones are always there ... in a very real way , she 's there			2
@entity0 : is it safe to say that @entity5 , especially in this movie , is a little bit of a sensitive superhero ? @entity1 : he 's certainly more vulnerable			1
@entity0 : he 's a broken man , a bit			2
@entity1 : oh , yeah			1
i mean , @entity5 is the toughest superhero			1
i may be biased , but i think he 's the toughest			0
he does n't necessarily have the strongest powers on paper , but ... he 's the one guy who you do n't want to be on his bad side			0
in this movie , however , you kind of see the toll of that ; we start with him questioning everything			2
his life has been dominated by pain , by regret , mistakes ... @entity0 : he loses the love of his life			0
@entity1 : ( @entity143 ) loses the love of his life , ( and ) we 've seen that impact			1
he 's one of those people where whenever he gets close to someone , bad things tend to happen			0
so in a way , not only for himself but for the world , he decides to just completely go off the reservation and sort of deny who he is and be like a recluse			0
@entity0 : but there is something that 's bringing him back @entity1 : there is something bringing him back			1
... he just ca n't help himself , you know ? i think the thing i love about him is , you know , he 's reluctant , he does n't want to get involved , he 's not an idealist , but at the end of the day when there is an injustice , he ca n't help but rise to the occasion			0
@entity0 : he 's such a great character			0
( playing him ) had to raise the cool factor by 20 million with your kids			0
@entity1 : it does , yeah			1
except now my son 's turning 13 , and he 's like , " you 're really nothing like @entity5 , are you ? " @entity0 : does he use that to attract girls ? @entity1 : this is very weird , but on some level , i 'm kind of a wingman for my son , who 's turning 13			1
this sounds very politically incorrect , but it 's weird because most of the time , he does n't want to talk about it with me			0
he does n't talk about it much ; he just wants me to be @entity188			0
but i spotted him at the beach a couple years back , and he was talking to some girl who must have been 14 or 15			0
i was like , " hmm ... like father , like son			0
" and all of a sudden , he 's pointing at me , and he walks over towards me			0
and he 's sort of walking ahead of the girl , he 's about 20 yards in front of the girl , and he 's going , " @entity188 ... @entity5			1
just give an autograph , will you ? " and i was like , " ok			0
" @entity0 : you sealed the deal for your son ! @entity1 : for my then - 11 - year - old son ! i know ! if you see me in bars in about 10 years time , stop me ! @entity0 : does the process of bulking up ever get tedious ? i mean , there 's muscles everywhere			1
@entity1 : i 'll be honest with you , i kind of love it ; i love the challenge of it			1
my personality is , ' i have to be in better shape than the last time			0
" ... i feel really blessed to have the role , and i want to do it better every time , and so for me , the physicality of @entity5 is everything			1
i 've realized it 's preparation , it 's time			2
like in some of the old movies , you could see i did n't have time to prep			0
and i 'm 44 now , so i need the time			0
@entity0 : how much time did you spend getting ready ? @entity1 : three hours a day			1
i had a mentor , @entity222 , the @entity223			0
we 're mates , and i said , ' mate , i need to know what you do			0
" and he said , " tell me you 've got six months ? ... you need six months to do this			0
" he told me the diet -- 6,000 calories -- ( and that ) you have to train like no one else			1
@entity0 : what does 6,000 calories a day consist of ? @entity1 : it 's six meals , with each meal having some kind of protein -- chicken , steak , fish , eggs -- a lot of it			1
if you 're lucky enough , as you 're bulking , you get brown rice or sweet potato			0
and then in the last month , i cut all the carbs out , and then it 's a lot of steamed veggies			0
it 's pretty plain , there 's no salt , very little seasoning			0
and that 's the big that gets hard			2
this is what i learned : when i started , i used to think , " you want to be bigger ? you want to be in better shape ? train harder , train harder , train harder ! " it 's not not ( that ) , it 's the food			0
seventy percent of the way you look is your diet , 30 % is your training			0
so if there 's anything you 've got to concentrate on , it 's the food			0
@entity0 : when you 're done , what 's the first thing you go for ? @entity1 : lasagna , ice cream , desserts , pizza ... all that stuff			1
@entity0 : that 's probably one of the happiest days of your life			0
i love it so much			0
i eat pretty much everything			0
" @entity5 " opens in the @entity282 on july 26			1
