-- humorist @entity1 is back with a new book			1
the prolific writer shares parenting stories in " you can date boys when you 're forty : @entity1 on @entity8 and other topics he knows very little about			1
" he has written more than 30 books , but this is the first that headlines his role as a parent			1
despite the title , @entity1 explains , it 's not purely a parenting book			1
" i would n't want anybody to think that this is a book where they 're going to learn useful information about parenting , " he said			1
" or , really , anything else			2
" like many of his books , this is a collection of essays sharing his opinions on a wide range of issues and experiences			1
readers will learn about his impressions of " @entity37 , " his tips on how to cook a steak and his hatred of his mail			2
the 66 - year - old also shares personal stories about his kids , @entity45 , 33 , and @entity46 , 14			2
he reveals that he " made the ultimate sacrifice " for his daughter : he took her to a @entity51 concert			1
@entity1 received a @entity52 for his nationally syndicated humor column			1
for nearly 30 years , he has lived in @entity54 , which has provided plenty of fodder for his fiction and nonfiction books			1
" if you want to write humor , just come here , " he said			2
" you do n't really need a sense of humor at all			2
you just write down what people actually do here , and it strikes everyone else as outrageously funny			2
" @entity1 spoke to @entity0 about his new book , his daughter 's changing musical tastes and his plans for his next project			1
below is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : what parenting advice would you offer ? @entity1 : i 'd say lighten up			1
i think a lot of parents get pretty intense			2
as far i can tell , more it 's the moms than the dads , partly because the dads , let 's face it , are irresponsible scum and do n't even necessarily know how old their children are or what their names are			1
it 's the moms who are doing everything			2
but they sometimes get a little hovery			2
and a little too determined to actually control the outcome of their child 's lives , which you really ca n't do			2
but there seem to be parents who believe they can			2
@entity0 : have you modified your parenting style having a daughter versus a son ? @entity1 : absolutely			1
girls turn into women , and they do it really fast and dramatically and terrifyingly			2
suddenly -- boom ! -- they are women			0
and then , boys come around			0
i did n't worry about sex or social life or anything like that			0
with @entity46 , i 'm really aware of boys , because i happen to be one , or i was one			1
i 'm a male , and i know we 're scum			1
when they show up , they 're nice to me , because i 'm the dad			1
but they 're not fooling me			1
i know they 're scum , deep inside			1
i want them to go away			0
it would be nice if i could get a humane trap , a boy trap , that i would put on the lawn			0
it would be baited with something that boys like , like fireworks , something insane			0
when i hear it clang shut , i would go out and take the boy and release him humanely in the @entity132			0
@entity0 : how does @entity46 feel ? is she ok with waiting until she 's 40 to date ? @entity1 : no. she would completely disregard anything i would tell her about boys			1
she is in this world			0
they are so connected , these kids			0
she is close , personal best friends with basically every young teenage girl in @entity139			0
they are all connected on @entity141 or @entity142 or whatever it is they 're on now			1
she is constantly communicating with at least 17,000 people at once			0
she is part of this matrix of girls			0
so she has no interest at all in what i have to say			0
she does n't have time , really , to communicate with me , other than , " would you prefer waffles this morning or @entity155 ? " that 's my main communication			0
her interest in my opinion about boys is , i would say , close to zero			0
@entity0 : aside from the @entity51 concert , what other sacrifices have you made as a parent ? @entity1 : the bad news is , ( @entity46 ) is on a travel soccer team			1
instead of watching her dance , now i watch her play soccer			0
i like it , but it 's the travel part that i do n't get			0
we 'll drive 400 miles to watch our team lose			0
i 'm thinking , why could n't we just stay home and play somebody that can beat us ? why do we have to go to all that effort to lose ? i like being a parent , but there are sacrifices			1
@entity0 : do you have any advice for @entity51 , who has been in the news lately for the wrong reasons ? @entity1 : he should listen to somebody beside whoever he 's listening to now			1
i do n't think he 's getting a ton of guidance			0
my main advice is to him is , " just stay away from my daughter , @entity51			1
she does n't like you any more anyway			0
" she likes one direction			0
as of this morning , anyway			0
@entity0 : what is your next project ? @entity1 : i wrote a book called " the worst class trip ever			1
" it 's about an eighth - grade class trip that goes really wrong			0
i was a chaperone on a class trip with my daughter			1
nothing went particularly wrong ; it 's just , i thought , " man			0
this would be a good opportunity for a book			1
things could go really wrong			0
" you have a bunch of kids and a bunch of parents who are basically rank amateurs , wrangling children in a strange place			0
things could go really wrong			0
it 's a class from @entity54 , based on my daughter 's middle school really , that goes on a class trip to @entity224			2
five kids get involved in a seriously bad situation			0
@entity1 's latest book of essays , " you can date boys when you 're forty : @entity1 on @entity8 and other topics he knows very little about , " published march 4 .			1

@entity1 : " just stay away from my daughter , @entity51 "
