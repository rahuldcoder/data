@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 's new found wealth has seen an explosion in the number of new developments springing up in what is , arguably , the world 's biggest building boom			1
the construction of the @entity13 project is underway in @entity14			1
nowhere is this more apparent than in @entity14 , which has transformed into a virtual construction zone as the city undergoes an @entity19 makeover			1
once a flat cityscape in the shadow of the formidable @entity22 , @entity14 has been struck by skyscraper fever			1
the city is now an architect 's playground with foreign " starchitects , " like @entity28 flocking to the country armed with individual creations that push aesthetic and technological boundaries			2
and the latest addition to the @entity14 skyline is no exception			1
standing on the edge of the former site of the city 's historic walls are a series of eight asymmetrical towers that bestride the smog - laden landscape like a colossus			1
dubbed the @entity14 linked @entity44 , this architectural maverick has certainly pushed the design envelope to its very limit			1
the brainchild of @entity51 architect @entity50 , the mixed - use unit is a ring of eight 21 - story towers , linked at the 20th floor by gently sloping public sky bridges , lined with galleries , cafes , restaurants , bars and shops			1
the development has been widely praised for its forward thinking sustainable design that includes a waste water recycling plant that sits beneath the complex and one of the world 's largest geothermal systems , which eliminates the need for boilers or electrical air conditioners			1
it also has green roofs , filters to protect residents from pollution and large ponds to harvest recycled rainwater			2
the complex comes with its own @entity79 hotel and the 15 - acre grounds feature everything from a basketball court to tai chi platforms , a cinematheque , bank , dry cleaners and even a kindergarten			1
for its 2,500 inhabitants , there are enough facilities and services to ensure they never have to leave the confines of the complex -- except maybe to go to work -- when it opens in october 2008			2
linked @entity44 is , in effect , a city within a city			1
@entity50 , who is also a professor at @entity99 , describes it as a " visionary project on all levels " and an " ultra modern expression of ecological urban living			2
" however , for all its plaudits , the @entity13 project has attracted many criticisms			2
among them is that its brand of green luxury wo n't come cheap			2
with apartments selling for 44,000 yuan , or $ 6,000 , per square meter , it can only appeal to @entity4 's nouveaux riches , further creating social division in what is already a deprived area of the city			2
sound off : tell us what you think of the @entity13 project			2
critics also argue its city within a city element has isolationist overtones , reminiscent of gated communities that are becoming increasingly popular around the world			2
for @entity131 - based architect and urbanist , @entity133 , buildings like @entity13 form part of the problem and not the solution , although he applauds the efforts to " green - up " the project			1
" this is a remarkably cold , hostile , hermetic place , " he tells @entity2			0
" the disconnect with the surrounding urban fabric emphasizes the sense that the @entity13 's principle references are to itself , not the larger city			0
" the project is inward focused , the towers gathered around a central water feature at the middle of the towers			1
the towers seem to be in a conversation with one another , but not necessarily with the surrounding city			1
" @entity133 , a former chief curator of @entity131 's @entity155 , believes the concept of a street in the sky is " antagonistic " to how cities should work			1
" first , last and always , great places , great cities , begin with great public domains , and in particular with their streets			1
we all own the street : it is the place where we all belong , where we can move and linger , where we can erect monuments to tell our stories , where we can sit and watch our neighbors , or sit and sip and read the news of the day			0
" " one of the joys of urban life is the collision of uses , the chance to sit and observe the passing scene , to see and be seen , " he adds			0
this , he contends , can not be done within @entity13 where the inhabitant takes on more of an observational role			0
" in the instance of the @entity185 , this experience seems more like being in an observation tower , and less like being in the middle of a bustling , alive , exciting city , " he says			0
chief among the criticisms the @entity13 project has attracted is that it is entirely out of context with its environment and " desecrates " the former imperial city			0
linked @entity44 is sited just 2.5 miles from the @entity22 and its residents can apparently see into the former palace on a " clear day , " @entity50 tells @entity2			1
but @entity50 is adamant this is no 21st century @entity22			0
" @entity13 is no more isolationist than @entity200 in @entity51 , " he says			0
" we modeled it on the @entity203			0
anyone can go in but of course the owner reserves the right to refuse entry			0
" but people need to come in to allow the shops and commercial base to be successful			0
" furthermore , @entity50 rejects assertions that this is " fortress architecture " designed to keep all but the very rich out			0
he said : " it 's a very open and porous building , " he says			1
" it 's free passage and the very opposite of a gated community			0
our scheme is going against what 's currently being built in @entity4			0
" what is being built now are point towers , isolated at the base			1
gated communities with no services			0
i believe that we had to make a project that has a vision for urban interaction , one that has services , and is open to the public			2
there are actually 15 different ways to enter the complex			0
" however , the concept of a city within a city , one that appears disconnected from its surrounding environment , rests uneasily with some , who see it as the stuff of dystopic science fiction			0
some , like @entity14 - based designer @entity245 , believe @entity4 ought to preserve more of its traditional housing forms like the centuries - old villages and hutong -- neighborhoods traversed by narrow , winding alleys			1
" these new buildings are totally different -- they are just dumped down as if from nowhere			0
there is no harmony or overall concept or town planning , " @entity252 said in a @entity254 interview			0
but as @entity4 hurtles headlong into rampant modernization and urbanization , producing millions of new homeowners , its social fabric and thousands of years of its history will no doubt become fundamentally , and irrevocably , altered .			0
