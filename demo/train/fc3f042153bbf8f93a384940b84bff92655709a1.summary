at a meeting friday in @entity12 , world leaders will look to mount pressure against @entity15 president @entity14			0
the meeting of the " @entity9 " group is " part of our ongoing efforts with our friends , allies , and the @entity15 opposition to crystallize next steps to halt the slaughter of the @entity15 people and pursue a transition to democracy in @entity9 , " @entity17 spokeswoman @entity16 said			1
more than 70 countries have been invited			0
@entity32 , which recently vetoed a @entity34 resolution aimed at stopping the violence in @entity9 , is not taking part			1

and @entity46 foreign minister @entity45 said @entity46 would not participate in the @entity9 conference , according to the official news agency @entity48			1
@entity49 , which also vetoed the resolution , has not announced a decision			0
" if , in fact , @entity49 chooses to accept the invitation , that will certainly be a positive sign of its willingness to work with the rest of us to try to end the violence , " @entity16 said			0
the meeting 's location is significant because it was in @entity12 last year that the uprisings that became known as the " @entity63 " began			0
" the failure to get a @entity34 resolution , blame for that rests on two countries , " @entity17 spokesman @entity64 told reporters wednesday			1
" so the international community is fairly united in trying to help the people of @entity9			1
the question is , what do we do ? " we talked about humanitarian assistance and trying to work those avenues , cease - fires , we need to get the @entity15 regime to stop the onslaught of @entity80			1
these are immediate goals and immediate objectives as we head into @entity83			0
" the death toll in @entity9 is edging toward 9,000 , according to the opposition @entity85 ( @entity85 )			1

journalists ' deaths highlight dangers @entity112 videos corroborated by activists ' accounts showed hundreds of students at the @entity116 marching to the campus center -- @entity118 -- and taking down the @entity120 's flag , then raising the pro-democracy flag , referred to by activists as the " independence flag			2
" it was used by the @entity15 republic before @entity126 took power in 1971			0
shortly after that , security forces and pro-government supporters opened fire to disperse the protesters , the activists said			0
protests in @entity95 are significant because the city 's population , along with areas in @entity107 , represent the upper - middle class who traditionally have benefited from the @entity14 regime			0
in @entity107 , security forces closed entrances and exits and then arrested more than 800 civilians at the @entity144 in the middle of the capital city , activists said			2

about 500 soldiers defected from the @entity15 army 's 17th regiment and joined the opposition @entity156 , forming a brigade in @entity103 , opposition leader @entity152 told @entity0			1
some of the worst violence wednesday was in the besieged city of @entity80 , where many residents have been unable to move and have been without critical supplies for weeks			2

read @entity187 's final report for the @entity183 @entity99 foreign minister @entity190 said journalist @entity191 was killed in a bombing			0
@entity15 state tv showed a banner wednesday saying the ministry of information had no knowledge of the presence of the journalists , and it requested that officials in @entity80 look for them			1
the @entity15 regime has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists , making it impossible to verify many opposition or government reports			1
but some journalists have managed to get into @entity9 without the government 's knowledge			1
the night before , @entity212 was on air with @entity0 describing the onslaught in @entity80			2
" the @entity15 army is shelling the city of cold , starving civilians , " she said			0
@entity212 , a veteran correspondent who also covered last year 's @entity220 civil war , said the @entity15 crisis was the worst conflict she had covered , partly because of the volume of ammunition and shelling falling on @entity80			1
" there 's a lot of snipers on the high buildings surrounding the @entity80 neighborhood			2
you can sort of figure out where a sniper is , but you ca n't figure out where a shell is going to land , " she said			0
the deaths wednesday followed that of @entity241 reporter @entity240 , who was reporting in eastern @entity9 when he died last week , apparently from an asthma attack , the newspaper said			2
opinion : the world owes a debt to slain journalists @entity9 routinely blames the violence on " armed terrorist groups			1

also , a group assassinated an engineer and wounded his 16 - year - old son in @entity102 , the @entity249 report said			0
five members of the army and law enforcement were buried wednesday , @entity249 said			0
the vast majority of accounts from inside @entity9 indicate @entity14 's forces are slaughtering civilians in an attempt to wipe out opposition members , who are demanding his ouster and democratic reforms			1
@entity212 , interviewed hours before her death , described the heartbreak of watching a boy die after being struck in the chest by shrapnel -- one of the many children killed in the conflict			0
she said it was important to share his story and images			0
" that little baby is one of two children who died today , " @entity212 said			0
" that baby probably will move more people to think , what is going on , and why is no one stopping this murder in @entity80 that is happening every day ? " @entity0 's @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 contributed to this report .			2
