-- get ready to hear that voice , hear that sound -- like thunder gon na shake the ground			0
confirming rumors that had been around at least since last month , the @entity5 said sunday that @entity7 will headline the next @entity9 halftime show			1
following in the show - stopping dance steps of @entity11 from this year might be a tall order			2
but @entity13 says she 's already planning her own fireworks			1
" i 've got some insane ideas this year , " she said in a video posted soon after the announcement			0
" what if we covered the stadium with glitter ? " but the glitter ... was edible			0
" last month , @entity25 's @entity24 and @entity26 reported that @entity13 was preparing to shine at @entity27 , set for february 1 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
it 's not hard to see why the @entity5 would want to pursue @entity13			1
here are three reasons why we think she 'll kill it			0
she 's got energetic , exuberant pop @entity7 's music is essentially the stuff @entity9 halftime dreams are made of			1
much of her catalog is high - energy , danceable pop that 's just cheeky enough to be entertaining without losing a sponsorship			0
and she has a backlog of hits to choose from : there 's " birthday " and " @entity51 " from her 2013 release " @entity49 , " plus older but still - in - rotation tracks like " firework , " " @entity55 , " " @entity56 " and " @entity52			0
everyone from your grandma to your 3 - year - old nephew knows her music in 2011 , @entity7 tied with @entity62 -- not bad company -- with five no. 1 singles from the same album			2
you do n't accomplish that without some serious fan power , young and old			0
and when we say young , we mean young : " @entity70 " has been known to soothe at least one baby			0
she gives a show - stopping performance one of the things critics took away from @entity13 's 2012 concert documentary , " @entity75 , " is just how much work goes into a @entity13 performance			1
from the costumes to the set pieces , @entity13 creates her own whimsical wonderland -- as anyone who 's seen one of her videos can attest			2
we can only imagine the kind of creation that would accompany a @entity9 halftime show			1
@entity7 : ' most rewarded digital act ' beats @entity89 , @entity90 by millions			2

@entity7 will headline the next @entity9 halftime show
@entity13 says she 's already planning her own fireworks
it 's not hard to imagine why she *'d* be a great *selection* for the program
