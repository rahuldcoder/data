@entity0 -- as president @entity3 decides whether to strike @entity4 inside @entity5 , he has political considerations as well			1
@entity8 lawmakers are watching critically as @entity3 weighs options on how to deal with the threat from @entity4 , the @entity11 in @entity12 and @entity5			1
many have argued the surge of @entity4 is the direct result of lack of strategic action to date from @entity3 , while others are questioning how broadly @entity3 's executive authority extends when it comes to taking militarily action			1
rep. @entity22 , the top @entity23 on the @entity24 , tells @entity1 that unless the @entity8 or its citizens face an imminent threat from @entity4 , @entity3 must seek approval from @entity28 before extended airstrikes against @entity4 inside @entity5			1
" i do think the president should come to @entity28 if he intends to embark on airstrikes in @entity5 for the purpose of trying to defeat @entity4 , " @entity22 said saturday			1
" if we 're talking about the same kind of more general airstrikes we 're undertaking in @entity12 , that 's something that would broaden the mission significantly			0
and , frankly , i think the case has n't been made for that yet			0
" rep. @entity40 , chairman of the @entity41 and a @entity42 from @entity43 , told @entity1 that he 'd support the use of armed drones on @entity4 in @entity5			1
" i think strikes at this point , against the @entity5 @entity4 , which has bled into @entity12 , those steps should be taken , " @entity40 said			1
" had they been taken some time ago , i think @entity4 would not have as much influence on the ground as it has now			1
" @entity52 : ' unspeakable ' suffering in @entity12 town besieged by @entity4 fighters @entity40 said he would not , however , support putting @entity8 troops on the ground			1
" there is no support in the @entity8 on either side of the aisle for introducing ground troops there , " @entity40 said			0
" the question is : do we support the @entity64 ? do we support the @entity65 in their effort to turn back @entity4 ? and in doing that , we need to give them the heavy equipment such as anti-tank missiles that desperately they need			1
" " the most important aspect of this is that this needs to be a dialogue between @entity28 and the administration in terms of having a strategic plan forward in supporting the @entity64 forces on the ground , " said @entity40			0
" that 's the infantry that is right now advancing against @entity4 , and they need the support			1
" @entity83 piles on president @entity83 gov. @entity83 of @entity85 tied the @entity4 threat into a broader critique of six years of the @entity3 doctrine			2
" when we think about where we are in the international scene , we think about the lack of leadership , " @entity83 said			0
" when we see what 's happened in @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity5 , @entity98 and now back in @entity12 that we were told three years ago was secure and @entity99 was on the run and we see the enemy that we are having to deal with			2
" @entity83 , who is considering a bid for the @entity42 nomination in 2016 , made the remarks at a rally for @entity108 @entity42 activists			0
the @entity8 on saturay carried out another airstrike in near the strategically important @entity110 in @entity12 , according to the @entity111			0
it 's the 62nd such strike in support of @entity64 forces fighting for control of the dam and the 94th of the campaign against @entity4 , which began august 8 and has included daily strikes			2
@entity8 intelligence agencies are gathering information on the locations of @entity4 leadership and troops in @entity5 , two @entity8 officials have told @entity1			1
separately , @entity8 officials said the military has been talking about increasing airstrikes in @entity12 and possibly carrying out tailored airstrikes inside @entity5 against @entity4 targets			1
defense secretary @entity129 and @entity131 chairman @entity130 signaled the @entity8 was gearing up for a significant change both in rhetoric and action regarding @entity4 in @entity5			1
" can [ @entity4 ] be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in @entity5 ? the answer is no , " @entity130 told reporters thursday			1
" that will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border			0
and that will come when we have a coalition in the region that takes on the task of defeating @entity4 over time			2
" @entity150 , a @entity1 national security analyst who has researched terror groups for decades , said it will be difficult to defeat @entity4 without ground forces			2
' what does day two look like ? ' but @entity8 's gloomy feelings of war fatigue will make consensus building for action in @entity5 a difficult sell			2
" president @entity3 has been very reluctant to get involved in @entity5 because what does day two look like ? " @entity150 said			2
" two of the most effective fighting forces in @entity5 are @entity99 or @entity99 splinter groups , or groups like @entity165 , backed by @entity166			2
so if you intervene , you may be helping @entity166 and @entity165 and [ @entity5 president @entity169 's ] regime			0
" @entity40 told @entity1 , however , that there are groups in @entity5 with which the @entity8 can align			0
" we should be arming the @entity65 , " @entity40 said			0
" it was the opposition to @entity169			0
it was clear that @entity4 in a vacuum would move into that position			0
that 's what we have seen happen			0
" adding another layer to the political and security calculus for the @entity182 , intervention in @entity5 is more complicated than the ongoing airstrikes in @entity12 due to international law , @entity150 said			1
" you could imagine some combination of @entity188 in small numbers , drone strikes , and airstrikes in @entity5 just as has been taking place in @entity12			0
but it 's a pretty big bridge to cross , " @entity150 said			0
" the @entity12 government is inviting us to do these strikes in @entity12			0
the @entity5 government certainly would n't be inviting us to intervene militarily in @entity5			0
so there 's a good question of international law , which after all the administration and the @entity8 has good reasons to uphold			1

administration considers hitting @entity4 targets in @entity5
but there are political , international law questions
and intervention could have other effects
