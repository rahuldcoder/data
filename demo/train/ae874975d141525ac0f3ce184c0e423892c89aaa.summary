any employee who leaves before december would not be able to collect the company 's match			1
workers at @entity1 are n't marching to the picket line like @entity14 workers and longshoreman who protest pay and working conditions , but you just never know			1
only about 9 % of the nation 's employers make matches once a year			0
@entity1 's move is paving the way for big companies to go down this road			1
if i were an @entity1 manager , i would love this once - a - year lump payment			1
first , my buddies in @entity29 would have much less hassle with fewer deposits to make			0
by delaying payment to the end of the year , " the float " -- interest accrued -- would go to the company instead of the workers			1
in other words , the company saves money			0
moreover , few @entity1 workers are going to voluntarily leave before december , which means projects can be planned better and employees can be asked to do more			1
quiz : the ultimate portfolio -- 15 questions to help you define your financial goals a few years ago , in 2008 , @entity1 made news by transforming its traditional defined benefit plan , a pension , into a 401 ( k ) - type plan			1
that move saved money , but the company lost an important personnel tool			0
defined benefit plans are designed to encourage employees to exit or retire when it is optimal for the company			1
a 401 ( k ) is cheaper , but it is a " cash and carry " account that does not have the element of timing finesse			0
a 401 ( k ) plan does not reward loyalty , and its value is not predictable as it fluctuates all over the place depending on the financial markets			2
by making workers stay until december before they can receive the company 's 401 ( k ) match , @entity1 is putting back , albeit with an anemic substitute , a reward for workers to stay at least until december			1
the company can be pretty sure that there will be very few workers exiting during crunch time season : september , october and november			2
it would really be @entity1 's choice in determining which employees to let go			1
this incremental addition to @entity1 's control over their employees is surely the main reason @entity1 changed its 401 ( k ) payment timing			1
but let 's step back			0
relative to other companies , @entity1 actually has a good retirement plan			1
it matches more than 6 % of a worker 's contribution , which is above the national average			0
only 7 % of companies do not make matches to 401 ( k ) plans , so at least @entity1 is , for now , in the majority of companies that match their employees ' contributions			1
not many people know that just because a company sponsors a 401 ( k ) plan does n't mean that it will pay a cent			2
in the great recession of 2008 to 2009 , more than 11 % of companies stopped their 401 ( k ) match			2
because they are voluntary , most workers do not even have a retirement account plan , which means many middle - class and upper - middle - class workers will only have @entity112 to rely on for retirement			2
these workers face considerable chance of downward mobility later in life because @entity112 is not designed to replace pre-retirement living standards for anyone but the lowest paid workers			0
middle - class workers will need at least a $ 500,000 payout on top of @entity112 checks to have a chance of remaining middle class when they retire			0
most of us could only dream of accumulating that amount or its equivalent by saving for retirement at work or being in a pension plan			2
@entity1 looks better than most companies because most companies are whacking their workers ' retirement plans or do n't sponsor any at all			1
@entity137 offered its salaried , white - collar workers a lump sum -- the worst way to get a retirement account because people spend a lump sum too fast -- instead of an annuity			2
@entity145 will follow @entity137 's example next year			0
fortunately , very few auto managers and workers are taking up such an offer ; they must know an annuity is more valuable			0
what is there to stop companies from ending retirement accounts altogether ? nothing			2
unions represent less than 11 % of the private sector workforce and the unemployment rate is high enough that anyone who has a job feels lucky to have a job			0
i do n't see anything on the horizon that will encourage companies to maintain or improve retirement programs at the workplace			0
political leadership and bravery is needed to call out the failure of the voluntary retirement system and to secure retirement income and savings for all @entity4 workers			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

@entity1 said it would contribute once every december to its employees ' 401 ( k ) plans
@entity177 : this type of payment benefits the company rather than workers
she says relative to other companies , @entity1 actually has a good retirement plan
@entity177 : most companies are reducing retirement benefits ; workers lose
