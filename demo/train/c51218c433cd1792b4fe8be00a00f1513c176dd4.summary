-- in @entity3 professional sports , you can name a team almost anything			1
you can give the team a ferocious name ( @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 )			2
you can go for a swashbuckling image ( @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 )			0
colors are all right for a team name ( @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 )			2
birds ( @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 )			0
you can sound regal ( @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 )			0
aeronautic themes work ( @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 )			0
religious imagery ( @entity36 , @entity37 )			0
even insects ( @entity38 )			0
there are some names -- and mascots and logos associated with them -- that have become controversial , but that are still used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47			0
but i have been talking with sports experts and sports - marketing specialists , and they are in agreement that there is one name -- a name that used to belong to a famed big - league baseball team -- that would be met with such antipathy by @entity3 's fans that no team today would even think of using it			1
i refer , of course , to the @entity60			1
" not a chance , " said @entity61 , former executive editor of @entity62 and editor of sports books including " @entity62 's @entity65 " and the baseball anthology " @entity67			2
" the @entity60 were a charter member of the @entity70 , and were around , in one form or another , from 1901 until 1972			1
for a lot of that time they were a terrible baseball team -- they were derided with a popular saying : " first in war , first in peace , last in the @entity70			1
" but although the team was lousy , no one minded the name			2
" people associated ' @entity60 ' with something revered , something held in high regard , " @entity61 said			1
" the team was n't distinguished , but the name was			2
" now ? with polls showing that the approval rating for @entity86 is minuscule ( around 15 % in many polls , 12 % in a recent @entity93 / @entity92 poll ) , " no marketing person in his right mind would name a team the @entity60 , " @entity61 said			1
indeed , when , after 33 years without a big - league baseball team , @entity94 was awarded one for the 2005 season , the owners , probably wisely , went with @entity98 , not senators , for a name			1
" you need a name that has a chance to be loveable , " @entity61 said			0
" that leaves ' @entity60 ' out			1
" that 's an awfully melancholy commentary on the current state of our public attitudes			2
yet purely as a business decision , calling any new big - league sports team the @entity60 would be seen as ill - advised			1
@entity112 , the @entity114 pitcher who broke into the major leagues in 1965 , when baseball 's senators were still playing in @entity94 , said last week : " i do n't think that any team today would choose to call itself the @entity60 because of all of the controversy in @entity94			1
i believe that people would think that the name was too political			0
" indeed , today 's poisonous political environment is the main reason that what was once a perfectly good sports - team name would be a nonstarter now			1
sports historian @entity127 , author of the forthcoming " @entity128 : the @entity129 , @entity130 , and the @entity131 , " said : " the term ' senator ' once sounded much more austere			0
the country felt differently about @entity94			0
my father said that when men and women would go to the movies , and the newsreel came on and @entity142 would appear , the people in the theater would cheer			2
" @entity127 recalls hearing an older @entity3 proudly " tell a story about how , as a boy , he memorized the names of all the senators			1
" but i just do n't think you could use that name for a team now			0
it would be a punch line			0
something that @entity154 would make jokes about every night			0
" in @entity158 , a country that may have a more tolerant attitude toward the machinations of government , the professional hockey team in @entity157 was named the senators early in the 20th century , and , as a member of the @entity164 , still is			0
and in @entity166 , @entity167 , the minor - league baseball team was christened the @entity60 in 1894 , and continues with the tradition of the name			1
but in the multi-billion - dollar , high - stakes world of @entity3 major - league sports -- and even at major @entity3 colleges -- it would doubtless be seen as foolhardy to take a chance on using that name			1
" now that the approval ratings for @entity86 are within the margin of error for ax murderers , it is inconceivable , " said @entity176 , who traveled the country for decades covering all the major sports for newspapers in @entity180 and @entity181 , and who is the editor of a forthcoming anthology of the greatest sports columns in the history of @entity181 newspapers			0
" some of us remember the @entity60 , " he said , " but if someone proposed calling a team the @entity60 today , young people would scratch their heads and think : ' what a strange choice			1
' " the current turmoil in @entity94 likely has n't helped matters			0
@entity201 , president of @entity202 , a company that arranges baseball fantasy camps featuring former big - leaguers and organizes appearances by retired players , said he would worry about the emotional well - being of athletes compelled to wear the uniforms of such a team			0
" players having to take the field with the word ' @entity60 ' stitched in big letters across the front ? " he said			1
" can you imagine the kinds of things the fans would be yelling at them ? " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			2

in the @entity3 , you can name a team almost anything , says @entity221
the one *certainty* is that no one will call a major league team " the @entity60 , " he says
@entity221 says @entity60 , once in the @entity70 , came from *simpler* time
today 's politicians are so *disliked* that no one would cheer for them , he says
