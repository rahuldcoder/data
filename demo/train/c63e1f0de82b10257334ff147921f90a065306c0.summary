-- the onlookers yell out at police and talk passionately with each other , their anger mixed with disbelief			1
at one point , a siren breaks through the murmurs and the shouts			0
in front of them is a young black man , his body prone and alone on the pavement			1
it 's all in a video , captured saturday and posted to @entity17 a day later , that shows the tense , chilling scene on an otherwise placid summer day in @entity20 , @entity21			1
it 's broad daylight ; the grass is green ; the trees are in full bloom			0
one woman heard on the video recalls having been in the shower when she heard pops			0
could it have been fireworks ? " not this time of the day , " says a male voice , apparently from the person who shot the video on a cell phone			1
" there ai n't no fireworks this early			0
" those lined up outside the yellow police tape waste no time discussing , often in expletive - laden terms , what happened			1
and the video dutifully records it all			0
it 's not clear who saw what or what exactly transpired			0
regardless , a clear consensus emerges among those heard on the recording : the young man in the street -- later @entity54 'd as @entity55 , an 18 - year - old days away from starting classes at a technical college -- was shot dead by a @entity20 police officer			1
authorities would later claim @entity55 attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun			2
but in the minutes after the shooting , the irate crowd on the @entity20 street comes to a different consensus , summed up by the video 's narrator : " they just killed this ( man ) for no reason			1
" as @entity55 's body lay prone -- for minutes with no one , not even a police officer , in the camera 's sight -- onlookers quickly establish one key fact amongst themselves : he was n't armed			1
" there is nothing ! " a woman yells out on the video			0
" do you see a gun ? do you see a knife ? do you see anything that would have caused a threat to these ( expletive ) police officers ? " " they shot that boy because they wanted to shoot that boy			2
" if the moments leading up to @entity55 's shooting were frenetic , the moments afterward -- at least right around his body -- are eerily calm as captured on the continuing video			1
5 things to know about @entity55 's shooting for minutes , there is nothing and no one around his body			1
just a young man with a white shirt flat on the street , all alone			0
a police officer walks by two minutes into the video , and a minute later a man in a black shirt -- who witnesses identify as a family member -- approaches			2
but he 's quickly guided away by officers			0
a short time later , a uniformed man -- perhaps a paramedic -- appears to check on @entity55			2
multiple officers eventually flank his body			0
one particularly angry , loud woman cries out : " where 's the ambulance ? why does n't somebody help this man ? why is n't somebody helping him ? " to which a man responds , more quietly , to no one in particular : " they know he 's dead , because they are not even trying to get him up			2
" everything about @entity55 is plain to see			2
until 10 minutes in , when a police officer comes up to lay a small white sheet over his body			1
as the video ends , it is only the beginning in @entity20			0
complete coverage on the @entity20 shooting @entity0 's @entity137 contributed to this report .			0

a video shows onlookers outside police tape after @entity55 is shot dead
his body lays prone on the ground , *largely* alone , until a white sheet is put on it
crowd sees he 's *unarmed* ; many conclude the teen was shot " for no *...* reason "
