-- @entity2 ' @entity1 believes that i , as an @entity4 - @entity3 , should have fewer constitutional rights simply because of my religious faith			1
@entity1 , the so - called " liberal " on @entity2 , made this point on his show this week while discussing the horrific terror attack on the @entity13 shopping mall			1
@entity1 opined that @entity3 should not be allowed to build any more houses of worship in @entity4 , " until you stand up and denounce what 's happened in the name of your prophet			1
" sorry @entity1 , you 're dead wrong			0
if you would take a moment to read our amazing @entity4 @entity21 , you would perhaps understand the rights we are all guaranteed as @entity4 , such as freedom of religion			2
but when you hear @entity1 speak , you get the sense he is n't a big fan of reading			2
let me address this to @entity1 : i have never built a mosque , nor do i have plans to			0
but if i wanted to build one , i could build one right next to your house			0
in fact , i almost want to start a fundraising campaign on @entity36 entitled : " raise money to build a mega-mosque next to @entity1 's house			2
" this is not the first time @entity1 has spewed this type of hateful garbage			0
this past july he demanded that @entity3 - @entity4 be prohibited from building houses of worship , " until we find out who 's a terrorist " within the @entity4 @entity3 community			1
i 'm curious : @entity48 truly believes what he says about @entity3 or is he simply giving the @entity2 audience what it wants to hear ? after all , a 2011 survey concluded , " that @entity4 who most trust @entity2 are more likely to believe that @entity3 want to establish @entity55 law , have not done enough to oppose extremism , and believe investigating @entity3 extremism is a good idea			2
" here 's a news flash for @entity1 : just because a person claims to be a muslim , does n't mean his or her actions are based on the tenets of the faith , nor does it mean this person is an actual muslim			1
just look at the @entity13 shopping mall attack			0
the terrorists there did n't say they carried out their attack for religious reasons			0
no , they made it clear the attack was revenge for the @entity13 government sending its troops to fight them in @entity79			2
so let 's get to the crux of the issue : should @entity4 - @entity3 be required to denounce terrorist attacks perpetrated by so - called @entity3 who commit horrible acts on other parts of the planet ? well , let 's ask @entity88 : " we must reject the idea that every ( time ) a law is broken , society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker			1
it is time to restore the @entity4 precept that each individual is accountable for his actions			0
" still , @entity4 @entity3 leaders and organizations have consistently denounced terror attacks committed by @entity3 -- including the recent @entity13 attack			1
and not only did @entity4 @entity3 denounce this recent incident , so did @entity3 leaders in @entity13 as well as the president of @entity79 -- a @entity3			1
how could @entity1 not be aware of these facts ? maybe he has n't figured out how to use @entity105 yet ? or maybe he simply does n't care about accuracy -- or both ? and why would beckel and his @entity2 show have a discussion about @entity3 without inviting at least one on ? do they not know even one @entity110 ? or is the reason more sinister ? does @entity2 not want a @entity110 on air to denounce the terror acts and present an @entity4 face of the faith because it undermines the narrative they have crafted about @entity3 over the past few years ? you will have to answer that			1
but i can tell you this : i personally wanted to get on @entity1 's @entity2 show to answer their questions and discuss a recently released comedy documentary i co-directed , " the @entity3 are coming ! " this film addresses the very point they are raising and uses comedy to dispel misconceptions about @entity3			1
but they said " no. " so i will say it here : i absolutely despise the terrorists who kill innocent people -- be they @entity3 or any other faith for that matter			0
they use the name of religion to justify an immoral and inhumane act			0
and the ones who claim to be @entity3 are not -- they are simply murderers			0
i still hold out hope that one day @entity2 will invite more @entity110 on its network so that their audience can hear from @entity3 first hand			1
my concern , though , is that day will only come when @entity2 has moved on to demonizing another minority group for ratings			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			0

@entity150 : @entity2 's @entity1 said no new mosques in @entity4 till @entity3 denounce terrorists
@entity150 : does @entity1 say these things to be @entity2 - like ?
he says news flash : @entity13 attacks about revenge against @entity13 government , not religion
@entity150 : @entity2 does n't have @entity110 on air to conflict with network 's narrative
