" @entity1 gov. @entity76 echoed @entity57 's sentiments			0
" everyone heals , some slower , some in different ways , some wanted this theater to reopen , some did n't , " @entity76 said			0
" for many here tonight , this is the path to healing and part of that process			2
for everyone here , i think i speak for the entire state that we remain here for you , for the entire community of @entity58			2

" i feel like i 'm a different person for coming , and that brings about some healing , " said @entity106 , who was shot in the arm in the attack			0
" and just like with my arm , it 's going to take some time to heal			0
" @entity113 , the chief executive officer of @entity38 , which is facing lawsuits from several victims ' families and survivors , praised the city for its resilience and thanked the first responders who assisted the victims			0
