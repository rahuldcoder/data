-- @entity1 pulled off one of the big upsets of the @entity3 by beating @entity4 by two wickets in a thrilling @entity7 match at @entity8 on friday			1
the co-hosts kept alive their hopes of qualifying for the quarterfinals and left @entity4 in danger of crashing out of the tournament following a second defeat in five matches			2
the @entity16 must now win their final game next thursday against the @entity18 , who earlier survived a scare before beating @entity21 and have an extra game to play against unbeaten @entity23			1
@entity1 also have two matches left , against fellow minnows the @entity26 on monday and then heavyweights @entity27 on march 19 , and will qualify in the top four with wins in both			2
@entity4 posted a disappointing total of 225 , being bowled out in the final of the allotted 50 overs as @entity32 , @entity33 and captain @entity34 took two wickets each			0
@entity35 top - scored with 67 while @entity38 , playing his first match since replacing the injured @entity37 , contributed 63			0
@entity1 had been bowled out for 58 by the @entity18 last friday , but appeared to be cruising to a famous victory at 155 - 3 in the 31st over			1
however , opening batsman @entity41 was needlessly run out for 60 , @entity34 ( 32 ) dragged a delivery from spinner @entity43 onto his stumps , then seam bowler @entity40 dismissed @entity45 and @entity46 ( 0 )			0
@entity47 fell to @entity43 three runs later at 169 - 8 , but @entity49 joined @entity50 and gave @entity1 hope			2
@entity46 hit four fours and a six as he scored 24 off as many balls faced , while @entity50 made a dogged 21 off 42			0
the tide turned in the 46th over when @entity4 swing bowler @entity57 conceded 11 runs , including seven wides			2
@entity46 then hit two boundaries in @entity62 's next over to bring the target down to 12 runs from 18 balls , and @entity50 hit the same bowler to the boundary with the last delivery of the 49th to give @entity1 a second win in 15 meetings with the three - time @entity73 runners - up			1
" i thought @entity50 and @entity49 batted exceptionally well			0
at one stage we thought we 'd lost the game but they showed their character , how tough they are and how hard - working , " @entity34 told @entity74			0
@entity21 also beat @entity4 earlier this month , and had been on target to follow that up with a win over the @entity18 at @entity84 until a controversial umpiring decision turned the game			1
the @entity18 had posted a total of 275 as opener @entity88 scored his first century in one - day internationals , going on to make 107 , and all - rounder @entity91 smashed 94 off 55 balls -- hitting eight fours and five sixes			1
@entity91 also pulled off a fine catch to dismiss dangerman @entity96 , @entity21 's match - winner against @entity4 , but the @entity98 needed just 76 runs to win off the last nine overs with half their wickets remaining when @entity102 was given out for 61			1
@entity104 umpire @entity103 ruled that @entity102 had been trapped leg before wicket by @entity107 , and the batsman 's call for a second review was unsuccessful even though it appeared that he should not have been given out			0
@entity21 then lost their last four wickets cheaply as left - arm spinner @entity112 finished with 4 - 53 alongside @entity107 's earlier three strikes as the @entity18 moved up to second place , a point above @entity4			1
in saturday 's only game , @entity23 face @entity27 in @entity117 , while sunday sees @entity7 matches between @entity119 and @entity120 , then @entity121 and @entity122 .			0
