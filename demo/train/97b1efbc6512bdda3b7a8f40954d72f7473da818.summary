@entity0 -- i bet it sounded like a good idea at the time			0
now , not so much			0
" it " was the ill - conceived decision by @entity7 presidential hopeful @entity6 to hitch his wagon to the clownish @entity10 sheriff @entity9 , an opportunist who in recent years has taken to rounding up illegal immigrants and parading them outside his jail to catch the attention of television cameras			1
how did @entity6 get mixed up with that circus ? simple			1
the @entity17 governor got into a political scrape , and made the mistake of overcompensating			0
he was looking for quick validation from his party 's nativist fringe because he had gotten hammered by @entity7 rivals for signing , in 2001 , a reasonable bill in the @entity17 that allows illegal immigrants who go to college to pay what other residents pay : in - state tuition			1
in fact , @entity6 did n't just sign that bill			2
he defended it and defiantly said he 'd sign it again			0
worse , in one debate , he told @entity7 who disagreed with the measure that they did n't " have a heart			0
yet , after that , his poll numbers plummeted			0
in a futile attempt to get them up again , @entity6 underwent a radical makeover			2
he said that , if elected president , " my policy will be to detain and to deport every illegal alien that we apprehend			0
" ah , governor , you mean the ones you 're not helping put through college ? @entity6 even did penance by making a pilgrimage to the desert where he asked @entity9 for his support			1
just a few weeks ago , @entity9 announced he was endorsing @entity55 and he even went to @entity56 to help him campaign			2
" the federal government has failed on border crime and border enforcement , and no candidate for president has done more to secure the border than governor @entity6 , " @entity9 said in a statement			1
" i 'm endorsing @entity6 because we need a tough - on - crime president who will champion and fund full - time border security operations from @entity69 to @entity0			1
" now , @entity72 's toughest sheriff is busy fending off allegations of discrimination and racial profiling			1
such is the result of a three - year investigation by the @entity72 @entity78 into @entity9 and the @entity79			1
at issue : their clumsy handling of something they never had the know - how or skills set to do : immigration enforcement			0
the @entity78 's report packed a punch			1
it accused @entity9 's office of maintaining a " pervasive culture of discriminatory bias against @entity93 " that " reaches the highest levels of the agency			1
" it accused the sheriff 's deputies of routinely engaging in " unconstitutional policing " that includes racially profiling @entity102 drivers , illegally detaining and arresting @entity93 and carrying out military - style immigration patrols sparked by racially tinged citizen complaints			1
it said that inmates in the county jails who do n't speak @entity109 are often punished and denied critical services			0
finally , it also charged that the leaders of the agency have an odious practice of using their power to retaliate against critics			0
none of this will come as a shock to @entity121 's growing @entity102 population , which has been complaining of abuse by @entity9 and his deputies for several years			1
following the report 's release , the @entity124 immediately terminated its 287 ( g ) agreement with the @entity79 and denied it access to the federal databases that it is practically forcing upon other agencies to locate illegal immigrants under the controversial @entity133 program			0
as someone who lived in @entity135 in the late 1990s and wrote columns for the @entity138 newspaper , i 've known @entity9 and written about him for nearly 15 years			2
i prefer the original version			0
back then , the sheriff said that his office should not waste limited resources enforcing federal immigration law			0
by contrast , @entity9 2.0 seems to take shortcuts that run afoul of the @entity147			2
just because a media hungry lawman is hunting for illegal immigrants does n't mean he can single out @entity93 -- including the @entity72 - born , some of whose families have lived on this side of the border much longer than @entity9 's ancestors have lived on this side of the @entity155			1
next , @entity78 officials will try to strike an agreement with @entity9 to implement a plan that fixes what is broken , one that can be enforced by a judge			1
the officials are giving the @entity79 60 days to come up with a solution or face litigation			0
those who defend @entity9 and brush aside concerns over racial profiling will likely say that it 's appropriate for law enforcement officers to put extra scrutiny on @entity93 since most illegal immigrants in the @entity72 are @entity102			1
the last statement is true enough			0
but just because most illegal immigrants are @entity102 does n't mean that most @entity93 are illegal immigrants			0
besides , the opponents of illegal immigration always want to convince us that they 're colorblind			0
that argument gets hard to make when the apologists for racial profiling start defending the idea of singling out people of one ethnicity			1
so what did @entity6 do when the @entity78 report came out ? the worst possible thing			1
he doubled down on his bad judgment			0
he had already made two mistakes in snuggling up to @entity9 and accepting his endorsement			2
he went for three by defending @entity9			2
" i would suggest to you that these people are out after @entity9 , " @entity6 told reporters			1
and again , when i 'm the president of the @entity72 , you 're not going to see me going after states like @entity10 or @entity193 , suing sovereign states for making decisions			2
" even if those decisions are bad ? this is not a good sign for @entity6			2
we need a president who has character and courage , and he showed both of those qualities early in this campaign			0
but we also need a president with judgment , and the ability to stop and change course when they take a wrong turn			0
for @entity6 , that wrong turn occurred in the @entity10 desert , near the intersection of ambition and fear			1
and now a once - promising candidate has lost his bearings			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220			2

@entity220 : @entity6 has hitched his wagon to @entity10 sheriff @entity9
@entity6 was *foolishly* looking for quick validation from his party 's nativist fringe , @entity220 says
@entity78 has accused @entity9 of discrimination and racial profiling , he says
a once - promising candidate has lost his bearings , @entity220 says of @entity6
