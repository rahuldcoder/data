-- it is 5:00am on sunday morning in @entity2 , @entity3			2
@entity4 has yet to break here but preparations are already under way for the afternoon 's @entity9 race			1
a golden glow of light pools from a hair salon in the west of the city ; inside the @entity16 girls -- named after the @entity16 track where the @entity18 @entity17 is staged - are being preened and coiffed for their big day			1
the young women share the grid with some of the sport 's biggest names but while @entity26 's four - time world champion @entity25 was still getting his beauty sleep the @entity16 girls are already at work			1
" i 've been waking up at about four o'clock in the morning , " explains @entity29 , a first time @entity16 girl and the troop 's only redhead			2
" the drivers probably get to sleep in and wait for their crew to get their stuff together			2
" but it 's worth it -- beauty is pain ! " there is a happy chatter at this pre-dawn pampering party for the 31 young women selected to be @entity16 girls for the 2013 @entity18 @entity17			1
center stage despite the early start , the overwhelming feeling is one of excitement at sharing center stage at a prestigious international event that is watched by half a billion viewers around the globe			2
" what 's it like being a grid girl ? " 24 - year - old @entity55 , who is a photographer by trade , ponders			1
" get ready for an almost paparazzi style feel to it ! you walk out and you instantly have cameras taking pictures of you and video cameras filming you			2
" you 're just ' wow , this is amazing ! ' you feel the energy of the people , the crowd and how excited they are			2
it 's a wonderful feeling to be part of this			1
" grid girls -- also known as paddock girls or brolly dollies -- have been part of motorsport 's glamorous panoply for the last 40 years			1
sponsor driven they arrived in @entity9 following the advent of sponsorship and advertising in the late 1960s and soon became a popular promotional asset for the sport			1
their duties include displaying the race number placards on the grid , clapping the drivers onto the podium , making appearances in vip suites and taking part in photo sessions with the fans			1
the girls are not allowed to talk to the drivers unless they are spoken to first and there 's an even stricter rule imposed by the @entity16 girls ' manager @entity102 , a former @entity104 cheerleader			1
" one of my very , very strict policies is that in a non-working situation the girls may not interact with the race car drivers , " @entity102 explained to @entity0			1
" however , in a working situation they have to be cordial and that 's it			2
" @entity16 girl @entity113 illuminates further : " last year i was the grid girl for @entity114			1
i think he said hello - but he was getting in the zone			2
" do the young women see themselves as playing the glamorous figures in a man 's world ? tough selection " no , not at all , " says @entity55			1
" we are very well versed			2
we went through a series of interviews before we even got this job			1
" we have no problem conversing with people and being personable instead of just standing there and looking pretty as a picture			2
" ditto and the circuit 's marketing manager @entity131 are intent on cultivating a sense of empowerment within their brood of @entity16 girls			1
good looks are only part of the selection criteria			1
the applicants -- there were 250 this season with some even applying from @entity144 and @entity145 -- go through a three - stage interview process			1
" i actually got asked how much i could bench press in my interview , " laughs @entity147 , a sports trainer , saleswoman and architect -- as well as a repeat @entity16 girl			0
ditto jokes that she plays the role of picky @entity156 judge @entity155 on the selection panel			0
cross section she is looking for well - rounded young women who can represent the modern @entity18 sweetheart in @entity9 's global community			1
" we have the cross section of the @entity18 woman , " @entity102 , an attractive blond , explains			0
" i 'm not looking for a stereotypical , 5 " 10 blonde model			0
we have @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity171 - @entity18 girls			1
we 're not looking for a maximum age , we actually have one @entity16 girl who is 38			0
" it 's not just about the looks department either , it 's a lot more than that			0
we are looking for the all - american woman who is poised , attractive and confident , a great communicator and who can be a @entity16 ambassador			0
" although the role of a @entity16 girl comes with a salary and a year - long contract , the women also hold down full - time jobs or are in college			1
learning curve being a @entity16 girl is an exciting break from the norm but for some it is also a useful learning curve			0
" i 'm in school right now for radio and television , " explains @entity194 , a 19 - year - old from @entity196			0
" i want to be a sports reporter or an anchor woman so this is really good for me			0
" it teaches me how to handle myself in environments when i might feel overwhelmed , how to communicate with people from different parts of the world			1
" it gives me a feel of what i might be doing if i am a sports reporter one day			0
" ditto hopes that the experience of being a @entity16 girl will , above all , be a stepping - stone for the young women in their future careers			0
" coming from the @entity104 taught me a lot , " she adds			0
" it gave me the background that i need to pass on to these girls and get them ready for life skills , not just here at the track			1
eye candy ? " i want them to hold themselves high and be confident because self confidence is the key to everything			0
" the experience of being a @entity16 girl may well be empowering but that does not stop everyone from viewing them as eye candy			0
the girls concede attention from arduous admirers comes with the territory			1
" yes , it happens , " says @entity147			0
" we 're always very polite but also very modest about the situation and just keep moving on ... ' thank for the compliment , that 's very nice of you to say			0
' " ditto is also on hand to make sure the girls are not put in any situations they do not feel comfortable with			1
" the girls are always being hit on , " she says			1
" it 's just the nature of the beast but we want them to be at ease with everything that they do			0
" if i walk in the door and it 's all alcohol , all men ; a bunch of people just carrying on , i probably will just skip that suite or i 'll just tell the girls ' just keep a smile on your face , say hello and we 'll quickly excuse ourselves			2
' " i have to be the bad cop			0
if the environment goes sour then we quickly assess the situation and get out of there			0
" @entity18 sweetheart it may be less than sweet but for now being an @entity18 sweetheart is not a job for the boys			2
grid boys have made rare appearances in @entity9 , for example at the @entity281 in @entity282 , but there are no plans for cowboys to giddy up on the @entity3 grid			1
" i have n't had any [ men ] apply , " says @entity102 , when asked why there are n't any @entity16 boys			0
" i do n't think it 's sexist but i have to be really , really careful because that 's a good question			0
" i would say in different parts of the world that would be totally acceptable , i just ca n't see that being welcomed here because we are so used to seeing beautiful @entity3 women			2
i think it 's cultural for sure			0
" @entity299 - boy girls @entity113 , who is also the circuit 's official dj , has her own theory : " we 're kind of tom - boy girls			2
" @entity147 agrees : " we recently worked at an event where we were able to race go - karts round the track			0
" i was so mad because i was in first place for the longest time and then i got passed by some man at the end			0
i was so ticked off , i got second place			0
" so , the @entity16 girls definitely do not see themselves as second best in a man 's world ? " never ! " exclaims @entity113			1
" we 're always representing girl power			0
" girl power just needs a little extra preening and with that it is back to business at the early bird hair salon to " fluff and puff " their @entity3 style .			0
