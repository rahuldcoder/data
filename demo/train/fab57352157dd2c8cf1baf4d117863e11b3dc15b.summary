@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 enlisted in the @entity4 28 years ago , but he 's facing his greatest battle now that he 's out			1
retired veteran @entity3 is so weakened by @entity6 that he often ca n't catch himself when he slips			1
@entity3 spends most of his days in his small apartment in @entity0 , @entity1 , reading on his couch , and working at his computer			1
he leaves only when it is absolutely necessary ; the trek down the three flights of stairs is exhausting and dangerous			2
he slips easily , and he does not have the strength to catch himself			0
@entity3 suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , als , also known as @entity17 's disease , after the legendary baseball star who lent his name to the mysterious illness over 60 years ago			1
his doctors have told him to stop working but he can not afford to , so he works when his body will let him			0
he is able to work from home most days -- he 's a community relations officer , command speechwriter and medical publications reviewer based at @entity27			0
but as typing becomes an increasingly strenuous chore , even this will become too much to bear			0
@entity3 hopes this day comes later rather than sooner			1
sitting idly is not is his nature , but ever so slightly , that is changing			0
" this is a disease where ... one day you wake up and you can walk , and the next day you ca n't , " he says			2
" and once you lose it , you can never get it back			0
" @entity6 is a progressive disease that attacks neurons in the brain , eventually leading to total paralysis			1
it affects 20,000 to 30,000 americans at any given time , according to the @entity43			1
it can take up to 10 years to fully develop , but by the time it is diagnosed , it is usually fatal within two to five years			2
@entity6 was first classified as a disease in 1869 , yet there are still few clues as to its cause			1
researchers are just as far from finding an effective treatment or cure			0
in fact , just one drug has been approved by the @entity55 to treat @entity6 , and has been proved only to extend life by a few months			1
" they have no idea what is happening to us			0
i 'm taking it one day at a time , " @entity3 says			1
@entity3 has found that many of his brothers suffer from the illness as well -- his fellow veterans , that is			1
" there have been recent studies that have been proven that if you are a veteran , your chances of developing als are double that of anyone else , " @entity3 says			1
dr. @entity72 , an assistant professor at the @entity73 , said that doctors took notice as a large number of veterans of the first @entity78 began to report " non-specific neurological conditions			0
" several subsequent studies published in the last decade have established an increased rate of @entity6 among @entity78 veterans			1
@entity72 was co-author of a study in 2005 that found that men with any history of military service are about 60 percent more likely to develop als than men who did not serve in the military			2
he concluded that " the branch , length of service , and where you served did n't seem to matter			2
" the cause of this connection is still unknown			0
@entity72 says that there may be an environmental trigger , but due to the immensity of potential exposures to which military personnel are subjected , no one has been able to pinpoint exactly what that trigger might be			0
for men who are trained to fight for their lives , this disease is perhaps the ultimate torture			2
" the way we are in the military , if you show us an enemy , we 'll defeat it , " @entity3 says			2
" it 's really hard to identify what you 're fighting			0
i 'm just fighting to stay alive			0
" the @entity116 established als as a service - connected disease on september 23 , 2008			1
this acknowledgment gives veterans suffering from @entity6 access to much - needed benefits such as health care , disability compensation , and many other essential support systems			1
while it may seem as if the @entity116 has moved slowly in reacting to these studies , @entity72 notes that there is still a lot that is unknown about the connection between als and military service			1
" in that regard , i commend the @entity116 in taking this step before many scientists are fully convinced , " @entity72 says			2
nonetheless , for those suffering from @entity6 , navigating the vast bureaucracy at the @entity116 can be an exasperating process			1
veterans such as @entity3 find themselves in the helpless position of watching their disease advance at a much faster pace than their paperwork			1
when he filed for disability last march , @entity3 was told that his request could take up to a year to be approved -- if it is approved			2
despite his deteriorating condition , @entity3 has chosen to remain positive			2
each day , he carefully gets out of bed and tests his legs , hopeful that he is able to walk for one more day			0
he is all too aware that he will wake up one day soon and his limbs will no longer work			0
someday , he will lose the ability to talk , and eventually , he will stop breathing			0
but today , he can do all of these things , and he is grateful			0
" what i do all day long , is i tell myself in six months , i will probably be in much worse condition , and in six months i would give anything to be where i am today , " he says			0
" so today i 'm happy with what i have			0

@entity6 , a progressive disease , attacks brain neurons leading to total paralysis
