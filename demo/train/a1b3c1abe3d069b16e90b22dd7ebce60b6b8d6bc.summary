@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 on monday reinstated a @entity6 man 's murder conviction that had been overturned because the victim 's dying words were used in the trial			1
the justices concluded the mortally wounded man 's statements to police were " non-testimonial " and therefore admissible in court			1
the 6 - 2 decision found police were confronted with an unresolved situation at the crime scene involving an at - large suspect			1
that gave officers latitude to question @entity22 , the bleeding victim , for information			1
" there was an ongoing emergency here where an armed shooter , whose motive for and location after the shooting were unknown , had mortally wounded @entity22 within a few blocks and a few minutes of the location where police found @entity22 , " justice @entity24 wrote for the majority			0
in april 2001 , police in @entity37 found @entity22 at a gas station with a gunshot wound to the abdomen , in great pain , and having a hard time speaking			0
when asked " what had happened , who had shot him , and where the shooting had occurred , " @entity22 replied that he was shot outside a nearby home , had driven himself to the gas station and identified the assailant as @entity50			0
after the five - to 10 - minute conversation , the victim was taken to a hospital , where he soon died			1
police used the statements to go to @entity50 's home , where they found the victim 's blood and identification , along with a spent bullet and a bullet hole			1
@entity50 was arrested and later convicted of second - degree murder and felony possession of a firearm			1
he appealed , saying the dead man 's statements violated the @entity69 's confrontation clause , which gives defendants the right to cross-examine " testimonial " evidence against them , including eyewitness statements			2
at issue was whether @entity22 's remarks represented such testimony or were " excited utterances " that helped police assess a crime emergency			2
@entity24 said police 's initial inquiries about what happened " were the exact type of questions necessary to allow police to assess the situation , the threat to their own safety , and possible danger to the potential victim			1
" she added that since " the situation was fluid " with different officers arriving at different times and each asking what happened , police " did not conduct a structured interrogation , " which would normally be barred from trial without the presence of the person who had been questioned			2
the high court in 2006 gave greater protection to defendants over the use of hearsay testimony in criminal cases			2
the justices said cross-examination is required to admit prior testimonial statements of witnesses when those statements have since become unavailable			0
that case involved a spouse who refused to testify in court about a stabbing after earlier telling police what had happened			2
the @entity50 case involved the so - called " dying declaration " exception , and whether that should be applied in this case			1
justice @entity120 noted in her dissent that the question was never raised in the original appeal , so could not be resolved by the court			0
in a separate , tartly worded dissent by justice @entity126 , he blasted the majority for " judicial mischief			0
" " today 's tale -- a story of five officers conducting successive examinations of a dying man with the primary purpose , not of obtaining and preserving his testimony regarding his killer , but of protecting him , them , and others from a murderer somewhere on the loose -- is so transparently false that professing to believe it demeans this institution , " he wrote			1
" in its vain attempt to make the incredible plausible , however -- or perhaps as an intended second goal -- today 's opinion distorts our @entity146 jurisprudence and leaves it in a shambles			0
instead of clarifying the law , the court makes itself the obfuscator of last resort			0
" he warned the court was offering a " hollow constitutional guarantee , " and concluded : " for all i know , @entity50 has received his just deserts			0
but he surely has not received them pursuant to the procedures that our @entity69 requires			0
and what has been taken away from him has been taken away from us all			0

the court 's ruling centers on the use of the slain victim 's words in the trial
@entity6 murder conviction had been overturned because the dying words were used
in 6 - 2 ruling , @entity2 says that the words were admissible
