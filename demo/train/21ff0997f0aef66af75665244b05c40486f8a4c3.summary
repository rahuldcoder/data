president @entity0 unveiled an aggressive new climate change strategy on tuesday that would limit pollution from existing coal - fired power plants , and he made clear that approval of the @entity5 depended on the project not increasing overall greenhouse gas emissions			1
@entity0 raised the two politically charged issues during a sweeping address on second - term environmental priorities that included his plan of executive actions that do n't require congressional approval in an era of partisan gridlock in @entity16			1
he also pledged global leadership on climate change and to redouble @entity20 efforts to fight it			1
the @entity23 speech came as environmental constituents and climate change advocates press him to take more aggressive action and to push harder for clean energy alternatives			1
@entity0 said he was taking action for the " sake of our children and the health and safety of all @entity20 , " saying new initiatives on his environmental agenda built around clean - energy industry and policy will spur the economy and leave a cleaner planet for future generations			1
" we can do all of that as long as we do n't fear the future and instead we seize it , " @entity0 said , adding that his plan was a signal to the world that @entity20 would take bold action to reduce carbon pollution			1
@entity0 pledged in 2009 the @entity20 would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17 % of 2005 levels by 2020			2
environmentalists have said decisive action was necessary to make that goal possible with a major legislative effort in @entity55 failing in @entity0 's first term			2
the president again said that @entity20 energy strategy must be more than producing more petroleum , reviving his call for eliminating tax breaks for " big oil			0
" " we ca n't drill our way out of the energy and climate challenges that we face , " he said , a familiar @entity64 sentiment on energy policy			0
@entity0 cautioned that the impact of his plan would be felt over time , but now is the moment to further prepare the nation to reduce carbon pollution and protect @entity20 from climate change			1
" the world still looks for the @entity20 to lead , " he said , noting that the @entity20 is the world 's largest economy and the second - largest carbon emitter			2
" we have a vital role to play , " he said			0
@entity0 said the @entity20 must use less " dirty energy , " waste less , and transition to cleaner sources , and redouble efforts to reach a new global agreement to reduce carbon emissions with " concrete action " that is ambitious , inclusive and flexible			2
he said the @entity20 must " strengthen our position " as a natural gas producer , which he said is producing jobs , lowering power bills , and over time would help the country transition to cleaner energy overall , including wind and solar power applications			0
and @entity0 said he does n't have much patience for those who say there 's no proof of man - made climate change			1
" we do n't have time for a meeting of the @entity104 , " he said			0
@entity20 having their say on divisive @entity5 plan @entity108 pipeline on the sensitive prospect of the @entity111 - to - @entity108 pipeline , @entity0 said it would only come about if its development would be in the nation 's best interest			1
and that , he said , would be served if the project does not significantly worsen carbon pollution			1
" the net effect on our climate will be absolutely critical in determining whether this project will be allowed to go forward , " he said			0
the @entity123 is in the final stages of reviewing the proposal that has contributed to the political stalemate in @entity16			1
proponents of the pipeline , many of them @entity129 that @entity0 is looking to compromise with on key issues , say @entity108 will enable @entity20 energy independence , create jobs and develop important industrial infrastructure			1
opinion : the real , and dirty , @entity0 scandal among detractors are some of @entity0 's traditional allies , who were instrumental in getting him elected twice			2
they say the massive pipeline effort is dangerous , inherently filthy and must be stopped			0
in a lengthy study , the @entity123 has weighed in on the side of proponents			0
but the @entity145 has blasted environmental impact assessments			2
the @entity111 crude that would flow through the @entity108 pipeline is mixed with sand in its raw form			2
environmental experts say extracting oil and transporting it requires more energy than pumping crude out of a well			0
pushing it through pipes increases the energy consumption as well			0
that higher energy use leads to greater greenhouse gas emissions , an increase of " 18.7 million metric tons ( 20 million tons ) c02 ... per year when compared to an equal amount of @entity20 average crudes , " the @entity145 said			0
coal plants the @entity0 administration created regulations for newly built coal plants during the president 's first term			1
on tuesday , he issued directives requiring the @entity145 to establish carbon pollution standards for plants that are already active			1
the administration is not laying out new standards on its own			0
instead , it plans to work with industry , states , labor and other interest groups to develop them			0
@entity0 directed the @entity145 to come up with a detailed draft proposal by june 2014 and a finalized version one year later			1
environmental groups have been calling on @entity0 to issue such regulations on coal plants , the largest source of carbon emissions in the @entity20			1
@entity0 argued that the benefits of reduced carbon emissions will far outweigh the costs of implementing new rules			2
critics have said new regulations could damage the economy			0
construction of new coal plants has slowed in part due to @entity145 regulations			2
" the impact could be economic havoc , " @entity199 , a spokesman for the @entity200 , which represents the coal industry , told @entity202 earlier this year			0
coal is used to produce about 40 % of the nation 's electricity			0
@entity208 , president and chief executive of the @entity200 , told @entity55 last week that @entity20 exports of coal are becoming an increasingly large share of the economy			0
last year , he said , exports added $ 16.6 billion to the economy and supported 168,430 jobs			0
while the administration has not given a cost - benefit analysis of its new plan , the @entity216 ( @entity216 ) , a large environmental action group , estimates it would cost $ 4 billion to comply with new regulations on coal power plants , but the economy would see anywhere from $ 25 to $ 60 billion in benefits			2
a large part of the benefit comes from reduced health care costs			0
carbon pollution is known for contributing to higher rates of asthma , as well as other possible illnesses			1
@entity129 reaction was swift with the @entity129 's political arm in @entity232 rolling out its claim of @entity0 's " war on coal			0
" as part of the gubernatorial campaign , it quickly released a " robo call " initiative in the southwestern part of the state describing @entity64 support for " job - killing policies			0
" @entity0 's second term could look like his first frustration with @entity0 many environmentalists will likely embrace the president 's proposals on climate change even though he pushed through sharp cuts in car and truck emissions during his first term			1
activists have expressed frustration with the administration in the past , saying @entity0 has n't worked with a strong sense of urgency on the issue since taking office even though he pushed forward a sweeping plan to reduce car emissions and fuel use			0
while the idea of long - term climate change is a controversial notion politically , it 's accepted as fact by most researchers and @entity0			1
a march poll from @entity272 indicated nearly half -- 47 % -- of @entity20 think the @entity20 government is doing too little to protect the environment , while 35 % said the government was doing the right amount and 16 % said it was doing too much			1
the president offered renewed hope to the environmental community -- but fears among the coal mining industry and concerns among climate change skeptics -- in his inauguration speech and @entity286 address this year			1
he robustly signaled he would do more to combat climate change during his second term			1
and again last week , during a speech at the @entity290 in @entity291 , @entity0 urged countries to work together to fight the " global threat of our time			0
" opinion : climate change is real opinion : when crocodiles roamed the poles			2
