-- it 's been a year of up and down form for @entity3 , but could major championship winning consistency finally be on the horizon ? the @entity7 stretched his overnight lead at the @entity9 at @entity10 friday with a majestic second round of 66 -- matching his score thursday -- to finish the day on 12 - under - par. despite starting with a bogey at the first , @entity3 recovered to sink seven birdies and comfortably leads the way from @entity17 's @entity16 who lies four shots back in second place at 8 - under - par. a chasing group featuring @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 are all tied for third at 6 - under - par. it was almost a disastrous day for @entity28 , however , as the three - time @entity9 champion carded a round of 77 to end the day at 2 - over - par and only just make the cut			1
after an opening round of 69 , @entity28 was only three shots off the pace going into friday but dropped like a stone on an often windy but sun - kissed afternoon on @entity38 's northwest coast			1
in truth , @entity28 exhibited the kind of frustrating yo - yo form between first and second rounds that has inhibited @entity3 over the past months			1
just last week , @entity3 backed up an opening round of 64 with a 78 to slip off the way off the pace at the @entity45			1
there were to be no such worries friday , however			2
there was even a moment of light relief when a pheasant wandered across the eighth as @entity3 prepared to putt			1
" i just wanted to stick to my gameplan , " @entity3 told @entity53 upon reaching the clubhouse			1
" i had a shaky start with a bogey at the start but settled in and just played really well			2
" looking towards saturday and the stormy weather that is forecast for the early morning , @entity3 added that he hopes his major championship experience will stand him in good stead			1
" depending on what weather we get , i 'm looking forward to it			2
i 've been in this position before and enjoyed it and i 'll try to enjoy it again , " he said			0
@entity3 will have to watch out for the red - hot @entity16 whose impressive 65 , which included seven birdies , was the lowest score of the day			1
the 30 - year - old @entity71 has yet to win a major but revealed he was relishing the challenge at @entity10			0
" i 'm glad i 'm in the last group and playing with @entity3 , " @entity16 said			1
" but i 've got to go out and play my game			0
i ca n't worry about what he is doing			0
i 'll just go out there and try to shoot a good number			0
" further back , @entity22 will also fancy his chances if he can replicate the shot - making he displayed on the back nine after a tough start while @entity25 is still in with a shot of claiming his illusive first major			0
" i played some really good golf on the back nine and i 'm happy with what i did , " @entity22 said			0
" i usually keep an eye on the leaderboard but it 's still tough conditions out there			2
you need to be 100 % focused on what you 're doing			0
" despite a brutal of round that saw him record two double bogeys , @entity28 struck a similarly optimistic tone in conversation with reporters			1
he even highlighted the dramatic victory of @entity98 at the @entity99 at @entity100 as his inspiration for the weekend			2
" i had some opportunities but i never made anything			0
i had myself in good position to make birdies but i never did			0
" hopefully i can do something like @entity98 did in 1999 , make up 10 in one day			0
" elsewhere on the course , there was no luck for big hitters @entity110 , @entity112 and @entity113 who all missed the cut .			2

@entity3 extends lead at @entity9 after second round of 66
