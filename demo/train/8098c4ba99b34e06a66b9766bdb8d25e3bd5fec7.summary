-- the head of the @entity2 has expressed concern over a @entity6 judge 's refusal for a second time to annul a marriage between an 8 - year - old girl and a 47 - year - old man			1
@entity2 's @entity11 said consent can not be free if either party is too young to make an informed decision			1
" irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework , the marriage of a child is a violation of that child 's rights , " said @entity11 , executive director of @entity2			1
" the right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the @entity26			2
consent can not be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision			2
" the most recent ruling , in which the judge upheld his original verdict , was handed down saturday in the @entity6 city of @entity34 , where late last year the same judge rejected a petition from the girl 's mother , seeking a divorce for her daughter			1
have your say by clicking here a relative said the judge , @entity51 , " stuck by his earlier verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once she reached puberty			1
" the family member , who requested anonymity , added that the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter			1
the case , which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups , came to light in december when @entity51 declined to annul the marriage on a legal technicality			1
the judge ruled that the girl 's mother -- who is separated from her father -- was not the girl 's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court , @entity62 , the mother 's attorney , told @entity0 at the time			1
the girl 's father , according to the lawyer , arranged the marriage in order to settle his debts with the man , who is a close friend of his			1
at the time of the initial verdict , the judge required the girl 's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty , @entity62 told @entity0			1
the judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty , she will have the right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court , the lawyer said			1
last month , an appeals court in the @entity6 capital of @entity96 declined to certify the original ruling , in essence rejecting @entity51 's verdict , and sent the case back to him for reconsideration			2
under the complicated @entity6 legal process , the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect , but that a challenge to the marriage was still ongoing			2
the appeals court in @entity96 will now take up the case again and a hearing is scheduled for next month , according to the relative			0
the issue of child marriage has been a hot - button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom recently			1
while rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages , the kingdom 's top cleric has said that it 's ok for girls as young as 10 to wed. " it is incorrect to say that it 's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger , " @entity126 , the kingdom 's grand mufti , said in remarks last january , according to the regional @entity130 newspaper			2
" a girl aged 10 or 12 can be married			0
those who think she 's too young are wrong , and they are being unfair to her			0
" @entity126 reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry			0
" we hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls , " he said , according to the newspaper			0
" we should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women			0

@entity6 follows a strict interpretation of @entity154 called @entity156			0
@entity0 was unable to reach government officials for comment			2
@entity159 , a @entity6 researcher for @entity160 , told @entity0 in december that his organization has heard of many other cases of child marriages			1
" we 've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the @entity6 public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men , " @entity159 said			0
@entity159 said that although @entity6 ministries might make decisions designed to protect children , " it is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts , and in many realms beyond the court			0
" in december , @entity181 , a spokesman for the @entity6 government - run @entity182 , said his organization is fighting against child marriages			2
" the @entity182 opposes child marriages in @entity6 , " @entity181 said			0
" child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by @entity6 and should not be allowed			0
" he added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place			2
@entity189 , co-founder of the @entity190 , told @entity0 that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to " keep us backward and in the dark ages			1
" she said the marriages cause girls to " lose their sense of security and safety			0

it causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression			0
