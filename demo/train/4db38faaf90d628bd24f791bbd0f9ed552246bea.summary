-- @entity1 capped off a memorable week by booking its place in the @entity4 final for the second time in three seasons			1
@entity1 , which defeated fierce rival @entity6 at @entity7 last monday , claimed a 2 - 1 win over @entity9 at @entity10 sunday to set up a final tie with @entity12			1
@entity1 last won the country 's oldest and most prestigious cup competition back in 2011 when it defeated @entity15 1 - 0			1
on this occasion , @entity17 's first half strike and @entity19 's looping header secured victory for @entity23 's men in a thrilling contest against last season 's @entity26 winners			1
@entity29 's spectacular 66th minute strike had given @entity9 a sniff of a comeback and manager @entity32 was left seething after claiming his side was denied a clear penalty			1
the @entity35 looked set to equalize when @entity36 raced through only to appear to be wrestled to the ground by @entity1 captain @entity38 -- but the officials decided against awarding a spot kick			1
" was it a penalty ? yes clearly			2
very clearly , " @entity32 told @entity43			2
" the penalty not being given was a key moment in the game as @entity38 could also have been sent off			2
" you can see the pictures			0
we have two situations like that in the second half			0
" we played against a very good team , if they had scored another the game would have been over			0
" but we keep going and we had chances to be back in the game so these decisions were very important			0
" @entity9 , which defeated @entity58 in last year 's final , was second best for much of the contest and trailed at the break through @entity17 's close range finish			1
@entity19 's effort two minutes after interval increased @entity1 's lead before @entity29 's acrobatic effort ensured a frantic finale			1
" it was a difficult game , " @entity23 told @entity43			0
" the players did well to win this game , fighting for every ball until the last second			2
" in the first half we had everything under control			0
when @entity29 scored , it caused us a problem for 10 minutes			2
" when we won the @entity4 against @entity15 , it was a difficult game , and i expect the same against @entity12			1
" but now we have to win the final and finish second in the championship that is our target			1
" @entity9 's hope of winning a trophy now rests on the @entity84 where it faces a semifinal against @entity88 side @entity87			1
" i am really disappointed with the result			0
when we played with @entity36 , the team had more energy , " @entity32 told reporters			0
" if you see the performance in the second - half , the players will know they can do well in the rest of the season			2
you could see we had energy , quality and desire			0
" while @entity1 was celebrating at @entity10 , its arch rival @entity6 was also reflecting on success after claiming a 2 - 0 win at @entity15 -- a win which takes it 15 points clear at the summit of the @entity110			1
@entity112 's first goal in 10 games and @entity115 's opener allowed @entity6 to pick up all three points at struggling @entity15			1
and manager @entity117 was delighted to see his star striker finally get back amongst the goals -- even if he was almost sent flying by the subsequent celebration			0
" he nearly killed me ! he forgets i 'm 71 , " @entity117 joked			0
" it was a great celebration as it brought the emotion of the players and the fans together			0
we really did celebrate that			0
" @entity6 now requires just seven points from its final six games to win the title and wrestle it back from neighbor @entity1			1
@entity117 told @entity133 : " " if we were starting the season today , with seven games left , would we fancy ourselves to win the league ? that was the point of it			1
" not looking back or looking at the points we got or the goal difference			2
it 's to start the season today			0
" the players deserve all the credit for the battling performance they gave			0
" the character of the team is showing			0
they went out on the pitch with that and got the result they deserved			0
" in the day 's other @entity110 game , @entity153 produced a memorable performance to claim a 3 - 0 win at fierce foe @entity157			1
manager @entity158 led the celebrations as goals from @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 propelled @entity153 three points clear of the drop zone			1
and the 44 - year - old @entity166 took time to dedicate the victory to his late mother , who passed away exactly one year ago yesterday			2
@entity158 asked reporters : " can i tell you something ? " sometimes , some special things have to remain inside yourself			0
it 's not good to share with others because it 's very deep inside yourself			0
" but i believe in this thing			0
before the kick off , i saw the face of my @entity178 smiling			2
exactly yesterday , it was one year since she passed away			0
" exactly one year ago , there was the same situation			0
i was in the dug - out the day after she passed away and we won the game -- i was at @entity186 -- and today , it has happened again			2
" for this , i have to thank not only my @entity178 , otherwise my @entity190 - he is next to her , but today , he is going to be upset			2
" but @entity190 , @entity178 was special today , so my dedication goes to her today , to my mam			0

meanwhile , @entity210 scored twice as third place @entity211 cruised to a 5 - 0 win over @entity214 , while @entity216 's @entity215 kept his side 's push for @entity26 football on track			1

in @entity227 , third - place @entity226 drew 1 - 1 with second place @entity229 in a result which does neither team any good in their pursuit of league leader @entity233			1
@entity235 gave @entity226 a 30th minute lead only for @entity237 to equalize three minutes later			0
