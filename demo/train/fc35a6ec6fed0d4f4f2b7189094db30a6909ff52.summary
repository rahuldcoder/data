@entity0 -- @entity3 's police swung into action thursday as two separate incidents , one involving a security scare on a bus and the other six terror arrests , pointed to the heightened state of alert ahead of the @entity10			1
security is a central concern for @entity3 authorities and the organizers of the @entity15 , which start in three weeks			1
after launching a major response to the security alert on the bus , which led armed officers to close a major motorway , police in @entity22 concluded the incident was not terror - related			1
but its officers responded " swiftly and proportionately " to credible information from a concerned member of the public , a @entity22 police statement said			0
" we can now confirm that , whilst this was a genuine security alert , the significant concerns reported to us were unfounded , " the statement said			0
" the information received concerned a report of vapor escaping from a bag which on investigation turned out to be a health improvement aid for smokers			2
" hours earlier , police in @entity0 arrested five men and a woman on terror charges , although they said the operation was not related to the @entity15			1
the six , aged from 18 to 30 , were all arrested on suspicion of the commission , preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism and are being questioned , @entity0 's @entity46 said			1
officers searched homes in east , west and north @entity0 as well as business premises in east @entity0			2
one of the men arrested had worked from 2007 to 2009 as a police community support officer for the @entity46 , the force said in a statement , and " was not deployed in a specialist or sensitive role			1
" police community support officers are members of staff who work alongside the regular police force , mostly to tackle local anti-social behavior and low level issues			0
the operation in @entity0 is not linked to the @entity15 and @entity69 , the police said			1
@entity3 security officials on alert for @entity15 terror threats additional security measures will be in place in @entity0 and elsewhere during the @entity15			1
they include the siting of missile defense systems around the capital and fighter jets on standby at air bases close to @entity0			0
police and intelligence agencies have also stepped up monitoring efforts			0
thursday 's dramatic closure of the busy @entity86 motorway , near @entity87 , had many hallmarks of a response to a potential terror threat and could be seen as a sign that police are taking no chances			2
armed police , firefighters and military bomb disposal units raced to the scene as passengers were evacuated from the bus , which had pulled over near the town of @entity101			0
police in @entity3 are not usually armed when they respond to incidents			2
officials insist no specific terror threats tied to @entity15 passengers were lined up on the tarmac for questioning , and their luggage and the vehicle searched , before police confirmed that there was no terror threat and that no one was considered a suspect			0
" our utmost priority was the safety and security of those people on the coach and those traveling on the motorway , " the force said			0
the 48 passengers who were on the bus from the northwestern city of @entity126 to @entity0 are now being taken on to their planned destination , a spokeswoman for @entity129 said			2
" we would like to thank our customers for their patience and understanding during today 's police operation , which followed concerns raised by a passenger during the journey , " a statement from the bus operator said			1
" the safety and welfare of our passengers and our staff is our absolute priority			0
" the bus has been moved and the highway has reopened , police said			0
government officials from @entity148 to @entity0 insist there are no known specific or credible terror threats tied to the @entity15			2
nonetheless , authorities on both sides of the @entity153 are urging vigilance			0
the @entity46 is leading the " largest peacetime operation " seen in the @entity3 as it seeks to keep the public safe , it said , with up to 9,500 police officers from @entity0 and elsewhere to be deployed on the busiest days of the @entity15			1
as a result , @entity0 's residents and its visitors can expect to see a large police presence on the streets and airport - style security at @entity15 venues			1
@entity1 's @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
