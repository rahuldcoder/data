@entity0 -- president @entity2 warned tuesday of " difficult days ahead " for @entity3 and said the transition following president @entity6 's earlier announcement that he wo n't run for re-election in september must begin immediately			1
in a brief statement to reporters at the @entity10 , @entity2 pledged continuing @entity12 support for both a longtime ally and the aspirations of protesting @entity3 , whose eight days of growing demonstrations led to @entity6 's dramatic announcement on state television			1
" we 've borne witness to the beginning of a new chapter in the history of a great country and a long - time partner of the @entity12 , " @entity2 said of the @entity6 statement less than three hours earlier			1
noting that he and @entity6 had just spoken by phone , @entity2 said @entity6 " recognizes that the status quo is not sustainable and a change must take place			2
" repeating earlier calls for an orderly transition in @entity3 from @entity6 's nearly three decades of repressive rule to a fully representative democracy , @entity2 said the transition " must be meaningful , it must be peaceful and it must begin now			1
" " furthermore , the process must include a broad spectrum of @entity3 voices and opposition parties , " @entity2 said			2
" it should lead to elections that are free and fair			0
and it should result in a government that 's not only grounded in democratic principles but is also responsive to the aspirations of the @entity3 people			2
" earlier , sources told @entity1 that a @entity12 envoy sent by @entity2 urged @entity6 to announce he wo n't run for re-election later this year , a major shift in foreign policy regarding the main @entity54 ally of the @entity12 and a vital partner in the @entity57 peace process because of its 1978 treaty with @entity59			1
according to the sources , who spoke on condition of not being identified by name , former @entity12 ambassador to @entity3 @entity60 conveyed the message to @entity6 in @entity3			1
it was unclear if the meeting was monday or tuesday			0
until now , the street demonstrations in @entity3 demanding @entity6 's ouster had drawn a measured @entity12 response that advocated step - by - step reforms for pro-democracy changes while maintaining stability			1
this week , though , calls increased for the @entity2 administration to push for @entity6 to step aside immediately or announce he would not be a candidate in the next presidential election scheduled for september			2
one of @entity3 's leading opposition figures , @entity78 , warned monday that the @entity12 needed to " let go " of its longtime ally			1
" you should n't be behind the curve , and you need to start building confidence with the people and not with the people who are smothering the people , " @entity78 , the former head of the @entity80 , told @entity1 's " @entity87 360			0
" the unrest in @entity3 presented @entity2 with a complex issue that lacked easy answers			2
@entity3 -- the main @entity54 ally of the @entity12 -- is inexorably linked to neighboring @entity59 -- the main @entity12 ally in the @entity57 -- by a peace treaty that guarantees more than $ 1 billion a year in @entity12 military aid to @entity6 's government			1
@entity3 also provides vital logistical and intelligence assistance to the @entity12 , which has urged @entity6 for years to implement democratic reforms but always put the strategic benefits first			1
@entity98 , the @entity12 ambassador to @entity3 from 1997 to 2001 , said the administration wants to both support " an exceedingly strong ally " and promote democratic reform and more openness in " a closed authoritarian society			0
" " the @entity12 is trying to find comfortable ground in which we can argue for both without abandoning an ally and without abandoning our principles , " @entity98 told @entity1 on monday			0
@entity3 's turmoil follows years of social , political and economic grievances that fueled the street protests that began last week and have since escalated			1
after ruling with an iron fist for three decades , @entity6 had given no indication of giving up power before his statement tuesday night			2
however , @entity78 and other opposition figures immediately condemned @entity6 's announcement as insufficient , saying the president needed to step aside immediately for a caretaker government of national unity to lead @entity3 until new presidential and parliamentary elections can be held			1
@entity2 's statement avoided addressing the opposition demands , instead promising the demonstrators -- particularly young @entity3 looking to the @entity12 for support and leadership -- that @entity12 supported their aspirations			1
" we hear your voices , " @entity2 said			0
" i have an unyielding belief that you will determine your own destiny and seize the promise of a better future for your children and your grandchildren			0
and i say that as someone who is committed to a partnership between the @entity12 and @entity3			0
" there will be difficult days ahead , " @entity2 continued			1
" many questions about @entity3 's future remain unanswered , but i am confident that the people of @entity3 will find those answers			1
" in the past week , demonstrators in @entity3 have questioned why @entity2 , who championed human rights and democracy in a 2009 speech in @entity148 , was n't condemning @entity6 and applying pressure to help bring the changes they seek			1
@entity78 , who returned to his native @entity3 last week as an opposition figure last week , said @entity3 need to see that the @entity12 is supporting their aspirations			0
" people need to see that you not only talk the talk , but walk the walk , and people need to understand and believe that you really , seriously take democracy , rule of law , freedoms seriously , " @entity78 said sunday			0
asking " a dictator " to implement democratic reforms " is an oxymoron , frankly			0
" on monday , @entity10 press secretary @entity165 said @entity3 's government should engage in " meaningful negotiations with a broad section of civil society , including opposition groups , " and hold " free and fair elections " in september			1
the transition called for by the @entity12 " means change , and what we 've advocated from the very beginning is that the way @entity3 looks and operates must change , " @entity165 told reporters			0
at the same time , he said it is not the place of the @entity12 to support or oppose the possible ouster of @entity6			0
one of the @entity184 's most influential foreign policy voices , democrat @entity185 of @entity186 , called tuesday for @entity6 to step down , reflecting the rapidly changing consensus among top @entity0 policymakers			2
@entity185 , the chairman of the @entity189 and the 2004 @entity191 presidential nominee , also said @entity6 's son , @entity192 , should not take the reins of power in @entity148			0
the @entity12 government needs to start paying closer attention to the " genuine political , legal and economic needs " of people in the @entity57 , as opposed to consistently supporting friendly governments regardless of their domestic politics , @entity185 said in an op - ed commentary published by the @entity202			0
" for three decades , the @entity12 pursued a @entity6 policy , " he wrote			0
" now we must look beyond the @entity6 era and devise an @entity3 policy			2
" to @entity208 , director of the @entity57 program at the @entity211 , the unrest in @entity3 showed that the @entity12 policy of backing @entity6 despite his poor record on political and human rights has failed to bring desired stability			2
instead of what she labeled " subtle " language such as endorsing an orderly transition , the @entity12 should call for a government of national unity to take over until fully democratic elections for both the presidency and the parliament , @entity216 told @entity1 on monday			0
