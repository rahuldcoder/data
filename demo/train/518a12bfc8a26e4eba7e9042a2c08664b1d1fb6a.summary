-- @entity2 fans -- including co-founder @entity3 -- lined up on friday morning for a chance to buy the @entity5 , the latest in the company 's line of " @entity8 , " which includes many under - the - hood improvements			1
the lines , which drew thousands , were part exercises in tech commercialism and part homages to @entity15 , @entity2 's other co-founder , who died last week following a battle with pancreatic cancer			1
in @entity19 , @entity2 fans created a makeshift memorial to @entity15 that included flowers , photos , ipad boxes and apples ( as in the fruit )			1
and in @entity27 , some people said they were lining up for the phone in part because of @entity15			2
" i wanted it anyway , but ( @entity15 ' death ) made me sort of want it more because this is the last one i know he worked on , " @entity31 , from an @entity27 suburb , said of his decision to buy the phone			1
" i just hope the company keeps going in the same direction			0
" about 200 people had lined up in the wee hours of the morning in @entity19 to buy the new phone , which has a faster processor and a " digital assistant " that responds to voice commands and talks back to phone owners , answering their questions			1
long lines also formed in @entity47 and @entity48 as people waited for the phone			0
in @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity3 , the @entity2 co-founder who , along with @entity15 , helped create the world 's first truly personal computer , sat in an armchair at the front of a line that began forming thursday afternoon			1
he tapped on his @entity60 , sipped @entity61 and took photos with fans while he awaited the phone 's release			2
" i want to get mine along with the millions of other fans , " @entity3 said			0
" i just want to be able to talk to my phone			0
" the @entity5 initially was panned by critics , who said it was more of a facelift to the @entity72 than a new product			1
the phone 's exterior looks the same as its predecessor , but the guts are new			2
inside there 's a faster @entity81 dual - core processor , an improved 8 megapixel camera and a voice assistant named @entity84 , who will respond to voice commands and answer questions			1
when @entity89 , a tech writer at @entity90 , tested the phone , he found @entity84 to be quite the helpful -- and hilarious -- assistant			1
he published a series of his conversations with @entity84			2
" me : ' i 'm drunk , ' " he wrote			0
" siri : ' i found a number of cabs fairly close to you			0
' ( @entity97 ; it did n't dial my ex-girlfriend			0
) " aside from @entity15 , @entity84 seemed to be one of the main draws for people waiting in line for the @entity5			1
" i just want the personal assistant , " said @entity103 , 41 , an @entity27 nurse who had been waiting in line for the phone since 4:45 a.m. @entity107 , who also waited in an @entity27 line for the phone , teased a friend of his who said he was buying the @entity5 because of the camera			1
clearly , he said , " @entity84 is a big deal , " not the camera			2
" he 's got a secretary -- i do n't , " he joked			0
@entity115 , a 33 - year - old real - estate agent , also praised @entity2 's new digital assistant , which is only available on the @entity5 , and which has been compared to @entity117 , @entity118 and other fictional computer overlords			1
" i love @entity84 , " she said			0
" we played with it in the store			0
i know for sure it will make me a safer driver			0
i do n't have to scramble through my phone while i 'm driving			0
if i can talk to it and get answers , it 's going to cut out so much time for me			0
" plenty of excitement seemed to surround the phone 's release			2
in true @entity2 - head fashion , two @entity2 fans in @entity19 said they arrived at the flagship @entity137 18 days before friday , and blogged about the experience on a site called @entity140 , @entity134 reports			2
another person arrived at that store on crutches			0
" i got hit by a car and had surgery a few weeks ago			0
there 's tons of metal plates in my foot -- it shattered , " @entity145 , a 26 - year - old bartender , told @entity134			0
" is it worth it ? we 'll find out			0
" @entity2 ceo @entity153 helped unveil the @entity5 last week a day before @entity15 ' death			1
pre-orders of the phone started on october 7 and beat expectations			0
@entity2 sold 1 million of the phones in the first 24 hours via its website and carriers @entity161 , @entity162 and -- for the first time -- @entity164			1
by comparison , @entity2 reported 600,000 @entity72 pre-orders last year in 24 hours , but that included orders placed with overseas carriers			1
the @entity5 went on sale friday at all 245 @entity2 stores in the @entity172 , in addition to the following countries : @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 and the @entity180			1
the new @entity72 will be available in 22 additional countries by the end of october , @entity2 says			2
@entity2 stores and other retailers opened at 8 a.m. friday			1
online orders can be made at @entity2 's online store as well as on @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity164 's websites			1
if you were hoping to pre-order now and pick up the phone friday , you 're out of luck			0
pre-orders at @entity161 , @entity164 and @entity162 are sold out , and phones ordered through @entity2 's website may not be delivered for several weeks			1
all of those brick - and - mortar retail stores also will carry the phone , along with select @entity2 - approved retailers : @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201			2
( word of warning : check availability before lining up at one of those third - party sellers			0
@entity207 is limited , and some will be filling pre-orders before selling whatever stock may remain			0
) customers who buy the phone at an @entity2 retail store will be offered free in - store setup service , personalized instruction on how to set up e-mail and download apps			2
the phone sells for $ 199 for @entity218 of storage , $ 299 for @entity220 and $ 399 for @entity221 , marking the first time an @entity72 has had that much memory			2
it also seems impossible to separate interest in the @entity5 with news of @entity15 ' death last week			1
among the legions of @entity2 's diehard fans , some have taken saying the " @entity5 " in the phone 's name represents the words " for @entity3			1
" although it 's virtually impossible that the company would have done that on purpose ( the phone 's development happened largely when @entity15 was still ceo ) it speaks both to the long reach of @entity15 ' legacy and the cult - like devotion that some @entity2 loyalists feel toward the company and its products			1
@entity0 's @entity247 and @entity248 and @entity134 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's @entity5 goes on sale at 8 a.m. friday in each time zone
pre-orders have broken an @entity2 record , with 1 million in first 24 hours
phone features faster processor , better camera , " personal assistant " @entity84
friday is first @entity72 release since death of @entity2 co-founder @entity15
