prosecutors argued that his negligence included leaving @entity8 unmonitored and unattended while the powerful anesthetic was being pumped into his vein through an iv drip			2
deputy district attorney @entity60 , arguing for the maximum four years in jail , said @entity2 was " playing @entity63 roulette with @entity8 's life every single night , " by using propofol to put him to sleep in " a reckless , obscene manner			1
