-- @entity1 has sent a clear message to any developers who try to game its @entity5			1
software developer @entity7 has been kicked out , along with more than 1,000 of its @entity10 applications			1
the @entity16 developer had , according to some estimates , 1,000 - plus applications in the store , most of which were copycat knockoffs of existing applications			1
when a friend of writers at the @entity24 photography blog saw these rather poor applications consistently scoring 5 - star reviews , they got suspicious			0
some investigation showed that @entity7 's applications were getting many top ratings and almost nothing in the 2 - to - 4 - star range			2
in fact , the only other ratings were often 1 - star , and likely the only truthful feedback on the apps ' pages			0
@entity24 wrote a long letter to @entity1 's marketing boss , @entity39 , and posited that @entity7 was giving out promotional codes -- essentially free copies of the applications -- in return for these 5 - star reviews			1
in almost all cases , these reviews were poorly written , and came from customers who almost exclusively reviewed just @entity7 applications			1
this scam was so effective that the applications regularly rose to the tops of charts			0
one , called @entity53 , even made it into the @entity56 section of the store ( which brings some doubt as to whether these are actually staff picks at all )			0
after a week of typical @entity1 silence , @entity24 wrote again , and received a reply direct from @entity39 : " yes , this developer 's apps have been removed from the @entity5 and their ratings no longer appear either			1
" so what , you say ? some dodgy developer got its entire portfolio chucked down the memory hole , and the @entity5 continues as if @entity7 had never existed			1
first , the scale of this purging is huge : 1,000 applications represents almost 1 percent of the entire app store offering			0
this alone shows that @entity1 is happy to do whatever it takes to keep its house clean			1
it also shows the power that @entity1 has over those that sell in its exclusive marketplace			2
sure , @entity82 was caught cheating , and punished , but @entity1 could pull the same trick on any developer , for any reason			2
we do n't think that it would , @entity89 developers are a nervous bunch as it is , rubbing on rabbits ' feet and crossing their fingers as their creations make their way through a fickle and seemingly arbitrary approval process			0
and what about the customers ? we doubt that @entity7 will be refunding all the money it has made selling the applications ( plus 30 percent on top that went to @entity1 , and is non-returnable )			1
this means that , at best , these customers can keep using their now - banned apps until a future @entity106 update breaks them			2
perhaps , though , they should have bought better applications in the first place ? this is the key			0
because there is no clear way to try - before - you buy , the shareware model that works so well for computers , the ratings are absurdly important to choosing an application			0
@entity82 's scam , then , is almost a symptom of the @entity5 setup itself			0

@entity1 kicks software developer @entity7 and its 1,000 apps out of its @entity5
@entity16 developer was *accused* of trading free apps for good reviews
writer : move shows @entity1 's willingness to clean house to maintain *integrity* of its store
customers are likely able to keep @entity7 apps until next operating *system* update
