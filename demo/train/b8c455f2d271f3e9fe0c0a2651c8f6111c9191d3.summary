@entity0 -- sen. @entity4 repeatedly asked for invoices to cover home renovations and otherwise complied with @entity8 rules on accepting and reporting gifts of value , his defense attorney said in closing arguments tuesday			1
sen. @entity4 leaves the federal courthouse tuesday evening with his daughter @entity13			1
@entity4 , 84 , has been fighting a seven - count indictment accusing him of filing false statements on mandatory financial disclosure forms			1
the jury is scheduled to begin deliberating wednesday			0
in closing arguments , prosecutors said @entity4 engaged in an elaborate scheme to accept thousands of dollars in gifts from @entity23 oil industry executive @entity22 , who has admitted he tried to bribe state legislators , including the senator 's son			1
@entity4 is not accused of bribery , but one prosecutor suggested he accepted gifts , concealed them from the public , and " took care of @entity31 " -- referring to @entity22 , the founder of oil services contractor @entity32 the trial has revolved around a construction project at the @entity4 family chalet in @entity36 , @entity23 , about 40 miles from @entity37 at the foot of a ski resort			1
@entity22 , starting in 2000 , helped organize labor , materials and subcontractors that doubled the size of the home			0
in his closing arguments , defense attorney @entity46 said the government failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt , and that the jury should acquit @entity4 on all counts			1
he noted @entity22 had testified that @entity4 would have paid whatever bills were sent , but that he decided not to tell @entity4 the full cost " because i like @entity4			2
" @entity22 also testified an @entity23 neighbor overseeing the home renovation said @entity4 was " just trying to cover his ass " in requesting invoices for the project			2
prosecutors have said none of the evidence shows @entity4 ever paid @entity22 or @entity32 , and that neither is named on the disclosure forms			1
the neighbor , @entity66 , testified during the trial that he never made that remark			0
on tuesday , the defense highlighted the contradiction against the testimony of the prosecution 's star witness , making it a theme throughout a series of correspondence in which @entity4 continued to ask for a full accounting			1
" if you 're covering your ass , " @entity46 told the jury , " why , a month later , are you asking for the bill again ? " prosecutors played a recorded phone call between @entity66 and @entity22			1
" @entity4 gets hysterical when he has to spend his own money , " @entity84 told a mutual friend in the recording , which was played for jurors by @entity89 , the assistant @entity90 attorney for @entity23			2
@entity4 , who spends most of his time in @entity0 , gave @entity66 power of attorney so he could get the required building permit to work on the chalet @entity4 has owned since 1983			2
persons also confided to @entity22 that he did n't believe @entity4 had enough money to do the remodeling			0
later tuesday , the government made its final case			0
" wow ! " shouted prosecutor @entity101 as she stood to address the jury , " were we at the same trial ? because the evidence i saw was totally different			2
" she urged the jury to find the senator guilty on all counts , saying the evidence shows " @entity4 knowingly and repeatedly violated the law because he thought he was above the law			1
" the judge will remind the jury that @entity22 's testimony against @entity4 is part of a deal with prosecutors that could reduce his jail time when sentenced for attempted bribery			0
@entity120 , the lead prosecutor in the @entity4 case , tried to bolster @entity22 's standing as the jury prepared to deliberate			2
" the only thing he 's guilty of with regard to this defendant is standing up and telling the truth " about materials and labor he arranged on the home improvement project , @entity120 said of @entity22			0
" it was the defendant who is responsible for reporting it			0
" if convicted on all counts , @entity4 would face a maximum sentence of 35 years			0
legal experts note the judge has the discretion to give @entity4 as little as no jail time and probation			0
former federal prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers have told @entity1 that if convicted on some or all of the counts , the senator probably would face between a year to more than two years in jail .			0
