when @entity1 returned home the morning after the typhoon struck , he found part of the roof missing from his home			1
it was n't as bad as @entity8 , " he said , referring to @entity8 , which completely destroyed his house in the @entity12 " barangay , " or district , of @entity14 a year ago			1
" it was so scary			2
" much of his barangay , which lies close to the water 's edge , was decimated by the storm surge that was generated by the most powerful storm ever to make landfall in november , 2013			1
it is also one of the poorest areas in @entity14			1
little more than a year on and most people in this traumatized town in the central @entity28 will be incredibly relieved that @entity29 , which passed some 50 kilometers north , came with nothing like the force of @entity33			1
most of what has been rebuilt in the past few months has largely remained intact			2
@entity1 was one of many who heeded official warnings to evacuate to safer areas during the storm -- he was not going to repeat the mistake he made last year of trying to ride it out			1
surveying the damage around his modest home , its walls held up by various metal sheets and cardboard boxes , @entity1 seemed remarkably positive : " it 's not so bad			1
" pointing at the missing part of his ceiling above his living area and kitchen , he added : " it was not nailed down as well as the other area of roof			2
" he 'll just repair it again like last time			2
typhoon tracker : @entity59 's path checking for damage this was a typical scene across @entity14 on sunday morning , as some 48,000 people anxiously prepared to return to their homes from evacuation centers to check the damage			1
according to the mayor and the city 's disaster management authorities , there have so far been no casualties and power should be restored in the next day or so			2
@entity73 up is more about mopping up ; torrential rains drenched the entire area , flooding many roads			2
though the storm was nowhere near as powerful as last year 's , authorities took no chances and were prepared for what was to come			1
our next stop was the @entity84 church , a building that became symbolic of the damage done by @entity33			1
almost leveled completely , it was in the process of being renovated			0
@entity29 spared it this time around -- the only clues to what took place the night before were lots of tree branches and roots strewn around the surrounding streets			1
still waiting for homes many people in @entity14 are still living in tents or other rudimentary structures more than a year after @entity33			1
they 've been promised new homes but the process has been extremely slow			0
for those lucky enough to get one , they 're often located miles away			0
they may be away from vulnerable , flood - prone areas , but they 're also far from where they work , shops and their friends			0
these are the main reasons why many have chosen -- against the wishes of the government -- to rebuild their basic shanty homes in areas like @entity12 and @entity119			1
yet some like @entity120 , 58 , another resident of @entity12 , would jump at the chance of a new home if only she was offered one			1
she and her family are among hundreds who have spent the last few days camped out at the local @entity128 " redemption " church			0
" i do n't know how long i 'm going to be here , as the roof was blown off my house last night , " she said			0
her home -- a typical wooden and metal shack -- was wiped out last year			1
as a result , she spent more than 20 days at the redemption , lying between pews with her children			0
though it is easily the sturdiest building in the area , the church 's perforated roof is a reminder that @entity33 spared little in its path			0
@entity120 does n't know how she 'll carry out the repairs this time around			0
her house is located in an area declared a " no build zone " because it was so close to the coast and therefore vulnerable to storm surges			0
" we need help from the government -- financial assistance , materials , so we can rebuild , " she said			1
they got no help after @entity33 , she added			0
aside from delivering parcels of rice and noodles , she said no one from the government had been near over the past few days			0
asked if she 'd consider one of the new houses the local government pledged to build in the wake of @entity33 , she was emphatic : " we no longer have a home here			1
for my family we are willing to move , to transfer			0
" sheltering in chapel the atmosphere inside the main chapel at the redemption was far calmer than a day earlier when everyone nervously awaited the arrival of @entity29 -- these were among the town 's poorest and most vulnerable			1
a white board listed everyone who was evacuated here , including several heavily pregnant women			0
@entity182 , another local , is also a volunteer with a local ngo dealing with disaster risk reduction			0
her entire family is staying in an adjacent hall			0
" we 're more prepared this year , with more people prepared to leave their houses , " she said			1
" last year , we had 70 families staying with us in the church			2
this time we have more than 200			0
" yet she and her family still do n't have a house , more than a year after @entity33			2
and now the house she had been staying in has been badly damaged			0
" i do n't know where we 'll go this time , " she said			0
" we helped organize a home owner 's association and luckily , with help from the church , the @entity201 , and a few other groups , we 'll be eligible for free housing -- but it 's still in the process			2
hopefully two years from now i will have one			0
