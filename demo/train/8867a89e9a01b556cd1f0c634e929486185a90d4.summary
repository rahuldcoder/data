-- the new anti-smoking campaign launched by the @entity2 is a smart move			1
this is the largest nationwide advertising effort the @entity2 has ever launched to combat tobacco addiction			1
by spending $ 54 million and playing stark and graphic advertisements throughout the country , the government hopes to drive home the message that smoking is harmful and that there is help for those who want to quit			0
smoking and second - hand exposure to it is the leading cause of preventable death and chronic disease in the @entity20			0
smoking - related illnesses , like cancer , cardiovascular and respiratory diseases , account for a very large proportion of costs on our health care system and economy			0
anti-smoking symbol reveals ' worst moment ' various communities , state and federal agencies have tried to educate the public about the adverse health effect of smoking by implementing smoke - free environmental policies , raising taxes on tobacco products , pushing out mass media campaigns and adding school programs			2
however , the tobacco industry easily outspends them and the combined campaign efforts of the @entity46 , the @entity47 and the @entity48			1
with its ability to avoid regulatory restraints on its marketing strategies , the tobacco industry has considerable clout			1
and it would do everything it takes to beat back government policies that threaten its continued recruitment or retention of smokers			0
in 2009 , @entity62 passed a law that would allow the @entity64 to add warnings about smoking on cigarette packages , including a 1 - 800 - quit - now hot line for smokers who want help with quitting			2
when the @entity64 required that tobacco companies put stronger graphic warning labels on cigarette packages , the industry sued , citing infringement of the @entity73			1
the court ruled in february that the government can not require tobacco companies to use stronger labels			2
given the legal setback , the question is whether the government can still somehow fulfill the legislative mandate , which was already compromised by lobbying that forced , for example , the omission of menthol from the banned additive substances in tobacco			2
( as a result , the tobacco industry can continue exploiting new smokers , especially minority groups , with soothing menthol cigarettes that would otherwise be less appealing to smoke			1
) with the congressional mandate in limbo , @entity2 's initiative comes at just the right time			1
by launching this campaign on television , in print and on the @entity101 , it is making up for what the @entity64 can not do at this point			0
as states and communities are hard hit by declining budgets , fighting @entity104 demands not only commitment , but also creativity and ingenuity			0
perhaps one day , our courts will allow the government to add graphic warning messages about smoking on tobacco products			1
other countries , such as @entity117 and @entity118 , have instituted those kinds of labels and have seen an effective reduction in smoking			0
join us on @entity125 / @entity124 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity128 .			0

the @entity2 launched a new anti-smoking campaign
@entity132 : this is a smart move , since the tobacco industry has a lot of clout
