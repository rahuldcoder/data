on sunday , a man shot and killed a 14 - year - old boy and his grandfather at the @entity3 and then drove to a nearby @entity3 retirement community where he shot and killed a third person			1
police arrested a suspect , @entity7 , who shouted " @entity9 " after he was taken into custody			2
@entity7 , who also goes by @entity7 , is a well - known right wing extremist who founded the @entity12 and the @entity12 , according to the @entity13			2
now let 's do the thought experiment in which instead of shouting " @entity9 " after he was arrested , the suspect had shouted " @entity16			1
" only two days before the first anniversary of the @entity21 bombings , this simple switch of words would surely have greatly increased the extent and type of coverage the incident received			0
yet the death toll in the shootings in @entity28 is similar to that of last year 's @entity21 bombings , where three people were killed and the suspects later killed a police officer as they tried to evade capture			2
( many more , of course , were also wounded in the @entity37 attacks ; 16 men , women and children lost limbs			2
) in fact , since 9/11 extremists affiliated with a variety of far - right wing ideologies , including white supremacists , anti-abortion extremists and anti-government militants , have killed more people in the @entity50 than have extremists motivated by @entity53 's ideology			1
according to a count by the @entity56 , right wing extremists have killed 34 people in the @entity50 for political reasons since 9/11			1
( the total includes the latest shootings in @entity28 , which are being classified as a hate crime )			2
by contrast , terrorists motivated by @entity53 's ideology have killed 21 people in the @entity50 since 9/11			1
( although a variety of left wing militants and environmental extremists have carried out violent attacks for political reasons against property and individuals since 9/11 , none have been linked to a lethal attack , according to research by the @entity56			1
) moreover , since 9/11 none of the more than 200 individuals indicted or convicted in the @entity50 of some act of jihadist terrorism have acquired or used chemical or biological weapons or their precursor materials , while 13 individuals motivated by right wing extremist ideology , one individual motivated by left - wing extremist ideology , and two with idiosyncratic beliefs , used or acquired such weapons or their precursors			1
opinion : why do racists and anti-semites kill ? a similar attack to the one that @entity7 is accused of in @entity28 occurred in august 2012 when @entity96 @entity95 killed six people in a shooting at a @entity100 temple in @entity101			2
page was a member of a white supremacist band and associated with the @entity104 , a white supremacist group			0
page committed suicide during the attack			0
page is not , of course , the only right wing extremist to have used lethal violence to achieve political ends			2
in 2009 , for instance , @entity114 , @entity115 , and @entity116 raided a house in @entity119 , killing @entity114 and his daughter @entity120			0
the three attackers sought to use the burglary to finance their anti-immigration vigilante group , @entity114			0
@entity124 and @entity116 were convicted and sentenced to death			0
@entity115 was sentenced to life in prison			0
also in 2009 , @entity128 murdered dr. @entity129 , who ran an abortion clinic in @entity131 , @entity28			2
in 2010 @entity128 was convicted of first - degree murder			0
according to the @entity13 , @entity128 not only had ties to the extreme anti-abortion movement , but he also had been pulled over while driving with a fake license plate bearing the markings of the @entity137 , a movement of individuals who deny that the government has authority over them			0
of course , the deadliest terrorist attack on @entity50 soil prior to 9/11 was the @entity145 bombing , which was masterminded by @entity146 , a man with deep ties to far - right militant circles			1
@entity146 killed 168 people when he bombed the @entity151 federal building on april 19 , 1995			0
despite this history of deadly violence by individuals motivated by political ideologies other than @entity53 , it is jihadist violence that continues to dominate the news and the attention of policy makers			1
some of this is quite understandable			0
after all , on 9/11 @entity53 's 19 terrorists killed almost 3,000 people in the space of a morning			1
since then @entity53 's branch in @entity166 tried to bring down with a bomb secreted on a passenger an @entity50 commercial jet flying over @entity170 on christmas day 2009 and @entity53 's branch in @entity172 tried to launch bombings on the @entity175 subway system a few months earlier			1
luckily those plots did n't succeed , but certainly if they had the death toll would have been on a large scale			0
yet the disparity in media coverage between even failed jihadist terrorist attacks and this latest incident in @entity28 is emblematic of a flawed division in the public 's mind between killing that is purportedly committed in the name of @entity188 and killing that is committed for other political ends , such as @entity192 beliefs about the need to kill @entity194			1
part of the reason for this disconnect might be that when a @entity199 report warning of violent right wing extremism was leaked in 2009 , it generated a substantial political controversy			0
in a 2011 interview with the @entity13 , @entity202 , the leader of the team that produced the report , argued that following the controversy , @entity199 's examination of such threats suffered , stating " since our report was leaked , @entity199 has not released a single report of its own on this topic			0
not anything dealing with @entity215 domestic extremism â€” whether it 's anti-abortion extremists , white supremacists , ' sovereign citizens , ' eco-terrorists , the whole gamut			0
" the threat from @entity53 and its associated forces has changed significantly since 9/11			2
today , almost 13 years after 9/11 , @entity53 has not successfully conducted another attack inside the @entity50			1
and since 2011 , no individual charged with plotting to conduct an @entity53 - inspired terrorist attack inside the @entity50 has acted with more than one accomplice			1
this demonstrates the difficulties today of forming a jihadist group sufficiently large enough to conduct a complex attack anything on the scale of 9/11 , and is a tribute to the success of law enforcement agencies in detecting and deterring jihadist terrorist activity			0
today in the @entity50 , @entity53 - type terrorism is the province of individuals with no real connection to foreign terrorists , aside from reading their propaganda online			1
given this , it becomes harder to explain , in terms of @entity50 national security , why violence by homegrown right wing extremists receives substantially less attention than does violence by homegrown jihadist militants			1

@entity256 , @entity257 : man killed three at @entity3 *centers* in @entity28
@entity261 shouted " @entity9 ; " if it had been " @entity16 " media would cover it more , they say
since 9/11 , right wing extremists have killed more in @entity50 than those motivated by @entity53
writers : given this , why do we not give more national security attention to right wing attacks ?
