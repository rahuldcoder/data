it 's a scary statement -- one that 's received a lot of attention in recent years , although some say the concern is unwarranted			0
after prodding from consumer groups , the @entity8 has conducted their own investigation and is proposing a maximum limit for arsenic levels in apple juice			1
the @entity8 plans to limit the amount of inorganic arsenic to 10 parts per billion -- the same amount the @entity17 allows in drinking water			1
this is the first time the @entity8 has set limits for arsenic levels in food or drink products			1
the move comes two years after an episode of " the dr. @entity26 " raised public concern about the amount of arsenic in children 's apple juice			1
the show tested three dozen samples of five brands of juice and found some contained arsenic levels between 11 and 36 parts per billion			1
shortly after , @entity39 released a study that analyzed 88 samples of apple and grape juice			2
the researchers found about 10 % of the samples had arsenic levels higher than 10 parts per billion			1
there are two types of arsenic : inorganic and organic			2
inorganic arsenic has been classified as a human carcinogen by the @entity17			1
the @entity8 describes organic , or naturally - occurring arsenic as " essentially harmless			2
" " this chemical element is found in the @entity62 's crust , " @entity55 , the @entity8 's deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine , wrote on the government agency 's blog			2
" it 's everywhere in the environment and can be found in water , air and soil , in both organic and inorganic forms			2
human activities also can introduce arsenic into the environment			0
" although the @entity8 's new rules are not yet in effect , the agency says parents should n't be worried			0
last year they analyzed the arsenic levels in 94 samples of apple juice			1
the analysis showed that 95 % of the samples tested were below 10 parts per billion for both organic and inorganic arsenic ; 100 % of the samples were below 10 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic			2
" @entity94 juice producers , as well as the @entity8 , want people to know they can be confident that apple juice is safe , " @entity88 , president of the @entity89 , said in a statement , noting that juice companies routinely test their products			1
" @entity96 is a naturally occurring element in the environment and may be found in the air , soil and water			0
it is commonly found in harmless , trace amounts in many crops and naturally sourced foods			0
humans have been exposed to it for thousands of years			0
" long - term exposure to arsenic , which is odorless and tasteless , has been linked to cancer of the bladder , skin , kidney , nasal passages , liver and prostate , according to the @entity17			1
scientists also know that arsenic can affect the nervous system , causing headaches , numbness and tremors , and can damage your blood vessels			0
there is also some evidence that frequent exposure could lower children 's iq levels , the @entity125 says			0
the association also notes in the statement that holding apple juice to the same arsenic guidelines as drinking water is n't appropriate because people consume more water on a regular basis			1
in 2011 , @entity39 released a study that analyzed 88 samples of apple and grape juice			0
the researchers found about 10 % of the samples -- including ones from well - known brands -- had arsenic levels higher than 10 parts per billion			1
@entity149 , the publisher of @entity39 , has advocated since then for a 3 parts per billion limit but said in a statement that it is happy with the @entity8 's " reasonable first step			0
" the @entity156 recommends babies under 6 months of age not drink any type of juice , and that children 1 to 6 years old should have no more than 4 to 6 ounces a day			0
the @entity8 has to accept public comments on their proposal for 60 days before these recommendations can be implemented .			0
