he was honorably discharged for medical reasons after a brief tour and returned to the @entity4 to study political science and train for 1,500 - meter races			1
but something was n't right			1
" i was going to school with kids who look the same , were the same age as me , but we were n't the same , " he said			1
" i wanted more of a challenge , a sense of purpose			1
" portraits of conflict : can an image stop the bloodshed ? in 2010 , @entity13 took time off and began his certification as an emergency medical technician			2
in the two years that followed , he fell in love , got married and quickly divorced			1
devastated and heartbroken , he went back to school , but he could n't shake his depression			2
" i needed a game - changer , " he said			2
he decided he would head to @entity133 , follow the situation in @entity33 and try to help			2
so , on his spring break this year he packed his medical kit and flew into the @entity138 capital			2
the next two weeks were filled with eye - opening misadventures as @entity13 began to scratch the surface of the complexities of the @entity33 conflict and the @entity19 as a whole			2
founded a humanitarian aid organization " i had learned enough to know that i did n't know anything , " he said			2
after finishing the semester back in the @entity4 , he returned to @entity138 , only this time with a plan			2
" the way i saw it , i did n't have a choice			2
this is what i was put here to do			2
i guess i am just a hopeless romantic , and i am an idealist , and i believe in hopeless causes			2
" @entity13 then founded @entity77 , and in summer 2013 he moved its base of operations to @entity157 , @entity158			2

" i am not a doctor			0
i am not a nurse , " he said in the 2012 interview			0

this is something for me that has meaning , that has purpose			0
" converted to @entity12 @entity13 's family said he converted to @entity12 while being held hostage and now goes by @entity9			1

others were the innocent victims of a spiraling conflict			0
one patient , 24 - year - old @entity193 , said she and her three children were run over by a military jeep as they tried to escape the @entity33 military siege of their village			0

despite dangers , doctors honor oath in a secret @entity33 field hospital he bonded with doctors , patients @entity13 said his direct exposure to what was something of an alien conflict and culture before transformed his perspective			0
" there is this mentality from where i come from back home that i have a little bit of a problem with , " he said			0
" i do n't want to get on a political soap box , but at the same time we have to think about why as a country we choose to help certain people and not others			0
" we have to think about why we just chalk up the @entity19 [ as ] this complex enigma that we will never understand because they are so different from us			0
but at the end of the day , they are really not			0
it 's just about whether or not you 're willing to go out on a limb and understand something , " he said			0
" @entity3 can tell the @entity4 people who we are , " said @entity240 , a @entity33 nurse he worked with			1
" we are not what the regime says we are -- terrorists and @entity246			0
@entity3 knows we are good people , who love joking and laughter			1
we just want to live			0
" @entity13 was struck by the resilience of the @entity33 he met , by their ability to smile and somehow joke even in the darkest of circumstances			0
" this is real , and it 's scary stuff , and it 's sad what is happening to people here , " he said			0
" people back home need to know about it , they need to know			0

" when outrage is n't enough your take : intervene or not ?			0
