-- conventional wisdom can be a dangerous thing			0
the media and political chattering class are rushing to explain how @entity5 house majority leader @entity5 could lose his primary election to a relatively unknown challenger			1
no one saw it coming			0
and apparently it 's not enough to just bask in the shock			2
but this loss is not just about immigration reform or even the tea party			2
it 's about the insanely unpopular @entity19 leadership in @entity20 and one of its figureheads , who increasingly made little legislative progress for @entity25 or for his district			2
yes , in the waning hours of the campaign , immigration was a key issue			0
but a poll taken on election night shows that fully 72 % of @entity5 's very @entity19 district support immigration reform including a path to citizenship			1
conservative commentator @entity35 tweeted tuesday night , and followed up with a blog post today , confirming that @entity5 's loss had nothing to do with immigration reform -- though conservatives would happily exploit that narrative			1
indeed , @entity42 sen. @entity42 , a far stronger and more consistent supporter of immigration reform , handily won his primary last night in a much more conservative voting bloc			2
spreading the myth that @entity5 lost because of his ( wavering , undefined and weak ) support for immigration reform not only does harm to the truth but serves to create a self - fulfilling prophecy in which immigration reform is now dead in @entity20			1
it need not be and should not be if voters have any real say in our country -- or if @entity19 hope to show leadership on our nation 's challenges and win over the future of the @entity25 electorate			2
but alas , this thinking reflects what really suffered in this race : the shell of our political system , already dreadfully hobbled by @entity19 intransigence , will further grind to a halt			1
this is also not necessarily , as noted , because @entity5 's challenger @entity70 was backed by the tea party			1
brat was overlooked and brushed aside by most of the national tea party infrastructure -- they hardly showed up			0
brat himself tuesday night on @entity77 boasted himself as a traditional @entity19			0
certainly @entity78 was supported by local tea party enthusiasts , but he was not exactly waving nor wrapping himself in their @entity80 ( " @entity82 " ) flag			0
arguably , the reasons for @entity5 's demise are more subtle -- and ultimately hold even more danger for the @entity19 and the nation			1
as @entity88 wrote wednesday for @entity89 , @entity5 had largely abandoned his constituents in favor of growing his national profile			1
remember that @entity5 had radically undermined disaster funding just before a surprising and deadly earthquake rocked his own district			1
and @entity5 was too busy trying to slash all government funding to use any constructively for the other need of his constituents			1
meanwhile on issue after issue , there was a sense that voters could n't trust @entity5 -- because he , like his party , constantly flip - flopped on every issue in a vain attempt to placate his increasingly vocal right flank			1
beyond that , there 's a conflation of gripes here			0
conservative @entity19 were increasingly frustrated by @entity19 leadership in general and @entity5 in specific , not courting and honoring the more ideologically entrenched voices within their rank			1
at the same time , @entity25 of all political stripes -- including arguably moderate @entity19 -- were increasingly frustrated by a do - nothing @entity19 solely committed to political grandstanding while utterly refusing to solve any of the nation 's pressing problems			2
and this is where the @entity19 -- not to mention the good of our country --- are really in long - term danger			0
we need ( at least two ) political parties in the @entity25 that wrestle over the big challenges and needs of @entity25 and , yes , at times actually pass legislation and get things done			0
voters are extraordinarily frustrated that 's not happening , and they rightly blame the gridlock on @entity19			0
it will now only get worse			0
absolutely no one , not even @entity19 voters , likes what this @entity20 is doing to this country			0
@entity5 was n't conservative enough for the increasingly extremist @entity19 base but was simultaneously too extreme for the mainstream of voters			1
now his party will move further to the right and away from responsible leadership			0
that 's bad for @entity19 and bad for @entity25 .			0

@entity145 says @entity5 's surprising loss does n't mean what you think it means
what suffered in this race is the shell of our political system , now grinding to a halt , @entity145 says
@entity5 was n't conservative enough for base but too extreme for everyone else , @entity145 says
