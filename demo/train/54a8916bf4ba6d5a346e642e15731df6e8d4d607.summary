-- is the music festival as scene of warm beer , ear - drum - shattering amplification and mud - splattered mayhem under threat ? with @entity10 's @entity9 - educated conservative prime minister , @entity8 , spotted at @entity11 -- aka @entity12 -- this year , @entity14 tickets costing upward of $ 300 and yurts and hempseed smoothies present at even the most ordinary events , all the evidence is there			1
at these popular upscale music and culture fests in @entity10 ( the country seems to specialize in them ) and @entity25 , guests are as well - bred as the organic cows minced up for the burgers , the music avoids topics of social revolution and the booze may be bubbly , but it also tends to be @entity31			1
@entity32 , @entity33 , @entity10 " a homespun melting pot where music - lovers share pies and a glass of champagne with superstars , toffs , rockers , crooners [ and ] @entity44 dancers			1
" that 's how @entity11 describes itself			2
known as " poshstock , " especially since @entity10 prime minister @entity8 was spotted there this year ( albeit apparently hiding behind a pair of fake @entity51 sunglasses ) , the festival places great emphasis on comfort			1
with accommodation options including yurts ( yes , the surprise accommodation hit of the decade has even made it to this bastion of the @entity10 establishment ) and fully furnished cabins , you feel as if you 're checking into a charming little boutique hotel here , rather than attending a three - day open - air music festival			1
yoga workshops are available , should you suffer any back strain catching a glimpse of acts including @entity70 and the @entity71			0
the @entity73 tent has plush sofas and a hair salon if you get too out of sorts			0
@entity32 ; every july ; day tickets from £ 15 ( $ 23 ) ; +44 ( 0 ) 844 581 0777 @entity79 6 , @entity80 , @entity81 " your weekend will be spent in the most stylish ... setting imaginable , " declares @entity79 6 -- without modesty , true , but also without too much exaggeration			0
held in the achingly ( literally , to some ) quaint @entity81 village of @entity80 , a purpose - built resort modeled on an @entity88 village , venues include a ballroom and a " piazza			1
" accommodation ranges from @entity92 ( now , a castle really is n't @entity14 1978 ) to , inevitably , " luxury yurts			2
" among performance highlights at this year 's " intimate , bespoke banquet of music , arts and culture , " to quote the giddy festival organizers again , are the @entity101 , travel writer @entity44 and harpist @entity102			1
@entity103 6 ; every september ( 13 - 15 in 2013 ) ; tickets from £ 170 ( $ 265 ) @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 held in the grounds of the city 's medieval castle , @entity108 is a global highlight on the opera lover 's calendar			1
singers might hit the high notes but you should n't get carried away by all the extravagant emotion depicted in the opera performances -- the prevailing mood here is genteel , just in the way it is n't at , say , the @entity125 heavy metal festival in @entity126 , @entity10			1
highlight of this year 's @entity108 lineup is the @entity130 opera @entity131 , performed by the @entity132			2
@entity133 ; every september ( 6 - 8 in 2013 ) ; tickets from € 25 ( $ 33 ) @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity10 " we @entity10 love our stately homes , " says the 45 - year - old director of this @entity136 event , @entity137			1
" give us a fine tune , a glass of something nice to drink and a posh house , and we 're the happiest folk in the world			2
" thus is the posh - festival ethos perfectly articulated			1
apart from the venue , @entity152 stately home , the culinary approach here is about as starkly different from the lukewarm beer and equally lukewarm food of what some would regard as a properly grimy festival			2
everything is resolutely local , seasonal , " artisan " and @entity158 , from the tea and cakes from the @entity161 , to the @entity163 coffee and the really rather annoyingly titled @entity164			0
@entity135 ; every august ( 23 - 25 in 2013 ) ; tickets from £ 20 ( $ 31 ) @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 the @entity170 website calls @entity172 " boutique , " which sounds about right			2
you wo n't find soggy burgers , or even organic ones			0
all forest herbs and fungi , @entity177 grub is front of the queue for discerning foodies at the moment , and @entity184 shows it off with pretentious elan			0
head chef at @entity167 's @entity190 - starred @entity189 restaurant , @entity186 is one of the culinary crew keeping hungry -- but picky -- festival - goers happy			1
the festival venue is a historic @entity167 park containing the ruins of a medieval church			0
true , there 's a camping ground -- but it has a pool and @entity199			0
with a nod to pre-organic - certified festivals of old , this year 's lineup included graying rockers @entity203 and @entity205			1
@entity166 ; every august ; day tickets from 725 kroner ( $ 130 ) @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 held in the aptly named @entity209 town of @entity208 , @entity210 is a three - day dance festival with a difference			1
no doubt other substances will be consumed to augment the electronic beats , but the food is hugely different from the greasy takeaways that so often accompany a clubbing night out			0
the pop - up onsite restaurant @entity219 serves food by the eponymous @entity190 - starred @entity209 chef @entity221 ; there 's a festival bakery ; and gluten - free food can be ordered in advance for those sensitive types			1
@entity207 ; every july ; tickets from € 82 ( $ 110 ) @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity10 " black ties			1
generous servings of decadence , garnished with sophistication			0
" thus the @entity228 sets the scene for festival - goers " in the know			2
" or , to put it another way , well off festival - goers			2
this posh @entity33 bash completes the @entity242 every year , a rowing race whose entrants and spectators share a good concentration of blue blood			0
you can spear moules frites and other @entity31 delicacies prepared by celebrated father and son chefs @entity255 and @entity256 while listening to @entity257 and the @entity258 , among other acts			0
@entity228 ; every july ; tickets from £ 52 ( $ 80 ) @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 all pretty evening gowns and penguin suits , this elite classical music event takes place every summer in a little @entity269 town in that home of all things pricey , @entity263			0
big ticket performers have included @entity273 , @entity274 and the young @entity276 classical star @entity275			0
tapas on slate platters are among the superior servings at two pop - up restaurants			0
interval chat could cover limited - edition time pieces and travel -- to other tax havens around the world , that is			1
you wo n't find many camping enthusiasts here -- where would one hang one 's designer gown ? -- but there are plenty of upscale chalets to rent in the village and around			2
@entity261 ; from july to august each year ; tickets from 50 francs ( $ 55 ) @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity10 the word " twee " inevitably suggests itself when describing this festival of music and the arts set in and around yet another stately home			1
a sample of the non-headbanging performances on show include the poet @entity306 , gentle satirist of yummy mummies and inbred aristocratic politicians , and a capella versions of pop songs from the @entity311			0
exhibits , when you tire of all that noise , have included a collection of dolls owned by various legendary fashion designers			0
@entity319 , watch out ! @entity296 ; every july ; tickets from £ 20 ( $ 31 )			0
