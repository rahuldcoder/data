-- a major international environmental group has pulled out of the process to guarantee that diamonds do not come from conflict zones , saying the @entity5 had refused " to evolve and address the clear links between diamonds , violence and tyranny			1
" so why are so - called " conflict diamonds " so controversial ? what are conflict diamonds ? conflict or " blood " diamonds are illegally traded to fund conflict in war - torn areas , particularly in central and western @entity17 , according to the @entity18 , which represents the commercial diamond trade			1
the @entity20 defines conflict diamonds as " ... diamonds that originate from areas controlled by forces or factions opposed to legitimate and internationally recognized governments , and are used to fund military action in opposition to those governments , or in contravention of the decisions of the @entity31			1
" they are generally in " rough " form , meaning they have recently been extracted and not yet cut			0
at the height of the civil war in @entity38 , it is estimated that conflict diamonds represented approximately four percent of the world 's diamond production			1
who suffers ? apart from the innocent people caught up in the conflicts that the trade fuels , thousands of men , women and children in countries such as @entity38 are used as slaves to extract diamonds			1
they are often forced to use primitive , back - breaking methods such as digging into mud or gravel along river banks with their bare hands			0
the collected material is then separated using hand - held sieves			0
what is the @entity5 ? the @entity5 started when @entity62 diamond - producing states met in @entity63 , @entity17 , in may 2000 , to discuss ways to stop the trade in conflict diamonds and ensure that diamond purchases were not funding violence			1
the result was an agreement by the @entity20 , @entity71 , the governments of 74 countries , the @entity18 -- representing the industry -- and a number of interest groups such as @entity77			0
they established the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) , whereby members are required to certify that all rough diamond exports are produced through legitimate mining and sales activities and are " conflict - free			1
" each shipment carries a certificate that details where the diamonds came from , how they were mined , where they were cut and polished , the parties involved , and their ultimate destination			0
the idea is that members of the @entity5 can not trade with non-members			2
is it working ? according to @entity94 of @entity77 , the @entity5 has yet to demonstrate itself capable of stopping the trade because of a lack of political will among member states			1
" @entity106 , for example , is a test case for the @entity5 , " she told @entity0 in 2010 , alleging that @entity101 's regime has benefited from the sale of blood diamonds despite it being a member of the @entity5			1
she said the huge @entity109 diamond fields of eastern @entity106 are operated by military - run syndicates who beat or kill miners who do n't mine for them or pay bribes			0
the extreme violence perpetrated by the military even included the mass murder of hundreds of miners by helicopter gunships , she added			0
but with just one or two member states able to veto any punitive action against abuses or infringements of the @entity5 scheme , no decisive action has been taken against @entity106			2
" this consensus decision - making means tough decisions do n't get made , " said @entity127			0
" certain countries are putting economic and political interests in front of defending the fundamental principles of the scheme			0
" is the " conflict trade " limited to diamonds ? no. according to @entity77 , rebel fighters and army units have hijacked the trade in mineral ores , used in the production of mobile phones and computers , from eastern @entity143 ( @entity143 ) , while subjecting the local population to massacres , rape , extortion , and forced labor			2
the " conflict minerals " are then laundered into the global supply chain by export houses , before being transformed into refined metals by large international smelting firms			2
@entity77 says the operations of some of the world 's leading consumer brands are now being scrutinized for evidence of links to this rogue trade .			0
