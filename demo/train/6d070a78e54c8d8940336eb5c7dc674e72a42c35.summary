-- a trial examining the @entity3 's stop - and - frisk policy headed to a judge monday after attorneys delivered their closing arguments after nine weeks of testimony			1
the federal class - action lawsuit claims that police officers routinely stop minority men , particularly black and @entity11 men , without legal reasons			1
the police department says that the policy -- in which police stop , question and frisk people they consider suspicious -- is used to deter crime			1
the practice has been widely criticized			0
the lead plaintiff in the case is @entity24 , a medical student who was stopped twice , once in the middle of the afternoon when he was in front of his home in the @entity28 , according to the suit , which was filed in 2008			0
closing arguments monday were marked by conflicting accounts of stop - and - frisk incidents			1
for example , while attorneys for the @entity36 argued that one man was stopped because he appeared to be smoking marijuana , the plaintiffs ' attorneys argued that he was simply talking on a cell phone			0
the @entity41 , a nonprofit civil rights law practice , is arguing on behalf of the plaintiffs			0
another man was reportedly stopped because he fit the description of a wanted man in a high - crime area with a recent string of burglaries , but the plaintiffs ' attorneys argued that he was more than a mile from where the burglaries occurred and that the last burglary in that area occurred more than 25 days earlier			2
@entity3 officers say they had stop - and - frisk quotas additionally , while city attorneys argued that many of those patted down gave their consent to the officers , the plaintiffs ' lawyers countered by saying that none of the 12 witnesses who were stopped ever felt free to leave			1
both sides argued that the accounts of events had changed since depositions were first taken			0
the nine weeks of testimony included secret recordings from officers ; statements from 41 police officials and 12 witnesses ; and expert opinions from criminal investigators			0
testimonies included emotional accounts from men who say police stopped them for no reason and from police officers who say quotas forced them to make unnecessary stops			0
in the recordings , which were played in court by the plaintiffs ' lawyers , supervising officers can be heard saying they want " more 250s , " referring to the form that officers fill out when they conduct a stop , question and frisk			2
city attorneys say that officers operate within the law , going where the crime is , and that crime happens to be higher in minority neighborhoods			2
during closing arguments , they contended that 88 % of stops are justified and that there have been no legitimate indications of racial motivations			1
they argued that the plaintiffs ' accounts of stop - and - frisk incidents were " woefully lacking in substantive evidence " and " failed to show a single constitutional violation			1
" rather than quotas , the attorneys claimed , the department used performance goals , which are legitimate management tools			0
" we need to have performance goals to keep the city safe , " said city attorney @entity114			0
though 12 witnesses testified regarding a total of 19 stop - and - frisk incidents , city attorneys pointed out that in seven of the 19 stops , the officers could not be identified			1
@entity3 report : most are minorities " no real conclusions can be drawn when only half of the story is told , " said @entity114			2
the lawsuit seeks to reform stop - and - frisk under the supervision of a court - appointed monitor			1
during their closing statements , the plaintiffs ' attorneys argued that " the @entity3 believes that race is a proxy for reasonable suspicion			2
" according to plaintiffs ' attorneys , the lawsuit is not about ending stop - and - frisk but examining how the police department conducts those stops and whether it stops blacks and @entity146 in violation of the @entity148			1
@entity150 ' attorney @entity149 told the court that over the past eight years , blacks and @entity146 constituted 85 % of the people stopped , though 90 % of those stopped were neither arrested nor given a court summons			0
only 1 % resulted in the recovery of a weapon and 0.14 % resulted in the recovery of a gun			0
" clearly the @entity3 is n't stopping the right people to get guns off the street , " @entity149 said			2
however , @entity114 noted that reasonable suspicion can still occur even if no gun is found			0
@entity150 ' attorneys maintained that police officers feel pressure to stop and frisk to meet supervisor demands , which consequently results in the unlawful and unjustified stopping of @entity36 residents			2
" they stopped first and invented reasons later , " @entity149 said			0
according to the @entity170 , the police department logged its 5 millionth stop - and - frisk under mayor @entity172 in march			1
attorneys will be given approximately three weeks to submit any additional paperwork			0
@entity176 district judge @entity175 did not specify when she expected to reach a decision , except that it would be " prompt			1
" changed outlined @entity3 's ' stop , question , frisk ' policy @entity0 's @entity183 contributed to this report .			1

federal trial testing @entity3 's " stop - and - frisk " policy hears closing arguments
plaintiffs say the policy fell *disproportionately* on black and @entity11 men
the city says the policy helps to deter crime and is not racially *biased*
the @entity176 district judge says her decision will be " prompt "
