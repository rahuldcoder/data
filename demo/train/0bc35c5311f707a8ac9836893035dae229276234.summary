-- the @entity2 countryside -- still green , still rolling , still packed with charming eccentrics -- is more appealing than ever these days , as overwhelmed urbanites are flooding the area in search of a rural idyll			1
it 's been more than 100 years since @entity11 wrote , " anybody can be good in the country			1
there are no temptations there			0
" these days , all irony aside , quite the opposite is true			0
the shires are far from unsophisticated , even if one still must trade @entity18 for @entity19 when taking those long country walks			1
the best new additions to the area -- like the ones assembled here -- respect their past , no matter how thoroughly modern they might be			0
from the dells of @entity28 to the wooded countryside of @entity30 , from charming @entity32 villages to the @entity34 ' wild northern moors , the evidence is manifold			1
crumbling estates have been restored into plush , contemporary hotels			0
and more are still to come : the @entity38 - designed @entity37 debuts near @entity39 in may , and a year from now , @entity42 hand @entity40 will open @entity43 in @entity30			1
such is the mood afoot in @entity45 , with old - fashioned pubs serving inventive cuisine and upscale stores and spas catering to a cosmopolitan crowd			1
today , @entity11 be damned , the @entity2 countryside is very tempting indeed			1

before becoming a hotel in 2003 , the house was the longtime residence of garden designer @entity68 , who filled the 11 - acre grounds with purple alliums and weeping cherry trees ; now the hotel 's bold interiors have been redone to better reflect @entity68 's aesthetic			1
garden - inspired furniture and soft creams and whites play off honeyed stone , and the spa pays further homage to @entity68 with treatments that highlight the rejuvenating power of plants			1
the nearby @entity85 , from the same owners , consistently delivers a cozy atmosphere and very good seasonal food , such as @entity89 crab , ham hock salad or a bowl of clams and mussels with @entity32 cider , parsley and cream			0

a new tradition : @entity104 , @entity30 @entity105 is among the most desirable regions for wealthy @entity107 seeking weekend retreats , and there have long been good hotels here			1
now inns like @entity112 's at @entity113 ( themasterbuilders.co.uk ) offer some of the area 's top accommodations for less than $ 250 ( choice rooms are in the 18th - century main building )			1
but the big news is @entity119 , a 29 - room spot in the middle of the old - growth @entity122 that combines luxe design with seamless service			1
the interiors are by @entity127 -- known for doing the bars at several chic @entity58 hotels , including @entity130 's -- with sun - soaked ash rooms and an eclectic mix of antique and bespoke furniture			1

pastoral @entity142 : @entity143 , @entity56 on her 1,500 - acre @entity32 estate , designer @entity144 ( the force behind the popular @entity147 clothing lines ) has created @entity149 , a rural oasis dedicated to organic farming			1
beginning in 2003 with an upscale food market selling products cultivated on - site , @entity152 now has a caf√© , a cooking school and a clothing store , and it 's become a destination for a certain @entity58 sort ( @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 ) who makes the 90 - minute drive from the city or has a country home nearby			1
the real delight , though , is @entity168 , a tiny day spa and yoga studio with an ecoconscious sensibility : wool from @entity152 's sheep insulates the spa 's sustainable wood walls , and therapies feature organic , chemical - free products , many from the @entity180 line			1
treatments start at $ 80			0
@entity183 @entity144 's five - year - old @entity180 line of organic products is now available in the @entity186 at @entity187			1

but there 's no need to leave the property to play the sport of kings : @entity62 is the only hotel in the @entity212 that has its own polo fields ( built in the mid- 1980s by former resident , @entity215 owner @entity214 )			1
@entity62 guests can ride the grounds themselves and watch professional matches from april through september			0

so it comes as little surprise that the area is increasingly attracting @entity212 gastronomes , like @entity58 - based , @entity89 - born chef @entity246 , who opened this 45 - seat spot in 2008			1
perched above the horseshoe - shaped harbor , the restaurant has drawn a discriminating crowd , and @entity246 also hosts cooking demonstrations and supper clubs led by well - known writers , artists and chefs			2
