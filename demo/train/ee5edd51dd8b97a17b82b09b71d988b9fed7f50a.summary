-- the largest @entity2 outbreak in history has struck fear into the hearts of people around the world			1
while fewer than 3,000 people have been killed by the virus since it was discovered in 1976 , the disease 's virulence and deadliness , combined with the lack of a cure , inspire dread like almost no other			1
we asked you what questions you had about @entity2 and received more than 1,000 responses via social media			1
here are expert answers to some of your most common questions and concerns			1
what is @entity2 ? @entity26 describes @entity2 as " one of the world 's most deadly diseases			1
" " it is a highly infectious virus that can kill up to 90 % of the people who catch it , causing terror among infected communities , " @entity26 says			1
the ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever , which , according to the @entity37 , refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding			1
the virus is named after the @entity43 in the @entity44 ( formerly @entity44 ) , where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976			1
the @entity47 says there are five different strains of the virus , named after the areas where they originated			1
three of these have been associated with large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in @entity57			2
of @entity2 's five subtypes , the @entity44 strain -- the first to be identified -- is considered the most deadly			2
the @entity47 said preliminary tests on the ebola virus in @entity62 in march suggested that the outbreak there was this strain , though that has not been confirmed			1
what are @entity2 's symptoms ? early symptoms include sudden onset of fever , weakness , muscle pain , headaches and a sore throat			2
these symptoms can appear two to 21 days after infection			2
the @entity47 says these nonspecific early symptoms can be mistaken for signs of diseases such as malaria , typhoid fever , meningitis or even the plague			2
@entity26 says some patients may also develop a rash , red eyes , hiccups , chest pains and difficulty breathing and swallowing			1
the early symptoms progress to vomiting , diarrhea , impaired kidney and liver function and sometimes internal and external bleeding			0
@entity0 's dr. @entity97 says that if a patient is going to die from @entity2 , he or she usually does so within about 10 days			0
@entity2 can only be definitively confirmed by five different laboratory tests			0
how is it treated ? what about that experimental drug ? there are no specific approved treatments for @entity2			0
@entity26 says patients are isolated and then supported by health care workers			1
" this consists of hydrating the patient , maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure and treating them for any complicating infections , " it says			0
two @entity115 missionary workers infected with @entity2 were given an experimental drug called @entity117 , which seems to have saved their lives			0
the drug , developed by a @entity121 firm , had never been tried before on humans , but it showed promise in small experiments on monkeys			0
the @entity115 who received it have since been declared healthy and discharged from @entity127 in @entity128			0
@entity117 was also administered to three @entity130 health care workers who contracted @entity2			0
at first , they showed " very positive signs of recovery , " according to the @entity130 @entity133 , but one has since died of the disease			1
why have n't other patients been given the experimental drug ? an ethics panel convened by the @entity47 concluded it is ethical to give experimental drugs during an outbreak as large as this one , but that does n't mean it will happen			0
@entity144 out an untested drug during a massive outbreak would be very difficult , according to @entity26			1
experimental drugs are typically not mass - produced , and tracking the success of such a drug if used would require extra medical staff where resources are already scarce			0
@entity117 's maker says it has very few doses ready for patient use			0
what about a vaccine ? there is currently no approved vaccination against @entity2			0
at least one potential @entity2 vaccine has been tested in healthy human volunteers , according to @entity162 , a leading researcher at the @entity163			0
and last week , the @entity164 announced that a safety trial of another @entity2 vaccine will start as early as september			0
in march , the @entity164 awarded a five - year , $ 28 million grant to establish a collaboration between researchers from 15 institutions who were working to fight @entity2			0
learn more about @entity2 vaccines and treatments in development how does the ebola virus spread ? humans contract @entity2 through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans , like blood , sweat and feces			1
@entity26 epidemiologist @entity185 said outbreaks usually spread in areas where hospitals have poor infection control and limited access to resources such as running water			1
" people who become sick with it almost always know how they got sick : because they looked after someone in their family who was very sick -- who had diarrhea , vomiting and bleeding -- or because they were health staff who had a lot of contact with a sick patient , " she said			1
can it live outside a host ? @entity26 says that while the virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism , chlorine disinfection , heat , direct sunlight , soaps and detergents can kill it			1
can it travel through the air , like a common cold or the flu ? " this is not an airborne transmission , " said dr. @entity216 , director of @entity37 's @entity217			0
" there needs to be direct contact frequently with body fluids or blood			2
" what about planes ? can fellow passengers become infected if someone on the flight has the virus ? could @entity2 spread around the world via air travel ? while the @entity37 acknowledges it 's possible a person infected with @entity2 in @entity57 could get on a plane and arrive in another country , the chances of the virus spreading during the journey are low			2
" it 's very unlikely that they would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers , " said @entity238 , deputy director of @entity37 's @entity239 and @entity240			2
" the ebola virus spreads through direct contact with the blood , secretions , or other body fluids of ill people , and indirect contact -- for example with needles and other things that may be contaminated with these fluids			1
" travelers should take precautions by avoiding areas experiencing outbreaks and avoid contact with @entity2 patients			0
" it is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel , " the @entity261 said in a statement			0
" in the rare event that a person infected with the ebola virus was unknowingly transported by air , @entity47 advises that the risks to other passengers are low			1
nonetheless , @entity47 does advise public health authorities to carry out contact tracing in such instances			0
" this means determining who had contact with the affected person			0
what is the risk of catching @entity2 on a plane ? is @entity2 going to be our era 's plague or @entity284 ? is it the most dangerous disease on the planet ? not likely , says @entity97			2
" @entity2 is not the great plague ; there 's no question about that , " he explained			0
" the grim reality is that it often kills so quickly that people do n't have time to spread it			1
" " it 's a myth that @entity2 is the most dangerous disease that humans have ever encountered , " he added			2
" @entity296 , for example , certainly has killed more people , and up until recently , there was no treatment for that disease either			1
rabies , something that you can get from animals as well , if you develop symptoms , you 're very unlikely to survive			0
with @entity2 right now , about seven out of 10 people are dying ( in @entity62 ) , but not everybody			2
" dr. @entity97 on more @entity2 myths and truths if you survive @entity2 , are you immune , like chickenpox ? doctors believe surviving @entity2 leaves you immune to future infection			0
scientists have found that people who survive @entity2 have antibodies in their blood that would provide protection against that strain of the virus in the future , and possibly against other strains as well			1
but , as you can imagine , they have n't tested this theory by infecting survivors with the virus again			2
how do people react to @entity2 survivors ? @entity0 's @entity329 , who has been reporting on the outbreak in @entity57 , says those " lucky " enough to survive the disease frequently find that the stigma attached to @entity2 means they are ostracized once they recover			1
" they find it very difficult to come back to their communities and be accepted , because people just do n't believe that they have been cured , " she explains			2
" there 's a lot of superstition , a belief that @entity2 is almost a ' curse ' and that makes it much more difficult to deal with			0
" where did @entity2 start ? the @entity47 says it is believed that fruit bats may be the natural host of the ebola virus in @entity57 , passing on the virus to other animals			1
9 things to know about @entity2 are myths making the @entity2 outbreak worse ? what happens when you survive @entity2 ? timeline of the @entity2 outbreak @entity0 's @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity359 , @entity360 and @entity361 contributed to this report .			0

the ebola virus kills up to 90 % of people who catch it , according to @entity26
