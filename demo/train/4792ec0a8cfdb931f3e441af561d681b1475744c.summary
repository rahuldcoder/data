@entity0 -- a psychiatrist who treated @entity3 in the 1980s and who interviewed him in recent months described the presidential assailant tuesday as having " a sense of entitlement " and being " absorbed with himself			2
" during federal court testimony , dr. @entity9 also said @entity3 " dives right in " when it comes to romantic relationships with women , but has not always shown a lot of empathy toward them			1
federal prosecutors called @entity9 as an expert witness in their effort to block a proposal from @entity21 , the @entity0 mental hospital where @entity3 has undergone treatment for three decades , to increase @entity3 's periods of visitation to his mother 's home in @entity28 , @entity29 , and his possible eventual release as a permanent outpatient			1
in march of 1981 , @entity3 shot president @entity32 , his press secretary @entity32 , @entity33 agent @entity32 and @entity0 policeman @entity34			1
all four men survived , and @entity3 was found not guilty by reason of insanity @entity9 , the former director of forensics services at @entity21 , said @entity3 continues to suffer from both narcissistic and schizoid personality disorders			1
he said the latter problem has led @entity3 to be somewhat removed in personal relationships			0
in december , experts called by @entity3 's lawyers testified his two most serious mental problems -- major depressive disorder and an unspecified psychotic disorder -- are in full remission			1
@entity9 agreed with the diagnosis on the depressive disorder			0
he was more circumspect about the psychosis , saying his condition " tends not to present with obvious symptoms			0
" the psychiatrist said that in the late1990s he had recommended @entity3 start taking the antipsychotic drug @entity56 to prevent any new symptoms			0
that was of particular concern , @entity9 said , because @entity3 was leaving the hospital periodically			1
@entity3 is still taking that drug along with @entity62 for anxiety			0
@entity9 said that in his opinion , @entity3 " continues to be mentally ill now			1
" the issue of @entity3 's relationships with women has frequently come up during the discussion of increasing his freedom			0
witnesses have testified about his girlfriends , including a woman identified only as @entity73 , a former mental patient at @entity3 's hospital			1
@entity9 said @entity3 said he was engaged to @entity73 and was unhappy his mother would not allow her to visit him during his stays at her @entity29 home			1
@entity3 's mother was concerned @entity79 might have a mental breakdown			2
@entity9 said @entity3 showed " little regard " for his mother 's views			1
according to @entity9 , @entity3 said he had ended his engagement to @entity73 anticipating he would be spending more time at his mother 's and would not be able to see her there			1
@entity9 said he was not sure if @entity3 had , in fact , told @entity73 the engagement was over because she continues to visit him when he is at the hospital			1
the psychiatrist said he asked @entity91 what the impact would be on @entity73 if he were to go to @entity28 and no longer see her , and @entity3 replied that she has other friends			2
@entity9 said @entity3 showed " not a lot of empathy			2
" @entity3 's defense team will get a chance to question @entity9 on wednesday			2
in his opening arguments in late november , attorney @entity99 said the central issue is whether @entity3 is dangerous and said no one has offered any proof that he represents a danger to himself or others			0
@entity99 said @entity3 is " flawed , " but insisted he is " fundamentally decent			0
" @entity3 currently spends 10 days a month visiting his mother in @entity29			0
doctors at @entity21 have proposed the visits be increased , first to two stays totaling 17 days			0
that would be followed by six trips totaling 24 days			0
following the extended visits the hospital would like the authority to decide whether @entity3 can be released as a permanent outpatient			2
in december , @entity116 district court judge @entity115 said the decision should rest with him .			0
