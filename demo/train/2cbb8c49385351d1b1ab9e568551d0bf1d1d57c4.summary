-- the 84 million bright yellow wristbands distributed by @entity3 's cancer charity have become a well - known symbol of strength and perseverance against adversity			1
" @entity9 , " they urge			0
in the wake of wednesday 's release of hundreds of pages of evidence supporting persistent allegations of doping against the legendary cyclist , there 's another take on the wristband			1
critics have struck out the " v " to make it read what they accuse @entity3 of doing for more than a decade : " lie strong			2
" evidence of @entity3 doping ' overwhelming , ' agency says still , the flood of less - than - flattering details does n't seem to be shaking the resolve of fans accustomed to accusations that have swirled for more than a decade , accusations the seven - time winner of cycling 's most prestigious event -- the @entity35 -- has resolutely denied			1
the information released wednesday by the @entity37 is part of a report to international cycling officials supporting the organization 's request to strip @entity3 of his tour titles and other accolades			1
he is also subject to a lifetime ban on competition in events sanctioned by @entity51 @entity50 sports bodies			0
@entity3 's fans took to @entity53 and other social media venues to stand by the man many see less as an athletic titan and more as an inspirational cancer survivor who has raised millions for cancer research and assistance			1
" whether you did , or you did n't , you still won 7 tour titles , you never failed a test and what you have done to increase the awareness of cancer , is enormous , " one fan wrote on his @entity53 fan page			0
" believe me , no one can tarnish the good you have done , " wrote another			0
it 's too soon to tell what the release of evidence against @entity3 and his teammates , many of whom admitted doping , will ultimately have on @entity3 's charity efforts and his overall reputation			1
however , his foundation says contributions increased after his august announcement that he would give up fighting the @entity37 's investigation of him			2
" our donations have increased to nearly double their usual amount since august , " said @entity85 , spokeswoman for the @entity9			0
" he 's a person who helped change the perception of cancer survivors around the world			2
he 's done an incredible amount of good for people affected by cancer and nothing can change that , " she said			2
@entity3 won his seven @entity35 championships after being diagnosed in 1996 with testicular cancer , which spread to his lungs , lymph nodes , abdomen and brain			2
by december of that year , after months of surgery and treatment , doctors declared him cancer free			0
the following year , he established his foundation			0
three years after his diagnosis , @entity3 won the first of his seven @entity35 titles , thrilling and inspiring millions in his home country , where cycling is barely followed			2
his victory brought increased attention to the sport in the @entity51 and helped raised money and attention for cancer research worldwide			0
still , throughout it all , rumors and allegations of doping dogged the @entity125 native			2
in 2002 , a 21 - month investigation into allegations that @entity3 's team used banned substances during the @entity130 closed after finding no evidence of illegal drug use			1
the @entity133 released a report in 2006 clearing him of allegations from 1999			0
and in february , federal prosecutors in @entity137 closed a two - year investigation into the allegations without filing charges			0
in the latest investigation , the @entity37 said examination of old @entity3 blood samples seemed to indicated doping			1
its report also said @entity3 made a " financial agreement " to bury a positive test for a banned substance and accused the team of falsifying prescription records to cover corticosteroid use by @entity3			1
the file also contains affidavits from @entity3 's teammates implicating themselves , and @entity3 , in the cheating			1
@entity3 's teammates recount tricking drug testers the agency said its investigation " found proof beyond a reasonable doubt that @entity3 engaged in serial cheating through the use , administration and trafficking of performance enhancing drugs and methods and that @entity3 participated in running the @entity167 as a doping conspiracy			1
" " the evidence in the case against @entity3 is beyond strong ; it is as strong as , or stronger than , that presented in any case brought by @entity37 over the initial twelve years of @entity37 's existence , " said the organization , which is not a governmental agency but is designated by @entity175 as the country 's official anti-doping organization for @entity50 sports			1
@entity3 himself has n't commented directly on the case			2
he posted to @entity183 wednesday night , however , saying he was " hanging with my family , unaffected " and thinking about an upcoming event for his charity			0
his lawyer , @entity188 , called the agency 's report a " one - sided hatchet job " and a " government - funded witch hunt			0
" a spokesman for the @entity51 attorney 's office in @entity137 , which ran the investigation that was closed in february , declined to comment on whether the evidence released publicly wednesday would spur renewed interest in possible criminal sanctions against @entity3 or anyone else associated with the team			1
@entity202 , a former federal prosecutor and avid amateur cyclist himself , said he doubted the criminal case would be reopened			1
" the feds knew what @entity37 knew			0
@entity37 knew what the feds knew			0
so this is not new information to the prosecutors , i do n't think , " he said			0
in fact , he said , he suspects the information revealed wednesday is largely similar to what federal prosecutors unveiled			0
" this investigation against @entity3 , which you know involved multiple federal agencies and a very large , well - organized federal investigation and what has to be millions of dollars spent , came up with apparently not enough hard evidence to charge @entity3 with a parking ticket , " @entity202 said			1
still , the report has had an impact on some fans , for whom the evidence appeared to sour their opinion of @entity3			1
" i am sad and have finally accepted there really are no true heroes in our world , " one @entity53 fan wrote			0
" on behalf of pretty much everyone who has held you in high regard ... looked on as an idol in the wake of your excellence in your sport ... bought your books and aspired to be as ( successful ) as you are ... if the allegations are true then you have duped your country and fellow athletes , " wrote another			0
still , @entity247 , an expert in crisis communications , said he does not expect the accusations will have any significant impact on @entity3 's legacy			1
" he 's done amazing things for people with cancer , " @entity247 said			2
" he 's given a lot of people hope in this world			1
and to many millions of @entity51 and people around the world , @entity3 will always be a hero			1
and none of these allegations are ever going to change that			0
" @entity0 's @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
