your forecast for the next century : hotter , drier and hungrier , and the chance to turn down the thermostat is slipping away			0
that 's the latest conclusion from the @entity4 , which urged governments to address the " increasingly clear " threats posed by a warming climate before some options are closed off for good			1
the latest report from the @entity10 concluded that taking steps to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions blamed for rising temperatures could buy more time to adjust to a warmer world			2
cutting emissions now " increases the time available for adaptation to a particular level of climate change , " the report states			1
but it adds , " delaying mitigation actions may reduce options for climate - resilient pathways in the future			2
" " in many cases , we are not prepared for the climate - related risks that we already face , " @entity27 , the co-chaiman of the @entity10 working group behind the document , said in a statement accompanying the report			2
" investments in better preparation can pay dividends both for the present and for the future			0
" the summary for policymakers was released monday morning in @entity42 , @entity43			0
it 's the second part of the @entity10 's benchmark assessment of climate change , a document released every six years with the input of nearly 1,000 scientists			1
without checks on emissions , the impacts of climate change will be more severe , more likely , and possibly irreversible , it concludes			1
monday 's report underscores " that we have committed to a certain amount of warming , " said @entity58 , an energy and climate expert at the @entity62 - based @entity61			1
" over the next few decades , we are going to lock ourselves into a climate change commitment that is going to paint a very different world , depending on what we choose today , " @entity58 said			1
" the choices we make today are going to affect the risks we face through the rest of the century			0
" as a result , " @entity70 is emerging as central area in climate change research , " @entity58 said			1
but adaptation -- steps such as building sea walls , conserving water and designing cities for warmer climates -- has its limits , she said			0
" the report suggests some options are going to be too resource - intensive or too expensive , " she said			2
an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other emissions have driven average temperatures up by about 0.6 degrees @entity88 ( 1 degree fahrenheit ) since 1950 , the @entity10 says			2
the first part of its report , released in september , concluded that even a best - case scenario would result in an increase in global average temperatures of 1.6 c ; the worst - case scenario estimates a rise of 3.7 degrees @entity98 )			2
the idea that carbon emissions are changing the @entity102 's climate is politically controversial , but generally accepted as fact by the overwhelming majority of scientists			1
and as emissions continue to rise , driving up @entity109 concentrations in the atmosphere , the impacts will be more severe , more likely and possibly irreversible , monday 's report states			1
the summary of the full document -- which is more than 1,000 pages -- will be the premiere guide for lawmakers			0
it breaks down the expected impacts by continent and by categories such as marine life , agriculture and flood risks			0
and by diving into the specifics of the report , policymakers will be able to see what risks their specific locations face , as well as what adaptation and mitigation techniques could prove fruitful			0
" the real highlight is how many impacts there are , how widespread they are and how pervasive they are around the world , " said @entity132 , who studies adaptation at @entity61			0
in most cases , climate change will exacerbate existing problems , such as the availability of fresh water in @entity144			1
the authors conclude that glaciers will continue to shrink " almost worldwide , " affecting water supplies downstream			0
animals have begun shifting their habitats in response to a warming world , and key crops have been affected already , they wrote			0
colder climates may see increases in crop yields from longer growing seasons and milder temperatures , but the negative effects are expected to outweigh the positive , the report states			1
" in this report , the finding is the impacts of climate change are already widespread and consequential , " @entity132 said			1
the impacts wo n't be the same for everyone , and as usual , the world 's poor are more likely to be hurt			2
" climate - related hazards affect poor people 's lives directly through impacts on livelihoods , reductions in crop yields or destruction of homes and indirectly through , for example , increased food prices and food insecurity , " the report states			1
positive effects on the impoverished " are limited and often indirect			0
" for those people , the effects " will be catastrophic " unless emissions can be reduced , @entity132 said			0
carbon dioxide benchmark hits new heights , worries scientists opinion : is it time for international agreements to recognize national laws ?			0

@entity194 's running out to rein in climate change , @entity4 panel concludes
" a certain amount of warming " is locked in , expert says
without checks on emissions , the impacts may be irreversible , report states
losses outweigh gains for *farmers* and the poor , it concludes
