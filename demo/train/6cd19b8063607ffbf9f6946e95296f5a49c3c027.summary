@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 troops have fired into @entity6 territory at least four times in the last 10 months in cross-border skirmishes that they say are in response to shelling from inside @entity6 , @entity2 has learned			1
the revelation is likely to stoke already tense relations between @entity6 and the @entity4 , which hit a new low after a @entity14 airstrike last year killed 24 @entity6 soldiers along the volatile border			1
while the @entity21 and @entity20 , an @entity1 militant group operating from @entity6 's @entity19 province , are generally believed responsible for cross-border attacks against troops , an @entity1 army commander says @entity6 soldiers opened fire on him and his men as recently as april 14			1
" when we went near the border , we were attacked with an anti-aircraft gun and mortars by the @entity6 army from their checkpoints			0
we are not only attacked from the @entity6 soil , but we are also attacked by the @entity6 army , " @entity34 , an @entity1 army commander , told @entity2			2
" we just saw them with our own eyes that the @entity6 soldiers were firing at us and on the same day we reported to the @entity4			1
but the @entity4 told us that it was from the other side of the border and they did n't have the permission to conduct operations ... there , " he said			0
army lt. col. @entity46 , a spokesman for the @entity14 - led @entity47 , confirmed @entity1 soldiers were involved in a cross-border clash that day			2
he did not specify who opened fire upon the @entity1			0
@entity4 troops do , however , sometimes fire back into @entity6 , as confirmed during a recent visit by @entity2 to @entity53 in @entity1 's rugged @entity55 province			1
the commander at @entity0 , located just a few kilometers from the @entity6 border , said he has fired across the border in response to being shelled from inside @entity6			2
army capt. @entity61 said he did not know the exact number of times he returned fire			0
but when pressed by @entity2 , and asked whether it was correct to say that he had fired into @entity6 more than five times , he responded : " that sounds accurate			2
" the outpost is one of a handful along the @entity1 - @entity6 border , and the captain 's admission may indicate more cross-border violence than previously publicized			2
@entity46 , the @entity47 spokesman , said troops at @entity0 have fired into @entity6 four times since june 2011			1
@entity6 is aware of the cross-border skirmishes			0
gen. @entity78 , a spokesman for the @entity6 military , said he did not know the exact number of times @entity0 fired into @entity6 , but that four sounded accurate			1
a @entity4 official , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue , said they try to liaise with @entity6 military forces first			1
but that communication does not always happen , @entity78 said			0
he said that most of the time @entity4 officials or @entity14 inform @entity6 before firing across the border , but sometimes they do not and @entity6 military checkpoints are hit			1
@entity78 said he was unaware of the april 14 cross-border clash			0
@entity0 is named for fallen @entity94 spec. @entity93 -- the @entity96 linebacker turned soldier who was killed in a friendly fire incident in 2004 in @entity1 , near the border			0
relations between the @entity4 and @entity6 -- complicated at the best of times -- have become especially tense in the past year			2
the deaths of 24 @entity6 soldiers in november added to anger already felt by @entity6 over the @entity4 raid that killed @entity106 at a compound in @entity6 in may , and continued @entity4 drone strikes on targets in the nation			1
former chairman of the @entity112 , adm. @entity111 , accused @entity6 's intelligence service of protecting the @entity20 , calling it a " veritable arm " of the @entity6 spy agency			0
as a result , he said @entity6 bore some responsibility for the attacks			0
the combined effect was a chilling of @entity6 cooperation with the @entity4 .			0
