-- the @entity2 gamemaker is gearing up to launch @entity3 , a portable game machine with a glasses - free 3 - d display , in the @entity5 on march 27			1
although @entity3 sports a variety of built - in features like a @entity10 camera and augmented - reality minigames , out of the box it lacks some features we would call basic -- a downloadable games store , for example , and the functionality to send messages to your online friends			1
but what @entity3 does have is the ability to automatically receive system updates			1
@entity23 says it will push out firmware updates that will add content and new features to the os without players having to do anything -- they just need to have their 3ds in sleep mode			1
owners of game machines like @entity33 or @entity35 's @entity34 understand why this is a big deal			0
@entity37 has made massive overhauls to the @entity33 's user interface since it shipped the console in 2005 , adding major features like @entity43 movie streaming , @entity45 characters and support for @entity47			2
after five years of updates , today 's @entity33 is practically a whole new machine			0
the same could happen with @entity3			1
@entity23 says some features , like the @entity51 and a web browser , will arrive in a system update in late may			1
to find out what could be next , @entity54 spoke to @entity3 ' producer @entity56 at @entity57 in @entity58 earlier this month			1
as the producer of games like @entity62 and @entity63 , @entity56 's background is in software development			1
@entity23 clearly seems to perceive that continually tweaking and adding to the onboard software for @entity3 is of paramount importance to the handheld 's continuing success			1
here are some things @entity3 probably will do in the future ( and some features you should n't expect			1
) text chat by exchanging 12 - digit numerical codes with fellow early adopters , @entity3 users can build a @entity76			1
right now , there 's not much you can do with it -- you can see which of your friends are online and what game they 're playing , but there 's no way to interact			0
no game invites , no voice chat , not even text messaging			0
when i floated the idea of text chat to @entity56 , he seemed to agree			0
" we are going to be making updates to the system , and i think that 's something that would be really interesting to do , " he said through a translator			0
game demos @entity23 has traditionally been reluctant to release demo versions of games			1
it experimented briefly with them on its @entity102 service , releasing a handful of demos for a limited time			2
by contrast , playable demos are always available for every @entity33 downloadable game and many major retail ones			2
" i question whether or not demos are effective , " said @entity56 , adding that demos on @entity3 would be " technically feasible " but that he is n't sure they motivate players to buy			1
" there are cases where people play a demo game and they 're satisfied with that play experience and they do n't buy the game , " he said			0
" there are also times when they play a demo and think , ' wow , this is great , i 'm going to buy this when i have the chance			0
' so whether or not it 's an effective use of resources , i 'm not sure			2
" @entity0 : @entity3 idea man pulls back curtain on handheld 's capabilities @entity56 said demo versions or even entire games could be automatically pushed to @entity3 with the @entity135 feature			1
" you could wake up in the morning and say , ' oh look , i 've got a new game demo , ' or a new game , " he said			0
games that require @entity10 at last year 's @entity140 , @entity23 showed off a massive array of software demos for @entity3			1
while most of them will be available soon , one of the most interesting ones seems to have been shelved entirely			0
the demo showed a @entity63 - style jumping game with transparent platforms			0
in the system 's 2 - d mode , it was virtually impossible to tell where the overlapping platforms were in relationship to each other			0
with @entity10 on , the depth effect lets you see where to jump			1
" we want to get software out to as many people as possible , and there are some people who just ca n't see @entity10 , " said @entity56 when asked about this demo			2
" we 're moving away from any stance that says if you do n't use the 3 - d functionality you ca n't play this game			2
" limited time offer game industry executives like @entity170 of @entity171 have presented compelling evidence that allowing game developers to temporarily reduce the price of downloadable games can have a dramatic and lasting effect on sales			2
@entity56 says such price flexibility , a la steam or the @entity180 , is n't quite what @entity23 is after			2
" if what you 're coming up with [ is something like ] the @entity185 , where people can freely set their prices , i do n't think that 's going to be the case , " @entity56 said			0
" i 'd be a little sad to see if there was a product that i worked on for a couple of years go on sale for a buck			0
" echoing comments made by his boss , @entity23 president @entity196 , during a @entity57 keynote address , @entity56 said the low prices on @entity200 's store are n't what @entity23 is aiming for on the @entity51			1
" having a business model that allows for the prices to be driven down that low , as a developer it 's kind of scary because we want to protect our content , and the only way we can justify creating good content is if it makes business sense , " he said			0
" it 's more than a pricing issue , it 's a company value			0
we want to compete with ideas , we want to surprise our consumer base			0
