-- three games are on the schedule friday at the @entity3 , including a match between fancied @entity5 and always tough the @entity6 in a rematch of the 2010 final			1
you 'll also be able to watch @entity10 , which at one point was a minute away from missing the finals , battle @entity13 in the first match of the day , and @entity15 take on @entity16 in the last			1
here are five things to look for on friday : crushing on @entity13 their @entity3 history is short and their highlights are limited , with six appearances in the finals and five early exits			2
but since @entity26 's goal to shock holders @entity27 in the 1990 opener , we 've loved watching them			0
they are like a rock band with no hit records , but man do they put on a live show			0
@entity10 says we 're ready now @entity10 was about 90 seconds from being sent home from qualifying , but thanks to a stoppage - time goal from the @entity40 that eliminated @entity41 , @entity10 was able to advance			1
the team also struggled in warmup matches , so you 'd think they might have a goal of say , getting out of their tough group , but no , they plan more			0
" our team is strong and in our minds we believe we can make it all the way to the finals and make history , " longtime defender and captain @entity48 said thursday			2
no sweat , they just have to make it out of a group that also has @entity59 and @entity60			0
early showdown defending champion @entity5 has this winning major titles thing down pat. @entity5 won @entity65 championships in 2008 and 2012 as well as the @entity3 in ' 10			2
that 's why @entity5 is the no. 1 team coming in even if teams like @entity59 and @entity68 are more favored			1
" it 's a veteran team , " @entity70 coach @entity69 said			0
" it 's a mature team with people who are in shape , it 's what they do , what they have done			0
" on friday they meet the @entity6 -- you might call them @entity6 -- in what should be the best game of the day			0
will there be more protests ? in @entity85 , where @entity13 and @entity10 play in the first match of the day , there are 4,700 federal troops to provide security and keep order , the @entity83 reports , adding that a bus strike affecting a half - million commuters began this week			1
reason to love @entity13 one of the best nicknames in the tournament : the @entity13 .			1

@entity13 may not get to the *knockout* round but they usually *delight*
@entity10 was **n't** a great team during qualifying but their captain says do **n't** overlook them
@entity5 coach says his lads are in *physically* good shape
