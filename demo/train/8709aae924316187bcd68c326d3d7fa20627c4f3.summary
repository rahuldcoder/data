-- recent ballistic missile tests by @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 -- which has ominously threatened to " reduce to ashes " the @entity7 military " in minutes " -- are once again focusing the world 's attention on the dangers of nuclear war			1
this concern was dramatically underscored in a new report released at the @entity14 in @entity15			0
titled " nuclear famine : a billion people at risk " ( @entity26 ) , the study shows that even a limited nuclear war , involving less than half of 1 % of the world 's nuclear arsenals , would cause climate disruption that could set off a global famine			1
the study , prepared by @entity28 and its @entity30 affiliate , @entity29 , used a scenario of 100 @entity33 - sized bombs exploded in a war between @entity2 and @entity3			1
if there were such a war , the study estimated that 1 billion people , one - sixth of the human race , could starve over the following decade			2
along with recent events , these findings require a fundamental change in our thinking about nuclear weapons			2
the study , in positing a war between @entity2 and @entity3 , shows the importance of understanding that smaller nuclear powers , not just the @entity30 and @entity51 , pose a threat to the whole world			1
but the greater lesson concerns the forces of the larger nuclear powers			0
each @entity30 @entity58 submarine can destroy 100 cities and produce the global famine described in the study			1
the @entity30 has 14 of them , a fleet of land - based nuclear missiles , and an arsenal of nuclear weapons that can be delivered by bombers			2
the @entity51 possess the same grotesque overkill capacity			0
even the most ambitious arms reductions under discussion would leave the @entity30 and @entity51 with 300 warheads each , most of them 10 to 30 times larger than a @entity33 sized bomb			2
this would be a massive arsenal capable of producing the global famine scenario many , many times over			0
these arsenals are an archaic , but lethal , holdover from the @entity80			1
their continued existence poses an ongoing threat to all humanity			0
steps can and should be taken immediately to lessen this danger			0
substantial numbers of these weapons remain on what the @entity89 has described as " hair - trigger alert			0
" they can be fired in 15 minutes or less and destroy cities a continent away 30 minutes later			0
this alert posture creates the needless danger of an accidental or unintended launch , and the @entity30 and @entity51 have had many close calls , preparing to launch a nuclear strike at the other under the mistaken belief they were under attack			1
the most recent of these near - misses that we know about took place in january 1995 , well after the end of the @entity80			0
the @entity30 and @entity51 should stand down their nuclear arsenals so that it takes longer to launch their missiles , lessening the danger of an accidental war			1
@entity30 president @entity115 and @entity51 president @entity116 can take this step on their own without negotiating a formal treaty			2
beyond this , it is time to begin urgent talks aimed at reducing the @entity30 and @entity51 arsenals as the next essential step toward multilateral negotiations for a @entity127 , a binding , verifiable , enforceable treaty that eliminates nuclear weapons altogether			1
as former @entity133 president @entity132 observed on reviewing the new " @entity135 " study : " i am convinced that nuclear weapons must be abolished			2
their use in a military conflict is unthinkable ; using them to achieve political objectives is immoral			0
" over 25 years ago , president @entity141 and i ended our summit meeting in @entity144 with a joint statement that ' nuclear war can not be won and must never be fought , ' and this new study underscores in stunning and disturbing detail why this is the case			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

writers : @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 missile tests bring up dangers of nuclear war
study shows war using half of 1 % of global nuke arsenals would set off world famine
@entity30 and @entity51 have huge nuclear arsenals , they say , a lethal holdover from @entity80
it 's urgent for talks about reducing arsenals , they write , with a *ban* on weapons the goal
