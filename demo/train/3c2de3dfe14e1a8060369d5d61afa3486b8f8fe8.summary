-- @entity3 has submitted an official request for two of its warships to sail through the @entity8 , an @entity2 official told @entity0 thursday , in a move that puts @entity2 's new military regime in a prickly position with @entity12			1
the @entity14 caretaker government must decide whether to give a green light to the @entity3 warships , believed to be the first that would sail through the @entity18 since the @entity20 's 1979 revolution			1
the @entity2 official told @entity0 that permission will likely be granted			2
but @entity2 might find itself in muddy water over the @entity18			2
the canal is an internal body of water and as such , @entity2 has sovereignty over it			2
but @entity2 also is bound by the 1976 @entity26 , which guaranteed the right of free passage by ships belonging to @entity12 and all other nations on the basis of the @entity32 of 1888			1
before that , @entity2 did not allow @entity12 ships to sail through the canal			1
last week , @entity2 's military government said it would honor all its international treaties			0
now it finds itself in the position of allowing ships belonging to the sworn enemy of its peace treaty partner to sail through			1
" this is awkward -- at a minimum , " said @entity46 , director of the program on @entity48 at the @entity49			0
@entity46 said the @entity3 want a frigate -- the @entity52 -- and a military supply ship -- the @entity54 -- to cross into the @entity55			0
both are armed with missiles , he said			0
their passage would create more uncertainty in the region			0
it raises tension , particularly in this time of transition in @entity2 , " @entity46 said			0
" this is typical of @entity67 - @entity3 opportunism			0
" @entity46 predicted the @entity2 will let the @entity3 through			1
former president @entity68 might have done otherwise , given @entity70 's calls a while back for his ouster			0
but , " there is not a war between @entity3 and @entity2 , " he said			1
get more from @entity74 some maritime analysts privately said @entity76 could pressure @entity2 's new military caretaker government to say no to @entity3			1
@entity76 agreed to a $ 13 billion , 10 - year military aid package to @entity2 in 2007			0
@entity2 's decision , the analysts said , could serve as a barometer for the direction the military caretakers intend to take the @entity48 world 's most populous nation			0
" it does raise an unwelcome political issue that has to be resolved , " said @entity86			0
@entity88 of the @entity89 in @entity90			0
@entity91 , the transit director of the @entity92 , had said earlier thursday that no official request from @entity3 had been received			1
warships planning to cross the canal must ask permission of @entity2 's defense and foreign ministries , @entity94 said			2
the canal authority 's website states that ships intending to sail northbound must be in place by 6 a.m. no @entity3 ships were there thursday , but @entity3 's state - run @entity105 reported the warships were making their way from the @entity109 toward the @entity55			1
@entity3 said earlier that the flotilla was on a yearlong intelligence - gathering and training mission to prepare young cadets to defend @entity3 's cargo ships and oil tankers , according to the semi-official @entity116			2
@entity12 foreign minister @entity117 said the two @entity3 military vessels had been expected to sail wednesday night through the @entity18 on their way to @entity67			1
" this is a provocation that proves that the self - confidence and insolence of the @entity3 is growing from day to day , " he said wednesday			2
" this happens after the @entity3 president 's visit to south @entity127 and his aggressive declarations there towards @entity12			1
" @entity117 did not mention @entity2 by name but said @entity12 's allies should pay close attention to the situation			1
" we expect the international community to act speedily with determination against the @entity3 provocations , designed to deteriorate the situation in the area , and put the @entity3 in their place , " he said			1
the @entity12 @entity140 said @entity12 was monitoring the movement of the @entity3 ships and alerted its allies			1
at the @entity145 , spokesman @entity144 said wednesday the @entity146 is also watching the situation			0
reports of the @entity3 passage also sent jitters through the global market and oil prices spiked for a time on wednesday			0
the @entity8 serves as a key waterway for international trade , allowing ships to navigate between @entity155 and @entity156 without having to go all the way around the vast @entity159 continent			2
millions of barrels of oil move through the @entity18 every day on the way to both @entity155 and @entity163			0
@entity0 's @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 has submitted a request for two ships to sail through the @entity8
