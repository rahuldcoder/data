-- it 's hard for me to choose the greatest @entity4 films of the 21st century as the genres and styles of @entity4 cinema have evolved in a big way over the past 20 years or so			1
movie makers are now showing a more vibrant @entity10 than the @entity12 filmmakers did before them			1
i have chosen films that i loved watching and feel that they are a representative of what is out there in @entity4 cinema -- the rich mix and melting pot that is @entity4 cinema today			1
from a whisper - dir. @entity20 , @entity22 , 2009 this movie is very real and deals with the subject of terrorism -- based on the events surrounding the bomb attacks on the @entity30 embassy in @entity31 in 1998			1
i liked @entity33 's realistic acting and i loved the music			0
@entity20 is a good director who will go on to make greater films			1
the cinematography on this film was exceptional and although for me it had plot issues , i think in the end it all came together			0
read this : @entity42 classics get @entity4 makeover @entity44 ! -- dir. @entity45 , @entity47 , 2010 this is simply a sophisticated gangster movie			1
it has raw energy and puts a human face to all that is happening in the @entity47			0
sometimes just too real , it is gritty , fun and a must - watch thriller			2
sinking sands - dir. @entity55 , @entity57 , 2011 this film deals with domestic violence , but based on the personal journey of a man disfigured in an accident , which makes him turn against his wife			2
@entity64 , who plays the wife , made this film for me and she won @entity67 at the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) for it , but i felt that director @entity55 made the film engage with the audience in an emotional way , showing not just the rawness of domestic violence , but taking us through a range of pain and forgiveness			2
the film also depicts how women can immerse themselves in guilt and force themselves to feel like the guilty party			0
actors @entity81 and @entity64 made this film a must watch and @entity55 chose the right cast to make her directing look beautiful			0
the camera work on this film was excellent -- a bit dark and grainy , but one thing is for sure : you can not watch " @entity89 " and not be affected			0
@entity91 - dir. @entity90 , @entity92 , 2007 " @entity91 " was a very good movie			1
it tells the story of a disadvantaged boy who is discovered as gifted runner			0
i loved the feel , the music and the fact that it was about achieving something from nothing			0
@entity90 , the director and my colleague , is going to shout as i say this , but i believe he is one of the best cinematographers @entity92 has and actor @entity108 was sensational and made this movie for me			2
read more : @entity110 takes on @entity42 @entity111 the great - dir. @entity112 , @entity114 2011 this is one of those films that makes @entity10 great			1
by showcasing the talents of the children who make up its cast , it shows off @entity10 's apparent talent			1
it 's not just the cast that i enjoyed -- it has lovely directing too			0
moolaade - dir. @entity127 , @entity128 , 2004 " moolaade " dealt with a subject that most men would rather not deal with -- female genital mutilation			2
but director @entity133 was not afraid to tackle the subject and the manner of the film was artistic , yet detailed , and did not derail the issues that most people in @entity10 are afraid to confront			1
coming from @entity127 it was important , visual and professionally made -- and it pulls at the viewers ' heart strings			0
@entity144 - dir. @entity143 , @entity10 , 2011 this is one movie i love , just because of the story line of young black @entity10 in the 1980s excelling in surfing -- a sport that was reserved for the whites			1
the sound and picture quality was also excellent , as was the acting			0
" @entity144 " is one of the best @entity4 films i have ever seen and i feel it should have had a lot more accolades than it did			1
read more : ' @entity158 ' brings continent to the small screen @entity162 - dir. @entity161 , @entity163 , @entity47 / @entity164 , 2010 this is a great musical documentary telling the story of @entity167 -- a group of disabled @entity47 musicians			2
the band members start out making a living on the streets of @entity173 , before becoming world - famous musicians			2
@entity176 -- dir. @entity177 , @entity92 , 2007 i love anything to deal with @entity4 myths and mysticism			1
this movie may not have the best sound quality but the storyline was interesting , and it was the first @entity186 film to make it to mainstream film festivals -- including the @entity189 and @entity190 in @entity191 -- after winning an @entity68 ( @entity192 ) in 2007			2
@entity194 - dir. @entity193 , @entity195 , 2011 not strictly an @entity4 movie , but " @entity194 " is one of those films that i just love to watch			1
the music in this film is brilliant , and the cinematography too			0
it deals with the political violence in @entity195 in a realistic way , showing that people born in the ghetto can escape			0
" @entity214 " can be hard to deal with but when you watch the documentary " @entity209 " you begin to understand how politics , music and sports all merge in developing countries			0
for me , this movie is in the same league as " @entity144 , " with its message that you can get out of the corner if you really try			0
story line : excellent , acting : brilliant			0
