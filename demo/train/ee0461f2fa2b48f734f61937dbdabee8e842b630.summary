@entity0 accomplished -- @entity1 booked its place in the last - 16 of the @entity3 after escaping from one of the tournament 's toughest groups			1
@entity8 's men slumped to a 1 - 0 defeat by @entity10 in thursday 's final @entity12 game but still qualified despite @entity13 defeating @entity14 2 - 1			1
@entity16 's second - half strike condemned the @entity17 to defeat following a rain - soaked contest in @entity19			1
but @entity21 's late strike for @entity13 inflicted defeat on @entity14 and ensured the @entity17 qualified in second place on goal difference			1
the @entity17 will now travel to @entity25 where its opponent will be @entity27 on tuesday , while @entity10 will face @entity28 on monday			1
for @entity8 , a man who won the @entity30 as a player with @entity10 and coached the national side to the semifinals in 2006 , this was always going to be an emotional occasion			2
sitting on the @entity17 bench just meters away from his old friend @entity37 , the man who worked as his assistant eight years ago , the game had plots and sub-plots galore			0
" we created too few chances , but it 's still fantastic to go through , " @entity8 said			0
" everybody said we had no chance , but we 've taken it and we 're now in the last 16			0
" any friendship or sentimentality was soon forgotten as the two teams went toe - to - toe in a heavyweight battle			0
played in monsoon - like conditions , both sets of players struggled to find any rhythm in the first half			0
the buildup to the game was disrupted by heavy rain in @entity19 which left fans wading through flooded roads on the way to the stadium			0
traffic was brought to a standstill by floodwaters while family members of the @entity17 team were unable to attend because of the adverse weather conditions			0
@entity10 , which thrashed @entity13 4 - 0 in its opening game before being held 2 - 2 by @entity14 , began in confident fashion and dominated possession			1
but @entity1 , marshaled by the impressive @entity73 , looked more than comfortable as the rain continued to lash down			2
despite being forced to sit back and soak up pressure early on , it was the @entity17 which created the opening chance of the first half when @entity77 sent a curling effort just over the crossbar			0
@entity10 , playing without a recognized striker , enjoyed plenty of possession in front of the @entity17 defense but rarely managed to find a way through			2
and when it did , goalkeeper @entity86 was on hand to ensure @entity90 's effort was blocked , after the @entity92 player momentarily eluded his marker			0
@entity10 changed tactics after the interval with the introduction of veteran striker @entity97 -- the man who stands joint - top in the @entity3 goalscorers ' chart with 15 to his name			1
and it was the 36 - year - old who almost made the breakthrough just minutes after interval but could only plant his header wide after meeting @entity16 's cross			1
as @entity10 continued to push forward , the @entity17 defense began to drop deeper and deeper			2
and with 10 minutes of the second half played , @entity10 finally got the breakthrough it had threatened			2
defender @entity110 sent a thumping header towards goal and while @entity86 managed to beat the ball away , @entity16 fired home the rebound from the edge of the penalty area			1
it was a magnificent strike from @entity16 , an effort which left @entity86 with absolutely no chance as it flew through a clutch of players and into the corner of the net			2
it put the @entity127 joint top scorer at @entity128 2014 alongside home hero @entity129 and @entity131 's @entity130			0
trailing by a single goal , news began to filter through that @entity14 had moved level against @entity13 , with @entity135 canceling out @entity137 's first - half own - goal			1
@entity135 is now @entity138 's all - time leading scorer at the @entity3 with six , having passed @entity140 's @entity139			0
with its future in the tournament hanging by a thread , the @entity17 produced a battling performance with former @entity10 international @entity145 and @entity147 snarling at the heart of the midfield			1
but with 10 minutes remaining , @entity21 's strike in @entity151 left @entity14 with a mountain to climb -- though it was n't enough to prevent an early trip home for @entity156 's world player of the year			1
that did n't prevent the @entity17 piling forward in search of an equalizer though and both @entity160 and captain @entity161 came close to scoring at the death			0
" we were dominant , " said @entity16 , who scored five goals at the @entity164 , where @entity10 lost in the semifinals			1
" all the @entity17 did was sit back deep in their own half , and when that happens , it just becomes a patience game			0
" but sometimes even i manage to have a bright idea -- i spend the whole day training like i 'm obsessed anyway			0

@entity1 qualify for last 16 despite 1 - 0 defeat by @entity10
@entity16 's *fourth* goal of the tournament seals *victory*
@entity13 defeats @entity14 2 - 1 to finish third
@entity10 wins group with @entity1 second on goal difference
