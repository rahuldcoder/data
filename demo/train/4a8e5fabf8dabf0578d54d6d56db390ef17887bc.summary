a defiant @entity0 dives into what could be a defining period of his presidency this week , after repeatedly enraging republicans from afar during his @entity6 tour			1
@entity0 faces showdowns with the @entity4 over immigration , the @entity10 pipeline and his drive for a nuclear deal with @entity13 , all of which have huge consequences for his political legacy			1
far from being chastened by the @entity4 capture of the @entity19 , @entity0 is setting out to prove he is no lame duck and can still set the agenda			1
but the @entity4 insists the mid-terms gave them a share of power in @entity25 , and believe @entity0 risks usurping his authority and even the constitution with his bold new strategy			1
@entity0 drawing lines on immigration , climate change @entity0 chose a highly symbolic setting to set the tone for two final @entity34 years in which he will face a unified @entity4 @entity36			1
side - by - side in @entity38 with the world 's most famous dissident , @entity0 refused to bow to what @entity4 regard as the capital 's new political " reality			1
" on the veranda of the lakeside villa from where @entity46 faced down a junta , @entity0 said he had long warned @entity48 he would use executive power to reform the @entity51 immigration system if they failed to			1
" that 's gon na happen			0
that 's gon na happen before the end of the year			0
" the president doubled down in @entity56 on sunday , before boarding @entity57 for home , saying he would be derelict in his duties if he did not act			0
" i ca n't wait in perpetuity when i have authorities that at least for the next two years can improve the system , " he said			0
@entity34 officials have not said when @entity0 will wield his executive powers in a move that could remove the threat of deportation for millions of undocumented people			1
but they say it will be soon			0
while @entity0 was abroad , post-election tensions escalated sharply on @entity71 as happy talk from both sides about working together quickly ebbed away			2
senior aides dispute the idea the elections were a referendum on the president and say @entity0 is at his best when he is on " offense " and believe that 's what @entity51 want to see			2
so , as he trekked through @entity6 , @entity0 rattled @entity4 almost every day			1
related : on the other side of the world , @entity0 determined as ever to bypass @entity36 he surprised everyone with a new climate deal with @entity86 that the @entity4 slammed as costly and " ridiculous			1
" he popped up on video to discuss new @entity89 regulations that may spark another row			0
he refused to budge on approving the @entity10 pipeline to take oil from @entity93 to the @entity94			0
he may veto a bill on the project that @entity36 is expected to pass this week			0
while in @entity6 , the president debunked the idea that the plan , opposed by environmentalists in his political base , would create lots of jobs and lower gas prices			0
@entity0 says he still wants to work with republicans on tax reform and infrastructure spending bills			2
but it looks like he has decided that he wo n't compromise his legacy priorities to get that done			0
@entity4 promises retribution , but avoids specifics @entity4 are fuming over @entity0 's go - it - alone attitude since voters handed the @entity4 the @entity19 and expanded its majority in the @entity34			1
" we 'd like for the president to recognize the reality that he has the government that he has , not the one he wishes he had , " said the next @entity117 senate majority leader @entity117			0
@entity121 sen. @entity121 warned @entity0 could spark a backlash over immigration			1
" if he goes it alone he is going to run into the ire of the @entity51 people , " @entity121 said , though said @entity36 also had a responsibility to act			0
@entity4 @entity19 leadership member @entity128 warned however that @entity0 will eventually have to play ball , or he will end up with @entity4 bills he does n't like			1
" at that point , his choice is to sign it or veto it			0
" @entity4 leader @entity135 said his goal was to stop the president from violating his oath of office and the constitution			2
" there are things he is just not going to get			0
" @entity4 anger is however masking a serious problem the party has yet to resolve : how to hit back at what it sees a presidential power grab			2
other than warning that @entity0 would " poison the well " for future cooperation , @entity4 leaders wo n't say whether they will use pending federal funding bills as leverage			1
that route led to a damaging government shutdown for which the @entity4 paid a heavy political price last year			2
one response could be to pass a series of short term funding measures , that keep administration priorities in limbo and maximize @entity4 leverage			2
@entity34 @entity4 could also chose to expand the lawsuit they have already lodged against @entity0 alleging he usurped his authority in implementing @entity165			1
conservative columnist @entity166 stirred buzz on friday by declaring executive action on immigration would even be an " impeachable " offense			1
@entity4 leaders are already braced for pressure from the right for a tangible and not merely symbolic reflex when the president acts			2
" if the president moves forward and does his executive action , the @entity48 have no choice but to respond , " said @entity175 , communications director of @entity176 , a conservative non profit group			1
" that response needs to be legislative			0
the vehicle that makes most sense is denying funding for the activity that they say is unconstitutional and inappropriate			0
" obamacare : voters , are you stupid ? @entity0 's strategy could divide republicans @entity175 's point reflects a secondary benefit some democrats see in @entity0 's strategy â € ” it will cause a big political headache for @entity4 bosses			1
@entity0 's immigration move is certain to ignite a firestorm of grass roots conservative anger			2
that will in turn pile pressure on rank - and - file @entity4 @entity34 members who campaigned for office slamming what they see as an imperial president			1
some conservative lawmakers were already skittish at leadership warnings that it might be impossible to repeal @entity185 with a @entity209 president in the @entity34			2
nothing worries republicans in deeply conservative districts more than the prospect of a primary challenge , and many simply can not afford not to mount the kind of rowdy response to @entity0 which will rock @entity135 's restive caucus			2
several @entity34 @entity4 are arguing that it 's time to quickly get to work on holding hearings and drafting an immigration bill to demonstrate their party has its own reform ideas , and is not just about blocking the president 's policies			1
" ultimately we all know we 've got to deal with this problem , so why not start dealing with the problem - even though it 's the lame duck , even though you 're not going to get anything through to final passage , " @entity229 @entity4 rep @entity227 told reporters friday			0
" now we could start showing some seriousness that we 're going to address this problem			0
" executive orders on immigration will also detonate as the 2016 presidential race dawns , trapping @entity4 between the party 's activist base and a desire to engage @entity245 voters vital to @entity4 @entity34 hopes			1
@entity4 are also adamantly opposed to the nuclear deal with @entity13 which could emerge from down - to - the - wire talks in @entity248 starting this week and are threatening to upend it with new sanctions			0
@entity0 appears to reject the idea @entity4 have a mandate for change at all			1
he stressed in his post-election news conference that two thirds of @entity51 did not even vote and he was " the guy who 's elected by everybody			0
" but he knows a tough political fight looms and reflected friday on the contrast between polarization at home and the welcome he gets on his travels			0
" you are always popular in somebody else 's country			0
when you 're in your own country , everybody is complaining			0
