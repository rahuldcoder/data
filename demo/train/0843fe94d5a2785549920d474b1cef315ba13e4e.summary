-- the hijacked jet planes that roared out of a clear blue sky one sunny september morning 10 years ago killed nearly 3,000 people , but the hurt they did spread far beyond the immediate death and destruction at the @entity7 and the @entity8			1
the damage was mental , psychological , even spiritual			0
and the death of @entity11 at the hands of @entity14 special operations forces may help to start some healing , said @entity17 and @entity18 religious leaders , relatives of victims , and a generation who grew in the shadow of 9/11			1
mixed emotions about @entity11 's death : how should we feel ? " there is a sense that justice has been done , " said @entity27 , senior pastor of the 12,000 - member @entity29 in @entity31 , @entity32 , and a spiritual adviser to president @entity34			1
" there is a scripture , @entity39 , that says , ' he who sheds man 's blood , by man his blood be shed			2
' there is a certain kind of sense of relief that that has been accomplished , " @entity27 said			0
" this man was symbolic of much that threatened our country and our way of life , " the pastor said			1
@entity27 also cited the verse promising that " those who mourn will be comforted , " saying they might " find some sort of solace in this event			0
" @entity14 take to the streets amid news of @entity11 's death those verses are much more relevant than @entity66 ' admonition to " turn the other cheek , " he said			1
victim 's dad : why i 'm not celebrating @entity11 's death " that particular scripture has to do with insult and not with self - defense , " he said			1
the terror attacks that @entity11 authorized are " not even in the category of forgiveness , " so killing him " really is in a category that , for 99.9 % of @entity14 , would be beyond question ... the right thing			1
" morally ok to cheer ? @entity80 , whose husband died in the @entity7 , certainly has no questions about it			0
@entity84 , 38 , was working for @entity85 on the 101st floor of the @entity87 on september 11 , 2001 , when a jet plane slammed into the floors beneath him			0
his body was never found			0
his son was 6 years old at the time			0
his widow has been grieving ever since			2
but early monday , at ground zero where the towers once stood , she said she was finally experiencing some catharsis			0
" i 'm missing him , but i feel that justice has been done , " she said , holding a picture of @entity84			2

i never thought it would happen ... never thought it would give me a feeling of closure , " she said			2
now , she added , " i feel better ... like i can start a new chapter in my life			1
" we celebrated ' the death of my generation 's face of terror ' relatives of the victims are not the only @entity14 feeling relief monday morning -- @entity14 @entity117 also hope the death of @entity11 will open a new chapter in history			1
the 2001 attacks opened a " wound has never quite healed , " said @entity122 , formerly of the controversial @entity18 community center planned for lower @entity124 , not far from the former site of the twin towers			0
" the killing of @entity11 is a major milestone , " he said			1
" it expresses the sense that there is a sense of healing beginning to take place			0
" far from @entity138 , @entity137 lawyer @entity136 agrees that @entity11 wounded the country 's @entity117 , but is not sure his death with heal anything			1
" the 9/11 attacks changed my life forever in a very challenging way , " said @entity142 , who lives in @entity143 , @entity144			2
" it 's 10 years later and people still question us " @entity151			2
" we have all had to become ambassadors for our religion , we have had to condemn every terrorist attack or be labeled a supporter of terrorism , " she said			0
" none of us can be a quiet person that just goes to our jobs , we have all had to become multifaith activists who reach out , " said @entity142 , the author of " @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity18			0

@entity166 , whose older brother , @entity167 , worked in the @entity7 , said he was " very elated " at the news @entity11 was dead			1
" we have been waiting for this for a long time , " he said			0
" i felt that it was just a great moment for the country			0
" he said the scenes of jubilation across the @entity14 should not be seen as people celebrating somebody 's death , but as a recognition that " everyone feels that capturing @entity11 or killing @entity11 was something that needed to be done			1
" @entity166 had another brother who also worked in the @entity7 but left to go to the bank just before the first plane hit			0
" he said as soon as he saw it , he knew " @entity167 was dead , @entity166 said			0
unlike some others in the towers , @entity184 did not call to say goodbye , @entity166 said			0
" we never heard from him , " he said			0
hunting down @entity11 at last " shows the strength of @entity14 , shows we 're not going to put up with it , " he said , adding it would " make the terrorists think twice			1
" @entity166 was " a little surprised " bin @entity11 was buried at sea immediately after his death , he said , fearing it would fuel conspiracy theories			1
but in the final analysis , he said , " the world can feel a little bit safer right now			2
" another 9/11 widow , @entity202 , said the death of @entity11 would change the world			1
" my 12 - year - old daughter will wake tomorrow to a safer world , hopefully a more peaceful world			0
and that brings me a rare sense of relief , " she said in a statement , adding that she was " enormously grateful for the tireless effort and incredible courage and bravery of our counter-terrorism agents			0
