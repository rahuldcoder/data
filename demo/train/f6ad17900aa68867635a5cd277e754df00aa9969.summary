@entity1 @entity0 recognize they have a problem with women			1
" some of our members just are n't as sensitive as they ought to be			0
" house speaker @entity5 said bluntly when asked about recent efforts by the @entity1 @entity8 campaign arm to improve how male candidates appeal to female voters			1
@entity5 did n't name names , but much of the damage with female voters is self - inflicted , and stems from some high - profile gaffes from @entity8 @entity16 candidates in 2012			1
@entity16 candidate @entity17 referred to " legitimate rape " and @entity19 in @entity20 suggested rape was " something @entity23 intended to happen			0
" both red - state candidates were favored to win but lost badly			2
in the presidential race , the already noticeable gender gap between women supporting @entity28 candidates over @entity0 widened ; women preferred president @entity31 over challenger @entity32 by 11 percentage points			1
mindful of the damage done , the @entity34 is teaching male candidates who are running against female challengers or incumbents how to respond to specific questions about rape			2
the effort is part of the @entity34 's overall media training it conducts each cycle			0
a senior @entity1 @entity0 strategist familiar with the training told @entity48 this is just one aspect of helping candidates effectively talk to voters			1
but after the @entity17 and @entity19 missteps , this @entity0 said @entity8 candidates must be prepared to answer questions about sensitive subjects like rape			1
" @entity64 and foremost what we tell them to do ( is ) talk about yourself as a husband and a father , " this source told @entity48 , adding , " after that we urge a blanket statement about rape is abhorrent : ' anyone who is charged with this offense should be fully prosecuted , and as a husband and father i am outraged			0
' " @entity5 also pointed to the obvious issue facing his party : there are a lot more female @entity28 @entity1 members than @entity0			1
only 19 of the 232 house @entity8 members are women			1
earlier this year the @entity1 @entity8 campaign arm launched @entity77 to recruit more female candidates and improve how the party frames issues to female voters			1
the @entity8 strategist familiar with the effort said it 's not just about avoiding mistakes and improving messaging -- the party also is playing offense			2
@entity0 believe @entity88 gives them the chance to win over women by talking about the premiums their families will pay or the so - called " marriage penalty " they believe will hit many people 's pocketbooks			1
the party also encourages @entity8 members to humanize themselves and stress the impact that fiscal issues have on their own families			0
in an interview with @entity48 's @entity103 on thursday , @entity1 majority leader @entity101 tried to link the @entity8 's focus on reining in the deficit to his daughter , who is in college			1
" she 's off now thinking about her next step in life , what kind of career or job opportunities are available for her , " he said			0
" well , i do n't believe that racking up trillions of dollars of additional deficit and debt are a good thing for her because , ultimately , what that does is it mortgages her future			0
" the @entity34 effort is more than messaging -- the party is urging candidates to create and sustain efforts to reach out to women , regardless of whether or not they are facing female challengers			2
strategists are suggesting building coalitions of female supporters and regularly attending events such as @entity136 meetings			0
as for the advice he would give to his colleagues who are facing off against female candidates next fall , @entity5 said , " well , i 'm trying to get them to be a little bit more sensitive			1
" @entity144 @entity143 , who frequently touts the diversity of the @entity28 caucus , quipped that @entity0 have " made an art of running against women in ways that we think are inappropriate			1
" but she added , " it would be interesting to see what they have in their curriculum			0
" @entity156 @entity155 rep. @entity155 , a close ally of @entity5 , is in a competitive race with democrat @entity158 , a former state senator			2
he does n't think there are major differences on which issues men and women care about , but said it 's a matter of emphasis			0
" i think there are maybe some priority differences in issues that women are very concerned about -- available time , they are very concerned about budgets , because they run the place			0
the cost and access to health care is a big issue to them , " @entity155 said			0
but when asked if he thinks there 's any continued fallout for @entity8 members a year after @entity17 's comments , @entity155 paused deliberately and then said , " it 's extremely unfortunate what some people will say that may reflect badly on other people who do n't share those views			2
" @entity8 rep. @entity187 said she 's given her @entity0 male colleagues " gentle guidance " for some time on the need to address issues that are important to women and to show how their legislative agenda will make their lives easier			1
although she says the effort is overdue , @entity197 is heartened that her party is dealing with the issue head - on now			0
" there is an aggressiveness that has not been in there forever , " she told @entity48			0
" we 've never been this aggressive and i 'm glad and i think it 's time			2
we all should be a bit more aware in how we choose our words			0
