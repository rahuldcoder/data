-- when the job offer came from the @entity3 in the winter of 2005 , @entity1 jumped at the chance			1
it was her " dream job , " she says , and she picked up her family and moved from @entity8 to @entity9			0
two years later , she left in frustration , unable , she says , to do the job she was hired to do : help clean up compounding pharmacies			2
compound pharmacists create customized medication solutions for patients for whom manufactured pharmaceuticals wo n't work , according to the @entity17			0
those mixed - batch drugs can range from children 's cough syrup -- like adding grape flavor -- to complex concoctions that treat cancer , according to @entity24 , an associate professor of health law and bioethics at @entity27			0
as a young pharmacist , @entity1 had worked in a compounding pharmacy and was shocked by what she describes as unsterile conditions			1
" the pharmacy was purportedly making sterile injections from scratch using non-sterile ingredients , " she told a @entity33 committee in 2003			0
" when i asked permission to order and substitute @entity3 - approved products because of safety concerns , i was cautioned that it would be less profitable for the pharmacy			1
" at the @entity3 , @entity1 had hoped to help write new federal sterility guidelines for compounding pharmacies			1
" i expected the guidelines to come out when i was working at the agency in 2006 , " @entity1 said			1
" but it never happened			0
" more than six years later , those guidelines -- which some experts say might have prevented the current outbreak of meningitis -- still have not come out			2
twelve people have died in the current outbreak of non-contagious fungal meningitis , linked to contaminated steroid injections made by the @entity58 - based @entity57			2
meningitis outbreak highlights failed oversight efforts " we 've been waiting for years for these guidelines , " said @entity61 , a pharmacist and president of the @entity63			2
" they 're desperately needed to assure patient safety			0
" over the years , people have died , been blinded and become ill from contaminated medicines made at compounding pharmacies			1
in 2003 , the @entity71 testified that the @entity3 was aware of more than 200 adverse events associated with drugs from compounding pharmacies since 1990			1
the infections continued : for example , in 2011 , nine people in @entity76 died from blood infections after they received intravenous medicine made at a compounding pharmacy , and in 2011 and 2012 , 33 people suffered fungal eye infections from drops made at a compounding pharmacy in @entity85			1
the sterility guidelines are in " in progress , " according to @entity88 , an @entity3 spokeswoman			1
the agency , she said , has tried for 20 years to have more oversight of compounding pharmacies but has faced challenges by the industry			2
when asked why it 's taking years to write these guidelines , @entity95 declined to comment			2
@entity1 said that when she worked at the @entity3 , " political pressure " kept the guidelines from being published			1
" compounding pharmacies make a lot of money , and it goes to various places at the state and federal level , " she said			0
the @entity17 of @entity106 has spent more than $ 1 million over the past decade on lobbying , according to the @entity108			0
@entity109 , the group 's executive vice president and chief executive officer , denies that his group has lobbied against federal sterility standards and says it has actually been fighting for them			1
" we 've written to the @entity3 ; we 've written to @entity116 , " @entity109 said			0
" we 've been pushing on this since before 2003			0
" after @entity1 left the @entity3 , she moved back to @entity8 and became an independent consultant , and she still fights for better standards for compounding pharmacies			1
the problem , she says , is bigger than just a few outbreaks , since illnesses might not be traced back to contaminated drugs			0
" the @entity3 only knows about the safety concerns they hear about , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity127 contributed to this report .			0
