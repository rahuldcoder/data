-- @entity1 drew a standing ovation when she initiated an impromptu pageant during the outstanding lead actress in a comedy category at the 2011 @entity6			1
at the 2012 @entity8 , @entity7 made viewers do a double take , photo - bombing poehler as the nominees were announced for best actress in a tv comedy or musical			1
the " @entity18 " and " @entity20 " stars have been stealing the spotlight at awards shows as presenters and nominees for years			0
as @entity26 of @entity27 says , " it 's almost like they 've been practicing for this			0
" " this " being their gig co-hosting the 70th @entity8 , to air on @entity31 on january 13			1
the news , which broke monday evening , was met with such excitement from fans , celebrities and the media that many were left wondering , " @entity39 - who ? " it was announced this month that " @entity43 " creator @entity42 would host the 85th @entity44			1
it 's still considered a great get for the @entity44 , which have been fixated on attracting a younger demographic , but all anybody seems to care about is the @entity48			1
@entity49 , an author , tv historian and former network executive , told @entity52 of @entity42 's appeal , " younger viewers probably know the name , but he 's not an a star			0
" it should be noted , however , that @entity42 's " @entity60 " recently broke a box office record : the flick about a teddy bear that comes to life has surpassed " @entity65 " as the highest - grossing non-sequel r - rated comedy worldwide			0
meanwhile , @entity49 said of the @entity8 pick , " @entity7 is a good choice , particularly			1
she 's appealing to younger and older viewers			0
she 's not too trendy but trendy enough			0
" poehler has similar range			0
before starring on " @entity18 , " she appeared alongside @entity7 on " @entity71 " and in " @entity69 " and " @entity70 , " in addition to films like " @entity74 " and " @entity75			2
" " they 're the first people we approached " for the job , said @entity76 , president of the @entity77			1
" i like their style of comedy because they 're not trying to be funny , but they 're funny			2
" @entity76 is just one of many dedicated fans			0
two women recently bid big bucks at @entity91 's " @entity90 , " which benefits autism programs , to hang out with @entity7 and @entity1 for one night			1
as some media outlets have pointed out , perhaps just to stir the pot , the foreign press association 's decision to book @entity7 and @entity1 could be seen as a slap in the face of the @entity44 for choosing to announce @entity44 nominations on january 10 , before the @entity8			1
however , @entity76 - @entity76 says , that 's not the case			0
" i have the deep belief that we honor the members of the @entity44 , " she said			2
" in other words , what are the @entity8 about ? what are we honoring ? everyone we 're honoring there is a member of the @entity44 , right ? where 's the competition ? " the @entity114 pick was made because " they 're obviously very pleasant to look at , and ... they play off of each other beautifully , " @entity76 added , noting that she enjoyed their skit at the 2011 @entity6			1
even @entity120 , who hosted the @entity8 in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 , had kind words for the ladies : " good luck to @entity7 and @entity1 at the @entity8			1
after failing three years in a row to make @entity125 channel 's @entity128 list , i decided to hand over the reins			0
" this is the pair that viewers have been waiting to see , @entity27 's @entity131 said			0
it 's not that people are expecting these women to get on stage and reinvent awards shows ; it 's that they 're looking forward to hearing smart jokes			2
" they wo n't sit there and insult people like @entity120 did , " @entity131 said			2
" it 's like in ' @entity20 , ' when you watch it , people at home feel like they 're in on the joke			2
... they 'll pull the audience in that way			0
" like " @entity71 's " @entity152 tweeted , " poehler and @entity7 hosting the @entity8 is excellent news for those who love good times			1

@entity7 and @entity1 will co-host the 70th @entity8
