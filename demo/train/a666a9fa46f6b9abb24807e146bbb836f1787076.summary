-- popular apps for the @entity2 and @entity3 , some of which usually go for up to $ 20 , were being offered for free in @entity7 's online @entity6 on monday , possibly in conjunction with the store 's fifth anniversary			1
popular games were in abundance on the list , with " @entity14 , " " where 's my water ? " and " @entity17 " among them			1
the steepest discount appeared to be @entity20 , a suite of tools for mixing and recording music that usually goes for $ 19.99			1
@entity25 + , photo - text app @entity26 and recipe app how to @entity24 also were among the apps being offered for free monday			1
@entity7 did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the free apps			1
in may , the @entity6 passed a staggering 50 billion downloads , according to @entity7			2
it seems likely that the apparent promotion will be part of an effort to commemorate july 10 , 2008 , the day the @entity6 went live as an update to @entity39			2
it increased the appeal of the @entity2 , and later the @entity3 , and created a sales model that has been adopted by rivals like @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 in the years since			1
that 's led to @entity7 to trademark the term " app store " in an ongoing effort to protect the term			2
in 2011 , @entity7 filed a lawsuit against @entity54 , which rolled out the @entity55 along with its entry into the tablet market with the @entity58			0
last month , the two companies failed to come to an agreement after new rounds of negotiations			0
@entity7 argues that @entity54 infringes on its trademark by calling its store that sells apps an " app store			0
" @entity54 argues that the words constitute a generic description			0
the term " app , " as applied to computers , dates at least to the 1980s			0
@entity44 's app store , for users of its mobile android operating system , is called @entity75			0
@entity46 has @entity76 , and @entity45 's merely says " @entity77 " at the top of its mobile store 's homepage .			0
