@entity0 -- @entity2 and his partner , @entity3 , were ready to adopt a child			1
they moved through all their requirements smoothly , even completing an orientation and training course for prospective parents			1
then they were confronted with their first real stumbling block			2
" our adoption agent said , ' well , you both look the same on paper , so who 's going to be the parent ? ' " @entity2 recalls			1
in @entity19 , where the couple lived at the time , only individuals and legally married couples may adopt from the @entity24 foster care system			1
but because a same - sex couple can not legally marry in the state , only one parent can be granted legal rights to the child			1
" we saw ( it ) as a disadvantage to the child , " said @entity2 , 47			1
" we , frankly , got very angry about it when we thought about everybody else that was in the ( training ) class			2
none of them were asked this question			2
and it came down to the fact that we were a male couple			0
this was when we first experienced how being that gay couple just adds to the complexity of the whole process			1
it makes it much harder			0
" in 18 states and the @entity52 , same - sex couples can jointly petition to adopt a child			1
but in the other states , such as @entity19 , the law either restricts joint adoption or is unclear			1
that only adds confusion and frustration to what is already a " mind - numbing " adoption process , @entity2 said			1
" it makes your head spin with the questions that are asked of you , with the forms that you have to fill out , " he said			0
" and then you have on top of that the fact that your family might not be that mom - and - dad home			1
you 're that gay or lesbian family ... and the questions begin to change			1
" @entity2 and his partner did their homework and were eventually able to adopt two sibling boys after relocating to @entity0 for @entity3 's new job			1
but it was a long , arduous and invasive process , one that scares off many other potential parents , @entity2 said			2
" it becomes a daunting experience , " he said			0
" it 's why the families do n't always come forward , because they think they 're going to be rejected			0
" and to him , that is unacceptable with 107,000 boys and girls waiting for adoption in the @entity24			1
" when you lose that family , you lose an opportunity for a child , " he said			2
... that child sitting in foster care year after year after year is not going to their social worker and saying , ' i only want a mom - and - dad home			1
' " determined to help other families deal with the same obstacles that he had faced , @entity2 started a nonprofit , @entity106			1
it began as a simple online resource for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people wanting to foster or adopt. but as word spread about its growing expertise and its success in helping foster placements and adoptions , more diverse people started coming to the group for help			1
" it does n't matter if you 're gay , straight , pink , purple , orange , polka - dotted , from @entity125 , from the moon or any other place , " @entity2 said			1
" if you think you can make a difference with these kids , you should be stepping forward to do this			0
... " it 's unacceptable that families are faced with barriers that are put in their way because of a myth , a misunderstanding , miscommunication ... preventing a child from having a family just because ( other people ) just do n't like what that family looks like			2
" @entity2 estimates that his group has helped thousands of families -- both gay and straight -- by offering a range of services such as lawyer referrals , case consultations , special - needs classes and tips on therapists and pediatricians			1
with the help of a nationwide network of volunteers -- many of whom have benefited from the group in the past -- everything is free			0
" families contact us and say , ' i want to do this , how do i do this ? ' we do two things : find out the answer and figure out how it really works for their specific situation , because they are never the same , " @entity2 said			0
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2012 @entity172 according to the state of @entity176 , more than 75 % of families who have attended a training class through @entity2 's group have gone on to be placed with a foster child			1
" that is much higher than other agencies , " said @entity180 , adoption and permanency supervisor for the state 's @entity183			2
@entity2 has also become a preferred trainer of the state , training nearly 250 families a year since 2002			0
" he has a unique perspective , and families connect to this , " @entity180 said			0
" and ( @entity2 's work ) is done for truly altruistic reasons			0
there is no cost to the state for it			0
we have others that support us and do a lot of work , but we tend to pay for that service			0
@entity106 does it through donations and grants , and he has n't been paid in years			0
" @entity211 , a single , gay man , called @entity106 when he encountered difficulty finalizing the adoption of his now 13 - year - old son , @entity214			1
" i am 100 % sure that if it were n't for @entity2 , i would not have my son , " @entity211 said			0
" he understands how things should go , but also when they do n't go right , how can we get them back on track ? he figured out how to get us over that finish line			0
" in 2007 , the @entity223 of the @entity223 estimates that there were 65,500 adopted children living with a gay parent in the @entity24			1
@entity2 says these homes are really not all that different from traditional mom - and - dad households			2
" we 're a two - dad home , " he said			2
" on the surface , does it look different ? sure			0
but when we 're at home , does it look any different than anybody else ? no. we argue and fight with the kids to get their homework done and brush their teeth and take a shower and brush their hair			0
' put your shoes on the right feet ! ' ' is your backpack packed ? ' ' why is your lunch sitting on the floor when the dog is eating it ? ' well , that 's the same thing everybody else complains about			0
" @entity2 has had his two boys , @entity249 and @entity250 , since 2002 , and he ca n't imagine sitting idle while there are so many other foster children who are still stuck in the system			2
" thinking of all of the other @entity249 and @entity255 that are in foster care , and not knowing what 's going to happen to them ... i ca n't just walk away from that			0
... " it 's not my job to go in and guarantee what the life of that child 's going to be			2
it 's simply my job to make sure that child has some sort of hope			2
... we 're going to make this match , and we 're going to move forward			0
and that kid 's going to have as productive a life as we can help that kid have			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity106 website at @entity276 and see how to help .			0

@entity278 started a nonprofit to help other gay @entity24 become parents
in many states , same - sex couples can not jointly adopt a child
more than *100,000* boys and girls are waiting for adoption in the @entity24
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2012 @entity172
