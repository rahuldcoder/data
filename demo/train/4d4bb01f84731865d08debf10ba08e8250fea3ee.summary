-- living at the @entity4 - @entity3 border , i had the unique opportunity to train under two @entity3 tae kwon do masters			1
while i told people i was there to learn the rare @entity3 martial art from some of their best instructors , i was secretly helping @entity3 refugees on the 6,000 - mile modern - day underground railroad from the @entity16 to @entity17 , for food and a better life			1
in 2004 , i traveled to @entity3 to see the country , even though many people warned me not to take the risk			2
one of our detained @entity4 workers later said that @entity3 had a file on me , but did not know my name			1
i lived with the fear of being detained , abducted or assassinated by the @entity3 government for many years			1
whenever i hear of another @entity30 detained , it reminds me of that anxiety			2
on monday , three @entity30 citizens , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , all held captive in @entity3 , were interviewed by @entity0 in a @entity38 hotel room			1
this rare and surprise interview was an apparent move by the regime to get a high - ranking @entity30 official to visit the country			1
@entity3 has been collecting @entity30 citizens and planning for this very moment			1
what the @entity3 government wants out of its latest stunt is simple : internal control and external respect			2
but this flawed strategy will hardly achieve its desired intent			0
@entity3 regime leaders use these incidents to buy currency with their people , and these days , they can use all they can get			2
they want to send a message to @entity3 that says , " look at how powerful we are			1
" how @entity3 may be using @entity30 detainees as ' bargaining chips ' after i watched the interviews with the three @entity30 , it was clear that it was a coordinated message to ask for a high - level @entity30 envoy to be sent			1
it was no coincidence that all three requested this			0
@entity68 , former @entity30 ambassador to the @entity69 , told @entity70 , " the @entity3 are sending signals to the @entity30 that they are ready to deal			1
" many @entity3 refugees we sheltered in @entity4 told us how brutal the regime can be			1
this was confirmed by this year 's @entity69 report on the many human rights violations that @entity3 has knowingly committed			0
brutal interrogations , food deprivation and torture are all part of the @entity3 playbook			0
but @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 all said they are being treated humanely and are even provided with medical care			0
@entity3 is walking a fine line here			1
it wants to use the three @entity30 as bait but not anger the @entity30 so much that a high - ranking envoy will not come to the negotiating table			1
it seems the three men are being treated well , although it is hard to say definitively			0
@entity3 has played this game before			0
president @entity92 paid a visit to secure the release of journalists @entity95 and @entity97 in 2009 , and president @entity98 visited in 2010 for the release of @entity100			0
@entity3 used both cases as propaganda ploys			0
but what the regime does not realize is that it is preaching to a disappearing choir			0
@entity3 has enjoyed near complete control of the media its people consume in the past , but this is rapidly changing			2
foreign dvds are being smuggled in			0
people are hacking their radios to receive signals from the outside world			0
phones connected to @entity4 cell towers are being used along the border to relay messages in and out of the country			2
what the regime does not take into account is that , however it spins a visit by a high - level @entity30 dignitary , there are diminishing returns to this familiar cycle			1
meanwhile , the outside world it so wishes to impress by its ability to attract such luminaries is tiring of those games			2
at home , it is losing both			0
in the world , it has neither .			0

@entity138 helped @entity3 *escape* at @entity4 border , lived with fear of being kidnapped
he says interview with @entity30 citizens was move to get high - ranking @entity30 official to visit
@entity138 : @entity147 wants to impress its people with message " look at how powerful we are "
@entity138 : @entity3 walking a fine line : the world is sick of its games , its people wising up
