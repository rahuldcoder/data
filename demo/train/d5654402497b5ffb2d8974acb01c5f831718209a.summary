@entity0 -- during the 1970s , @entity2 really was car crash telly			1
drivers were routinely maimed or killed as safety took a back seat			1
the wacky races run during that era provided the sport with some of its most celebrated and reviled moments which are now the subject of two feature - length films released this autumn			1
' @entity15 ' directed by @entity17 - winning director @entity16 , " @entity15 " tells the true story of the battle between @entity20 and @entity22 's @entity21 for the 1976 @entity2			1
the pair were polar opposites			0
@entity20 , played by @entity26 actor @entity25 , was a swashbuckling , hedonistic @entity28			1
@entity21 ( @entity30 ) , on the other hand , was a deeply fastidious character known as " the @entity32			2
" a glorious battle of egos ensues amid a season marked by arguments over car and fuel regulations off the track and near - tragedy on it when @entity21 spectacularly crashes out of the @entity42 @entity2 at the nurburgring			1
trapped inside the burning wreck of his @entity45 , @entity21 is eventually pulled free by fellow drivers but not before enduring terrible burns to his face and lung damage			1
not only does @entity21 beat the odds -- at one point a priest is called to administer the last rites -- he also defies all logic , returning to race 43 days later at @entity55 where he finishes fourth in the @entity57 @entity2			1
" i was happy to stay alive			0
normally you get killed in this kind of accident , " @entity21 told @entity1 at the world premiere in @entity0 earlier this month			1
" it was clear that the challenge now was to say : can you ever come back , and how much time does it take ? this was really my challenge			0
it was not @entity20 at the time			2
so i fought my way back five weeks later in @entity55			0
" @entity21 's miraculous return makes for a thrilling climax to the season which , naturally , ends on a controversial note at a rain - lashed @entity76 in @entity77			1
" both of these guys were so truthful and so competitive and there 's not a hypocritical bone in either of their bodies , " director , @entity16 told @entity1			0
" they just did things their way			0
they would have scars of some of those decisions , but they also got to own their own triumphs and you have to admire that			0
to me , that 's the nobility of the story			2
" " @entity15 " goes on release in the @entity97 on september 20			1
' 1 ' serious injuries and fatalities are thankfully rare in @entity2 these days , but it was n't so long ago that the sport would consider itself very lucky to get through a season without someone being killed			1
" 1 , " a new 90 - minute documentary narrated by @entity105 , tells the story of the fight to improve safety told by the men who survived the sport 's most deadly era			1
" the racetracks had n't changed , the medical facilities had n't changed and suddenly the cars were going almost twice as fast , " explains three - time world champion @entity112 during the film			2
director @entity117 , vividly recalls his teenage self watching @entity2 during the 1970s in an almost permanent state of disbelief			1
" the thing i always remember about it was thinking : another one has died			0
i could n't quite fathom ( it )			0
" @entity117 speaks to the survivors -- @entity112 , @entity127 , @entity128 and others -- who share stories of camaraderie and their battles with the sport 's governing body , the @entity133 , to take safety more seriously			2
" all the drivers were trying , but the biggest key was the @entity133			2
basically their attitude was : ' if you think it 's dangerous , slow down , ' " @entity117 says			0
" i think they thought we were gladiators , " @entity112 says			0
" they were blind to the reality			0
they did n't know those drivers			2
they did n't know the driver 's wives , fathers and mothers			0
" improvements eventually came , but it was n't until the death of @entity154 at @entity155 in 1994 that safety regulations started to be transformed , says @entity117			2
" that was the point at which they had the technology and the will , and they had @entity162 running the @entity133			0
" today , whatever the sport may have lost in terms of raw excitement , it has gained the total acceptance that the preservation of human life comes first			0
" whatever is happening to a car , there should be no reason to die in a car , " seven - time @entity170 tells @entity117			2
" 1 " will be shown at the @entity176 in october and is available for download on @entity178 in the @entity97 from october 1			0
customers who watch " @entity15 " and " 1 " may also like ... ' @entity180 ' this moving portrait of the late @entity182 resonated with both critics and moviegoers becoming an instant classic when it was released in 2010			1
directed by @entity187 , " @entity154 " tells the story of @entity182 's three - time world champion from his karting days in the late 1970s to his tragic death , aged 34 , at @entity155 in may 1994			1
@entity154 was compassionate and charismatic off the track and fearless , sometimes reckless , on it			0
the combination made him a global superstar that transcended the sport			0
rare archive footage and interviews with a string of ex-drivers , officials and journalists combine to create a searing portrait of arguably the greatest driver to ever race an @entity2 car			2
' @entity2 ' the 1966 @entity17 - winning tale of a fictional motor racing season remains a classic of the motorsport genre			1
@entity97 actor @entity211 heads an international cast which includes @entity214 world champion @entity213 and cameos by many of his famous racing contemporaries			0
beautifully directed by @entity218 , " @entity2 " includes some memorable racing scenes from @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and some terrifying footage around the high - speed oval at @entity55 .			1
