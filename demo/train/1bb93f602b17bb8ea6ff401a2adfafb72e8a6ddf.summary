@entity0 -- technical experts directing the salvage operation aboard the @entity7 cruise ship are recommending that the underwater part of the operation be called off because it is becoming too dangerous , @entity3 's civil protection agency said tuesday			1
the head of the operation , @entity12 , will make the final decision , but is unlikely to go against the recommendations of the technical experts , his office said			1
the advice is based on safety concerns and follows consultations with relatives of the people still missing from the shipwreck and diplomats representing their countries , the civil protection agency said			1
a total of 15 people remain missing after the cruise ship 's collision with rocks off the coast of @entity31 on january 13			1
seventeen bodies have been recovered			2
there were about 4,200 people on the cruise liner when it crashed			1
@entity37 , captain of the @entity7 , said that after the ship hit the rocks , he ran it aground off @entity41 to keep it from sinking and limit the tilting			1
it came to rest on its starboard , or right , side , with roughly 50 % of the ship under water			2
it is currently rotated nearly 90 degrees			2
salvage operations in the part of the ship above the water line will continue , @entity12 's office said , as will searches of 7 square miles ( 18 square kilometers ) of sea around the wreck			1
underwater operations have previously been temporarily suspended for safety reasons , but have always resumed			2
technical experts are now advising that they come to a permanent end			1
@entity37 is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter , causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board			1
he denies the charges , saying his actions saved lives			2
@entity37 has admitted to prosecutors , defense attorneys and a judge that he made a " mistake " in colliding with the rocks off shore			2
but he has brushed aside suggestions that he was going too fast , as prosecutors allege			0
the lead prosecutor in the case is asking that @entity37 be sent back to jail			0
a hearing has been scheduled for february 6			0
but @entity37 's lawyer says he should be released from house arrest			1
officials are particularly concerned for divers who are searching submerged areas of the ship amid a sea of debris that includes heavy items and wires , they said sunday			1
the ship jolted slightly and then slowly moved even further , totaling about 4 centimeters over a few hours , @entity12 said sunday			0
the ship 's movement renewed fears that the vessel could slide farther			0
earthquakes in the region last week also stoked fears that the ship could plunge deeper into the water			0
@entity12 said that if the ship does not slip into deeper water , it will take at least seven to 10 months to remove the wreckage			0
and that process wo n't begin until after the fuel is removed , which could take 28 working days once it begins			0
in the meantime , there will be no fishing , diving , snorkeling , or other normal use of the water near the wreckage , extending the disaster 's economic toll			0
a number of survivors have filed lawsuits against the company that ran the cruise , @entity126			0
@entity126 has announced it was offering each of about 3,200 passengers who had been aboard the vessel a lump sum of 11,000 euros ( $ 14,400 ) , in compensation for their loss of property and emotional distress , as well as a refund of costs associated with the cruise			0
separate agreements will be reached with those passengers who were injured and needed treatment at the scene and with the families of those who died , @entity126 said .			0
