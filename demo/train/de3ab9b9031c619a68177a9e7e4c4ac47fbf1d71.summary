an independent assessment of @entity2 surveillance ordered by president @entity3 recommends a controversial program aimed at collecting @entity6 ' electronic communications remain in place			1
but the effort predominantly covering so - called metadata relating to phone records and e-mail must have tighter constraints and greater transparency , according to the report released on wednesday by the @entity15			1
some 40 recommendations -- considered modest in scope -- were offered by the group on how the @entity6 should continue collecting and storing data domestically and abroad			2
among them are calls for greater judicial oversight and more public transparency			0
" because our adversaries operate through the use of complex communications technologies , the @entity2 , with its impressive capabilities and talented officers , is indispensable to keeping our country and our allies safe and secure , " said the report 's executive summary			0
the panel was created amid a political firestorm that followed leaks last summer by former @entity2 contractor @entity37			1
the disclosures triggered outrage among civil libertarians and many members of @entity43 , who considered the degree of data collection an overreach of post- 9/11 anti-terror efforts			0
leaks about surveillance and a secret court that works with the @entity2 put enormous pressure on @entity3 , who came into office promising a more transparent government			1
5 questions about the @entity2 ruling key members of @entity43 are considering changes to programs under the @entity60 law to restrict @entity2 snooping programs			0
" the message is very clear , " @entity63 chairman @entity62 said following the report 's release			0
" @entity2 , you 've gone too far			0
" @entity62 mentioned the section in law allowing telephone data collection " was not essential to preventing attacks , " according to the report			2
that directly contradicts national security officials , who have said the authority had helped thwart terror plots both in the @entity6 and abroad			2
" just because we can collect massive amounts of data does n't mean we should do so , " @entity62 said			0
read the report here the review panel said that when government officials consider national security risks , they should also consider risks to privacy , freedom , civil liberties , relationships and trade with other nations			2
it also recommended new limits on spying on foreigners and foreign leaders following controversy around disclosures of @entity6 snooping on overseas presidents , like @entity99 's @entity98			1
the panel said intelligence officials should weigh if a foreign leader is believed to be duplicitous , if another country has a cooperative relationship with the @entity6 and the political and diplomatic fallout if the leader became aware of such surveillance			1
heads of state in @entity110 and @entity99 have been among those expressing recent outrage at alleged surveillance by the @entity6 government in their countries			2
the independent panel said spying on foreigners should only be conducted to protect national security and @entity6 allies , not directed for economic issues such as trade secret theft			1
@entity37 's open letter offers to help @entity110 investigate @entity2 surveillance @entity125 , the former acting @entity126 director and member of the panel , said the recommendations are not " in any way disarming " the intelligence community by removing tools needed to protect the @entity6			1
fellow panel member @entity132 , a former top counter-terrorism official in two administrations , said the recommendations also are not a signal that the fight against terrorism has ended			0
additionally , @entity3 will deliver a speech likely in january on the path forward following the report recommendations , which include presidential oversight of monitoring of foreign leaders and agreements with nations like @entity146 and @entity99 on what is acceptable and what is not			1
@entity3 met on wednesday with members of the review group to discuss their findings			1
he has to decide which of the recommendations will be accepted , which could be revised and which will be rejected			0
@entity3 vowed this month to find ways of reforming the @entity2 , though he also defended the agency 's work			0
release of the findings came two days after a federal judge in @entity162 ruled preliminarily that @entity2 data collection of telephone metadata was probably unconstitutional on privacy grounds			0
opinion : who broke the law , @entity37 or the @entity2 ? the group 's other recommendations included : -- subjecting @entity6 citizens and foreigners to the same privacy standards -- urging that the @entity6 government support , and not undermine , encryption standards -- tightening classified information protection , including more monitoring and routine vetting of people who access classified information			1
and background investigations should be done by government employees or by a nonprofit private company , not for - profit firms criticized for not thoroughly vetting contractors hired by the @entity2 , like @entity37 , the group advised .			0
