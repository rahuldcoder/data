-- romance runs rich through @entity3 's veins , with icons of amore to melt the hardest heart			1
but the most famous sight is n't always the most swoon - worthy ; find the real romance of @entity3 with a hot date at one of these alternative picks			2
@entity12 romance icon : @entity15 's balcony			1
the dainty stone balcony at the 14th - century @entity17 is a magnet for lovers ( and @entity21 fans )			2
visiting romantics scrawl heart - rending graffiti in the charming courtyard and smooch on the balcony with their own @entity26			2
it 's all rather lovely , which means tourists generally remain untroubled by the lack of any connection between the fictional lovers and the @entity35 noblemen who actually lived here			2
the alternative : the @entity38 arena by night			2
if literature 's star - crossed lovers do n't inspire , spend a balmy evening at @entity12 's 1st - century @entity38 amphitheater			1
find a space for two on the steep stone steps , and the evening is yours to sip wine , be dazzled by on - stage theatrics , and gaze at a starry sky			2
take snacks , a blanket and most essentially , a pillow ( those stone steps have seriously bum - numbing qualities )			2
thrifty lovers can snap up tickets for summer operas and ballets from as little as 10 euros ( www.arena.it )			1
@entity0 : @entity3 for honeymooners @entity58 romance icon : a gondola ride			1
climbing aboard @entity58 's iconic boats to drift around the city 's canals , to the tune of a singing gondolier , is the holy grail of @entity3 's romantic experiences			1
that is , until you see the price tag			0
there 's no doubting the beauty of @entity58 from the water , but the pleasure does n't come cheap ( and yes , they do charge extra for the singing )			1
the alternative : a bicycle made for two			0
flee the flocks of visitors in central @entity58 with a summer ferry excursion to @entity83			1
with a day 's bicycle hire , you and your date can pedal around the shady streets and catch some r&r away from @entity58 's manic center			1
check out www.lidoonbike.it , who can set you up with the most kitsch date there is , a two - seater tandem bike			0
@entity95 romance icon : @entity97			0
throw in one coin , and you 'll return to @entity95 someday			0
throw in two , you 'll marry an @entity101			0
throw in more than that and well , desperate is not a good look			0
lovers line up to take each other 's photo next to this jaw - dropping edifice , but crowds and coin - hurling visitors do n't make for a dream date			1
the alternative : the dome of @entity113			1
who would have thought the holiest of holies is the perfect place for a secret kiss ? start early for a climb to the top of @entity121 's gigantic dome ( but spare yourself the blisters and take the lift part - way )			1
if you 're there for the opening time of 8 a.m. , you 'll likely have a hazy view of @entity121 all to yourselves , and ample space for a quick smooch			1
@entity0 : @entity3 : a volcano - lover 's guide @entity133 romance icon : @entity135			0
with the muscular form of @entity139 setting hearts a-flutter outside the @entity140 , and comely @entity142 maidens in every gallery , it 's the artistic heart of @entity133 that plucks at the heart strings			0
and nowhere elicits lovelorn sighs more than the @entity135 , with emblems of love like @entity149 's " @entity148 " gracing its walls			0
but museum fatigue from the brain - boggling volume of art , not to mention bumping elbows with hordes of other visitors , can sap that lovin ' feeling			1
these gardens , a short walk from the @entity135 , are a perfect lovers ' escape ( learn more on the official website )			0
the further you wander into the gardens , the more secluded spaces you 'll find			0
seek out a manicured corner of @entity133 's most beautiful green space , breathe in the scent of citrus trees and sigh among statues of bathing nymphs			0
