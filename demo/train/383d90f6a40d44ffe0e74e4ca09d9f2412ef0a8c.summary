media mogul @entity7 is lining up a bid along with @entity10 billionaire @entity9 , according to @entity11 -- which is owned by @entity7 's @entity12 but the 80 - year - old @entity1 , who runs @entity2 on behalf of @entity6 since selling his rights to the private equity firm in 2006 , said such a deal would not be in the commercial interests of the sport			1
" @entity2 is not for sale			0
and , anyway , we would not sell to a media company because it would restrict the ability to negotiate with other broadcasters , " he told @entity21 newspaper @entity20 on wednesday			1
@entity1 , who first secured the rights to negotiate television contracts for races in the late 1970s , said @entity12 had not made any approach to @entity6			1
" if they were interested for sure they would have called me and they have n't , " he told @entity30			0
" if someone was to come along with an enormous offer , a lot more than it were worth , then they have to look at it			0
they have never talked about selling , though			0
" the current @entity40 between the @entity2 teams expires next year , and @entity42 -- one of eight marques on the grid who made a failed breakaway bid in 2009 before signing the deal -- is reportedly among the parties seeking to wrest control of the sport from @entity1			2
the @entity21 entrepreneur has been helping @entity54 prosecutors investigating @entity55 , who handled @entity2 's sale to @entity6 five years ago			1
@entity55 , who has been arrested under suspicion of fraud , is a former employee of state - run @entity58 -- which had a stake in @entity2 up to 2006			2
" i have been co-operating with the @entity62 's investigation of the affairs of dr. @entity55 since the outset , " @entity1 said in a statement last week			2
" when i was informed that there was a first suspicion in relation to my perceived involvement in the matter , i went to see the senior state prosecutor and her team in @entity72 earlier this month to clear up any allegations against me			0
" i am confident that when the full facts have been established , i will be exonerated of blame for any wrongdoing			0
