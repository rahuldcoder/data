@entity0 -- for @entity2 , seeing double has always been the norm			0
growing up alongside twin @entity6 , the @entity5 - born 16 - year - old has never thought twice about the frequency of twins around him			2
but , late last year , @entity2 was surprised to learn his school could tie the world record for the most twins in the same academic year at one school			2
a dramatic rise in multiple - child pregnancies has left many schools with record - smashing numbers of twins and triplets			1
@entity2 's @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , tied the @entity23 this year for most sets of twins in a grade at 16			1
the high school shares the title with @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31			1
the schools , however , may not hold the record for long			0
@entity22 's @entity34 hopes to beat the world record with 18 pair of twins in its class of 2016			1
" i was kind of stunned , " @entity39 , mother of twins @entity41 and @entity42 , said when she learned the @entity34 boasts a total 62 sets of twins in four grades			2
the surprising numbers reflect a rise in multiple births in the @entity49			1
" there 's no question that the number and rate of multiple births has increased substantially in recent years , " @entity50 , an epidemiologist at the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) , explains			1
in a report published earlier this year , the @entity51 found there has been a 76 % increase in the incidence of twins from 1980 to 2009			0
one in every 30 babies born in the @entity49 in 2009 was a twin , compared to 1 in every 53 babies born in 1980			0
" the increase of triplets and higher was almost 400 % , " @entity64 says			0
" you do n't typically see that kind of change occurring naturally			0
" the remarkable increase is largely attributed to the increasingly older age of mothers and the increased use of infertility treatments , which gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s			1
" a lot of it is driven by demographics , " @entity64 explains			0
" moms tend to be older			0
when older women give birth naturally , they are more likely to have twins spontaneously and are more likely to have treatments			2
" it comes as little surprise that two @entity22 high schools have competed for the top twin - related prize			1
@entity22 saw the highest twin birth rate in 2009 with nearly 5 % of all births in the state being twins			1
@entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 were not far behind			0
" i 've noticed there are more twins and triplets , " @entity98 , principal of @entity20 , says			0
" i 'm sure ( our record ) will be very short lived in the @entity23 history			2

@entity22 high school ties the @entity23 for most sets of twins in a class
numbers can be attributed to dramatic increases in the rate of multiple birth pregnancies
multiple births have increased *due* to older age of mothers , increased use of infertility *therapies*
