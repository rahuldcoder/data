in an overshadowed @entity2 contest , @entity0 voted in favor of statehood in a nonbinding referendum , marking the first time such an initiative garnered a majority			1
@entity0 were asked about their desires in two parts			2
first , by a 54 % to 46 % margin , voters rejected their current status as a @entity15 commonwealth			1
in a separate question , 61 % chose statehood as the alternative , compared with 33 % for the semi-autonomous " sovereign free association " and 6 % for outright independence			1
while the results may be an indicator of what @entity0 want , statehood will not be possible without congressional action in @entity26 , something that is not guaranteed			2

" i think people just came to realize that the current relationship simply does not create the number of jobs that we need , " he said			0
an exodus of residents from the island has culminated in a staggering statistic : fifty - eight percent of @entity0 live in the mainland @entity15 , @entity30 said			1
opinion : treat @entity15 citizens in @entity0 fairly " when you have a political status that scares away half of your population , it is time to reject that political status , " he said			1
but some analysts say the views on statehood have not changed , despite tuesday 's results			2
the preference of many voters is to consider a report by the @entity64 administration that lays out several noncolonial options before choosing an alternative status , said @entity67 , a political scientist at the @entity70 - @entity69			2
this option , which is supported by the party that won the governorship , did not appear on the ballot			0
" this is n't to say that support for statehood has n't increased ; it has , " @entity67 said			0
" but the only thing we can decipher with certainty from the vote is that the people of @entity0 want a change to the current status			1
" it is n't clear what change we want , but we want change , " he said			0
the results of the referendum met with other criticisms , too			0
there were voters who prefer the current status but did n't agree with the way it was defined on the ballot , thereby inflating the number of votes against the status quo , said @entity101 , a history professor at the @entity70			1
secondly , a large number of ballots -- one - third of all votes cast -- were left blank on the question of preferred alternative status			0
if you assume those blank votes are anti-statehood votes , the true result for the statehood option would be less than 50 % , @entity107 argues			0
opinion : ' but what 's a @entity115 ? ' but @entity30 accounts for the number of blank votes by explaining that those who voted to keep the current status would have left the question of alternatives blank			1
the referendum is nonbinding , but it compels lawmakers in @entity26 to act , he said			0
" the people are withdrawing their consent to be governed the way they are governed , " @entity30 said , citing the @entity122 , which states that a government 's power comes from the consent of those governed			0
" @entity130 will have to address this and will have to pay attention , " he said			0
the roughly 4 million residents of @entity0 are @entity15 citizens but ca n't vote for president			1
however , the almost 5 million @entity0 living in the 50 @entity15 states have full voting rights			2
under its status as a commonwealth , @entity0 is subject to @entity15 federal laws , though island residents are exempt from some federal taxes			1
@entity0 has a nonvoting representative in @entity130			0
the territory played a role in presidential politics this year during the @entity147 primaries , when candidates @entity148 and @entity150 visited the island , seeking its delegates for the primary election			0
@entity150 , a former @entity154 senator , created a small political firestorm when he said @entity156 should be the principal language in @entity0 before it could gain statehood			2
@entity148 said he would have " no preconditions " on language for @entity0 to gain statehood , though during a @entity160 debate , he said @entity156 should be the @entity15 ' official language			1
last year , president @entity64 made an official visit to @entity0 , the first such visit by a president in 50 years .			0

in a nonbinding referendum , @entity0 voted on island 's status as a @entity15 commonwealth
a majority rejected the current status and favored statehood as an alternative
it is the first time a majority of voters chose statehood
but analysts find problems drawing conclusions from the vote
