-- @entity2 's red light district pulsates with neon lights			2
women stand on nearly every corner -- many from @entity7 -- aggressively making their pitch to men walking by			1
inside one particularly loud bar , young @entity12 women sit on the laps of male customers			0
and @entity15 ? well , you might walk right by its equivalent and never notice			0
@entity19 is a commercial area , the address of several banks			0
in its heyday , dozens of girls used to ply their trade here			0
now , you can find only three or four women who work the street			0
that stark difference may explain why @entity29 is being hailed as a model of how to combat sex trafficking , while @entity32 has been called the " @entity33 "			1
so , what happened ? in 1995 , @entity29 passed a tough bill that cracked down on prostitution			1
what made this law different , however , was who would be held responsible for the crime of prostitution			1
it 's not illegal to sell sex			1
it is , however , illegal to buy sex			1
the law was enacted as part of @entity29 's push for gender equality			1
from a @entity29 legal point of view , any woman selling sex has been forced to do so , either by circumstance or coercion			1
anyone caught buying sex faces hefty fines , an embarrassingly public police notification and possible time in prison , with a maximum four - year sentence			1
so far no one arrested has served time			0
according to the @entity29 justice ministry , more than 70 % in recent polls supported the law			1
buying sex is looked down upon			2
there is even a slang term for those who buy sex			1
" they 're called a " cod , " a fish , " says @entity68 , a @entity29 prosecutor of organized crime			1
" it 's the same word as a loser , or [ someone who ] gets called by the police , or runs out of gas in his car			2
you 're a loser if you buy sex in @entity29			1
" we see it as a human right to have sexual integrity , physical integrity , and not to be forced to sell your body to strange men , 10 times a day			2
that 's human rights to us			0
" at first , @entity29 's neighbours in @entity92 dismissed the idea			2
but the law had an interesting knock - on effect , decreasing demand for prostitution and thereby sex trafficking			1
@entity99 , @entity29 's @entity100 on @entity101 , has undertaken annual assessments on the problem since the law was enacted			1
she recalls attending international meetings back in 1998 when @entity29 was ridiculed for its approach			1
" i mean , i was told you ca n't do that			0
it 's impossible , " she recalls			0
" people could not even get it into their minds that it would have any effect on trafficking			2
but now i get the impression that people have stopped laughing and actually are looking seriously into what can we do			0
" police say it 's working ; that customers do n't want to risk punishment and that intelligence indicated pimps and traffickers quickly realized it was not worth bringing women into @entity29			1
simply , there is not enough money to be made and the risk is too high			0
but trafficking still exists and women still sell sex in @entity29			1
one young woman told @entity0 she was promised a cleaning job in @entity29 -- but within hours of arriving in the country she was locked in an apartment , raped and beaten and had her passport taken away from her			1
while street prostitution has dropped dramatically , selling sex over the internet is still a thriving industry			2
but @entity15 police estimate that there are only about 200 prostitutes now working in a capital city of more than 2 million people			2
it 's all in stark contrast to @entity2			0
@entity32 decriminalized prostitution in 1999			1
the idea , in part , was that making it legal to sell sex would also make it easier to police			1
there are conditions , however : pimping is illegal and only legal residents can work as prostitutes			2
since then , @entity2 's red light district has grown			0
the women walking the streets have also changed			0
about half used to be @entity32 , according to national police			1
now most are @entity7 or from eastern @entity92			0
there are no hard numbers on how many have been trafficked but social workers believe the vast majority are " vulnerable " to trafficking			2
@entity169 , an anti-trafficking activist with @entity170 , walks the streets of @entity2 almost every night , hoping to reach out to victims			0
she says she has seen the number of prostitutes from @entity7 triple in just two years , although specific numbers are difficult			0
" what we 've got on the streets is the tip of the iceberg basically , " she says			0
the reality in @entity2 is that the majority of prostitutes are managed by pimps , even though it 's illegal			2
complicating matters , many of the pimps and traffickers are themselves prostitutes , attempting to work their way out of the street by managing new recruits			0
" we thought that these women would be trapped and kidnapped and they wanted to be saved and rescued and they wanted to go back home , " says @entity193 of the @entity194			0
" but what we found out is that this is a much more complex phenomenon			0
" @entity32 police have to figure out which prostitutes are in the country illegally , which prostitutes may be victims of trafficking and which prostitutes may also be pimps and traffickers			1
they believe that 95 % of the prostitutes in @entity32 are already familiar with prostitution when they arrive , know they need to cooperate with pimps to get on , and are not used to working with law enforcement			1
the police try to establish which of the prostitutes are there legally : those who are not will be transferred to the department that deals with illegal immigrants			2
@entity32 's @entity217 coordinates police and social services to effectively identify trafficking victims			1
when police raid a brothel , social workers are on hand			2
when they have identified a possible victim of trafficking , they are placed in a safe house for a " reflection period " of up to 100 days			2
if , at the end of that time , the victims have not cooperated with police to prosecute their traffickers , they are deported			0
" of course , we tell them [ that ] in the hope that they will tell us at least a little bit of the true story , " says @entity193			0
" because of course many of them are scared to tell their stories			0
and they 're also scared that the authorities get to know about them			0
" but most victims fail to cooperate , too scared to testify against their traffickers , walking out of safe houses and disappearing just before their " reflection period " ends			0
politicians in @entity32 are now debating whether to adopt a @entity29 - style approach to the problem			1
in @entity29 justice ministry officials say they have had an increase for requests from other countries to explain how their anti-prostitution law works and how it might be adapted			1
" the important thing is that any country should think about the question on demand			0
" says @entity262 , @entity29 's minister of justice , " because you ca n't fight this organized criminality , which is often behind prostitution and trafficking for sexual purposes			1
you ca n't fight that by only looking to one side of the coin			0
if we could get rid of slavery , then i think this type of buying human beings is something that we have to fight too			0

@entity281 neighbors @entity32 and @entity29 have taken different approaches to sex trafficking
@entity29 law says it is not illegal to sell sex -- but it is illegal to buy sex
in @entity32 prostitution has been decriminalized with the aim of making it easier to police
politicians in @entity32 are now debating whether to adopt a @entity29 - style approach
