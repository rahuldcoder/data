-- for years , @entity0 has been advising readers to rent short - term apartments whenever they plan to spend more than a few days in expensive cities like @entity4 and @entity5			1
short - term apartment rentals can help travelers save money on both lodging and meals , while providing a more authentic experience			1
regardless of recent headlines concerning new rules -- or supposed new efforts to enforce old rules -- for short - term rentals , we still endorse the option as a smart , fun and safe way to stay			1
while there may be new implications for owners seeking to rent out their properties in these cities , renters themselves face no possibility of fines or problems of any kind with the local authorities			2
" there 's nothing illegal that the traveler is doing when staying in a vacation rental , " says @entity30 , chief development officer of direct - from - owner rental specialist @entity31			1
" none of these cities have any penalties for renters			2
" the announcements of lawmakers and housing officials seem to imply otherwise , hinting that because some home owners may technically be violating unenforced local ordinances by renting out their properties , renters are somehow guilty by association			0
the truth is that based on years of precedent -- and the fact that restrictions are vaguely worded and that the municipalities involved are uninterested or incapable of enforcing them -- the risks encountered by renters are extremely minimal			0
arm yourself with our 6 tips for safer , smarter rentals , and read on for specific advice about @entity4 , @entity60 and @entity5			1
@entity0 : @entity62 's weirdest hotels @entity4 here 's the deal : late last year , city officials started to enforce a 2005 law that restricts owners from renting their properties for periods of less than one year			2
citing a lack of affordable housing in the central city -- always a popular topic among voters , and , yes , this began in a run - up to elections -- mayor @entity76 ordered a local housing agency to warn some of the estimated 38,000 offenders that they were violating the law by renting flats for shorter spans			0
how many warning letters did the housing authority send out ? as of midsummer 2010 , about 25			0
" for the moment , " says one property owner who prefers to remain anonymous , " any enforcement of this law is minimal to the point of being invisible			0
" if enforcement efforts are ever ramped up substantially , short - term rentals could be harder to come by in @entity4			1
even though no owners have been hit with the maximum € 25,000 ( more than $ 32,000 ) fine for violating housing regulations , the possibility of such a fine will probably be enough to turn some short - term listings into long - term rentals			1
bottom line : in @entity4 , there has been no noticeable drop - off in owners posting short - term apartment rentals			1
at last check , @entity31 listed an all - time high of 1,605 properties in @entity4			2
@entity0 : the coolest small towns in @entity105 @entity60 here 's the deal : @entity60 's obscure , long - ignored law prohibiting rentals of less than 30 days is nearly 30 years old , but few people thought about it until news arose about crackdowns on tourist rentals in other cities			1
rather than inquire as to the legality of such rentals , the city has traditionally preferred to subject owners to the local 14 percent hotel tax , bringing in millions annually that would not have been raised had the properties been occupied year - round by owners or long - term renters for the sake of the city budget , there 's an obvious incentive to keep ignoring the ordinance			1
@entity5 here 's the deal : of the trio of cities , @entity5 is the only one to actually pass new rental legislation			1
as in @entity4 and @entity60 , the primary target is not the small - time owner who rents out a place from time to time			2
instead , the focus is on " illegal hotel " operations : large - scale attempts to convert residential apartments intended for permanent occupants into travel accommodations			0
so how will the law be enforced , and exactly what rental scenarios will be deemed illegal when the rules become effective as of may 1 , 2011 ? no one 's entirely sure			0
@entity0 : confessions of ... a @entity150 cast member state assembly member @entity151 , the cosponsor of the bill , was quoted as saying , " somebody who is going away on vacation and once in a blue moon rents the apartment is probably not going to be affected by this			0
that 's right : even the bill 's cosponsor ca n't say exactly how the law will play out			0
nominally , the purpose behind the legislation is to provide more affordable housing for city residents and to protect travelers from sketchy quasi hotels			0
but the law might not have become a reality had it not been for the lobbying of hotel and motel associations -- which obviously compete with vacation rentals , and which would obviously benefit if travelers turned away from short - term rentals en masse			1
among all the confusion and uncertainty , one thing is clear : travelers want their vacation rentals			0
in the second quarter of this year , @entity31 recorded a 104 percent increase in inquiries for @entity5 apartments compared with the same period in 2009			2
