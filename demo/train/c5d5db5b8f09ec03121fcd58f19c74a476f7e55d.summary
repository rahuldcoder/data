when jury selection gets underway in a @entity3 courtroom on monday , attorneys may be hard - pressed to find jurors untainted by news of the case against @entity7			1
lurid details about how the former waitress seduced her lover and left a trail of pictures depicting their sex play , before shooting and nearly decapitating him , created a media sensation for months during her 2013 trial			1
a new jury will be tasked with determining punishment after her first jury found her guilty of first - degree murder but deadlocked on whether she should be put to death for the 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend , @entity7 , who was stabbed 29 times , had his neck slit from ear to ear and shot in the face			1
" she 's very scared , " said @entity31 , a friend of @entity32			1
" things changed for her			1
she came to the realization that she did n't want the death penalty			1
she wants to be able to see her mom and her family			1
" after efforts to settle the case went nowhere and legal motions to drop the death penalty were denied , @entity32 will resume the fight for her life with the help of a lead attorney , @entity46 , that she neither wants or trusts			1
" i do not trust his advice and especially do not trust how he might conduct himself towards me because i know from personal experience that he is curt , rude and condescending , " she wrote in a 12 - page , single - spaced handwritten letter to the judge in october of 2013			2
when her efforts to replace him were unsuccessful , she persuaded the judge to let her represent herself , but then changed her mind weeks before the start of her retrial			2
the defense team is made up of @entity58 , @entity59 and mitigation specialist @entity60			2
sex , lies and digital images while @entity32 has the same defense team , trial strategy could be a lot different if @entity58 follows the advice of jury foreman @entity66 , who shared his thoughts with the defense team when they met with him to discuss the case			1
" @entity7 is her own worst enemy			1
she 's a terrible defendant , " said @entity66 , one of the four jurors who voted to spare her life			2
" i was candid with them			2
i told them it was best if she were not on the stand			2
" " the strategy this time is to keep @entity85 off the stand , " said a source close to the defense			2
" however , @entity85 has a mind of her own			2
" @entity32 spent 18 days on the witness stand recalling the minutiae of her allegedly abusive relationship with @entity93 , but claimed to have no recollection of the actual attack			2
the trial was rife with sex , lies and digital images , including graphic autopsy photos that showed @entity93 's body			2
but the 2013 hung jury brought to a close a dramatic chapter in a high - profile case that lasted months , drawing spectators who lined up for courtroom seats and waited anxiously outside the courthouse			1
emotions ran high in the courtroom as the jury 's inability to agree on a sentence was announced			1
@entity32 appeared to be on the verge of tears			0
one of @entity93 's sisters sobbed			0
even the normally stoic judge 's voice cracked as she dismissed jurors			0
" ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the participants in this trial , i wish to thank you for your extraordinary service to this community , " she told them			0
" this was not your typical trial			0
you were asked to perform very difficult responsibilities			0
" an alternate juror and a juror who was on the panel cried as the verdict was being read			0
as the jury filed out of the courtroom , one juror said , " i 'm sorry " to @entity93 's family			1
jurors had deliberated for more than 13 hours in the penalty phase of the trial when they told the court they would n't be able to agree on a verdict			1
" we 'll never know what happened , and whatever triggered that rage , " said @entity66			0
" she must be held accountable			0
but up until then , she had led a relatively normal life			0
" witnesses threatened and intimidated ? the jury foreman found mitigating evidence in her lack of criminal history and was not persuaded by the state 's argument that the murder was premeditated			1
despite the heavy social media backlash from people who wanted the death penalty for @entity32 , @entity66 said time has only made him more comfortable with in his decision			1
@entity32 needs only to persuade one juror to vote in her favor to avoid the death penalty			1
while the odds may seem favorable , it is a formidable challenge for a defense team that has complained that their witnesses have been threatened , intimidated and bullied into silence by " haters " who loathe @entity32			0
" it 's impossible to get a fair trial with all the publicity this case has received , " said a source close to the defense			1
" we had several witnesses who backed down because they are so afraid to support @entity85			0
" the jury is expected to hear the state argue that the murder was especially cruel and heinous , a violent attack that included dozens of stab wounds , a knife wound to the neck that went down to the spine , and a bullet to the head			1
@entity32 ' behavior before and after the murder -- allegedly stealing her grandfather 's gun , getting rid of incriminating evidence , including the weapons used in the attack , and a rendezvous with a prospective lover hours after killing @entity93 -- are likely fodder for the state 's case for the death penalty			1
the reluctance of defense witnesses to testify may also have something to do with the aggressive style of prosecutor @entity206 , whose cross of defense expert @entity208 caused her such anxiety she sought medical help during the trial			0
she refused to return for the retrial , telling @entity215 's @entity214 : " threats to my life , threats to my family			0
my family does n't want me to go back			0
" @entity208 was n't the only defense witness raked over the coals by @entity206 , who mocked the professionalism of defense psychologist @entity223 , suggesting his judgment was clouded by his fondness for @entity32			0
the psychologist testified that one of the reasons for @entity32 ' amnesia was post-traumatic stress disorder			0
the exchanges between @entity206 and @entity223 became so heated during trial that defense attorney @entity59 pleaded with the judge to intervene and " tell ( the prosecutor ) stop yelling at the witness			0
" while some of @entity32 ' witnesses have abandoned the case , the defense has cobbled together a " handful of witnesses , " their names kept secret and their testimony spared the pressure of live tv coverage by a court order , said the source close to the defense			1
judge @entity250 ruled that while tv cameras will be permitted in the retrial , no video can be aired until a verdict has been rendered			0
her decision came after the defense argued that live tv coverage would keep their witnesses from testifying			0
" there will be people testifying that now feel safe where they did n't before , " said @entity31 , @entity32 ' friend			0
" i think there will be a lot of surprises			0
