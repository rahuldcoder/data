" thanks for the nomination @entity12 , " jokes a young man in a @entity2 clip pouring what he says is a new , unopened bottle of @entity6 spirits into a pint glass along with another , unidentified drink			0
as the liquids mix , he observes : " and that is congealing nicely ... whew ... okay , " before knocking back the potion			0
after a brief pause he declares : " i nominate [ he names some friends ]			0
you 've got 24 hours lads			0
" the game , known as @entity23 , is thought to have originated in @entity24 and is now sweeping the world			1
it involves you filming yourself downing a drink -- often alcoholic and of large quantities -- and then nominating a friend to outdo you			0
all this is posted on social media -- be it @entity33 or @entity2			1
but what started for some as fun has turned deadly ; at least five men aged under 30 have died after drinking deadly cocktails			1
now health professionals are warning young people of the risks of consuming large amounts of alcohol in a short time			0
" this is a lethal game , " dr. @entity45 , medical adviser for the @entity47 - based charity drinkaware , told @entity48			2
" the point about alcohol is that it affects your ability to recognize that you 're in danger , and it absolutely affects your ability to react to danger			0
so we have a double whammy			0
" there appears to be no limit to the type of drinks that are consumed , and in what matter			1
each nomination becomes more and more daring and outlandish			0
it started as exhibitionism with this woman stripping in the supermarket and downing a drink , but the bravado has escalated into extreme cocktails : one mixes spirits with a dead mouse , in another a man drinks out of a toilet , and the craze has seen players consume alcohol with goldfish , insects , engine oil and dog food			1
unsurprisingly the trend has prompted politicians to demand that schools play a bigger role			2
" the @entity33 drinking game @entity90 has gone viral , and very sadly young people have died as a result , " said @entity47 opposition spokesman @entity88			1
" what role do schools have in building resilience in our young people to resist peer pressure ? " the role of social media giants like @entity33 is also coming under scrutiny			1
@entity102 , whose own son has played the game , demanded that those companies face up to their responsibilities			2
his son was nominated and pressured to play the game but drank water instead of vodka so as not to harm himself			2
" i was cross with him but more cross with the social media involved and the way this game has just spread , " @entity102 said			1
" the whole thing is madness and it needs some kind of sharp and swift action on the part of these social networks to stop it			2
" @entity33 said in a statement : " we do not tolerate content which is directly harmful , for example bullying , but behavior which some people may find offensive or controversial is not always necessarily against our rules			1
" we encourage people to report things to us which they feel breaks our rules so we can review and take action on a case by case basis			0
" but dr. @entity135 rejected this defense , saying @entity33 must recognize its own role in the game			1
" it 's very difficult in this day of personal liberties to say that @entity33 should n't be condoning this or taking these videos offline			1
" personally , i would like to see that happening			0
frankly , if the thrill was n't there , your mates were n't seeing you , i expect it would very rapidly fizzle out			0
