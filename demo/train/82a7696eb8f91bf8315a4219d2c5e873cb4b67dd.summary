-- it still makes @entity3 's eyes widen whenever the @entity5 cleaning worker sees a bar of barely used soap on a bathroom counter			1
" this , " she says , picking it up with a gloved hand and dropping it in a brown bucket , " is valuable where i come from			0
" the 35 - year - old grew up in a mountainous region of southern @entity18 where soap can cost more than a day 's wages			1
because some in the region , could not wash , they got sick			2
across the globe , 2.4 billion people do not have access to clean sanitation , according to the @entity27			1
an estimated 1.5 million children die every year because their immune systems are not mature enough to battle diarrheal and respiratory diseases spread in contaminated environments			1
@entity33 related to contaminated water supplies and poor human hygiene tend to plague poorer regions in @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity40 and the @entity41			2
water - borne illnesses such as cholera can hit countries suddenly , particularly in the wake of a natural disaster where there is little infrastructure previously in place to handle sustainable cleanup and recovery			1
a recent example is @entity54			0
hit by an earthquake in january 2010 , many @entity54 were forced to live in tent camps and use water that was contaminated			2
incidents of cholera plagued the country , a problem that continues today			0
politically vulnerable nations or countries in the grip of war are also breeding grounds for sickness caused by poor sanitation			2
illness tends to spread quicker when people are forced into cramped and overcrowded refugee camps where there are few bathrooms or none at all			2
@entity3 , who says she was the victim of religious persecution in @entity18 , came to the @entity77 several years ago			0
her immigration liaison connected her with a job cleaning hotel rooms			0
in her home country , she personally had access to soap			1
but coming from a place with little sanitation to a hotel that observed a spick - and - span ethos was strange			0
" it may be hard for people here to understand because it is so easy to wash , everything is here for you , you do n't ever think about it , " she said			1
" keep in mind that what you do every day may be the biggest task of the day for someone else			0
" each day she works , @entity3 takes a little extra time during her shift to retrieve all gently used bars of soap in each room			2
she and other cleaning staff at this @entity5 typically collect several hundred pounds of soap each month			2
the nonprofit @entity102 , which works with more than 300 hotels across the country , relies on their hard work and many other volunteers to pick up those heavy hauls and deliver it to a reprocessing location near @entity110 , where the soap is stripped , cleaned , reprocessed and then tested to make sure there is no trace of bacteria left			2
the bars are then cut into smaller pieces and shipped to nations such as @entity54 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			0
the founder of the @entity102 , @entity122 , is a @entity120 war refugee and one of the @entity126 @entity125 of 2011			0
" i was shocked just to know how much ( soap ) at the end of the day was thrown away , " @entity122 said			2
each year , hundreds of millions of soap bars are discarded in @entity130 alone			1
" are we really throwing away that much soap at the expense of other people who do n't have anything ? it just does n't sound right			1
" children are key in recent years , international health organizations , including @entity27 and the @entity139 , have had success facilitating better sanitation in needy regions and teaching people the importance of basic hand washing			1
since july 2010 , more than 40 countries and regions have started hand hygiene campaigns , according to the @entity27			2
" it seems so simple , soap and water			1
but imagine never being taught how to do that , " said dr. @entity152 , who leads the @entity154 , @entity155 , and @entity156 team at the @entity139			1
" washing hands is an afterthought for us			0
but at some point in @entity77 history , in the early part of the century , we had to build and improve our water infrastructure			0
" @entity152 has worked in the field of water - borne illnesses for 22 years , specializing in the treatment of cholera , dysentery and typhoid fever			0
he has been part of projects to build latrines in villages in @entity118 and @entity54			0
he also participated in a campaign in @entity118 where school teachers encouraged students to learn how to wash their hands by making it seem cool to join a hand washing club			1
the children were sent home with comic books that explained when and how to wash in the hope that the kids would teach their parents			1
" children are often much more receptive than their parents or other adults because they do n't feel that we are outsiders judging them and telling them they 're living wrong , " @entity152 said			1
" the adults feel less threatened when their children , innocently in the home , pass along what they 've learned			0
to change a community 's habits , reach the children first			1
" colorful messages on cleanliness @entity152 and other health care experts also stress the effectiveness of posting large , brightly colored posters in public places to advocate frequent hand washing			0
many point to the recent success of @entity207 to primarily target children and schools in developing countries			1
the campaign has a bright , cheerful and easily recognized logo , and its website offers tools to use in classrooms and community centers			0
in @entity218 , where children suffer as many as 35 episodes of diarrhea and respiratory infections a year , children celebrated @entity207 ( october 15 ) by performing plays about washing with soap			1
two talk radio shows made it their main topic of conversation			0
in @entity230 , hand - washing facilities were installed in health - care clinics and schools , a huge step forward in a war - torn region that suffers from a shortage of clean water and overcrowding in displacement camps and settlements			1
radio ads also encouraged good hygiene and dispelled myths about illnesses resulting from bad sanitation			0
one 9 - year - old @entity230 girl wrote in an essay that she thought getting diarrhea was a " punishment from @entity250 " until she heard otherwise on the radio			0
in @entity254 , a new animated character named @entity253 helped teach children the importance of hand washing with soap			1
watch a video of @entity253 on @entity260 @entity54 was a big focus of the campaign this year			0
more than 400,000 have been sickened from cholera since the disease emerged in october 2010			0
at a @entity267 school that was rebuilt by @entity268 , children learned a catchy phrase : " good morning , water ! good morning , soap ! goodbye , microbes ! " they then sang a song about why it 's important to wash before eating and after using the bathroom			1
they also practiced washing their hands , a habit the @entity102 hopes they 'll keep after recently sending many bars of soap to the nation			1
@entity3 thinks about her own 15 - year - old daughter when she considers the children whose lives may be saved by her simple task of collecting soap every day			2
" i know that there are little ones who care and need this , " she said , dropping another bar into a bucket			0
" i am proud to do this			0
to be so far away , but to know i reach my people in this way , this makes me happy			2

millions of people in developing countries do n't have access to soap or clean water
many young children die because their immune systems ca n't fight diarrheal diseases
often , experts say , children and their parents do n't even know how to wash their hands
