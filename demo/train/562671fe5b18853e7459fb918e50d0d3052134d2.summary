@entity0 -- upon his surrender , suspected @entity3 marathon bomber @entity2 was placed in the immediate custody of federal authorities and remains under guard at a @entity3 hospital			1
his wounds and limited communication are among the variables that will affect the speed of course of the criminal case			1
attorney general @entity15 announced federal charges on monday against the @entity18 , @entity19 , resident			1
in a criminal complaint unsealed in @entity21 , @entity2 , 19 , was charged with one count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction , namely an improvised explosive device , against persons and property within the @entity28 resulting in death			1
he also was charged with one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death			0
the case against him is death - penalty eligible			1
he could also be charged later in state courts , but for now federal authorities will lead the prosecution			0
this case is being prosecuted by assistant @entity28 attorneys @entity43 and @entity44 from the anti-terrorism and @entity46 of the @entity47 for the @entity48 , with assistance from the @entity50 of the @entity52 's @entity51			1
according to the court filing system , the charges were actually filed sunday under seal			2
the @entity52 in coming weeks will decide whether to actually seek the death penalty			0
attorney general @entity15 would make the final call , but federal government sources tell @entity1 they expect president @entity59 and other top @entity61 officials to have significant input into those discussions			1
federal legal sources also say they expect an outside counsel will be appointed to work with the public defender on the capital punishment aspect , since @entity19 has no death penalty and federal officials there rarely deal with the complex legal maneuverings in such cases			1
one name mentioned is @entity74 , who has worked as a consultant in other high - profile capital cases			2
the @entity78 - based criminal defense attorney and former federal public defender has worked with legal teams representing " @entity81 " @entity81 , @entity83 bomber @entity82 , and most recently , @entity86 mass shooter @entity84			1
@entity87 has earned praise for leading internal negotiations with prosecutors to take the death penalty off the table in favor of the defendant pleading guilty and getting a life sentence			0
some legal experts said the best legal strategy now would be " delay , delay , delay " as long as possible , given the public outrage at the crimes the defendant is alleged to have committed			0
any criminal trial could be many months , if not years away			2
the defendant 's lawyers are expected to waive the " speedy trial " requirement to give them time to prepare would could be a lengthy criminal trial , two government sources indicated			1
the suspect 's medical condition may also delay matters if he is not able to fully assist his counsel in the initial stages			2
@entity2 made an initial appearance in his room on monday before magistrate judge @entity118 at @entity119 , according to a court filing of notes taken at the proceeding			1
he was advised of his rights as well as the charges			1
the government stated the maximum penalties			0
@entity2 agreed to an order of voluntary detention , the court record showed			1
@entity2 declined to answer bail questions and assented to a probable cause hearing on may 30 , 2013 , at 10 am			2
@entity132 the court was satisfied @entity2 was alert and able to respond to the charges			1
he was remanded from the custody of the @entity138 agents present to the @entity139 , the court record showed			0
the federal public defender in @entity3 confirmed @entity141 from that office was in the hospital for the first appearance and confirms he will represent the defendant , at least for now			2
the initial appearance did not constitute an arraignment			0
@entity148 has the option throughout the process to not speak with law enforcement			0
a magistrate will preside over the next two or three appearances , but the case will eventually be referred to a federal district judge			0
federal grand juries are sitting at all times in @entity3 , so @entity148 would face formal charges from an indictment			0
such a preliminary hearing would be presided over by a federal judge			0
a number of pre-trial negotiations would then start , including possible negotiations for a plea deal			0
if no deal can be reached , a criminal trial would commence			0
that raises another potential issue : whether to hold a trial outside of @entity3 because of the enormous publicity and possible community anger at the crimes			0
possible trial venues could be in the western part of the state , in @entity177 or @entity178 , or possibly out - of - state in neighboring @entity180 or @entity181 .			2

attorney general will make final call , but expect @entity61 , other top - level input
@entity2 , 19 , was advised of his rights as well as the charges at hospital
@entity193 's lawyers are expected to waive " speedy trial " requirement , sources said
@entity2 's wounds , limited communication among variables that will affect course of case
