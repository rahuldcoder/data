-- @entity1 believes the remains of her @entity4 rest at the bottom of the @entity6 , with those of other @entity9 servicemen who perished in a little - known @entity11 training mission that went horribly wrong			1
@entity12 considers newly discovered sonar images of two sunken ships proof of this hallowed ground			1
divers recently planted an @entity9 flag on the ruins			1
" this is a burial ground , so it 's very important , " she told @entity0			2
" my uncle 's body was never recovered , and i believe he 's still down there			2
" on april 28 , 1944 , the beaches at @entity26 along the south coast of @entity28 were being used as a training ground because they provided similar conditions to what @entity9 troops would encounter in @entity33 less than two months later			1
thousands of area residents were evacuated			2
the full - scale rehearsal for the @entity37 landing included live fire and fully equipped troops to make it as real as possible			2
the disastrous mission was kept secret , survivors threatened with court - martial if they revealed what happened			1
under the cover of night , an @entity9 convoy headed out into @entity47 , some 15 miles off the coast			1
the plan was for the ships to organize in the same formations as the @entity52 , turn back toward the @entity28 beaches and simulate a landing			1
a small @entity56 warship escorted the convoy , according to @entity9 military documents chronicling the mission			1
a larger destroyer that was to escort the convoy remained behind for repairs , leaving the ships vulnerable , according to a study by military historian @entity63			1
around 2 a.m. , @entity65 torpedo boats opened fire on the convoy , sinking two landing ship tanks , or @entity68 , causing a loss of life greater than that suffered on @entity37 on june 6 , 1944 , according to @entity9 military documents			1
according to declassified military documents , 749 @entity9 servicemen lost their lives during @entity75			1
some have suggested the tally was higher ; others say it was lower			2
fewer than 200 servicemen were killed or wounded at @entity37 on d - day , according to statistics from the @entity83			2
" many of the men did n't have a chance , " his niece , a @entity86 resident , told @entity0			2
" it was pitch black			2
the men did n't have time to react , and many of them ended up drowning with all the heavy gear strapped on their backs			2
" @entity84 was 19 and newly married			2
his family thought he 'd be safe during his deployment to @entity99			0
" he looked so handsome in his @entity103 uniform and we were so proud of him , " said @entity84 's sister @entity100 in a letter			0
" we were n't too worried about his safety , as he had been assigned to the 607th @entity106 , so he would n't be on the front lines			0
" @entity108 , 22 at the time and a gunner 's mate aboard one of the @entity68 , said the loss of life was astonishing			0
" i climbed down the cargo net and just tried to grab as many people as i could , " said @entity108 , 93			0
a third @entity116 was hit in the stern			0
@entity118 , then 20 , scrambled onto the deck			0
" when i got up there , i saw two of the @entity123 on fire , " @entity118 , a @entity120 native , told @entity0			0
" that was the only light we had			0
i could hear the @entity65 torpedo boats buzzing near us , but i could n't see them			1
" he added , " men were on fire jumping off our ship			0
to this day , i still see those men jumping with their gear on into the water			0
" a hospital corpsman , @entity118 , 91 , tried to tend to the wounded			0
" i put a tourniquet on the leg of a guy near me , but there was n't much else i could do for him			0
the whole scene was horrific , " said @entity118			0
a " typographical error in orders " put the @entity123 on a different radio frequency than their escort ship and the @entity56 naval headquarters ashore , according to @entity63 's study			0
the @entity56 escort ship allegedly failed to alert the @entity9 ships to the @entity65 boats because its crew assumed the original notice had already been relayed			1
" whether an absence of either or both of those factors would have had any effect on the tragic events that followed would be impossible to say -- but probably not , " @entity63 wrote			0
in april , autonomous underwater vehicle manufacturer @entity160 and @entity56 's @entity162 produced the first high - definition sonar images of the two @entity116 wreck sites			1
the unmanned underwater vehicle they used is designed to perform intricate oceanographic surveys over large areas and equipped with multiple sonar instruments that capture images of the wreck sites			1
the company data shows that both lsts are about 50 meters below the surface and reach 6 to 8 meters above the seafloor			0
" we hope that the data collected on this mission will shed additional light on this tragic event and help bring some closure to the families who lost their loved ones during @entity75 , " said @entity177 , regional manager of @entity99			1
@entity1 has visited @entity28 several times with @entity75 veterans			1
her uncle 's death remained a mystery for months after the attack			2
in may 1944 , his family received a letter from the military saying he was missing in action , @entity1 said			2
three months later , another letter said he died in action			0
@entity118 said that hours after the failed exercise , he and other survivors were locked in a room and addressed by a military officer			0
" the lieutenant ... tells us we can not divulge any information about what happened or else we 'll be court - martialed , " he said			0
" details of the training exercise attack were kept secret until august 1944 out of fear that it would jeopardize the @entity11 operation , according to military documents			1
@entity118 says he did n't speak to anyone about @entity75 until 1987			1
" even years after the war was over , i felt that i was still under an obligation not to say anything , " he said			0
" when you 're in the service and you 're told something , you stick to it			0
" as a result of @entity75 , the @entity103 took note of several " deficiencies which were rectified for the invasion			1
" defective lifebelts , faulty alarm systems aboard the @entity123 , and flawed lifeboat protocols were among the concerns the @entity103 addressed for @entity11			1
more than 156,000 troops crossed the @entity6 during the d - day invasion approximately six weeks later			1
nearly 10,000 @entity233 troops were killed or wounded			0
" any kind of practice has got to have some good points , " @entity118 said of @entity11 's deadly rehearsal			1
" it sure did n't feel like it right after			0
