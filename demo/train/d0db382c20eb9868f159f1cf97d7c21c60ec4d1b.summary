this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity12 , @entity13 : happy birthday , @entity15 -- first man to run the mile in less than four minutes			2
in more than twice that time , you 'll be up to speed on today 's headlines			1
first up : health care @entity23 : first up , it 's the biggest expansion of the @entity26 health care system in more than forty years			1
and by a vote of 219 - 212 , the @entity26 @entity27 passed a health care reform bill late sunday night			1
this is the same bill that the @entity31 passed last december			1
this means that when president @entity35 signs it , it 's law			1
the @entity27 also passed a set of changes to the @entity31 bill			1
we 're gon na get back to that in just a second			0
but first , you know this health care issue has been controversial			1
we want you to check out some of the reaction to last night 's vote			1
@entity48 , ( @entity49 ) house speaker : thirty - two million more @entity26 having access to health care			1
$ 1.3 trillion saved for the taxpayer and accountability for the insurance companies so they can not come between patients and their doctors			0
@entity48 @entity59 , ( r ) @entity60 : shame on us			0
shame on each and every one of you who substitutes your will and your desires above those of your fellow countrymen			0
@entity35 , @entity69 : this legislation will not fix everything that ails our health care system , but it moves us decisively in the right direction			1
this is what change looks like			1
@entity23 : okay , so the @entity27 passed the bill			1
now what ? well , president @entity35 is expected to sign it today			1
again , as soon as he does that , the @entity31 bill becomes law			1
but how about those changes passed by the @entity27 ? those still need to get through the @entity31			0
that process ca n't start until the president signs the original bill			1
some analysts are saying that the package of changes could inspire a pretty heated battle in the @entity31			0
we 're going to have more on that as the debate gets going			0
another thing that 's going to happen when the president signs the health care bill : lawsuits			1
at least ten states are planning to file suits arguing that parts of the health care bill are unconstitutional			1
president @entity35 's administration says it expects to win any lawsuits filed against the bill			1
promo @entity23 : well , this debate , dominating headlines for months			0
you see our home page here , @entity113			0
now that a health care bill has been passed , some people are calling it a milestone ; others are calling it a mistake			1
that is what our blog , which you see right here , is asking : milestone or mistake ? you can vote in our @entity129 , comment on the subject			0
you know where to find it ; it 's at @entity113			1
in fact , i have a couple comments for you right now			0
@entity138 says " it is a good idea because it 'll keep insurance companies from raising prices			0
" @entity143 , on the other hand , he 's saying " it 's not the answer to the problems our current system has			1
" we want you to share your thoughts -- and firstnames only -- at our blog			0
word to the @entity153 @entity154 , @entity13 : a word to the @entity153 ... subsidize ( verb ) to help or assist by providing money source : @entity159 student @entity160 @entity23 : sunday night , the @entity27 also approved a plan for the government to be the main supplier of student loans			1
right now , you can get loans from the government or from private companies			2
but the government actually subsidizes some of those private loans ; it gives the companies money to guarantee them			2
this new proposal would cut those subsidies out			2
@entity174 gives us a little background on how loans work right now and how this would change the process			1
@entity174 , @entity180 : right now , the government provides about $ 31 billion in student loans			1
the private enterprise banks -- private banks , basically -- provide about $ 67 billion			0
in many cases , they 're guaranteed by the government			0
but really , you can see the private enterprise gives about twice as many loans as the government does			2
now the plan , according to the bill , is basically for the government to rub out the middleman , to stop sort of subsidizing or guaranteeing these loans and be the lender directly to people with loans			1
@entity23 : this proposal still needs to go through the @entity31			2
it 's not a done deal			2
supporters argue that it would save the federal budget more than $ 60 billion over the next 10 years			0
one congressman said it would make college more affordable and keep jobs in @entity26			0
but critics of the plan say it 'll actually put jobs at stake , including thousands of employees at those private lending companies , those banks			0
critics also argue that the change will cause delays in the loan process , because they say the government does n't have enough people to handle all the loans			1
@entity220 @entity221 , @entity13 : time for the shoutout ! who were the 42nd and 43rd presidents of the @entity26 ? were they : a ) @entity226 & @entity225 , b ) @entity225 & @entity228 , c ) @entity228 & @entity231 or @entity49 ) @entity230 & @entity226 ? we 'll give you five seconds on this one -- go ! @entity228 was number 42 and @entity231 was 43			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity239 @entity23 : those two former presidents are working together to try and help victims of january 's devastating earthquake in @entity4			2
the natural disaster killed more than 200,000 people -- was completely catastrophic -- left more than a million others homeless			0
presidents @entity228 and @entity231 were in the @entity247 nation yesterday , meeting with government officials and others who are involved in the relief efforts			0
they were there on behalf of the @entity253 , which they started to raise money for this recovery process			0
according to its web site , the organization has raised more than $ 37 million so far			0
in addition to the meetings , mr. @entity231 and mr. @entity228 spent part of yesterday 's visit touring some of the camps for @entity4 's homeless			2
@entity26 - @entity265 @entity23 : there 's been some tension between the @entity26 and @entity268 lately			2
you 've heard about this on our show			0
it 's especially focused over @entity268 's plans to build new settlements in @entity276			2
this is an area that 's disputed between @entity268 and @entity279			2
the @entity26 , which is trying to help create a @entity281 peace plan , wants @entity268 to stop construction there			0
in a speech to the @entity285 , or @entity285 , secretary of state @entity283 said that the @entity26 has a responsibility " to give credit when it is due and to tell the truth when it is needed			0
" but she said the relationship between the @entity26 and @entity268 is still strong			0
@entity26 secretary of state hillary clinton : for president @entity35 and for me , and for this entire administration , our commitment to @entity268 's security and @entity268 's future is rock - solid , unwavering , enduring and forever			2
@entity23 : @entity268 prime minister @entity298 also spoke at the conference			0
he 's scheduled to sit down with president @entity35 for a meeting at the @entity301 sometime today			1
@entity302 @entity23 : a showdown could be looming between @entity5 and @entity302			1
yesterday , the internet company announced it has stopped censoring , or restricting , its search results in @entity5			1
a company official said , " we very much hope that the @entity5 government respects our decision , though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services			1
" back in 2006 , when @entity302 launched @entity314 , its search engine in @entity5 , it agreed to a @entity5 demand for the company to censor some of its search results			1
at the time , @entity302 argued that offering @entity5 users some information was better than nothing			1
but after alleged cyber-attacks against @entity302 last december , the company stopped the self - censorship , although that only lasted for about a day			1
now , it seems @entity5 will have to decide how it plans to react to this latest announcement			1
blog report @entity23 : a list was posted temporarily at a @entity330 middle school			0
it showed the names of students who had failing grades , and about 500 of you had something to say about it ! @entity337 does n't think " it 's fair to post someone 's grade where anyone can see it			1
" she says " it 's embarrassing and humiliating			2
" a lot of you agreed with that			0
as you can see , our quick poll showed that about two - thirds of you oppose an f - list			0
@entity351 says she does n't " see this working at her school			0
the students would tell the parents ; the parents would get angry and contact the principal			2
" but @entity359 supports the idea , saying " the parents should help their students get off the list and not complain to the school			2
" and @entity365 writes , " the principal did the right thing			0
he motivated half the kids to get off the list			0
it hopefully gets the people who do n't usually care to care about their grades			2
" if you have no idea what we 're talking about , watch this story in our archive			0
select the show from march 17th ! before we go @entity23 : and finally , if you have a fondness for fromage , you 're gon na love today 's before we go segment			1
