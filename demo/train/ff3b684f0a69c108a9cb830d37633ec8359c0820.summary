-- two days after fellow @entity2 sprinter @entity1 received an 18 - month doping suspension , former 100 - meter world - record holder @entity4 was hit with the same penalty after testing positive for the same banned stimulant			1
he called the ruling " unfair " and " patently unjust			0
" @entity4 confirmed thursday in a statement sent to @entity0 through his agent @entity10 , that he had been sanctioned for having oxilofrine in his system			1
as in the case of @entity1 -- who won gold in the 4x100 - meter relay at the @entity16 -- @entity4 plans to appeal the decision made by @entity2 's anti-doping disciplinary panel to the @entity19			1
" this ruling is not only unfair , it is patently unjust , " the 31 - year - old @entity4 said in the statement			1
" panels such as these , i understood , were assembled to allow athletes who , consciously or unconsciously , come into conflict with the rules of sport , a chance at equitable redemption			0
" unfortunately , this was not the case			2
" @entity10 said tuesday that @entity1 , 29 , took a supplement which did n't list oxilofrine as an ingredient and @entity4 made the same defense			1
they are former training partners , the @entity38 newspaper reported			0
like @entity1 , @entity4 tested positive at last year 's @entity2 national championships and wo n't be allowed to return to competition until late december , with his ban backdated to last june			1
he could have been banned longer			2
" i took a legal supplement -- @entity44 , " @entity4 said			2
" as it turns out , that supplement was contaminated with oxilofrine			0
my team commissioned two private laboratories that confirmed that oxilofrine was present in the supplements , despite it not being listed as an ingredient on the bottle nor on it 's website			0
" i would also like to share that upon realizing that the supplement contained oxilofrine my team made contact with both the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) and the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) , who not only ordered samples of the supplement from the manufacturer , but also tested and confirmed our findings			0
" @entity4 held the world record in the 100 meters for three years prior to countryman @entity67 breaking it			1
besides once being the fastest man in the world , @entity4 teamed with @entity67 and two others to claim gold in the 4x100 - meter relay at the @entity74			1
he is also a two - time bronze medalist in the 100 meters at the world championships			1
it was the first time in nearly 12 years and more than 150 tests , @entity4 added , that one had an " adverse " finding			2
" it is for a stimulant ... a stimulant that is only banned during competition and experts have declared has no performance enhancing effects , " he said			2
" sanctions for a stimulant and this kind of infraction usually range from public warnings to a ban of three months , six months in the most extreme cases ; i was and am still more than prepared to accept a sanction that is in line with the offense			0
" instead nine months later what has been handed down is clearly not based on the offense nor the facts surrounding it			0
" i want to reiterate that i have never knowingly taken any banned substances , i did all the necessary checks before taking @entity44			0
" when contacted by @entity0 , @entity58 said it would review the reasons for thursday 's decision before deciding whether it would appeal .			0
