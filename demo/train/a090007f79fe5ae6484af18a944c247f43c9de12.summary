planning to travel in or to the @entity0 and wondering if the @entity0 government shutdown will hit your plans ? well , you may need to tweak some sight - seeing portions of your itinerary			1
never mind that visit to the @entity7 in @entity8			2
forget visiting @entity9 in @entity10			0
and that hiking adventure at @entity12 ? it wo n't happen			0
@entity16 , wrangling over spending and @entity15 , failed to renew government funds in time for the start of the new fiscal year on tuesday , and many travelers -- both domestic and international visitors -- will quickly start feeling the impact of the shutdown			0
while rail networks , essential air security and traffic control operations wo n't be impeded , travelers visiting the country 's national parks and other government - run tourist attractions will find the gates shuttered and the doors locked			1
all 401 @entity35 sites , which collectively average about 715,000 visitors per day in october , will be closed , according to a park service spokeswoman			1
( guests staying in campgrounds and on - site hotels will be given 48 hours to leave			0
) the @entity43 's 19 museums and galleries and the @entity45 will also turn visitors away			0
in addition to the @entity43 's @entity49 , the shutdown bars tourists from two of the world 's top destinations for aviation enthusiasts : the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 , and the @entity58 at @entity60 's @entity59			0
is it safe to fly ? airport security personnel are considered essential , so travelers please continue to follow @entity65 rules about liquids , shoes and other restrictions at the airport			2
air traffic controllers , some safety inspectors and other essential employees will " continue working in order to maintain the safety of the national airspace system , " said the @entity70 , in an e-mailed statement			1
" safety is our top priority			0
" most immigration , border and customs employees are also considered essential personnel , which means passport controls at @entity0 borders and points of entry like airports and cruise ports -- should be unaffected by the shutdown			1
other @entity70 projects , including facility security inspections , routine personnel security background investigations and development of the next generation of air traffic control technology , will be placed on hold			1
what if you 're waiting on a passport ? if you 're waiting on a @entity0 passport , how long that wait will last depends on where the passport agency is located			1
passport services , because they are funded by other revenue , are generally " unaffected by a government shutdown , " according to a @entity109 spokesperson			2
there 's just one possible catch : if the passport office is located within a government building that has been shut down , passport approvals may be affected			1
if you need a visa because consular services at @entity0 embassies and consulates around the world are largely funded by application fees , not annual appropriations , visa applications filed by foreigners wanting to enter the @entity0 will continue to be processed , according to the @entity109			1
