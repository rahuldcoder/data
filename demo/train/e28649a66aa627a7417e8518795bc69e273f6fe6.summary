@entity0 , a possible victim of game where teenagers appear to sucker - punch strangers , is encouraging people to think critically about how such attacks can be stopped			1
@entity0 was biking in the @entity7 area of @entity8 this month when she was struck			1
she had passed through a group of teenagers , she said , when one of them " reached out and punched me in the face			1
" " the whole group of kids laughed , " @entity0 told @entity17 's " @entity16 " on tuesday night			1
she was not seriously injured			0
though @entity0 had never heard of the " knockout game " before the november 15 attack , she may be a victim of it			1
and she 's not the only one			0
another woman was attacked in the same area one day earlier			1
she , too , sustained minor injuries and was not knocked out , according to @entity8 police			1
a police spokeswoman said authorities are investigating the two attacks as simple assaults			2
" the reason that i called the police was because my understanding of teenagers is they just do n't always think about the ramifications of their actions , how they can hurt people , how they can cause problems for the rest of their lives , " said @entity0 , who works on youth programs			2
she found fault with the popularity of so - called " knockout " videos			0
" instead of constantly replaying them on media , or on @entity51 , or whatever it is , you know i really feel like that 's just creating more of a culture of fear and polarization -- instead of actually spending time thinking about why it is that people are choosing to do this and how can it be stopped and prevented , " she said			0
authorities have reported similar incidents in @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1

authorities are working to determine whether she is a " knockout " victim , @entity68 said			0
despite the recent assaults , police in @entity64 say they have n't yet seen evidence of a trend , though they are not ruling out the idea			2
" the press has named it the so - called knockout game			0
we do n't discount that that exists			0
we 've investigated and will continue to investigate , " @entity68 told reporters tuesday			0
