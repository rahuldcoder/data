-- after years and years of over-the - top stories attesting to the character , honor , integrity and moral fiber of the late @entity8 head football coach @entity7 , we now know , after reading the 267 - page @entity8 internal report on child predator @entity10 , that @entity7 was nothing more than a narcissistic , arrogant coward			1
the report by former @entity15 director @entity14 details the shameful conduct of top officials at @entity8 , including @entity7 , who cared more about negative publicity than young boys being scarred for life			1
" the most powerful men at @entity8 failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who @entity10 victimized , " the report concluded			1
for 14 years they were silent and complicit in @entity10 's sexual abuse			1
for 14 years @entity7 , president @entity28 , athletic director @entity29 and vice president @entity30 could have picked up the phone to call the cops and tell what they knew about @entity10 sexually assaulting young boys			1
all they cared about was negative attention and how it might reflect on the program and the university			0
please , do n't bother with the petty justifications , rationalizations and calls to look forward instead of back			0
how can any man or woman , @entity8 alum or not , stomach even hearing @entity7 's name or seeing his face after reading how he played an integral role in covering up the vile and evil sexual misdeeds of his former defensive coordinator ? opinion : after @entity8 scandal , time to look at @entity55 @entity7 was treated like a saint in @entity57 ; in some quarters , he was a little " g " god			1
he was the man above reproach			0
he had more power than any other official on campus ; possibly in the state			0
he 's famous for saying he stayed in coaching because had he left , " it would leave college football in the hands of the @entity69 and @entity68 , " two coaches known for their winning ways , and for breaking @entity73 rules along the way			2
but @entity7 did n't break @entity73 rules in covering up for his buddy @entity10 , and allowing the coach a clear field to wreak havoc on the lives of numerous young men			1
what @entity7 did break was the moral code that every man and woman should abide by			0
@entity7 family 's statement on @entity14 report if @entity8 officials or @entity91 politicians had any guts , they would strip the university bare of anything adorned with the name @entity7			1
what his teams accomplished on the field is impressive , but no one can turn a blind eye to the failed leadership he exhibited off the field			0
and as the @entity102 detailed in a story saturday , @entity7 clearly sensed his reign coming to an end and decided to selfishly cash out			2
he lied repeatedly about his knowledge of @entity10 's sexual attacks , and did all he could to milk millions out of @entity8			1
i hope the families of the victims go after his estate for every penny and more			0
opinion : the end of @entity115 by leaving his name on buildings and his statue up , decades from now people will hail his work on the field and not think about the devastation he allowed to happen off the field			0
if sports fans nationwide could heap scorn on @entity128 and @entity129 for allegedly taking steroids , then a special place in sports hell should be reserved for @entity7			0
football is nothing more than a game			0
but @entity10 raping young boys is a matter of life and death , of innocence lost			1
in the aftermath of @entity10 's arrest , @entity7 was treated as a victim , a man who was caught up in something he was n't aware of			1
now we know that was a lie			0
@entity14 produced the documents showing @entity7 , his family and his legion of supporters lied in order to protect @entity7 's name			1
all he cared about was breaking the all - time record set by @entity156 head coach @entity155			2
@entity7 , and the other @entity8 lackeys , had to know that turning @entity10 in could prevent " @entity7 " from breaking that record			1
so they all stayed silent , and all the while young boys suffered in their own silence			1
when it 's time to name the great coaches of college football , @entity155 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 will certainly be mentioned			0
prior to the @entity14 report , @entity7 would have been on that list			2
but his actions in the @entity10 affair destroyed everything he accomplished in his career			0
great coaches make the tough calls			0
when @entity7 failed to make the toughest call of his life -- to the police to turn in his longtime friend -- he did more than cost his team a victory			2
young boys lost something they can never recover			2
that 's what cowards do , and @entity7 was a coward			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			0

@entity188 : @entity8 report reveals @entity7 as a coward
he says coach 's silence on @entity10 sex abuse to protect reputation makes him complicit
he says while @entity7 had eye on breaking coaching record , young boys were being raped
@entity188 : @entity8 should strip campus of *markers* of @entity7 's reign . he was a failed coach
