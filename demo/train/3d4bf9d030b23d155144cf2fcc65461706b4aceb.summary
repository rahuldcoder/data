" he said he would stay on through an upcoming government energy research summit at the end of february , adding : " i may stay beyond that time so that i can leave the department in the hands of the new secretary			1
" a statement by @entity10 thanked @entity3 for his " dedicated service , " saying he " brought to the @entity7 a unique understanding of both the urgent challenge presented by climate change and the tremendous opportunity that clean energy represents for our economy			1
" @entity3 " helped my administration move @entity55 towards real energy independence , " @entity10 's statement said , citing a doubling in renewable energy use , reductions in dependence on foreign oil and progress toward creating green energy jobs			1
