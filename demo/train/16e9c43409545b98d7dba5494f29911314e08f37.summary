@entity0 -- the @entity4 fertility doctor who implanted a dozen embryos in @entity6 , resulting in the birth of eight babies , will lose his medical license on july 1 , state officials said			1
the @entity10 ruled that dr. @entity11 committed " gross negligence " with " repeated negligent acts , for an excessive number of embryo transfers " into @entity12 in 2008			1
@entity12 -- known in the media as " @entity6 " -- was 33 when she gave birth to eight babies in january 2009			1
she was a single woman who already had six young children conceived through in - vitro fertilization administered by @entity11			0
@entity11 , who began treating @entity12 in 1997 , said @entity12 demanded all 12 embryos that were available for the procedure			1
the doctor " did not think he could refuse to transfer less embryos than those to which @entity6 would agree because he believe at the time that the ultimate decision should be largely driven by the patient 's wishes , " the board wrote in the decision released wednesday			2
" while the evidence did not establish ( @entity11 ) as a maverick or deviant physician , oblivious to standards of care in @entity40 practices , it certainly demonstrated that he did not exercise sound judgment in the transfer of 12 embryos to patient @entity43 ( @entity12 ) , " the board wrote			1
his lawyer argued during a hearing last october that @entity11 has been " a respected , excellent physician and surgeon for 25 years , " but that he " ran into sort of a perfect storm with one of his patients			0
" @entity11 was also found guilty of gross negligence in two other cases , including his treatment of a woman on her late 40s who became pregnant with quadruplets after he implanted seven embryos			1
her pregnancy was " rocked with complications , " according to the medical board			2
another case was a missed cancer diagnosis for a patient with an abnormal lab report			0
it was revealed during @entity11 's revocation hearing last october that @entity12 still has 29 frozen embryos in storage available for her use should she want more children			2
the complaint said the doctor should have referred @entity12 to a mental health physician after she repeatedly returned to him for treatments shortly after each of her pregnancies			0
@entity11 , an obstetrician / gynecologist in @entity81 , @entity4 , was expelled from the @entity82 in 2009 for what the fertility medical society called " a pattern of behavior that violated the group 's standards			0
" the society recommends implanting no more than two embryos for women under 35 and no more than five for women over 40 -- who have more trouble getting pregnant -- according to guidelines published on its website			0
giving birth to extreme multiples comes with tremendous risks for the mother and the babies , including " complications with pregnancy , prematurity and long - term consequences of that , " dr. @entity98 , an expert witness called by the medical board , testified			1
@entity12 's children -- six boys and two girls born nine weeks premature -- all went home after an extended stay in the hospital			0
while there has been no indication any problems have emerged , " we still do n't know , " @entity98 said .			0
