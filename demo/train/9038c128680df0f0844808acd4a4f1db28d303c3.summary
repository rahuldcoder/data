-- chaos and a lack of communication are common threads among @entity7 survivors ' stories of the @entity9 sinking , and making it to shore was only the beginning of a long ordeal for passengers trying to get home			1
@entity16 of @entity17 , @entity18 , boarded the ship about three hours before it ran aground friday night , killing at least 11 passengers			1
" all of a sudden , the boat leaned over like on a 70 - degree angle , and everything just started falling -- dishes were falling , trash cans were falling , everything was falling , " @entity16 told @entity0 affiliate @entity22			1
" then the lights went out and everything was blacked , out and then the lights came back on			1
" @entity32 of @entity33 , @entity34 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity21 that it was " like having the @entity35 without the water gushing through			1
" " i called my husband , not knowing if i 'd see him again , " she said			2
" i thought we were going to die			2
" there were no announcements for a long time , and @entity16 and her mother did n't see signs directing them toward lifeboats			2
" we were running around trying to ask what floor the lifeboats were on , and all the crew kept saying is , ' you do n't need them , you 're fine , everything is fine , we just got hit by a big wave , ' " @entity16 told @entity44			1
" all they kept saying was it 's a generator issue , just a generator issue and that the boat was floating along and just needed to get stabilized , " she said			2
@entity56 of @entity57 , @entity58 , said the crew tried to do what they could , " but when we asked them , they said they had no information			1
they just did n't have any information to give us			2
" @entity56 estimates the first announcement came 30 to 40 minutes after the ship ran aground			2
@entity16 and her mother feel lucky they found a lifeboat			2
" when our lifeboat dropped , it dropped			2
it was n't an easy letdown by any means , but at least we got into the water and were safe , which is a lot better than , unfortunately , some people , " she said			2
@entity82 staff in @entity56 's lifeboat were debating who would drive the boat , and they did n't seem to know what to do , she said			2
@entity88 of @entity89 , @entity58 , seconds that opinion , calling the crew " inexperienced and untrained			1
" in a letter to passengers , @entity82 ceo @entity92 disputes that assessment : " the crew of the @entity9 acted bravely and swiftly in an extremely difficult situation and succeeded -- despite the terribly demanding conditions -- in evacuating more than 4,000 people in the shortest possible time : we are proud of our commitment and dedication to your safety			1
" he goes on to outline crew training , safety procedures and regulatory oversight			1
survivors of the disaster say the scene on land was equally chaotic			2
@entity88 said the lifeboat ride to the @entity115 island of @entity116 was the last she saw of @entity82 employees until she , her husband and daughter reached a hotel in @entity121 on saturday			0
the people of the island came out in force to help the stranded travelers , and a local priest opened up the church			0
@entity88 and her family stayed at the home of a local family overnight			0
" the people of the island were wonderful , " @entity88 said			0
@entity56 and her husband wandered around on shore , finding a church , a local cafe and a small hotel all packed			0
" there was no organization			0
there was nobody , and the staff was in shock as much as we were			0
we saw @entity82 people ... walking around with a bullhorn , not using it , " @entity56 said			0
@entity88 and her family were herded onto a ferry to the mainland the morning after the wreck , " but we had no idea where we were going			0
" triage doctors , members of the coast guard , the @entity152 and other volunteer organizations met the cruise passengers and took them to a local school , where more local services were provided			1
her daughter received a pair of sneakers there because she was still wearing high heels from the night before , @entity88 said			0
the family then boarded a bus to @entity121 , where they were dropped off at a hotel			0
" the @entity169 had no idea we were coming			0
all these refugee boat people land on their front door , and they say , ' who are you ? but we 'll take care of you , ' " @entity88 said			0
there were two @entity82 cruise representatives at the hotel , " but every time we asked them if they could do something for us , they said they had no authority , " she said			0
the cruise line did pay for food , the hotel and their airfare home , @entity88 said , although they booked them on a flight to @entity194 , @entity195 , instead of @entity194 , @entity58 -- a mistake the family discovered in the @entity199 airport			1
" @entity200 , we were just ready to lose it at that point			0
" more than 1,100 @entity82 employees have been working to assist passengers and crew since friday night , @entity92 said in his letter to passengers			1
the ceo of @entity82 's parent company , @entity210 , pledged support to passengers : " i give my personal assurance that we will take care of each and every one of our guests , crew and their families affected by this tragic event , " @entity208 said in a statement			1
before @entity88 and her family could make the journey home , they needed new passports to replace those lost on the sinking ship			1
the @entity7 @entity228 's response was a big disappointment , @entity88 said			1
" other than getting our temporary passports , they gave us no assistance whatsoever			0
no food , no clothes , no money , no transportation			0
they told us to borrow some money , get a cab , come on down			0
" a hotel shuttle took @entity88 and other @entity7 to the embassy , she said			1
@entity245 spokeswoman @entity244 said the agency arranged with the cruise line to have @entity7 passengers transported to a @entity121 hotel and to the embassy for documents			1
more than 100 emergency passports have been issued to stranded travelers			0
" we also provided all kinds of advice , telephone contacts to families , helped families create travel funds , provided them with passport photos , warm clothes , there were even a couple of families that needed diapers , " she said during a @entity245 briefing wednesday			0
@entity88 and her family arrived home shortly after midnight tuesday			0
they received a voicemail from @entity82 saying the family would be reimbursed for the cruise and articles lost on the ship , she said , but the message did n't offer details of how those amounts would be determined			1
in addition to arranging lodging , transportation and counseling for passengers , @entity82 will address possessions lost on board and is in the process of refunding cruise fares and costs incurred while on board , the company said in a statement .			1
