-- he 's the face and voice of @entity4 's strategy against drug trafficking and organized crime			1
in his capacity as national security spokesman , @entity7 has the unenviable task of telling @entity11 -- and the world -- about his government 's fight against organized crime , which have been widely criticized			1
@entity0 's @entity16 asked @entity7 10 questions about the status of @entity4 's war on drugs			0
more than 34,000 people have died in drug - related violence during the four years that president @entity23 has been in power			1
based on your own estimates , last year was the worst with 15,273 deaths			2
is violence in @entity4 out of control ? the level of violence last year was the highest that we have had in a long time , but it is also the case that towards the end of the last year and the last trimester we saw a significant decrease in the number of deaths overall in @entity4			1
we have a comprehensive strategy and we have shown significant successes			2
we have seen an increase in violent incidents in places like @entity47 , which used to be safe			0
how widespread is violence in @entity4 ? violence is heavily concentrated			0
fifty percent of all deaths last year in @entity4 happened in only three out of 32 states in the country -- @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54			2
thirty percent occurred in the state of @entity52 and one of every five in @entity57 [ across the border from @entity59 , @entity60 ]			0
is it time to change @entity4 's anti-drug strategy ? we can get a hold of this violence			0
we have shown it in other parts of the country and we will do it because we have a comprehensive strategy to address crime and violence			2
can you mention a place where the current strategy is working ? in @entity76 we saw a very significant upsurge in violence during the year 2008			1
but thanks to a very strong presence of the federal forces , the increase in intelligence capabilities , and the very good coordination with state and local authorities , the level of violence has gone down , as well as kidnappings , car thefts , and extortion			2
@entity11 police are often overwhelmed by the drug cartels which often have more powerful weapons			1
what has your government done to strengthen police agencies ? we began the administration with less than 6,500 federal police officers			0
now we have over 35,000 with 7,000 of them having college degrees from the top universities in @entity4			0
these are all policemen that are vetted on a systematic basis			0
they can be excluded from the forces if they have any type of misconduct			2
three - thousand were dismissed last year for that reason			1
in what ways has the current strategy been effective ? in march 2009 , we announced that we were looking for 37 of the most wanted and dangerous criminals in @entity4 , the leaders of organizations which have grown significantly over time and have very significant logistical and organizational capabilities			1
to date , we have detained or brought down 20 out of this 37 criminals and that 's just one aspect of this strategy			2
we are significantly weakening these organizations			0
president @entity23 has said that the @entity124 demand for drugs fuels violence in @entity4			1
has this negatively affected the relationship ? we have a very significant and very fruitful and productive relationship , but indeed we have significant areas of opportunity			1
it is clear that the availability of high - powered guns in the @entity124 for @entity11 criminals is hurting bilateral security			1
we would hope to see an overwhelming response from the @entity124 government to prevent these guns from getting into @entity4			1
is it time for a @entity4 just as it was time for a @entity141 10 years ago ? we have the @entity4 and the most important part of it is that it recognizes our [ @entity4 and the @entity124 ] shared responsibility			1
it began during the @entity147 administration , at the urging of president @entity23			0
the @entity150 administration has supported it as well and agrees with the concept of shared responsibility			0
as we like to say , it takes two to tango			0
what do you say to @entity11 who are suffering the effects of violence ? we understand and share the feeling of frustration of people who live in certain areas of our country			1
president @entity23 has responded with a very significant and comprehensive strategy from the beginning of his administration			1
