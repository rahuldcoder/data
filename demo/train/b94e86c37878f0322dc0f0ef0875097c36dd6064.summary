-- before the @entity1 came the @entity2			0
when @entity4 succeeded his father @entity5 in 2000 , there was the promise of a modern and more democratic @entity7			1
in his inauguration speech , @entity4 indicated he would be a very different kind of leader to his father			1
" i shall try my very best to lead our country towards a future that fulfils the hopes and legitimate ambitions of our people , " he said			0
and for a while that promise was kept			0
his official website says he has built free - trade zones , licensed more private newspapers and private universities , and fought government waste and corruption			2
he has also worked on social and economic reform			0
but while there have been some changes during his rule , many say @entity4 's promises have largely not been delivered			1
@entity31 has called his time as president " the wasted decade " with a media that remains controlled by the state , a monitored and censored internet and prisons still filled with dissidents			0
two former regime insiders -- now its opponents -- recalled their time with the younger @entity4			1
former vice president @entity42 said @entity4 was often the victim of his elder brother 's cruelty			1
" his brother @entity45 bullied him as a child			0
his father never gave him as much attention as @entity45 , " @entity42 said			2
@entity50 's uncle @entity49 , who left @entity7 in 1984 after being involved in a failed coup , also recalled the future president			1
" he is very different than his father			2
@entity5 was a leader , the head of the entire regime , while @entity4 was never that close to being one and never fell within that framework			1
he is being perceived as the leader but he follows what the regime decides on his behalf			1
" @entity50 himself said reform faltered because of unrest in neighboring states , @entity64 and @entity65			1
he told the @entity66 last year : " there are many things that we wanted to do in 2005 we are planning to do in the year 2012 , seven years later			0
" but @entity42 , vice-president under both @entity4 and his father , says the younger @entity4 is both brutal and indecisive			1
" @entity4 's problem is that he listens to everything but denies and forgets quickly			1
you discuss an issue with him in the morning and another person comes along and changes his mind			0
" politically , @entity4 does not have a consistent ideology ; he changes his opinion according to his interests and that of the regime 's			1
" and the regime is a family affair			2
@entity50 's younger brother @entity84 commands an elite division of the army , and is accused of widespread human rights abuses			1
his cousin @entity88 is the richest man in @entity7			0
the @entity89 belong to @entity7 's @entity91 minority , who according to the president 's uncle @entity49 , are driven by fears they could be overwhelmed			2
" there is no doubt that the @entity91 are a minority who are in fear of the outcome and they are driven by that fear factor , " he said			0
despite the brutal crackdown over the last year in @entity7 , in which thousands have died , @entity4 maintains he is not in charge of @entity7 's military			1
he told @entity108 's @entity107 : " they are not my forces			2
they are forces for the government			0
i do n't own them			0
i do n't own the country			0
so they are not my forces			0
" would n't @entity4 , the commander in chief , have had to give the order for any military actions ? " no , no no , " he said			1
not by your command ? " no , " he said , " on no one 's command			0
there was no command to kill or to be brutal			0
" @entity50 said those members of the armed forces who " went too far " had been disciplined			2
but former vice-president @entity42 is in no doubt who does give the orders to kill : " @entity4 and no one else			1
he gives out orders to use all means of force to crush the revolution			0
he is surrounded by close aides and a security apparatus that advise him , but he decides			0
" it was n't expected that @entity4 would carry on the family 's political dynasty			1
he did n't seem to have the personality for the job ; he was n't deeply involved in military or government matters , according to " inheriting @entity7 : @entity4 's @entity143 , " a biography by @entity145 , who worked as an expert on @entity7 for the @entity147 in the 1990s and was the senior director for @entity150 affairs at the @entity151 in the early 2000s			1
because @entity4 's older brother @entity45 was expected to succeed his father , @entity4 went to @entity154 in the 1990s and studied ophthalmology , and headed the @entity156			1
" dr. @entity4 , " as he was widely known , liked to windsurf and play volleyball			2
he is believed to have started dating @entity159 - born @entity158 during this time			0
@entity4 was called back to @entity7 in 1994 when @entity45 died in a car wreck			2
this turn of events made him first in line to rule @entity7 , and he was appointed president by @entity7 's rubber - stamp @entity165 in 2000 after his father died			1
before 2000 ended , he and @entity158 were married			0
will @entity158 take a stand or stand by her man ? shortly after the @entity1 started in early 2011 , @entity4 made apparent moves toward change in @entity7			2
initially , protesters wanted basic reforms , more freedoms , a multiparty political system and an end to emergency law			0
some of these measures have , on paper , been implemented by @entity4 , but they were far too little and , by the time they came about , too late			2
after almost a year of violent protests , opposition supporters have lost any faith they ever had in @entity4 's ability to deliver reform , and simply want an end to his rule and true democratic elections			1
now @entity4 and members of his close - knit regime are digging in for what could be a long war of attrition			1
@entity0 's @entity193 contributed to this report .			0
