-- globalization washes like a flood over the world 's cultures and economies			0
floods can be destructive ; however , they can also bring blessings , as the annual floods of the @entity9 did for ancient @entity10			0
the world 's great universities can be crucial instruments in shaping , in a positive way , humankind 's reaction to globalization and the development of humankind itself			2
traditionally , universities have been defined and limited by location , creating an academic community and drawing students and scholars to that place			1
eventually , some universities began to encourage students to study elsewhere for a semester ; today most do			1
recently , some -- even those known for their cautiousness about innovation -- have developed " branch campuses , " or outposts at which graduate or undergraduate degrees are granted			1
the benefits of globalization are not evenly spread , but it is unalterably part of the landscape , and it is causing the world to miniaturize			0
the great question is how our institutions will respond to this global miniaturization			2
will it be out of fear , feverishly attempting to cabin off themselves , or with an eye on the opportunities , and the possibility of creating a new age of cultural and intellectual ecumenism			2
for universities , the latter should be a far more comfortable fit			2
this natural instinct of universities connects well with the emerging contours of economies in the " knowledge century " : that they will be driven by ideas and creativity , and that this world network of thought and innovation will be concentrated in a small set of global " idea capitals " among which the talented and creative will circulate			1
these idea capitals will be characterized not merely as centers of finance , insurance and real estate ( the fire sector ) , but also as centers of intellectual , cultural , and educational activity ( " @entity78 , " as i have called it elsewhere )			2
the world 's most enlightened leaders have accepted a crucial proposition : universities , especially research universities , will be principal incubators and drivers of the @entity78 sector			1
great universities attract and retain the creators , innovators , and entrepreneurs who propel thought , both producing and consuming intellectual , cultural and educational activities			1
how will universities shape themselves to meet this ? there will be many models -- some incremental , some bold			0
one new university model is already proving itself at @entity101 : the " global network university			1
" in opening @entity102 last week , @entity101 has created not only a new liberal arts university campus but a new university architecture			0
@entity102 is a second " portal campus , " along with our long - standing campus in @entity112 ; these are the anchors and basic hydraulics of a network that also knits together 12 other academic sites			0
the global network university allows faculty and students to move seamlessly through the network and around the world without separating themselves from the university 's intellectual community and resources			1
it is a veritable @entity122 strip of talent and thought			0
research labs continents apart can be connected , increasing their potency			0
faculty in one location can be made available to students in another			1
consider : a professor in @entity112 can offer a course featuring participation by students at several sites			0
the professor assigns team exercises , with students from many different sites working together			1
that interaction will be powerful in itself , but that need be only the start : we 'll likely see some or all of the students deciding to come together the following semester at one of the network sites			1
by uniting portal campuses and other academic sites , the global network creates an organic circulatory system that mirrors the flow of talent and creativity that increasingly defines the world			1
the result is more than an internationalized university with loose connections between a central location and branches around the globe ; instead , the talent and assets become fully available to enhance research and learning in every other part			2
in higher education , nothing is more powerful than a good idea			0
and this idea has resonated strongly			0
in the first class of undergraduates admitted to @entity102 , just 2.1 percent of applicants were admitted -- fewer than 200 of over 9,000 applicants			0
they hail from 39 countries , speak 43 different languages , with nearly 90 percent of them bilingual ; and have @entity175 scores at 75th percentile -- 770 for verbal and 780 for math. these scores match the most highly selective universities in the world			0
universities tend to be hidebound , but they will need to change			0
i do n't claim that the global network university will be the universal form for higher education 's future ; there are other ways to respond to academic globalization that will endure and make sense			1
but to thrive , universities will need to look very different from the way they do now , and they will have to find a form well - suited to the new reality of an ever - increasing flow of human capital and talent in the knowledge century			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2

@entity203 : traditionally , universities have been defined and limited by location
global campuses form a network of thought , innovation , he writes
faculty can teach , @entity203 says , students can team up in many *cities* at once
@entity203 : research , scholarship can be shared and cultural ties made in " century of knowledge "
