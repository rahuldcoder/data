@entity0 -- a former @entity3 captain who was dismissed under a federal law dealing with gays and lesbians in the military lost his appeal monday at the @entity10 @entity9			1
the @entity10 @entity9 refused to intervene in the challenge to the " do n't ask / do n't tell " law			1
@entity13 and 11 other veterans had sued the government over the " do n't ask / do n't tell " law passed in 1993			1
@entity13 was the only one who appealed to the high court , but the justices without comment refused to intervene			1
the provision forbids those in the military from openly acknowledging or revealing their homosexuality , and prevents the government from asking individual soldiers and sailors about their sexual orientation			0
the @entity30 administration had asked the high court not to take the case , and @entity33 officials had said they would not object to homosexuals being kicked out of the armed services			1
during the presidential campaign last year , president @entity30 said he supported throwing out the federal law but has taken no specific action on the controversy			1
the @entity40 said in a high court filing the law was " rationally related to the government 's legitimate interest in military discipline and cohesion			1
" a federal appeals court in @entity48 , @entity49 , had ruled against @entity13 , essentially ending his legal efforts			1
but a @entity52 , @entity53 - based federal appeals court ruled partially in favor of maj. @entity55 , allowing her lawsuit against the @entity57 to move ahead			2
those judges said the @entity59 must prove the dismissal of the flight nurse would ensure troop readiness and cohesion			0
justices say state judge should have recused himself in a separate ruling , the high court on monday found a state judge acted improperly when he refused to remove himself from a 2006 civil appeal despite having received financial support during his campaign from the ceo of the key defendant			1
chief justice @entity74 of the @entity75 cast the deciding vote in favor of that company			0
in a 5 - 4 ruling , the justices found that a perceived conflict of interest should have led to the judge 's recusal			2
" on these extreme facts the probability of actual bias rises to an unconstitutional level , " justice @entity85 wrote			0
the issue has become a touchstone of a growing political debate over whether judicial election races -- which have become more expensive and contentious in recent years -- erode public confidence in the legal system			0
the @entity97 case has attracted nationwide attention and was the basis for author @entity101 's 2008 best - seller , " @entity100			2
" the case now goes back to the state courts , where @entity74 likely will have to pull out of a rehearing			2
the @entity10 @entity9 issued a narrow ruling on the specific facts of the @entity97 dispute , but the implications are likely to be felt nationwide			1
thirty - nine states elect some or all of their judges			0
the facts of the case read like a legal thriller			2
businessman @entity113 , chairman of @entity114 , spent $ 3 million supporting @entity74 's 2004 run for the judicial seat -- accounting for 60 percent of the money spent in support of his campaign			0
@entity121 was involved in a decade - old business dispute with @entity123 , owner of rival @entity124			0
@entity123 accused @entity121 of unlawfully interfering with his business relations			0
a jury agreed , and in 2002 awarded @entity124 $ 50 million in compensatory and punitive damages			0
@entity121 waited four years to appeal			0
it was during those four years that @entity74 won his state high court seat			1
in april 2006 , @entity74 declined to recuse himself from @entity121 's appeal , which had reached his five - member court			2
@entity97 , like most state and federal courts , leaves to an individual judge 's discretion the decision to stay out of a case because of a potential conflict of interest .			0
