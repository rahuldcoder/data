@entity0 -- as voters headed to the polls on @entity4 , several of @entity7 's senior campaign aides said , they truly thought he was going to win the presidency and retake the @entity10 @entity9 lost four years earlier			1
" i was cautiously optimistic , " @entity7 pollster @entity11 said			2
instead , @entity12 garnered 51 % of the popular vote and 332 electoral votes to 206 and approximately 48 % of the popular vote for his opponent			2
@entity11 was one of the key @entity7 campaign officials who joined counterparts from @entity12 's campaign at a @entity21 symposium last week that examined the election , the strategies and how various factors influenced the outcome			1
reporting about the symposium , a post-election ritual dating back to 1972 , was embargoed until audio recordings of the forum were released to the public on monday			0
on @entity4 : @entity7 polling showed @entity12 lead in @entity34 on sunday during a session examining the general election , @entity7 aides said they believed their campaign had an intensity and enthusiasm advantage that would help spur voters to come out in larger numbers for @entity7 than the public polls were indicating			1
" we thought that we had the potential to tilt the partisan electorate a couple points in our direction , " @entity11 said			0
what the @entity9 did n't see was a massive and effective get - out - the vote operation by the president 's campaign , which increased its share of the @entity55 , @entity54 and youth vote over 2008 rates			2
as they heard the efficiency , breadth and depth of the @entity12 initiative described firsthand , @entity7 officials said their @entity12 counterparts deserved much credit both for the organization and for the results			1
@entity7 re-joins @entity67 's corporate board the general election panel , moderated by @entity1 chief political analyst @entity69 and @entity1 senior political analyst @entity70 , was just one part of the event sponsored by @entity21 's @entity73			1
besides the officials from the @entity7 and @entity12 campaigns , key personnel representing the @entity9 primary contenders as well as strategists for the major super pacs participated in various sessions looking at the election			1
full audio : @entity73 symposium looking back at some of their efforts , @entity7 aides said they realized they had work to do to try to increase their support among @entity88 -- especially in light of some of @entity7 's comments made during the @entity9 primary advocating self - deportation of illegal immigrants			1
@entity7 aides maintained they did not consider having the candidate apologize for those remarks when the general election came			1
" we shifted resources to try to improve our numbers with hispanics in @entity101			0
we did see some movement in @entity101 ... but we definitely had issues we inherited			0
we also did the same in @entity106 , " campaign manager @entity104 said			0
when asked about @entity7 's secretly recorded comments at a fundraiser where he said 47 % of the country would not vote for him because they are " dependent on government , " officials said they did not know it existed			1
immediately after it was released , campaign officials researched to see if there was any editing of the tape that changed what the candidate said			1
then aides had to go into damage control mode			0
analysis : why @entity7 lost @entity123 and others credited @entity7 for knowing he made a mistake and not blaming others			2
" i remember speaking to him and there was a lot of negativity about our campaign as a whole , but he 's a person who takes personal responsibility about it , " @entity104 said			2
" and he would tell me ... ' you did n't say 47 % , @entity138 ( @entity139 , @entity7 's senior campaign adviser ) did n't say 47 %			1
' and obviously it was not a high moment for our campaign , but i think it speaks a lot to who @entity7 is , and i also like to think it speaks a lot to who this campaign team is that we 're able to make a run and come back from that			1
" @entity104 discussed how the campaign was having problems in september after the @entity9 convention -- confronting stories of infighting -- but praised @entity7 , saying he never " pushed through and plowed through			1
" @entity7 aides they " never allowed ourselves to believe " they had no chance of winning			1
@entity12 aides said the roughest point of their campaign was the president 's performance in the first debate in @entity167			1
@entity168 , @entity12 's senior campaign adviser , told the panel that aides had purposely decided to avoid bringing up such issues as @entity7 's experience at @entity173 or the 47 % comments , but saw that strategy backfire			1
" we had a strategy of limited engagement that we took to an illogical extreme , " @entity168 said , a comment that was met by laughter from the attendees			0
" what we assumed was that these guys , having practiced for as long as and as hard as they had , had an answer prepared , and we just felt like we were going to lead into something that may not be productive , " he added			0
one key missed opportunity was when the @entity9 nominee said he had been in business for 25 years , did n't know about tax breaks for companies moving jobs overseas and that " i maybe need to get a new accountant			0
" " there were answers that we could have given			0
but it would have been more personal in nature , " @entity168 observed			0
" if there was a preparation problem , it was on that strategic level			0
" @entity12 engaged in more rigorous preparation for the second and third debates			2
one part of that was a focus on reaction shots , especially during the town hall forum where he would be on camera a lot			0
other interesting items to emerge : @entity101 , @entity101 , @entity101 : the @entity12 campaign had decided to wait until mid-september before deciding whether to fully commit financially to an ad campaign in @entity101			1
@entity215 saw some encouraging poll numbers that showed the state competitive after the @entity219 convention and dedicated $ 40 million			0
it was a " big moment , " campaign manager @entity221 said , because it was one of the states the @entity9 had to get back into their column in order to get the 270 electoral votes needed for election			0
the @entity173 attacks : @entity229 was aware that attacks on @entity7 's tenure at @entity173 had been used in @entity7 's previous runs for office in 1994 and 2002 , so the campaign in the fall of 2011 set up a task force headed by @entity237 , one of his closest friends and also a former @entity173 executive , to be ready to answer any charges			2
when the @entity242 super pac went up with @entity173 attacks in january during the @entity9 primaries , @entity104 said , the team had rebuttal information ready within 24 to 48 hours			0
while @entity104 said aides thought the attacks could come during the primaries , " we were surprised a little by the intensity			1
" mr. preparation : @entity250 , who directed @entity7 's debate preparation , said she wanted getting ready to debate the president to be the " @entity253 " of the campaign			1
the first general election debate prep came in june with policy sessions because officials knew this would be a good chance to give the campaign a jolt			2
there were policy and strategy sessions in june , july and august			0
@entity250 made sure @entity7 was armed with a research book for any cross-country trip			2
during the @entity219 convention in early september , @entity7 went to debate camp doing five mock debates in three days			2
and for " fun at night " the aides would do whiteboard review sessions			0
@entity7 did 16 mock debates in total because those close to him knew that one way to help him relax was to make sure he was as prepared as possible			0
@entity274 and @entity275 in political spotlight @entity1 's @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report .			0

@entity7 aides thought intensity and enthusiasm would tip the balance in their favor
campaign officials say they gave no thought to an apology for self - deportation comments
@entity12 advisers said the low point for his campaign was after his first debate performance
officials were speaking at a @entity21 *post-campaign* symposium
