-- join @entity1 for his weekly sound - off segment on @entity0 at 11:10 a.m. wednesday			1
if you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you			2
@entity1 says voting on tuesday made sense when the day was set in 1845 , but a change is needed			1
now that the political parties have informally settled on their nominees , the focus turns to november 4 , when the nation will go to the polls to choose a new president			2
but why is @entity14 on a tuesday ? why in the world do we continue to insist on voting on a weekday when we are supposed to be encouraging as many people to vote as possible ? most of the primaries and caucuses during the past four months took place on tuesdays , but a number went to the polls on saturdays			1
the @entity26 vote was on a sunday			2
what 's better than going to church in the morning and then making your way to the voting booth ? officially , @entity14 is the first tuesday after the first monday in november ( depending on the year , it could be november 2 through november 8 )			1
since 1845 , this has been the standard practice in the @entity34			0
@entity35 wanted a set date to elect a president and members of @entity35 , and because we were an agricultural society , this was the best day for farmers in rural @entity34 to get to the polls			1
that made a ton of sense			1
but a lot has changed in the past 163 years , and it 's time @entity35 changed this unnecessary law			1
the purists are likely to argue that everyone knows that a tuesday in early november is set aside for @entity14			1
so with that in mind , just leave the election in november			0
sure , it would make better sense to go with a month during which it 's warm in nearly all of the @entity34 , but the consistency argument also makes sense			1
but why not the first saturday in november ? if that date were chosen , the majority of voters would n't have to worry about trying to vote before going to work , hoping and praying the lines are n't too long so they can zip in and zip out			1
the same thing happens in the evening			0
folks have to hurry up and finish their work , interrupt meetings , and shut down whatever else they are doing and head to the polls			2
they are likely to confront long lines , and that discourages some folks from voting			2
( now , i do n't have much sympathy on this one			0
we 'll stand in line for a concert or movie ; and that surely is n't as important as electing a president ! ) saturday is already a day of leisure , and there is no doubt that more @entity34 would head to the polls on a traditional day off from work			1
because of the excitement generated by this year 's campaign , you can bet there will be long lines at the polls , and if there are not enough ballots , we can expect all kinds of delays			0
folks will grow frustrated , be afraid to show up to work late , and likely will leave and not come back			2
that 's just not good for democracy			0
this is one of those simple decisions that does n't require a ton of debate			0
i ca n't imagine there being major opposition to moving the election date			0
in 2004 , 71 percent of all eligible voters were registered , according to a story by the @entity111 , " @entity112 : lessons from 2004			0
" but of that number , 60.7 percent voted			0
someone is likely to say that with the number of people voting up in 2004 from the number in 2000 , that 's not bad			1
but when we see 90 percent of voters in @entity123 voting -- and we are trying to instill democracy there ! -- it 's clear that impediments to voting in the @entity34 are n't helpful			2
it would be nice to see the presidential nominees weigh in on this and pledge to change the election date			0
let 's see a debate moderator ask this question			0
instead of putting up barriers for people who want to vote , we should be the most open society when it comes to giving our citizens as many options as possible to vote , and moving @entity14 from a weekday to a weekend makes a lot of sense			1
we ca n't speak of our cherished democracy around the world if we are n't willing to improve it every chance we get			0

@entity1 says @entity14 should be changed to the weekend
weekday voting once made sense , but no longer , @entity1 says
goal should be to make it easy for as many people to vote as possible , he says
next president should work with @entity35 to make the switch , he says
