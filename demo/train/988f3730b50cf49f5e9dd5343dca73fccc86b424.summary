last year , voters in @entity1 approved legalizing recreational marijuana , and on tuesday night , they resoundingly supported taxing it			1
with nearly all votes counted , 65 % supported the new tax , while 35 % opposed it			2
the measure would impose a special 15 % excise tax on marijuana to help fund school construction , along with a 10 % sales tax to bolster marijuana - related law enforcement efforts			2
the passage was widely expected , despite opponents arguing it 's unfair to single out marijuana for higher taxation than products such as beer			1
strong support for the measure is pegged largely to the money it is expected to bring in			0
the nonpartisan @entity1 @entity23 projects that the measure will generate nearly $ 70 million in additional state tax revenue next year			1
there were 30 other measures on the ballot in six states tuesday , all of which were too early to call for @entity32			1
here are highlights from a few : @entity1 : secession voters in 11 counties in northern @entity1 are being asked if they want to secede from the state			1
ten counties in conservative , rural northeastern @entity1 would theoretically form a 51st state known as @entity1			1
@entity41 , located in the northwest corner of the state , would become a panhandle for neighboring @entity45			2
the plan has no chance of becoming reality			0
among other things , it would also require statewide and congressional approval			0
but approval or even a close vote at the county level would send a loud message of growing grassroots conservative anger toward a more liberal @entity60 - based @entity59 establishment that has taken up controversial measures related to gun control , gay rights and green energy			2
with more than 50,000 votes counted in @entity67 , the most populated county of those trying to secede , 58 % of votes were against secession and 42 % were in favor of it			0
@entity32 , however , does not yet have a projection on this measure			0
similar secession measures have been floated in a number of other states in recent years in a reflection of the country 's growing ideological and partisan divide			1
@entity80 : labeling genetically modified food voters in @entity80 are considering a hotly contested initiative that would require labeling all foods containing genetically modified ingredients			0
the measure pits local consumer advocates , who argue that the measure is needed for consumers to make better informed choices , against large agribusinesses such as @entity93 , which argue that such a law would spook potential customers and unfairly imply that such products are unsafe			0
@entity80 is the second state to consider such a ballot measure			1
a similar proposal was narrowly rejected by @entity100 voters last year			0
with more than 800,000 votes counted , 53 % of @entity80 voters opposed the labeling , while 47 % supported it			2
it is still , however , too early for @entity32 to call this race			0
according to the nonpartisan @entity107 , 95 bills relating to the issue have been introduced in various legislatures so far this year -- a reflection of growing public interest in the controversy surrounding genetically modified foods			0
other noteworthy measures voters in @entity115 are considering whether to amend their constitution to raise the state minimum wage from the federal level of $ 7.25 to $ 8.25 per hour			1
future annual increases would be tied to changes in the cost of living			0
eighteen states have a minimum wage that exceeds the federal requirement , according to the @entity107			1
@entity126 voters are being asked to revise their constitution to allow the legislature in @entity128 to authorize seven casinos , with the goal of generating new revenue for public schools and potentially cutting property taxes .			2

voters in 6 states will consider *31* ballot measures tuesday
voters in 11 @entity1 counties are considering the *question* of secession
