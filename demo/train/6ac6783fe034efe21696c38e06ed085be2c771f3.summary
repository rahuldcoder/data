-- with an acting career that spans three decades , @entity1 is right at home in front of the camera			1
but with the new @entity8 reality show " @entity9 " premiering at 9 et tuesday night , the 50 - year - old actor is going behind the lens as an executive producer			1
with " @entity9 , " @entity1 is training the spotlight on the @entity15 - based @entity14 family , a @entity16 clan that 's balancing holding on to its traditions while pursuing the @entity20 , he said			1
" @entity9 " was a bit like chasing a dream for @entity1 , who said that the show 's development took nearly five years as he bounced the concept around various networks			1
" you want to surrender and give up so many times , but it adds validity to the fact that if you never give up you have the chance of finally making it , " he said			2
@entity1 spoke with @entity0 about the new show , what he 's learned as an executive producer and why he is n't a big fan of reality tv			1
@entity0 : what was the impetus to develop a show around this family ? @entity1 : ( the son of ) a friend of mine and his film student partner , they were making a documentary on the @entity14 family			1
i saw some footage , and i was just immediately fascinated by this subculture that exists right in my city , right in @entity15			1
the characters and personalities were just popping off the screen , and i said this story needs to be told ; this family could make entertaining television			1
i brought it to @entity60 , who i was involved with developing something for @entity63 at the time , and it felt like the right match			2
from there , we shaped a trailer and started pitching to a bunch of networks			0
... at the end of the day , after years of time , @entity8 stepped up and said , " we 'll give you nine or 10 episodes on the air			1
" @entity0 : what can viewers expect to see ? @entity1 : over the first season they 'll see the growth within the family as far as finding the balance between ( having ) one foot in the @entity20 side and the other rooted in the @entity16 age - old traditions			1
... there 'll be no shortage of the @entity16 court hearings and the conflicts and the psychic shop dilemmas			1
there 's a lot of stuff going on , but the human elements are what i 'm hoping will make this a long run rather than a flash - in - the - pan idea			0
@entity0 : what were the hurdles you were coming across when you were working to get this show to production ? @entity1 : it 's an unorthodox , for lack of a better description , lifestyle			1
i use the word subculture because it is that			0
i think once you pitch it up a ladder of the network , and it gets to the corporate end , there 's some who might frown upon taking a peek inside this world where there are arranged marriages , the kids are homeschooled , some of them do n't know how to read -- which is an element of our first episode			0
this is one family that i just think is fascinating , and the characters are intriguing			2
family comes first for them , and that 's relatable to me			2
@entity0 : did you know anything about this culture before you watched that footage ? @entity1 : no , and that 's what was fascinating			1
a lot of the footage was about a wedding and also the whole psychic world			0
you 're either a skeptic or a believer , and i fall way on the skeptic side , big time			0
but they claim they have a gift			0
it is an odd business , and not one that i would wholeheartedly invest in and embrace , but it 's a belief			0
to me , it 's just peeling back the curtain a little bit on this one unique family and what their culture is , whether you agree with it or not			1
the stereotypes ( about this culture ) are so negative			2
so i think the @entity163 want to be recognized as a minority group and not those stereotypes			0
@entity0 : why 'd you use @entity16 in the title , and how ( did ) the @entity168 feel about it ? @entity1 : why is n't it called @entity171 ? that 's a marketing thing			1
... people understand that more than they understand @entity16			1
i think the @entity175 understand			0
throughout the show , they speak of that and sort of educate about the misnomers of the " @entity16 " slang , but they get that 's going to bring people to the table			1
@entity0 : did you have any concerns about misrepresenting this group ? representing an ethnic group in a reality show can get dicey			2
@entity1 : i agree with you			1
i have members of my family and friends who are from the old school who would never watch " @entity194 " or " @entity195			2
" now , " @entity195 " is a show that was cast ; they went out and looked for those characters			2
but the @entity14 family is the @entity14 family ; we did not cast them			2
this is not indicative of all @entity16 families nor do i endorse some of their choices			1
the traditions , the elder @entity16 court , the psychic businesses -- that 's not made up , that 's part of the culture			1
but how they react , their personalities , how they deal with conflict -- that 's the @entity14 family , not necessarily every family			2
@entity0 : this is your first time as an executive producer for a reality program -- what were the biggest lessons you learned ? @entity1 : ( @entity223 ) i 'm still learning them			1
but the lesson i 'm learning , once you get into tv , because the goal is to make sure they do n't reach for the remote in a minute and a half , stuff is cut for drama and sometimes it 's cut for train wreck , which is my least favorite form of entertainment			0
it 's trying to stay true to story and character and integrity and still getting your audience to come to the table and having to deal with the buyers at the networks who control the end result of what comes on the air			0
that you struggle with in any form of it -- there 's that old corny phrase , it ai n't show art , it 's show business			2
hopefully , at the end of the day the human elements of the @entity14 family is what makes the show last			1
the bells and whistles are short - lived i think			0
having both makes it exciting and entertaining			0
@entity0 : did you watch any reality tv to prep for this ? @entity1 : i am not a reality tv fan for the most part			1
i 'm an actor who wants more opportunities to act , so reality programming drains the marketplace for opportunities			2
but it 's like great news programming -- real is more fascinating than fiction if you can invest and connect with the characters and the stories , so i see the worth in it			0
i did relent to do " @entity281 " after passing on it twice , and it turned out to be a fantastic thing for me			0
i do n't run to it , but i get the appeal for sure			0
i just came off from the acting side			0
i just finished a film called " @entity287 " with @entity288 and @entity289 and @entity290			0
i 'm really excited about that			0
@entity0 : tell me more about that			0
@entity1 : i play the screenwriter of " @entity294 " -- the film is about @entity287 's mindset during the making of that film and what was going on in his life			1
it 's very smart , humorous and heartfelt			0
i 'm also recurring as @entity303 's latest love interest on " @entity304			0
" i go back in october to shoot some more			2
we 'll see how long that goes before they find out this is n't the right guy for her because you know what happens with couples on a sitcom			0
so i 've been busy .			0
