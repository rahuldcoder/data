-- the port - city of @entity2 , on @entity4 's west coast , is n't known for its arts scene			1
nestled amid @entity9 's famously stunning backwaters ( travel writers have long loved touting the streams that snake through the rural countryside as the quintessential bucket - list endeavor ) , the city is more readily defined by its breathtaking backdrop			1
from today and for the next three months , that will change , as the world 's culture vultures descend into @entity2 to attend one of @entity4 's first international arts festivals : the @entity19			1
even since @entity21 introduced the world to the biennale in 1895 , the word has been symbolic of a city 's cultural ascendency			1
often , biennales demonstrate a region 's savvy through showcasing the direction the contemporary arts scene will go in coming seasons			1
@entity2 has something a little different planned			1
rather than focusing on the future , this biennale 's theme centres very much on @entity2 's history			1
in particular , it will put a spotlight on @entity39 , @entity4 's answer to @entity41			1
@entity39 was a prosperous trading hub that from the first century @entity43 that supplied the world with everything from spices to precious stones			0
the city drew traders from as far as @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			2
it was active up until the 14th century , when it mysteriously disappeared under the sea -- perhaps by a flood or tsunami			0
excavations just outside @entity2 a few years ago unearthed pottery , coins and various other artefacts that link the region to the @entity64 era , and suggest that , at last , @entity39 has been found			2
the biennale founders have adopted the fallen port as a theme for the event , and in previous months , a legion of local and international artists have picked over the city for inspiration for their projects			1
many pieces will involve found art. @entity75 , a @entity9 - born sculptor , is designing a piece with abandoned anchors , while @entity79 , @entity4 's leading installation artist , is creating a 400 square - foot reconstruction of @entity39 using terracotta shards unearthed at the excavation site			1
he will both physically throw water on the installation , and incorporate video of flowing water , to represent the destruction of the city			2
" it 's about a certain fragility of this quiet , thriving port town , of which little is actually known , " he says			2
the hope is that they 'll draw attention not only to @entity9 's artistic heritage , but to its historic one as well			2
in many ways , @entity2 makes a lot of sense as the destination for the country 's first biennale			1
@entity9 seems to have birthed a large proportion of artists over the years , including @entity103 , considered by many the father of @entity4 abstract painting , and @entity106 , one of the first @entity4 artists to gain notoriety outside the subcontinent			1
" just why @entity9 produces so many artists seems to be a very popular question , " notes @entity110 , co-founder of the @entity111 © , the city 's first gallery			1
" it 's most likely due to a combination of a high standard of living , the political climate , tolerance for opposing ideology , and a long history of foreign visitors			0
" @entity124 , one of the organisers for the festival , also gives credit to @entity9 's political climate			2
" there 's a long tradition of activism here , and there 's always been a very vocal dialogue between political parties			0
for artists , the most important thing is that they have the capacity to be argumentative			0
" one of the participants , ubik , is a @entity9 - born artist who has since relocated to @entity140			0
on a recent research trip to the area , he discovered the extent that politics has shaped his paintings			0
" growing up , i 'd always see communist propaganda messages all over the walls			0
it 's an aspect that 's seeped into my work , and strangely enough , it only now kind of makes sense to me			0
i do a lot of text - based paintings , and i was always quite curious about where that came from			0
" see also : evolution of the @entity158 art market like many artists that hail from the region , @entity159 has n't stayed put			0
he notes that one reason @entity9 's artists seem to flock to other countries is a lack of museums and galleries			2
" most of the art market is focused on [ @entity172 ] and @entity173			0
that 's just where it is , commercially speaking			0
from what i know , i do n't think @entity9 really has the infrastructure for that , " he notes			0
lacking traditional arts spaces , the organisers have done something quite unique ; they 've commissioned heritage houses throughout the area to host the work , including an old @entity188 dockyard , a former 17th century military bungalow used by the @entity190 and a 19th century @entity193 gentleman 's club			1
@entity124 is also hoping that the biennale will bring the necessary infrastructure for a budding @entity197 arts scene			0
" we 're building an architecture where a biennale can grow , " he explains			0
" traditionally , @entity4 has failed to take on projects like this			2
hopefully , the @entity19 will change people 's minds , and they 'll start to have philanthropic ideas , and to invest in arts and culture for the next generation			1

the @entity4 city of @entity2 will host @entity4 's first ever international arts festival
the @entity19 will run for three months and display works by @entity4 and international artists
lacking traditional arts spaces , the organizers have commissioned heritage houses throughout @entity2 to host the festival
