-- president @entity1 named solicitor general @entity2 as his nominee to replace retiring justice @entity4 on the @entity5			1
@entity0 asked legal experts and commentators the significance of @entity1 's selection , what to expect from @entity2 as a @entity5 justice and what lies ahead in the confirmation hearings			1
@entity14 , a partner at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity16 , who co-chairs its @entity5 practice			1
she has practiced extensively before the @entity5 , where she has briefed approximately 70 cases and argued 28 cases			1
she spent 11 years appearing before the court as an assistant solicitor general during the @entity24 and @entity25 administrations : while many have said that president @entity1 's replacement of @entity4 will not affect the direction of the court , it must be remembered that @entity5 nominations are long - term investments for a president			1
in that regard , @entity2 is an excellent investment			1
if she follows her predecessor 's lead , she will spend four decades serving the nation on the court			0
while i agree that her arrival is unlikely to shift the court 's jurisprudence significantly in the short term , she will likely remain on the court long after some of its leading conservative justices have retired			0
her brilliant intellect , affable personality , persuasiveness in oral and written advocacy and proven ability to build bridges and develop common ground among very independent thinkers ( such as @entity58 faculty ) will make her a true judicial leader on the court and will ultimately have a weighty influence on the development of the law throughout her tenure			0
even in the short term , her powerful reasoning and consensus - building will likely influence the outcome of some cases			0
remember that 90 percent of the court 's decisions are workaday rulings that do not capture headlines , yet that is the field in which the justices ' inter-relationships and patterns of dialogue are forged			0
finally , like all of the female justices who have preceded her on the court , @entity2 has impeccable qualifications and ability			1
i sincerely hope that , with her appointment as the court 's third sitting female justice and fourth in history , we will find ourselves coming to the point where the female gender of a nominee is no longer a novelty			0
it is past - due time for the appointment of women on the court to be accepted as a commonplace			0
@entity99 , professor of history and public affairs at @entity103 's @entity102 in @entity104 : with a year under his belt , we can now say that @entity2 is a quintessential @entity108 pick			1
foremost , she has impeccable academic credentials ; @entity1 likes to fill positions with the best and the brightest			1
when she appears before the @entity113 , her knowledge of the law will be impressive and can put senators on the defensive			0
furthermore , her positions are difficult to characterize politically			0
like @entity1 , she is somewhat elusive			1
@entity2 has enough on her record , such as supporting certain expansions of executive power , to concern the left and enough on her record , such as her position on military recruitment on campuses , to anger the right			1
this will make her more difficult for @entity127 to target effectively during the confirmation hearings			0
@entity129 , senior fellow in constitutional studies and editor - in - chief of the @entity132 at the @entity133 , a libertarian - leaning think tank in @entity16 : @entity2 is not the worst choice , but other short - listers would have been better in various ways			1
while any @entity1 nominee would have similar views on hot - button issues like abortion and gay rights , @entity138 would have been great on antitrust and complex commercial litigation , for example , and @entity147 would bring a stronger understanding of administrative law			1
generally , there is no indication that the solicitor general is anything but a standard modern liberal , with all the unfortunate views on the scope of federal power that that entails			1
another concern is her mediocre performance in her current position			0
i question the choice of arguments she made in @entity166 and @entity167 , for example -- in the first case abandoning the court 's rationale in the precedent she was defending , in the second asserting that protection for speech varies inversely on the speech 's social value			2
but she may be better suited to a judicial rather than advocacy role			0
with @entity181 holding a large @entity113 majority , @entity2 's confirmation is in little doubt			1
more interesting will be the debate over constitutional limits on government			0
@entity188 is a law professor at @entity189 in @entity190 , where he is the founding director of the @entity191			0
he is @entity192 and blogs at @entity194 / / / we know a lot about @entity2 's biography and background			2
she was an academic , the first woman dean of @entity58 , worked for president @entity24 , and is the current solicitor general			1
but we know very little about her views			0
with the exception of some strong comments about military recruitment at @entity58 , she has not expressed or taken any positions on the significant public policy issues of the day			0
she has not developed or communicated any ideas about the role of the @entity5 in a democratic society			2
she has not been at the forefront of legal thinking on any difficult constitutional matter			0
indeed , the fact that we know so little about her views is apparently one her qualifying characteristics			0
her nomination thus sends a very clear message to aspirants to the @entity5 : if someday you wish to be nominated to the @entity5 , say nothing of substance			1
we have created a process by which our most thoughtful leaders , individuals such as @entity58 's @entity223 , @entity225 's founding dean @entity224 , @entity227 's @entity226 , @entity229 's @entity228 and so many others , would be deemed unqualified for the court simply because they have dared to substantively and courageously engage the issues of their time			0
would @entity234 or @entity235 be nominated under this current framework ? one wonders whether a game that promotes politics over principle is worth the candle			2
@entity241 , a former law clerk to @entity5 justice @entity242 , is president of the @entity243 in @entity16 , a nonprofit organization that describes itself as an " institute dedicated to applying the @entity247 moral tradition to critical issues of public policy			2
" he served during president @entity25 's first term as principal deputy assistant attorney general for the @entity252 in the @entity254 @entity253 : president @entity1 claimed he was searching for a @entity5 justice who would protect the concerns of @entity254 citizens			1
by that standard , @entity2 is a very strange pick			2
while @entity254 soldiers were fighting @entity263 terrorists abroad and defending our national security , @entity2 kicked military recruiters off the @entity58 campus			2
in doing so , she elevated her own ideology above what @entity269 , acting on the advice of military leaders , had determined best served the interests of national security			0
@entity2 has no judicial experience , hardly any real - world legal experience and a scant record of legal scholarship			2
she 's been adept at cultivating the powerful , as her paid role as a @entity281 adviser shows			0
her primary advantages over the other contenders for the nomination were that she 's an @entity1 insider and that she 's largely succeeded in hiding her legal views			1
her nomination deserves rigorous scrutiny			2
@entity288 , faculty director and professor of law at @entity290 in @entity291 , @entity292 : the nomination of solicitor general @entity2 for the @entity5 reflects president @entity1 's characteristic preference for caution and conciliation rather than political confrontation in dealings with @entity269			1
first , the president is calculating that it will be difficult for the same senators who voted recently to confirm @entity2 as solicitor general to decide that she should not be confirmed as an associate justice on the @entity5			1
second , even though she does not have judicial experience like every other sitting member of the court -- and while if confirmed , she would become only the fourth woman to serve on the court -- in educational background and her work as a law professor and presidential appointee , @entity2 's experience will not add diversity to the court			2
third , her views of presidential power ( expressed in her writings and particularly in the path that the @entity1 administration has pursued on the @entity322 detainees and on trials for those suspected of ties to terrorist organizations ) would not seem to cause concerns among senators on national security grounds			2
as solicitor general , however , @entity2 recently declined to pursue an appeal in @entity332 v. @entity254 , the case in which the @entity334 upheld a damages award of more than $ 100 million to four men who spent decades in prison because the @entity339 framed them for a murder they did not commit			1
two of the men died in prison			0
@entity2 's decision indicates not only a careful review of the law , but the implicit judgment that the government can not use any and all means in pursuit of its law enforcement objectives , especially when those means involve a deliberate disregard for the rights of innocent individuals			2
