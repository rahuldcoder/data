-- we 're in a time of flux , my friends			1
we 're sandwiched somewhere between the lazy , crazy days of summer ( @entity5 ! @entity6 trips up the coast ! smuggling fireworks across various and sundry borders ! ) and the holidays ( turkey ! ceremonies of various religious ilks ! self - loathing brought on by turkey and ceremonies of various religious ilks ! )			2
and we do n't know about you , but we 're about due for a mental break before sallying forth into the mental torment that is winter			2
that 's why this week we 're going to chill with the pedantry and help you kick back and celebrate laziness			1
it 's the total antithesis of the " @entity27 " ( whatever the hell that is )			2
read on for five apps that are either tailored for the more malaise - laden among us			0
waking up is hard to do especially when the floor temperature starts dropping for 10 degrees with each passing week			0
may we introduce @entity34 , a genius @entity41 app that lets you pledge 25 cents to a variety of charities each and every time you decide that you need another 10 minutes or so of sleep ( either to catch up on rest or finish that sexy dream )			1
if your boss chews you out for being late to work , just tell him you were volunteering			0
do n't have time to comb through @entity47 fool your music snob friends with @entity49 , an @entity51 app that dishes out musical knowledge in easy - to - digest screen - fulls			1
each day , you 'll get a bevy of info on one hand - selected band : original interviews , streaming music , videos and more			0
if your friends still doubt your expertise , just cast about your brain for the name of some buzz band and express disdain			1
your get - up - and - go got up and went the days are getting shorter , and , consequently , the nights are getting longer -- and damn colder			0
if the prospect of staying in and watching reruns of ' 90s teen television whilst swaddled in a @entity71 is seeming more appealing than pouring yourself into something fancy and hitting the streets , might we recommend buying a cat and just giving up ? maybe just check out @entity76 , an @entity41 app that lets you trade cash for pics of the scene at local bars and restaurants -- thus checking out the crowd without leaving your couch			1
other users collect the money you pony up to supply said photos			0
or , you know , you could get off your lazy , sweatpants - encased arse and collect cash for your own snaps			1
getting paid to go out ? dude , that 's like being an escort -- without all the illegal stuff			0
two heads are better than one ok , so you 're not a total recluse , but the idea of sacrificing two nights out this week ( one for dating , one for hanging with friends ) is making your brain weary -- all that planning , all the strain that semi-intelligent conversation entails			1
check out @entity105 , a new dating site that allows you to go on double dates with your friends			1
also , if you 're not that loyal a friend , it 's like two dates in one night -- score			2
running on empty some people look forward to their morning runs			0
some of us , however , could n't impel ourselves to jog if our lives depended on it			0
in the unlikely event that a horde of flesh - eating undead were ( literally ) nipping at our heels , we 'd likely strap on some nikes and jet			0
enter zombies , @entity127 ! an upcoming app for @entity41 and @entity129 that turns exercise into a game -- a terrifying , terrifying game			1
basically , you download the app , stick in your ear buds and let a narrator scare you into getting in shape as the story of a dystopian world crawling with z - beasts starts to unfold			2
the more you run , the better chance you have for survival as you collect supplies and just generally avoid being eaten			0
this app should be stellar training for throwing yourself into the mortal morass that is holiday shopping .			2
