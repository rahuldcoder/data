@entity0 , @entity1 -- the sun is warm			0
and the mood is as bright as the midday sky			0
it 's spring training season , a time when hopes remain high across baseball - loving @entity10			1
here in @entity15 territory , the fans of 15 different baseball teams have descended once again on greater @entity16 — an area so dense with ballparks that even " away " games are often less than an hour away			1
there are hot dogs and hot tamales , shopping malls and swimming pools , mountaintops and margaritas — a full roster of reasons to hop on an @entity1 - bound plane			1
every year for six weeks or so , you ca n't swing a bat here without hitting a baseball fan			1
by the hundreds of thousands , they return each spring to cheer on the @entity36 or the @entity37 or the @entity38			1
still , none of those fans may be as loyal and long - suffering as those of the @entity42			1
for decades , they have gravitated to @entity0 and luxuriated in the preseason oasis that is spring training — a shimmering sliver of optimism that may , once again , prove to be a mirage			2
but who needs to think about that now ? who needs to be reminded that last year the @entity42 had their worst record since 1966 ? and , ok , that they have n't won a @entity53 since 1908 ? a non-fan 's spring training pilgrimage an authentic ballpark feel today , we are months away from the chilly realities of october			1
today , as the first sunburn of the season settles across our skin , we are warmed and relaxed and oblivious to the sting that may follow			0
perhaps the " @entity65 " in a @entity42 fan 's dna stands for denial -- or determination			1
because no matter how badly the team plays ( and please feel free to insert your own joke here ) , they still manage to break attendance records season after season			0
the turnout defies logic , yet it 's a force of nature that can not be denied			0
it 's an annual phenomenon that starts here in @entity0 , which has served as the preseason headquarters of the @entity42 for six decades			1
their home base is @entity83 , which seats 12,500 baseball traditionalists who enjoy its easy accessibility and authentic ballpark feel			2
" the @entity42 are really woven into the fabric here in @entity0 , " says @entity88 , @entity0 's director of communications			1
" they 've been training here since 1952 , so generations of @entity0 residents have grown up watching and following this team			0
" " so many @entity97 are either transplants who have relocated here or folks who have purchased vacation homes here , " she added			0
" it 's a rite of passage to come and cheer for the home team			2
" @entity10 's 11 new sandwich heroes a new park in @entity108 next year , the @entity42 will move into a new spring training complex under construction in @entity0 's @entity111 , just a few miles from @entity83 in an area that 's already being called @entity113 , in homage to the @entity42 ' storied @entity115			1
surrounded by shops and restaurants , the new stadium will hold 15,000 and sit in a larger park that includes paths , playgrounds , practice fields and a public lake			0
" we fought long and hard to stop the @entity42 from going anywhere , " @entity88 says			1
" we have a long friendship and kinship with them , and they are now locked in for the next 30 years			2
and the new stadium will be spectacular			0
" what wo n't change with the new location are the intangibles that help define the spring training season : the near - perfect weather , the camaraderie , the sense of tradition mixed with new beginnings			1
hours before the game begins , tailgating @entity97 have already set up shop in the @entity83 parking lot , where they are grilling bratwursts and launching another round of beanbag toss			2
others survey the @entity42 merchandise at a roadside t - shirt stand that 's fanned by palm fronds swaying in the breeze			1
still others settle with their blankets and babies on the berm , the grassy sloping outfield that feels a bit more family - friendly than @entity115 's rowdy bleachers			2
there are dusty - purple mountains on the horizon			2
there are players signing autographs within easy reach — not just the less - familiar hopefuls but marquee major - leaguers like @entity167 , who 's stooping and smiling for a photo with a little girl			2
and somewhere in the distance , there is " @entity172 , @entity173 " playing on the @entity174 long road to umpiring in the majors ' 10 inches of snow back home ' @entity180 of @entity181 , @entity182 , has made a spring pilgrimage to @entity83 every year since 2004			1

she also owns a bucket hat covered with autographs she 's collected in @entity0			0
" it 's fantastic here , " she says , as she browses the souvenir shop in search of even more @entity42 gear			1
" it 's a lot cheaper than the games at @entity115			0
plus , there are ten inches of snow back home , and here i am in shorts			0
" @entity173 - born @entity206 " just got lucky " when he landed a job in @entity208 , where he enjoys being part of the large @entity173 expat community			2
his proximity to @entity42 spring training has made him " more popular " than he was back home , he jokes , especially because it comes with temperatures in the 70s and inexpensive tickets to the game			1
inside the low - slung stadium , it 's easy to feel close to the action			2
the best seats in the house — those in the field box section — cost just $ 28 apiece			0
a spot on the berm , where you can practically chat with the outfielders , runs $ 8			0
as the afternoon settles into its final innings , the beer vendors hawk a final round of @entity233 and glance over their shoulders at the scoreboard			0
the light that washes over the stadium takes on a golden hue			0
that 's when it feels like , every now and then , life presents us with a perfect moment			0
and miraculously , the @entity42 beat the @entity247 9 - 3			1
where to stay a mile from @entity83 , the @entity249 is a newly renovated high - rise hotel with a @entity42 baseball package rate that includes a standard room and grandstand seats for two			1
