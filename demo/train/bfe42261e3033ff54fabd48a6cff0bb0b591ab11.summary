@entity0 -- the servers hosting the web sites of the @entity4 and its members have been overwhelmed with millions of e-mails in the past few days , forcing administrators to implement the " digital version of a traffic cop " to handle the overload			1
servers hosting web sites of the @entity4 have been flooded with millions of e-mails in recent days			1
" this is unprecedented , " said @entity14 , communications director for the @entity4 's chief administrator			1
the tidal waves of e-mails and page views began after negotiators announced sunday that a deal had been reached on legislation to enact a $ 700 billion bailout of the country 's financial system			1
in making the announcement , legislators said the public could view the agreement at @entity30			2
" in a short period of time , lots of web users were rushing to the digital doorway to get a copy of this thing , " @entity14 told @entity1 in a phone interview			2
as millions of people tried to look at the details of the bailout plan , the @entity4 system became overwhelmed and many people saw notices on their computer screens saying " this page does not appear			1
" ireport.com : do you support a bailout ? @entity14 compared the situation to the " old days , when you listened to a radio show and the 10th caller got a toaster			0
then everyone calls the same 1 - 800 number at the same time and all you got was a busy signal			0
" " this was a massive digital busy signal , " he said			0
as more people gained access to the page and details of the bailout proposal were published in the news media , constituents then started to e-mail their representatives , @entity14 explained			0
" we know it 's in the millions , " he said of the number of e-mails that lawmakers in the @entity4 have been receiving			1
" but we have n't counted yet , because when you 're about to get hit by a tidal wave , you do n't count the drops of water in the wave			0
" after the @entity4 failed to pass the proposed deal monday by a vote of 228 - 205 , the e-mail volume surged again , @entity14 said			0
" because there were so many e-mails , it was impacting even the presentation of @entity4 , " he explained			2
" this morning , our engineers sounded the alarms ... and we have installed a digital version of a traffic cop			1
we enacted stopgaps that we planned for last night			0
we had hoped we did n't have to			0
" the office of the chief administrative officer of the @entity4 issued a statement tuesday saying : " this measure has become temporarily necessary to ensure that congressional web sites are not completely disabled by the millions of e-mails flowing into the system			1
engineers are working diligently to accommodate this enormous traffic flow and we appreciate your patience in this matter			0
" now , when @entity4 or individual members ' sites begin to get overloaded , a message will come up on the computer screen saying , in effect , " try back later , " @entity14 said			2
" this really tells us that the level of constituent engagement on this issue is extremely high , " he added			0
he said after the failed vote monday and the initial backlash , the @entity4 's web site administrators thought there would be a drop in web traffic -- especially with the @entity117 holiday			1
" we monitored the situation all night long , and technicians and engineers saw that we were facing the same demand as yesterday , " @entity14 said			0
he predicted that traffic on those web sites " would start to subside once there 's some guidance on the marketplace and political landscape about what comes next			1
" @entity14 said the @entity4 web site experienced a very high number of hits when the 9/11 commission released its final report on the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks against the @entity135 , but nothing like what the site has seen in the past few days .			2
