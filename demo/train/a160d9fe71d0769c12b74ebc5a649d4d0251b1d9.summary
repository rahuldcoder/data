-- the 1980 cult - classic film " @entity2 " could very well get a sequel now that @entity4 has published his long - awaited followup to the 1977 novel			1
" @entity12 " picks up with @entity7 , the clairvoyant boy at the center of " @entity2 , " as a middle - aged man still in possession of his disturbing psychic powers			1
@entity4 's agent says @entity14 owns the movie rights to the sequel , just as it did the original film directed by the @entity18			1
our sources in @entity21 say the studio is in the very early stages of developing a possible sequel to the film			1
it will be a tough act to follow			2
@entity18 's adaptation of " @entity2 " ( which @entity4 reportedly never liked ) continues to fascinate -- and terrify -- viewers more than three decades after it first hit theaters			1
this year alone has seen several examples of its persistent hold on the imagination including the release of " @entity35 , " a documentary exploring claims by a variety of theorists that kubrick deliberately inserted coded symbols and meanings into his film ; a major exhibit on @entity18 at the @entity45 featuring a unique gallery devoted to " @entity2 " ; and the public display of an elaborate recreation of " @entity2 " by sculptor @entity49			1
one reason " @entity2 " continues to hold power over audiences is that it rewards multiple viewings , says artist and set designer @entity54			1
" it has so many issues going on simultaneously that i think people find things in it over and over again , " she said			2
' @entity2 ' by the numbers @entity54 , who also designed the @entity18 exhibit at the @entity45 , offers a number of reasons for the film 's ongoing appeal			1
" there are these really striking images : the blood flowing from the elevators , " she said			2
" @entity71 ( who plays @entity72 ) , a great performance by him , and the strange relationship between he and @entity75 ( who plays @entity76 )			2
it has this issue about couples going on ( in it )			2
" a movie about couples -- that is only one of many ways to understand " @entity2			1
" in fact , the movie may have produced more possible interpretations than any other film			1
" most movies work on two levels , " said filmmaker @entity89			2
" just maybe ' @entity2 ' works on five			1
" @entity89 directed the documentary " @entity35 , " which explores the growing number of theories -- advanced by critics , historians and enthusiasts -- to explain what @entity18 " really meant to say " with " @entity2			1
" these observers ( obsessives , others call them ) are convinced @entity18 inserted certain motifs and images into the film to direct the discerning eye towards the real theme of his work			2
theory no. 1 : " @entity2 " is really about the extermination of the @entity110			1
evidence : dialogue not found in @entity4 's novel suggests that the @entity114 was built over a @entity116 burial ground			1
@entity18 used @entity118 baking powder cans , with their distinctive headdress logo , in the @entity121 's larder			0
theory no. 2 : the @entity124 interpretation			0
@entity7 and his father are in competition for @entity76 's attention / affection			0
@entity72 wants to kill @entity7 ; @entity7 ends up , in effect , killing his father			0
evidence : in one scene , @entity76 and @entity7 watch the movie " summer of ' 42 , " the story of a schoolboy in love with an older married woman			0
" it 's kind of a loaded scene for a little boy to be watching with his mom , " @entity89 noted			0
theory no. 3 : " @entity2 " is @entity18 's apology for having faked the apollo moon landing footage			1
evidence : @entity7 wears a sweater emblazoned with an image of the @entity150 rocket			0
and @entity18 changed the pivotal @entity151 in the original novel to @entity35 in the movie			0
the moon , at certain points of its orbit , is 237,000 miles away from the @entity157			0
okay , this one is kind of out there , and it presupposes that the moon landing footage people watched in 1969 indeed was faked and that @entity18 created the phony footage at @entity164 's request			0
theory no. 4 : " @entity2 " is really about the horrors of @entity167 , an interpretation advanced by historian @entity169 , a professor at @entity170			1
evidence : @entity72 types his magnum opus on a @entity175 - made @entity174 typewriter			0
" i 'm a @entity175 historian , and so i know that @entity176 means ' eagle ' in @entity175 , " @entity169 said			2
" i had some research on @entity18 and knew that he had a tendency in his films to refer to eagles as a symbol of state power , and so it seemed to me that this typewriter was significant			0
it was not a choice simply of having any old typewriter			0
" @entity169 said @entity18 was extremely well - versed in the history of @entity190 and wanted to direct a film about the holocaust but ultimately decided to tackle the subject indirectly through " @entity2			1
" another clue to that theme is the repeated visual reference to the number 42 , @entity169 said			0
" the first time we see 42 , it 's on the sleeve of a jersey that @entity7 is wearing , and it 's when he 's having his first vision of the @entity121 , and that vision consists of ... the elevator doors slowly opening and oceans of blood slowly pouring out , " @entity169 said			0
the @entity114 " is associated with mighty and obscene power , and the other references to 42 in the film therefore arguably -- and i think convincingly -- constitute a pattern of reference to the year 1942 , which was the deadliest year of the @entity192			2
" other observers have studied the film 's slow dissolves frame by frame in a search for clues about what @entity18 intended to say			2
another theorist played the film backward and forward simultaneously , superimposing the footage in an effort to detect hidden meanings			1
so what did @entity18 have to say by way of explaining " @entity2 " ? not much			1
" he was n't the kind of guy to talk about the themes or the symbolism in his movies , " @entity89 noted			0
@entity169 added that @entity18 " thought that if you simply told people what you were thinking or what they should think , that it would n't mean very much to them ( anymore )			0
" @entity49 , a @entity238 - based sculptor who is such a " @entity2 " fan that he re-created the major characters out of silicone , discounts the elaborate theories meant to explain the film			1
" i do n't know if i buy all of them , " @entity49 said			0
" i think ( @entity18 ) might have been throwing some stuff in there to mess with us			0
" he instead takes the film at something closer to face value			2
" to me , it 's just like the best horror movie ever made , " he said			0
" ever since i was 11 years old , when i ( first ) saw it , it 's just something that 's just kind of stuck with me			0
i ca n't turn it off when it 's on			0
" devotion like that means any sequel to the film will have an impossible time living up to the original , especially as @entity18 is unavailable to direct it			1
@entity266 doubts a sequel could compare favorably to the original			2
" i do n't think we 'll see a type of thoughtful and artistic production that @entity18 could have made , " he said			0
" he was among the greats among filmmakers , who ranks with ( @entity275 ) @entity274 , ( @entity276 ) @entity277 and ( @entity278 ... so , no , i do n't have great optimism that the sequel will measure up in any way to @entity18 's ' @entity2			1

@entity4 has published a sequel to his book " @entity2 "
devotees continue to seek out hidden meanings in the film
historian says " @entity2 " was about @entity167
