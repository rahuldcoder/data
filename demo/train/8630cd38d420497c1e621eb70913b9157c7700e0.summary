the economy 's in the tank , the currency 's crumbling , and he 's risking diplomatic isolation for doubling down on @entity7			2
so how is it that @entity10 president @entity9 's popularity is at a whopping 86 % ? that 's the conclusion of a poll conducted this month by the @entity13			1
last month , @entity9 's approval rating was at 85 %			1
the @entity13 describes itself as an independent , non-governmental polling and sociological research organization			0
and it has found that @entity9 's approval ratings have been holding steady in the mid- 80s since around may last year , which incidentally is when the @entity7 / @entity19 conflict bubbled up			1
what gives ? the answer is simple , says @entity22 , author of " @entity23 : how @entity24 with @entity9			1
" " that figure is made up , " he told @entity0 last month			0
" an opinion poll can only be conducted in a democracy with a free press , " he explained			0
" in a country with no free press , where people are arrested for expressing their opinions , where the truth is hidden from them , where the media even online is almost all controlled by the government -- when a pollster phones people up and asks , ' hello , do you approve of @entity9 , ' the answer is overwhelmingly yes			1
" so what that opinion poll is , is not a poll of approval but it 's a poll of fear			1
" there 's another factor at play			0
@entity9 has remained defiant in the face of @entity50 sanctions and political pressure to stand down in @entity7			2
and that defiance is earning him political points at home despite the impact on the @entity10 economy			0
@entity57 , an international affairs professor at the @entity58 specializing in @entity10 politics , said on the whole , the polls reflect the reality on the ground of popular support for @entity9			2
" i do n't think @entity10 are really hiding their feelings , " @entity57 told @entity0 in december , adding that the polls indicate support for @entity9 , but not necessarily the depth of that support			2
media propaganda plays a key role in bolstering @entity9 's popularity , @entity57 said , especially in the portrayal of @entity7 's popular revolt as a fascist takeover and in portraying the annexation of @entity19 as , essentially , a rescue mission			1
@entity78 's ok , but families have mouths to feed			0
and if @entity10 's economic problems get worse , that could bode ill for @entity9			1
" even if he can keep strong popular support , @entity9 has to worry most of all about keeping happy the oligarchs , the wealthy @entity10 who back him in exchange for continued prosperity , " says @entity83 , a world affairs columnist for the @entity85 , in a piece for @entity0			2
" economic sanctions and a shrinking economy will not make them happy			0
" this report incorporates information previously published in a piece by @entity0 's @entity96 in december			0
@entity0 's @entity97 in @entity98 and @entity99 in @entity100 contributed to this report .			0
