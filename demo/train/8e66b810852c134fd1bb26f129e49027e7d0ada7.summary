the world is expected to get a look at the findings of @entity4 weapons inspectors monday as @entity6 powers work to turn a @entity9 - @entity8 framework on @entity11 's chemical weapons into a concrete plan			1
@entity4 @entity13 ban ki - moon received the inspectors ' report on the august poison gas attack outside @entity17 on sunday , the @entity4 announced			1
@entity13 is scheduled to brief the @entity6 on the report in a closed - door session monday morning -- and two diplomats told @entity21 the report is likely to be released publicly at that time			1
the attack led to @entity9 threats of military action in @entity11 , where a civil war has left more than 100,000 dead since 2011 , and @entity28 's stated decision to hand its chemical weapons arsenal over to international control			1
saturday , @entity9 secretary of state @entity31 and @entity8 foreign minister @entity32 laid out a series of steps the @entity28 must take to eliminate its stockpile			1
the plan now goes to the @entity6 , where members are working to craft a resolution that will keep the process under review and allow the world body to consider the use of force if @entity11 fails to comply			2
that effort will start at @entity4 headquarters in @entity46 and in @entity47 , where @entity49 president @entity48 told the television network @entity50 talks would start " as soon as tomorrow " among @entity31 , @entity49 foreign minister @entity52 and @entity54 foreign secretary @entity53			1
" then @entity52 will go to @entity8 to meet with his @entity8 counterpart to end this process , and we could vote on this resolution before the end of the week , " @entity48 said			0
but he added , " this does not mean that we would be done with the case			0
the violence is still ongoing , the war in @entity11 is still ongoing , so the next step will be to find a political solution			2
" under the plan , @entity17 must submit a comprehensive list of its chemical arsenal within one week , and international inspectors must be on the ground no later than november			0
senior @entity71 officials said that according to the timeline , initial inspections of declared chemical weapons sites must be completed by november ; all production and mixing and filling equipment must be destroyed by november ; and all chemical weapons material must be eliminated by mid- 2014			0
framework for eliminating chemical weapons @entity8 is @entity11 's leading ally and has vetoed @entity6 resolutions on the conflict in the past			1
@entity84 , the fifth of the veto - wielding @entity6 members , said sunday it welcomed the deal			2
" we believe this framework agreement has cooled the tense situation in @entity11 and has opened a new opportunity to use a peaceful means to resolve the chemical weapons issue , " foreign minister @entity88 said after a meeting with @entity52 in @entity90			1
the verification and destruction process will be carried out by personnel from both the @entity4 and the @entity100 , the body that implements the international ban on chemical weapons use , according to the framework agreement			1
a diplomatic source said the @entity100 will assess the timeline @entity31 and @entity32 laid out in @entity107 to assist negotiations at the @entity4			1
@entity11 confirmed it had chemical weapons in 2012			2
@entity9 intelligence estimates it possesses about 1,000 tons of ordnance -- mostly the nerve gases sarin and @entity113 , which cause convulsions , paralysis , respiratory failure , and death , but also mustard gas , which inflicted horrific casualties on the battlefields of @entity122 i. @entity28 official hails ' victory ' in @entity107 a @entity28 official , national reconciliation minister @entity126 , called the framework a " victory " and thanked @entity8 for orchestrating a chemical weapons deal to avert @entity9 military action , @entity8 's state - run news agency @entity125 reported			1
" on the one hand , they will help @entity28 come out of the crisis , and on the other hand , they prevented the war against @entity11 by having removed a pretext for those who wanted to unleash it , " @entity125 quoted @entity126			1
he called the deal an achievement of @entity8 diplomacy , and " a victory for @entity11 won thanks to our @entity8 friends			1
" @entity9 , @entity8 agree to framework but in @entity147 , where he met sunday with prime minister @entity148 , @entity31 told reporters that " the threat of force remains " to make sure @entity11 follows through with the agreement			2
" i want people to understand the key elements of what we agreed to in @entity107			0
it is a framework , not a final agreement , " he said			0
" it is a framework that must be put into effect by the @entity4 now			2
" and @entity48 told @entity50 that " the military option must remain			1
" " one must take into account the threat of sanctions , if the agreement and the results of the @entity6 @entity4 resolution were not carried out , " he said			0
" therefore , we must ensure that there is some kind of sanction if it is not applied			0
" a @entity4 diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , told @entity21 that the technical timeline agreed to in @entity107 would not be revisited this week in @entity46			1
the thornier question of whether a resolution should be under chapter 7 of the @entity179 -- which potentially authorizes the use of force if @entity11 is in violation -- remains to be worked out			0
" you can not just copy and paste what 's in @entity107 into the resolution , " the diplomat said			2
also remaining to be discussed is whether any resolution would condemn @entity188 's government for the august 21 attack and whether it would call for those accused of ordering the strike to face trial before the @entity193			0
both the @entity4 diplomat and a @entity196 diplomat said a vote is n't likely before mid-week , perhaps wednesday			2
the @entity196 powers have blamed government troops for the poison gas attack , which @entity202 says may have killed more than 1,400 people			0
@entity11 's government denies using chemical weapons and has said rebel forces used poison gas on its forces			1
but in a report issued last week , @entity209 said @entity188 's forces " were almost certainly responsible , " citing photos of and videos from the attack scene that pointed to weapons not known to be in rebel hands			0
opposition group wants @entity28 air power restricted a leading @entity28 opposition group said sunday that a ban on chemical weapons is n't enough , and called for the @entity28 regime to end the use of air power over populated areas			1
" the @entity227 insists that the ban of use of chemical weapons , which led to the loss of lives of more than 1,400 @entity28 civilians , must be extended to ban the use of the regime air power and ballistic weapons against population centers , in addition to the redeployment of heavy weapons away from population centers , and the prohibition of use of these weapons to bomb @entity28 cities and villages , " the group said in a statement			2
" the world must not allow the @entity188 regime to take advantage of the @entity8 initiative and their joining the treaty on the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons as an excuse to continue the daily slaughter of the @entity28 people with impunity , " it added			0
the group expressed skepticism about the chemical weapons deal			0
" the @entity188 regime has a long track record of deceit when it comes to dealing with the treaties and empty promises in the regime attempt to buy more time , " the coalition statement said			0
it called on its supporters in the region and in the @entity271 to strengthen its military capabilities			0
" the coalition calls upon the @entity275 brothers and @entity11 military to strengthen the arm capability of the military opposition to be able to neutralize the @entity188 air force and his tanks to force the regime to end its military campaign and accept a political solution that will lead to a democratic transition in @entity11 , " it said			1
last week , gen. @entity285 , head of the rebel @entity286 , said he has information that @entity11 has already started to move chemical materials and weapons out of the country , into @entity291 and @entity292			0
@entity292 denied the allegation , calling it " cheap propaganda			0
" " we confirm that @entity292 is against possessing such weapons and other weapons of mass destruction anywhere in the world and under any excuse , " said a statement sunday from the @entity292 prime minister 's office .			0

@entity4 inspectors deliver their report to @entity13 ban ki - moon
" the military option must remain , " @entity49 president says
a @entity28 official calls the @entity107 framework announced saturday a " victory "
@entity11 's opposition says the deal does n't go far enough
