@entity1 , @entity0 -- if @entity5 president @entity4 is to be believed , it 's the biggest issue that faces football			1
no , not diving , or @entity8 hegemony or even the tackle from behind but rather the naturalization of players from other countries , especially @entity13 , becoming common currency in the international game			1
@entity13 - born @entity16 was the first naturalized footballer to play for the @entity18 national team			1
" if we do n't take care about the invaders from @entity13 , " @entity4 controversially said at the draw for the @entity20			1
" then at the next @entity24 ... we will have 16 [ teams ] full of @entity13 players			1
it 's a danger , a real , real danger			0
" players born outside of their country of citizenship have always played for their newly adopted countries			0
@entity32 started life with an @entity35 passport before turning out for @entity36 and @entity37			0
@entity38 also represented @entity37 after making his name for @entity40			0
do you think you players should be able to adopt a new country and play for them ? but two things have changed			0
the first is the globalized nature of the sport , which has allowed @entity13 to sell arguably its greatest export -- talented footballers -- to every corner of the world			1
the second is the emerging power and wealth of smaller states willing to use their financial muscle to attract better players to their national team			1
@entity5 has been extremely critical of countries that have handed passports -- some after playing in their new country for less than two years -- to talented footballers			2
the problem @entity5 has found is separating the naturalization of a player who has genuinely put down roots in their new country -- as with @entity65 who moved to @entity66 when he was 15 -- and those whose allegiances are bought and sold in a rudimentary international transfer system			1
one country that has stretched the rules to breaking point is @entity73 , who has used its vast gas wealth to attract and naturalize a host of players from @entity78 and @entity13			1
the @entity73 fa even offered to pay @entity13 striker @entity80 , then the top scorer in the @entity83 @entity82 , $ 1million to come and play for @entity73 in 2004 , even though he had never set foot in the country			2
the move led to @entity5 introducing emergency legislation banning naturalizations from taking place if there was no connection between the player and their prospective country			2
@entity5 has tried to tighten up the rules			2
last may @entity5 agreed a rule change which stated that a player must live in their new country for five years before they can play for the national team			1
have the rules on naturalization of footballers devalued international football ? but for a country the size of @entity73 , which has a population of fewer than one million , there are few other options			1
" the only way @entity73 or @entity114 are ever going to be competitive is to import players and naturalize them , " explains @entity108 , an @entity109 writer on @entity111 football and author of " 15 days in june : how @entity109 became a @entity116			2
" yet ultimately @entity73 's experiment in footballing naturalization looks to have paid off			0
they currently sit third in their @entity121 qualifying group and are on course for a play - off spot for @entity125 2010 thanks , in no small part , to the goals of their @entity78 - born striker @entity128			0
if they qualify they will be the smallest country to ever make it to the finals			0
even more established footballing nations -- like @entity37 with @entity136 and @entity18 with @entity16 -- have looked at naturalization to fill problem positions in their team			0
while @entity0 - born @entity140 swapped the vagaries of lower league football in the @entity143 for @entity144 after being released by non-league @entity145			0
five years later he married his @entity144 girlfriend after some gentle persuasion from the national team coach and now anchors the team 's midfield			0
" i did n't even know where @entity144 was ! " he told the @entity143 's @entity152 newspaper last year			0
@entity154 suggested that his @entity37 goalkeeper @entity155 , who qualifies for a @entity143 passport after living in the @entity143 for five years , is the answer to @entity0 's goalkeeping problems			0
so will @entity13 imports really takeover the international game ? many are skeptical			1
" @entity4 is fearful that @entity24 will be overrun with naturalized @entity13 and has proposed strict rules for naturalizing players , but these are just scare tactics , " concludes @entity108			1
" at the end of the day people want to see the majority of the players in their national team ' represent ' them			2
" what do you think ? let us know your views in the sound - off box below .			0

a look at a team of naturalized players plying their trade in world football .
the team is *largely* made of @entity13 want a taste of international football ,
