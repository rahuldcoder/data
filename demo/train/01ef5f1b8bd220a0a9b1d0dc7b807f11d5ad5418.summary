@entity0 -- whether or not we witness a " @entity4 " from the @entity6 football on friday night , it is surely a delicious irony that @entity8 and @entity9 are squared up			1
i stopped in at my local toy store friday morning , where a @entity8 flag has been waving proudly above the door all week			1
according to the owner , it 's not if @entity8 wins or loses this game , it 's how @entity8 wins or loses			1
pride and dignity need to be at the fore , in other words			2
i think this has been true through the entire euro crisis			0
you can not help but see that some @entity8 feel humiliated by the whole process			2
many @entity8 tell me they know the pain is necessary , but not this way			2
truth is , i think both sides in the @entity8 versus @entity9 drama are correct when it comes to how we got here			1
@entity8 did not modernize their economy while other countries did -- there are far too many state employees at far too many state - run firms			1
frankly , it 's hard to see how politicians could have done that in @entity8 given its legacy			1
leadership failed in @entity8 and the people let it happen			2
@entity8 's economic turmoil hits team on the other side , the @entity8 ( and the @entity46 and @entity47 ) splurged on a decade of cheap credit and low interest rates			1
part of that party money was spent on buying @entity9 - made goods and on money loaned by @entity9 banks looking for growth outside their natural borders			2
the fuel was easily on offer and everyone soaked it up			0
so , the crisis is not just the fault of the @entity8 , the @entity47 , the @entity46 and so on			1
they were allowed to get away with it for far too long			0
a common problem needs a common solution			0
yes , @entity68 moves painfully slowly and yes , they only seem to make major decisions when the crisis flares up			1
but at least they do make those decisions			0
@entity6 in pictures i suspect we are on the cusp on a new round of decisions			0
they may benefit the @entity46 and @entity80 more than others , given how important those economies are to the eurozone			0
my hope is that @entity8 falls off the radar of the markets and media again , for a number of months , while they get on with the painful restructuring			0
but it also needs to be done without humiliating the @entity8			0
they will certainly play with pride on friday night .			0

@entity1 's @entity94 notes the delicious irony of @entity8 and @entity9 facing off on the pitch
@entity8 is in a *financial* crisis and has been forced to take two *bailouts* from its @entity68 peers
@entity9 , the eurozone 's *largest* economy , has been the driving force behind the crisis plan
@entity8 say their football team must play with pride and dignity , no matter the *outcome*
