@entity0 , @entity1 -- sitting on their front porch in this @entity8 suburb , @entity3 and his family seem the picture of a contented family			1
but the @entity11 now wants to upend the family : threatening to deport his wife and 19 - year - old son back to their native @entity15 , even though he says federal prosecutors a decade ago promised him help and a @entity18 in exchange for @entity3 's promised testimony in a human smuggling case against a fellow @entity23 immigrant			1
for the @entity3 family , they believe it will mean great harm , even death , for those deported			1
a decade ago , @entity3 ( pronounced : dem - ear - eye ) was himself an illegal immigrant			1
he told @entity2 he had walked across the @entity32 border from @entity33 to @entity34 , @entity1 without any paperwork			0
he found work as a painter , he says , with a fellow @entity23 named @entity38			0
not long afterwards , the @entity11 indicted @entity38 , accusing him and others of running a human smuggling ring , bringing illegal aliens from @entity33 into the @entity32			1
@entity3 was named in the original indictment but charges against him were later dropped			1
attorneys for the @entity11 based in @entity8 wanted @entity3 to testify against @entity38			1
in exchange , @entity3 told @entity2 that prosecutors promised him and his family protection and promised him a @entity18 , which would lead to citizenship			1
the offer , he says , was verbal and not on paper			0
" i 'm ready to work for the @entity32 government , whatever they need from me , " @entity3 told @entity2			1
but @entity38 entered a plea of not guilty , was granted bail and soon fled to @entity15 , according to the @entity57 's office in @entity8			2
federal prosecutors did n't need @entity3 's testimony and handed him over to immigration officials , who quickly deported him as well			1
within a few weeks back in his native @entity15 , @entity3 says , @entity38 attacked him and tried to kill him			1
" i was on my knees and he pointed the gun straight at me , " @entity3 told @entity2			2
" @entity3 says it was only luck that saved him			2
neighbors , he said , heard the gunshot and came to his assistance			0
@entity38 fled , leaving @entity3 with a bullet wound in his side and stomach			2
@entity3 also says @entity38 forced three nieces into prostitution in @entity72 but they were eventually rescued			2
@entity3 returned once again to the @entity32 , again he says entering illegally at @entity34			2
this time , immigration agents apprehended him and he says he spent seven months in an immigration jail before being allowed to remain in the @entity32 on temporary status			0
that was six years ago			0
almost ever since his return to the @entity32 , he says , federal prosecutors have tried to deport his wife , @entity80 and son , @entity82 , back to @entity15			1
his two other smaller children were born in @entity1 and are legal residents			0
" what do you think will happen to your wife and son if they back to @entity15 , ? " @entity3 was asked			1
" oh , they 're going to be killed			0
they are going to be killed , " he replied			0
one federal prosecutor agreed , saying in an appellate court argument that " there is a possibility that mrs. @entity95 will be persecuted " if she returns to @entity15			2
still , she added , " she ( mrs. demiraj ) has n't met her legal burden when it comes to asylum			0
" even despite the dangers for @entity95 , the @entity11 is pursuing deportation			2
the original assistant @entity32 attorney who offered @entity3 a @entity18 and , according to him , protection will not comment to @entity2			0
she is @entity104 , now nominated by president @entity105 to be a federal judge			0
the only official comment to @entity2 from @entity108 is this : " the department is not aware of any promises of physical protection ever made to mr. @entity3 or his family			1
notwithstanding this fact , we have been ( in ) active discussions with counsel for the @entity3 family for some time			1
" @entity3 's lawyers are outraged			0
" this is just a shameful display of how the @entity32 government will use people who they need to keep us safe and then cavalierly discard them when they are no longer of use to them , " said @entity119 , a @entity120 attorney whose firm is now representing the family			0
@entity3 says he will never let his wife and son return to @entity15			1
" i do n't know what i am going to do , " he told @entity2			0
" but i am not going to let them go			0
