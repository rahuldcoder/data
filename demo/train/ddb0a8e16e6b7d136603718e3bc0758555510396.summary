-- the @entity1 is urging hunters and fishermen to keep their eyes open for marijuana growing operations in @entity8 's @entity7			1
since 2008 , nine marijuana growing operations have been discovered on public land within the state			1
most recently , in late august , a fisherman visiting the forest happened upon a marijuana field that netted more than 8,000 plants worth $ 8 million			1
" the fisherman was walking along the banks of the @entity17 and noticed these patches that had been cleared and disturbed			1
trees were down , things did n't look right , and he reported that to authorities , and a surveillance operation was established , " said @entity19 , a spokeswoman for the @entity1 eastern region			1
marijuana legalization : @entity27 pursuing ? approximately 150 federal , state , tribal and local law enforcement agents were involved in the sting that followed , leading to the arrest of seven people			1
all of the suspects pleaded guilty and are in prison awaiting trial			0
the suspects each face anywhere from 10 years to life in prison , a maximum fine of $ 10 million and five years to life of supervised release			0
the @entity44 could not comment on details of the investigation because the case is still working its way through the judicial system			0
but this is n't the first time this has happened , the @entity1 says			1
it 's actually the third big bust in three years at the forest , resulting in the eradication of more than 80,000 marijuana plants that were cultivated by large drug trafficking organizations			1
that 's why authorities say they are reaching out to hunters in their regulation books and offering them training programs , warning them to be careful and asking them to note the gps location of any suspicious areas and call the authorities as soon as they can			1
" @entity7 is large , secluded and heavily roaded , so our personnel can not by themselves keep an eye on every acre , " @entity65 said			0
" that 's why we are relying on forest users to share information with us			2
" by using covert digital cameras , gps devices and ground and aerial surveillance , law enforcement officials do what they can to apprehend illegal marijuana growers who frequently switch up their patterns to avoid detection			2
" we conduct aerial surveillance , and we have seen a change in the growers ' tactics			0
a number of years ago , there would be large multithousand plant fields concentrated in one area , and now they have a couple of hundred plants in one location and then another couple hundred plants a couple hundred yards away which makes aerial detection more difficult , " said @entity88 , the director of field operations for the @entity91 's criminal investigation division			2
@entity8 attorney general @entity102 said he and special agents at the @entity91 are " not only aggressively investigating and eradicating these grows , but also working with our local and federal partners to hold accountable the individuals responsible for operating such grow operations			1
" highs and lows of using marijuana " that kind of aggressive eradication and enforcement ought to send a message to those who think they can profit from growing illegal drugs on @entity8 's public lands , threatening our natural resources and potentially the people who enjoy them , " he said in a statement to @entity0			1
@entity88 says that every occupied marijuana growing operation that led to arrests has also resulted in the seizure of firearms , and they 've also found ammunition left behind by other growers			2
the concern is that a person walking through the forest will come across not only an illegal grow operation , but also heavily armed growers			2
" if they are protecting $ 10 million of marijuana plants , that 's a lot of money , and there have been gun battles with law enforcement in other states such as @entity147 , " @entity88 said			1
" we worry that they will bring the same level of violence with them			0
" because the concern for public safety is so great , the state attorney general 's office works in conjunction with the @entity44 to strongly prosecute marijuana growers			2
" we believe we need to arrest people in order to send a message to these marijuana growers that they are not welcome in @entity8 and that their activities will be not be accepted , " @entity88 said			1
@entity8 is targeting illegal marijuana growers because it has millions of acres of remote public land			1
according to the state @entity44 , 32 people have been arrested for illegally growing marijuana since 2008 , and most were non- @entity170 citizens in the country illegally			1
all of the suspects are expected to serve their sentences before they are deported , the department says			0
several suspects interviewed by law enforcement said they were recruited from @entity147 to come to @entity8			1
in some cases they were told openly that they are to work in a marijuana growing operation , while in other cases they came believing they were to work in a restaurant			2
some suspects also said they did n't even know what state they were in			0
@entity185 , public affairs officer for the @entity7 , said that these growers operate on a large scale			0
" they are large , drug trafficking organizations ; they are not mom and pop operations , " she said			0
" these are people doing this to make a lot of money			0
" the operations also cause serious damage to the forest			2
the growers chop down trees to let sunlight filter through to their plants , divert water away from trout streams and filter harmful chemicals back into the water			0
" it causes a lot of environmental damage from soil erosion and it increases sedimentation in rivers and streams which affects the fish			0
there is possibility of chemical runoff from poisons and other wastes , " @entity185 said			0
" they destroy the vegetation and leave their garbage behind			0
" it leaves a scar on the landscape , " she said .			0

80,000 marijuana plants eradicated in @entity8 forest
many of those arrested in busts are in the country illegally
