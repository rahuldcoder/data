basketball ? baseball ? neither			0
the answer is ... lacrosse			2
the " @entity15 " culture is well known on @entity3 -- but the way in is blocked to all those who failed to play the sport to a high level at college			0

" with lacrosse you 're working in a team environment , which is really beneficial when it comes to business			2

" a lot of the guys go out of their way to help graduates from their old schools get a job			0
" lacrosse is big on @entity3 and has helped a lot of people			2

one of the most sport 's most prolific goalscorers , the 28 - year - old has been the standout player for the @entity59 over the past season -- though last weekend he suffered a serious knee injury that will rule him out until next year			1
@entity30 , who runs the club 's community program as part of his job during the week , has been one of the leading voices in promoting the sport in recent years			1
box lacrosse , which is played inside hockey arenas during the summer on artificial grass , has been gaining popularity across the @entity96 and @entity60			1

" in the @entity96 it 's growing like wildfire , " says @entity30 , who also plays field lacrosse in the summer			1
" in @entity60 , it 's a lot more of a natural progression , where it 's basically you 're signing up one kid at a time			1
" that 's what i do for the @entity59 , which is helping minor associations grow and try and help figure out how we can capture the same growth that 's happening south of the border			1
" i think it 's happening and with the @entity59 being a high profile team and on television all the time , it helps that but there is work to be done			1
" @entity46 has spent his entire life in love with lacrosse			2
he is only half - joking when he says " when i 'm not playing lacrosse then he 's usually thinking about lacrosse			1
" but this summer , he 's got something else to think about -- his wedding			1
@entity46 will marry fiancee @entity145 on june 7 after proposing late last year -- a moment which was more terrifying than any he has faced on a lacrosse field			1
" i proposed on @entity149 , " he says			0
" maybe it was a bit @entity151 but she did n't have a clue it was coming			0
" i spoke to her dad the day before and we decided that i 'd do it in front of the family when we were giving presents			0
" she really wanted me to get her the box set of ' @entity165 ' but then with my last gift , i gave her the ring and asked her to marry me			0
" i was pretty confident she 'd say yes but that 's the most nervous i 've ever been			0
she had no idea whatsoever it was coming			0
" with his injury blow , @entity46 will have more time to plan his nuptials			0
it did n't prevent him from becoming the first player in the history of the @entity175 to register 100 - point hauls ( a combination of goals and assists ) in three successive seasons , though he will miss the climax to the campaign			1
" i could n't have got luckier to play for the @entity59 because it was the team that i grew up watching , " says @entity30			1
