it is , he likes to think , an @entity6 dream			2
@entity2 goes on patrol as a mall cop in " @entity9			1
" only @entity1 's dream involves looming clouds of cancer , screaming children and loaded shotguns			2
in his dream he vanquishes evil , disperses the dark clouds and accepts the gratitude that is rightly bestowed on the lawman			2
he believes his destiny is to be a cop			1
in reality , he 's chief security officer at the mall			1
i know : you already saw this movie : " @entity26 : @entity27			1
no jokes to speak of			2
you 're only half wrong			2
there are strong similarities between " @entity35 " and @entity2 's film , " @entity9			1
" both movies are portraits of chubby guys who do n't fit the profile and ca n't make the grade			2
both men are socially inept , they live with their moms and hold a crush on a sales assistant who should be out of their league ( here , the fearlessly nasty @entity50 )			0
they 're also delusional enough to equate a badge and a uniform with their own heroic self - image , though in their heart of hearts they know they wo n't be real men until they 're packing a gun			0
" @entity9 " is the r - rated version of this peculiar suburban fantasy , a much edgier movie that dares to keep its mall cop at arm 's length			1
just because he 's sad and pathetic , that does n't mean @entity1 is n't a potential psychopath			0
he 's closer to @entity70 than to cuddly @entity28			0
this may be the first time @entity2 has stepped out of his comfort zone as an actor			1
with his hair cropped to a @entity77 buzz , and cutting out the winks and the wisecracks ( @entity1 has no sense of humor ) , @entity2 refuses to soften us up or apologize for the character 's low iq			1
the movie is funnier for his control , and also more disturbing			1
more than once , writer - director @entity87 teases out the slippy , gray area between a subversive gross - out gag and something unsettlingly misogynist			0
he wants to push buttons , and he 's talented enough to get away with it			0
at one point he sets up a scene in which @entity1 learns he 's flunked his psych test for the police force			0
while he 's still processing this latest rejection , a detective emerges from his hiding place in the closet			0
" i thought this was going to be funny , " he explains sheepishly			1
" but it 's just sad			0
" played that way , the scene is both			0
plainly influenced by the observational embarrassments of tv 's " @entity106 , " @entity87 took an equally jaundiced view of the male animal in his first film , " the @entity110 , " a low - budget black comedy with @entity113 as a gung - ho martial arts instructor			0
( @entity115 pops up here as a violent crack dealer			0
) machismo is about the only source of pride @entity87 's anti-heroes can afford			0
the budget for " @entity9 " is probably 20 times what @entity87 had to spend on his debut , but his characters have stayed on the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder ; they may fancy themselves above it all , but they know where the bottom is			1
so it makes a kind of sense that when a flasher starts terrorizing the mall , @entity1 should seize on this as his opportunity to shine			1
" that pervert is the best thing that ever happened to me , " he says			0
the flasher 's eventual full - frontal appearance supplies the movie with a suitably in - your - face climax , as well as extending contemporary film comedy 's undeclared mission to domesticate the male organ			1
ever since " @entity150 " -- in " @entity151 " and " @entity152 " and " @entity153 " -- it seems like there 's nothing funnier than a penis on the loose			2
ireport.com : what do you think of " @entity9 " ? but it 's the naked anger @entity2 and @entity87 reveal that makes " @entity9 " a sticky proposition			1
it 's consistently sharper and wittier than " @entity27 , " but @entity87 's disconcerting habit of making his biggest laughs stick in your throat could prove a hard sell			0
it 's no " @entity26 , " but is it art ? " @entity9 " is rated r and runs 86 minutes			1
for @entity171 's review , click here .			0

" @entity9 " is another movie about a mall cop , but oh , does it cut *deeply*
@entity2 stars as a *frustrated* mall officer wanting bigger things
the movie is funny -- and *occasionally* disturbing
