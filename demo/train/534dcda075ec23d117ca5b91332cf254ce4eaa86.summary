@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's parliament has ratified a 20 - year $ 98 million loan from @entity5 to build a defense college , despite objections from members of prime minister @entity10 's party that the poverty - stricken country should prioritize the spending in other ways			1
@entity1 's upper and lower houses of parliament passed the deal late tuesday after heated debate			1
@entity18 , a member of parliament from @entity10 's @entity20 party , said he was surprised that @entity5 companies including @entity22 -- which has interests in diamonds - had been contracted to construct the college that is being built about 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) north of @entity0			1
" we are talking of a law which says 51 % of any business transaction must be for @entity1 , but in this deal @entity5 have become @entity1 , " said @entity18 in an interview wednesday , repeating what he had said when opposing the passing of the loan facility in parliament the previous day			2
other members of parliament said the country needed to first address the ailing economy before constructing the college			2
@entity1 's minister of defense , @entity37 , told parliament that the college would offer " specialized military training and learning of security issues " taught by senior officials in defense forces and civilians both in the country and from abroad			1
@entity5 has become a close ally of @entity1 , standing by it while the @entity47 ostracizes president @entity48 for the long - term leader 's poor human rights record			0
in 2008 , @entity5 vetoed a @entity52 resolution seeking sanctions against @entity1			0
@entity5 companies have made inroads in @entity1 especially in construction industry			0
earlier this year , the visiting @entity5 vice premier , @entity57 , signed about $ 700 million in loan agreements with @entity1			0
the loan was the biggest international deal in years for @entity1 , which continues to be shunned by the @entity47 for its failure to service its external debt which is about $ 7 billion .			0

the money will go to building a defense college
some members of @entity1 's parliament oppose the deal
they argue that the poverty - stricken country should spend the money in other ways
