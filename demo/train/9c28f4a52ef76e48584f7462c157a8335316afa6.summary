@entity0 -- it is the second big speech of his presidency 's second act , but there is little or nothing to suggest president @entity9 's @entity8 offers any hope of a new beginning or a new spirit in divided @entity0			1
consider the vast partisan differences in expectations			0
" @entity9 core supporters are getting what they hoped for in 2009 , " says veteran @entity16 pollster and strategist @entity15			1
" he is a president who seems both more confident and at the same time at home with himself both legislatively and philosophically			1
" if there is one certainty in today 's political climate , it is that when one party is happy , the other is not			0
security clearance : foreign policy will take back seat " republicans should wear asbestos suits to the @entity36 chamber because they 're going to be torched , " said longtime @entity32 operative @entity31 , a veteran of senior jobs in the @entity36 leadership , the @entity37 and the @entity38 @entity36			0
" president @entity9 seems to think that the best way to get things done is not by retail persuasion but by wholesale attacking			1
" the president 's wish list already has him on a collision course with the @entity32 on several fronts , from the familiar sniping over taxes and spending and red ink to new battle lines over @entity36 calls for sweeping changes to immigration and gun laws			1
veterans of previous administration note the first year of the second term is critical			1
" of his second term , this is the one that will get the most attention , " said @entity62 , the @entity38 confidante			1
" this is the list of what he still wants to accomplish as president			2
" as such , @entity62 said , the biggest challenge is focus			2
" it was never my favorite speech because it is a legislative laundry list and everyone is trying to get their piece in , " @entity62 said			2
huge challenge : how will we reduce the deficit ? the biggest immediate challenge is a carryover from the first term : navigating differences over how to achieve a substantial deficit reduction package			1
a march 1 deadline looms when temporary fixes enacted in the first term essentially expire and across - the - board spending cuts known as sequestration loom if no new plan is passed			1
" the economy still languishes and the obvious threat is sequestration , which is omnipresent , " is how @entity15 described the moment to @entity1			2
" but i think the president can look presidential and put the @entity96			2
" there is little doubt that the president has the upper hand in the battle for public opinion : what he calls a " balanced approach " of more tax revenues and spending cuts including , again in the president 's words , " modest " savings in @entity107 and @entity108			2
" i am prepared , eager and anxious to get a big deal , a big package that ends governance by crisis , " the president told @entity36 @entity16 this week in offering a bit of a @entity8 preview			1
but there is no hint of any big deal in sight , and the president himself has called for another temporary fix to push the deadline back a few months			2
it is a glaring example of @entity0 dysfunction , and the longer the stalemate goes on , the more extremes in both parties try to block the path to any grand bargain			1
conservative groups , for example , warn of retribution against @entity32 who consider giving the president any additional tax revenues , and liberal groups repeatedly are reminding newly elected democrats of their promises not to support @entity107 cuts			2
as this plays out , again , @entity36 aides talk confidently of the president 's place in the political debate			2
but even in " winning , " there could be a price			0
a crisis of confidence @entity32 pollster @entity152 notes a post-election drop in consumer confidence and says there are parallels to past battles over the debt ceiling and the fiscal cliff			0
in a consumer - driven economy , a collapse in confidence because of more @entity0 paralysis could stall an economic recovery that is critical to the president 's second term political standing			1
" economic confidence plays a key role in building the type of optimism that encourages businesses to hire and people to spend , " @entity152 writes in a presentation offering his take on what he labels " the @entity170			0
" " it is important leaders in both parties begin to recognize how the tenor , tone and outcome of the policy debates in @entity0 are actually retarding economic confidence in a way that makes building a sustained recovery more difficult			1
" what about immigration and gun laws ? question marks also can be attached to other top @entity8 priorities			1
some congressional action on immigration and gun laws seems likely , though what emerges could be significantly less than what @entity9 wants			1
immigration is the most likely source of a major package			2
but it remains a highly divisive issue , and both parties will be tested			0
the biggest question mark , perhaps , is whether the @entity37 - controlled @entity36 would pass legislation granting a path to citizenship to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the @entity207			1
and if the @entity36 passed legislation granting legal status but not full citizenship to such immigrants , would the president accept that compromise ? there is little question the president wo n't get his way in the gun control debate			2
he wants new universal background checks for gun purchases			0
more robust background checks do appear to have significant bipartisan support , but not as sweeping a plan as envisioned by the president			0
at the moment , the math is against the president when counting votes in @entity228 for his proposals to ban assault weapons and magazine cartridges that hold more than 10 rounds			0
on guns , @entity233 @entity15 sees it this way : " the president has the moral high ground but not necessarily the political high ground			1
it is still an intensity issue			0
" @entity32 @entity62 recalls how president @entity38 later regretted putting a push for @entity108 reforms ahead of immigration , an issue that , back then , had better prospects for bipartisan action			1
especially now , she says choosing priorities is critical			0
" if i were in their shoes , i would be looking to get some things done , " she said			0
" show people can work together and restore some confidence			0
" @entity15 predicts one line that will win applause across the political spectrum , in living rooms across the country if not in the @entity36 chamber : " we will be out of @entity260 in 2014			0
americans can not wait for this			0
" a more aggressive @entity9 more broadly , he sees a new @entity9 in the second act even if @entity0 's partisan polarization is a sharp as ever			1
" there is an aggressiveness to his action and a willingness to recognize that he can use his political strength either to win in policy terms or political terms or maybe both fronts , " @entity15 said			0
" bottom line : the wind is at the president 's back			0
the problems have n't changed or disappeared , but this is a more confident and politically sharp president right now			0
" not surprisingly , @entity32 see a different bottom line			0
" it 's not likely to produce much by way of legislative accomplishment , " @entity32 strategist @entity31 said of the president 's second term tone			1
" i suspect this speech will be in the rear view mirror pretty quickly			0

president @entity9 to give his first @entity8 address of his second term on *tuesday*
on the eve of speech , *gridlock* in @entity0 continues to be the biggest *obstacle*
he is expected to lay out an agenda focusing on the economy , guns , immigration
looking at other two - term presidents , this next year will be crucial to get things done
