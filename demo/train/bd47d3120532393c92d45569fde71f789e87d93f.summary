@entity0 -- when @entity5 gov. @entity4 signed some of the country 's toughest abortion restrictions into law on thursday , his state joined a growing number of those strategically pushing the limits of federal abortion rights that have been in place for 40 years			1
" in signing @entity16 today , we ... cement the culture of life , which @entity5 is built upon , " @entity4 said during the signing ceremony			0
" children do deserve the respect of simple recognition before their lives are cut tragically short			0
" his reference to the " culture of life " was no coincidence			0
nor was the bill becoming law			2
@entity4 signs abortion bill into law as the nation focused on a @entity32 takeover of the @entity33 @entity16 during the 2010 midterm elections , an even bigger conservative revolution was taking place in the states : one that , three years later , is having big implications for state legislative battles over reproductive rights			1
in 2010 , the @entity32 gained the majority of governorships , and one - fifth of the nation 's state legislatures switched to complete @entity32 control , according to data from the @entity47			1
before the 2010 election , 14 state legislatures were @entity32 - controlled			1
after those elections , the @entity32 controlled 24 statehouses , according to the data			1
the partisan shift took place in such states as @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , some of the very states that have since pushed some of the nation 's most stringent abortion regulations			1
in @entity5 , @entity4 won re-election , and @entity32 made major gains in the statehouse , which netted that party full control of state government			0
while most of the candidates ran on conservative economic rather than social platforms , such views tend to be part of " part of the candidate 's profile , " said @entity77 , director of the department of state legislation for the @entity80 organization			2
in the states , there has been a trend of gaining " support in the elections where they are electing pro-life legislators , and the legislation is passing by a greater margin , " she said			2
those gains were coupled with a concerted effort by anti-abortion groups -- which since the 1973 @entity33 @entity95 @entity94 decision had been stymied at the federal level -- to turn to the state level to push and pass legislation favorable to their cause , said @entity101 , state issues manager at the @entity102 , which supports abortion rights			1
" it was this perfect storm to enact abortion restrictions , " @entity104 said			0
new laws flout -- or use -- @entity94 provisions in restricting abortions the effects are being felt across the country			1
in @entity5 , the new law bans abortions past 20 weeks of gestation , mandates that abortion clinics become ambulatory surgical centers , tightens usage guidelines for the drug @entity118 and requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they 're providing such services			2
as it wended its way through the statehouse , the measure resulted in a high - profile showdown , and @entity131 state sen. @entity130 undertook an 11 - hour filibuster to try to block its passage			2
in @entity55 , the @entity16 passed a measure placing requirements on clinics that family planning advocates say would make it hard for them to stay in business			0
among the requirements is the presence of a doctor when an abortion is being performed			0
the bill allows @entity55 's health department to make temporary new rules for the state 's 31 abortion clinics as it sees fit and prohibits government - administered insurance plans , such as those under the @entity152 , to pay for abortions -- though it makes exceptions when a pregnancy endangers a woman 's life			1
@entity56 's @entity32 governor , @entity159 , recently signed into law a state budget that includes measures that will require ultrasounds for anyone seeking an abortion and limit abortion clinics from transferring patients to public hospitals			1
if they need more care after a procedure , patients will now have to seek out a private hospital			0
the budget will also make it more difficult for family planning groups in the @entity56 to obtain funding for preventive care			0
and it puts @entity179 behind clinics that do n't provide abortions when it comes to obtaining state funding			0
in @entity57 , a federal judge recently granted a temporary restraining order preventing the state from enforcing a new law banning doctors from performing abortions if they do n't have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 miles of their practice			2
ultimately , anti-abortion advocates hope that some of the recently passed state legislation will force the @entity95 to revisit issues addressed in @entity94			1
" i think that 's what they 're angling for ... getting the @entity95 to reconsider it , " said @entity197 , a @entity198 american government professor			2
anti-abortion groups acknowledge as much and point to such issues as the medically controversial language in several state bills stating that a fetus feels pain after 20 weeks			0
courts in several states have blocked measures containing this language			0
" if the laws were challenged and made its way to the court , we would argue the court has never looked at these issues before , " @entity77 said			0
four decades after @entity94 : a legacy of law and morality @entity1 's @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			1

states are *increasingly* passing restrictive abortion laws
increase is *due* to larger number of conservative - controlled statehouses , governorships
goal is to use possible challenge to state law to get @entity95 to revisit @entity94
