@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity3 's seemingly never - ending political careers have had a tremendous impact on at least one person : @entity7			1
the former @entity9 intern , whose sexual relationship with the 42nd president led to his impeachment , will never be able to escape the spotlight -- as long as the @entity14 are still in it			2
as @entity3 mulls another presidential run in 2016 , her husband 's relationship with @entity7 has become fodder for her political foes			1
possible @entity22 2016 presidential candidate sen. @entity21 of @entity23 has invoked @entity7 and @entity25 's affair twice in as many months			1
" if ( @entity26 ) want to take a position on women 's rights , by all means do			0
but you ca n't do it and take it from a guy who was using his position of authority to take advantage of young women in the workplace , " @entity21 said this past weekend on @entity31 's " newsmakers " program			1
and on @entity43 's " @entity42 " last month , @entity21 brought up @entity25 's " predatory behavior			1
" documents reveal @entity3 's private reaction to @entity2 's cheating scandal with @entity7 asked if @entity25 's past should be a consideration in a potential second presidential bid by his wife , @entity21 said he 's " not saying that , " but " sometimes it 's hard to separate one from the other			1
" when it comes to judging @entity25 's legacy , however , @entity21 said the affair should certainly be considered a factor			1
the conservative @entity59 first reported on public documents stored at the @entity62 library that detail some of @entity3 's discussions with a close friend , @entity64 , at the time			1
@entity25 told @entity66 that @entity7 was a " narcissistic loony toon			1
" @entity66 , who died in 2000 , wrote that " ( @entity3 ) is not trying to excuse ( @entity25 ) ; it was a huge personal lapse			1
and she is not taking responsibility for it			0
" @entity1 has confirmed the documents are authentic and has reached out to a spokesman for @entity3 , who has not responded			2
@entity7 will continue to be part of the @entity14 ' story			2
which leads us to ask -- where is she now ? immediately after @entity25 's impeachment , she remained in the spotlight			1
she worked with author @entity80 on a book about her , called " @entity82 , " which was published in march of 1999			0
she was a spokesperson for @entity83 in 1999 , according to @entity84 , and worked as an @entity86 culture reporter for @entity88 @entity87			0
she launched a handbag design line and then hosted a reality television program in 2003 called " mr. personality			0
" in the years following her @entity9 internship , she made herself available for media interviews , including with @entity94 and @entity95			0
but in 2005 , she switched gears completely			0
she moved to @entity97 , where she attended the @entity98 and graduated with a master 's degree in social psychology			0
her thesis was titled " in @entity103 : an exploration of the third person effect and pretrial publicity			0
" her publicist at the time , @entity108 , said that " the audience of students and parents erupted in spontaneous applause			0
... it was a very emotional moment for her			0
" but since 2006 , @entity7 has kept an extremely low profile			2
she stayed in @entity97 for a while job searching , and she was seen in @entity116 with friends in 2009			0
@entity108 , who no longer represents @entity7 , told @entity1 that she 's " trying to lead a private live , " but she promised that she would forward our request for comment			1
in 2012 , however , reports surfaced of a $ 12 million book deal			0
if they 're true , @entity7 's life in the shadows might come to an end			1
according to the @entity128 , she was shopping a juicy , tell - all book proposal around to publishers			0
if such a book were released soon , before 2016 , it could be the second time @entity7 has a major political impact on the @entity14			2
will @entity25 be a help or a hindrance if his wife runs for president again ?			2

nearly 20 years later , @entity7 scandal has become fodder for @entity3 's political foes
sen. @entity21 of @entity23 has invoked @entity7 and @entity25 's affair
@entity7 has remained out of the spotlight since 2005
