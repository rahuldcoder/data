@entity0 -- it 's pretty clear the @entity3 is not going to take up immigration reform this year			1
even after president @entity5 said he was willing to consider immigration legislation in pieces instead of one large bill -- which @entity3 speaker @entity9 has suggested -- just a handful of workdays remain for the @entity3 this year			1
@entity5 's concession might open the door for the @entity3 to consider the issue next year , but it 's going to take more than the president 's backing			1
and more than his personal campaigning			0

" it 's long past time to fix our broken immigration system , " he said			2
with the growing @entity31 population , the @entity29 understands it must embrace the immigration issue			2
additionally , the public supports action			0
two polls released this month show an overwhelming majority of @entity37 -- 63 % in a @entity39 survey and 57 % in a @entity41 poll -- support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants			0

this division creates a challenge for @entity50			1
their answer : maybe later			0
@entity50 strategist @entity56 told @entity1 that the timing " is just not right " and that the legislation is " not ripe and not ready			1
" here are some scenarios when the timing could be right : 1			0
when @entity61 works as long as the @entity61 is receiving negative headlines , immigration will be on the back burner			2
during a discussion last week on the @entity3 floor between majority leader @entity65 , @entity68 , and minority whip @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity65 repeatedly pivoted away from the issue of immigration to @entity61			1
" what 's going on with @entity61 right now ... i do n't think we ought to be engaging in those kinds of commitments when you ca n't deliver , " @entity65 said about bringing up immigration			2
@entity69 responded : " we understand ... you 'd like to talk about health care without talking about anything else			0
" related : @entity83 welcomes new @entity37 , slams @entity9 on immigration bill the @entity50 sees @entity61 as a winning issue politically			1
it 's a major reason it won back the @entity3 in 2010 , and the head of the @entity89 declared @entity50 will run on @entity61 in 2014			1
@entity50 are reticent to change the subject while they appear to be winning the message war			1
' the sweet spot ' the @entity3 can bring up immigration legislation in 2014 , but controversial topics are usually swept under the rug come election time			1
@entity97 said that next year , particularly the summer , might be the right time			2
" the sweet spot is to do it sometime so it 's far enough from the election so it does n't become a big issue , " she said			0
related : pro-immigration attack ads to target @entity23 in other words , do n't upset the parts of the base that are anti-immigration but appeal to the majority of @entity37 who support an overhaul of the immigration system			2
the former could be prove more tricky as @entity50 have to take into consideration primary voters and the possibility of primary challengers			2
some factions of the @entity29 are against any bill that includes a path to citizenship or legal residency for undocumented immigrants , which they see as amnesty			2
for instance , @entity125 , a lobbying and campaign arm of the conservative @entity128 think tank , worked to get @entity25 @entity50 to vote against the immigration bill last spring			1
immigration is not considered a top - tier issue , but @entity50 do risk backlash			1
sen. @entity135 , @entity136 , said he regretted his vote on comprehensive immigration reform that included a path to citizenship and that passed in the @entity25 this year			2
he helped to draft the bill			2
@entity143 , executive director of @entity144 , a pro-immigration group involved in pushing legislation through the @entity3 , said the @entity50 leadership is considering the stances of immigration opponents			1
" @entity9 and company seem a bit more concerned with tea party types ... more concerned with their conservative members who could face ouster , " @entity143 said			0
if the @entity3 waits long enough next year to bring up immigration , it would be too late for immigration to be an issue in the primaries and , perhaps more importantly , too late for challengers to jump in the race and make it an issue			1
feelings must be mended @entity164 , a @entity50 strategist who has worked on immigration for nearly two decades , said it is a must - pass issue for the @entity50 to stay a relevant political party at the national level			1
but she said " a hostile political environment " is the biggest factor in prohibiting immigration legislation			1
related : shutdown threat imperils immigration reform the recent government shutdown was perhaps a low point during an already perilous time in @entity0			0
the trust factor between the two parties plummeted			0
rep. @entity178 , @entity179 , refused to attend a meeting at the @entity181 to discuss immigration , calling it a " trap			0
" " the shutdown was very toxic			0
right now , it 's very difficult , " said @entity97 , the @entity50 strategist			1
and @entity187 , executive director of the @entity188 , said few lawmakers from opposite parties are talking to each other			0
" i just think the lines of communication between the parties have really broken down , " @entity187 said			0
when @entity50 proponents outweigh opponents another problem inhibiting an immigration bill is lack of incentives for @entity50 lawmakers to stick their necks out			1
" republicans have not gotten to yes , " @entity143 said			0
and until they do , @entity9 is reluctant to bring a bill to the floor			0
" i do n't think they will bring it up until they can get it passed , " @entity97 said , highlighting that @entity9 is reluctant to bring a bill to the floor that would pass with mostly @entity210 support			0
one immigration proposal similar to the @entity25 version has the support of 190 lawmakers , a handful of whom are republicans			0
rep. @entity222 , a @entity50 from an agricultural region of @entity224 , is one of the bill 's co-sponsors			1
he said there are at least six more republicans who support the bill but have n't come out publicly yet			0
but that 's far short of a majority			0
to get more on board , a coalition of " bibles , business and badges " -- representing key constituencies -- is attempting to use its influence to pressure @entity50			2

now that @entity9 said there will be not bill this year , @entity50 have little reason to put their name on legislation that could be politically disadvantageous			1
" the biggest challenge of this bill is there is not a deadline , " @entity222 said			0
" that 's part of the reason this continues to get pushed			0

the @entity3 will not take up immigration legislation this year
a bill is " not ripe and not ready , " a @entity50 strategist says
but @entity50 leaders keep the door open for next year
