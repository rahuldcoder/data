-- the husband of one of the members of @entity5 punk rock band @entity4 imprisoned for hooliganism in @entity7 is leading a chorus of condemnation after a conviction decried as an attack on free speech			1
three young women , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , were sentenced to two years in prison friday after being convicted of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred			1
they were arrested after performing a song critical of president @entity21 in one of the @entity24 's most important cathedrals in february , a flash mob - style act that outraged many of the country 's faithful			1
@entity4 supporters vent anger at @entity32 footage of the brief but provocative protest action , in which the band members clad in balaclavas screamed " @entity38 , please drive @entity21 away , " inside @entity39 attracted wide attention after it was posted online			1
the sentence handed down to the trio was widely condemned by rights groups and senior international figures as disproportionate , although polling suggests many in @entity5 believe they had a fair trial			0
@entity48 , husband of @entity14 , told @entity0 's @entity49 that legal experts had assured him while the women might have been arrested for their action elsewhere in the world , they would not have gone to prison for it			1
" this would never happen in any @entity58 country , it 's just not possible , " he said			1
@entity48 said the authorities had crossed " a certain line " in arresting the women for a nonviolent protest act -- and that this was the reason for the international outcry over the case , with celebrities including @entity64 backing their cause			1
" everyone was amazed that @entity21 decided to give this brutal sentence to girls for singing a protest song inside a church -- no one was expecting that , " he said			2
he said there had been no time to say goodbye as his wife -- who is also mother to their young child -- was taken from the courtroom to start her prison term			1
@entity4 and @entity5 's surreal ' justice ' " right after the girls heard the verdict , we only had a couple of glances , for five seconds , and that was it			1
she was led away by all these numerous guards in the court room and we could n't speak to each other , " he said			0
@entity48 's criticisms echo international concern that the sentence , although handed down by a court , may have been politically motivated and reflects a recent crackdown on free speech by @entity5 's authorities			1
@entity103 spokesman @entity102 also said the @entity104 was " disappointed " by the verdict and sentence			2
" while we understand the group 's behavior was offensive to some , we have serious concerns about the way that these young women have been treated by the @entity5 judicial system , " he said			2
@entity115 foreign policy chief @entity114 condemned the court 's decision as " deeply troubling			0
" " together with the reports of the band members ' mistreatment during their pre-trial detention and the reported irregularities of the trial , it puts a serious question mark over @entity5 's respect for international obligations of fair , transparent and independent legal process , " she said			0
" it also runs counter to @entity5 's international obligations as regards to respect for freedom of expression			0
" urging @entity5 to reverse the sentence , @entity134 said the case " adds to the recent upsurge in politically motivated intimidation and prosecution of opposition activists in the @entity5 , a trend that is of growing concern to the @entity115			0
" rights group @entity143 said that the court 's decision was " a bitter blow for freedom of expression in the country " and that the women were now " prisoners of conscience			0
" @entity143 believes that the women 's conduct " was politically motivated , and that they were wrongfully prosecuted for what was a legitimate -- if potentially offensive -- protest action , " it said in a statement			1
@entity156 also said the women should never have been prosecuted for a hate crime			0
inside the courtroom , judge @entity159 found the three @entity4 members guilty of offending the churchgoers present -- through their actions , obscene language and their clothing -- and showing a lack of respect for the rules of the @entity24			2
polling by the @entity169 indicates that many people within @entity5 support the legal proceedings against the three women			0
its poll , conducted before the sentence was handed down , found that 44 % of people surveyed thought the trial was fair , while 17 % thought it was n't fair and 39 % said they did n't know			0
@entity48 said the survey 's findings reflect the dominance of state media , particularly in areas of @entity5 where access to the @entity185 is limited			2
this made it easy to turn people against the band by portraying it as @entity190 , anti-russian values and revolutionary , he said			0
@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 have spent five months in pre-trial detention , which counts toward their two - year term			1
they are expected to appeal the court 's decision -- but @entity48 said he did not think they would request a presidential pardon			2
" my wife has already answered this question -- ' it 's not us who should be asking @entity21 for pardon , it 's @entity21 who should be asking for a pardon from us and the whole country , ' " he cites her as saying .			0

@entity48 says no other @entity58 nation would have jailed his wife for the protest act
the @entity103 has serious concerns about the women 's treatment , a spokesmen says
the three members of @entity4 got a two - year prison term for hooliganism
they were arrested after performing an @entity227 song in a cathedral as a protest act
