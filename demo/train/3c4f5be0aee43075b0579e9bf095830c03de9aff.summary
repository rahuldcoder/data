@entity0 -- one of the most well - known sports franchises in the world is facing a lawsuit over its famous logo			2
a @entity7 , @entity0 , woman is suing the @entity8 for trademark infringement , claiming her uncle created the @entity8 top hat logo but never got paid for his work			1
in a complaint filed in @entity15 , @entity13 claims her uncle @entity16 was a graphic designer commissioned in 1936 to create a logo for the @entity8			1
@entity13 says former @entity8 owners @entity19 and @entity20 heard of @entity16 's work from his sister , who worked in @entity23 as a manicurist in the 1930s			2
@entity16 , who lived in @entity26 at the time , created a logo that incorporated a top hat and bat similar to the one now used by the team			0
@entity13 says the logo has @entity16 's established signature " p , " which appeared on his other artwork			0
according to the complaint , @entity13 took the logos to @entity36 , a design analyst -- who concluded it to be " evident that they are so significantly similar that they could not have been created independently from one another			0
" @entity13 explains that her uncle was not aware that the @entity8 adopted the logo until he immigrated to @entity42 in 1947 and was asked to revise the logo for their 1952 celebration of 50 years based in @entity0			1
she claims @entity16 was hopeful that this time the sports franchise would offer him some kind of recognition , but took the opportunity to " sign " his work with a " @entity52 " instead of 1903 to 1952 , the logo appears as " @entity53 " on the patches of the uniform			0
@entity56 , spokesperson for the @entity8 , said they have n't been served with the lawsuit			1
" this is a wonderful country where anybody can sue for anything , even when the allegations are over 70 years old , " she said			0
@entity13 says that because of scarce resources and trust in @entity8 owners , her uncle never got a lawyer and did not copyright his work , but in 1960 he lost his confidence in the team and passed on the fight to her , in hopes she would pursue the claims .			2
