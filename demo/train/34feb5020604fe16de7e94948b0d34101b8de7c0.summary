" the action comes nearly a year after the @entity34 @entity33 announced it was investigating 55 colleges and universities , including @entity15 , for violations pertaining to @entity38 , the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination on college campuses			2
@entity15 responded at the time by saying it had appointed its first ever @entity38 officer , and that the school 's president " recently announced the creation of a university - wide task force -- composed of faculty , students and staff -- that will recommend how we can better prevent sexual misconduct at @entity15			2
" the new policy is the result of " a formal process to review @entity15 's @entity38 policy , " the school said .			0

@entity15 bans all romantic relationships between professors and students
