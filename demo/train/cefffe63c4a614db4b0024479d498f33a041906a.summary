-- people who take vitamin e supplements regularly for years -- whether they are smokers or nonsmokers -- may lower their risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , the lung condition that is the fourth leading cause of death in the @entity8			1
@entity9 includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is often , but not always , caused by smoking			1
while the risk reduction is relatively small , 10 percent , @entity9 is a common and life - threatening condition in which a decline in lung function can be slowed down but not reversed			1
@entity9 symptoms include shortness of breath , coughing , and fatigue			2
" the effect appears to be modest			0
but for something for which there is n't really any effective therapy and tends to be a degenerative condition , anything that would reduce the risk even somewhat is not an insubstantial benefit , " says @entity21 , @entity22 , a professor of nutrition at @entity24 in @entity25 who was not involved in the study			0
the research , from the government - funded @entity35 , included 39,876 women 45 years and older who were free of @entity9 before they were randomly assigned to take a placebo , vitamin e supplements ( 600 @entity41 every other day ) or aspirin ( 100 mg per day ) , either alone or in combination			2
at the end of 10 years , 760 of the 19,937 women who took vitamin e alone or with aspirin developed @entity9 compared with 846 of the 19,939 who took a placebo or aspirin alone -- a 10 percent risk reduction			1
@entity52 did not lower the risk of asthma , a condition associated with a higher risk of @entity9			1
@entity0 : 10 ways to have cleaner air at home the researchers took into account factors such as cigarette smoking and age , which can affect @entity9 risk			1
the study , conducted by @entity66 and @entity68 researchers , is to be presented this week at the annual @entity70 meeting in @entity71			0
the idea that vitamin e can reduce the risk of developing @entity9 is " biologically plausible , " says @entity75 , @entity22 , an associate professor in the department of epidemiology and public health at @entity79			1
experts believe vitamins a , @entity82 , and e -- the so - called @entity85 antioxidants -- combat oxidative stress in the lungs that can lead to @entity9			1
@entity0 : eight causes of a chronic cough several studies have shown that these vitamins , as well as vitamin d , may help improve lung health			1
in a 2003 study , @entity75 and her collaborators found that men and women with diets high in vitamins @entity82 and @entity52 had greater lung capacity and produced less phlegm , respectively			1
phlegm production and wheezing are also @entity9 symptoms			2
one limitation of the study is that the researchers relied on the women to report whether or not they had a diagnosis of @entity9 , says @entity111 , @entity112 , an assistant professor in the pulmonary critical care division at the @entity114			1
he points out that people with asthma may think they have @entity9 , or vice versa , since the symptoms are similar			2
in addition , early diagnoses can be inconclusive or due to lung problems that do n't turn out to be @entity9			1
@entity0 : how to buy the right air cleaner in future studies , @entity111 says that the researchers should diagnose @entity9 using a breathing test called spirometry			1
" if you showed in a similar study with a gold standard outcome [ like spirometry ] , among smokers and nonsmokers , that you could affect the incidence of @entity9 , i would imagine the committees that meet on this would take a serious look at increasing daily recommended intake [ of vitamin e ] for the general population , " he says			1
currently , no vitamin supplements are recommended to prevent or treat @entity9			0
the best way to prevent the disease is to quit smoking , says dr. @entity111			0
about 24 million people in the @entity8 have @entity9 -- 12 million who 've been diagnosed with the disease and another 12 million who have copd but do n't know they have it			2
in the study , women who smoked were four times more likely than nonsmokers to develop @entity9			2
@entity0 : 12 best copd blogs and web sites the daily recommended intake of vitamin e is about 22 international units for those 14 and older , and is relatively easy to obtain from oils such as sunflower , almonds , peanut butter , and spinach			0
the vitamin e intake in the study was far higher , at 300 @entity41 per day			0
however , @entity21 says this is within the range of most over-the - counter vitamin supplements , which deliver 100 or 400 @entity41 daily			0
" this study is still five times below the highest dose at which no adverse effect has been found , " he says			0
vitamin e intake is generally a concern only at very high doses , above 1500 @entity41 per day			0
several studies have suggested that these levels promote hemorrhaging and interfere with normal blood clotting			0
for this reason , high doses of vitamin e are not recommended for people taking blood - thinners such as warfarin ( @entity184 ) and aspirin			0
@entity0 : eight breathing tips for people with @entity9 for people concerned about their lung health , taking vitamin e and @entity82 is not a bad idea , says @entity21			1
" if i were talking to somebody who was a former smoker and who was concerned about minimizing their risk of not only lung disease but also heart disease and cancer , then taking a supplement of @entity82 would be a reasonable thing to do , " he says			1
in fact , anyone who thought he or she was at increased risk of @entity9 could potentially benefit from these supplements , he adds			2
supplements of beta - carotene , which is a precursor of the antioxidant vitamin a , should be used with caution , however			0
while a 2006 @entity213 study found that people with diets high in beta - carotene had a slower decline in lung function over an eight - year period , heavy smokers and drinkers may not benefit			0
two studies found that beta - carotene supplements increased the risk of lung cancer in people who smoked more than one pack a day and drank heavily			2
according to @entity111 , the new study offers an incentive to look closer at the potential to use vitamin e or other antioxidants to help prevent @entity9			0
" if it could be done with something like vitamin e , that 's a relatively low - risk intervention , that would be the @entity235			0

@entity240 can cut chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk in smokers and nonsmokers
@entity9 includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis ; often , but not always , caused by smoking
several studies have shown that vitamins a , @entity82 , @entity52 and @entity251 may help improve lung health
