-- when the @entity2 upheld the @entity3 in a 5 - 4 ruling thursday , the @entity1 was quick to release a statement in support of the " historic " decision that will give more people access to health coverage			1
but ( and there 's always a " but " ) medical professionals across the country are wondering : when an additional 32 million @entity13 get medical insurance , who exactly is going to treat them ? " we 've expressed some concerns before about whether or not we 're going to have enough physicians out there , " @entity1 president - @entity16 said			1
they have good reason to worry			2
when @entity22 enacted the " 30 - bhat scheme " in 2002 , requiring all patients to be covered by health insurance , 14 million people were added to the country 's health care system			2
the result was longer waits at the doctor 's office and complaints of subpar service			2
8 countries that have universal health care a physician shortage in the @entity13 was expected even before the @entity3 was signed into law in 2010 , according to the @entity38			1
now the group estimates that there will be a shortage of 63,000 doctors by 2015 and 130,600 by 2025			1
the shortage is a result of several factors			1
a large number of medical professionals are reaching retirement age , as is a large group of patients : nearly 15 million will become eligible for @entity51 in the coming years , the @entity38 reports			2
on top of that , there is a lack of residency spots available for students graduating from medical school			1
in 2011 , more than 7,000 were left with degrees that said " @entity60 " but no place to continue their education , according to the @entity64			2
why your waiter has an @entity60 many residency spots are funded by @entity51 , and there 's a cap on the number a hospital can claim each year			1
that number , about 100,000 , has remained steady since 1997			0
while the @entity3 will redistribute some unused residency slots and increase funding for the @entity75 , more needs to be done , advocates say			1
" there will be real physician shortages if we do n't do more to lift the residency cap , " said dr. @entity76 , the @entity38 ' chief advocacy officer , in a statement			1
" people on both sides of the aisle have realized the need to train more doctors			1
" opinion : we do n't need more doctors the biggest scarcity will be in primary - care physicians , @entity16 said , thanks to better insurance coverage for preventative care			1
" i would like to note that these are not newly appeared patients , " she said			0
" they 've been in emergency rooms , for things that are not necessarily an emergency			0
it 's going to be a reshuffling of where they get their care and when they get their care			0
" this , of course , is a good thing , @entity16 said			0
doctors will be able to detect diseases earlier and focus on wellness , which in turn might lower health care costs			1
but that will require more internists , ob / gyns and pediatricians -- at a time when many private practices are struggling to stay afloat financially			0
nurses would be a perfect fit to handle the increase in preventative medicine practices , said registered nurse @entity125 , president of the @entity126			0
nursing 's holistic approach focuses on wellness and community - based health needs			0
unfortunately , @entity13 has been talking about the nation 's nursing shortage since the early 2000s , and the numbers have n't improved			2
" we 're going to be facing serious shortages unlike anything we 've ever seen in the next decade , " @entity135 said			2
the @entity126 was a staunch supporter of the @entity3 , and the group wrote a brief in support of the legislation			0
even if it 's not a perfect law , @entity135 said , there are several important protections that have been put in place , protections that will give access to millions who otherwise might have avoided care			0
but , there 's always a " but			0
" " this is going to have to be a system that , in order to be effective , is going to have to be able to meet demands for the work force			0
we need more resources to provide more access			0
