-- a year ago , football 's finances seemed to be healthier than ever , bucking the trend of global economic hardship			1
the total @entity6 market had ballooned to a staggering $ 20.76 billion by the end of the 2007 - 8 season , and clubs -- especially in @entity10 -- splashed out big in the january 2009 transfer market , with the @entity12 responsible for a record - breaking $ 252 million in player purchases			2
@entity16 big - spenders @entity15 , incredibly , then beat that @entity10 figure on their own in the off - season			0
recession ? who 's buying that			2
but this month 's transfer @entity23 looks like being a much more somber affair			0
some big , big clubs are trying to stave off some big , big problems			0
even given those rosy - looking figures of 2007 - 08 , the most recent available , @entity29 's top clubs then still owed more than $ 6 billion according to a study by football finance expert @entity32 , an accounting professor at the @entity33			1
" clubs are getting deeper and deeper into the mire of enormous debt , and along with overvalued assets and costs that far outstrip income levels , this is the biggest of football 's ills , " @entity32 said in his report			2
when reports start circulating that an outfit as big as @entity46 , regularly near the top of @entity49 's list of football 's wealthiest clubs , are considering refinancing some $ 960 million of debt with a bond issue , then you know that something is up			1
the @entity56 family saddled @entity46 with huge debts with their 2005 takeover , and the @entity59 also have outstanding personal sums owed on the deal which have since increased by $ 64 million , according to @entity64 's @entity63 newspaper			1
with @entity6 ruling body @entity29 planning to bring in new rules governing debt and ownership from 2012 which mean clubs can not spend more than they earn , the pressure is on to find a safe financial footing			0
@entity73 's billionaire owner @entity72 responded last week by converting the $ 540 million he has given the @entity10 club in interest - free loans into equity			1
and it 's not just in @entity78 where clubs , also including the @entity59 - owned @entity80 , are battling to stay afloat in a sea of debt -- said to be around $ 4.3 billion for the whole of the @entity12 , according to the @entity84			1
@entity86 giants @entity85 plan big wage cuts , according to @entity64 's @entity89 newspaper , and may be forced to sell star asset @entity90 , long a target of @entity15 , @entity46 and @entity73			1
" we are going to try to reduce the wages , " the @entity95 club 's director of sport @entity96 said			2
" the wages have gone through the roof and , therefore , we have got to get our message through to the players that a new contract does not necessarily mean a pay rise			0
" @entity106 club @entity104 has been put into liquidation after being expelled from the @entity108 on december 28 for failing to meet financial obligations , with debts of $ 1.15 million , ending 87 years of existence			1
while clubs such as @entity46 and @entity80 incurred vast debts when they were taken over by new owners , player wages have long been a major item on the expenses side of the balance sheet			2
@entity119 have become the poster club of failed payments in recent times , on tuesday failing to pay their players ' wages for the fourth time this season			2
the @entity10 outfit is riddled with debt following two takeovers in the past six months , with former owner @entity130 claiming that he is still owed some $ 45 million in loans and the @entity64 tax department issuing a winding - up notice over unpaid debts			1
" these chaps knew what they were getting			0
they must have realized there is a wage bill and the tax bill to meet every month			1
there are no surprises , " @entity130 told the www.fansonline.net web site			0
the @entity12 has also been forced to take action , diverting @entity119 's latest $ 11 million in television money to @entity73 , @entity146 and @entity147 -- who are all owed sums by the struggling club for player transfers			1
and the problem is not restricted to the upper echelons of the @entity10 game , whose only big - spenders this month may be @entity73 and @entity157 , owned by @entity159 oil billionaire @entity158			0
second division @entity160 , bankrolled by millionaire @entity161 , have failed to make wage payments to players on time for the past two months , and four times in the last year			0
lower league club @entity166 were saved from oblivion in july by the @entity169 group , who promised to take the world 's oldest side into the @entity12 with a massive cash injection and the expensive acquisition of former @entity78 manager @entity175 as director of football			1
but that has fallen by the wayside with @entity179 selling to chairman @entity180 for a nominal fee , and the club again faces an uncertain future with a second winding - up order from the tax man , though @entity175 apparently remains committed to his post			0
@entity188 clubs were last year forced to accept a far less lucrative replacement deal from @entity190 and @entity191 following the collapse of @entity195 broadcaster @entity193 , highlighting how precarious the existence of some leagues is			0
" the economy of football is not an exception to the rule of economics , " @entity32 said			0
" if one major sponsorship or television deal collapses , the clubs will sink			0
