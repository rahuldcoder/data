let 's start with some statistics : @entity2 has the highest rate of reported rape in the country at three times the national average			1
an estimated 59 % of adult women there suffer from sexual or intimate partner violence , according to a statewide survey published in 2010			1
and 37 % suffer from sexual violence			2
there are many reasons why that 's the case , as i detailed in a recent series on rape in @entity2 for @entity19 's @entity21 project			2
but here 's a factor i did n't really consider until readers brought it to my attention : @entity2 does n't require sex education			1
given the rates of violence , that 's puzzling and negligent -- especially since programs that teach kids about healthy relationships , child sex abuse and dating violence have been proved effective in evaluation studies			1
a bill proposed by @entity2 rep. @entity38 , a @entity39 from @entity40 , would be a good place to start changing these policies			2
called @entity48 , after an @entity46 victim of child sexual abuse , and based on a national movement , the bill would require school districts in @entity2 to teach warning signs for child sexual abuse			1
" if we really want to change the outlook and the trajectory going ahead 10 , 20 , 30 years , we really need to be going in and working with the kids , " @entity38 told me in a phone interview			0
makes sense , right ? the state also should consider broader legislation to include requirements for students to learn about sex , dating violence and safe relationships			2
sexual violence in some @entity2 communities i visited is so common that it starts to be normalized			1
if young people grow up in a violent home , where women are valued less than men , then there 's little reason to expect them to break the cycle			0
" it 's so normal to them , " one student in southwest @entity2 told me			2
" it could be their mother -- being ashamed ( of being abused ) -- and it 's so normal to you that you just become that			0
you because the abused or the abuser			0
it can go back and forth			0
" teachers and schools can and should intervene			0
some school districts in @entity2 are doing a commendable job of bringing up these uncomfortable issues and preparing students to end the violence , but none of the programs is required			1
@entity2 is part of a relatively small minority of states that does not require school districts to teach a form of sex or health education , said @entity102 , a policy expert at the @entity103			1
state statutes say " each district in the state public school system shall be encouraged ( emphasis mine ) to initiate and conduct a program in health education for kindergarten through grade 12 ... " encouraged but not required			2
school districts decide individually if and how they want to teach these sensitive subjects			1
one effective program , called " @entity116 " for " relationships , " encourages students to participate in role - playing exercises and other forms of learning			1
the program , which was developed in @entity123 and includes about 20 lessons , has been shown to lead to " reductions in dating violence " and " significantly fewer violent acts towards peers , " said @entity129 , an education specialist at the @entity130			2
but only 22.2 % of schools in @entity2 are using the voluntary program , said @entity133 , director of the @entity134 on @entity135 and @entity136			1
that 's up from 9.7 % in 2011 , but it 's still not enough			0
a federal grant helps pay for the program , @entity139 said			0
the @entity142 teaches sex education and healthy relationships , and some school districts , such as one in @entity147 , have developed curriculum in collaboration with local women 's rights advocates , according to @entity133			1
there are also encouraging programs such as @entity153 in @entity154			0
it 's an afterschool program to help young people connect with traditional culture and learn how to lead healthy and violence - free lives			2
i met some students in that program on my trip to the state in december , and they raved about its impact			0
most kids in that town are n't in the @entity153 program , though			0
it 's @entity133 's view that @entity2 's school districts should choose to teach these programs -- because they will be implemented more powerfully and wholeheartedly if they do			1
she wants to see this info taught , but she wants it to be voluntary			0
maybe there 's something about @entity2 's pioneer spirit that compels this opt - in approach			0
but it 's clear rates of violence remain unacceptably high under the voluntary system			1
perhaps change should come in the form of a mandate that all school districts in @entity2 teach about sex abuse and healthy relationships			1
@entity38 's bill would be a good start			0
or maybe there are other incentive structures to convince more schools that health and sex education are n't just optional , they 're essential			1
i asked some students who participate in the @entity153 program in @entity154 what they thought should be done to curb the state 's high rates of violence against women			1
the answer was obvious to them			0
" people need to know about it , " one person said			0
and another : " realize it 's there			0
" i hope the legislature will uncover its ears .			0

@entity2 does not require school districts to teach sex ed
@entity218 : given high rates of violence against women , it should
@entity218 says the some districts implement progress curriculum , but many do n't
one effective program is only used by 22.2 % of schools , for example
