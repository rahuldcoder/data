when @entity3 's @entity2 system defeated the human champion on " @entity5 ! " in february 2011 , it surprised the world with its unprecedented command of a vast array of facts , puns , and clever questions			1
but how will that feat change our lives over the next decade ? what does it mean for the future of intelligent machines ? @entity2 accumulated its wide - ranging knowledge by " reading " the equivalent of millions of books , foreshadowing a revolution in how computers acquire , analyze , and create knowledge			1

here are five ways we predict the @entity42 will change your life in the coming decade : 1			1
being a scientific assistant : by 2020 , machine reading and understanding of scientific text has the potential to accelerate breakthroughs like helping find new cures to diseases or solutions to climate change			1
the @entity57 's @entity56 project is building software that will enable computers to " learn " from textbooks , ask questions , and draw tentative conclusions			2
building on this , and related projects like @entity2 , this kind of assistant will become an indispensable tool for scientists and researchers			1

answering questions : when you ask your smartphone a specific question like " when 's the next flight to @entity77 ? " or even " what 's president @entity80 's current approval rating ? " you 'll be able to receive direct and concise answers on your device			1
programs like @entity71 and @entity84 now can already answer spoken questions like " when 's the next @entity87 game ? " over the coming decade , the range of answerable questions will broaden substantially , and the answers will be based not only on databases of facts , but also on information automatically extracted and synthesized from news , web pages , and tweets			2
thus ( as @entity96 anticipated in 2011 ) : on our phones , ten blue links will gradually become a thing of the past			1
being an online shopping concierge : we foresee an automated concierge that makes personalized product recommendations based on your tastes and reading all available reviews on the @entity108			0
today , if you want to find a quiet hotel in mid-town @entity111 , you may be forced to spend hours combing through hotel reviews to figure out which ones are relevant , authentic , and informative			1

research prototypes like @entity118 and @entity96 's @entity119 have already shown that computers can read and analyze reviews with high accuracy			1
it 's only a matter of time before shopping excursions are truly one - click endeavors			2
acting as an automated medical assistant : imagine getting an immediate " second opinion " based on the latest medical studies and experiments right in your doctor 's office , or even in the comfort of home			1
today , any doctor is overwhelmed by the deluge of new medical studies and discoveries			0
by 2023 , your doctor will have a tireless medical assistant who keeps up with the scientific literature on his or her behalf , and warns against potential errors such as unnoticed drug interactions , dangerous side effects , and more			0
delivering real - time statistics : within a decade , authoritative statistics on health , inflation , and unemployment will be available in real - time , benefiting both policy makers and the general public			0
read more : the best @entity154 jokes about @entity156 's drones today , we often find out about the outbreak of epidemics , health hazards , and economic concerns long after the fact			2
yet status updates on social media can reveal important clues about our location , community health , and even employment status immediately			0
research is underway to anticipate epidemics and address other public health questions that today are studied via surveys and slower , less - inclusive methods			0
@entity173 reports on research to monitor food poisoning outbreaks in @entity176 , @entity178 researchers are computing analogous statistics for unemployment , and the @entity181 at @entity182 provides far richer inflation measurements than the government 's official index			0
in the near future , approximations to official data will be available instantaneously			0
read more : forget flying cars , check out these flying robots we recently launched the @entity57 ( @entity192 ) in @entity193 to carry out basic research in the area of machine reading and understanding of text , which will enable the broader community to pursue the above innovations			0
within a decade , computer knowledge acquired from " @entity202 " will be available at any time , any place , and accessible via a dialog that would make the @entity206 proud and put @entity71 to shame			0
as @entity208 observed in 2011 , the singularity is far beyond the horizon , but the @entity210 is coming to a mobile device near you .			1

@entity3 's @entity2 system defeated the human champion on " @entity5 ! " in february 2011 *--* surprising the world
but that feat was a *precursor* to what is being called a " @entity210 , " which is underway now
