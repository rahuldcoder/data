signing up for @entity0 has become a part - time job for @entity2			1
starting the minute healthcare.gov went live october 1 , @entity3 spent five to six hours a day trying to make the site work before she finally managed to enroll two weeks later			2
she faced error messages and blank screens			0
the green twirly " please wait " circle literally haunted her dreams			0
" there were days that i would just completely lose my temper with it , " she remembers			0
" i 'd want to just slam my laptop down			0
" but @entity3 kept with it because she needs insurance -- badly			1
she suffers from depression , sleep apnea and thyroid problems , and her daughter has @entity23 's syndrome			0
she was " immediately relieved " when she signed up on healthcare.gov because before @entity0 , no insurance companies would take them with their pre-existing conditions			2
their medical bills totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars and ate up the family 's life savings , and the @entity3 declared bankruptcy earlier this year			1
@entity34 homepage gets makeover " i wanted the coverage , and i was bound and determined to get it , " @entity3 said from her @entity37 home			1
but will everyone else -- especially healthy people -- be determined enough to stick with healthcare.gov ? will they spend five hours a day trying to make a website work when they are n't motivated by mounting medical bills ? @entity47 administration officials have said they need about 2.7 million young , healthy people to sign up -- and that they fully expect them to join at the very last minute			1
without those healthy people , @entity0 could be in trouble , since an insurance pool only works well when healthy people , who pay premiums but use few services , are in it to help offset the costs of people like @entity3 and her daughter			1
" it 's incredibly important to have young people in the ( insurance ) exchanges in the long term , " said @entity58 , a vice president at @entity59 , a healthcare strategy group			2
" and the glitches on the website do n't help the situation at all			0
" eventually -- hopefully -- healthcare.gov will become a workable site			0
but some worry that even then , the website will have been branded as problematic and time - consuming , and some healthy people will prefer to pay the fine for being uninsured , which in many cases is significantly lower than the cost of buying insurance			1
official : @entity0 website ' fixable ' by end of november " is that perception of this flawed website going to stick with the public , or is it something that can be gotten over ? " asked @entity82 , a partner at @entity83 , which does surveying and marketing to young people about health care			2
" if it sticks , that 's going to be a problem			0

@entity2 made it her *mission* to sign up on @entity34
@entity3 and her family badly needed insurance
but will young , healthy people go to such trouble ?
