-- how do you know if your @entity3 video is funny ? @entity4 says you can start by counting the " lols			1
" always fond of an ambitious algorithm , @entity4 , which owns the @entity7 's top video - sharing site , has set out to try to determine scientifically which videos are the funniest , and what makes them so			1
there 's a certain irony to the degree of wonkish jargon needed to explain the things that make us laugh in a blog post from @entity19 , a @entity4 researcher and member of the web giant 's amusingly titled " @entity21			1
" he said identifying , and ranking , comedy is harder than a previous @entity4 music project			2
" we noticed a few audiovisual patterns across comedy videos on @entity3 , such as shaky camera motion or audible laughter , which we can automatically detect , " @entity19 wrote on the @entity27			1
" while content - based features worked well for music , identifying humor based on just such features is @entity36			2
humor preference is subjective , perhaps even more so than musical taste			1
" and , in a way , that 's the thing with humor , is n't it ? who can say , for example , whether the @entity45 is funnier than a guy on a buffalo ? what 's worth a bigger laugh -- snooty @entity51 actors reciting lines from " @entity53 , " or the @entity54 ? so how does the rating process work ? first , @entity4 's speech - recognition technology lets it scan videos for cues such as laughter			1
also factored in are key words the uploader uses in the video 's description ( " funny , " " hilarious , " etc. ) and language viewers use in that video 's comments section			2
so if people type " @entity68 ! @entity68 ! @entity68 ! " ( or cultural equivalents such as " jajaja " or " kekeke " ) , that earns a point in the video 's favor			0
same for webspeak such as " lol " or " @entity76			0
" then the algorithm kicks in			0
it awards extra credit when people put extra emphasis in their responses			0
so , an " @entity84 " is worth more than an " lol , " and the more exclamation points , the better			0
hah ! ! ! ! ! @entity4 's coders taught the algorithm how to use that information to rank the site 's videos			1
or , in @entity19 's delightful jargon : " we then trained a passive - aggressive ranking algorithm using human - annotated pairwise ground truth and a combination of text and audiovisual features			2
" got it ? the final step is where you come in			0
top - ranked videos have made it into what @entity4 is calling its " @entity103			1
" users see two videos @entity106 and vote on which they think is funnier			2
so far , 75,000 people have cast 700,000 votes , @entity19 said			0
he did n't mention when results might be announced			0
when the " slam " is done , maybe we 'll finally know -- which is funnier , the @entity114 or " @entity115			0

@entity4 has created an algorithm that scores videos based on user *feedback* , other info
users can vote on @entity3 's top finishers in a " @entity103 "
