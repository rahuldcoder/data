-- for the first time in over five years , a run of more than 300 competitive matches , @entity1 had less possession than the opposition			1
for this to happen against an also - ran in the @entity9 league was some surprise , but for @entity12 it was no big deal			2
after all , the @entity1 team that he took charge of in july still notched a fifth successive @entity17 win , beating @entity18 4 - 0 on saturday as @entity19 grabbed a hat - trick			1
but it does herald a change in approach for a team whose intricate style of " @entity27 " passing has made it one of the most successful clubs in world football -- a success mirrored and surpassed on the international stage by @entity32			0
the numbers were n't startlingly one - sided -- @entity1 had 49 % of the ball compared to the home side 's 51 % -- but it was a big drop from the stats so customary under the guidance of previous coaches @entity40 and @entity41			1
@entity12 , however , is his own man -- and he is trying to put in place a " @entity46 " when in the past it looked like the reigning @entity9 champion had none			2
" @entity18 pressed us and they made it difficult to play short passes			0
we had the alternative to play long and at times you have to do this in these types of matches in order reach other parts of the field , " the @entity51 said			0
" i really liked the team in the second half			0
we did n't have defensive errors and , like the match against @entity65 , we improved over the course of the match			0
we have the capacity to score a lot of goals			0
" @entity19 was the main beneficiary of @entity1 's firepower , being set up by midweek hat - trick hero @entity72 , @entity73 and then @entity74 to take his league tally to five this season			1
@entity73 wrapped it up in the 80th minute with a sumptuous strike , but keeper @entity79 also made a vital contribution against second - bottom @entity18 as he saved a first - half penalty soon after @entity19 's opener			1
" @entity79 is playing at a fantastic level and all i can do is enjoy it as his manager			0
he had decisive saves and he saved a penalty , " @entity12 said			0
the win put @entity1 top on goal difference , as @entity92 also notched a fifth straight win in saturday 's late match			1
second - half goals from @entity96 and @entity97 earned a 2 - 0 victory at @entity99 , putting the top two teams five points clear ahead of sunday 's games -- when @entity103 hosts @entity104 and @entity105 travels to @entity106			1
in saturday 's other games , @entity107 drew 0 - 0 at @entity109 and @entity110 came from two goals down to earn a 2 - 2 draw at @entity113 after the home side had @entity115 sent off for two bookings in a minute			1
in @entity118 , @entity117 moved out of the bottom three with a 2 - 1 win at home to @entity121 , while struggling @entity122 snatched a 2 - 2 draw at @entity124 in which three of the goals came in the final four minutes			2
@entity126 and @entity127 drew 0 - 0 in the other game played saturday .			2

@entity19 scores hat - trick as @entity1 's 100 % @entity17 run continues
@entity73 also scores in saturday 's 4 - 0 victory over @entity18
