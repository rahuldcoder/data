-- a string of " brazen attempts " to kill members of a gang task force in @entity5 , @entity6 , has led to a $ 200,000 reward for information			1
authorities hope the reward will encourage people to come forward with information related to three booby traps targeting members of the @entity14 , part of a countywide initiative dedicated to combating gang - related violence in @entity5			1
" these brazen attempts to kill police officers in the line of duty are an outrage and even a form of urban terrorism			1
our brave men and women in uniform put their lives on the line every day to keep our streets safe , " @entity6 attorney general @entity24 said thursday			2
" we urge anyone with information on the attacks to come forward immediately			0
" @entity24 was joined by @entity5 district attorney @entity35 , sheriff @entity36 , @entity38 police chief @entity37 and @entity40 supervisor @entity39 in the public appeal for information			2
multiple local , state and federal agencies , including the @entity45 and the @entity46 contributed to the reward			0
authorities believe the close timing and identical targets of the attacks indicate they could be related , said @entity52 , a spokesman for the district attorney 's office			2
on december 31 , 2009 , the unmarked headquarters of the @entity14 was targeted by someone who redirected the natural gas line on the roof into the building , filling up the office with deadly gas			1
two task force members entering the office smelled gas and backed away before flipping the light switch and potentially causing the building to explode			1
on february 23 , a task force member at the @entity38 headquarters opened a security gate outside the building , which launched a homemade zip gun attached to the gate			1
the weapon fired , missing the officer 's head by inches			0
the headquarters has since been moved to an undisclosed location , where extra security precautions are being taken , @entity52 said			0
on march 5 , 2010 , criminals targeted a task force member who had parked an unmarked police car in front of a convenience store in @entity38			1
the officer found what appeared to be a homemade pipe bomb hidden underneath the vehicle			1
" there 's a person or people out there , a bunch of idiots that are trying to do damage to us			0
we mean to catch them			0
we mean to see them spend the rest of their life in jail , " @entity37 said			0
" i 'm hoping now , with $ 200,000 , somebody 's gon na have noticed one of them , call us , tell us who it is , and let us get something done			1
" @entity38 is one of eight local , state and federal agencies that make up the @entity111 , which was formed in 2006 to address the growth of criminal street gangs and outlaw motorcycle gangs countywide			0
as the county expanded and its population grew , so did the presence and reach of organized crime , @entity52 said			0
since 1997 , the number of gangs in @entity40 has grown from 266 to 391 , according to the task force 's web site , and total gang membership has grown to 10,620 members countywide			1
since the task force 's inception , the number of gang members and violent crimes has decreased and the amount of arrests and warrants served has increased , @entity52 said			1
on wednesday , at least 31 members of the @entity135 motorcycle gang were arrested at locations throughout @entity40 in " @entity137 , " which spanned four states			2
@entity52 said he could not say whether the @entity135 were believed to be involved in the @entity38 booby traps , citing an ongoing investigation			0
he said it was safe to assume that some gang activity was involved in the attacks			1
" it 's possible that the gang members are feeling threatened , that we 're starting to impede on their activity and they 're retaliating , " he said			2
" the investigation is still fluid and no arrests have been made , but they 're not targeting regular police			0
it 's reasonable to believe that they are targeting members of the task force specifically			2
" @entity0 's @entity156 contributed to this report .			0

authorities hope $ 200,000 will produce tips on " brazen attempts " on gang task force
attempts include gas line put in task force office , pipe bomb attached to unmarked car
gang activity , *prevalent* in @entity40 , thought to be related but no arrests yet
