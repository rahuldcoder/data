it is important to first understand that no gay @entity2 , as far as anyone knows , is seeking marriage -- in @entity2			1
you can comb the breadth of our decidedly homophobic media ( " homosexuals are in trouble ! " crowed @entity10 , no doubt mirroring the excitement of its upright editorial board ) , and there is neither anecdotal nor empirical evidence of a clamor , even a quiet one , for gays to be married in churches , mosques or courts			2
still , our legislators were hard at work over a considerable number of weeks while the rest of sane @entity2 , in a state of suspended disbelief , ignored them ; convinced that , in a country with pressing issues such as fuel subsidy removal and debilitating insecurity , this frivolous legislation would not see light of day			1
until yesterday when , of course , it did			0
our elected representatives in the @entity36 , armed with their version of our @entity38 , took time off urgent national issues to tackle the even more urgent evil of gay marriages			0
before we could catch our breaths , our over-paid and under - worked @entity43 had legalized homophobia			1
according to the law , not only is gay marriage a crime punishable by a 14 - year jail term , but " any person who registers operates or participates in gay ... organizations " faces a decade in jail -- a clause that specifically targets the many active sexuality rights advocacy groups in the country			1
by the time the @entity57 adds its predictable voice to this and the president signs it into law , writing this kind of piece might even risk jail time			2
it is important to note though that i and other aware young people who might sometimes be misidentified as the elite , may spend precious hours in vocal incredulity on @entity70 and @entity71 ; shouting down a law that we can hardly do anything about - but we are sadly in the minority , at least for now			2
you see , in @entity2 , homophobia is alive and well			1
@entity2 senate passes anti-gay bill , defying @entity80 aid threat barely 10 days ago , the influential @entity2 blogger @entity81 , shared what was supposed to be a touching story about a young man , @entity84 , who had faced physical abuse for his sexuality			1
the comments that followed made my heart sink -- more threats of violence and death			0
and it was n't a fringe minority ; this is a thriving majority			0
many @entity2 are convinced that homosexuality is " of the devil " , against our " culture " and an encroachment of " sad @entity101 values			1
a young man recently tweeted that " homosexuality is the cause of the present rot in @entity107			2
" what rot ? @entity107 's thriving @entity109 ? a democracy it should be proud of ? or the millions of dollars in aid that its government and people have invested in treating everything from malaria to @entity117 in our dear country ? that 's forgetting that the real giant of @entity122 , @entity122 , is the continent 's bastion of sexuality rights			0
" our values are our values , " the pompous senate president @entity126 replies to critics of the bill			1
nonsense he can get away with , only because a large segment of our educated population is unaware that animals have been found to be gay			0
dead cliches like " @entity135 did not make @entity139 " continue to get excited choruses from sedated congregations and people still declare with ignorance that " homosexuality is not a part of our culture " , conveniently skimming over historical evidence of the practice in the @entity143 of the country ; and blissfully unaware that the origins of homophobia in our societies can only be traced to the influx of foreign religions			2
@entity155 's parliament takes no action on anti-gay bill indeed , you have to weep for a people that decry " foreign imperialism " on one hand , and then ignorantly hide under the cover of colonial influences to perpetuate intolerance			2
it 's the same country whose ex-president recently paid a ' courtesy visit ' to appease confessed terrorists ; the same country where four men who savagely raped a girl and recorded it on video were defended by a police chief as " dealing with snobbish girls			0
" indeed , what else can one expect from a @entity36 that houses a member who defiled and took for a wife , a girl barely in her teens only last year ? but gays -- who only pray for the right to be left alone since they do the rest of us no harm - are the mortal threat to our " moral fabric "			1
they severely threaten the moral fabric of a nation which finds its place in the bottom of corruption rankings years in a row thanks to politicians like @entity126 who have sodomized the populace for decades now			0
today , i am ashamed to be @entity2			1
but it 's not because a gang of morally questionable legislators has forced through a piece of legislation that is both irrelevant and irresponsible			0
it 's rather because , in a country burdened by a lethal mix of misplaced priorities , confused sense of culture and an ignorant electorate , this intolerance is in fact a popular decision			0
we have allowed the politicians to fool us once again .			0
