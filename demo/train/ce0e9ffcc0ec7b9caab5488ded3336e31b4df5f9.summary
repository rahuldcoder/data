-- @entity2 cameras , which let you take a photo and refocus anywhere after it 's taken , are getting two much - requested new features : @entity8 - like filters and the ability to bring the entire image , not just one section , into focus			1
the camera was released early this year by a new @entity15 - based startup			2
@entity17 and rectangular with a small touchscreen on one end and minimal buttons , the camera uses @entity23 technology to capture its interactive images			1
since the camera 's release , @entity2 employees have been busy testing and releasing new features			1
the most recent additions will be available december 4			0
first is the new @entity32 feature			0
until now , you could focus only on one small section of a @entity2 image at a time , which seemed to negate the benefit of having a camera that could focus on everything in the frame			1
@entity32 finally allows you to bring the entire image into focus , but that 's not the most interesting part			2
when you click and drag on a @entity2 picture , there is also a @entity48 effect , allowing you move the image around for altered angles			1
existing @entity2 camera owners will be happy to learn that the effect can be applied to older images as well			1
for one test photo , @entity54 , @entity2 's director of photography and a former underwater photographer , filled a glass @entity58 ornament with paint and shot a pellet through it , capturing the explosion as it happened ( click and drag the image to the left to see the effect )			1
the desktop application will also gain new filter options			0
if there 's anything the photography industry has learned over the past two years , it 's that people love adding quick filters to their photos to make them look better			1
@entity2 's first nine filters are a mix of typical retro -- @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 -- and some genuinely unique effects that take advantage of the interactive features of @entity2 pictures			1
for example , the @entity86 ( below ) throws up a pane of frosted glass between the foreground and the background			0
click around to refocus , and it will move accordingly			0
carnival distorts the photo like a funhouse mirror , undulating in different directions depending on where you focus			1
a year after the product was announced , the question of who exactly it is for still lingers			0
the $ 400 and up price tag is steep for a camera that takes only one kind of photo , and while it 's fun to play with , it 's not immediately clear what practical purpose refocusable photos serve			1
a flattened jpeg of a @entity2 image is only 1.2 megapixels , which rules out many pro photography uses like product photography			1
@entity2 is not sharing any sales numbers or statistics but says the camera has mostly been a hit with amateur photography enthusiasts			2
enterprising customers have found some creative uses			0
food bloggers are snapping interactive shots of their meals ( the ability to make a bowl of ramen jiggle in @entity48 could be an amazing or gross addition )			0
an artist who makes miniature figures uses it to document her work			0
bug lovers everywhere like its impressive macro photography abilities			0
some in the medical field have tested the technology out , too ; @entity2 says there is a dermatologist who uses the camera to take up - close photos of skin issues , and a dentist takes shots of teeth			1
" what we 're looking for are people who are interested in storytelling in some new way , " @entity54 said			2
" that 's the common thread between all of our earlier camera owners			0
" @entity2 has released other updates to the camera 's firmware and desktop software over the year , including rolling out a @entity158 version of the desktop application and adding manual camera controls			2
with the manual controls , you can speed up or slow down the shutter speed to play with interesting effects like light paining			0
the company has also released a handful of accessories , cases and a tripod mount			0
there are new @entity2 body colors ( hot pink and forest green ) , but other than that , the hardware is the exact same camera that started shipping at the start of the year			2
the prices have also stayed the same : $ 399 for the @entity181 camera and $ 499 for the @entity183 version .			0

@entity2 cameras capture photos that can be refocused after they 're taken
new photo filters include a funhouse mirror effect and retro coloring
@entity2 images can finally be focused entirely ; *perspective* - *shifting* effect has been added
