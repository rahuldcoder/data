-- when @entity2 signed on to the @entity4 campaign in january 2012 , he was seen as a key supporter -- a rising star in the @entity6 , a swing state campaigner and a staunch conservative who could protect @entity4 on the right			1
for the next 11 months , @entity2 zipped around the country , pitching the candidate he said was " exactly what our nation needs			2
" the @entity18 senator 's hard - nosed approach landed him on @entity4 's vice presidential short list			1
he was even vetted for the job			0
the @entity4 campaign was undoubtedly the height of @entity2 's political career			1
after he failed to deliver his state and @entity4 lost the election , @entity2 stepped out of the limelight and remained relatively quiet on @entity27 as president @entity28 settled in for a second term			1
that 's when @entity2 , a former @entity31 budget director , was thrust into the divisive national debate when he publicly acknowledged that he had changed his mind on same - sex marriage			1
" i 'm announcing today a change of heart on an issue that a lot of people feel strongly about that has to do with gay couples ' opportunity to marry , " @entity2 told @entity0 chief congressional correspondent @entity35 two years after learning his son , @entity36 , was gay			1
will @entity2 ' especially proud ' of father " i 've come to the conclusion that for me , personally , i think this is something that we should allow people to do , to get married , and to have the joy and stability of marriage that i 've had for over 26 years			2
that i want all of my children to have , including our son , who is gay , " @entity2 said			1
@entity2 is an unexpected advocate for same - sex marriage -- and he admitted as much in the interview			1
" what happened to me is really personal , " @entity2 said			0
" i mean , i had n't thought a lot about this issue			0
again , my focus has been on other issues over my public policy career			0
" even though he is seen as a social conservative , someone whose social policy is deeply rooted in his @entity69 faith , @entity2 is noticeably out of his comfort zone in this discussion			0
it is budget and tax issues , not marriage and sexuality , that he is better known for			2
@entity2 was first elected to the @entity77 in 2010 after receiving little challenge from @entity80 @entity79 for a seat vacated by @entity6 @entity82			1
while there , he has pushed fiscal issues , including a balanced budget amendment			0
this focus tracks with @entity2 's past			0
his first foray into elected office was when he won a @entity31 seat in 1993 , representing @entity18 's 2nd @entity91			0
@entity2 stirs mixed reaction with same - sex marriage reversal in that role , he began to hone his expertise on budget and fiscal issues			1
during his 12 years in the @entity31 , @entity2 sat on the @entity98 and budget committees -- two powerful budget and tax - writing panels -- and co-chaired the @entity102 on restructuring the @entity103			1
his expertise was noticed by the @entity104 @entity31			0
@entity104 made @entity2 the @entity106 trade representative in 2005 and he became the @entity6 president 's budget director the next year			1
the job required @entity2 to dive into the esoteric world of federal spending			0
on his website , @entity2 describes himself as " a deficit hawk " that proposed " a balanced budget , " fought " irresponsible earmarks " and advocated for more transparency			2
not everyone agrees with that assessment , however			0
@entity2 was only at the budget office for a year where he worked with the @entity31 on its fiscal 2008 budget -- a document that led to a deficit of $ 459 billion			2
when @entity2 was rumored as a possible vice presidential candidate for @entity4 , nearly all @entity126 operatives attacked him for his time as @entity104 's top budget deputy			1
many said he portrayed himself as a deficit hawk , but did n't live up to those ideals when he worked for the @entity31			0
@entity133 , the @entity18 state director for @entity28 's 2012 campaign , stressed these critiques in a blog post for the campaign			2
" as one of the architects of the top - down @entity104 budget , @entity2 practically invented the policies that punished middle - class families while exploding the deficit , and crashing our economy , " @entity138 wrote			1
@entity2 , in the middle of the presidential campaign , even tried to distance himself from the @entity104 administration			0
" i was frustrated when i was there about some spending issues â € ” specifically , as you know , i wanted to offer a balanced budget over five years , and a lot of people did n't , " @entity2 said in an interview with the @entity152			2
the president sent his budget â € ” not my budget , his budget â € ” a five - year balanced budget			0
but it was a fight , internally			0
