@entity0 -- @entity3 , while on the campaign trail in 1992 , attacked the @entity5 administration for collaborating with " the butchers of @entity7			1
" if he won the @entity8 , @entity3 promised , he would put human rights first when dealing with the @entity10			2
but six months after assuming the @entity11 , @entity3 tossed those promises out the window , and dealing with @entity10 returned to " business as usual , " according to @entity15 , a former @entity3 policy adviser			2
candidates , once elected , usually struggle to live up to their rhetoric on foreign policy			1
the reason is simple , according to a cadre of international affairs experts : the view from inside the @entity11 is much different from the view from outside			0
" it is very difficult for presidential candidates to know even a fraction of the facts and the texture of diplomatic relations between the @entity31 and other countries , " said @entity15			2
" once you get inside the @entity8 , the world looks very different			0
" with foreign policy about to take center stage on monday during the last presidential debate of the 2012 cycle , experts say @entity41 challenger @entity40 should be cautious about over-promising			1
but some say he already has			0
in @entity40 's october 8 foreign policy address , the @entity41 candidate promised to increase sanctions on @entity46 , help arm @entity48 rebels who " share our values , " and close the " daylight " between @entity52 and the @entity31			1
@entity53 , a professor of international relations at @entity55 and a former national security adviser to president @entity57 , said @entity40 joins a long line of candidates who promise too much			1
" he will have to wake up if he were elected , " @entity53 said			0
" it would be irresponsible for him to implement " some of those promises , and " i suspect his new secretary of state would tell him that			0
" if @entity40 wants proof of the pitfalls of foreign policy promises , all he has to do is look across the table at monday 's debate at the man he is trying to unseat			1
during the 2008 campaign , then - candidate @entity71 advocated for regional conferences with @entity48 and @entity46 , said his administration would enter diplomatic talks with governments that his predecessor , president @entity77 , would not , and pledged to eliminate @entity79 's nuclear weapons program			1
@entity48 has fallen into a long civil war , @entity46 continues to be a provocateur in the @entity82 , and @entity79 is still developing its nuclear program			1
possibly @entity71 's biggest broken promise is the one to close the prison at @entity87 , @entity88			1
" i have said repeatedly that i intend to close @entity87 , and i will follow through on that , " @entity71 told @entity90 ' @entity89 in 2008			2
@entity87 remains open , even though @entity71 signed an executive order to have it closed two days after he took office in 2009			2
the issue has largely been put on the back burner in light of issues on the economy			0
governing on foreign policy is more difficult than talking tough on it , @entity15 said , because it hinges on the instability of the globe and can change in the blink of an eye			1
" i think this is the reality of political campaigns , " @entity15 said			0
" you can say things ( on the campaign trail ) in good faith , based on consulting with experts -- and it is rarely the case that candidates say things about foreign policy that they know not to be the case			1
the issue is once you get inside the @entity8 , the world looks very different			0
" pastor , the former @entity57 adviser , says these unmet foreign policy promises can be broken up into three distinct groups			1
there are the promises that are sincere but difficult -- or impossible -- to meet because they require action from other governments			0
" secondly , there are promises that are sincere but can not be implemented because the political opposition makes it impossible , " @entity53 said			0
lastly , according to @entity53 , are promises that are made because they are political expedient but prove irresponsible once the ramifications are understood			0
presidential history is littered with promises that fall into these categories			1
during the 2000 campaign , then - @entity137 gov. @entity77 promised to move the @entity139 in @entity52 to @entity140 , a promise that many of his predecessors had also made			2
the embassy , however , to this day remains in @entity145			0
upon assuming office in 1981 , @entity146 promised to get tough and stop the @entity148 , a left - wing @entity149 political party that swept across @entity150			2
the @entity148 were still around when @entity146 left office in 1989 and to this day continue to hold political power in @entity149			0
in 1960 , then - sen. @entity153 used soaring foreign policy rhetoric to help catapult him to the @entity8 at the young age of 43			1
according to the @entity157 's @entity156 , @entity153 failed to live up to his rhetoric on international affairs			2
" the execution of @entity153 's foreign policy did not quite live up to the stirring rhetoric of his inaugural speech			1
... in fact , his foreign policy was marred by a string of failures , " reads the @entity157 website			1
in april of 1961 , @entity153 had only been in office for a short three months when he called for a meeting with @entity172 , his predecessor in the office			0
the @entity176 , a carryover from the @entity172 administration , had been a massive failure that month and an early blunder by the @entity153 presidency -- even though many attributed the failure to @entity172			0
the @entity182 relationship had been frosty , at best , after the young senator defeated the former general 's vice president , @entity184 , in the 1960 campaign			2
even though @entity172 had long viewed @entity153 as naive -- he referred to @entity153 as " @entity188 " -- the two put their chilly relationship aside and the sitting president invited the former general to @entity192 to review the mistakes in @entity88			0
according to @entity172 's notes from the meeting and a number of media reports , the conversation between the new and former president previewed the pitfalls of foreign policy campaign promises : @entity153 : " no one knows how tough this job is until he 's been in it a few months			1
" @entity172 : " mr. president			0
if you will forgive me , i think i mentioned that to you three months ago			0

candidates often struggle in office to live up to foreign policy promises
@entity40 has promised to help arm @entity48 rebels , talked tough on @entity46
much of @entity71 's foreign policy agenda from 2008 campaign has n't been realized
