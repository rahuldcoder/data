-- may 5 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity15 , @entity16 : hi , i 'm @entity18			2
@entity19 , @entity16 : and i 'm @entity20			2
we 're from @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24			2
we 'd like to recognize ms. @entity25 , our social studies teacher			1
@entity26 : and tell her how much we appreciate her for what she does for us			2
both students : we love you , ms. @entity25 ! @entity31 , @entity32 : we love you too , ms. @entity25 ! and all of you teachers out there as @entity35 continues			1
your 10 minutes of commercial - free headlines start right now ! first up : photo release debate @entity40 : first up , president @entity41 is scheduled to meet with families of victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks			1
the meeting 's scheduled for this morning			1
and they 're happening as he visits @entity48 , the site of the @entity49 , which was attacked on 9/11			2
the visit comes days after @entity51 -- the man responsible for the 9/11 attacks -- was killed by @entity55 forces			1
that happened at this compound in @entity5			2
yesterday , president @entity41 said the government wo n't release any pictures of @entity51 's body			1
this is a debate that 's been going on since the terrorist leader 's death			1
should pictures be released as proof ? the government confirmed it was @entity51 through dna testing , but some people say that 's not enough evidence ; they want to see proof			1
one argument is that releasing a photo could anger terrorists who might want to retaliate against the @entity55 another argument is that if the photos are going to get out eventually , the government should release them now , on its own terms			1
today 's @entity81 questions at @entity82 encourage you to consider the same questions that lawmakers are debating			1
what are the potential pros and cons of releasing these photos ? and how might different groups of people react if the photos ever are released ? @entity91 @entity92 , @entity32 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity95 's social studies class at @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98 ! which of these special operations groups is part of the @entity102 ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity108 , b ) @entity109 , @entity110 ) seals or @entity111 ) combat controllers ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! seals are part of the @entity102 ; the name stands for @entity115			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! mission training @entity40 : sea , air and land , because the @entity113 are trained to operate in all of those environments			1
seals have been an integral part of the wars in @entity127 and @entity128			2
and it was a group of these elite troops who carried out the operation that killed @entity51 in @entity5			1
@entity132 shows us how they trained for this mission			1
( begin video ) @entity137 , @entity0 pentagon correspondent : the team that killed @entity51 had gone through thousands of scenarios for assaulting a compound , just like this group of @entity113 on @entity55 soil			1
but the team that went after @entity51 was special , part of the @entity144 , or @entity144			1
@entity145 , @entity146 : this seal team is the all - star of the @entity146 teams			2
@entity150 : @entity151 is a former seal who says the men in that raid have at least five years as special operators			2
@entity145 : this seal team is based on combat experience			2
and all these guys probably have 100 , 200 missions			2
@entity150 : the @entity160 provided detailed satellite pictures of @entity51 's compound , enough to build a replica where the seal team practiced			1
a senior defense official says for a time , they trained without knowing who their actual target was			1
but by sunday , they knew the location of every gate and window in that compound , the exact height of the walls			2
@entity177 , deputy national security advisor : they operated according to that , and they did n't know when they got there exactly what some of the internal features of it would be			2
@entity150 : the defense official says by the time the @entity113 ran out of the house with @entity51 's body , they could probably count the exact number of steps to the helicopter outside			1
special operator training is brutal			2
@entity195 : let 's go , @entity197			1
fletch just passed you up			2
@entity150 : but the men that took down @entity51 do n't necessarily look like linebackers			1
@entity145 : they have a great deal of muscle			2
just not everybody is massive			2
you know , you do n't have to be , you know , 6 ' 5 " , 250 pounds to be a seal			2
@entity150 : two teams were supposed to fast rope down from the @entity212			2
but one helicopter had mechanical problems and had to land hard ; put one team directly on the ground			2
there was a contingency plan , and the @entity113 scrambled out to continue their mission			1
@entity145 : there 's a reason why they brought two helicopters			1
because in the seal teams , we say two is one ; one is none			0
and , you know , they knew what to do even in the event of a downed helicopter			0
( @entity232 ) levee concerns @entity40 : efforts to lower flood levels in the midwestern @entity55 are working , but the threat is still there			0
we told you yesterday that officials are trying to help some communities by intentionally flooding other areas			0
we also talked about the tense debate over that plan			0
@entity245 is in @entity7 , where this is happening			0
he filed this report yesterday on the explosive situation			0
( begin video ) @entity245 , @entity250 : day two of the exploding levee extravaganza			0
extreme measures taken for , really , an extreme flood event			0
we have n't seen this level on the river here in @entity6 and along the @entity258 since 1937			0
and yesterday , they blew up a second levee			0
take a look at this video			0
@entity264 stuff , during the daytime			0
soil and earth being blown above the tree tops			0
that is at the opposite end of this floodway , so that some of this water can begin to drain			0
this is now not so good farmland , at least for this year			0
and that has a lot of farmers upset			0
there 's class - action lawsuits happening , the state of @entity7 not happy at all about this solution that they 've had			1
we tracked down one farmer , a retired farmer , old timer who was here during the 1930s flood			0
and here 's what he had to say about the situation			1
@entity295 , retired farmer : some of them are farming a lot of acres , and they 've just been lucky these last few years that they have n't had a flood			0
this is one of the things that happens once in a great while , and they just had to take it on the chin			0
@entity308 : not just farmers who are getting hit with this			0
lot of towns are evacuated , a lot of homes are completely flooded out			0
yesterday , we went out with the @entity316 and the @entity317 , and they toured us around some areas that were really hit hard , @entity319 among them			0
a lot of these folks are n't going to see the waters recede for several days , because what they have released here , now they 're releasing more water upstream that 's been held with all this rainfall			1
so , this is going to be a multiweek event that will be affecting millions of people all the way down into @entity333			0
reporting from @entity6 , @entity7 , i 'm @entity245			0
( @entity232 ) @entity335 @entity40 : the governor of @entity8 says the road to recovery is going to be long and it 's gon na be tough as his state struggles through the impact of deadly storms			1
the @entity342 held a moment of silence yesterday , exactly one week after a tornado hit the town of @entity346			0
in this @entity351 , one @entity8 resident talks about his experiences following this storm			1
( begin video ) @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 : everyone , this is @entity358 , or @entity359 on @entity360			0
we 're here at the remnants of my house from the tornadoes that came through on april 27 , 2011			0
tornadoes that came through and hit @entity8 , @entity367 , @entity368 , all the other states that were affected			1
if you look from my front porch here , i mean just in the general area , practically every house here is completely flattened			0
there are people down the road , neighbors of mine , that are now dead			0
i have cousins , aunts , uncles all around			0
i mean , there 's trash and pictures , everything that 's been found hundreds of miles away from here by other people			1
we 're not here today to make you all upset and everything			1
i just wanted to make this video to thank those who have shown support to me , my family , friends of mine and others who 've been affected by the tragedy			0
we 've had plenty of support , me personally from people on @entity360 , @entity404 , everything			0
and i just wanted to thank everyone , so that 's what this video is going to be about			1
( @entity232 ) @entity40 : you heard mr. @entity358 talk about @entity360 and @entity404			0
he turned to social media to let people know what he 's going through , and social media is helping him recover , too			1
celebrities that he contacted directly actually replied back to him , shared his story with others			0
some simply asked , " what can i do to help ? " @entity358 says it 's helped to raise awareness and raise donations for him and his family			1
sometimes it only takes 140 characters to make that kind of difference			0
before we go @entity40 : before we go , you 've heard the phrase " lead by example			0
" well , when a flash workout broke out during a " @entity434 " event in @entity433 , first lady @entity41 did just that			1
" @entity434 " is her campaign to fight childhood obesity , and this dance sequence was designed especially for it			0
these students might have known they were going to get down , but i bet they did n't expect to see the first lady getting down too			1
goodbye @entity40 : but that 's the kind of experience that ca n't be beat			1
we 're gon na turn the beat around and step up for another edition of @entity0 tomorrow			0
@entity447 's @entity446 : thanks for visiting yesterday			1
