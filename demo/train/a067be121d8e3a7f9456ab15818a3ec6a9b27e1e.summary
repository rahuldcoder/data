@entity0 , @entity1 -- the arduous @entity6 peace talks continued on tuesday in @entity1 , where officials from @entity10 and the @entity11 " have begun a serious discussion on core issues , " a top @entity4 diplomat said			1
" they have agreed to begin first on working to achieve a framework agreement for permanent status			0
that work is now well under way , " said @entity4 special envoy @entity15			2
@entity10 prime minister @entity18 and @entity11 leader @entity19 attended the sessions , along with @entity15 and @entity4 secretary of state @entity21			1
officials met for an hour and 40 minutes in bilateral and multilateral meetings			0
@entity15 briefed the media after the session and said the goals remain a two - state solution , condemnation of violence and working toward security , and a resolution of all issues			1
he reiterated the @entity35 administration 's position that @entity10 should extend the moratorium on settlement construction in the @entity38 , a hiatus scheduled to end later this month			1
" we believe we are moving in the right direction overall , " he said			2
the parties are aiming toward resolving all core issues within the next 12 months in a process that kicked off recently during a meeting between @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity46 in @entity47			1
issues separating both sides include @entity51 settlements in the @entity38 , the future of @entity11 refugees , @entity10 security , and the status of @entity56			1
@entity46 and @entity15 are expected to continue talks with the leaders in @entity56 on wednesday			1
tensions are growing over the issue of possible new @entity10 settlements in the @entity38			1
@entity18 is under pressure from the @entity63 and the @entity35 administration to extend a 10 - month moratorium on building @entity10 settlements in the disputed @entity38 territory			1
that moratorium is set to expire september 26			0
@entity63 have said the construction would torpedo the talks , but @entity10 says some construction is likely			2
acknowledging that the settlement issue is sensitive in @entity10 , @entity15 said both sides have a responsibility to continue the meetings and he called on @entity19 to take steps to advance the talks			1
" all issues ultimately must be resolved by the parties themselves , " @entity15 told reporters			2
" the @entity4 will , as we 've said on many occasions , be an active and sustained partner throughout the talks and will , when necessary and appropriate , make proposals and provide encouragement to the parties			0
in the end , matters must be resolved by parties themselves and we hope and expect that they will do so			0
" @entity15 said he would n't divulge many details about the talks , noting the importance of confidentiality and sensitivity			2
but he did say " our vision is for a two - state solution			0
" " that includes a @entity51 , democratic state of @entity10 living side by side in peace and security with a viable , independent , sovereign and contiguous state of @entity104			2
but of course , this is one of many sensitive issues the parties need to resolve themselves and that 's the point of negotiations			0
the parties will reach agreement on all major issues			0
" prior to arriving in @entity0 , @entity1 , on tuesday morning , @entity46 said if there are no negotiations , there will be no security for @entity10 and no state for the @entity63			1
this is n't @entity46 's first time to participate in an attempt to secure a two - state solution			0
as first lady , though not a principal negotiator , she traveled to the @entity6 to meet with @entity10 and @entity11 leaders in support of president @entity46 's policies on the issue			1
the president eventually hosted @entity10 and @entity11 leaders at @entity130 , @entity131 , for what proved to be unsuccessful final - status talks			1
now , as secretary of state , @entity46 has a second chance and a more direct platform to help the parties reach a comprehensive settlement			0
should @entity46 help shepherd an agreement , it would " fulfill a longtime desire to succeed in this area , " said @entity139 , who was @entity4 ambassador to @entity10 during part of president @entity46 's second term			0
" she has something of a long history of being involved " in the region , said @entity139 , who also used to be an assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs			0
" this would be a great fulfillment for her personally and for the administration and the country			0
" @entity2 's @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
