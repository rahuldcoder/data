this neat little video of an @entity6 , an @entity7 and a @entity8 getting seared and charred has been making the viral video rounds			1
each of the phones delivers digital smack talk ( " how do you like them apples ? ! " ) before the searing heat puts them out of their misery			0
the video is apparently designed to promote the @entity18 disposable grill			1
they got some help though from @entity22 - based @entity21			2
not bad for the cost of three phones and a grill			0
in case you were wondering , the @entity7 was the first to go , while the @entity6 's temperature protection feature kicked in right on schedule			2
that makes the @entity31 7 the most fire - resistant of the bunch			1
