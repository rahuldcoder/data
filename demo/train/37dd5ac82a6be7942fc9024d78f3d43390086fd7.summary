-- an ambitious employee of " @entity2 , " an all - seeing , all - knowing tech company at the heart of the new novel by @entity6 , raises her hand to pitch an idea to her bosses : use the firm 's social network to register virtually everyone in @entity13 to vote			1
then she takes it further			0
" our interfaces are infinitely easier to use than , say the patchwork of @entity21 sites around the country , " she says			0
" what if you could renew your license through us ? what if every government service could be facilitated through our network ? people would leap at the chance			1
instead of visiting a hundred different sites for a hundred different government services , it could all be done through the @entity2			1
" the idea of substituting a frictionless private network for clunky government sites might seem an appealing one , given the much - publicized woes of @entity40 's @entity39			1
it 's just one of the ways @entity6 is fortunate in the timing of his book , which seems ripped from recent headlines about privacy , technology and social media			1
" @entity2 " will send many readers hunting for the paperback copies of " 1984 " they have n't opened since high school			1
but does its portrait of a digital totalitarian future inspire the same kind of foreboding that @entity56 's dystopian novel did at a time when many people believed dictatorships were destined to control the world ? are @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 taking us to , as a @entity66 column in the @entity67 suggested , " a world without privacy " ? @entity6 builds his story around @entity72 , a naive employee of her hometown 's public utility , who escapes the boredom of her life in a cubicle by landing a job at @entity2 , the most desirable tech company around			1
through a friend , rising @entity2 star @entity81 , @entity80 is installed in a " customer experience " post where she is dazzled by the company 's feature - rich 400 - acre campus , full of benefits for workers ranging from tennis courts to gyms to theaters to a cafeteria where famous singer - songwriters show up to entertain			1
powerful politicians are always visiting the campus			0
company parties offer primo food and drink			0
employees are encouraged to help themselves to the merchandise at a company store stocked with cutting - edge products that have n't yet been publicly released			0
@entity80 's father , who suffers from multiple sclerosis , and who , with her mother , is locked in constant battle with his health insurer for the care he needs , is soon put on @entity2 's generous health plan , at @entity81 's behest			1
yet @entity80 's work , a grueling round of interaction with @entity2 's customers , is at odds with the paradise of benefits the company touts			2
everything she does is instantly measured and rated and she 's encouraged to keep going back to the customers to persuade them to give her higher scores			0
she goes to absurd lengths to win favorable ratings			0
and those parties are n't only a reward for her hard work ; attendance is mandatory for those who want to be seen as embracing @entity2 's values and suitable for promotion			2
officials blithely talk about the importance of " work - life balance " when what they really mean is that people should be using their " off hours " to be furthering @entity2 's agenda through social media			1
eventually , @entity80 will graduate from " customer experience " and gain fame as she wears a camera that makes her life almost totally transparent			0
she only has to look at her wrist device to see the " zings , " @entity63 - like bursts of comments her millions of followers send as they react to every conversation she has and every letter she reads			0
@entity80 's ties to @entity81 , her parents and an old boyfriend and to her passion for kayaking are steadily weakened as she falls afoul of @entity2 's imperatives to share and to reveal all			2
rather than rebel and quit her job at the prestigious company , though , she becomes the fiercest adherent of its values			0
at @entity2 , employees are encouraged to think big , to hatch ideas for new services relying on the power of big data , measurement and intrusiveness			2
and those ideas are breathtaking in their ambition -- and scary in that they do n't seem as far from realization as they should in @entity6 ' fantasy world			2
a book that begins as a lighthearted cautionary tale grows into a claustrophobic portrait of relentless effort to achieve the culmination of " closing the @entity2 , " erasing privacy and anonymity to the point where anyone anywhere can be located with precision within minutes and tracked by @entity2 's " @entity189 " cameras or by fleets of drones			1
how much of " @entity2 " is tongue - in - cheek ? there are parts where @entity6 surely is having fun with @entity80 's innocence and her bosses ' laughable rhetoric and overweening ambition			1
none of the characters is fully formed enough to seem real			0
still , he seems to be searching also for a way to prod people to ask whether the cost of surrendering privacy is always an acceptable price to pay for the newest service or the coolest device			2
in a recent interview with @entity212 , @entity6 was asked : " what is the greatest threat to our freedom today ? " his answer : " our feeling that we 're entitled to know anything we want about anyone we want			0
" in this respect , " @entity2 " is n't all that far away from " 1984 " in its ability to sound an alarm			1
yet @entity56 's vision , from the vantage point of the late 1940s , was guided by the actual horrors of the @entity228 's totalitarian regime			0
@entity6 , as much as his narrative evokes the events of today from the @entity232 surveillance controversy to the @entity40 website troubles , imagines a horrific future that has n't arrived and likely will never come .			0

in a novel , a character proposes that a social network should take on government functions
" @entity2 " is proposed as a venue for voter registration , and every government service
author @entity6 *paints* dark picture of *corporations* using digital networks to erase privacy
does @entity6 ' vision *resemble* the kind of totalitarianism depicted in " 1984 " ?
