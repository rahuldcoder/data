-- having to ask for a seat belt extender on a flight was one of @entity5 's biggest life humiliations			1
he also could n't shop at popular clothing stores -- the clothing was n't large enough			1
when he found clothing that fit , he often did n't have a choice in styles or colors , able only to purchase pants available in size 50			2
at his heaviest , in 2005 , @entity5 weighed 278 pounds			1
only 5 feet 5 inches tall , he was considered severely obese			2
for several years he cycled around low - carb diets to temporarily lose 30 to 40 pounds , only to gain it back			1
none of the many other diets he tried worked , either			2
then , by chance , the solution found him			2
over @entity25 weekend 2013 , @entity5 and his wife watched " @entity26 , " a documentary on the science behind plant - based eating			1
at that point , he weighed 258 pounds			1
the scientific evidence presented on why humans should eat a plant - based diet just made sense to @entity5			1
it was like a light bulb went on , he explains			2
he read numerous books and watched online lectures to learn more as he began eating from the four food groups recommended by the @entity40 : fruits , vegetables , whole grains and legumes ( with nuts and seeds )			1
gradually , he cut out sugar , salt and oils			2
" as i saw the scientific evidence of how we have evolved as herbivores and not omnivores , and as i saw how well my body was reacting to feeding it a low - fat , whole - food , plant - based diet , it became progressively easier from there , " said @entity5 , a 37 - year - old entrepreneur in @entity50			1
the quick results were encouraging			2
it was n't just his weight that started to drop			2
his cholesterol went from over 200 to 167			2
his health insurance rates also went down three times as he got healthier			0
at the same time , other things were on the rise , including his energy levels and his ability to taste food			0
" once you start eating this way , your palate totally changes , " @entity5 said			1
" you are tasting food the way food was supposed to taste in the first place			0
like a film has been lifted off your taste buds			0
" he also discovered that he could eat as much as he wanted of the right foods and not gain weight			0
his new way of eating felt more like abundance than deprivation			1
breakfast foods included oatmeal and fruit smoothies with almond milk			0
for lunch or dinner , his favorite foods became steamed vegetables with a faux @entity97 seasoning , red lentil chili , baked potatoes , vegan mac and cheese and split pea soup			0
if he got hungry in between meals , unsalted and unroasted nuts , fruit or chia pudding made with almond milk were his snacks			0
after one year and one day on his new diet , @entity5 had successfully lost 100 pounds			1
he now weighs 138 , his pant size is 31 -- 19 sizes smaller than his heaviest -- and he wears a size small in shirts			0
@entity5 's story is n't uncommon , says dr. @entity116 , a @entity117 physician who has been studying the effect of nutrition on disease for over 30 years and who answered diet questions from @entity5 during his transformation			1
after moving people away from a rich , high - fat @entity126 diet full of meat and dairy , @entity116 says he 's seen patients lose weight , be cured of constipation and lower their cholesterol levels			1
one of the biggest keys to these results , he says , is understanding that humans have always been primarily starch eaters ; starches are n't bad			0
pasta , beans , rice , corn and potatoes are foods that satisfy the body and can be alternatives to meat and dairy			0
" people think they are going to starve to death if they do n't eat a hamburger , " @entity116 said			0
@entity116 went on to say that the marketing of meat and dairy has become so effective that we often associate calcium with dairy and protein with meat , when , according to him , it 's quite easy to get those nutrients from a natural , vegetarian diet			1
@entity5 credits his ease in transitioning into this plant - based diet to living close to a grocery store where he could purchase healthy foods and working from home , which made it easier to cook			1
he also found a quiet indoor pool with a friendly staff where he swims around 20 laps six to seven days a week			0
" i do n't crave foods i no longer eat			0
i 'm not going to bed hungry			0
everything about life is better			0
" from overweight smoker to marathon contender			0

@entity5 tried almost every diet without success
documentary on plant - based eating inspired him to change his *lifestyle*
he lost 100 pounds in a year
