@entity0 -- while an increasingly unpopular president @entity3 seems to be on a self - imposed @entity5 strategy this election , one @entity2 is in demand on the campaign trail : sen. @entity9			1
she 's an unabashed progressive from @entity11 , a @entity2 who thinks @entity12 are too timid and a populist who has been called to help in red , blue and purple states			1
and despite her frequent protests , she 's someone that liberals long to see launch a 2016 bid for the @entity20			2
@entity21 is an unusual @entity22 phenom — a combination of loyal soldier and inside agitator , a star who has no problem taking on her own party			1
" what the @entity12 have to do is be willing to stand up and fight , " she tells @entity1			1
asked if the party has n't been willing to do that , she responds : " i just think we can use a little more of that			2
i think we can use a little more of standing up and saying this is what it 's about , and i 'm willing to do it			1
" @entity21 's job this election season is to gin up a party base that lacks energy , and she 's been taking her message to get out the vote to 15 states so far			1
this weekend , she ventures to @entity46 to stump for sen. @entity47 , locked in a close contest with @entity50 @entity49			1
the race is personal for @entity21 : she defeated @entity49 in 2012 for her @entity53 seat when he lived in @entity11			1
poll : dead heat in @entity46 @entity53 race @entity21 has also raised money -- about $ 6 million -- for the party this cycle			1
but most of all , she 's reminding democrats that they have a large stake in this election			2
" the powerful and the rich should get richer and more powerful , " @entity21 tells a crowd of several hundred in @entity66			1
" that 's what it 's all about for the @entity50			2
" @entity21 is the messenger that president @entity3 ca n't be — at least not now			1
it 's been a tricky election year for him : his popularity is on the decline , the world is increasingly dangerous and his democrats are at growing risk of losing control of the @entity53			2
they 're left in a precarious place , trying to figure out the best ways to motivate the @entity3 base -- without @entity3			2
in @entity84 , where incumbent @entity12 sen. @entity85 is in a tight race against @entity87 rep. @entity87 , she plays to the college audience in @entity66			1
" the fight comes to you			1
if you pick up what you 've got , and you put everything you can into it , then together you , me , @entity85 , all of us , that 's how we are going to build a future together , " she says			2
but she 's also been able to play in the red states of @entity100 and @entity101 , where she campaigned this summer with @entity53 candidates @entity103 and @entity104			2
@entity21 's rise as a party star is , well , complicated			1
while the president first tapped her to help create the @entity109 , he did not nominate her as its first chief — worried she could not get confirmed -- so she ran for the @entity53 , with @entity20 backing			0
but she 's not shy about taking on the @entity20 , calling its bailout more of a sell - out			0
" you know if president @entity3 had not been in the @entity20 we would not have the @entity109 today			0
this is an agency that has forced the biggest banks in this country to return more than four billion dollars directly to people they cheated , and that 's been just three years , " she tells @entity1			1
but there 's a but in there : " of course there 's a but coming because there 's another half to this ... he also chose an economic team and when the going got tough , the economic team chose @entity135			0
they protected @entity135 over @entity138 families , and that 's just something i think is fundamentally wrong			0
" in the past , she has also called former secretary of state @entity143 — a frontrunner for the 2016 @entity12 presidential nomination and an ex-new @entity147 senator -- too close to the financial sector			1
" i have said i worry about everyone who is too close to @entity135			0
when i describe what this race is about , it 's about who does government work for			0
i worry everywhere , " she says in the interview			0
not exactly a ringing endorsement , although she has signed a letter urging @entity159 to run for the presidency			0
even so , she has become the left 's anti-hillary and the @entity50 poster child for big government liberalism			0
she and her agenda star in the conservative @entity166 videos linking her to @entity3			0
@entity50 say she energizes their base as much as she does the @entity12 , but she balks at the notion			1
" whoa , whoa , wait , wait because i believe we should have a little higher minimum wage , because i believe women should have access to birth control , because i believe the @entity138 government not be making tens of billions of dollars in profits off the backs of our kids on student loans , because i believe @entity180 should not be privatized			0
that 's what i believe in			0
that 's what i am out there fighting for			0
" she 's fighting , she says repeatedly , to keep democrats in charge of the @entity53 in 2014			0
but what about 2016 ? she is determined not to look beyond this year 's election , staying relentlessly on message while her supporters want the 2016 door open : " you could ask this as many ways as you want			0
i 'm not running for president			0
" opinion : how the ' seinfeld election ' could actually make a difference			0

@entity9 is pushing fellow @entity12 to fight more
