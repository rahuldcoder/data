turns out the @entity1 had landed , after all			1
the 11 - year - old mystery of what happened to the @entity6 - sponsored @entity1 @entity5 lander on its trip to the red planet 's surface appeared to be mostly solved friday with the announcement the craft had been spotted in high - resolution @entity13 images taken from orbit			1
the lander -- crammed with devices to look for signs of life on @entity5 -- never radioed home after hitching a ride aboard the @entity23 's @entity22 orbiter and dropping into the atmosphere on december 25 , 2003			1
the images appear to show that the lander 's solar panels did n't fully open after landing , preventing the craft from getting power and exposing the antenna it would have used to communicate with controllers on @entity34 , according to the space agency			2
while the reasons for that failure remain unknown , the discovery of the lander helps solve one of the most enduring mysteries in @entity5 exploration , said @entity43 , a @entity1 team member from the @entity44			1
" @entity48 since 2003 i have wondered what happened to @entity1 , " he said , adding that he 'd almost given up hope of ever knowing what had come of the lander			1
" the highly complex entry , descent and landing sequence seems to have worked perfectly and only during the final phases of deployment did @entity1 unfortunately run into problems , " he said			2
the lander , which is less than 2 meters ( 6.56 feet ) across when fully deployed , was first spotted in the @entity13 images by @entity59 of @entity60 , @entity61 -- a former member of the @entity23 's @entity22 operations team , the @entity56 said			2
@entity59 is among a group of @entity1 team members who have spent years combing through images from @entity13 's @entity68 camera , which is on the agency 's @entity69 , looking for signs of the missing craft , the agency said			2
he found it in an area near the planned landing zone , an impact basin called @entity77 close to the @entity5 equator			0
the grainy images appear to show the lander resting on the surface , its solar panels only partially deployed			0
the craft 's rear cover and parachutes are nearby			0
had the lander deployed properly , a suite of onboard tools would have been used to analyze rocks , soil and atmosphere for signs of life			0
the lander -- the first @entity97 craft sent to the @entity98 -- was named after the @entity99 , the ship that carried @entity100 on a groundbreaking 5 - year scientific survey			0
while its namesake resulted in no such breakthroughs , @entity105 , chief executive of the @entity56 , said the discovery proves the @entity1 had its successes			0
" the history of space exploration is marked by both success and failure , " he said			0
" this finding makes the case that @entity1 was more of a success than we previously knew and undoubtedly an important step in @entity97 's continuing exploration of @entity5			1

a missing @entity6 lander is spotted on the surface of @entity5
the @entity1 never radioed @entity34 after descending to the @entity5 surface in 2003
