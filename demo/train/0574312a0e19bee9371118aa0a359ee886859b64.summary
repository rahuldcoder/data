-- " we 'd like to send this out to our brother @entity8 , " @entity0 announced during the encore of @entity4 's saturday set at @entity5			1
it was the first and only time @entity0 acknowledged the absence of guitarist @entity11 , who recently entered rehab			1
otherwise , it was business as usual , with @entity11 's fill - in , @entity16 ( @entity17 , an @entity18 session guitarist ) subbing in admirably , picking up @entity11 's talk box parts and adding muscle to a show that only got better and better , especially in its last hour			1
@entity1 : choose the cover of @entity1 : vote now ! openers " @entity24 " and " @entity29 " aside , the first half of the show leaned heavily on recent material , leaving the crowd a little restless			0
but @entity0 's showmanship kicked in as the band worked parts of " @entity34 , " " @entity30 " and " @entity35 " into other songs , complete with a faux - @entity38 strut during the @entity40 classic			2
earlier in the day , @entity42 jazz vocalist @entity41 -- best known for singing the theme song to " @entity44 " -- performed an emotional set that included a mesmerizing version of @entity48 's " @entity47			0
" @entity1 : @entity4 to tour without @entity11 at the other end of the spectrum , rapper @entity49 , the self - proclaimed " queen diva , " walked on the @entity52 with " excuse / i do n't mean to be rude / get out my way and let me do what i do			1
" the biggest name in what 's come to be known as " sissy bounce " -- a sub-genre of @entity42 bounce -- proudly shook her ass with her onstage dancers			1
like much of the music at @entity5 , bounce makes more sense performed at night and in a bar , but @entity49 kicked an element of danger into her music			2
" i got gin in my system , " she rapped			0
" somebody 's gon na be my victim			0
" @entity1 : @entity74 , @entity75 and more rock the @entity5 see the original article at @entity1			0
