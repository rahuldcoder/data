-- my mother and stepfather both held full - time jobs and it was n't unusual for them to work overtime			1
sometimes days would go by when i would n't see my stepfather because he was working a double shift on consecutive days			1
and yet , despite all their hard work , my family struggled to make ends meet			1
sometimes i would have to hurry home to get my homework done before nightfall and an unpaid electric bill put the house in the dark			2
we depended on the cinder blocks of cheese , powdered milk and canned meats encased in saturated fat that the government distributed			2
school clothes shopping typically began and ended at @entity27			0
none of this was unusual in my neighborhood on the east side of @entity32 , so i did n't know then what i know now			1
my cousins who lived nearby were poor			1
most everyone i encountered on my block was poor			2
true , a few of them were lazy and leaned too heavily on the welfare system , while others turned to crime to survive			0
the first time i was mugged i was in elementary school			0
and yes , by saying " the first time , " i am also saying it was not the only time			0
but most adults were like my folks			0
they were sacrificing , hardworking people who wanted one thing : a better life			0
better for themselves , better for their children			0
my story is very similar to that of my partner , whose mother worked hard to feed him and his sister , and that meant peanut butter and jelly sandwiches everyday			1
our stories are similar to that of @entity67 president @entity66 who grew up in the projects in @entity69 and whose father never made more than $ 20,000 a year , or to that of @entity72 , who started off as a poor kid from @entity74 and 46 years later was in the @entity75			2
it is because of all of this that when i think of what it means to be poor in this country , i do n't see a bunch of parasites looking for tax - subsidized handouts			1
i see hardworking people who could use a helping hand			0
i see my mother , who to this day shops at the @entity27 , even though her children can now buy her clothes whenever she wants			0
none of us is rich , but we are the fruit of her years of nonstop labor and inherited the work ethic we saw all around us			1
and if you scan through the biographies of some of this nation 's greatest success stories across every conceivable demographic , you will find people with humble beginnings like mine			2
perhaps you yourself came from little			0
but more important , some people start from humble beginnings and die that way , which is no indication of how hard they did or did n't work , or how good or bad a person they were			1
as we begin the painful work of tightening the belt of a nation that has gotten fat on credit , it is important that we do n't forget : those stories are the reason we are such a great nation			1
the middle class does n't comprise a bunch of affluent people who fell on hard times , but is made up of children and grandchildren of poor people who busted their ass to pull their families up			1
@entity129 and others say the work ethic is absent in neighborhoods like the one i grew up in			1
@entity136 and his like have their collective noses too high up in the air to see this country is n't great in spite of the poor			1
it is great because of the poor			1
i 'm not saying that the richest country in the world should celebrate millions of her children going to bed hungry each night			2
but it should celebrate that so many of these children make it out of poverty and reach back to help those behind			0
they remember what it is like to be hungry			0
to only be recognized for what they do n't have , if they are recognized at all			2
i was walking along the boardwalk in @entity164 , @entity165 , this past weekend enjoying the view of the ocean , while pretending i did n't see the homeless people lying on the beach			2
how ironic to be in southern @entity165 to attend " @entity170 " and too afraid to look another human being in the eye			0
growing up , i did n't do that			1
now that i have a little money in my pocket to make donations and the luxury of time so i can volunteer , i rationalize that i am doing my part			0
and in a way , maybe i am			0
but that should not excuse me , excuse us from having enough decency to simply look another person in the eye			0
or to remember there are faces behind the issues of unemployment benefits and @entity190			0
to remember with 14 million people looking for work , compassion is our greatest weapon against despair			2
when you hear politicians talk about deficits , it 's all about finances			2
but culturally we seem to be in an deficit of empathy as well			0
we have equated the @entity203 with being rich , and now that resources are scarce , the rhetoric has a " kill or be killed " tone to it			0
when i was growing up in @entity32 , it never occurred to me to equate a person 's net worth with his or her worth as a person , or look at it as a snapshot of a value system			1
no one around me did			0
that 's because we saw so many people working hard for a better life			1
with that as your backdrop , it is hard to see poor as a four - letter word			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			1

@entity226 did n't know it growing up , but his family and neighborhood were poor
@entity226 's neighborhood 's work ethic was strong and his parents worked long , hard hours
@entity226 : this country is great because of poor who worked hard and helped others
@entity136 says work ethic is absent in poor neighborhoods , he writes , but that 's just wrong
