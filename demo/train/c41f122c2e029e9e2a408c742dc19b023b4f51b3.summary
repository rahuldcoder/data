@entity0 -- a missing @entity3 researcher , who @entity4 claimed the @entity5 abducted , has sought sanctuary in the @entity7 in @entity0 , a senior @entity9 official and two senior @entity11 diplomatic sources told @entity1 on tuesday			1
" @entity3 scientist @entity12 , who was kidnapped by the @entity9 , had gone to the @entity7 in @entity0 and taken refuge at @entity3 's @entity14			1
he has requested to be sent back to @entity3 quickly , " @entity3 's semi-official news agency @entity15 said tuesday			1
since he is an @entity3 national , the @entity14 will prepare his papers , buy him a ticket and send him home , the @entity11 sources said			2
secretary of state @entity21 said tuesday that @entity12 is in the @entity9 " of his own free will " and is " free to go " back to @entity3			1
she also repeated the @entity9 request that @entity3 release three @entity9 hikers jailed there			1
@entity12 told the @entity9 of his plans to return to @entity3 , and he was scheduled to travel monday but was unable to make the appropriate travel arrangements in time , @entity28 spokesman @entity27 said			1
responding to a question about a potential " prisoner swap , " @entity27 said the @entity9 remains concerned about three @entity9 hikers being held against their will in @entity3 and @entity35 , the former @entity36 agent who disappeared in @entity3 two years ago			1
but he denied any suggestion of a swap			0
last week , the @entity9 returned 10 alleged spies to @entity40 in exchange for four people who had been jailed in @entity40			2
@entity43 , a spokesman for the @entity11 @entity44 , said that @entity12 came to the embassy at 6:30 p.m. monday			2
the @entity11 diplomatic sources said no one in @entity3 was aware of @entity12 's whereabouts until his arrival at the embassy			1
because @entity3 and the @entity9 do not maintain diplomatic ties , the @entity7 looks after @entity3 's interest in @entity0			1
@entity3 's @entity14 is in a separate building on the grounds of the embassy			1
@entity43 said it is controlled and staffed by @entity3 -- with about 70 to 80 @entity3 diplomats			2
@entity11 has no control over the section , @entity43 said , adding that @entity12 was not a guest of , nor was he in the custody or protection of the @entity11 government			2
@entity12 , a researcher at @entity4 's @entity64 , mysteriously disappeared in june 2009 while on a religious pilgrimage to @entity66 , according to @entity3 media reports			1
@entity3 has accused the @entity9 of involvement in @entity12 's disappearance , saying the researcher was taken to force him to give up data about @entity4 's nuclear program			1
but the @entity11 sources said @entity12 is not considered a top scientist in @entity3 and would not be privy to highly sensitive information , so his alleged captors apparently concluded he offered little use to them			1
the @entity28 has denied involvement but has been tight - lipped on whether @entity12 defected and per policy , the @entity5 does not comment on defections			1
but a @entity9 official who is not authorized to speak publicly said @entity12 's actions show the reality of the situation			1
" his multiple videos and now his trip to the @entity86 -- clearly prove he was not held in the @entity9 against his will , " said the @entity9 official			2
" he came to this country freely , he lived here freely , and he has chosen freely to return to @entity3			0
the @entity9 , to be sure , is n't standing in his way			0
he himself gives the lie to the idea he was tortured or imprisoned			0
he can tell any story he wants -- but that wo n't make it true			0
" the @entity9 official also said that @entity12 " may well be feeling some pressure from back home			1
... that could be one explanation for his contradictory messages			0
that said , he 's decided of his own volition to go back , and the @entity9 wo n't stop him			2
he 's been a free man here , and that includes the freedom to make his own choices			0
" on sunday , @entity3 media quoted a top @entity3 lawmaker as saying that newly found documents back up @entity4 's claims that the @entity5 is responsible			1
" the @entity9 move to kidnap @entity12 runs counter to international regulations , " said @entity112 , a member of @entity3 parliament 's @entity114 and @entity113 , the semi-official @entity111 news agency reported			1
he said @entity3 officials had turned over the documents to the @entity120 ambassador in @entity4			0
last month , two videos surfaced on the internet of a man claiming to be @entity12 in which he said he had escaped from @entity9 agents and was hiding in @entity126			1
that was the third time that videos allegedly showing @entity12 had circulated on the internet			0
in one , he said he had been kidnapped by @entity9 agents			2
another contradicted that claim and said he was living freely and studying in @entity132			0
in one of the videos posted june 30 on @entity136 and dated june 14 , the man again said that he was brought against his will to the @entity9 and fears he will be discovered and re-arrested			0
" i am @entity12 , the son of the @entity139 of @entity3 , who with @entity141 's help succeeded in running away from the @entity9 security agents in the state of @entity126			1
i am [ temporarily ] at a safe place and i am trying to do this video but it is quite possible that i may shortly be again arrested by @entity9 security agents			0
" he went on to say : " i am not free here and not allowed to contact my family or other people			0
if i face any problems or if i do not return to my country soon , the government of the @entity9 would be directly responsible for it			0
" @entity1 could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos nor the identity of the man in them			0
" if he is who people think he is , the @entity9 would be in contact with the person , " a @entity5 official said last month			0
and if he were being held against his will , " how would he have been able to produce any of the videos ? " the official asked			0
in the second video that surfaced june 30 and dated june 23 , the man claiming to be @entity12 reassures his family about his well - being			2
" i want to let my beloved family know that i am ok and they should not worry about my health , " he says			0
" with @entity141 's help i shall return to my beloved country in the next few days			0
i want them to be , as always , strong and patient and to pray for my safe return			0
i hope to see you in our beloved country			0
" @entity4 blamed @entity0 for @entity12 's disappearance shortly after revelations surfaced that @entity3 has been building a second uranium enrichment facility near the city of @entity187			1
after that , tensions over @entity3 's nuclear program mounted			1
@entity3 says its nuclear energy is solely for civilian purposes			2
but the @entity9 pushed the @entity193 to punish @entity4 for its nuclear ambitions			2
the @entity195 recently slapped a fourth round of tough sanctions on the @entity199 republic			0
@entity1 's @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to this report .			0
