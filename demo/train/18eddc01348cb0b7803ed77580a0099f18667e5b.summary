@entity2 chief @entity1 should be acquitted of aggravated pimping charges because of insufficient evidence , a prosecutor told a @entity7 criminal court tuesday at the trial of the onetime potential contender for the @entity7 presidency			1
the @entity15 prosecutor 's stance on the case -- in which investigators argued that @entity1 organized or encouraged sex parties involving prostitutes -- is n't new			1
his office said in 2013 that evidence did n't support the charges , but investigative magistrates nevertheless pursued the case to trial , which began two weeks ago			1
" was ( @entity1 ) an organizer of these evenings ? the answer is no. he did not give instructions , " @entity15 prosecutor @entity26 said , according to @entity5 affiliate @entity27			1
" has ( he ) benefited financially from prostitution ? the answer is no. has he paid prostitutes ? the answer is no. " neither the investigation nor the trial supports the pimping charges , @entity26 said			1
investigators alleged that the sex parties , in locations such as @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , stemmed from a prostitution ring , organized from the @entity46 in @entity15			0
@entity1 , who was married to @entity7 tv journalist @entity47 until their divorce in 2013 , has never denied that he took part in the parties			1
but the crux of his defense is that he did not know that prostitutes were involved			2
in testimony last week , he acknowledged that the sexual encounters were organized in such a way that they could fit his agenda , but he denied organizing the parties or knowing that the women involved in the parties were prostitutes			2
" i do n't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever , " he said last week , adding that he had never asked anyone to organize parties for him			0
in @entity7 , prostitution is legal , but pimping is not			0
prosecutors allege that two other defendants , businessman @entity70 and @entity71 , a businessman friend of the former @entity73 director , picked up the bills for the sex parties			0
@entity1 saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in @entity42 in 2011			2
he was later cleared of the @entity42 allegations			0
before that scandal erupted , he had been on track to run for the @entity7 presidency -- an election that his @entity85 later won with @entity86 as its candidate			0
the @entity15 prosecutor 's office in late 2013 asked for @entity1 's case to be dismissed , citing a lack of evidence			1
however , the investigating magistrates did not follow its recommendations			0
a judgment in the case could come " within months , " @entity26 's spokeswoman , @entity95 , said tuesday			2
@entity98 contributed to this report .			0

" has ( @entity1 ) paid prostitutes ? the answer is no , " prosecutor says
the prosecutor 's office has long said there was n't enough evidence to pursue the case
but investigative magistrates pursed case against him and others ; trial began earlier this month
