-- @entity2 's foreign mnister @entity1 on monday asserted that the situation in his country " is almost like ... a war			1
" with @entity8 forces effectively having taken control of @entity10 , this is @entity11 's biggest geopolitical crisis for at least two decades			1
@entity8 is currently drafting counter-proposals to a @entity14 plan for a negotiated solution			1
this will seek to challenge @entity18 's support for the new government in @entity20 that @entity21 believes was installed in a coup and has plunged a significant part of the country into chaos			0
from @entity18 's perspective , @entity8 troops ( up to 25,000 would normally be stationed in @entity10 , according to @entity8 state media , but it 's unclear how many are in the region now			2
@entity31 authorities have said more @entity8 soldiers have come into @entity10 ) must pull back from @entity2			1
@entity14 secretary of state @entity34 is also attempting to secure support for the placement of international monitors , and has also called for @entity21 to use its influence to stop the march 16 referendum in @entity10 ( which was annexed into the @entity2 in 1956 by @entity42 leader @entity41 ) on whether it should join the @entity8			1
in seeking to frame @entity8 's actions in @entity10 , various historical analogies with @entity45 have been made , including last week by former @entity14 secretary of state @entity47			1
the use of analogies by politicians in international crises is commonplace			1
in the complexity and uncertainty of fast moving day - to - day events , policymakers often seek to draw what they perceive as key lessons of the past in seeking to guide and provide rationales for their actions			0
for much of the period since the 1970s , for instance , many @entity14 officials were fearful of " another @entity64 " referring to the disastrous @entity14 intervention in that @entity67 country			2
this tended to reduce willingness to deploy @entity14 military force internationally unless any action ( such as the @entity72 ) had clear , attainable objectives that could swiftly be achieved with a minimum of casualties			2
the @entity64 debacle also became a key frame of reference when the @entity14 - led intervention in @entity80 faltered after 2003			0
this was despite the fact that the two experiences ( @entity80 and @entity64 ) were dissimilar in many respects , including the nature of the insurgencies , and @entity14 objectives in each country			0
however , the most widely used historical analogy is that of @entity90 and @entity45			1
the widely seen implication for foreign affairs of the ill - fated 1938 @entity95 - @entity94 agreement with @entity96 is that appeasement with aggressors does n't work			0
numerous politicians claim to have been influenced by @entity90 , including @entity100 during the " war - on - terror , " @entity101 over the @entity103 conflict , @entity104 concerning @entity64 , @entity105 and @entity106 during the @entity108 crisis , and @entity109 over @entity110			1
moreover , the continuing salience of @entity90 is illustrated by the fact that , only last month , @entity115 president @entity114 compared what he claimed was @entity118 's recent belligerent behaviour with @entity45 's expansionism by openly questioning " at what point do you say , ' enough is enough ? ' " while military action appears to have been ruled out by @entity126 policymakers in @entity2 , the fact that @entity90 is informing the thinking of some politicians is reflected in @entity128 's comments last week			1
she noted that " the claims by president @entity132 and other @entity8 that they had to go into @entity10 and maybe further into @entity2 because they had to protect the @entity8 minorities , this is reminiscent of claims that were made back in the 1930s when @entity45 under the @entity136 kept talking about how they had to protect @entity139 minorities in @entity140 and @entity141 and elsewhere throughout @entity11			1
i just want everybody to have a little historic perspective			0
" these remarks , which were qualified by @entity128 , have been supported by leading @entity146 senators @entity145 , the party 's 2008 presidential nominee , and @entity149 , who is widely anticipated to run for president in 2016			0
@entity145 has gone even further , asserting that the emboldened stance of @entity8 in @entity10 reflects the " fecklessness " of the @entity155 administration 's foreign policy			2
while some see very strong similarities between @entity8 's incursion into @entity2 , and @entity45 's expansionism , the fact remains that use of analogies can be fraught with difficulty for policymakers			1
on a fundamental level , for instance , not all military actions end up like @entity64 , while not all diplomatic agreements turn out like @entity90			0
as history shows , there is thus a danger that policymakers misinterpret past crises just as frequently as they learn the right lessons			0
for instance , @entity108 and @entity64 underscore how @entity90 was used to guide or justify major foreign policy blunders by the @entity14 , the @entity95 and @entity94 in the 1950s and 1960s			2
another example is @entity14 president @entity177 during the @entity178 who was influenced by @entity181 's " @entity182 " book			2
this argued that @entity184 started as a result of miscalculation and mistakes from all sides			0
@entity177 believed the events of october 1962 were reminiscent of the lead - up to that conflict and , wisely , sought to deploy a range of diplomatic options with the @entity42 , overruling advice of military advisers for a quick military strike on @entity197			0
however , an increasing number of academics now believe that @entity45 actively sought war , and that @entity181 's thesis is wrong			2
in this sense , it has been argued that @entity177 's actions ( which were prudent in the context of @entity197 , and may have saved the world from nuclear war ) were based on a misreading of @entity184 history			0
in the case of @entity2 , @entity90 is by no means the only historical lens through which to interpret what is happening in the country			1
and , even if it were , there are clear differences between the 1930s and today , including in the interdependence of the global economy , wider dissimilarities in the global balance of power , and the fact that @entity8 has an extensive stockpile of nuclear weapons			0
in the unpredictability and tension of the current moment , it is certainly the case that , like @entity177 in 1962 , calm , clear and careful decision - making is now needed by @entity126 ( and indeed @entity31 ) politicians as they think through the array of non-military options they have at their disposal , including sanctions			0
history can provide an especially useful framework in addressing similar or identical policy challenges , but to avoid potentially major misjudgement attention also needs to be given by policymakers to any significant differences between past and present conditions			0
