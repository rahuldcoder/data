-- @entity1 and @entity2 still spend their days outside the @entity4 in @entity5 , standing vigil for their son , @entity7 , whose mysterious death a year ago poses many questions in their minds			1
they simply want to know how their son ended up in a rolled - up mat in his high school 's gymnasium on january 10 , 2013 ; his body was found a day later , when students in a gym class glimpsed his feet in the mat. the original investigation by the @entity24 concluded that 17 - year - old @entity25 died by accident while reaching for a shoe , but the @entity28 do n't believe that			1
they 're planning yet another rally in @entity33 's @entity32 at noon saturday to again demand answers			0
" they know something happened in that gym and they do n't want it to come out , " @entity35 said			0
federal authorities , too , have their doubts about the original investigation 's findings			1
@entity0 has learned that the @entity45 has been in @entity46 conducting interviews , and the @entity48 recently spent almost three hours with investigators at an @entity45 field office in @entity51 , an hour west of their hometown			0
@entity55 @entity54 said in november that federal authorities would investigate @entity2 's death , and last month , the @entity45 seized the original hard drives from the surveillance system at @entity60 , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation surrounding the hard drives			1
the federal investigation has yielded few details , but @entity54 issued a statement thursday : " as we approach the anniversary of @entity7 's death , i am mindful that there is a great deal of interest in the status of our efforts			1
as i have previously stated , in order to protect the integrity of any ongoing investigation by my office , i typically refrain from making any specific comments about the investigation until it is concluded			0
as we continue our work in this matter , my thoughts and prayers will be with the @entity2 family this weekend			2
" the @entity24 has n't commented on every twist and turn in the case but has repeatedly stood by its investigation			2
" it was not a rash decision that was leapt to			0
we 've drawn this out , done a thorough investigation , and we think we 've covered all bases , " lt. @entity94 told @entity0 in may , the day after investigators closed the case			1
on friday , the office released a statement through its attorney , saying , " we continue to support mr. @entity54 's interest in these tragic circumstances and applaud his urging of the community to come forward with facts and evidence rather than feelings or opinions , no matter how sincere they may be			0
" the @entity24 said it had interviewed more than 100 people -- students , teachers and parents among them -- but the timing of those interviews raises questions for at least one analyst			0
@entity0 examined the 522 - page police file and found that investigators spoke to 111 people			2
eighteen of those interviews occurred the day @entity2 's body was found , and another 15 people were interviewed later that month			1
investigators then spoke to five more people in february and march before conducting interviews with 72 people in april , about the time media coverage of @entity2 's death gained momentum			1
one person was interviewed in may , according to the investigative file			0
former @entity135 detective @entity134 , an analyst for @entity0 's sister network , @entity136 , said that if he were involved in the investigation , he would " want to interview someone that day , that night or maybe the following day while things are still fresh in their mind			2
" the first responders were n't interviewed until april 17 , according to the file , and the paramedic who noticed bruising on @entity2 's jaw -- and considered the gym to be a crime scene -- was n't interviewed until april 18			1
investigators did n't speak to the janitors who cleaned the gym until april 26			2
asked why the bulk of the interviews were n't conducted until april , the @entity24 said , in the statement released by its attorney , that " sheriff ( chris ) @entity154 maintains every confidence that his office 's investigation was timely and properly prioritized and handled with the necessary diligence to assure that all leads were examined and exhausted and he welcomes the @entity162 attorney 's continued review of the case			1
" surveillance video shows other students in the gym with @entity2 before he died , but according to local investigators ' reports , there 's no record of interviews with any of them , although they spoke to more than 90 students			1
" i looked at the crime scene investigation , evidence collection , the autopsy , the interviews that were done and were not done in a timely fashion			2
this is a sloppy case from the get - go , " @entity134 said			0
the @entity24 noted that it provided its investigative files to @entity0 in may , but the names in that file were redacted			0
@entity0 did not receive the unamended version until october 30 , and the network did not receive the surveillance video until november 6			0
@entity0 's @entity189 contributed to this report .			0

new : original investigation was " timely and properly prioritized and handled , " investigators say
@entity5 teen was found dead , rolled in a gym mat , nearly a year ago
@entity198 ruled the death an accident last year
@entity2 's parents think there 's more to the case ; a federal investigation is in *progress*
