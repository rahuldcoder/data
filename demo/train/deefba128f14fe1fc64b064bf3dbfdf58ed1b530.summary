-- " no ma'am ... i will not register my weapons			1
" these passionate words from a @entity5 sparked an insatiable conversation on @entity0			1
since @entity9 posted an open letter to @entity12 sen. @entity11 , @entity13 , dismissing stricter gun control , on @entity15 , his commentary has received more than 1 million views , almost 30,000 comments and even a response from @entity11 's office			1
but one response stood out from the rest -- a reaction from another @entity5 addressed directly to @entity23			1
@entity24 called @entity23 's letter an " embarrassment to those who 've served			1
" the two views on gun control were as different as the photos adorning the letters , @entity23 wielding a firearm and @entity24 pointing a video camera			1
prompted by the firestorm of discussion the two have sparked , we interviewed both men with the same set of questions to further explain their opposing views on gun control			1
read their responses and judge their arguments for yourself : 1			1
what do you think our founding fathers meant by the right " to keep and bear arms " mentioned in the @entity49 ? @entity23 : they had just fought a war against a government that had overstepped its boundaries			2
you can only come to the conclusion that they put it there for us to have the same ability to do that in the future should the need arise			2
they use the terms people , militia and arms specifically			2
they differentiate between the @entity12 , the states and the people elsewhere			2
i think they use the term arms because they mean any weapons that we might have to bear in such a situation			2
@entity76 : i think that because we had a much smaller military at the time , it was more of an allowance that people could have weapons or muskets to raise a militia to defend the country from outside invasion			2
but in today 's world , we have a much larger military and the weapons that are available are much more dangerous than the weapons of that time			1
i would think that the founding fathers would not make as broad of an allowance of individual possession of firearms if they knew what the state of firearms was today			2
what if a new bill about banning assault weapons passes , say sen. @entity11 's bill ? what would it mean for @entity12 ? @entity23 : it 's going to open a door that we , or our descendants , are going to deplore			1
it 's saying it 's ok to take away guns away based on the actions of a few			1
the next time somebody goes up the tower at the @entity116 shooting people with a deer rifle , it will show our willingness to give away hunting rifles			2
and after the next @entity122 , handguns are going to be taken away			2
these shootings have happened before ; they just do n't have the same emotional weight as this shooting had			2
@entity76 : i do n't think it would really harm gun owners as they think it would			2
they would still have access to all sorts of hunting weapons and rifles			2
the bill only seeks to ban assault weapons			2
unless we had a bill like the one passed in @entity139 in 1996 , a retroactive ban , we would still have all these weapons out there			1
unless such a ban is instituted , it will probably not be as effective as we hope			0
nevertheless , i do support any step taken in limiting assault weapons			0
what 's the biggest misconception that you think people have about your stance on guns ? @entity23 : there 's a few of them			1
they think i 'm paranoid			0
i just learned early on that you have to expect the worst while hoping for the best			0
expecting that the best is going to happen when hard times show up you wo n't be prepared and you will fail			0
people assume because i own guns that i 'm not educated or that i do n't know how to think for myself			1
i own guns because i 'm educated to the dangers and the reality of the world that we live in			1
i accept the reality that we live in and i do n't accept that the police will always be there for me			0
i own guns because i 'm very much attached to reality			1
@entity76 : i think , based on what i 've read , people just have the perception that i think that gun owners are evil or do n't care about gun violence			0
i realize that 's not true , but i just think that people are very eager to talk about their rights but not always so eager to talk about collective responsibility and safety			1
also , i want to set straight that i do n't think @entity179 is a disgrace at all			0
i just think that his letter could have been more sensitive to the issues			1
i respect him and his service ; i was n't trying to personally attack him			0
what should the @entity12 do to keep guns out of the wrong hands ( like criminals ) ? @entity23 : criminals are going to do what they want to do			1
we have to accept that			0
we can make all the laws that we want , but it 's not going to stop [ people ] from breaking them			1
we have laws to prevent that from happening			0
just as keeping drugs out of peoples ' hands does n't solve the drug war , gun control is not going to keep guns out of peoples ' hands			1
the majority of crime is committed with illegally acquired weapons in the first place			0
what we can do is remove the restriction levels for law - abiding citizens who want to defend themselves			1
this idea of a gun - free zone has never stopped a shooting			0
people never walk up to a school and say , ' this is a gun - free zone , so i 'm going to go shoot somewhere else			0
' it 's never happened			1
@entity76 : we need to enforce background checks , not just at commercial retailers but also at gun shows			0
we need to limit the sale of dangerous weapons to people who have no record of criminal history			0
we need to perhaps consider enacting some kind of mental screening or wellness testing before people are allowed to purchase weapons as well			0
it might offend people because it would infringe upon their rights , but we need to consider if that would outweigh the benefits brought to society by not allowing weapons to go into the hands of the mentally ill. 5			0
why were there so many mass shootings in 2012 ( @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , and @entity251 , @entity252 ) ? what do you think is to blame ? @entity23 : humanity			0
we as a species have faults and we still have wars with each other			0
i can still hear atrocities happening around the globe			0
... it 's not because of a simple object that propels a projectile			1
it 's because of us			1
we refuse to look at the root of the issue because it scares us			0
we give into fear and play to our emotions and we move to outlaw something that is not a cause , but just a means			0
i 'm not a psychiatrist			0
i could n't tell you why there are so many			0
there 's a deeper problem here			1
these kinds of things , and not just mass shootings , happen all over the globe ; it 's not a problem specific to @entity12			1
@entity76 : based upon just what i 've read on the shootings , it appears that at least a couple of them are mentally disturbed in some way and they had access to these weapons			0
when the @entity296 expired , people were allowed to purchase them again			0
when the mentally ill have access to them , it 's inevitable that these tragedies are going to happen			1
it 's very sad to me that not even @entity247 took us to these discussions			2
it took the murder of 20 children before we were again willing to look at our gun laws and wonder whether or not we should make changes			0
who do you think had the better answers , @entity23 or @entity24 ? share your thoughts in the comments below .			0
