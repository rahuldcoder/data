@entity0 -- longtime @entity4 reporter @entity3 has retired effective immediately , @entity2 said monday			1
the media conglomerate had employed @entity6 as a syndicated columnist for its newspaper chain			1
her retirement comes amid a furor created last week by her controversial comments regarding @entity14 people			1
@entity6 , 89 , was considered the dean of the @entity4 press corps , as she was the longest - serving @entity4 journalist			1
she has been reporting on administrations since 1960 , when she began covering then - president - elect @entity18 and his family			1
@entity6 , had come under fire late last week when a @entity22 video surfaced showing her saying that @entity26 should " get the hell out of @entity25 , " and that the @entity14 people should go home to " @entity28 , @entity29 ... and @entity30 and everywhere else			1
" in a posting on her website friday , @entity6 apologized for her remarks			1
" they do not reflect my heart - felt belief that peace will come to the @entity39 only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance			0
may that day come soon , " she wrote			0
but the apology was not enough to silence critics , who began a rising chorus of calls for @entity6 either to be terminated or suspended by @entity2			2
just prior to @entity2 's announcement , the board of the @entity50 released a statement condemning @entity6 ' remarks			1
the group of @entity4 reporters , which includes @entity1 's @entity56 , called @entity6 ' remarks " indefensible			1
" the reporters ' statement said , " many in our profession who have known @entity3 for years were saddened by the comments , which were especially unfortunate in light of her role as a trailblazer on the @entity4 beat			1
" and during a monday morning briefing , @entity4 press secretary @entity66 also criticized @entity6 , saying , " those remarks were offensive and reprehensible			1
i think she should and has apologized because obviously those remarks do not reflect the -- certainly the opinion of , i assume , most of the people in here and certainly not of the administration			2
" on sunday , former white house counsel @entity75 was among those calling for @entity2 to take action against @entity6			2
she was also dropped by her agent , @entity78 , on sunday , and @entity79 , who co-authored " @entity81 , mr. president " with @entity6 , said in a blog post that he " will no longer be working with @entity3 on our book projects			2
" @entity6 , who is of @entity89 descent , made the comments to rabbi @entity91 of @entity92 , who told @entity1 his hand - held camera was in plain sight on may 27 when he asked her for " any comments on @entity26 ? " " tell them to get the hell out of @entity25 , " she responded			1
" any better comments on @entity26 ? " @entity91 asked			2
@entity6 replied , " remember , these people are occupied and it 's their land , it 's not @entity29			2
" @entity91 asked where the @entity14 should go , and @entity6 responded , " they should go home , " which the @entity4 reporter identified as " @entity28 , @entity29 ... and @entity30 and everywhere else			1
" " this is a story about the power of video , " @entity91 said monday			0
" this issue was anti-semitism , within 24 hours over a million views , we find out that someone who 's been reporting for 60 years , this is what she 's about			0
" the rabbi said @entity6 ' website statement was n't enough and that she owes the @entity14 community an apology			1
" my initial reaction is she can retire from her job but she ca n't retire from her responsibility to apologize for her comments , " @entity91 said			0
" there 's a difference between telling your opinion and giving someone the finger , which is what she did			2
" the @entity134 said in a written statement that @entity6 ' apology " does not go far enough			2
" " her remarks were outrageous , offensive and inappropriate , " @entity134 national director @entity137 said in the statement			0
" her suggestion that @entity26 should go back to @entity28 and @entity29 is bigoted and shows a profound ignorance of history			0
we believe @entity6 needs to make a more forceful and sincere apology for the pain her remarks have caused			1
" her apology also was not enough for @entity75 , who served as special counsel to former president @entity151			0
" @entity3 , who i used to consider a close friend and who i used to respect , has showed herself to be an anti-semitic bigot , " @entity75 said			0
" this is not about her disagreement about her criticisms of @entity26			0
she has a right to criticize @entity26 and that is not the same as being an anti-semite			0
" @entity75 added , " if she had asked all blacks to go back to @entity163 , what would the @entity50 position be as to whether she deserved @entity4 press room credentials -- much less a privileged honorary seat ? " @entity167 , who served as press secretary for former president @entity169 , also said @entity6 should be fired because of her remarks			1
he reiterated that demand in a statement provided to @entity1 sunday			0
" @entity3 's statement calling for the religious cleansing of @entity26 is reprehensible , " @entity167 said			0
" if this is n't bigotry , what is ? what she said is as bad as someone saying all blacks should leave @entity30 and go back to @entity163			0
" " @entity2 should do the right thing and let @entity3 go , " @entity167 added in the statement			0
@entity1 's @entity184 contributed to this report .			0
