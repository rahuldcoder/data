with racial issues and policing headlining the political conversation in @entity4 in the midst of nationwide protests and the murder of two police officers in @entity9 , president @entity0 said he believes the issue of race relations is surfacing " in a way that probably is healthy			1
" @entity0 welcomed the attention race relations and policing in minority communities have attracted recently and said he believes there will be " progress " on those issues in the next year as a result of the task force of police , community leaders and activists he assembled this year			2
" i actually think that [ the @entity4 is ] probably in its day - to - day interactions less racially divided , " @entity0 said in an interview with @entity26 released monday and recorded before his family vacation in @entity28			1
" the issue of police and communities of color being mistrustful of each other is hardly new ; that dates back a long time			0
it 's just something that has n't been talked about			0
" @entity0 spoke out after two white police officers who each killed an unarmed black man were not indicted by two separate grand juries in recent months , empathizing with protesters and urging them to remain non-violent			0
but race relations were n't the only topic of discussion when @entity0 sat down with @entity26 for a wide - ranging 40 - minute interview , in which , he reflected on six years in office and looked forward toward the final two			0
@entity0 signaled that 2014 marked a shift in his presidency with the economy showing significant signs of recovery and as the health care law has begun to bear its fruits , calling gains from his administration 's policies " liberating			1
" now , @entity0 can stop putting out the fires and " focus on some long - term projects " and consolidating the gains of his first six years in office -- and perhaps his legacy			1
@entity0 called his signature health care law a " big lift with significant political cost , " but said the country is now seeing " it 's paid off			1
" and that will be one achievement he will look to defend from a @entity67 that could define his final two years in the @entity68			0
@entity0 , who said he was " frustrated " with the midterm results , said he would look for common ground with @entity67 legislators , but would n't shy away from using his veto power to defend his health care legislation and " gains that we 've made on environment and clean air and clean water " -- a significant statement given that the next @entity67 will take up the environmentalist - opposed @entity76 pipeline project as their first vote next year			1
the president has n't yet decided whether he 'll veto the pipeline			0
while @entity0 flaunted economic gains at home , from deficit reductions to job growth , he also touted @entity4 gains in the international arena -- from handling @entity92 to fighting @entity93			1
" wherever we have been involved over the last several years , i think the outcome has been better because of @entity4 leadership , " @entity0 said			1
" one of the things i 've learned over six years -- and it does n't always suit the news cycle -- is having some strategic patience			0
" while @entity0 has taken flak in recent years for being too soft in confronting @entity92 aggression in @entity105 -- including its annexation of @entity108 -- @entity0 pointed to the ongoing collapse of @entity92 's economy as a sign of his strategic fortitude			0
plummeting oil prices are largely responsible for @entity92 's nosedive into economic recession , but @entity4 sanctions over the last year have also played their part and @entity0 insisted that those sanctions set the foundation to ensure eventual fluctuations in the oil market would hit @entity92 hard			2
@entity0 said in an interview with @entity123 this month that his @entity92 counterpart , president @entity124 , is no " chess master " and did n't outmaneuver the @entity4 as some pundits had suggested			0
in fact , @entity0 said he believes the @entity4 does n't ' " really have a serious peer , at least on the conventional level , " today			1
the president also reaffirmed his opposition to his predecessor 's nation - building policies in @entity134 , saying he believes the @entity4 " can help , but we ca n't do it for them " in countries like @entity134 , @entity138 and @entity139			0
sure to learn from the backlash he faced after he likened @entity141 to a " jayvee team " last january , @entity0 said the @entity4 " ca n't underestimate the danger of @entity141 , " but noted that " it 's not the only danger we have " and said the @entity4 should focus on spending money at home rather than committing " another trillion dollars " to fighting the militant @entity148 group			2
and with his decision this month to normalize relations with @entity153 and establish an embassy in @entity155 , @entity0 was asked about another so - called " rogue " state that @entity0 has sought to engage : @entity157			2
so what about an embassy in @entity160 , @entity157 's capital ? " i never say never , but i think these things have to go in steps , " @entity0 said , noting that the @entity153 decision came after more than a 50 - year policy that has failed to change the politics of @entity153			1
@entity157 is different , though , @entity0 said , because it has a " track record of state - sponsored terrorism " and has displayed fervently anti-american rhetoric and made " incendiary " threats toward @entity168			2
" there 's a lot of history there that 's different from the history between us and @entity153 , " @entity0 said .			0

@entity0 said he believes the @entity4 is " less raciallly divided " today
and with the economy gaining , @entity0 said he 'll look to focus on " long - term projects " in the next year
he 'll also defend his health care law , while working with the @entity184 to find common ground
@entity0 also touted @entity4 leadership *abroad* , and discussed the prospects of an embassy in @entity157
