-- hundreds of @entity1 packed a courtroom in @entity3 on monday as three top @entity5 leaders went on trial for their role during the bloody four - year regime in the mid- 1970s			1
the @entity10 - backed @entity9 has scheduled four days of opening statements for the defendants , who are all in their 80s			1
on trial are @entity15 , the former @entity5 foreign minister ; @entity16 , the nominal head of state ; and @entity18 , the prime minister , also known as brother @entity18			2
the head of the @entity5 , @entity20 , was known as brother number 1			2
he died in 1998 , long before the @entity10 - backed court came into existence			0
a fourth defendant , @entity25 , was ruled unfit to stand trial because she suffers from dementia and could be set free , prosecutor said			1
she is @entity15 's wife and served as the social affairs ministry during the regime			0
prosecutors have charged the defendants with crimes against humanity , grave breaches of the @entity35 , genocide , homicide , torture and religious persecution			1
under @entity20 's leadership , the @entity5 regime was responsible for the deaths of millions of ordinary @entity1 during a four - year reign of terror that was eventually halted in 1979 by invading @entity45 forces			1
in 1975 , the @entity5 ordered people out of @entity3 , the capital , and other cities in @entity1 to work in the countryside			2
it is said to be responsible for about 1.7 million deaths , roughly a quarter of the population at the time			1
its stated aim was to create a @entity55 utopia , but instead the regime forced @entity1 into what has been described as a living hell			0
soldiers marched city - dwellers into the countryside and forced them to work as farm laborers			0
those already living in rural @entity1 were expected to produce enough food for the country while teaching farming to those who had never done it before			0
the regime abolished currency , and considered anyone with an education a threat			0
it did not allow modern medicine , and it isolated @entity1 to make it completely self - sufficient			0
the results were disastrous : people died of starvation and disease as soldiers tortured and killed anyone suspected of being disloyal			1
in the end , virtually everyone , including the soldiers , became a target due to the leadership 's paranoia .			0

the three defendants are all in their 80s
a fourth defendant has been ruled unfit to stand trial for dementia
they are charged with crimes against humanity
during the four - year @entity5 rule , about 1.7 million people died
