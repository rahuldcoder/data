-- smaller tablet computers that are significantly more affordable and portable than the @entity2 are finally starting to hit the @entity3 -- and they could hit a crucial sweet spot in the consumer market			1
recently @entity7 announced the new @entity8 , which costs $ 200			0
that 's the same price as @entity11 's recently announced @entity10			0
the @entity8 starts shipping friday , while the @entity10 wo n't start shipping until november 15			0
the @entity13 , which costs about $ 250 , is already available in stores and online			0
although marketed mainly as e-book readers , all three of these consumer devices are actually small tablet computers ( 7 inches ) that run the @entity21 mobile operating system and use @entity22 -- no carrier data plan or contract required			1
so theoretically , they can do much more than just let you buy and read e-books			0
this makes them potentially powerful tools for people who want access to the @entity33 , apps and more -- especially people who face economic or other barriers to using smartphones or computers			1
small , inexpensive , easy - to - use tablets could become an important bridge to help people cross the digital divide and gain expanded access to education , jobs , community , and other resources			1
the grand vision of tablet computers is that , ideally , they 'll allow the average , non-geeky person to do most of what can be done with a laptop computer -- in a way that 's much easier to learn , use and carry around			1
certainly this is the case with @entity57 's @entity2 , which sold 11 million units in the last quarter alone			0
but at this point , @entity2 start at $ 500 -- about what you might pay for a brand new 32 - inch flat - screen tv at @entity63 , and twice or more what pc netbooks cost at most retail stores			2
from the perspective of typical consumers , especially given the current economy , that 's a significant luxury investment			2
this month there are fresh rumors that @entity57 may be planning to introduce a smaller and less costly " ipad mini			0
" but nothing is confirmed , so do n't hold your breath			0
the tablet market is growing fast , and its dynamics are shifting quickly			2
according to a new report from @entity80 , in the last year @entity21 tablets grew from 2 % of the global tablet market to 27 %			1
meanwhile , the @entity2 's global tablet market share has dropped from 96 % to 67 %			1
that does n't reflect a decrease in the @entity2 's popularity , but rather that consumer demand for tablets is not one - size - fits - all			1
in fact , size is a key issue for people shopping for tablets			1
the @entity2 measures roughly 7 - by - 10 inches -- too big for a typical pocket or purse , and nearly twice the size of the basic @entity8 , @entity13 and @entity10 models			2
digital devices that are n't as easy to carry around tend to mainly get used only at certain times of day , in certain settings			2
for this reason it 's questionable how " mobile " larger tablets like the @entity2 really are			2
aside from the @entity105 , @entity10 , and @entity13 , there are lots of other small @entity21 tablets available			1
but so far these products have faced various challenges in the consumer market : cost : the @entity22 - only version of @entity113 's 7 - inch @entity112 costs about $ 350 , which is on the pricier side			1
the carrier - branded versions cost much less to buy up front if you agree to a two - year contract			1
for instance , @entity119 currently sells the 7 - inch @entity112 for just $ 200 , but data plans cost $ 30 - $ 80 per month , and there 's a $ 350 early termination fee			2
@entity124 , publisher of the @entity126 and @entity127 , is selling a small @entity21 tablet by @entity129 for just $ 99 - $ 129 in a small pilot program -- but for that bargain - basement price you have to agree to a one - or two - year newspaper subscription , costing up to $ 13 per month			1
device quality : this is an issue for the cheapest tablets			2
for instance , one reviewer noted that the touchscreen performance on the @entity140 tablet is less than stellar			0
in contrast , the @entity13 has been getting generally favorable reviews for device quality			0
the advance kindle fire reviews are also mostly positive			0
@entity21 's learning curve : this can be an obstacle for some			1
the straightforward @entity21 experience that comes with tablets by @entity113 , @entity151 , @entity152 , and other manufacturers can be daunting to typical consumers -- especially the majority of @entity3 consumers who do n't yet own a smartphone			1
a more constrained but dependable out - of - the - box user experience can be simpler to learn and can make the average consumer happier , at least initially			2
gadgets that are more complex or open - ended tend to confuse or frustrate average consumers -- which generally is n't good for sales			1
despite the high relative cost of @entity57 devices , and the fairly closed nature of the @entity57 ecosystem , there 's a lot to be said for " it just works			0
" however , most " pure " @entity21 tablets do offer one key advantage over constrained e-reader tablets : direct access to @entity174 's @entity173 , where there 's a virtually unlimited choice of apps			1
the @entity10 , @entity13 , and @entity140 tablets only offer apps through their own markets , not the @entity173 , which means they can block the installation of competing apps , such those from other e-book vendors or publishers			0
also , even though @entity7 touts that its @entity105 will offer access to " over 15,000 apps , " the company has not clarified whether that will be through the @entity173 or its own app store			0
which means it 's possible that you may not be able to install the @entity10 e-reader app on the @entity8 -- at least , not without " rooting " the tablet to remove vendor controls , which can be a formidable technical hurdle			0
the coming year -- especially the 2011 holiday season -- will probably indicate whether smaller tablets will play a leading role in the @entity3 digital media landscape			1
if these devices start becoming as commonplace as iphones and @entity204 , they may become popular and powerful tools for the delivery of mobile services for health , education , jobs , and more			0
sure , you can use a small , cheap tablet to read books , watch @entity214 , and play " @entity215			0
" but maybe someday lots of people will be using these devices to get a college degree -- or perhaps to learn to read in the first place			0
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity222 .			0

tablets let people do what can be done on a laptop in an easier way
in the last year @entity21 tablets grew from 2 % in the global market to 27 %
gadgets that are more complex or open - ended tend to frustrate most consumers
