-- you 've probably heard of @entity2 -- well , this is more like glorious driftwood			2
galloping along beaches or drinking quietly from a pool , these majestic horses are n't what they first seem			0
that 's because , not that long ago , they were just piles of what seemed like scrap wood -- until , that is , artist @entity13 began working his magic			1
born in @entity17 , the 46 - year - old has lived in the @entity18 since traveling there for what was supposed to have been an extended holiday in 1989			1
" i was entranced by the countryside , the beaches , the wildlife and the people , with their flair for color and artistry , " he explained			0
he 's long been using driftwood collected from the seas , beaches and rivers near his @entity33 home to create his breathtaking wildlife art , and @entity13 's work is a continuation of a childhood fascination with crafting wooden models and miniature sculptures			1
much time in his formative years was spent in the workshops of his parent 's antiques restoration firm , giving him a thorough informal education in the arts of craftsmanship			1
that accumulated knowledge of flair and polish is on display in his three thoroughbreds , all equine power and elegance and his biggest public art project to date			2
inspired by the fact that this is the @entity59 , they were commissioned for @entity61 celebrations at the @entity63 nature park in @entity64 , where they were even " ridden " by model jousters for a while			1
the logistics of creating each horse were daunting			0
a metal frame provides the equivalent of the animal 's skeleton , with hundreds of pieces of driftwood going into each sculpture			1
the larger pieces are then bolted together and the bolts welded to the frame , with each smaller piece then painstakingly screwed into place			2
" this wood has been dead for more than 50 years , " @entity13 told @entity0			1
" it has weathered over those decades , and that 's what makes it look so fantastic			0
" i was always an outdoor type of person , and would come across these wonderful pieces of wood while out kayaking -- i have been collecting driftwood since i was 18 , and have enough stockpiled to be able to find , in the end , all the right pieces			1
" i 'll go on a hunt for a piece for a nostril or eyebrow , but i 'll come across a potential hoof instead			0
it 's like a jigsaw puzzle : you keep on looking until you 've found the right piece			0
" also , people know the sort of wood i use now and they 'll bring it to me , " added @entity13 , who pays them , putting money into villages where incomes can often be precarious at best			1
" but sometimes i 'll think i 've finished a piece and then find myself starting again with a certain amount of the wood because it does n't look right			2
i focus hard on the details of faces and muscles			0
" his first use of driftwood , though , had nothing to do with animals or sculpture -- he had initially crafted and sold furniture from it until the possibilities of creating large - scale art suddenly struck him			1
and what ambitious scale it is : each horse sculpture can weigh anything up to a ton ( 1,000 kilograms ) , is 16 - 17 hands ( around 5ft 11ins ) tall and can easily take the weight of a " jockey " or two			0
each takes three to four months to create , with @entity13 and his team of six craftsmen working together on the process , with each sculpture springing to life from a series of initial sketches and scale models			1
" i 'll have an idea -- an image of a horse race or a polo match -- and sketch it until i get something that has motion and movement , " he said			0
" the metal skeleton is crucial			1
if you stripped away the wood , what you would see would look sort of like the skeleton of the actual animal			2
it provides all the strength , but cladding it takes a long time			0
" it may take a long time , but @entity13 says he 's never fully satisfied with the results , and only the world of deadlines prevents him from perpetual tinkering			2
" if it was n't for them , i 'd never leave the studio , " he admitted			0
" if something is even an inch out , you have to redo it			0
there 's never been one i 've been happy with first time			0
