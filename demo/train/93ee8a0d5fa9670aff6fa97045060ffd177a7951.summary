-- a @entity2 grand jury this week found that two deputies in @entity4 should not be criminally charged in the wounding of an unarmed man , who was shot at 15 times while he was in his own driveway			1
@entity9 , 60 , was hit by two of those rounds in his legs			1
a metal rod had to be placed inside his left leg , which was shattered			0
he spoke to @entity0 exclusively in august			0
" how do i feel about what happened ? how would anybody feel getting shot ? " @entity9 asked			1
@entity9 's attorney , @entity19 , told @entity0 on wednesday that his client was distraught over the grand jury decision			1
" this will not preclude mr. @entity9 from moving forward with a civil action , " he said			1
the officers were in fear for their own safety , the sheriff said in an interview after the incident			1
the story began early july 27 when @entity9 was returning to his @entity4 neighborhood			1
searching for a cigarette while inside his white @entity33 , he appeared to have been mistaken for a car thief by a concerned neighbor who called 911			0
@entity37 sheriff 's deputy @entity36 and sgt. @entity38 responded to the call			1
" he came out of the car with more of a lunging motion coming out of the car , and the deputies were standing behind him and he had what appeared to be a metallic object in his hand , " said sheriff @entity40			2
" the tragedy of this is the noncompliance to the directions of law enforcement officers , " @entity40 said in august			2
" had that occurred , we would n't be having this discussion			0
it 's a tragedy all the way around			2
he is both a suspect and a victim			0
" according to the investigative report , @entity9 had his keys and a small flashlight in his hand			2
@entity36 testified that he thought a gun was being pointed at him			0
he fired 12 shots and @entity38 fired three times			0
the case was turned over to the @entity67 ( @entity67 )			0
it provided a report to the @entity37 state attorney , which took the case to the grand jury			1
in the @entity67 report , @entity9 allegedly told investigators that he used crack cocaine and alcohol the day before , but only drank two beers earlier on the day of the shooting			2
but , the investigative report also states , " toxicology records reflected the presence of cocaine and amphetamines in a urine sample taken from @entity9 upon being admitted to the emergency room			2
" @entity9 's attorney says the drugs allegedly in his client 's system do not matter			1
" i do n't think it had any effect whatsoever			0
how did they make an observation that he was committing a crime ? how could he present harm to a law enforcement officer ? he was found by his car , with blood on the seat , " said @entity19			0
@entity9 was among those testifying before the grand jury			1
last month , district attorney @entity104 told @entity0 , " this ( case ) is a little different than a typical case where a prosecutor seeks an indictment			0
" " in this community , in order for the general public to have confidence in the criminal justice system , it 's more appropriate for a cross-section of our community to review the case , " @entity104 said			2
" it would be more appropriate for the grand jury to decide			1
the grand jury recommended more intensive training for the first four years of an officer 's career , and that this case be re-created for training purposes			1
@entity40 , in a statement released wednesday , said his office will begin an internal investigation to determine whether there were any policy violations in the shooting			0
" the outcome of this internal investigation will be based on facts and law , just as the process has been to this point			0
the deputies involved are assigned to administrative duties pending the outcome of the internal investigation , " he said in a press release			0
but @entity19 believes the grand jury 's message to the sheriff bolsters his client 's case			1
" they have to improve their training programs , " he told @entity0			0
" it sends a strong signal to the sheriff 's department that they are negligent in the training of their officers in the use of deadly force			1
" @entity2 police run over man , killing him			0
