next time you ride your fixed - gear bicycle to the the thrift store , where you find a vintage , grease - stained mechanic 's shirt that matches your @entity6 mustache and @entity9 beard , there 's an edgy , if technologically sub-optimal , way to tell your friends about it			1
in an age of the @entity18 and massive @entity20 phablets , flip phones are inexplicably making a comeback			1
no less an arbiter of cool than @entity26 magazine editor @entity25 has apparently dumped her @entity18 in favor of a flipper			1
@entity30 quarterback @entity29 , actress @entity31 and even @entity32 are just a few of the celebrities spotted proudly brandishing the famous piece of paleo - technology			1
and , believe it or not , " dumb phones " are n't exactly the elusive unicorn that some of us think they are			1
as of january , 56 % of @entity42 adults owned smartphones , compared to a total of 90 % who had a cellphone of some kind , according to the @entity48			2
among millennials age 18 - 29 , an overwhelming 83 % of those who owned cellphones had a smartphone , but that leaves the other 17 % who keep their mobile life more basic			2
the hinged , snap - shut " flipper " form factor was originally introduced to the public in 1982 by laptop manufacturer @entity58 with its @entity61 computer			0
@entity62 , perhaps the king of flip phones with its razr line , introduced the clamshell style in 1996 with its startac phone ( which , appropriately enough , was re-released for nostalgic techies in 2010 )			1
is this really all about going for retro , hipster street cred ? there is , at times , a mystifying aspect of " cool " that centers around eschewing modern convenience for vintage ... well ... inconvenience			0
writing on typewriters ? check			0
racing high - wheel bicycles from the 1880s ? yes			0
playing baseball with the rules and equipment of the 1860s ? absolutely			0
but there are obviously some more practical reasons some people , including millennials , go flip			2
for some , it 's about simplifying and uncluttering in a 24/7 plugged - in society			1
" it just seemed like it would be better for my addled brain than a smartphone , " 26 - year - old @entity92 , a tutor and writer , told @entity94			0
" personally i 'm too scattered and unfocused to handle email and @entity98 on my phone			0
" @entity92 swapped out her @entity100 for her mom 's retired flip phone , a pink @entity101			1
no one has to worry about the @entity104 being hacked when they use a flip phone			2
there 's little to no eye and neck strain			2
no fear of @entity111 addiction			0
and , let 's be honest ... there 's something satisfying about a switchblade - like phone flip after an annoying phone conversation that even the most emphatic tap of a touchscreen will never approach			1
maybe the hipsters are onto something after all			0
though we 'll still pass on the bushy beards .			0
