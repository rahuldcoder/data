@entity0 -- the @entity3 has contacted authorities in @entity5 to seek the extradition of @entity7 , the man who admitted leaking top - secret details about @entity3 surveillance programs , a senior @entity3 administration official said saturday			1
federal prosecutors charged @entity7 with espionage and theft of government property , according to a criminal complaint unsealed in @entity15 in @entity16 on friday			2
the @entity3 based the extradition request on the criminal complaint and a treaty between the @entity3 and @entity5 that covers the surrender of " fugitive offenders " and their extradition			1
@entity0 already asked @entity5 , where @entity7 is believed to be in hiding , to detain the former @entity25 contract analyst on a provisional arrest warrant , the @entity27 reported , citing unnamed @entity3 officials			1
" if @entity5 does n't act soon , it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about @entity5 's commitment to the rule of law , " the administration official said			2
the complaint charges @entity7 with theft of government property , unauthorized communication of national defense information , and willful communication of classified communications intelligence to an unauthorized person			1
the latter two allegations amount to espionage under the federal @entity45			0
@entity7 , 30 , has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leaking of classified documents about the @entity25 's surveillance programs			2
those leaks were the basis of reports in @entity56 's @entity55 newspaper and the @entity27 this month			0
the @entity55 revealed @entity7 's identify at his request			1
the documents revealed the existence of top - secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the @entity3 and monitor the internet activity of overseas residents			2
there is a question about whether the espionage charges will be considered political offenses			0
the @entity3 agreement with @entity5 makes an exception for political offenses , in which case the treaty would not apply to @entity7			1
@entity5 executive council member @entity77 said authorities can arrest @entity7 if his actions qualify as a crime under @entity5 law , @entity76 's state - run @entity75 news agency reported early sunday			1
but if his actions are deemed to be political charges , she told @entity75 , then @entity7 will not be extradited			2
" we will work under the framework of @entity5 law , and wo n't allow any illegal or unfair judgment , " @entity5 secretary of justice @entity83 told @entity75			2
prominent @entity3 lawyer @entity87 , a professor at @entity88 , said the espionage charge complicates the case			2
" i think it 's a dumb decision by the @entity92 to charge him with espionage , " @entity87 told @entity1			0
" that 's a political crime under the extradition we have with @entity5			1
it gives @entity5 an excuse to say we do n't have to extradite him			0
" they should have indicted him only for theft and conversion of property			0
then @entity5 would have to comply with the extradition treaty and turn him over			2
" the revelation of the leaks rocked the @entity110 administration and @entity3 intelligence community , raising questions about secret operations of the @entity25 and whether the agency was infringing on @entity3 civil liberties			0
@entity110 , top legislators and national security officials defend the surveillance programs as necessary to combat terrorism and argue that some privacy must be sacrificed in a balanced approach			0
they say the law allows collection of metadata , such as the time and numbers of phone calls , and that a special federal court must approve accessing the content -- listening to the call itself			0
in interviews earlier this month , @entity7 said he fled with the classified documents after taking a leave of absence from his job as an intelligence analyst for @entity25 contractor @entity139			0
the company has since fired him			0
a series of blog posts this week purportedly by @entity7 said he leaked classified details about @entity3 surveillance programs because president @entity110 worsened " abusive " practices , instead of curtailing them as he promised as a candidate			1
however , @entity110 " closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law , deepened and expanded several abusive programs , and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in @entity157 , where men still sit without charge , " a blog post said			0
the @entity55 newspaper and website identified the author as @entity7			0
@entity7 said that he had to get out of the @entity3 before the leaks were published by the @entity55 and the @entity27 to avoid being targeted by the government			1
in an interview with the @entity166 , he said he plans to stay in @entity5 to fight any attempt to force him to return to the @entity3 because he has " faith in @entity5 's rule of law			1
" the @entity3 signed the extradition treaty with @entity5 in 1996 , seven months before the @entity56 colony was handed back to @entity76			1
@entity5 's extradition laws had previously been governed by the @entity3 - @entity56 extradition treaty			1
this new treaty established an agreement under what is known as " one country , two systems " : @entity5 has autonomy from @entity180 in all matters apart from defense and foreign policy			0
@entity7 told the @entity166 , in an interview published sunday , that the @entity3 government is hacking @entity76 mobile phone companies to steal millions of text messages			1
the @entity55 also reported @entity7 's latest claims			1
last week , @entity7 told the @entity27 that @entity3 intelligence agents have been hacking computer networks around the world , including in @entity76 , for years			1
@entity192 reported and wrote from @entity193 ; @entity194 reported from @entity0			0
@entity1 's @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , and @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
