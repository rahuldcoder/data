-- beneath @entity2 's stunning three - state sweep on tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo : @entity7 turnout is down			1
i 'm talking embarrassingly , disturbingly , hey - do n't - you - know - it 's - an - election - year bad			1
it is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file , and a particularly bad omen for @entity17 and the @entity7 in the general election			1
here 's the tale of the tape , state by state , beginning with tuesday night : @entity22 had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and @entity17 came in first , not a distant third as he did tuesday night			1
in @entity26 , more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000			0
and @entity28 -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out , less than half the number who did four years ago			0
even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the @entity7 field , turnout in this election cycle essentially flat - lined			1
in @entity40 , a little more than 121,000 people voted , compared with nearly 119,000 four years before , when action in the @entity43 caucuses absorbed most of the attention			0
in @entity46 , the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012 , compared with 241,000 four years before , despite @entity7 being the only game in town and independents making up 47 % of the total turnout in 2012 , according to @entity0 exit polls			1
take out the independent voters and you 've got a deep net decline			0
always proudly rebellious , @entity56 has been the great outlier in this election cycle			0
with @entity60 making an all - out push for conservatives in a conservative state , turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before			2
but in @entity65 , the decline became unmistakable			2
maybe it decreased because the @entity17 and @entity68 campaigns , plus super @entity69 , spent more than $ 18 million in the @entity65 on tv ads , of which 93 % were negative in the last week alone , according to the @entity72			1
after all , negative ads depress turnout			1
but after all the mud was thrown , 1.6 million people turned out in the nation 's fourth largest state , which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008			0
@entity81 was even worse , with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered @entity7			1
four years before , more than 44,300 participated in the caucus			0
turnout was down more than 25 % despite the @entity7 caucuses being the only game in town			1
party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000			0
all this should be a wake - up call for the @entity7			1
despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date , the response has been a notable yawn among the @entity7 rank and file			1
the turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered @entity7 in each state that has voted to date			1
the caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state 's @entity7			2
for all the grass - roots romanticism , there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee			0
but the news is worst for @entity17 , long the presumptive front - runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line			1
" @entity120 " could be a bumper sticker , even for his supporters			0
the former @entity122 governor has found it difficult to climb above 35 % in national polls , meaning that a majority of @entity7 still support someone else in a notably weak field			2
his vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before , when he lost the nomination to @entity132 in a crowded and comparatively competent field , although @entity22 is the first state he won in ' 08 and lost in 2012			0
you reap what you sow , and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization			2
the @entity7 is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history			2
therefore , it put up more purely right - wing candidates than it did four years before , when center - right leaders such as @entity132 and @entity145 were also in the race			2
a bigger tent inspired bigger turnout			0
but the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates			2
@entity7 seem united in their anger against the president -- like the @entity43 in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options			2
draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from @entity156 to @entity157 to @entity158 and even @entity159 have started and failed			0
some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates , including @entity164 and @entity165 , than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election			0
divided and dispirited is an odd place for the @entity7 to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party - driven election			1
the bottom line is that voter turnout matters			0
and what should be most troubling for @entity7 is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election			1
it is a double barrel of bad news for the @entity7			1
the numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long , but the fact remains -- voters just are n't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012			0

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity197 : rank - and - file votes lower than in the past , a bad omen for @entity17 and @entity7
@entity7 turnout flat - lined in some states , @entity197 says , and went *downhill* in @entity65 , @entity81
@entity197 points to polarization , the effect of negative ads and dissatisfaction with candidates
more bad news , he says : no candidate is likely to appeal to independents , centrists
