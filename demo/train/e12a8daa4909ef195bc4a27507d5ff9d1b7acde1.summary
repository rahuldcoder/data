-- if this weekend 's box office is any indication , the couch jumping stigma that has plagued @entity5 's career for the better part of the last decade may finally be thing of the past			1
@entity5 's latest , the $ 120 million sci - fi adventure @entity10 , opened to a solid $ 38.2 million this weekend			1
that 's a terrific start for the chiseled star , who has struggled recently at the box office with under - performers like @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity18			2
in fact , only four @entity5 vehicles have ever opened higher â € ” and three of them are @entity24 movies			2
( the other is @entity26 )			0
@entity10 actually marks the first number one opening for @entity5 in seven years , though it should be noted that @entity24 : impossible -- ghost protocol opened in limited release and climbed to number one upon its wide expansion			1
@entity5 is n't the only star in @entity10 â € ” it also features @entity35 , @entity36 , and @entity37 â € ” but it was marketed almost exclusively on his appeal			1
according to distributor @entity41 , audiences , which were 57 percent male and 74 percent 25 or older , listed @entity5 as their primary reason for seeing the film , followed by the sci - fi genre and @entity35			1
those same audiences were n't in love with what they saw , though , as @entity10 was issued a lackluster " b - " cinemascore grade			2
@entity0 : ' @entity10 ' movie review domestically , @entity10 opened in 3,783 theaters and earned a fantastic $ 10,085 location average			2
@entity53 screens accounted for $ 5.5 million of @entity10 's weekend gross			1
internationally , the film had a successful weekend , as well			0
after its $ 61.1 million opening from 52 territories , @entity10 took in another $ 33.6 million from 60 territories this time around			1
the film has grossed $ 112 million so far ( for a $ 150.2 million worldwide total ) , and it has high - profile openings in @entity63 and @entity64 still to come			2
in second , the @entity66 drama 42 fell only 34 percent to $ 18 million for a $ 54.1 million total after ten days			1
@entity70 ' $ 40 million baseball pic , which earned an " a + " cinemascore grade , did n't hold quite as well as the help , another " @entity71 " racially charged drama , which dipped 23 percent in its second weekend			2
thus , while 42 still seems likely to hit the $ 100 million mark , it does n't seem destined for a gross in the same range as the help 's $ 169 million total			1
still , 42 is a big winner for @entity70 , which was in dire need of a box office hit			0
@entity0 : ' @entity84 ' review the @entity85 spent the weekend in third place , dropping 28 percent to $ 9.5 million			1
after five weeks , the $ 135 million animation has grossed $ 154.9 million , a great start in the five - year distribution deal between @entity90 and @entity91			2
in fourth , @entity92 did n't hold nearly as well			0
the $ 20 million spoof from @entity96 's dimension fell 56 percent to $ 6.3 million , giving it a weak $ 22.9 million total after ten days			1
at the same point in its run , @entity98 had earned $ 67.5 million			0
@entity101 : @entity102 rounded out the @entity103 with $ 5.8 million , marking a 48 percent drop from its prior frame			1
@entity107 's $ 130 million film has now earned $ 111.2 million domestically , a substantially lower gross than its predecessor , but it 's been making up ground overseas , where the film has earned $ 211.7 million			1
@entity102 opened in @entity64 this week , where it took in $ 33 million during its first seven days			0
worldwide , @entity102 has earned $ 322.9 million and should pass the $ 400 million mark with ease			0
@entity10 -- $ 38.2 million 2			1
42 -- $ 18 million 3			2
the @entity85 -- $ 9.5 million 4			0
@entity92 -- $ 6.3 million 5			0
@entity101 : retaliation -- $ 5.8 million the @entity84 just missed the @entity103 5 after expanding from 514 theaters into 1,542 theaters			1
pines grossed $ 4.8 million , yielding a mediocre $ 3,078 per theater average , which does n't merit further expansion			0
the @entity121 release cost $ 15 million and has earned $ 11.4 million total			0
two other quick highlights : @entity127 's $ 13 million @entity126 thriller @entity124 passed the $ 50 million mark this weekend			1
it 's been a nice mid-level hit for distributor tristar			0
@entity132 has also been doing terrific business for its distributor , @entity134			0
after five weekends , the @entity136 thriller has quietly earned $ 88.8 million			0
