-- @entity1 is asking pilots who fly its 737 jets to pay careful attention to flight instruments after @entity7 investigators said a faulty altimeter contributed to the recent crash of a 737 in the @entity7			1
@entity10 broke into three pieces near @entity12 on february 25			0
the 737 is the most widely flown jet in commercial aviation			0
more than 6,000 have been sold , according to @entity1			0
" @entity1 reminds all operators to make sure flight crews pay close attention to all primary flight controls during critical stages of a flight , " @entity1 spokesman @entity15 told @entity0 on thursday			1
on february 25 , @entity10 from @entity22 to @entity12 dropped from the sky on approach to the landing strip at @entity12 , breaking into three pieces in a muddy field			0
nine people died and 80 people were hurt in the accident			0
in a memo to pilots , @entity1 says there was a malfunction in one of the plane 's two altimeters , which measure the altitude above the terrain where the plane is going to land			1
the left altimeter was giving " erroneous " information , indicating that the plane was below 7 or 8 feet from ground level when it was actually about 2,000 feet in the air , the memo said			2
that caused the automatic throttles to slow the plane down			1
" @entity1 recommends operators inform flight crews of the above investigation details and the ( @entity55 ) interim report when it is released			2
in addition , crews should be reminded to carefully monitor primary flight instruments , " the memo said			1
the plane was on automatic pilot when it crashed , said @entity62 , head of the @entity55			0
the weather was misty at the time of the crash , possibly keeping the pilots from noticing their altitude , @entity63 said			2
automatic pilot should not be used for landings if altimeters are malfunctioning , he said			0
@entity7 investigators said there had been faulty meter readings on two other flights of the same jet , but the pilots were able to land			1
in the @entity12 crash , the pilots did not recognize the altimeter problem until it was too late , @entity63 said			2
the @entity1 memo notes that " the autothrottle , which uses the left radio altimeter data , transitioned to landing flare mode and retarded the throttles to the idle stop			1
the throttles remained at the idle stop for approximately 100 seconds during which time the airspeed decreased to approximately 40 knots below the selected approach speed			0
" @entity15 said he did not know what that speed was for that particular 737 model			0
the warning issued by @entity1 was for many other models of 737 jets , not just the 737 - 800 involved in the @entity12 crash .			1

@entity1 urges 737 pilots to pay careful attention to flight instruments
@entity7 investigators said a faulty altimeter contributed to @entity7 crash
erroneous altitude data caused automatic throttles to slow the plane down
