@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 has rejected review of a closely watched religious liberty appeal over a business owner 's right to deny services to gays and lesbians			1
without comment monday , justices denied the petition of a @entity15 photographer who was sanctioned under state law for refusing to document a lesbian couple 's commitment ceremony			1
the court 's refusal to intervene means those financial penalties stand			1
the case would have given the high court an opportunity to debate a pair of hot - button social issues : faith in the marketplace and same - sex marriage			1
the court has been tackling separate appeals on both fronts			0
at issue here was how to classify the owner 's refusal to offer her services -- as constitutionally protected speech or " commercial conduct " subject to government regulation			2
@entity42 and @entity43 are co-owners of @entity45 in @entity46			0
they were asked in 2006 to capture on film the commitment ceremony of @entity49 and @entity50			1
@entity15 at the time did not allow same - sex marriage but now is one of 17 states that have legalized it			1
@entity56 refused the e-mailed request , explaining later that her work is blended with her beliefs , where the artist and potential client must both feel comfortable collaborating to create a special lifetime memory			0
@entity15 high court rules same - sex couples have right to marry she and her husband concluded they could not " in good conscience " do so , since they would be compelled to convey and " celebrate " someone else 's contrary views			1
" the message a same - sex commitment ceremony communicates is not one i believe , " she said			1
@entity49 and @entity50 found another photographer to shoot the ceremony in @entity76 but later filed a complaint with the state 's @entity78			1
@entity15 's " public accommodations " law forbids businesses from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation , among other things			0
the commission ruled against the @entity87 and fined them $ 6,637.94 in attorney fees			0
the @entity15 @entity2 unanimously agreed , concluding that this was a " neutral law of general applicability " and that the " @entity92 does not exempt creative or expressive businesses from anti-discrimination laws			2
" @entity45 had raised only a compelled speech claim , but the religious liberty aspects formed a key part of the owners ' appeal to the justices			2
" the @entity87 will not create images that tell stories or convey messages contrary to their religious beliefs , " their lawyers said in a legal brief			0
the @entity3 @entity2 's denial of this appeal comes a month after @entity109 's governor vetoed @entity110 , a @entity111 - led measure that would have allowed businesses to deny services to gay and lesbian customers , as long as the owners asserted their faith - based beliefs			1
supporters said the measure promoted religious freedom , but opponents said it discriminated against gays and lesbians			2
the state 's @entity111 @entity3 senators and a bipartisan coalition of business and advocacy groups urged that it be repealed			2
at least a dozen other states are considering similar legislation , including @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity135 and @entity138			0
@entity109 's anti-gay bill veto unlikely to end ' religious freedom ' movement an important aspect of the @entity15 case was whether artistic or communication - driven businesses should be exempt from the law , when as the @entity87 argued , " compelled speech " might be the result			1
lawyers for the photographers told the high court in their legal brief that " ms. @entity56 , and not her customer , is the speaker communicating through her photographs and books			0
... they believe that if they were to communicate a contrary message about marriage -- by , for example , telling the story of a polygamous wedding ceremony -- they would be disobeying @entity164			2
" the had earlier pointed to @entity15 's @entity165 , which says the state may not unduly burden a person 's free exercise of religion			0
it is one of 18 similar state measures around the @entity3 a similar federal law was passed in 1993 , and the high court is deciding whether it applies to for - profit businesses that refuse to provide certain contraception health coverage to their employees under @entity180			2
some companies say those health care mandates violate their religious convictions			0
the @entity87 ' supporters also pointed to past @entity3 @entity2 cases , including one allowing privately groups in @entity187 to keep gay and lesbian activists from marching in the annual @entity190 on city streets			2
but @entity49 's attorneys framed the issue in stark terms			1
" the law simply says : whatever service you provide , you must not discriminate against customers when you engage in public commerce , " they said in their legal brief			0
" moreover , when the company sells its goods and services to the general public , it is not a private actor engaged in the expression of its own message			0
customers do not pay for the privilege of facilitating the company 's message			0
" and they highlighted a body of high court precedent supporting their views , including a 2006 decision saying colleges must allow military recruiters on campus or risk the loss of federal funds , even if the schools disagreed with the @entity226 's policy at the time banning gays and lesbians from openly serving in the armed forces			1
@entity49 argued that by offering client services to the general public , the photography business could not then pick and choose based on sexual orientation			1
such discrimination protection , her lawyers said , would also apply if @entity56 refused to sell her artistic creations in a gallery to gay and lesbian patrons			0
other courts have agreed on the broader questions			0
a @entity242 judge last year ruled against a suburban @entity244 baker who refused to custom - create a cake for a gay couple 's wedding reception			1
that administrative law judge said the business owner had " no free speech right to refuse because they were only asked to bake a cake , not make a speech			0
" the @entity15 case is @entity255 v. @entity49 ( 13 - 585 ) .			1

@entity2 wo *n't* review appeal of case about a business 's right to deny services to gays , lesbians
justices would have debated issues of faith in the marketplace and same - sex marriage
business refused to photograph ceremony of @entity49 and @entity50
the court 's denial of this appeal comes a month after @entity109 's governor vetoed @entity110
