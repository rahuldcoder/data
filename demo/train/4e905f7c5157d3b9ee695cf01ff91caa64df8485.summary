-- @entity1 is giving users the bird			1
a cute , little , upwardly mobile bird			0
the social - networking company wants to be universally known by a new streamlined bird logo , replacing the scruffier bird that had symbolized @entity1 since ... well , way back in 2010			1
" starting today you 'll begin to notice a simplified @entity1 bird , " @entity1 said in a blog post wednesday			1
" from now on , this bird will be the universally recognizable symbol of @entity1			1
( @entity1 is the bird , the bird is @entity1			1
) there 's no longer a need for text , bubbled typefaces , or a lowercase " t " to represent @entity1			2
" @entity1 gave no reason for the refreshed bird , which is less chubby , has fewer feathers and is angled more towards the sky than its predecessor			1
but jokesters in the @entity26 , where # twitterbird was trending wednesday , were only too happy to offer some			0
" about time we get a simplified # twitterbird that last one was so not 140 characters ! " wrote @entity28			0
" @entity1 is too young to be changing its logo			2
although , now the bird is soaring , " added @entity32			0
" the new # twitterbird is the situation of social media icons			0
he 's all " gym , @entity1 , laundry			2
what , @entity38 ? ! want some ? ! " said @entity39			0
last year 's short - lived @entity1 darling , the @entity42 's @entity41 , offered this : " @entity1 changed its little blue bird logo ! he still looks delicious ... nice , i mean nice			1
" and @entity47 may have spoken for many users when he tweeted , " maybe @ twitter should spend more time working on performance instead of playing with their logo			0
" in its post , @entity1 says the new bird is " crafted purely from three sets of overlapping circles â € ” similar to how your networks , interests and ideas connect and intersect with peers and friends			2
" in rather flowery rhetoric , the post goes on to say , " whether soaring high above the @entity70 to take in a broad view , or flocking with other birds to achieve a common purpose , a bird in flight is the ultimate representation of freedom , hope and limitless possibility			0
" the company on wednesday was urging developers to switch to the new logo -- although the @entity1 icon in @entity79 's @entity78 was still showing the old bird .			1

twitter on wednesday *updated* its little blue bird logo
the change *prompted* a *flurry* of jokes ... on @entity1 , of course
