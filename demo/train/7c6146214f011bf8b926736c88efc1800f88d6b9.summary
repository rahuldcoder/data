when @entity1 was born , nurses could n't rotate his head from side to side			1
doing so made him turn blue instantly			0
" i will never forget seeing him for the first time like that , " his mom , @entity6 , said in a @entity8 video posted by @entity10 's @entity9			1
" @entity1 was born with tetralogy of @entity16 with absent pulmonary valve -- a fancy way of saying he had a hole between the lower chambers of his heart , which put extreme pressure on his lungs			1
the pressure caused his airways to collapse ; in essence , he was trying to breathe through tiny slits			2
this condition is called severe tracheobronchomalacia			1
" in some ways the heart defect is relatively straightforward to fix , " dr. @entity30 , head of pediatric cardiovascular surgery at @entity9 , said in the video			0
" it 's the lung issues and the airway issues that are the bigger problem			0
" the @entity39 spent months watching their son turn blue four or five times a day as hospital staff struggled to revive him , according to a university press release			1
@entity1 was put on a ventilator and heavy medication to prevent him from fighting the breathing tube			1
then in may 2013 , @entity1 's father , @entity47 , read an article about another baby with a similar breathing problem			1
@entity51 had a rare obstruction in his lungs called bronchial malacia			0
using an experimental technique never before tried on a human , @entity1 read , doctors created a splint made out of biological material that effectively carved a path through @entity51 's blocked airway			1
the splint was created on a three - dimensional printer			2
" it 's magical to me , " dr. @entity64 , an associate professor of pediatric otolaryngology at the @entity10 , told @entity65 at the time			2
@entity64 implanted the splint in @entity68			0
" we 're talking about taking dust and using it to build body parts			0
" @entity51 is now 2 years old and free of symptoms related to his bronchial malacia			0
read more about @entity51 's story the @entity39 decided to reach out to see if @entity64 would be interested in helping @entity1			1
devices created with 3 - d printers have not yet been approved by the @entity77 for use in humans			0
@entity64 and his colleague , biomedical engineer @entity80 , had gotten emergency clearance from the @entity77 to try the treatment on @entity51			0
but by december , @entity1 was in critical condition			2
his parents took him to the @entity86 hospital , and @entity64 obtained another emergency clearance from the @entity77			0
after doing a ct scan of @entity1 's trachea and bronchi , @entity80 used a 3 - d printer to create a splint out of a biopolymer called polycaprolactone			1
on january 31 , @entity30 sewed the splint around @entity1 's right and left bronchi to expand his airway			1
the doctors say the splint will be absorbed by @entity1 's body during the next three years as his airways grow stronger			1
in the meantime , @entity1 is breathing easier and needs less help from the ventilator			1
" it is a tremendous feeling to know that this device has saved another child , " @entity80 said in the press release			2
" we believe there are many other applications for these techniques , but to see the impact living and breathing in front of you is overwhelming			0
" " @entity118 tracheobronchomalacia has been a condition that has frustrated me for years , " added @entity64			0
" i 've seen children die from it			0
to see this device work , for a second time , it 's a major accomplishment and offers hope for these children			2
" @entity64 and @entity80 will be participating in a @entity127 " @entity127 " tuesday at noon et. three weeks after the surgery , @entity1 was smiling at his parents " we have n't seen smiles for awhile , so getting smiles is very exciting , " @entity6 said in the video			2
doctors believe @entity1 will be able to come off the ventilator fully within a matter of months			1
the couple plan to take their 18 - month - old boy home for the first time then			0
@entity142 printed hearts and lungs : the shape of medicine to come			0

*toddler* with severe tracheobronchomalacia saved by @entity151 printed device
doctors at @entity10 created a splint out of a biopolymer
the splint is helping @entity1 breathe easier with less assistance from ventilator
the @entity39 hope to take their son home soon
