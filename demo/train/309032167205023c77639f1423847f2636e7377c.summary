@entity0 -- outside @entity2 , ask a graduate student in line to see the @entity5 what he thinks of gerrymandering , and you might get this answer : " i think @entity10 is a great guy			1
" no , he is n't			2
gerrymandering is the term for the way politicians draw boundary lines for legislative districts in a way designed to keep one party or the other in power in that particular district			1
in the last 10 years , 78 % of the seats in the @entity26 @entity25 -- almost four out of every five members of @entity23 -- did not change party hands even once			1
in @entity31 , with 53 seats -- the most in the nation -- incumbents were kept so safe that only one of those seats changed party control in the past decade			1
@entity36 , redistricting expert for the nonpartisan @entity38 , says only 20 races for @entity23 are expected to be tossups in the 2012 election			1
that 's only 20 out of the 435 seats in the @entity25			1
" in general elections , it 's almost rigged , " he said			1
more on the history behind gerrymandering the lines are redrawn for seats in @entity23 each 10 years after the @entity26 @entity52 measures population shifts			1
that process is going on now in states across the country			2
among @entity1 's findings : the @entity58 race has been used to create a political divide in the @entity58			1
in the five @entity62 states -- @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 -- only nine @entity68 are left in @entity23			1
he is @entity64 democrat @entity70 , and @entity72 control in that state 's legislature has led to his home city of @entity76 being excluded from his current district			2
in 2010 , @entity72 captured control of @entity80 's legislature for the first time since shortly after the @entity82			2
they drew district lines in a way to pack 49 % of all of @entity80 's @entity86 voters in just three of the state 's 13 congressional districts			1
that left the other 10 districts mostly white and predictably @entity72			0
democrats in @entity80 accuse the @entity72 of political " resegregation			1
" a court battle is looming			0
@entity94 after the @entity72 landslide in 2010 , this is the only battleground state winning or losing a seat where @entity68 remain in control			0
they pushed through their new map over the @entity103 holiday weekend			0
most of the five freshmen @entity72 elected to @entity23 last time will face difficult races to return for a second term			1
nowhere is gerrymandering more apparent than in @entity110 's @entity109 , where a grassy strip hardly a football field wide , stuck in between two expressways , connects the top and bottom halves of a district designed to keep a @entity117 in @entity23			1
according to the 4th district rep. @entity118 , a @entity70 , @entity110 has an @entity120 district , a @entity122 district , a @entity124 district and three black districts			0
look at a map and all have irregular , unusual lines			0
this is not a matter of party control			1
all the incumbents are @entity68			0
the lines preserve racial and ethnic heritages			0
in @entity94 , it is the @entity72 that is suing @entity68 to try to overturn the new map			0
in 2010 , they passed an amendment to the state constitution to take redistricting out of political hands and have a citizens commission redraw the lines			1
it was forbidden to favor incumbents			1
as a result , more than half of @entity31 's 53 representatives were placed in the same district with another colleague for the 2012 election			0
as many as 15 could lose or else face retirement to avoid losing			0
" fifteen out of 53 does not sound like a lot , " @entity153 said			0
" but compared to most other states , that 's an avalanche			0
" party politics did give way to social politics			2
@entity160 , who accounted for most of @entity31 's population growth , could win as many as nine seats next year			2
the @entity86 - @entity86 population shrank , but under pressure , the citizens commission retained the three traditionally black seats in south @entity167			2
@entity168 voter reform met resistance here			0
three million people voted to pass amendments last year that say the legislature can not not favor or penalize incumbents or political parties when it redraws the lines			1
two members of @entity23 -- democrat @entity179 , who is @entity86 , and @entity72 @entity180 , who is @entity117 -- filed a lawsuit in federal court to try to overturn what the voters had done			1
@entity168 's @entity25 , using taxpayer money , hired a law firm to support them in opposing the taxpayers ' will			1
their argument : the @entity26 @entity190 has given the legislature the sole responsibility for redistricting			2
a federal judge rejected that argument and threw out the lawsuit			0
but the two incumbents , supported by the legislature , are appealing , and they say the case could go all the way to the @entity26 @entity201			0
@entity202 for three decades now , @entity202 has had a nonpartisan redistricting system			2
two legislative staffers draw the maps in secrecy without political interference			2
" in @entity202 , it is understood incumbent protection is not the name of the game , " one of those staffers said			0
as a result , @entity202 has the nation 's only congressional race next year where a longtime @entity72 incumbent , @entity217 , is paired against a longtime @entity68 incumbent , @entity218			2
past voting patterns indicate they could be separated by no more than 1 % , either way			1
@entity221 like it this way , and that includes @entity217			0
he said , " i think if you sit in a very safe district , a lot of times these people will ignore the public will			0
they wo n't have to listen because they can do whatever they want to , and vote however they want to , and not be held accountable for it			0
" as @entity153 put it , " @entity26 are basically between the ideological 40 - yard lines			0
but the districts are n't			0
and that 's part of the reason @entity23 is so polarized			1

redistricting is " almost rigged " to favor parties in power , expert says
in the past decade , 78 % of @entity25 seats did not change party hands
race has been used to create a political divide in the @entity58
expert blames gerrymandering for polarization of @entity23
