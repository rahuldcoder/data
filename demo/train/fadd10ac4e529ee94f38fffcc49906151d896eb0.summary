the @entity0 sidestepped a sweeping decision on the use of race - conscious school admission policies , ruling monday on the criteria at the @entity6 and whether it violates the equal protection rights of some white applicants			1
the justices threw the case back to the lower courts for further review			0
the court affirmed the use of race in the admissions process , but made it harder for institutions to use such policies to achieve diversity			1
the 7 - 1 decision avoids the larger constitutional issues			1
@entity24 ) @entity25 individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in @entity28 , @entity29			1
she claims it was because she is white and that she was being treated differently than some less - qualified minority students who were accepted			1
in a statement after the ruling @entity25 said , " i am grateful to the justices for moving the nation closer to the day when a student 's race is n't used at all in college admissions			1
" the decision comes as the justices work toward wrapping up a busy term			0
among the big issues yet to be resolved : federal enforcement of the @entity44 and the politically blockbuster constitutionality of same - sex marriage			0
the @entity0 plans to meet again on tuesday to issue additional opinions			1
in the @entity29 case , the school defended its policy of considering race as one of many factors , such as test scores , community service , leadership , and work experience , designed to create a diverse campus			1
university encouraged by decision the university said it was encouraged by the decision			0
" we remain committed to assembling a student body at @entity6 that provides the educational benefits of diversity on campus while respecting the rights of all students and acting within the constitutional framework established by the court , " said school president @entity63			1
the @entity74 administration agreed with the school , saying to grow a nation built on differing complexions and backgrounds will depend on future leaders " who possess the understanding of diversity that is necessary to govern and defend the @entity83			1
" in ruling narrowly , the court reaffirmed earlier decisions allowing for a limited use of race - conscious public policies			1
" the attainment of a diverse student body serves values beyond race alone , including enhanced classroom dialogue and the lessening of racial isolation and stereotypes , " wrote justice @entity89 in the majority opinion			2
ex-student challenges university 's affirmative action policy but @entity89 said that such admissions programs must withstand close review			2
@entity89 said the " university must prove that the means chosen " to attain diversity " are narrowly tailored to that goal , " adding that the highest level of legal standard must be met before institutions use diversity programs			2
" @entity112 ( of the policy ) imposes on the university the ultimate burden of demonstrating , before turning to racial classification , that available , workable race - neutral alternatives do not suffice , " he said			1
the @entity0 in recent decades has established a three - pronged test to balance the government 's interest against a constitutional right or principle , and decide which laws may go too far			1
these standards of review are rational basis scrutiny , heightened scrutiny , and strict scrutiny			0
@entity89 said the appropriate standard was not applied properly by the lower federal courts in the @entity25 case			0
he said state universities must demonstarte to the courts that no workable race - neutral alternatives would produce the desired educational and social benefits			2
justices @entity139 and @entity141 , who are more left - leaning , agreed with the @entity0 's five conservatives			1
justices @entity143 and @entity145 also agreed with the limited reach of the ruling , but separately suggested continuing use of diversity programs in the classroom were unconstitutional			2
" although cloaked in good intentions , the university 's racial tinkering harms the very people it claims to be helping , " said @entity145 , the court 's only @entity151 , who himself benefited from affirmative action programs early in his academic and professional career			0
only justice @entity159 disagreed with the majority 's conclusion lower courts should take another look at the @entity25 case			0
" government actors need not be blind to to the lingering effects of an overtly discriminatory past , " she said			0
" i have said before and reiterate here that only an ostrich could regard the supposedly neutral alternative as race unconscious			0
" justice @entity171 did not participate in the case because she apparently had been briefed on the issue as the @entity74 administration 's solicitor general before joining the high court			0
three questions for @entity145 ideological differences the justices said in 2003 that state universities can , in limited circumstances , tailor their admissions policies to consider an applicant 's race			2
and this court was clearly divided along ideological lines during last october 's oral arguments about whether affirmative action essentially has run its social and legal course , and should no longer be used in the way schools like the @entity29 university has done			0
the state of @entity29 provides for a hybrid admissions policy : automatic acceptance to its university 's main campus in @entity198 for in - state students finishing in the top 10 percent of their high schools , ensuring a measure of non-subjective diversity			1
three - fourths of the in - state student body get in this way			2
@entity25 just missed that opportunity , so had to compete in a separate pool of students seeking to attend the highly competitive school			0
it is that selection process that was before the court			0
the school , with 52,000 students , has touted its " holistic " policy of considering race as one of many factors			1
african - americans in @entity29 as a whole represent about 12 percent of the overall population , but only make up about 5 or 6 percent of @entity6 admissions			1
the high court will get another crack at the issue this fall in a separate appeal			0
the justices will decide the constitutionality of a voter referendum in @entity229 banning race - and sex - based discrimination or preferential treatment in public university admission decisions			2
oral arguments are likely in october			0
the case is @entity236 ( 11 - 345 )			0
fast facts : top @entity83 @entity0 decisions			0

but 7 - 1 ruling makes it harder for institutions to justify diversity in certain cases
@entity0 case involved white student who sued after application was rejected
