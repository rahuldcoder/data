-- seriously , is there anything @entity3 does n't do ? writer , actor , director , singer , producer , voice of beloved animated characters and awards show host			1
the world is about to see if leading man is yet another title @entity16 can add to his already extensive @entity18 resume			1
@entity16 's film " @entity19 " opens this weekend , and it is first time he 's heading up a cast as a real live actor			1
the film spoofs old - fashioned westerns			2
@entity16 plays @entity27 , a sheep farmer who is far from enthused about living in the @entity28			1
of course , it 's not his first movie			2
@entity16 wrote and directed the 2012 film " @entity34 " as well as voiced the foul - mouthed , stuffed bear around which the plot revolves			1
but this is the first time @entity16 himself has stepped into the spotlight , which begs an obvious question			1
" @entity41 ' certify mr. @entity3 as a bona fide movie star , " asks the @entity40 ' @entity39			1
" it 's too soon to tell			2
he demonstrates enough confidence to emerge relatively unscathed from the movie , which he produced , directed and wrote ( with @entity48 and @entity49 ) , but he is far from imperial			0
at the same time , you wonder if someone else ( maybe @entity52 ) could have given @entity27 a stronger personality			0
" @entity16 's career began at a fairly young age			1
he told @entity57 during a @entity0 interview that he began drawing as a toddler			0
" i would watch ' @entity61 ' and @entity62 and whatnot , and i would -- my parents saved sketches that i did that are crude but oddly recognizable , " @entity16 said			1
it was while he was a student at the @entity67 that he began developing what would ultimately become the hit @entity71 animated series " @entity72			0
" he went on to develop more animated shows : " @entity74 ! " and " @entity75			0
" @entity16 told @entity76 in 2012 that he believed " @entity72 " was often unfairly dismissed as " frat boy humor , " though he admitted that there is plenty of that			1
" but we try to include an equal amount of intelligent humor , " he told the magazine			0
" if it makes you laugh , what 's wrong with that ? there 's room for both highbrow and lowbrow			0
" the success of his critically acclaimed 2011 jazz album , " @entity94 " ( it was nominated for two @entity95 ) has led to a deal for a reported forthcoming @entity98 album			0
and he is one of the producers of the rebooted " cosmos : a @entity103 " television series			0
that 's not to say that everything @entity16 has touched has been golden			1
his live - action @entity71 comedy " dads " starring another @entity109 and @entity110 was panned by critics from the onset and was recently canceled			1
and his stint as the host of the 2013 @entity117 telecast left viewers divided			0
his " @entity120 to die in the @entity28 " co-star @entity119 praised his versatility			0
" he 's fantastic , " she said			0
" he wears every single hat which was about 150 that he wore in this move really well like just a seasoned pro. i mean there was nothing about him that said to me he was a first - time actor or a -- i think we were all very impressed by just how effortlessly he did all of it			2
" as for @entity16 , he said he had a very simple reason for stepping in front of the camera			2
" i like a challenge , " he said			2
" i like taking a risk , something i have n't done before			0

@entity3 has a long , *diverse* resume
his first lead live - action role is on " @entity19 "
@entity16 said he enjoyed the challenge
