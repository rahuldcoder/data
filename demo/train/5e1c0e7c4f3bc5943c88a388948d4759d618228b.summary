the right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated			0
this is the beginning of the @entity9 to the @entity10 , and defines one of the most important rights we have against a potentially tyrannical government			2
throughout history , governments have used the confiscation of private property , as well as bullying and surveillance techniques , to keep populations under control and maintain a continuous threat against those who would dare criticize them			0
the explicit enshrinement of the right to be left alone is one of the crucial features that has defined @entity29 as such a unique and moral nation			2
@entity31 to sue @entity33 administration over @entity34 in recent years , however , this right , like so many others , has come under attack by the overzealous powers that be in @entity39 , eager to sacrifice liberty in the name of security , and using fear as a weapon to make us forget the importance of being free			1
in 2013 , the revelation that the @entity34 was collecting and storing the metadata from the phone calls and e-mails of millions of @entity29 citizens -- without any suspicion of criminal activity -- served as a striking wake - up call for the country			1
@entity29 do not like to think of their government as some orwellian leviathan , engaging in surveillance tactics that we only expect to see in oppressive autocracies			2
that such surveillance could be going on in what is ostensibly the freest nation in the world is a chilling thought indeed			0
since 2006 , the @entity34 has been spying on us , treating @entity29 citizens as no more than common criminals , casting suspicion on honest people with not even a whisper of criminal activity about them			1
these are not the actions befitting a country that was once held up as a paragon of freedom and a model for the rest of the world			0
online , live protests target @entity34 surveillance we are told that these intrusive and unconstitutional measures are necessary to protect us from the forces of international terrorism			1
we are told that a surrender of our privacy rights is a small price to pay for the knowledge that we can sleep safe and secure in our beds			0
we are committed to a safe @entity29 , but we do not accept the notion that a surveillance state is necessary to safeguard the lives and liberty of @entity29 citizens			1
these assurances of the necessity to give up a little privacy for the sake of safety are made all the less convincing by the fact that , after more than seven years , the @entity34 has been unable to provide any evidence that the collection of telephone metadata from @entity29 has led to the prevention of even a single terrorist attack			1
there can be no justification for the preservation of a domestic surveillance program that has utterly failed in its stated goals			0
in addition to the @entity34 's privacy violations , the existence of government spying serves as a significant obstacle toward citizens exercising their first amendment rights to free speech			2
we have already seen government agencies like the @entity119 specifically target law - abiding citizens for their political views			0
the willingness of ordinary people to criticize the government will be greatly compromised by being under the constant , watchful eye of the government , and anyone deemed guilty of suspicious activity may consider an audit the least of their worries			0
for all these reasons , we have elected to file a class action suit on behalf of all @entity29 whose rights have been violated by the @entity34 's unconstitutional spying programs			1
we are requesting a ruling confirming that the blanket collection of @entity29 ' telephone metadata without reasonable cause violates the @entity9 of the @entity10 , and requiring that these programs be halted immediately and that all previously collected data be purged from government databases			1
it 's time to hold government officials accountable for their habitual trampling on the @entity10 and on our rights as individuals			2
our case will be an important step down the road of restoring our @entity10 and reining in our own overreaching federal government .			0
