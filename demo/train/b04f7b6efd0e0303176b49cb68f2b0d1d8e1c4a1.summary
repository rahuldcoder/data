-- @entity1 was already an @entity2 - nominated star when director @entity4 's " taken " was released in 2008 , but the movie 's sleeper success made audiences look at the actor differently			1
his portrayal of @entity10 , a former @entity11 operative on the hunt for his daughter 's sex - trafficking kidnappers , became a cult success and made him a full - fledged action star at almost 60			1
as such , " taken 2 " barreled into theaters this weekend , bringing in $ 50 million			2
it 's the first film to make that much in three days since " @entity20 " in july			2
" @entity24 " is not so much a sequel as it is an extension of the first movie			1
the @entity26 brothers of @entity1 's victims demand vengeance			1
" the dead cry out to us for justice , " says @entity29 , the film 's villain played by @entity31			2
this time the director is @entity37 's @entity36 , who reportedly adopted his last name because his birthday falls on august 6 , 1965 , 20 years after the atomic bombing of @entity41 , @entity42			2
it would seem subtlety is n't his forte or his movie 's			2
review : ' taken 2 ' espionage is synonymous with explosions in the " taken " series , along with pretty much every film representation of the @entity11 -- from @entity52 to @entity53			1
" that 's always the intention in @entity57 , " says @entity54			1
" that 's the @entity57 shortcut			2
" a covert @entity11 operative for 16 years , @entity54 knows about what she 's talking			1
" my area of expertise was the @entity63 and counterterrorism , " she says			2
" i did the classic work that @entity66 think spies do overseas			0
" she chronicles her experience , as much as she 's able to , in her book " denial and deception : an insider 's view of the @entity11			1
" the book takes a look at @entity54 's work as well as the @entity76 culture and structural issues with the agency			1
considering @entity54 's blond hair , you think she 'd stick out like a sore thumb in that part of the world			1
" you can certainly blend in if you are of @entity63 ethnicity , but we adopt cover stories that allow us to live , work and move through these societies in ways that look very natural and normal within the context of their engagement with foreigners , " she says			0
sometimes that also included traditional dresses and veils			0
" we know the language , we know the societal norms -- things we can and can not do and what will draw attention to you			0
" @entity1 throws any form of clandestine operations out the window as the @entity26 terrorists take him and his ex-wife , played by @entity108 , into their desolate torture room of chains and pipes			1
after his ex-wife is hung upside down with a bag over her head , @entity112 calls his daughter @entity116 ( who was taken in the first " taken " film )			0
the first plan is for her to make her way to a @entity66 embassy , but she refuses			0
she needs to help her father despite the post-traumatic stress disorder she may be suffering from after her own sex - trafficking experience			0
" you can only train so much for something like that , " @entity54 says of an abduction scenario			1
" we know that when you 're caught by a terrorist , you have a bad outcome in front of you , and you hope for either immediate rescue or a quick death			0
" but operatives know the risk , @entity54 says			1
" if you 're going to be so focused on the risks , you 're not going to be able to do your job			0
" @entity112 ' @entity140 involves his daughter using a shoelace , a sharpie and some hand grenades thrown on the streets of @entity147 , @entity148 , to help pinpoint his location			0
from an audience standpoint , it makes no sense and perfect sense all at once			0
" it 's very hard to be a clandestine operator if every time you walk through the door something blows up , " @entity54 says			1
" that makes a good film , but it does n't make very good operations			0
espionage , by its very nature , is a mind game			1
people do n't wake up and decide to trigger countries in vengeance on a whim			0
" the vengeance in " @entity24 " is in full force as @entity116 and her father seek to sort out the group of @entity26 misfits			1
this includes a wild ride through the streets that is a bit of a ridiculous premise but does allow for some father - daughter bonding time that 's important given the pair 's somewhat rocky relationship			0
@entity112 ' relationship with his ex-wife is also strained because of his former career as a @entity11 operative			1
" it takes a special kind of person to live in a world that we create for ourselves , " @entity54 says			1
" in your personal relationships that are not part of that clandestine world , there is an element of omission and people can feel that			0
" despite the opportunity for leaving out details about her life , @entity54 points out that her whole career was based around figuring out people			2
" i 've been married to my husband for forever , and we figured out a way to make it work			0
" but living undercover means lying to everyone -- including children			0
" here we are trying to ( raise ) upstanding , honest @entity66 , but we 're lying to them from @entity213 , and we 're doing it for the specific reason of protecting national security , " @entity54 says			2
" when you choose that moment to say , ' by the way son , i 've been lying to you all along , ' that 's hard			0
' " box office report : ' taken 2 '			0

@entity1 returns as former @entity11 operative @entity10 in " @entity24 "
@entity54 was a covert operative for 16 years
" espionage , by its very nature , is a mind game , " @entity54 says
