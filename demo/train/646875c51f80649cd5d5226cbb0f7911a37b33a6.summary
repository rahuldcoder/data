-- if you think you saw a flying saucer saturday over @entity3 , you might not be crazy -- except what you saw did n't come from outer space , though that may be its ultimate destination			2
after several weather - related delays this month , @entity9 's new spacecraft lifted off from the @entity13 's @entity12 in @entity14 , @entity3 , on saturday morning			1
the space agency said its @entity16 , or @entity17 , went up at 8:45 a.m. ( 2:45 p.m. et ) , carried aloft by a giant balloon on a mission to test landing technologies for a future human mission to @entity22			1
shortly after 11 a.m. , the test vehicle dropped from the balloon and the " powered flight , " as @entity9 described it , began			1
at this point , the disc - like @entity17 was about 120,000 feet , or more than 20 miles , above @entity29			0
@entity9 said their current information indicates the spacecraft 's rocket fired just as they hoped , with the expectation that it would rise up to about 180,000 feet , reaching the stratosphere			2
eventually , a donut - shaped tube inflated -- which makes the whole thing look like a flying saucer -- thus beginning the deceleration process			0
the next thing that was supposed to slow the vehicle 's descent was a giant parachute , though @entity9 acknowledged it " did not deploy as expected			2
" the whole process ended with the vehicle 's splashdown in the @entity12 about 11:35 a.m. , or 30 minutes after it was released from the balloon			1
" from what we know , the test was successful , " said @entity47 , a @entity9 spokeswoman			1
@entity47 noted that noted @entity9 officials are still going through the data to assess everything what happened , noting that the only flaw known right now was that the parachute the space agency was testing had " an issue			0
" project managers are expected to give a more thorough rundown of how things went on sunday morning			0
current technology for decelerating from high speeds during re-entry into the atmosphere to the final stages of landing on @entity22 dates back to @entity9 's @entity69 , which put two landers on the @entity22 surface in 1976			1
the basic @entity69 parachute design has been used ever since			0
it was successfully used again in 2012 to deliver the rover curiosity to @entity22			0
@entity76 , by the way , just celebrated the anniversary of its first @entity22 year on the @entity22			0
@entity9 will need new and improved landing technologies to handle the larger spaceships of tomorrow and land them on rocky surfaces			0
@entity9 's deep - space craft readying for launch happy anniversary ! on @entity22 , curiosity rover has done a lot in a long year			1

new : @entity9 spokeswoman : the test appears to have been a success
new : the powered flight and descent of the test vehicle took 30 minutes , @entity9 says
@entity9 's newest spacecraft launches into the *skies* over @entity3 on a test flight
*safely* landing a *hurtling* spacecraft is *crucial* for a human mission to @entity22
