-- a federal appeals court on thursday narrowly struck down @entity3 's 6 - year - old ban on considering race and gender in college admissions , a ruling that the state intends to appeal to the @entity10 @entity9			1
the @entity10 6th @entity11 ruled 8 - 7 that the affirmative action ban , which @entity3 voters passed in a 2006 referendum , violated the @entity10 @entity16 's equal protection laws			1
the ruling is the latest step in a years - long legal battle over whether the state 's colleges can use race and gender as a factor in choosing which students to admit			1
the ban 's opponents say the case could help strike down anti-affirmative - action policies in other states if it goes to the @entity9			1
opinion : what 's wrong with affirmative action -- and why we need it " we think this is a tremendous victory for the tens and hundreds of thousands of students who fought for affirmative action for decades , " said @entity3 attorney @entity36 , who represents the @entity38 coalition that sued to overturn the ban			1
" this is a tremendous day for black and @entity46 students in the entire country , " @entity36 said			1
the ruling might take a while to go into effect , if ever			2
the office of @entity3 attorney general @entity52 , who is defending the ban , says the court 's rulings take effect only when it issues a mandate , usually weeks later			1
but @entity52 intends to inform the court that he will appeal to the @entity10 @entity9 , and will ask the appeals court to stay its ruling until the high court can review the case , @entity52 spokeswoman @entity58 said			1
@entity52 plans to file an appeal with the @entity10 @entity9 within 90 days , his office said			2
" ( the ban ) embodies the fundamental premise of what @entity10 is all about : equal opportunity under the law , " @entity52 said in a news release thursday			0
" entrance to our great universities must be based upon merit			0
" a three - judge panel from the same court made a similar ruling on the ban last year , 2 - 1			2
@entity52 then asked the full court to consider the case , leading to thursday 's ruling			0
the ban was passed in a 2006 referendum , with 58 % voting yes			0
it was added to the state 's constitution , barring publicly funded colleges from granting " preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race , sex , color , ethnicity or national origin			0
" 5 things to know about affirmative action that prompted a series of lawsuits and appeals from various groups			0
in thursday 's ruling , judge @entity106 wrote that the ban illegally gives minorities fewer ways to persuade colleges to adopt a " race - conscious admissions policy " than people have to influence colleges on other aspects of admissions			1
" a black student seeking the adoption of a constitutionally permissible race - conscious admissions policy ... could do only one thing to effect change : she could attempt to amend the @entity122 -- a lengthy , expensive and arduous process -- to repeal the consequences " of the ban , @entity106 wrote			1
on the other hand , a student could do several other things to persuade a college to alter its admissions policy to favor applicants ' alumni connections , including lobbying the admissions committee or petitioning the university 's leaders , @entity106 wrote			2
" the existence of such a comparative structural burden undermines the @entity139 's guarantee that all citizens ought to have equal access to the tools of political change , " @entity106 wrote			0
@entity3 voters approved the ban after the @entity10 @entity9 ruled in 2003 that while @entity3 universities could use race as a factor in choosing which students to admit , they could not make race the determining factor in deciding whether applicants are accepted the referendum effort was led by @entity154 , who was at the center of the high court case			1
as a white student , she was put on the waiting list for undergraduate admission to the state 's largest university			0
she eventually attended another school , and became the lead plaintiff in a subsequent reverse discrimination lawsuit			0
after the @entity9 's 2003 decision , she began a public campaign to end racial preferences in admissions			2
affirmative action : good or harmful ? the @entity3 ban also prohibits the state from considering race and gender in public hiring and public contracting decisions			1
but thursday 's ruling deals only with the college admissions portion , @entity58 said			1
efforts over decades to create a diverse classroom have been controversial			0
the @entity182 high court ruling in 1954 ended segregation of public schools , but sparked nationwide protests and disobedience by states who initially refused to integrate			0
in 1978 in the so - called @entity190 case , the @entity9 ruled universities have a compelling state interest in promoting diversity that allows for the use of affirmative action			0
that issue involved a reverse discrimination claim by a white man denied admission to law school			0
the issue in recent years is whether and when affirmative action programs would eventually have to be phased out as the goal of obtaining diversity is met			0
the @entity9 is considering whether the @entity206 ' admissions practices aimed at creating campus diversity violate the rights of some white applicants			2
@entity36 said he hopes that the @entity9 takes the @entity3 case			2
he said he hopes that if it rules against the ban , it also would strike down some other states ' rules against affirmative action , such as those in @entity216 that do not allow race considerations in college admissions			1
opinion : keep affirmative action but reform it @entity0 's @entity222 contributed to this report .			0
