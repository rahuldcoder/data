others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect			0
and there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news			0
some of these people do what we expect of them : they run for office , pass legislation , start a business , get hired or fired , commit a crime , make an arrest , get in accidents , hit a home run , overthrow a government , fight wars , sue an opponent , put out fires , prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses			0
they do make news , but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story			0
but every day , there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character , how they reached their decision , how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in			0
we hear about them and want to know more			1
what they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country			0
at times , there is even a mystery about them			0
what they have done may be unique , heroic , cowardly or ghastly , but they capture our imaginations			0
we want to know what makes them tick , why they believe what they do , and why they did what they did			0
