@entity0 , @entity1 -- the optimism once held by many @entity4 has been " beaten out " of them amid a lagging economy , threat of terrorism and two ongoing wars , according to a professor at @entity10			1
" all of those things ... have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be , " says @entity11 , a @entity12 citizen who teaches @entity4 history			1
@entity11 recently wrote about what he describes as " @entity4 the miserable " -- the mood swing he has seen in his 30 years in the @entity4 -- for @entity18 , a @entity12 magazine			1
read the professor 's full essay @entity11 spoke with @entity2 about his perspective			1
below is a transcript of that conversation , which has been edited : @entity2 : how would you describe the change in @entity4 since you first came to @entity4 ? @entity11 : the change is this : i do n't get the same sense of intense self confidence as i used to feel when i first came to @entity4 , even though that was a period that 's usually remembered as a pretty grim time -- the @entity32 years when there was a lot of stagnation and inflation and a general feeling of malaise			1
even so , to me , it seemed incredibly energetic here			2
people in @entity4 worked much , much harder than they did in @entity12			1
they had faith in progress			2
and there was this feeling of being intensely wide awake for the first time			2
but now , i think some of that optimism has been beaten out			1
counter : why there 's reason for optimism it 's been a very tough 10 years since 2001 , has n't it ? the attack on the @entity56 , the growing fear of terrorism , the difficulty of prevailing in the wars , obviously , more recently the recession			1
all of those things , collectively , have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be			2
@entity2 : do you attribute it to a change in @entity4 mentality or are we exposed to an array of different beliefs through the ever - expanding media landscape ? @entity11 : it 's certainly true there are far more media than there used to be ... that devote a lot of time to people who are dissatisfied			1
in other words , if somebody 's happy , that is n't news			2
it 's certainly news when they become dissatisfied in some way or they have some kind of problem to deal with			2
in that sense , i suppose there 's an inherent bias in favor of bad news			2
but i think it 's more than that			2
i 've spent most of the last 30 years in the company of academics , who also tend to be pessimistic people			2
they tend to have very high ideals for @entity4			1
when they see it does n't live up to its ideals , it makes them disappointed and sometimes embittered			0
so it may be that , if i spent more time with less educated people , i would n't have this sense quite so acutely			0
i think that 's quite possible			0
@entity2 : you write : " the decline of @entity4 confidence is n't just a temporary blip on the screen brought on by the recession			1
" elaborate on that for me			0
@entity11 : even before this recession began , i guess it was in october and november 2008 when things really started to go bad			1
already by then , i was having a feeling that the general national optimism was less emphatic than it used to be			2
in the first five or six years of the last decade , there was this feeling that things were going wrong , particularly that the wars were grinding on interminably and that it was very difficult to prevail			2
it was n't the same kind of decisive conflict as @entity129 where you 're fighting against a nation - state and you can clearly detect when you 're winning			0
the dispersal of the enemy and the very shadowy character of terrorism tends to be very depressing to confront			0
you have to maintain a high degree of vigilance and sometimes you have to take comfort in thinking what 's extraordinary is what did n't happen ; there was n't another major attack			0
that does n't feel like a victory			0
... that kind of thing is what i was attentive to when i was writing this story			0
@entity2 : if we are in this funk as you describe , is there anything wrong with that ? and how do we emerge from it ? @entity11 : the one thing i 've always admired about @entity4 is their willingness to be self - critical			1
i do think you could take the view that the very fact that so many @entity4 are willing to scrutinize their own behavior and their nation 's behavior is a sign that they do have these high ideals and they want to live up to them			1
so in that sense , you can take an optimistic view , even of pessimism -- that sooner or later , the sheer attention to it is going to cause people to recover			0
but i do think there are generational trends in @entity4 life			1
people who were brought up in the 1930s during the @entity180 -- the image of it stayed with them for a lifetime			0
... in the same way , i expect the kids who have grown up in the last few years are also going to carry the marks of this with them through life			2
they 'll come into conflict with their own children who have different generational experiences			0
it 's impossible at this stage to say what 's going to happen next			0
... but it certainly is true studying the @entity4 past , you can see how various traumatic events through the nation 's history leave a long - term impression on the people themselves			1
@entity2 : you kind of hint about this in your piece : maybe you 're just going through a midlife crisis and that 's why you might have this view			0
@entity11 : i think that 's possible , but i think i 'm describing something more real than that			1
my job is to study the @entity4 people in the past ; but also to some extent in the present			1
i really do feel this kind of change has come about			0
but you ca n't quantify it			0
you ca n't say 8 out of 10 people are optimistic -- or at least if you try to you 're really giving a false sense of definiteness			0
so what i 'm trying to do is capture a mood and compare it to a mood that i saw previously			2
... i still feel there 's an enormous amount of hope and potential and capability here , so i do n't share the feeling of gloom , which i see in the people around me			0
@entity2 : describe the " @entity239 " analogy for me ? @entity11 : the plot [ of " avatar " ] is kind of incredibly depressing			1
the corporation is at the center of this planet			0
first of all , they have invaded the planet			0
and now they 're sort of stomping on the homeland of the blue people who live there			0
and really the picture it gives you of @entity4 is incredibly depressing			1
it shows @entity4 to be greedy and incredibly violent and intolerant , and they have n't got time for this anthropological experiment that 's going on			1
but obviously , the hero is one of the @entity4			1
he 's clearly an outsider			0
... the main part of the story is a condemnation of @entity4 and its values			1
i was surprised how few reviewers said this picture is a grotesque distortion of what we 're really like			0
@entity2 : have you started receiving hate mail yet : hey , @entity270 , get the hell out of our country ? @entity11 : no , not at all			1
... it certainly is n't meant to be an attack on @entity4 ; quite the opposite			1
as i say , i 'm very , very pro-american			0
@entity2 : any final thoughts ? @entity11 : to me , coming from @entity12 , one thing that is so inspiring about the @entity4 is people really believe in human equality and they really take it seriously and they try to make it a reality			1
when i was growing up in @entity12 , nobody talked about equality			1
it 's a very hierarchical society in @entity12 , and everyone has their own place within the hierarchy and others are below them -- and then , what you 've got to do is stay in your place			1
so it felt very liberating for me to come to @entity4			2
although obviously , this is n't a society where everybody is equal in practice			0
but at least this is a place where everybody tries hard to make sure that every kid really does have the opportunities to make the most of their own abilities			0
and that 's a great thing			0
there have n't been many societies in the entire history of the world that have been like that .			0
