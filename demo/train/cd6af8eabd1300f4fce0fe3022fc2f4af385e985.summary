-- the sea of @entity2 , where @entity3 reputedly walked on water , is today home to another miracle of sorts			2
it is where hundreds of millions of birds migrate across @entity11 and a paradise for bird watchers			1
located west of the @entity15 , the area is part of the @entity17 , which stretches from northern @entity18 to central @entity19 in @entity20			1
it is akin to a superhighway of bird migration routes , creating thermal currents that raptors and other birds can ride from @entity20 to @entity27			1
@entity11 is at a bottleneck on the migratory birds ' flight path where an estimated 540 species converge			1
compare that with 460 species in @entity34 , which is 20 times bigger			0
the @entity35 , in @entity36 , is an important resting and refueling place for migrating birds on their annual journey of thousands of kilometers from @entity27 and @entity42 to @entity20 and back			1
in late autumn , tens of thousands of common cranes and pelicans flock to the area , as well as more than 25 species of raptors like the imperial eagles and spotted eagles			2
some of these birds stay in the area for the entire winter			1
it is a spectacular sight , and the area has become a popular spot for amateur bird watchers and ornithologists			1
there is even the @entity58 held every november			0
according to @entity59 , director of the @entity60 , every year the @entity35 's @entity62 bird sanctuary attracts 398 bird species , more than 400,000 visitors and 50,000 hardcore bird watchers			1
@entity66 , manager of the @entity67 , has been studying birds here for years			2
in the middle of the migration season , he will catch hundreds of birds a day , and they will be taken to the ringing station for inspection and measurement			2
he showed @entity0 the ringing procedure			0
" first , i 'm going to record the ring number , " he said , before moving on to measure the bird 's wing length , tail length and weight			0
" we are learning that there are certain species that are doing quite well with the changes , " @entity66 said , " and some species are declining , so we can tell something is happening			0
" one of these change is the war in neighboring @entity18			0
" if they arrive on a war zone , and that was land on a stop for them and they ca n't stop and rest , then they are in a problem , " @entity66 said			0
" they have to move on and sometimes their body will not be fit for that			0
" luckily food is abundant in the @entity35			2
in the 1990s , as @entity11 started to restore its wetlands , more cranes began to stop here and many -- an estimated 30,000 birds -- decided to spend the whole winter in the area			1
the cranes took a shine to the local peanut crops , costing farmers around $ 350,000 a year			0
to avoid conflict between farmers and birds , the @entity11 government now provides corn and other bird feed			1
tourists can ride along the feeding tractor and the wild birds are hardly disturbed by the gawking visitors			0
