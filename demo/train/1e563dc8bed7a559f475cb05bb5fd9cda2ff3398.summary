-- after two successive defeats , and with his proud unbeaten home @entity5 record at stake , @entity1 was never going to take any chances			1
the shock losses against @entity9 and @entity10 brought a brutal end to the @entity13 's second honeymoon at the club , and he responded by making the changes he thinks are necessary to overhauling the team 's playing style			0
so neither @entity18 , the club 's two - time player of the year , nor the skilled - but - error - prone defender @entity21 even featured in saturday 's squad to face @entity25 rival @entity23			2
back came captain @entity26 , a defensive stalwart in @entity1 's first @entity28 reign but a peripheral figure last season , along with @entity31 -- a defensive midfielder that the @entity32 worked so hard to steal from under the nose of @entity34 back in 2006			1
and those two combined to seal a 2 - 0 victory that ended a run of four games without a win , which had contributed to @entity28 's worst start to an @entity5 campaign since @entity42 owner @entity41 took over in 2003			1
@entity26 headed down an 84th - minute corner and @entity31 hooked the ball into the net -- the @entity47 's first league goal in 185 games			1
that relieved the pressure on @entity1 , indeed putting his team top of the table on goal difference ahead of sunday 's @entity55 derby and other games involving top - four hopefuls @entity58 and @entity59			1
this was @entity28 , which had more than $ 150 million worth of talent on the substitutes ' bench , winning ugly			0
it came against a struggling @entity23 team that has not won since the opening day of this season , and has not beaten @entity28 since march 2006 -- or won at @entity68 since 1979			2
" after a bad start that everybody kept telling me is the worst start for about a decade , today i go to bed and look at the table : nobody is in front of us , " @entity1 said after the match , having extended his unbeaten home record in the @entity5 to 63 matches			2
" i 'm in football for a long time and when results are not good i 'm not expecting people to speak well about our team			0
i 'm building a different team , the most difficult thing is first to change the philosophy			0
that takes a little bit of time			0
" we are not playing especially well , the results are not especially good , but the beauty of the @entity5 is that everybody loses points , so no dramas			0
i have to say , i never worked so hard as i 'm doing this season with this group of players			0
" part of @entity1 's problem has been the dilemma of trying to find a place for his wealth of attacking talent			2
he made it clear before the match that he sees @entity108 -- not @entity18 -- as his no. 10 behind the sole striker , and it was the @entity110 who settled @entity28 's nerves after a poor first half			1
@entity108 netted his second goal this season in the 51st minute , scrambling in from close range after two less - than - convincing parries by visiting goalkeeper @entity119 -- who , incidentally , was one of the few @entity5 players this weekend to wear rainbow laces in support of an anti-homophobia campaign			1
" i want to play @entity18 and @entity108 , but @entity18 has to work and adapt to a certain style of play because i 'm not ready to change @entity108 's position , " @entity1 said			2
" @entity18 has to learn to play the way i want to play , be more consistent			0
" with last week 's 2 - 1 @entity130 defeat at home to @entity132 side @entity10 echoing the draw with @entity134 that marked the end of his first @entity28 tenure in 2007 , @entity1 has a lot of hard work to return to the glory days of his successive epl crowns in his first two seasons at the club			1
" the result was better than the result against @entity9 , but i think we played much better against @entity9 than we did today , " he conceded			0
meanwhile , previous leader @entity146 crashed to a 1 - 0 defeat at home to @entity150 , its first reverse this season			1
@entity154 international defender @entity153 headed home @entity157 's corner eight minutes after halftime to clinch the visitors ' second win this season , having been the last team to beat @entity146 in the league -- at home back in march			1
@entity9 built on the win over @entity28 by coming from behind to win 3 - 2 at @entity165 , scoring twice after home midfielder @entity166 was sent off to be the @entity5 's only unbeaten team with two wins and three draws @entity166 had put @entity165 2 - 1 ahead with a penalty , but received a second booking with eight minutes to play -- which allowed @entity173 defender @entity172 to fire in a second superb free - kick			1
two minutes later on - loan @entity28 striker @entity175 headed in the winner , having come on as a halftime replacement , despite a collision with @entity165 's @entity179 that left the @entity181 international needing lengthy treatment			0
promoted @entity182 moved up to mid-table with a 3 - 2 win at @entity185 , thanks to a 76th - minute volley from @entity47 forward @entity188			0
on - loan @entity190 striker @entity189 had twice put @entity185 ahead , but his goals were canceled out by @entity192 and @entity193			0
@entity194 stayed bottom after a third successive defeat , with the club 's former striker @entity197 scoring @entity200 's opening goal in a 3 - 0 victory			2
@entity202 bounced back from three successive defeats by winning 1 - 0 at @entity204 , as new @entity206 striker @entity205 netted the only goal after the home side 's @entity208 missed a penalty .			1

@entity108 and @entity31 score in @entity28 's 2 - 0 win at home to @entity23
@entity1 's team goes top of the @entity5 on goal difference
@entity1 drops *fan* *favorite* @entity18 and brings back @entity26
