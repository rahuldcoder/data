-- when preparing to propose marriage , create a moment that 's right for her and that accurately reflects -- in a beautiful , emotional and thoughtful way -- what 's special about you			1
if you 're a great couple , those two things wo n't conflict			1
she loves you , so she 'll love you expressing who you are in a moment that 's totally focused on her			1
one of the biggest mistakes people make is thinking that there should be a crowd of strangers as onlookers			2
for some women , that 's just right			2
but for most , it is n't			2
it 's fine for women to drop hints to their boyfriends about the general kind of proposal they would want , i.e. , how public or not			1
do not dictate the specifics , and remember it 's not just about you ; it 's about him expressing himself in a beautiful , fragile moment of bravery and humility that 's all about love			1
celebrate him as much as he 's celebrating you			2
setting the scene sometimes the most magical moment you can create is in a space that you have all to yourselves			0
i tricked my wife into ending up with me alone on the stage of the @entity46 in @entity47 , when it was dark			0
the spotlight came on , our song played through the room			0
why i proposed marriage in public i got another couple into a major league baseball park when it was empty			1
she thought they were on a private tour for just a few members of her family			1
when they reached the pitcher 's mound , her boyfriend went down on one knee , as their song echoed throughout the stadium and a video about them played on the @entity74			0
then the sprinklers came on , getting them just a little wet			0
@entity79 ! who got it right ? of the recent sprinkling of public marriage proposals making the rounds , the " lip dub " video speaks to my point			1
clearly it thrilled the bride - to - be and was an expression of the future groom 's personality			1
no big crowd of strangers , just , presumably , people they would both want to be there			0
it 's clever , original , positive , adorable			0
they 're not pretending to be all professional and perfect			0
i 'm not worried about something going wrong in a plan like that , because it would n't have mattered			0
it was n't about a perfect show -- it was about joy and a celebration of love			1
the problem is that guys see videos like this and feel pressured to do something that 's public or viral , and they lose track of the point			1
does it have to be public ? your proposal is not a performance ! it 's not about proving to the world how cool you are			1
and its value does not lie in how many people witness it , watch it later or hear about it			0
its value lies entirely in how special it is to the two of you , and the kind of story it gives you both to share and celebrate for the rest of your lives			0
what 's with public marriage proposals ? that 's the potential problem with the proliferation of public proposal events , with men trying to outdo each other and create @entity147 moments			1
if you enter that game , you lose the point			0
there 's a high that comes from a magic proposal			2
and no matter how many people see it , only the two of you get that " high			0
" if you 're going for magic in that moment , that 's the central feeling you want to achieve -- not the ego boost of strangers praising you			0
close the deal another important note on proposals : stick the landing ! i ca n't tell you how many guys plan for the buildup and the question , but then ooze awkwardness and have no clue what to do after she says yes ! especially when there 's a crowd of people there and the applause is over			2
have a plan for what you 're going to do at the very end of the magic proposal event			2
for some couples , the simpler the better			0
how did @entity0 's @entity184 become a proposal expert ? watch his @entity187 talk to find out ! would you propose in public or want your partner to do so ? share your take in the comments section below .			1

@entity184 says a marriage proposal should reflect the personality of the couple
a public proposal should be well - thought - out and not for the *benefit* of *observers*
public or private , a proposal should be an expression of love and *commitment*
your proposal is not a performance , but you should be confident enough to seal the deal
