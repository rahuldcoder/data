authorities filed an aggravated murder charge against @entity1 related to the slaying of @entity12 , whose remains were uncovered last december by teens exploring a steep ravine near the town of @entity17			1
the count is the first filed against @entity1 since he admitted to serial killings in 2003			2
" the @entity23 have the right to face the man who killed @entity12 and the opportunity to remind us all about what was taken from them , " @entity21 prosecutor @entity20 said before the plea			1

forty - six of the bodies were found near @entity44 -- which is part of @entity21 -- while two were in @entity46 , @entity47			2
in a plea deal dating to november 2003 , when he was sentenced on 48 counts of aggravated murder , prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty against @entity1 if he agreed to " plead guilty to any and all future cases ( in @entity21 ) where his confession could be corroborated by reliable evidence , " @entity20 said			1
" @entity1 confessed to killing @entity12 , but he was unable to provide sufficient details to warrant a charge , " @entity20 said			1
" the discovery of ms. @entity12 's remains now gives us the evidence we need to file this charge			2
" once he entered the guilty plea , @entity1 was given a 49th life sentence and returned to his prison cell at the @entity67 in @entity68			1
@entity1 may still face the death penalty if convicted of murder outside @entity21			1
@entity20 said his predecessor , @entity71 , opted to eliminate that option in @entity21 in hopes of resolving more cold cases			0

" it was n't about what @entity1 deserved			2
... it was about what the families ' deserved			0

" her remains were found about 100 feet away from where searchers in 2003 found another of @entity1 's victims , according to @entity20			1
the @entity105 @entity104 had made periodic visits to the area over the past seven years , but found nothing new , he said			0
@entity1 was arrested in 2001 in @entity21 and accused in the murders of five women			1
two years later , when prosecutors were preparing seven separate murder cases , he offered to confess to those seven and 41 other murders			0
the " @entity1 " moniker came from a river south of @entity44 where @entity1 began dumping his victims in 1982			0
most of the women were prostitutes , officials say			0
@entity1 has said he targeted prostitutes " because i thought i could kill as many as i wanted without getting caught			0
" he said he killed because he hated prostitutes and did n't want to pay them for sex , and claimed he killed so many women he had a hard time keeping them straight			0
while not indicating any news on the horizon , @entity20 did not close the door to further murder charges against @entity1			2
" it 's quite possible that more remains will be found someday , " @entity20 said .			0
