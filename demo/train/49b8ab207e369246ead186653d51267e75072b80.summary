-- your @entity2 profile is about to have a lot more " you " in it			1
@entity2 announced a feature on thursday called @entity7 of you that lets people tag their own images with the @entity2 handles of friends or anyone with an account on @entity2			1
previously , you had to call out people in photo captions , and they would get a news alert pointing them to the image			0
the @entity7 of you feature is available as an app update for @entity19 and @entity21 users immediately			2
tagged images are collected in a new section in your profile and wo n't show up in your main photo feed			1
you ca n't tag other people 's images , only your own			0
@entity2 says these new tags can be populated only with usernames , not hashtags , though hashtags still work just fine in the comments			2
to check whether a photo has any people tags , tap once on the images , and the names will appear			0
click a name to go to that profile			0
with tagging , of course , comes the potential for embarrassment			0
@entity2 has created a built - in way to hide tagged photos you do n't like from your your profile			1
if an image is extra unflattering , you can remove it altogether or report it as inappropriate			0
if you 're super paranoid , you can turn on a setting to require your approval before any tagged photos show up in your profile			1
@entity2 will show your tagged images by default starting may 16 , so if you want to turn on settings to hide them , you have some time to make the proper adjustments			1
it 's no secret that people spend a lot of time on @entity2			2
between posting photos , tinkering with filters , creating hashtags and browsing streams , the average user spends about four hours a month on the photo - sharing platform , according to @entity69			2
the new photos of you feature has a good shot at increasing that time , adding a whole new way to look through old memories , admire your own good looks or see even more of what your friends are up to .			0

@entity2 releases ' photos of @entity80 ' feature to add tagging
tagged photos will be collected in a new section on user 's profile page
users will be able to untag unflattering photos or tweak settings to *screen* tags
