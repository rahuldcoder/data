-- some people hire florists and caterers when planning their wedding			0
former @entity6 employee @entity5 brought on a programmer to create a custom app. that personal app grew into @entity10 , a real product that helps people design wedding sites , and @entity5 went on to create her own lifestyle how - to company called @entity16 , which combines crafting , homemaking and a bit of tech. in the year since it launched , @entity16 has created tons of step - by - step posts , filmed how - to videos staring @entity5 , brought in user - generated projects and started selling merchandise such as crafting starter kits , books and subscription boxes called @entity28			1
for $ 20 a month , @entity16 will deliver a @entity30 box filled with crafting materials and instructions for projects such as gloves that work on touchscreen devices			1
last week , @entity36 entered its newest stage by branching out into content aggregation with a feature called @entity5 's @entity40			1
the company is pulling in posts from 25 popular crafting and style sites , including @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , and hand - picking the best posts to share with the @entity36 readers			1
inspired by the maker movement and the tech culture of @entity52 , @entity5 wanted to combine her interest in technology and crafting with the popular @entity50			1
" there was really no voice or teacher , specifically on the female side , who was really sharing all of these new innovations with those inspired to live creatively , " she said of the maker culture			0
the projects on @entity36 are fairly simple and meant to be completed quickly , but many incorporate cool gadgetry such as @entity67 and laser printers , or wired elements such as @entity71 kits , which are do - it - yourself computing and circuitry kits			1
there are recipes for no - bake peanut butter and jelly pie , instructions on how to create homemade headbands in less than five minutes , and plenty of @entity81 app and accessory round - ups			0
one of @entity5 's favorite recent projects was an @entity85 cowboy hat she wore to the @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity88			1
using @entity90 pieces , she stitched wire into the hat to spell out her @entity94 handle			0
" being from @entity88 , it really showed who i am : a little bit style , a little bit country and a little bit tech , " said @entity5			1
@entity5 says she aspires to be a combination of @entity101 and @entity102			2
she worked with @entity104 ceo @entity103 in the past , and @entity103 is an investor in @entity16 the company raised a $ 1.25 million seed round of funding last year from a group that also included @entity110 , the former chairman of @entity111 and co-founder of @entity113			1
in an effort to differentiate herself from the doyennes of @entity117 like @entity118 , @entity5 avoids saying the word " craft , " which she thinks makes people think of popsicle sticks			1
instead she enthusiastically uses the word " hack " to describe any time - or money - saving trick			0
for example , she hacked a @entity128 fitness tracking device by wrapping the bracelet in gold wire to make it look less like a sports accessory and more like jewelry			0
at @entity135 , @entity5 's agreeable , bubbly personality is a big part of the product			2
her photographs are used to illustrate the various projects			0
she stars in a the how - to videos online			0
and she is constantly promoting the brand in magazines and on tv programs			0
next week , she 's headed to the " today " show , where she will demonstrate how to use the @entity146 site to print metals in @entity67			0
this personality - centric approach to branding is all part of her larger plan to emulate some very successful companies			0
" we 're trying to recreate what it is to have a person as the core of the brand , " said @entity5			2
" in the past it was @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 ; all these huge companies that have lasted for decades had a person 's name in the brand			0
" @entity5 's own homemaking skills are self - taught			1
the 27 - year - old studied business and communications at the @entity171 in @entity87 before moving to @entity52 , where she worked in product and marketing at @entity174 and @entity6			1
though she has no formal design experience , she says she planned parties when she was younger and taught herself how to sew and cook			0
@entity5 says that , like her , the current generation is interested in homemaking and @entity117 , but suffers from a lack of time and proper training			2
@entity5 says that with so many people 35 and younger growing up with two working parents , there 's been less time for passing on cooking , crafting and @entity117 techniques			2
" this generation specifically , as opposed to older generations , did n't spend enough time on the domestic arts , " said @entity5 , who aims to fill in the blanks for today 's busy , stylish and proudly geeky @entity117 fans .			2
