-- try this for a spine - tingling moment : an immensely popular novelist who specializes in eerie , conspiratorial mysteries portrays an evildoer who is , gulp , an awful lot like yourself			0
and the word " popular " does n't really come close to describing this novelist , whose every book is launched in multiple languages and shoved into movie production ( starring @entity13 ) before the manuscript is bound in hard copy			2
it 's @entity17 , whose " inferno , " the latest tale of @entity19 , the @entity20 iconographer - turned - homicide - hunter , hinges on the deeds of a dastardly biologist who kidnaps the director general of the @entity24 and compels her to heed his insanity while locked inside the @entity26 in @entity27			1
i am the only trained biologist working in the @entity31 headquarters of the @entity26 , where i am senior fellow for global health			1
i 've never kidnapped @entity24 director - general dr. @entity33 , but i have been known to corner her for some whispered one - on - ones			0
the day after " inferno " was launched with the usual @entity17 - associated brouhaha , my brother e-mailed " @entity39 ! " telling me he was devouring the thing on his e-reader			1
all day long i received notes from worried friends and family , concerned that @entity17 's conspiracy - minded readership would turn its sights on the council , or me , and my global health work			1
@entity17 's ability to raise this kind of intrigue was demonstrated with his first blockbuster , " the @entity50 " which spawned an entire genre of dark @entity53 - oriented novels that imagine self - mutilating , power - grabbing monsters lurking in medieval dungeons beneath @entity56			1
with " @entity68 , " @entity17 had millions of readers convinced that an 18th - century group called the @entity64 was secretly pulling strings of power all over the world , the group allegedly ( in internet conspiracy canon ) dominated by @entity60 and his pals at ... you guessed it , the @entity26			1
so it was with more than a little trepidation that i opened " inferno " on my @entity72			0
i can now report that @entity17 has produced a silly , but interesting and provocative book , delving into biologist @entity76 's old " @entity82 " ideas , synthetic biology , dual - use research , human genome alteration and even hypothetical germ line mutation of people			1
perhaps @entity17 has grown bored with only castigating @entity83 , for he now chucks his aspersions on science			2
of course it 's not realistic or accurate science , given the author 's penchant for mixing @entity91 's 14th - century poem " inferno " with 21st - century gene sequencing			2
@entity91 's original " inferno " guided readers through the most explicit journey of hell and purgatory ever committed to paper			2
@entity17 's " inferno " takes a 21st - century spin through a hell of man - made microbes , pandemics and human overpopulation			1
the @entity17 hell is just close enough to the edges of biological reality to make for thriller reading			2
biology as a discipline is indeed delving into human - directed evolution and creation of life forms in ways that ought to be scrutinized			0
and while the real work of science is not dark and genocidal , as @entity17 portrays , there are risks of accidental release of modified organisms and , less likely , terrorism that merit wider attention			0
for those who fear @entity17 's version of inferno might come true , here is some spoiler - alert news from the real world			1
the private @entity131 that " inferno " imagines the @entity24 owns , jetting about the world to stop disease , is not just a fantasy , it would be impossible			0
far from affording its own jet , @entity24 is in deep financial straits , now facing its third year of painful budget deficits and layoffs , leaving its epidemic response division tapped - out for 2013 , @entity136 has told me			0
in @entity17 's imaginings , the @entity144 's version of the @entity145 has a huge secret swat team of hulking , fully armed , military - trained disease - fighters that swoop into countries , violating all local law with impunity , to stop epidemics			1
of course there is no such team , nor does the budget - strained @entity156 @entity145 have @entity158 - wearing , @entity159 - toting microbe hunters			0
on @entity17 's version of planet earth these disease - fighers have such limitless power that prime ministers immediately take their calls , and armies and police forces the world over are at their command			1
@entity33 might dream of having enough clout to command an obstinate national leader to cease covering up his country 's epidemic , but in truth her only tools are persuasion , bluffing and the rage of world media			0
would n't it be sweet if the impoverished @entity24 actually did have a budget large enough to finance an agency @entity131 and rapid response team ? the @entity72 is switched off			0
back to work at the @entity26 , trying to create and push policies that spare populations of millions the scourges of disease , malnutrition and climate change			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

@entity191 : evil **character** in @entity17 's " inferno " *alarmingly* close to her own job
**character** is biologist at @entity26 , but *similarity* ends there , she says
she says book silly but raises provocative issues about potentially *dangerous* biology
@entity205 : book makes council seem *nefarious* , who well - *funded*
