-- a few million @entity2 users woke up to a new operating system this week , the much - heralded @entity4 , the biggest change in @entity7 's smartphone operating system since the phone was first released in 2007			1
it 's a different look and feel , for sure			2
but for those who may fear having to learn some whole new way of using a phone , rest assured : not much has been fundamentally altered			0
it 's still very much the same operating system you 've made a part of your life			2
that 's really the news here : @entity7 is taking its users one baby step toward the next mobile platform			1
and while it may indicate something about where @entity7 hopes to bring smartphone interfaces in the future , this incremental step may say more about @entity7 's diminishing ability to make changes in our computing lives by decree			1
back in the @entity33 era , @entity7 could force its dedicated user base to go anywhere @entity36 told them			1
the original , @entity39 - inspired @entity38 was the first major desktop that did not offer a floppy drive			0
users grumbled and panicked , but they did as @entity36 told them , and now we live in a world where many readers do n't even know what a floppy drive is			1
then @entity33 took away serial ports , and so on , continually forcing new changes on @entity7 users for their own good			1
consumers even lined up to purchase the @entity53 on @entity33 's command ; they did n't have any real need for the thing but trusted that @entity33 knew best			1
the ongoing success of the tablet seems to suggest that he did			0
@entity7 's new operating system does n't ask users to make such a leap of faith			1
yes , the new @entity4 is brighter and more colorful and the icons are simpler and less three - dimensional			1
it looks like a new phone			0
and the fonts are more streamlined and communicative			0
instead of using lines to separate things , font shapes and sizes are used more effectively to delineate items in lists -- making everything a bit more airy			2
most significantly , the " things " depicted in the new os look less like things			0
there are no little binders drawn on notebooks , no details on buttons , no leatherette address book and no shadows behind pages			0
if anything , @entity7 is weaning us off the metaphorical desktop , trying to bring us into a virtual universe where we no longer depend on the familiar anchors of the " real " world to relate effectively to our applications			1
on a smartphone , an address book is not really an address book , after all			0
it 's an application that lets us search through data about our contacts			2
a notepad is not a pad with paper ; it is a way of saving text			0
while the real world metaphors initially helped us understand what all these things were for , apps need n't be bound by the limits of real world devices			2
for the computing world to develop further , it needs to be freed of the obligation to do everything in ways that reflect real world processes			2
perhaps surprisingly , @entity114 already accomplished this last year			2
with nothing to lose , the company worked with @entity117 to develop a smartphone and tablet operating system called @entity121 that no longer has a desktop , as we traditionally think of it			0
instead of depicting icons against a background , @entity121 breaks the screen up into tiles that deliver live feeds of whatever is happening in the apps			0
streams of tweets , incoming e-mails or changing weather all flow from their tiles in real time			0
meanwhile , the apps themselves , once opened , have almost no lines or grids in them at all			0
the incoming e-mail list ( there 's no in " box " anymore ) is broken up with space , not lines			0
everything is accomplished with innovative font selection and sizing			0
@entity114 's operating system represents the future of computing			1
it was also a market failure , at least in the short run			0
that 's because @entity114 does n't have the power or charisma to demand that users follow it into the unknown			1
people followed @entity33 because they believed in his vision -- even if they did n't know what it was			1
@entity114 does n't enjoy that benefit of the doubt			1
but today , without @entity33 , neither does @entity7			1
that 's why -- instead of dragging us kicking and screaming into the future @entity114 has already developed -- @entity7 is trying to lead us there one easy step at a time			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			2

@entity171 : @entity7 's new @entity4 represents incremental step into future
he says new design is right for a *digital* world ; it does n't rely on icons of *physical* world
@entity7 is following @entity114 in making this change in approach , @entity171 says
@entity171 : @entity7 lost ability it had under @entity33 to force users to follow its lead
