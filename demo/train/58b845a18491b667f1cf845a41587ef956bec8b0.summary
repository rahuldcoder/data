-- now you see it , now you do n't			0
that 's the logic behind the vanishing spray being used at this year 's @entity6 in @entity7			1
if you watched thursday 's opening @entity7 - @entity9 match , you may have seen it : before a free kick in the first half , a referee pulled a spray can out of a holster and squirted a white line on the field			1
no , the @entity6 refs are n't wannabe graffiti artists			2
for the first time , @entity20 referees are using the special spray to paint a temporary white line 10 yards from the free kick spot , marking the safe area into which opposing players can not encroach			1
the spray disappears after one minute			2
this , although somewhat awkward to watch , addresses a problem for referees and players alike : although they 're supposed to remain 10 yards away , opposing players have frequently crept closer to the free - kick taker in an effort to disrupt the kick , starting countless arguments about fairness			1
the vanishing spray , which was an immediate hit thursday on @entity37 , is the brainchild of @entity39 journalist and entrepreneur @entity38			1
" it started seven or eight years ago when i was playing in a championship played amongst former school members , " @entity38 told @entity41			0
" in the 88th minute , we were losing 1 - 0 and won a free kick on the edge of the area			2
when i took the kick , the wall ( of opposing players ) was three meters away			2
the referee did n't book anyone and did n't do anything			0
we lost the game and driving home later , with a mixture of anger and bitterness , i thought that we must invent something to stop this			0
" the spray is called 9:15 @entity61 , or 10 yards expressed in meters			1
it 's already been used in games the past several years by @entity64			1
" we find the vanishing spray to be extremely useful and very effective in ensuring the defenders are 10 yards from the ball , " said @entity65 , training and development manager for the @entity68 , which supplies officials for @entity64			1
" the spray makes it clear where the ball is to be placed and where the defenders have to stand			0
since the use of spray we experience very few problems in achieving the ... ( minimum ) distance			0
" @entity65 said the spray has been welcomed by officials and is no hassle for them to carry during games			2
if nothing else , @entity38 and his spray already have some high - profile supporters , including @entity91 soccer superstar @entity90			0
" i think it 's a great idea , " he said in a testimonial on the 9:15 website			0
" use a spray to mark the distance between the barrier and the kicker can be a great help			0

refs spray a temporary white line 10 yards from the spot of free kicks
the line keeps opposing players back and disappears after a minute
