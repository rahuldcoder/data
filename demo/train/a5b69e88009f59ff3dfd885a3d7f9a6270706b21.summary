" if they were to sit down with the @entity2 , they would find him to be a man of peace and reconciliation , " @entity9 said			1

the @entity76 is generally measured in its criticism of @entity6 as it seeks to manage a booming trade relationship and a desire to enlist @entity6 cooperation on nuclear standoffs with @entity138 and @entity139			2

in 1959 , the then - 24 - year - old @entity14 leader fled @entity5 during a failed uprising against the @entity6			0
@entity122 said she did not think the meeting -- which the administration had worked to downplay -- would seriously affect @entity16 - @entity6 relations			1

i do this every time i meet with [ @entity6 leaders ]			2
" the promise of good intentions did not seem to assuage the @entity6 government , who labeled the @entity2 's work " separatist activities			2
" " the words and deeds of the @entity2 in the past decades show he is a political refugee engaging in secessionist activities under the cloak of religion , " the @entity96 's @entity95 said			2
@entity178 , the @entity179 secretary of @entity5 , had even harsher words for the @entity26 spiritual leader			0
