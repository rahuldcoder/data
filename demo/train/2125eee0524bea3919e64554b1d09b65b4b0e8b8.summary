-- three - year - old @entity1 reads at a fifth - grade level			1
she taught herself fluent @entity3 using her parents ' @entity4			2
" from 12 to 18 months old , we 'd be driving around in the car , and she would recite her bedtime story from the night before , " her dad , @entity6 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity7			2
" she did n't just recite them ; she recited them exactly			0
" @entity1 is the youngest member of @entity16 's @entity15 chapter			0
@entity15 ( @entity17 ) is an organization for people with iqs in the top 2 %			0
the average @entity20 is 100			1
@entity15 has more than 55,000 members nationally			0
you 'd probably recognize some of the more famous ones : @entity25 , who plays @entity26 on @entity28 's " @entity27 " ; @entity30 , the author of " @entity29 ? " ; the @entity31 ( ok , he 's a fictional member )			0
but what does an iq score really tell us about a person ? will @entity1 be a genius for life ? and if you still ca n't speak @entity3 at age 50 , should you just give up ? what your iq score means an @entity20 , or @entity20 , is a measure of what psychologists call our " fluid and crystallized intelligence			1
" put simply , an iq test measures your reasoning and problem - solving abilities			1
there are different kinds of iq tests , but most analyze your visual , mathematical and language abilities as well as your memory and information processing speed			1
a licensed psychologist administers a series of subtests ; the results are then combined into one score : your iq			1
" anybody with very high iq , they have the ability to manipulate , process and interpret information at a deeper level and a higher speed than the average person , " explained @entity15 's gifted youth specialist , @entity62			1
what your specific numerical score means depends on the test you take			1
@entity20 is really a measure of how well you do on a test compared with other people your age			1
scores are generally shown on a bell curve			1
the average score is 100			1
people to the far left or far right of the curve are outliers			0
@entity1 , for example , is on the far right of the curve for children her age			1
@entity89 : how smart are you ? take the @entity92 test and find out what it does n't mean " the difficulty with these kinds of tests is that they 're a snapshot , " @entity95 said			1
" we see what the kid looks like on this day , on this particular test , with this particular tester			0
" an iq score does n't measure your practical intelligence : knowing how to make things work , says @entity110 , a professor of psychology at the @entity112			1
it does n't measure your creativity			1
it does n't measure your curiosity			2
it does n't tell your parents or teachers about your emotional readiness			0
maybe as a 5 - year - old , you can read and understand @entity122			2
but are you prepared to deal with stories about war - torn countries or prisoners on death row ? it would be a mistake , @entity95 says , to look at a child with a high iq as nothing more than a brain			1
like any trait -- blue eyes , big feet -- their iq is just one part of who they are			2
your iq can change over time a lot of factors can affect your iq score over time			1
how familiar you are with standardized tests			2
@entity110 's research has shown that children from lower socioeconomic levels adopted into a middle - class family often increase their iq scores by 15 to 20 points			1
" heritability is not as great as some people ( believe ) , " @entity110 said			0
" environmental factors are very potent			0
" in one study , researchers tested 33 adolescents ' intelligence once and then again four years later			0
in that short amount of time , some of their iq scores varied by more than 20 points			1
the changes matched with structural and functional changes in their brains			0
kids who are geniuses at age 2 rarely stay that way , experts say			1
it 's easier , @entity95 explains , for young children to distinguish themselves on the curve			0
in other words , it 's easy to spot a genius 3 - year - old when she 's reading at a fifth - grade level and speaks fluent @entity3			2
but what makes one 47 - year - old more intelligent than another ? is it education ? life experience ? their ability to put together a piece of furniture from @entity187 ? you 're smarter than your ancestors since the early 1990s , when iq tests were first standardized , researchers have seen substantial increases in iq scores with each passing generation			1
so the average 10 - year - old today would score higher on the same test than a 10 - year - old from 1954			1
this does n't mean we necessarily have bigger brains than our great - great - grandfathers ; it just means we 've improved our abilities to think logically , solve problems and / or use our abilities in hypothetical situations			1
it 's known as the @entity207 , for moral philosopher @entity208			0
" the cars that people drove in 1900 have altered because the roads are better and because of technology , " @entity208 said in a @entity209 last year			0
" and our minds have altered , too			0
we 've gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world			0
" for instance , education has changed			0
we 've learned to classify the world , to compare groups like animals or modes of transportation , @entity208 said			0
we 've also been taught to accept hypothetical situations ( you remember algebra , right ? )			0
our ancestors dealt only with what was right in front of them			0
our jobs have also changed			0
in the early 1900s , only 3 % of @entity237 had professions that were " cognitively demanding , " @entity208 said			0
today , 35 % of us do			0
as such we 're used to solving complex , hypothetical problems , like the ones on an iq test			1
health factors may have had an influence as well			0
studies have shown that early childhood immunization rates are a big predictor of a nation 's average iq score			1
so decreasing infectious diseases worldwide may have attributed to the overall increase in subsequent generations ' iq scores			1
" from an energetics standpoint , a developing human will have difficulty building a brain and fighting off infectious diseases at the same time , as both are very metabolically costly tasks , " the authors of one study wrote			2
not a genius ? do n't panic you probably remember the dreaded sat or @entity265 test you took in high school			2
that 's a type of iq test			2
but @entity110 believes that a student 's grade - point average is a better predictor of their success than their test scores			1
" gpa is raw smarts times how hard you work times self - control times a lot of other things			2
that 's true for success in life , " he said			2
" i see graduate students with extremely high @entity286 who ca n't achieve much because they 're lacking in curiosity			2
... they 're lacking the ability to get along with people			0
" having a high @entity20 is not a guarantee of success , @entity95 agrees , just as having a lower iq is not a guarantee of failure			1
good habits , perseverance and a strong work ethic are just as important as intelligence			0
" if you do n't develop those other qualities , you can waste a smart iq , " she said			2
@entity95 recommends that parents view their homes as a petri dish , one where they 're trying to grow their children			0
that means lots of time spent together , interacting , and lots of books , building blocks and board games			2
" the most important thing we can do for kids is to play with them , " she said .			0

@entity20 is a measure of your reasoning and problem - solving abilities
your score *reflects* how well you did on a series of tests compared with others your age
your iq can change over time , and scores have improved between generations
having a high @entity20 is not a guarantee of success , experts say
