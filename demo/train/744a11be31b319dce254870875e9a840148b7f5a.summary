@entity0 -- republicans kept the pressure on the president 's @entity4 pick friday , pushing the idea that judge @entity7 is an activist judge who will bring a leftist agenda to the bench			1
judge @entity7 in the @entity10 with vice president @entity11 and president @entity12			1
meanwhile , the @entity10 tried to soften remarks @entity7 made in 2001 that have rankled conservatives , who say her assertion that her experiences as a @entity18 woman might make her judgments more sound than those of a white man brands her as a racist			1
" i 'm sure she would have restated it , but if you look at the entire sweep of the essay she wrote , what 's clear is that she was simply saying that her life experiences will give her information about the struggles and hardships that people are going through that will make her a good judge , " president @entity12 said in an interview with @entity25 's @entity24			1
@entity7 , a @entity41 @entity40 judge who would be the first @entity42 on the @entity4 if she is confirmed , spoke on her reflections as a @entity18 judge during a 2001 speech at the @entity46			1
different perspectives brought on by individual experiences , she said , create a " diversity of opinion " even within groups , and those perspectives will especially differ from the majority in a white male - dominated society			2
pointing out that studies show " women and people of color ... report in significantly higher percentages than white men that their gender and race has shaped their careers , " @entity7 said that the idea of " impartiality is an aspiration because it denies the fact that we are by our experiences making different choices than others			1
" thus , she said -- in the remarks that have offended conservatives -- " i would hope that a wise @entity18 woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life			2
" " let us not forget that wise men like @entity85 and @entity86 voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society , " she said			0
" until 1972 , no @entity4 case ever upheld the claim of a woman in a gender discrimination case			2
" @entity10 press secretary @entity95 said that @entity7 's " word choice in 2001 was poor			1
" " she was simply making the point that personal experiences are relevant to the process of judge , " he said , " that your personal experiences make you have a tendency to make you more aware of certain facts and certain cases , that your experiences impact your understanding			0
i think we all agree with that and that on a court that is collegial , that it can help others that are trying to wrestle with the facts of those cases			0
" @entity95 took issue with a former congressman 's comparison of the @entity42 civil rights group that sponsored that speech with the @entity121			1
" it 's sort of hard to completely quantify the outrage i think almost anybody would feel at the notion that you are being compared to somebody who used to be a member of the @entity121 , " @entity95 said , referring to remarks made by former @entity130 rep. @entity130 , who condemned @entity7 on @entity1 thursday for her membership in the @entity133 , an organization he called " a @entity135 without the hoods or the nooses			1
" on @entity1 friday , @entity139 president @entity138 disputed @entity130 's statements about the 40 - year - old group			1
the motto , she said , is not " all for the race , nothing for the rest , " the organization is very much " mainstream , " the group 's name does not translate to " the race " as understood in @entity150			2
our name has a long history to it , but the bottom line is that words in @entity150 and in @entity157 , have different meanings , " she said			0
" race in @entity157 , @entity139 in @entity157 , has a broader meaning			2
it means the people , the community			0
and it really is meant to be a very inclusive term			0
it comes from the term ' @entity167 , ' the cosmic race , which is a very inclusive term			0
" @entity7 's remarks drew charges of racism from former house speaker @entity172 , radio talker @entity173 and others , although @entity177 sen. @entity176 of @entity178 said such language about the nominee was " terrible			1
" and former house majority leader @entity186 , also of @entity178 , slammed @entity139 and another @entity42 civil rights organization , the @entity181 , as " a bunch of radical leftists that try to make the world believe that they speak for @entity42 , " but said the debate about @entity7 's background " is racist in itself			1
" " i am disgusted that we are considering her nomination because she is @entity42 , " he told @entity1			0
" she has a world view			0
she has a judicial temperament			0
and that 's what we ought to be looking at			2
it 's racist in itself to have this debate			0
" @entity186 add that " in my mind " @entity7 is not qualified for a seat at the @entity4			1
" she 's an activist , " he said			2
" she 's a judicial activist , and i 've worked my entire career against judicial activism			2
and if @entity12 -- @entity12 could n't have appointed a more activist judge , and , therefore , i do n't think she 's qualified			1
i do n't want somebody writing law from the bench			0
" most conservatives oppose what they call " judicial activism , " which they define as enacting legislation through rulings , although it generally refers to reaching beyond the @entity218 to bring rulings in line with contemporary values			0
many support a " strict constructionist " judicial philosophy that requires judges to apply the text of the @entity218 as written to the matters at hand , although there are differences of opinion about what the term actually means , even among conservatives			0
the true opposite of judicial activism , however , is not strict constructionism , but rather judicial restraint , which urges judges to defer to @entity240 whenever possible .			0
