-- @entity1 has encountered it all : automated operators , interminable phone trees , customer service representatives who 've " never heard of " widely advertised promotions			1
bad or no customer service can drive consumers crazy			1
but the public relations account director from @entity12 , @entity13 , says her most memorable moment was when a customer service rep informed her that her house was n't there			1
" my husband and i were trying to get service from a cable tv provider and were told by a representative that our address did n't exist , " she says			2
" they said they could n't help us or sign us up for service , even though our neighbors across the street had cable			2
it probably took eight hours to get it all straightened out			0
" the downfall of service thanks to outsourcing , labyrinthine answering systems and unresponsive corporations , many have come to dread what 's paradoxically known as " customer care			1
" " people get lost in that maze of ' press 1 for this and press 2 for that , ' " says @entity40 , president of @entity41 , a customer service training center in @entity43 , @entity44			1
" years ago , the customer was the most important thing , but today , businesses large and small are indifferent			2
" real service is such a rarity that some frustrated folks are turning into what @entity57 calls " consumer vigilantes			1
" the vigilantes blog about battles with customer service departments ; they use the @entity63 to track down high - ranking employees ' e-mails and direct lines			1
surfing for satisfaction after weeks of bad tv reception ( and repeated requests for help ) following @entity71 , @entity72 , an image coach from @entity74 , found a @entity76 executive on @entity77 , a social networking site			2
" i tweeted him and asked if he could help and he tweeted right back and said , ' here 's my e-mail , shoot me your account number , ' " says @entity79			2
" by the end of the day , five trucks , three supervisors and two technicians were at my house and we had the best cable reception we 've ever had			0
all it took was finding a person high enough on the food chain to fix the problem			1
" @entity96 , a motivational speaker from @entity97 , @entity98 , went up the corporate ladder in a creative way after unsuccessful calls to an automaker about her problematic car			0
@entity96 dressed up as a " nutty character " and vented her frustrations in a @entity107 video she forwarded to the executive offices of @entity109			0
" my friends thought i was nuts and that no one would ever see it or respond			0
but 16 hours after i e-mailed them the link , i heard back from the company			2
they loved the video and helped me resolve my car issues			0
" the new word of mouth web - based customer empowerment is rapidly changing customer service , says @entity122 , co-founder and chief community officer for @entity124 , an online clearinghouse for complaints and responses			1
" with blogs and social networks and the way information can be posted so freely , word of mouth is incredibly powerful , " says @entity128			0
" it 's more and more difficult for companies to survive without learning to embrace this new era			2
they do n't have a choice but to start to provide better customer service , especially in hard economic times			1
" @entity128 says nearly 300,000 registered users interact on @entity124 with nearly 18,500 companies -- from big guns like @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 to startups like @entity148 and @entity149			0
customers post questions or complaints which company reps ( or other customers ) try to resolve			1
" we 've had situations where a customer will come in furious and the company will step in and do a stellar response and then the customer will go away happy , " says @entity128			1
" and it all happens in a public way			0
we believe in the good , the bad and the ugly all being out there			1
" the dark side the ugly stuff is not always on the company 's part , says @entity167 , 31 , a pr account executive from @entity168 , @entity169			1
" i worked for an energy company for 2 Â½ years and i once got a call from a woman who did n't have power at her restaurant , " he says			2
" the problem was on her end -- she had n't had all the inspections she needed -- but she was livid			2
she said , ' if i ever see you , i will kill you			0
' i 'd had people yell at me before , but i 'd never had a death threat			0
" @entity182 , 42 , a @entity184 , @entity185 , customer care rep , says customers scream , cuss and even cry			1
but the calls that really get on her nerves are the ones from " the freaks			0
" " there 's one guy who calls and just says ' you f -- ing b --- ch ' in this weird low tone and then hangs up			0
he 's called a couple of times , " she says			0
" and then there 's another guy who calls in regularly and says he wants to discuss his bill , but then says ' i want you to tell me to write with a pink pen			0
and i want you to say , ' do it now ! ' " the golden touch most people who contact customer service sincerely need help , and companies would do well to listen to them , says @entity40 , who 's worked in the industry for 15 years			1
" customer service is going to be the new differentiator , " she says			1
" @entity216 is n't the deciding factor anymore -- it 's service			1
" that 's certainly what worked for @entity1 , who says her most recent customer service experience , in which an @entity223 rep took 10 minutes to help her track a pair of hard - to - find clogs for her husband , was " positively amazing			1
" " i 'd normally think someone would just want to take the order and get off the phone , but he was really cooperative and patient and very friendly , " she says			0
" i felt like i should send the company a thank - you note			0
it definitely left me with a positive feeling			0
