@entity0 -- the @entity2 is scheduled to tackle some key cases in its 2014 - 15 term , which starts monday			1
more than three dozen appeals are currently on the docket			2
perhaps three dozen more are expected to be added in coming months			2
the caseload for the term is usually settled by february , with the term effectively ending in late june			1
other important appeals that may yet be added cover such issues as same - sex marriage , affirmative action , abortion rights and further litigation over president @entity18 's health care reform law			1
cases already on the @entity2 docket : free speech : @entity22 v. @entity23 at issue : the limits of policing " speech crimes " in the internet age , especially laws aimed at protecting those harassed or bullied online			1
what is the level of proof needed to convict someone of making criminal threats ? the case : @entity22 was convicted in federal court for threatening language in @entity40 posts aimed at his estranged wife , judges and law enforcement			1
some were expressed as rap lyrics , which @entity22 said were " therapeutic " for dealing with emotional pain			2
but prosecutors said he crossed a dangerous free speech line			2
the arguments : @entity22 ' lawyers argue that the government did not prove that his statements showed a " subjective intent to threaten , " based on @entity2 precedent			0
but the @entity57 replied that his online comments were serious in nature , not a case of " careless talk , exaggeration , something said in a joking manner or an outburst of transitory anger			0
" the impact : a ruling here could have broader implications for free speech amid the explosion of popular and often anonymous social media			0
are sites like @entity75 in the same category as more conventional news links , and are general threats made online different from those made in person ? @entity81 : @entity82 v. @entity83 at issue : an inmate wants to grow a Â½ - inch beard in accordance with his beliefs , citing rights under the federal @entity90			1
the case : @entity82 , also known as @entity92 , is a muslim who filed a handwritten petition with the court			1
@entity98 prison policy allows only a " neatly trimmed mustache			0
" the arguments : corrections officials say beards can hide contraband and make it hard to identify prisoners , so such security concerns deserve deference from courts			1
but @entity82 's lawyers -- backed by the @entity18 administration -- say that a less restrictive policy should be adopted			1
the impact : @entity82 has the support of both civil liberties and religious freedom groups , who have often been traditional foes			0
last term , the justices ruled that some for - profit companies whose owners expressed strong @entity123 beliefs had a @entity125 right to oppose @entity127 health mandates providing contraception coverage for their workers			1
@entity130 : @entity131 v. @entity132 at issue : the constitutionality of a federal statute that explicitly directs the secretary of state how to record the birthplace of an @entity23 citizen on a @entity139 and on a passport			1
does the law impermissibly infringe on the president 's power to recognize a foreign nation ? the case : thirteen - year - old @entity131 is a @entity23 citizen , and his parents want his birthplace listed as " @entity148 , @entity149 , " but @entity23 diplomatic officials said they could use only " @entity148			1
" the status of the holy city remains in dispute , and @entity23 policy is reflected in the fact that it does not currently recognize any country as having sovereignty over the region			0
the arguments : the justices three years ago allowed the lawsuit by the family to proceed			0
it is not the first time @entity165 and the @entity166 have clashed over the holy city , which both @entity149 and @entity168 consider their capital : the @entity23 embassy remains in @entity171 , over @entity23 lawmakers ' objections			0
the impact : this dispute may be fact - specific , but the federal government is thinking of the bigger political and diplomatic picture			2
@entity179 officials would not comment on the record in a pending case , but president @entity18 has acknowledged that the stalled peace process has created divisions in that region and in the @entity23			0
workplace discrimination : @entity187 v. @entity188 at issue : the duty of employers to provide workplace accommodations under the federal @entity193			1
the case : expectant mother @entity196 's request for a " light duty " assignment from her regular work as a truck driver was denied , even though the company allegedly had done so for other workers temporarily unable to perform their functions			2
@entity187 , who worked in suburban @entity0 , then had to take unpaid leave , with a subsequent loss of medical benefits			0
the arguments : the company and @entity187 focus on two different readings of the act and whether @entity188 ' " pregnancy - blind " policy on the ability to work protects it from liability			1
the impact : the ruling could add significantly to the evolving canon of judicial oversight over job discrimination claims			0
cases that may be added to the @entity2 docket in coming months : @entity221 : various pending appeals from state officials in @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 at issue : whether state bans on the ability of gays and lesbians to legally wed violate the @entity235 's equal protection guarantees			1
the case : thirty - one states do not allow same - sex marriage			1
legal , political and social momentum favoring the right has accelerated in the past year after the @entity2 in a peripheral case struck down part of a congressional law that recognized marriage for federal purposes as between only one man and one woman			2
the arguments : gay rights groups say the bans are discriminatory and single out homosexuals for disparate treatment			0
but many states say that the voters -- not the courts -- should decide such matters and that traditional marriage encourages opposite - sex couples to raise children in a stable family unit			1
the impact : a final ruling from the @entity23 @entity2 would be a landmark on many social levels			0
the justices could historically alter how marriage is treated under a legal framework , potentially striking down every current same - sex marriage ban			1
or they could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place , allowing state legislatures to sort it all out , for now			0
abortion rights : @entity275 v. @entity276 at issue : a challenge to a @entity280 law that requires doctors to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of a clinic where they are providing abortion services			2
the case : other states have adopted similar laws , and lower courts have issued conflicting rulings			0
the arguments : abortion - rights supporters say the provision is unconstitutionally restrictive and has forced more than a third of centers that had provided abortions in @entity280 to close			2
state officials , including gov. @entity299 , have said the law ensures that clinics are no operating under " dangerous conditions			0
" the impact : another part of the @entity280 law is also being reviewed by a federal appeals court : the requirement that abortions be provided in only walk - in hospital - type surgical centers , which could force closure of many smaller women 's health clinics			1
11 other states have similar restrictions			0
if the case is accepted for review , the justices will again tackle one of the most contentious social issues			0
@entity319 : @entity320 at issue : a renewed challenge to the school 's race - conscious admissions policies			1
the case : @entity327 individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she a high senior in @entity330 , @entity280			0
@entity327 claims that she was turned away because she is white			0
the school defends its policy of considering race as one of many factors -- such as test scores , community service , leadership and work experience -- designed to create a diverse campus			0
the arguments : the high court first heard this case two years ago , issuing a ruling with no clear winner			1
the justices affirmed the limited use of race in the admissions process but made it somewhat harder for institutions to apply such policies to achieve diversity			0
the case went back to a federal appeals court for further scrutiny , which decided in the school 's favor in july			1
the impact : the @entity327 dispute will now probably be reviewed once again by the @entity2 in coming months , with the potential for a definitive 21st - century ruling			2
the issue of race and education offers vexing questions of competition , fairness and demographics -- and what role government should play when promoting political and social diversity .			2

the court will hear cases involving rappers , @entity188 drivers and @entity379 prisoners with beards
it is not yet clear if they will take up the *hot* button issue of same sex marriage
the court 's 2014 - 2015 term gets underway monday
