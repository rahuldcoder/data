tea , that most ordinary of beverages , was once so highly prized that traders , travelers and seafarers risked their lives to bring the precious cargo from @entity7 to the rest of the world			1
now , a small but growing band of tea aficionados is traveling across the country in pursuit of tea at its source , fueled by an appreciation of @entity7 's ancient tea culture and traditions and a more modern interest in green methods of cultivation and artisanal production			1
tea tourism within @entity7 is still a relatively new phenomenon , gaining traction in the last few years and generally associated with an educated and upwardly mobile @entity7 middle class			1
for @entity7 people , traveling for tea brings with it a certain cachet			1
" in most public schools , there is no formal education about tea , so one 's knowledge of the subject proves you have traveled , and studied about tea on your own , " says tea guide @entity31			2
" in others ' eyes , you are not only educated but cultivated			0
" ' understanding begins with a single cup ' tea expert and guide @entity46 specializes in bringing @entity7 tea culture to foreign travelers and expats within @entity7 -- a small portion of her clientele are @entity7 people who appreciate her depth of knowledge			1
@entity46 began arranging tea tours more than five years ago when she realized there was a growing interest in learning not just about the tea itself , but the culture surrounding it			2
" @entity63 are overwhelmed and undereducated about @entity7 tea culture , " she says			1
" many are n't aware of the benefits of loose - leaf teas and are mainly drinking teas blended with fruits and flowers			0
it takes a lifetime to appreciate tea , but understanding begins with just a single cup			0
" @entity7 tea tourists tend to have a different focus than westerners when it comes to visiting a tea area			1
@entity31 says @entity81 look for a sense of adventure and do n't mind hiking into the tea terraces			0
they have a strong interest in seeing production methods firsthand and picking tea for themselves , but do n't yet understand the culture of tea			0
" foreigners have difficulty understanding the delicate taste of xian ( savory ) and huigan ( sweetness ) in tea , " @entity31 says			0
@entity7 visitors , on the other hand , place an emphasis on relaxing and drinking tea without the need to hike into the tea plantation or pick leaves			1
they often use artisanal teas as gifts for building good business relationships and are interested in learning gongfu tea -- a refined way of serving tea involving proper vessels , brewing techniques and atmosphere that takes patience and skill to master			2
like good wine , tea 's final flavor is influenced heavily by terroir -- the microclimate in which it 's grown			1
for those interested in taking a tea tour , below are three starting points , corresponding to three of @entity7 's most well known teas , each different in climate , geography and taste			1
@entity131 ( @entity132 ) green tea located just south of @entity136 province 's beautiful @entity134 , @entity131 is home to @entity7 's most celebrated green tea , which is the color of jade and has the fresh aroma of chestnuts and cut grass			1
the best time to visit the area is during @entity7 's @entity145 ( usually april ) when most picking and roasting take place			1
@entity131 's tea villages and plantations -- many are open to the public -- are connected by a cycle pathway and bus route			1
longjing is home to the @entity157			0
among the temples , pagodas and gardens lining the shores of nearby @entity134 sit many small tea houses where longjing tea can be enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere			0
@entity136 is reached by high - speed train from @entity167 's @entity166			0
trains run every 30 minutes and take one hour			0
@entity46 and @entity31 arrange small group tea tours to the longjing tea terraces year round ( @entity171 ; +86 159 009 03998 )			0
@entity157 , 88 @entity172 , @entity134 , @entity136 ; +86 571 8796 4221 ; open 9 a.m. -5 p.m. , may - october 7 ; 8:30 a.m. -4:30 p.m. , october 8 - april 30 ; closed mondays ; free admission @entity175 oolong tea oolong tea , a fragrant partially oxidized tea midway between green teas like longjing and black teas like pu'er , has its origins in southern @entity7 's @entity183 province			1
the most famous of @entity183 's oolongs , da hong pao or " big red robe " tea comes from @entity175 , a @entity189 - protected natural heritage site rich with rare and animal life , centered around the pristine @entity191			1
genuine da hong pao is picked from just a few ancient tea trees high on @entity175 and is unobtainable to all but the wealthiest and most influential , but oolong plantations in the surrounding hills produce wonderful teas too			2
like wine , the terroir of these teas is demonstrated by oolong 's floral notes , which are subtly different according to the orientation , altitude and soil mineral content of the hillside on which the tea is grown			1
nearby is the well preserved medieval tea - trading town of @entity208 and further afield are @entity183 's famed tulou -- ancient rammed earth roundhouses that hold up to 400 families inside			2
@entity213 has its own airport with daily flights to and from major @entity7 cities			0
@entity217 runs three - day @entity175 and oolong tea tours year round			2
@entity219 ; daily from 7:30 a.m. ; admission rmb 235 ( $ 38 ) for a two - day pass @entity222 's pu'er tea @entity223 , a fermented and aged black tea with a complex , earthy taste , is considered the pinnacle of all @entity7 teas			1
usually pressed into cakes , it 's allowed to age so that its complexity and depth of flavor increase over time ( as does the price ) , again drawing comparisons to wine			2
@entity223 has a fascinating trade history			0
tea was carried , often on foot , overland on the ancient @entity240 linking @entity222 and @entity241 in exchange for the @entity244 mountain ponies sought by the @entity7 for their hardiness			2
the area of southern @entity222 where pu'er is produced lies adjacent to @entity248 , @entity249 and the @entity250			0
the region features an enormous protected native jungle and wild elephant reserve , a tropical and medicinal botanic garden , hills terraced with tea plantations and areas filled with wild tea trees that are hundreds of years old			0
there are daily flights to the regional capital , @entity262 , from all major @entity7 cities , or you can fly directly into the smaller @entity265 ( known as @entity266 )			0
@entity223 tea tours can be arranged through @entity262 's @entity268			0
@entity269 and @entity270 is 48 kilometers north of @entity262 ; daily , 8 a.m. -5:30 p.m. @entity271 in @entity272 is located 70 kilometers east of @entity262 ; daily , 7 a.m. - midnight			0
