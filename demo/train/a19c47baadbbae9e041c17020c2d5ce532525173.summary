@entity0 , @entity1 along the @entity3 , an abundance of vivid purple flowers are blooming gently on the surface of the water , adding a touch of color to the inland waterways			1
but that 's where the beauty ends because these striking flowers are water hyacinths -- an aquatic weed wreaking havoc in local communities and ruining water supplies			2
not only does this fast - growing water pest curtail access to waterways and cause problems for local fishermen , it also depletes nutrients from the water , which in turn reduces fish populations			1
but where many see an invasive aquatic nuisance , @entity1 entrepreneur @entity29 identified a business opportunity			1
setting up shop in @entity0 , a city in the south - west region of @entity1 , she began harvesting the water hyacinth and transforming the waste product into intricately handcrafted everyday items			1
" what we do is take an environmental problem and turn it into a win - win solution , " @entity29 explains			1
the 46 - year - old entrepreneur has always had a passion for sustainable development			0
over the years she has consulted on various environmental projects relating to waste recovery			2
but turning these watery weeds into a tangible , bespoke craft was the first idea to really catch her entrepreneurial eye			0
splitting her time between @entity1 and the @entity51 -- where she was born -- she finally returned from the diaspora in 2009 and three years later founded @entity54			1
in 2013 , the company was awarded a grant from the @entity57 allowing the small startup to grow and take seven full - time staff on board as well as provide work opportunities to local artisans during busy periods			0
making each craft depends on the climate and having enough hands to work			0
the weeds are harvested from a myriad of local water channels and laid out in the sun to dry out , which can take anywhere from four days to two weeks in the rainy season			2
once dry , they are then processed into the rope required to weave products together			0
in addition to creating beautiful woven handicrafts , @entity29 wanted to offer local communities skills and potential business ideas			1
along with the @entity54 team , she has branched out into eight communities , mainly in the @entity3 , training and educating residents on how to take this watery menace and transform it into rope for weaving products			0
" we help them to see the invasive weed through a different lens in terms of this could actually become a source of livelihood , " she says			0
" we go in and train them on how to harvest the material from the waterways , we tell them how they are supposed to dry it and then we teach them how to weave the water hyacinth			1
we also demonstrate the type of products that they could make			0
" after we assist them with basic training , the rest is left up to their own creativity and we see them use the skills they have acquired to turn them into products that we 've never even mentioned			0
" so far , @entity116 has been marketing her products online to a largely @entity1 customer base while also selling through third party retail outlets in @entity122			2
but the businesswoman wants to take her startup further in 2015			0
" we want to see ourselves as the number one maker of eco-friendly handicrafts -- that are telling this very unique story about how we have transformed @entity1 's problem of water hyacinth into a beneficial solution			1
" she adds : " and to build on that ( to ) become one of the major non-oil sector exporters of products from @entity1			2

@entity29 returned to @entity1 in 2009 hoping to start a business
always *interested* in the environment , @entity29 noticed an abundance of water hyacinth
it is a fresh water weed known for *clogging* waterways , lowering fish populations
she *decided* to take the environmental pest and turn it into beautiful handcrafts
