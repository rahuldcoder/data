-- @entity2 's prestigious @entity1 has increased its prize money to a record $ 7.5 million , in an effort to attract the top race horses from around the world			1
the country 's premier five - day racing festival -- home to @entity12 's namesake race , the @entity13 -- has boosted its prize money by a whopping $ 756,750 on last year			1
the world - renowned meeting , which attracts a " who 's who " list of royal and celebrity guests , will now also honor prince @entity16 with a race named after him			2
but despite the prestige associated with @entity1 , its prize money still lags behind the rest of the world			1
the richest horse racing event on the planet , the @entity26 , kicks off later this month with a total prize pool of $ 27 million , for nine group races			1
similarly , the @entity33 @entity32 races offer combined prize money of $ 25 million , while @entity36 's @entity35 has a purse of $ 12.6 million			2
" we have seen some remarkable racing at @entity1 in recent years and whilst the importance of winning at @entity1 both in terms of prestige and in value to the bloodstock industry ca n't be denied , increasing prize money is equally crucial to attracting the best horses to run in a highly competitive market , " @entity1 chief executive @entity38 said			1
" it is very important to us to have a significant minimum amount on offer , and we have set that at Â £ 60,000 ( $ 90,700 )			0
" it may not offer the same cash as other international competitions , but @entity1 last year attracted the top four rated race horses in the world -- @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			0
retired @entity2 champion @entity58 , who won 14 races on the trot , chose @entity1 's @entity64 to make his final appearance , drawing a sellout crowd of 32,000			2
@entity68 super mare @entity60 , who remains unbeaten in a remarkable 23 consecutive races , made her @entity1 debut with a nailbiting win in the @entity13			0
that flagship race remains capped at $ 756,750 -- compared to $ 10 million for @entity76 's premier @entity26 race -- but prize purses for the @entity79 stakes and @entity80 will rise from $ 378,000 to $ 530,000 each			2
the total prize money on offer at @entity1 throughout 2013 is now just over $ 20 million			1
this year @entity12 's grandson @entity16 , who is expecting his first child with wife @entity86 , the @entity83 , will have extra reason to celebrate after the @entity88 was renamed the @entity88 in his honor			0
pomp and pageantry define the historic track , with the royal family arriving each june in a lavish horse - drawn carriage			0
so highly regarded is tradition and decorum at @entity1 , that last year organizers even had dress code administrators on hand to assess the thousands of people who descend on the @entity102 venue -- with a strict list of dos and don'ts issued to prevent standards slipping			0
the @entity107 , where her majesty watches all five days of the meeting , is where the most stringent regulations are enforced -- including a ban on the widely popular fascinator headpieces .			0
