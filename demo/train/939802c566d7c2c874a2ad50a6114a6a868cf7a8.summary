it is sheer panic in the woman 's voice on the cell phone video as the flames shot out of the windows of the wood frame home : " there 's a man in there ! " the next sound on the video is a loud explosion , likely the propane tank of a barbeque grill			1
" we got ta get the dad , " screams the woman			2
the explosion forced two men who were trying to reach the trapped man away from the home			1
seconds later , a man in a blue @entity25 cap jogs out with a 73 - year - old man slung over his shoulder			2
" oh thank @entity33 ! " says the woman who is recording the video , her relief as striking as her fear just seconds earlier			1
the elderly man is stunned as the man in the blue cap lowers him			2
he 's wearing tubes that appear to help him breathe			2
we later learn he was attached to an oxygen tank , highly explosive in a house fire			2
on the video , you can see other people on the street run up to assist him			1
what you do n't see is the moment the man in the blue cap disappears , vanishing before firefighters arrive or anyone gets his name			1
" i did n't see him , " says @entity50 , the woman who recorded the dramatic weekend fire and rescue on her cell phone			1
" he went on his way , just disappeared			2
" @entity50 , as she reviewed her video , saw something even more extraordinary			1
in the seconds before the explosion of the propane tank , you can see the man in the blue cap calmly walk towards the burning home , flames nearing 20 feet high			1
the explosion that forced others away from the house did n't stop the man in the blue cap			1
" he calmly walks in there , calmly			2
then here he comes , carrying the dad , " recalls @entity50			2
for 48 hours , the @entity72 fire department and local reporters hunted for the mysterious hero , flashing his image all over area news outlets			1
who was he ? why would he dive into a burning home , save a man and then not stay long enough for even a simple " thank you " ? " there 's over half a million people in @entity72 and this guy 's picture is all over the news and nobody could find him , " says @entity72 fire department spokesman @entity81			1
while the fire department urges people to not dive into the middle of a fire for their own safety , @entity81 ca n't help but be impressed by seeing ordinary people at their best			1
" for a civilian to do that , it 's truly remarkable			2
there are some people , wired in such a way that when that moment presents itself , they do n't think about self - preservation			1
that 's what makes them heroes			2
" several men appeared to help the elderly man , all of whom came forward in the first 24 hours			2
but the mystery lingered ... who was the man in the blue @entity25 cap ? perhaps the man who wanted to know most was @entity117 , the 73 - year - old man who was carried to safety on the man 's back			2
" he snatched me up and away we went			0
bouncing on his back , hands like this , wow			0
that was one helluva ride			0
" i met @entity117 at the @entity127 , the day before he and his were going to have to leave			0
out of money and distraught about where to go , @entity117 , his daughter and granddaughter said the fire destroyed everything they owned			0
@entity117 has only about 25 % lung capacity , as the result of copd and emphysema			0
but @entity117 was quick to point out he did n't lose his life , thanks to a heroic act of a man he 'd never met			1
what he hoped for most was to say thank you to the mystery man			0
" he 's gon na be on my mind the rest of my life , " says @entity117			0
it appeared the man would never be found , that this might become @entity72 folklore			0
but in this age , social media has a way of making sure all secrets are uncovered			0
it 's a little unclear exactly how it happened , but a @entity161 post from a relative of the man in the blue cap mentioned he knew the hero			1
@entity167 groaned as the reporters starting banging on his door			1
" i did n't want the glory , " he says sheepishly , wearing the same blue @entity25 cap he had on as he walked calmly towards @entity117 ' burning home			1
" i do n't want it			1
" @entity173 can barely look at me as i prod him , so uncomfortable is he talking about himself			0
@entity173 says he was driving by when he saw the fire and heard the screaming about the trapped man inside			0
he parked his white truck and walked slowly towards the fire			0
the 49 - year - old devoted husband , father of three and grandfather of five did n't think about what he had to lose			1
a man who spends his free time helping out elderly people in his neighborhood with their gardens naturally thought about what he could do to help			0
" that 's when the explosion went , " he says			0
" i just ducked , and seen the old man in the yard			0
he was on that machine			0
" @entity173 , whose stocky and muscular frame still reflects his younger years as an athlete , knew he could easily carry the elderly man out			0
" i put him on my shoulder			0
" as @entity173 lowered @entity117 from his shoulder , he saw @entity50 recording the rescue on her cell phone			1
in the same way his instinct was to walk towards @entity117 , @entity173 decided to walk away			0
@entity173 saw his picture in the paper and the video on the local news			1
he could n't escape the video that was flying across @entity161 and @entity216			1
he hoped his wife would n't find out because he did n't tell her			1
he hoped the story would fade and he could go back to his job as a delivery man for a liquor company , without anyone connecting the video to him			1
" why , " i ask			0
" most of us liked to be thanked			0
" @entity173 's eyes begin to fill with emotion			0
" we have to help each other out			0
we got ta help each other out			0
i do n't feel like a hero			1
if it was someone else , i 'd help them , too			0
