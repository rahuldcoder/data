that 's how a family shows its power , " declares @entity2 as @entity3 in " @entity4 " to the bemused descendants gathered around the dinner table			1
in his day -- the 1700s -- throwing a party was a political act			2
but 200 years later -- in 1972 , to be exact -- balls are out of style			2
women 's lib is in the air , and his movie is loaded with powerful , independent women			2
the hippies are dropping out			0
and vampires are an anachronism			0
i better admit from the start i never saw @entity27 ' spooky " @entity4 " soap opera , a curio that ran from 1966 to 1971			1
the belated blockbuster edition arrives courtesy of director @entity31 , star @entity2 and " @entity34 " scribe @entity32 , a mash - up monster squad possibly more inclined to camp than @entity27 was , and certainly more tickled by the nostalgic " modernity " of the @entity37 era			1
the fruit of their labors is mostly weirdly amusing -- when it 's not just plain bemusing -- but hardly the wacky parody the trailers suggest			0
and it falls well short of satire			0
the gags are there alright , but so is the soap in roughly equal measure			2
always stronger on gothic atmosphere than story , @entity31 dedicates unwarranted screentime to the @entity3 ' dull fortunes in the fish canning business ( i 'm not kidding )			1
more promisingly , he dishes up tortured romance more or less straight -- or as straight as a romantic triangle between an angry witch , a lovelorn vampire and a corpse is ever likely to be -- and smuggles at least a smidgeon of heartfelt emotional baggage into the spectacularly dysfunctional dynamics of the @entity3 clan			1
as we know by now , in @entity31 's films being a misfit is a mark of distinction			1
and if @entity2 's @entity3 is by his own admission an accursed monster with buckets of blood on his hands , he 's more or less absolved of moral guilt , redeemed by his loyalty , integrity and commitment to the family			1
on top of which , @entity2 is fun			2
he 's a vision in monochrome with his pasty complexion , black cape and hair			1
his elongated fingers weave mesmerizing dainty webs in thin air , and he pounces on each and every syllable of ripe 18th century rhetoric for maximum pomp			0
but scratch the surface and this turns out to be another arch , hollow turn from an actor who seems to treat his roles like extended party pieces , sniffing out any excuse for vaudeville and hang the consequences			0
his @entity3 is the life of the party but impossible to take seriously as a tormented soul			2
despite his protestations , there is precious little heat between him and his beloved , @entity112 ( an intriguingly wan @entity113 )			0
if you ca n't join him , beat him : that seems to be @entity117 's game , effectively out - vamping @entity2 as @entity3 ' spurned lover and nemesis , brittle , randy sorceress @entity121			1
also preening for attention but given rather less to play is @entity123 -- who must have thought she was back in @entity124 -- as @entity125 , the de facto head of the family , @entity125 as dypso head - doctor @entity127 and @entity128 as @entity125 's very adolescent daughter @entity129			0
then there is @entity131 as plain old @entity131			0
they 're all troupers , but step back a moment , you might feel a bit queasy about a picture that shrugs off multiple murders and vilifies an abused housemaid who rebels against the old @entity142 social hierarchies			0
unfortunately , @entity31 and @entity2 's ironic , detached treatment invites just that kind of idle reflection			1
the architecture looks grand , but the foundations are shaky .			0

" @entity4 " is based on @entity27 ' spooky soap opera of the same name
@entity2 is a vision in monochrome with his pasty complexion , black hair and cape
@entity31 dedicates unwarranted time to the @entity3 ' dull fortunes in the fish canning business
