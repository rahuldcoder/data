@entity0 , @entity1 -- ousted @entity0 mayor @entity3 presided over a " pyramid " of corruption in the @entity1 capital that the @entity7 tolerated for political advantage , according to a document released by the website @entity10 on wednesday			1
despite an anti-corruption campaign launched by @entity1 president @entity18 , " the extent of corruption in @entity0 remains pervasive with mayor @entity3 at the top of the pyramid , " according to a february cable from the @entity21 embassy there			1
" @entity3 oversees a system in which it appears that almost everyone at every level is involved in some form of corruption or criminal behavior			2
" but for @entity18 and prime minister @entity29 , @entity3 remained " a trusted deliverer of votes and influence " for their ruling party , @entity30			1
" @entity29 and @entity18 's dilemma is deciding when @entity3 becomes a bigger liability than asset , " the cable states			1
@entity3 apparently reached that point in september , when @entity18 abruptly fired the 74 - year - old @entity0 mayor			2
his dismissal came after criticism in @entity1 's state media that he had gone on vacation during a wave of forest fires that blanketed the capital in thick smog -- and after reports that he channeled funds and lucrative deals to his property - developer wife , now @entity1 's richest woman			2
@entity3 denied the allegations after his dismissal and told @entity2 that he was fired to enable the @entity7 to tighten its grip on power			0
he won a libel suit against an opposition leader who leveled allegations of corruption against the mayor , though the @entity21 embassy cable notes the judgment was issued on technical grounds			0
the @entity21 document , dated more than seven months before @entity3 's dismissal , described a three - tiered " kleptocracy			1
" " criminal elements enjoy a ' krysha ' ( a term from the criminal / mafia world literally meaning ' roof ' or protection ) that runs through the police , the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) , @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , and the prosecutor 's office , as well as throughout the @entity0 city government bureaucracy , " the document states			1
it added , " @entity3 is at the top			0
" " @entity0 business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the @entity77 and @entity76 ( rather than organized crime groups ) since they not only have more guns , resources , and power than criminal groups , but they are also protected by the law , " the cable continued			0
" for this reason , protection from criminal gangs is no longer so high in demand			0
police and @entity77 collect money from small businesses while the @entity76 collects from big businesses			0
" in addition , according to one source quoted in the document , @entity3 and other regional leaders were kicking payments up to the @entity7			2
" the governors collect money based on bribes , almost resembling a tax system , throughout their regions , " the cable quotes that source , whose name was redacted .			0

a @entity21 @entity117 document describes @entity0 as a " kleptocracy "
@entity3 was a political asset for @entity1 's ruling party
businesses prefer paying off cops over *gangsters* , the document states
