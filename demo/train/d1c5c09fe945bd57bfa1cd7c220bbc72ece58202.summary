@entity2 and @entity3 's players wore t - shirts in support of the @entity54 , who maintained his innocence , but the club were forced to apologize when the striker refused to shake @entity48 's hand before @entity3 's game at @entity61 in february			1
the @entity63 's relationship with the media became increasingly fractious and he walked out of several post-match interviews towards the end of the season			2
@entity3 narrowly failed to secure a cup double earlier this month , losing 2 - 1 in the @entity70 final at @entity71 by @entity72 , and then lost the final game of the season at @entity75			1
despite his sacking , @entity2 said it had been an " honor and a privilege " to manage the club again			1

i said when first approached about coming back as manager that i would always be of help if i can at any time and that offer remains the same			0

he was appointed manager for the second time when the club removed @entity135 , now the @entity6 manager , in january 2011			2
@entity2 oversaw an sharp upturn in fortunes as he led @entity3 away from the lower reaches of the @entity24 , eventually finishing sixth , having spent big on striker @entity139 in january			1
several more players arrived in expensive deals over the summer but have failed to make their mark at @entity143			0
winger @entity144 , signed for a reported $ 31 million , failed to score or provide an assist in 36 @entity24 games -- but has still been named in @entity6 's squad for @entity148			0
