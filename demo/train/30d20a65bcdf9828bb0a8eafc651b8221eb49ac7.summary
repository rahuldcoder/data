-- right now , two - thirds of @entity2 are suffering from " @entity3 , " according to a new @entity5 poll			1
it 's a hyper - contagious disease that affects the brain , making sufferers fear a widespread @entity10 outbreak in the @entity2			1
fear - bola is an airborne disease that spreads through conversation , entering your brain through your ears			1
fear - bola is so contagious that some victims have contracted it by simply seeing images and videos about @entity10			1
once inside your body , @entity22 - bola attacks the part of the brain responsible for rational thinking			1
it starts with a low - grade concern about the two health care workers diagnosed with @entity10 in @entity30 and slowly builds into fear of a widespread epidemic in the @entity2			1
almost half of the people affected by @entity3 are also " very " or " somewhat " worried they themselves will catch the virus			0
fear - bola is dangerous because it leads to confused decision - making and illusions			1
people who favor travel bans , for example , suffer from fear - bola			1
anyone convinced @entity10 is an airborne virus is suffering from the disease			2
if the news that a second health care worker in @entity30 diagnosed with @entity10 made you think you 're in a real - life " contagion " or " outbreak " movie , you suffer from fear - bola			1
fear - bola can also affect institutions			1
@entity56 , a small community college outside @entity30 , has contracted fear - bola and has stopped accepting students from countries with confirmed cases of @entity10 , according to @entity61			1
@entity62 has rejected every student application from @entity64 , a country with 174 million people and 20 cases of @entity10			2
by the way , after " world - class epidemiological detective work , " that outbreak was traced back to a @entity70 - @entity2			2
@entity64 is five days away from being declared @entity10 - free by the @entity71			2
to put this story in perspective , it would be like @entity75 suddenly sending rejection letters to every high school applicant from @entity78 , stating : " unfortunately @entity75 is not accepting applications from students in states with confirmed cases of @entity10			2
" as you can see , @entity22 - bola is extremely dangerous at an institutional level because it leads to widespread discrimination			1
i almost caught fear - bola from a good friend when he told me : " you better believe i 'm worried about @entity10			1
sure , the docs say , ' do n't worry			0
you must touch fluid to get it ' ... but what if a person on plane or subway sneezes , sending fluid particles at me or a few drops on the seat			0
... that 's not airborne to docs ... but that 's fluid and now i have @entity10			2
yeah , i 'm very afraid			0
" that was all it took to contract fear - bola			1
suddenly , i felt the urge to @entity106 " how far does a sneeze travel ? " ( it 's 200 feet , by the way			0
) once you contract @entity3 , you ca n't help but spread it to others			0
after talking to my friend , i called my mom -- who luckily gave me a dose of common sense			0
as she put it , " i do n't know what everyone is so worried about @entity10			2
if you 're in @entity119 , yes , you should be afraid , but here ? it 's ridiculous			2
" one person has died in the @entity2 from @entity10 and that 's awful			1
but if you want to worry about a contagious disease that can kill you , worry about the flu			0
did you know tens of thousands of people died from the flu last year , tens of thousands ? i do n't see people stampeding to @entity130 to get a flu shot			1
according to the @entity134 , from 1997 to 2007 , flu deaths ranged from a low of about 3,500 to a high of 49,000 deaths a year			2
the flu reached epidemic levels in last year 's season			2
and just like that i was cured of @entity3 with a dose of the facts			0
unless you are a health care worker or family member caring for an infected patient , you are not going to contract @entity10 in the @entity2			1
you have nothing to fear			0
we can not allow @entity3 to take over @entity2 because the world needs our help			0
we need to think rationally , and we need to think globally			0
in @entity119 , the facts are grim -- more than 4,000 dead , and the outbreak is doubling in size every three weeks			0
the @entity71 says @entity119 could see 10,000 new @entity10 cases a week by december			1
it 's spreading quickly in @entity119 because the affected countries are politically unstable and recovering from war , and they lack the public health infrastructure to quarantine people properly , provide health workers with protective gear and educate the population about risks and best practices			0
we 're right to be concerned about the welfare of the medical professionals who were treating @entity167 , who died from @entity10 in @entity30			2
but an outbreak is not likely			0
our public health and communication infrastructures are yet another reason why there will never be a major @entity10 outbreak here			0
the spread of @entity10 overseas has more to do with the social and political realities in @entity119 than the reality of the virus			1
it is vital to mobilize our health care experts and nongovernmental organizations overseas quickly			0
the best way to prevent @entity10 in the @entity2 is to protect people in @entity119			1
here , two people are infected with @entity10 in @entity30 ; in @entity119 , more than 8,000 are infected			1
the fewer people who get it in @entity119 , the less likely it will spread here			0
it 's counterintuitive , but a travel ban driven by fear - bola would actually spread @entity10 , as this article in @entity190 explains			1
a travel ban would also seal us off when invaluable resources from the @entity134 and the @entity194 need to be deployed to help stop the spread of @entity10 on a global scale			0
if a ship is sinking , what good does it do to lock ourselves below deck in our cabins ? in 2002 , we were invaluable in fighting @entity201 and in 2009 , working with @entity202 to curb the swine flu outbreak			0
if you live in @entity119 , you have reason to be afraid			0
if you care for @entity10 patients , you must be extraordinary careful			0
if you have been placed in quarantine , you better remain there until you are cleared			0
for the rest of us here in the @entity2 , it 's time to eradicate @entity3 and focus on how you can help those who are suffering from the @entity10 outbreak overseas			1
and while you 're at it , you should probably get a flu shot .			0
