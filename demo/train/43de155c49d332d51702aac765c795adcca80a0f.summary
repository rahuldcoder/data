-- when the blind @entity3 dissident @entity2 staged his astonishing escape from house arrest , he sought @entity7 protection at the @entity8 in @entity9			1
six days later , when @entity2 left the embassy for a local hospital , it looked as if @entity7 officials had found a solution that , as the @entity17 put it , " reflected his choices and our values			1
" one official at the @entity7 @entity8 said @entity2 was so grateful for @entity7 's help that he told secretary of state @entity21 on the phone , " i would like to kiss you			1
" but the picture is starting to change , with signs emerging that the @entity27 administration failed to effectively protect @entity2			1
did the @entity7 betray the @entity3 human rights lawyer ? the @entity7 said a deal with @entity3 would set @entity2 free and allow him to relocate within the country along with his family and attend a university			1
but @entity2 has told @entity0 that the @entity7 government let him down			1
the @entity7 insists the activist left the diplomatic compound willingly and wanted to remain in @entity3			1
however , @entity2 said he fears for his life , his wife 's safety and wants to leave the country			2
more troubling , he claims that @entity7 officials , instead of extending their protection , pressured him to leave the safety of the embassy			2
if this is true , it is a dark mark of shame for the @entity7			0
until now , president @entity27 had a mixed record on human rights			1
this was an important test for an administration that has favored pragmatism over emotionally satisfying displays			0
@entity2 's unexpected request for shelter at the @entity7 @entity8 created a terrible dilemma for @entity57			1
months ago , @entity58 had already spoken on his behalf , as human rights groups characterized his detention as wholly illegal			1
but @entity2 's escape to the @entity7 @entity8 came at the worst possible moment , with @entity58 about to visit @entity9 for high level meetings on other crucial issues			1
@entity7 's relationship with @entity3 is complicated , to put it mildly			1
the @entity7 needs @entity9 's cooperation on @entity69 and @entity70			0
@entity3 is one of @entity7 's top trading partners and its top creditor			2
the @entity3 government does not take well to lectures on human rights , saying that they are a hypocritical construct of the @entity78 and are used for political purposes			1
even if the issue has merit , @entity9 says , it would be an internal matter ; none of @entity7 's business			0
@entity2 , who has been blind since childhood , is a self - taught lawyer			2
he became a fierce advocate for the poor and disabled and gained attention when he exposed abuses of @entity3 's one - child policy , uncovering the brutality of lower level officials who carried out forced abortions and sterilizations on thousands of poor @entity3 women			0
initially , @entity9 heard his case and even arrested some of the offenders			0
but @entity2 said @entity9 's actions amounted to very little			0
as his international profile rose and he redoubled his commitment to empower the people before the government , @entity3 authorities turned against him			0
in 2006 , the @entity3 government sent @entity2 to prison on charges that he disrupted traffic and damaged property , charges that he denies			2
after he left prison four years later , he and his family were placed under harsh house arrest			2
human rights groups say they endured daily beatings and a near - starvation diet			2
on april 29 , under cover of darkness , @entity2 climbed the wall that had been built around his house			2
his blindness meant the dark gave him an advantage over the scores of security personnel that kept watch over him			0
he had led his captors to believe he was ill , and they lowered their guard even more			0
once over the wall , a network of activists helped him , with one of them , @entity134 , driving him 300 miles to the @entity8 in @entity9			0
she is now under arrest			0
when president @entity27 was asked about @entity2 , he said he was aware of the situation but refused to address it , saying only , " every time we meet with @entity3 the issue of human rights comes up			1
" @entity27 disappointed human rights activists early in his administration when , for example , he resisted coming out strongly in support of pro-democracy activists in @entity69 , claiming it would not be helpful to " meddle " when hundreds of thousands took to the streets			1
he was criticized for canceling a meeting with the @entity152 , and after he finally met him , for having him leave through a back door to lower the profile of the meeting , in order to sooth @entity3			0
his continuing support for some dictatorships and tepid , inconsistent positions on the @entity161 uprisings have also spurred criticism			0
at the same time , his pragmatic diplomacy appears to have borne fruit , most notably in @entity165			0
and human rights activists say he has come a long way since his earlier stumbles			2
the @entity2 case , however , could become iconic			0
if the @entity27 administration can not explain what went wrong , it will have opened itself to criticism from human rights advocates and from @entity176 rivals , that he badly fumbled			1
the @entity3 government has demanded an apology from @entity57 for helping @entity2 and for interfering in @entity3 domestic affairs			2
but the @entity27 administration , which claimed it had stayed true to @entity7 values in the @entity2 case , needs to prove that it has the moral strength to stand up for one courageous individual who sought help			1
this is not just about @entity2			0
it is about universal principles of human rights , really , and about @entity7 's willingness to defend them on the global stage			1
the whole world is watching			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

blind @entity3 dissident @entity2 escaped from house arrest
@entity198 : he sought help from @entity7 embassy , but now it seems he is being *abandoned*
she says deal the @entity7 and @entity3 made over @entity2 appears to go counter to his wish
