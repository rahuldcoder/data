-- never judge a book by its cover -- and never judge a major sports event before it has begun			2
just ask @entity4 , @entity5 , which was rocked by some dismal headlines on safety and infrastructure ahead of the @entity9 before recovering to win praise from the head of the quadrennial event			2
still , with just under two days to go before the opening ceremony , preparations for the @entity14 are looking far from complete			1
from hotels that do n't appear to be finished , to ongoing security concerns , to reports of officials poisoning stray dogs -- none of this will be what @entity24 president @entity23 would have hoped to see when he arrived in @entity26 on tuesday			1
so , what are the biggest concerns ? four issues have been grabbing headlines this week for reasons that have nothing to do with the upcoming sporting activities			1
security the most important duty of any host nation is surely to ensure the safety of athletes and visitors , but simmering tensions in the nearby @entity42 region of the country -- where @entity45 separatists have conducted a string of deadly attacks -- have meant that the threat of terrorism has loomed large over @entity26			1
indeed , @entity50 , who has named himself emir of a self - proclaimed entity called the @entity53 , last year called on jihadists to do their " utmost to derail these satanic dances on the bones of our ancestors			2
" tens of thousands of police and troops have been dispatched to the area to create what @entity23 has described as a " ring of steel " protecting the games			0
but questions were raised about the ability to protect soft targets when @entity24 officials released photographs of three " black widows " -- young women whose husband purportedly were killed by @entity24 forces -- who allegedly were planning to bomb the olympic torch relay			1
there was particular concern about a fourth suspect , @entity80 , who officials said might be in the @entity26 area			1
on wednesday , @entity24 media announced that police in @entity85 had killed the alleged mastermind behind twin bomb attacks in the @entity24 city of @entity89 in december			1
the bombings killed 34 people and injured 100			0
those attacks , along with a pair of january incidents in the restive @entity42 republic of @entity85 -- a restaurant bombing that injured at least five people and a shootout that left three policemen and four militants dead -- underscored fears that terrorists might look to strike outside of @entity26 during the @entity103 , when all eyes will be on @entity24			0
" the @entity24 ' task is complicated by remote , forested and often mountainous territory in the @entity42 , as well as a devolved structure among jihadist groups , organized into autonomous military units known as jamaats , " noted @entity0 's @entity105			0
" terrorism analysts believe that some among the growing @entity115 diaspora in @entity116 may also be raising funds for the insurgents			0
" also wednesday , a law enforcement source told @entity0 that the @entity120 has advised airlines with direct flights to @entity24 to be aware of the possibility that explosive materials could be concealed in toothpaste or cosmetic tubes			1
the source emphasized that there was no known threat to the @entity120 , but the notice to @entity120 and international carriers is based on new intelligence information ahead of the start of the @entity134			1
@entity135 warned about possible toothpaste tube bombs ahead of @entity134 and on tuesday , @entity137 , director of the @entity120 @entity138 , warned that the @entity120 was tracking a number of " specific threats of varying degrees of credibility			1
" " [ @entity143 ] e 're working very closely with the @entity24 and with other partners to monitor any threats we see and to disrupt those , " @entity142 added			0
the @entity120 already has dispatched at least two warships off the coast of the @entity151 city in the event that an evacuation is necessary , while a number of athletes have reportedly asked relatives to skip attending the games			1
@entity120 apparently have noticed such concerns -- a @entity0 poll released wednesday showed that 57 % believed a terrorist attack on the @entity103 is likely			1
infrastructure if the security of athletes and spectators is the biggest issue for the organizers , then ensuring that facilities for both competitors and guests are up to scratch is surely the next concern			0
after all , athletes have been training for years for this event			0
for some it will be their only shot at @entity176 glory			0
is having somewhere comfortable to sleep , perhaps with a fresh glass of water by the bedside , too much to ask as you prepare for the biggest two weeks of your life ? in @entity26 , according to numerous accounts on social media this week , the answer might just be yes			1
@entity195 has been highlighting some of the early reactions to the accommodations on offer , and draws particular attention to the size of the beds ( @entity204 's men 's hockey team may have been hoping to have a bit more space ) , the bareness of the rooms ( reports of missing tvs , chairs and shower curtains ) and , perhaps most troubling of all , the sign one reporter snapped warning that toilet paper should not be flushed down the toilet			1
to cap it all , the @entity209 's @entity208 reportedly complained that she had been warned about the hazardous water in her hotel room , and a picture she tweeted , showing two glasses of yellowish liquid she said were from the hotel , went viral			1
competition conditions setting aside the accommodation issues , will athletes be safe when they start competing ? the withdrawal of @entity120 snowboarding star @entity220 from one of the events could be a troubling sign			0
@entity220 did n't give a specific reason for his withdrawal , but even if a mere wrist injury is the only reason , @entity26 organizers are said to have " faced fierce criticism over the layout at the @entity231 , with competitors claiming that it is too dangerous to host the event			2
" of course , one thing that the organizers have no control over is the weather , and after complaints about the lack of quality snow in @entity243 for the @entity244 , some had worried whether @entity26 's climate could provide enough of the white stuff			1
with such concerns in mind , @entity24 reportedly brought in state - of - the - art snowmaking equipment			2
but according to the @entity251 , this wo n't be necessary			0
" the weather for the upcoming week at all the @entity176 venues will be just wonderful , " the paper quoted the head of @entity24 's @entity254 as saying this week			2
" enough snow has fallen , the situation is completely relaxed			0
nature has given us everything we need			0
" warning to @entity120 athletes : no @entity176 uniforms outside @entity26 venues those stray dogs yet , while issues like infrastructure and security seem destined to be perennial concerns at major sporting events -- just look at the controversy surrounding @entity273 's efforts to prepare for this year 's @entity274 -- sometimes a story will appear out of the blue and make international headlines for all the wrong reasons			2
on wednesday , @entity0 correspondent @entity279 reported that @entity24 authorities have been rounding up and poisoning stray dogs in the city			2
" they always poison the street dogs here , " @entity279 quoted one @entity26 resident as saying			0
" but in december it got terrible ... they began poisoning the animals terribly before the @entity134			1
" @entity176 officials , though , have a different take			2
" all stray dogs that are found on the @entity293 are collected by a professional veterinary contractor for the well - being of the people on the @entity231 and the animals themselves , " the @entity291 said in a statement this week			0
" all healthy animals are released following their health check			0
" @entity26 's organizers will no doubt be relieved when the focus is on the competition and not the venue			0
at around 8 p.m. local time friday , perhaps they 'll get what they 're hoping for			0

new : among the terror concerns is explosives in toothpaste tubes on planes
preparations in the @entity134 host city are up against the wire
complaints about accommodations , water are getting media attention
one *bright* spot is the weather ; officials say snowfall has been ample
