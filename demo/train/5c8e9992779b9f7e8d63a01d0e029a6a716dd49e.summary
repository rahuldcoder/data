@entity0 -- pictured giggling on a park bench , 89 - year - old @entity2 soon - sang and his wife , @entity4 , look as though they met just yesterday			1
in fact , they married more than 60 years ago			2
but for half a century , @entity4 believed her husband was dead , missing in action during the @entity10 ( 1950 - 53 )			1
then in august 2004 , a telephone call came from @entity12			2
" i thought someone was trying to make money off me			2
i got many calls like that over the years from @entity12 , but i did n't pay attention , " she said			2
this was no ordinary call			2
the voice on the other end of the line shook her to the core			2
it really was her husband			0
" i asked , ' are you really alive ? ' he answered , ' yes , i am alive			0
' then i asked if he knew so and so , and he did know them			0
that 's how i knew it was real			0
" when they finally met , they barely recognized each other			0
" he was so skinny , he was wobbling in , " recalled @entity4			0
" i could only recognize his nose			0
" in contrast @entity2 could n't believe how well fed his wife looked			1
" she looked like one of those landlords from the old days , " he said			0
" and the propaganda , that all @entity40 are starving to death ... that @entity43 are taking all the rice and only giving back rotten flour ... i only heard this kind of propaganda , so i thought she was dead			1
" we just held each other and cried			2
" @entity2 soon - sang had been captured by the @entity52 army in 1953 , two days before the @entity53 was signed			1
he spent three - and - a - half years in a prisoner of war camp and was then sent to work in the notorious coalmines at @entity56 , @entity52 -- also a production site for gunpowder			1
there he had remarried and had children -- though he said he never forgot about life before the war			1
" life in @entity52 was hard ' , he said			1
" so i always thought about my hometown			0
even though i believed my wife was dead , i always thought i 'd go back one day			1
" decades later , in 2004 , a " broker " got in touch -- they are middlemen who make their living smuggling people in and out of @entity52			1
" he told me that @entity4 and my son were in @entity12 with lots of money , that i should take the money and go back to @entity52 to live a better life			1
" aged 77 by then , he had managed to save up 20,000 @entity78 ( approximately us $ 150 ) selling cigarettes			0
" in @entity52 , that 's a lot of money			1
you could buy a small house with that			0
i gave that to my wife and said , ' i 'm going to pick acorns , i 'll be back in two or three days			2
' that 's how i left			0
" he said he meant to return			0
he wo n't talk about the family he left behind			0
" i 'm happy now			0
you 're my wife , " he told @entity4			2
but the bitterness of his choice is a reality for many whose lives and loyalties were split by a divided @entity52			1
why the @entity10 still matters @entity2 attends a lunch organized for prisoners of war like him -- a group of about a dozen men who meet three times a week , all of whom were held captive in the @entity52 long after the 1953 @entity53 agreement when @entity105 agreed to return all prisoners of war			1
@entity107 left his adopted daughter behind in @entity52 when he fled in 2001			1
" how can we see each other unless there 's reunification ? " he 's 81			0
he does not expect to see her again			0
he described the terrible hardships of his life in @entity52 , especially the six months he spent in a prisoner of war camp			1
" we were fed just a few hundred grams of grain a day , " he recalled			0
" i would wake up in the morning and grab handfuls of lice from my body			0
" for more than a decade after , his life was spent in a succession of regular prisons , often in solitary confinement in a cell no larger than the size of a crouching man			0
" when i came back to @entity40 , i asked them to take me to a prison here so i could compare			1
@entity40 prisons treated their prisoners better than @entity52 treated their citizens			1
" according to @entity40 's @entity137 , 8,343 former servicemen have returned to the @entity40 since 1953			1
eighty of those men escaped through a third country decades after the @entity53 was signed			0
based on their testimony , the @entity0 government believes there are still some 500 pows living in the @entity52			1
@entity107 feels the government should do more to bring them home			0
recently , unification minister @entity144 repeated his call for @entity52 to resolve the issue of former servicemen and other abductees kept by the @entity52			1
@entity105 claims they are there of their own free will			2
and in the absence of actual talks between the two countries , @entity0 has little leverage to orchestrate their release			2
men like @entity2 soon - sang and @entity107 are living proof that @entity105 is wrong			1
but many korean war veterans are now well into their eighties -- no longer at an age where fleeing across treacherous borders is particularly feasible			0
men whose fate was sealed when they were taken prisoner 60 years ago may never see freedom again .			2

@entity2 soon - sang and his wife reunited after more than half a century
@entity2 was taken prisoner by @entity52 after the @entity10 ( 1950 - 53 )
thinking his wife was dead , he remarried and had children in @entity52
@entity40 has called on @entity105 to release all servicemen held there
