@entity0 , @entity1 -- friday 's test launch of the @entity7 rocket was " essentially a bullseye , " @entity4 officials said after the rocket successfully pushed past the earth 's atmosphere and deposited a mock - up of its @entity14 space capsule in orbit			1
the successful launch is the latest step toward commercial space ventures that could eventually ferry astronauts and cargo to the international space station			1
@entity4 ceo @entity22 , co-founder of @entity23 , sent out the technical details of the successful launch , which he said performed its mission to deposit the @entity14 mock - up into a 155 - mile ( 250 - km ) orbit to near perfection			1
" nominal shutdown and orbit was almost exactly 250 km , " @entity22 said in a written statement			0
" @entity33 showed essentially a bullseye : 126 ; 0.2 % on perigee and 126 ; 1 % on apogee			0
" the capsule is expected to orbit for about a year and eventually burn up in the atmosphere			2
@entity41 administrator @entity40 congratulated the @entity4 team			1
" @entity4 's accomplishment is an important milestone in the commercial transportation effort and puts the company a step closer to providing cargo services to the @entity49 , " he said			1
former @entity51 astronaut @entity50 was high on the launch 's possibilities			0
" as a former @entity51 astronaut , i think it 's safe to say that @entity4 and the other commercial developers embody the 21st century version of the @entity51 frontier spirit			2
it 's enormously gratifying to see them succeed today , " he said			0
@entity41 hopes companies such as @entity4 can take over transportation to the international space station			1
" it 's time for @entity41 to hand that over to commercial industry who can then optimize the technology and make it more reliable , make it much lower cost and make it much more routine , " said @entity22 in an interview with @entity2 last month			2
@entity22 says he believes the @entity73 is at the beginning of a profound , fundamental renaissance in space exploration , perhaps greater than when president @entity77 declared the @entity73 was going to the moon during the infancy of the space program			1
" if the country executes and the administration and @entity85 execute in that direction , the impact of these changes will be on par , perhaps even greater , than ... the task that @entity77 put us on to , " he said			0
this push toward the privatization of space is part of president @entity94 's blueprint to allow @entity41 to do bigger and better things with its budget , such as a mission to @entity98			1
@entity41 has been flying shuttles in low @entity101 orbit and going to and from the space station for 30 years			1
the administration would like to see whether private companies can do it cheaper and more efficiently , as the shuttle program is about to fly into retirement			1
@entity41 selected @entity4 and another company , @entity108 , to each develop an orbital vehicle because the @entity73 will not have its own way to get to the space station			1
the @entity73 will be renting space from the @entity113 aboard their @entity115 spacecraft			1
" they 're standing on @entity41 's shoulders , so they 're designing rockets based on the experience we 've had for 50 years or more , going into space , " said @entity116 , editor of the @entity117			1
" and any enterprise that learns from past experience will hopefully do better , " he said			0
but the competition is rabid			0
@entity4 is the first company to reach the launchpad			2
so far , its spent almost $ 400 million to get there			0
" they probably hate each other 's guts , but the competition is really good for space and for all of us , " said @entity116			2
" ultimately , what do we want from this ? we want to get into space cheaply , so our kids and grandkids someday can go into space and explore the planets , " he said			0
but @entity4 acknowledges there will be failures , as there have been since the the beginning of aviation			2
" this is an all - new rocket			0
there 's a lot that can go wrong , and during the test phase -- that 's why you have a test phase , because things may go wrong , " he said			0
@entity159 is a vice president for @entity4			2
in his previous life , he flew five space shuttle missions as a commander and pilot			2
he also lived on the space station for more than five months as its commander			1
" either way , we 're going to learn something , " he said			0
" if we have a problem , we can move forward accepting a higher level of risk			0
that 's how we can be more cost - effective			0
if all goes as planned after a series of test flights , @entity22 says @entity4 will be ready to begin flying cargo to the space station next year			1
if @entity41 awards spacex a contract , @entity22 says they can begin ferrying astronauts to the space station within three years			1
he says his company is profitable , but his motivations go beyond dollars			0
" we want to see a future where we are exploring the stars , where we 're going to other planets , where we 're doing the great things that we read about in science fiction and in the movies , " @entity22 said			0
@entity2 's @entity192 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 launches @entity7 rocket friday
with shuttle program about to end , @entity41 looking to private companies to fill *gap*
@entity73 will rely on @entity113 to get to and from the international space station for now
founder hopes @entity4 will be ready to begin flying cargo to space station next year
