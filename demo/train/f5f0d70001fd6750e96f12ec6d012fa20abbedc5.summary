countries out there with so much to show off ? granted , spending january in the middle of @entity7 wo n't do your poor circulation much good , and july in @entity9 requires industrial - strength antiperspirant			1
but for each month there 's a perfect city , and conversely each city can be best enjoyed in a specific month			1
here 's a yearlong guide to the when , where and why : january : @entity16 or @entity17 , @entity18 why : the chance to shorten your bucket list : specifically , to mark off the northern lights			1
although the aurora borealis can be spotted anywhere between latitudes 65 and 72 degrees , @entity18 towns such as @entity17 , @entity16 , @entity24 and @entity25 offer ringside seats , especially in the winter			1
sail @entity18 's fiord - lined coasts aboard a @entity34 cruise ship , and the crew will provide wake - up calls when viewing is best			1
if snowmobiling and dog sledding under shimmery green curtains of solar particles colliding with atmospheric gases are n't on your bucket list , you just need better gloves			1
weather report : to quote @entity18 explorer @entity44 , " there 's no such thing as bad weather , only inappropriate clothing			1
" who should avoid : anyone dead set on maintaining a year - round suntan			1
7 stunning @entity54 ski lodges february : @entity55 why : if you thought the @entity58 ' costumes were crazy during the @entity59 , wait until you see them at @entity62			1
millions jam the streets for exuberant samba dancing , drumming and wild displays of joy			1
@entity69 , the world 's largest art - deco statue , watches over it all from @entity73			1
you do n't have to be tall or tan or young or lovely to enjoy @entity74 and @entity55 's other famous beaches			1
but you do need a bikini , the skimpier the better			1
( bottom half only for guys			1
) weather report : @entity80 and hot ( average 32 degrees celsius / 90 degrees @entity81 ) , perfect for the beach and revealing outfits			1
who should avoid : prudes who believe women should stick to turtlenecks			1
@entity91 's top @entity90 destinations for 2013 march : @entity92 why : art , food , weather ... in addition to the year - round views			1
although you 'll want to spend time in the forward - thinking @entity102 city of @entity103 -- maybe taking in the 2013 @entity104 ( march 6 - 24 ) -- this is the perfect month to get out in the country , where adorable lambs are everywhere , magically bounding from one beautiful hillside to another			2
it 's still warm enough for a day at the beach , yet fall colors are starting to erupt			2
@entity112 , where else can you take in a food festival that celebrates foraged food ? the @entity115 ( march 9 ) offers such delicacies as huhu grubs , sheep brains , gorse flower wine and wasp larvae ice cream			2
weather report : gorgeous , crisp days with averages in the low 20s c / low 70s @entity123 who should avoid : squeamish eaters			2
april : @entity128 , @entity129 why : get a jump on your tan			2
when deciding on which of @entity128 's sandy beaches to put down your blanket , start at the @entity136 , a 45 - meter ( 148 - foot ) white jade icon with 360 - degree views of @entity129 's biggest island and the @entity140			2
just know that arguments are fierce as to which beach is best -- there 's one for every taste from hard - to - find @entity145 to upscale resorts such as the @entity147			2
weather report : monsoons do n't start until next month , so slather on the sunscreen and get comfortable			2
who should avoid : the fun - averse			2
may : @entity152 why : @entity154 photos minus other tourists ' backs and heads			1
during may 's @entity162 , when everybody flees the city , @entity159 's capital is as empty as you 'll ever find it			2
the city 's 160,000 - odd restaurants are practically empty ( relatively speaking ) , and you might even get a bid in at one of 1,000 stalls in @entity171			2
carp streamers known as koinobori are flying , the mountains are a lush green and , by the time everyone returns to the city , you 'll be going the other direction -- to the countryside or @entity180 or @entity181 , where the cherry blossoms and accompanying hanami parties are just starting to bloom			1
weather report : with summer 's crippling humidity still a month or so away , gardens and blossoms are at their height and temperatures in the low 20s c / low 70s @entity123 who should avoid : travelers who enjoy being lost in crowds			1
june : @entity193 , @entity194 why : to perfect your golf swing			1
ever since 2009 , when @entity197 came from behind to knock out @entity198 in the @entity199 , becoming the first male @entity200 to win a major ( the women have been winning championships since 1998 ) , golfing in @entity194 has taken off like a bottle rocket			1
with the @entity205 to be hosted here in 2015 and lots of new , upscale private clubs opening -- many that resemble modern art museums -- @entity194 is becoming a legit golf destination			1
weather report : mild temperatures and lots of camellias and azaleas			2
who should avoid : cheapskates			2
@entity194 's fancy new golf courses require large membership fees			1
july : @entity220 and @entity221 why : to experience the @entity222 , when thousands of wildebeest and zebras move across the sun - dried landscape of the @entity222			2
in july , you can ditch the crowds in the pristine , rarely visited northern @entity222 and more popular @entity230			1
weather report : dry with pleasant temps , average high of 28 c / 82 @entity123 who should avoid : city dwellers who hate the outdoors and / or camping			0
august : @entity240 , @entity241 why : while it 's roasting in the rest of the @entity244 , this 400 - year - old city with cobblestone streets , eclectic cafe culture and nonstop entertainment rings in with perfect temps			0
a lot of freebie entertainment is available , from @entity251 shows ( tickets in other cities go for $ 100 - plus ) to fireworks over the @entity255 to the world 's largest movie screen			0
weather report : mostly sunny with an average 25 c / 77 @entity123 who should avoid : tightwads who dislike tipping -- street performers on every corner pass hats			0
september : @entity265 , @entity266 why : it 's naturally beautiful throughout the year , but @entity265 is in prime spring form with flowers sprouting everywhere			0
but because it 's technically off - season , air fare and hotel bargains are available for bargain hunters			0
offshore you 'll find magnificent right whales in the process of making more magnificent right whales			0
weather report : temps pleasant with cool evenings			0
who should avoid : claritin addicts			0
october : @entity282 , @entity283 why : the ultimate party ( 6 million takers per year ) is in full swing			0
despite its many imitators , the original @entity288 , where beer is n't classified as alcohol but as a " health drink , " is hard to top			0
it 's so popular no one wants to wait till october to start ; the 2013 event runs from september 21 to october 6			0
men wear lederhosen , women sport boob - accentuating dirndls , oompah bands play and everyone is singing , albeit somewhat poorly			0
while you might imagine that playing a prost song every seven minutes ( that 's the average toasting interval ) could lead to a fast descent into chaos , @entity283 value rules and order , and even when tents are canvas - wall - to - canvas - wall , civility prevails			0
for those hoping to finance the rest of their year of travel , take note that @entity288 workers can earn $ 19,000 in 16 days			0
crucial tip : make a table reservation six months to a year ahead of time -- those who just show up to the party will not be able to find a seat inside any of the tents and wo n't be served			0
weather report : temperatures are crisp and cool ( about 16 @entity326 ) , and @entity328 's mountains are in their full autumn glory			0
who should avoid : @entity331			0
november : @entity332 , @entity333 why : with more than 50 beaches ( that 's just those in the city limits ) and 300 days of sunshine , there 's no such thing as a bad time to visit this city			0
but in november , before summer air fares kick in , reasonable flights and hotel rooms can be scored			0
and even though the @entity347 is run hundreds of miles to the south ( on november 5 ) , the thoroughbred horse race incites a countrywide party			0
weather report : beach weather ( mid- 20s c / mid- 70s f ) without the crowds			0
who should avoid : people without sunscreen			0
december : @entity356 why : @entity357			1
no sooner did sweaty @entity59 bodies pack up their medals and go home than @entity356 began unpacking its impressive holiday decorations			1
the sweet - spirited @entity362 left a legacy that @entity365 's capital does n't take lightly			0
from the giant @entity18 spruce ( given to @entity356 by @entity18 each year ) at @entity366 to @entity368 's @entity367 to @entity369 , @entity370 's and other department stores ' extravagant , light - strewn windows , 't is definitely the season to be jolly			1
carolers , light displays , ice skating and choirs at @entity379 make this the quintessential place to celebrate @entity382			0
not to mention that massive bargains and sales take center stage right after @entity386			0
weather report : cold , wet days are perfect for sipping mulled wine in front of cozy , wood - burning fireplaces			0
who should avoid : anyone who uses words like " bah " and " humbug			0
