-- @entity1 says the reaction of his fellow drivers to @entity5 's controversial new rule changes after the opening @entity7 of the season was " hot - headed			1
" the @entity9 claimed victory in @entity11 on his debut for @entity13 but fellow drivers @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 were critical of 2010 's new laws			1
they include a ban on refuelling during the race and that the grid 's top ten drivers must start the race on the tires they used to complete the final qualifying session			1
but @entity1 says it is too early to consider changing the rules and has pleaded for patience			1
he said on @entity13 's official web site : " i think that many of us have given some hot - headed comments immediately after the race in @entity11			1
" it 's true that the race in @entity37 was n't especially spectacular -- although for us ferraristi it was great and exciting -- but it 's too early to talk about changing the rules			2
" we have to see how the tyres behave with different fuel loads and temperatures , which will be different from the ones we had during testing and in @entity11			2
" we have to wait and see different races and check the situation , without being emotional			0
something that confuses the fans is changing the rules all the time			0
" @entity1 and teammate @entity51 gave @entity13 the perfect start to the season with a one - two in @entity11 , but the @entity9 says no - one is getting carried away			1
he added : " the one - two win in @entity37 gave us confidence and was a great result for the hard work during the winter on the track and at the works , but we ca n't take anything for granted			2
" we have to stay with our feet on the ground , keeping calm and staying concentrated -- in @entity64 we 're starting from square one			0
" nothing has changed for me -- there are four teams and eight drivers who can fight for victory and we have to give it our all to stay ahead of everybody else			0
" i like the @entity75 track			0
it 's quite a technical circuit with some pretty interesting corners			0
@entity78 has never been easy and what is even more important now , like on all city circuits , is the result in the qualifying			0
