-- as @entity2 left prison , a free woman for the first time in four years , many were left wondering how someone they 've been told was responsible for a bloody murder could walk free			1
for four years , people have been hearing how " @entity2 , " an " angel - faced killer , " led her rich @entity10 boyfriend @entity9 and a " drifter " named @entity12 into a " sex game gone wrong " the night after @entity14 2007 , finally stabbing @entity16 exchange student @entity12 to death with a kitchen knife			1
through the course of a trial and an appeal , it became clear that the police had no material evidence for this theory and no plausible witnesses			0
our obsession with female evil , our fascination with the possibility of a depraved criminal hiding behind a pretty face , drove the coverage of this case , eliciting innuendo as fact , and excluding at least half of the narrative			0
only the most die - hard crime story aficionados even know the name @entity12 , who was already in jail for @entity46 's murder			1
even as @entity47 returned to @entity48 , people around the world , especially in @entity10 , will never be convinced she is anything other than a sexual psychotic who bewitched two men into killing for her in the name of lust			1
king : @entity2 returns to @entity48 i began researching my book on the case in 2009 assuming that @entity47 was guilty			1
but after only a month in @entity10 , i realized that almost no evidence supported the charge			1
eventually , i corresponded with @entity47 in prison			0
the young woman i interacted with seemed troubled by her incarceration , a bit detached and naive , but overall not much different from other women her age			0
during my investigation , i came to realize that even though three people were convicted of killing @entity46 , most people i met who were not reporters could only recall the name of the woman			1
@entity76 : @entity48 reacts to @entity47 's release none of the journalists in the huge pack in @entity81 over the years made any but the most casual efforts to uncover the life story and habits of small - time break - in artist @entity12 , whose fingerprints were in the murder room , who never denied being there as @entity46 was bleeding to death , and who has been convicted of murdering her in a separate trial			1
his own story -- an immigrants ' son , adopted and then disowned by one of the richest families in @entity81 , suffering from fugue states and sleep - walking -- makes him one of the more interesting characters in the case			0
his past criminal history involving break - ins certainly made him worthy of more study , but no one was inclined to pursue his tale			0
one reason for the focus on " @entity2 " to the exclusion of the men is the @entity10 attitude toward women			1
the story is rooted in a spirituality based in sex and the worship of the female			1
in @entity10 , the word " veneration " comes from @entity119 , goddess of fertility , called in @entity10 , @entity121			1
the primeval object of " veneration " was the goddess with the power to call forth desire from men , and to make barren women fertile			2
in modern @entity10 , one feminine deity is venerated above the rest : @entity133 , the mother of @entity134			2
the young virgin is worshipped apart from @entity136 or @entity137 and the @entity133 cult is stronger in @entity10 than in any other @entity140 nation			2
the flip side to @entity10 veneration of the female deity is her legendary insatiable neediness , the voracious desire and jealousy of females , embodied in the whore , who is also still very much a part of modern @entity10 culture			1
either incarnation carries terrible powers			1
all women are assumed to be in possession of bewitching seductive powers , but proper women are assumed to know how to use control and limit those powers			2
modern young women visiting @entity10 might not recognize those limits , though , because the stripper or girly show girl was so mainstreamed in @entity10 , especially during the years of @entity164 's control of @entity10 television and politics			1
@entity81 's @entity167 in the @entity168 is a larger - than - life , clearly pregnant young woman , painted in 1515 by one of @entity81 's @entity172 greats			2
she wears a brocade blue dress , and her pale eyes are strangely distant and slightly uneven			0
@entity175 hundreds of years ago adorned her image with a real crown			0
prosecutor @entity178 , a staunch traditional @entity179 , kept her image hanging on the wall behind his desk and spoke of how she had helped his uncle escape from certain death at the hands of the @entity186 in the 1940s			0
the @entity167 has a pale , heart - shaped face , tiny pert nose , light distant eyes , and small perfect mouths			2
@entity47 bears an uncanny resemblance to both of them			0
the hippie soccer player from 21st century @entity48 could have been the @entity172 artist 's model			0
many forces abetted the confusion over this very simple if horrible crime , which was almost surely a robbery gone wrong			0
@entity202 , shoddy police work , cultural and actual mistranslation were among those forces			0
the sexuality of the female at the center of the narrative was one of them			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

@entity213 : the focus was on ' @entity2 , ' even though two men were also convicted
she says reporters virtually ignored story of @entity12 , the man in jail for the murder
the treatment of @entity2 was rooted in the @entity10 attitude toward women , she *writes*
@entity229 : in @entity10 , many see women as @entity167 or whore , with terrible powers over men
