-- proponents of same - sex marriage got a boost on two fronts monday , when the governor of @entity6 signed a bill legalizing marriage for gay and lesbian couples and the @entity11 voted 24 - 16 in favor of a similar bill			1
the @entity15 bill now goes to the @entity16 , which is slated to vote thursday			1
" we 're cautiously optimistic " about its chances for passage , said @entity17 , a spokesman for @entity18 , which has lobbied for the bill			2
but the legislation is threatened in both states			2
@entity15 gov. @entity26 said last month that the issue " should not be decided by 121 people in the @entity28 in @entity29			0
" instead , he favors a statewide referendum			0
" i think that this is not an issue that should rest solely in my hands , in the hands of the @entity11 president or in the hands of the speaker or the other 118 members of the @entity40 , " he said			1
" let 's let the people of @entity15 decide what is right for the state			2
" if he vetoes the measure , " the battle for overriding the veto begins , " @entity17 said			2
gov. @entity49 's signature to legislation legalizing same - sex marriage added her state to a list that includes @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and the @entity61			1
the law will go into effect in june , when the legislative session ends , but opponents have vowed to try to halt its implementation by putting it on the november ballot			0
that possibility did not appear to dampen the spirits of those who attended the bill - signing ceremony			1
" we have finally said yes to marriage equality , " @entity49 said to applause moments before signing the bill			1
" it gives same - sex couples the same right to a marriage license as heterosexual couples			1
" she noted that churches are not required to perform same - sex marriages under the law and expressed confidence that , if put to a state - wide vote , @entity87 would back the measure			1
" i believe our @entity87 will say yes because it 's time for us to stand up for our sons and daughters , our brothers and sisters , our moms and dads , our friends and the couple down the road , " she said			2
" it is time to give our loving gay and lesbian couples the right to a marriage license in @entity6			1
" but the news for same - sex marriage advocates is not all positive			1
in states where legislators have passed @entity108 , which define marriage as being between a man and a woman only , they are taking defensive action			1
@entity114 is set to vote in a may primary election on such an act , and @entity117 is to hold such a vote in november			0
in 2009 , @entity120 legislators passed a same - sex marriage bill that drew challenges by opponents who pushed for a referendum that ultimately overturned the law with 53 % of the vote			1
proponents are trying to get it back on the ballot this year			0
gay rights advocates have garnered thousands of signatures in an effort to force a second referendum in november			0
in @entity135 , a 2008 public vote outlawed gay and lesbian couples ' right to wed. two years later , a federal district court overturned the voter - approved measure known as @entity140 , saying couples were unfairly denied their rights			1
a federal appeals court ruled last week against @entity135 's ban , arguing that it unconstitutionally singles out gays and lesbians for discrimination			2
the ban has remained in place during the appeals process and could soon get a ruling from the @entity153 @entity152			0
similar battles have unfolded in @entity155 , where same - sex marriage opponents have pressed for referenda to counter bills that appear to enjoy growing support in their statehouse			1
the @entity162 , which opposes same - sex marriage , predicted that the referenda will block the marriages from taking place			1
" ultimately , the people are going to decide , and we 're confident that the people will vote to protect marriage as the union between a man and a woman , " president @entity167 said			2
" the legislature 's decision is a decision against the will of the people			2
" marriage , he said , is by definition the union of a man and a woman			0
" the state did not create that definition ; the state merely recognizes it			0
" statewide votes are not the way to handle the issue , according to @entity190 , director of public engagement for @entity192 to marry			0
" the question i like to pose to people is : would you like the entire state to vote on whether you could marry your husband or wife ? " she asked			0
but the trend among @entity153 seems to be moving toward acceptance of the practice			0
a @entity0 / @entity204 carried out in september found that 53 % of respondents said marriages between gay or lesbian couples should be recognized as valid , up from 44 % in 2009			0
the poll had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points			0
in september 's poll , @entity213 favored recognizing them as valid by 67 % to 31 % , independents by 53 % to 46 %			0
just 30 % of @entity216 said they favored recognizing same - sex marriage as valid , versus 69 % who did not			1
those results had a sampling error of plus or minus 6 points .			0
