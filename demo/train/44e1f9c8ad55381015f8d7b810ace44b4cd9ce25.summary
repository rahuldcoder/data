a bio-drone that dissolves after use leaving no trace it ever existed may sound like the stuff of a @entity6 film , but @entity7 and a team of researchers are actually building one			1
made from a substance that combines mushroom fibers and cloned paper wasp spit , the drone might resemble a propeller - powered egg carton , but its designers say it has the ability to fly into environmentally sensitive areas and leave almost no trace			1
@entity21 , the @entity7 developer guiding students from @entity24 - @entity23 working on the project , says the drone could be made to disappear simply by ditching it into a stream or puddle			1
she said her interest in unmanned aerial vehicles was sparked by work on environmentally sensitive areas in her @entity35 group at @entity7			1
" periodically , uavs get lost -- for example on coral reefs or in other sensitive habitats , " she said in an interview with the project team			1
" as i started to hear about this , i thought , ' well , would n't it be useful if the @entity38 was biodegradable , so if it crashed somewhere that was sensitive , it would n't matter if it dissolved			2
" the mushroom - like substance known as mycelium , which makes up the chassis of the drone , is being hailed as the new plastic -- a plastic that has the advantage of degrading quickly			1
the team grew cellulose " leather " to coat the fungal body of the flying craft and then covered the sheets with proteins sourced from the saliva of paper wasps -- a water resistant material that the insects use to cover their nests			0
the circuits are printed from silver nanoparticle ink in an effort to make the machine as biodegradable as possible			0
despite a heavy preponderance of biological parts , the team said the project had its limits			0
" there are definitely parts that ca n't be replaced by biology , " said @entity24 's @entity70			0
at its first short flight at the @entity76 competition in @entity77 , the team used a standard battery , motor and propellers to fly the drone			1
nevertheless , the team is working on making other parts biodegradable and is studying how to build its sensors from modified e. coli bacteria , the bacteria most commonly found in the intestines of humans and animals			2
the team said that ultimately the drone could be sent into areas where it might not be expected to return such as wildfires or nuclear accidents , sending data and never coming back			1
while the parts degrade naturally , the team also experimented with enzymes that would help the drone self - destruct , breaking it down further on impact			1
creating a drone that does not infect the environment has been another challenge for the team			2
" if you have living organisms acting as biosensors and the plane crashes , there certainly could be problems as the plane interacts with the environment , " @entity100 said			0
" hopefully people could think of this in advance , and design such that this never becomes a problem			0
" for example , on crashing , the cells might die			0
or the cells could be attenuated			0
there are all sorts of other processes to keep them from contaminating the environment			0
but that , to me , is the largest concern with a biological @entity38 - having living things on the uav			2

@entity7 is guiding a team building a bio-drone that can self - destruct and leave no trace if it crashes
the drone is made from a substance that combines mushroom fibers called mycelium
the unmanned aerial vehicle is also coated in substance made from a protein found in wasp spit
@entity7 says the uav could be used to fly into environmentally sensitive areas such as coral reefs
