the @entity0 and their fans are clear on one thing , says @entity3 : the goal is to make history and become the first rugby nation to win back - to - back @entity7			1
for many players , such lofty expectations could threaten to derail the whole mission			0
not so @entity3 , who is one of the game 's true superstars			1
" i absolutely love the pressure that not only the media and the public put on us , but also the pressure that we put on ourselves as a team , " the world 's all - time leading point - scorer told @entity16			1
on an ambassadorial visit to @entity26 , the @entity24 is taking a six - month break from the game as he seeks to revive his battered body for next year 's title defense in @entity31 and @entity32			1
next october 's final will be at @entity34 , the headquarters of @entity36 rugby -- a place where the 32 - year - old has endured both highs and lows in his career			1
winning in @entity26 heading abroad to another @entity42 where the @entity0 are certain favorites -- following their steamrollering 14 - game perfect year in 2013 -- @entity3 has every reason to be optimistic			1
but any @entity0 fan knows better , having watched mystified as similarly all - conquering teams have failed to capture the trophy except for the two occasions the tournament has taken place on home turf -- and they had an agonizing 24 - year gap between those successes			1
@entity3 knows there are a host of teams now hoping to seize on any sign of @entity0 weakness : he lists his old @entity60 rivals @entity62 and @entity63 , plus @entity31 , @entity64 , @entity32 , and even @entity65 as teams that could cause an upset			1
but , he says , the year ahead is about being ready for the challenge			0
" we had a great couple of years and the hype is starting to build in @entity0 -- especially as a player -- about the @entity42 so it 's going to be a challenging year in 2014			2
" lifting the cup @entity3 had the bittersweet pleasure of watching the @entity0 ' triumph in @entity75 in 2011 while sitting in the stand , having missed the majority of the tournament with a groin injury			1
@entity80 , who kicked what was ultimately the winning penalty against @entity83 , was called up to the squad for the final due to injuries suffered by @entity3 's replacements			2
" i 've been part of the squad that 's won the @entity42 before so , you know , that 's a huge achievement , " @entity3 says , diplomatically			2
this time he 's hoping to get the jump on the injury problems , taking a sabbatical from the game after his most recent @entity96 strain ahead of the international program , with the @entity0 ' southern - hemisphere rugby championship title defense starting in august			1
" physically and mentally , i 'm in a great space , " he says			0
fighting ghosts that @entity96 injury came on the occasion of his 100th international cap -- a tense showdown with @entity31 at @entity34 in november 2013 , where the @entity0 came out on top 30 - 22			1
what should have been a milestone celebration for the no. 10 ended as he hobbled off the pitch with just 25 minutes played			0
a year prior , at the same venue , @entity31 shocked @entity0 38 - 21 to end the @entity114 ' 20 - match unbeaten run			1
it was @entity31 's first win over the @entity0 at the " @entity117 " since 2002 -- and @entity3 has plenty of previous better memories of the hallowed venue			1
" i love playing at @entity34			0
it 's one of my favorite stadiums , " he said			0
" it 's a real rugby environment , rugby culture is everything to do with @entity34			0
" you know -- i 've had some great success there			0
lost one game there a couple of years ago but apart from that i 've had a lot of success at @entity34			0
" playing on @entity3 is delighted that when he finally vacates the no. 10 shirt for good , there will be a stream of worthy successors			2
" the beauty is , there 's a lot of depth in my position and with the injuries that i 've had in the last couple of years it 's given the opportunity for a lot of young guys coming through , " he said			0
" there 's @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 that have all had roles in the last year or two and every time they 've had the opportunity , they 've played extremely well			2
" but do n't start looking for replacements just yet : @entity3 , who has scored 1,440 points for the @entity0 , says he 'd love to keep playing for another four or five years " at least			2
" after the @entity42 , he 'll consider his future			0
it could mean a return to @entity158 , where he spent an injury - shortened spell with @entity162 club @entity160 in 2008 - 09 -- or even a move to @entity164			2
until 2015 he 'll be staying in @entity0 , and preparing for the challenge to come			0
" the pinnacle of any rugby player is to reach those heights but to do it away from home , two tournaments in a row would be something pretty special , " @entity3 said			0
" i 'll be working as hard as i can to try and be there if the @entity0 can reach that milestone			0
