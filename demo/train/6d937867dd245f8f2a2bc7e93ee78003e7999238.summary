@entity12 is suspected of being the intermediary between the broker and former secret service policeman and the people who wanted the cash , he said			2
the operation put in place to bring in the money was " extremely sophisticated , " he said , in part because of the secret service officer 's role in the plan			1
investigators are looking at transactions from two accounts @entity12 held at the @entity4 bank , one a personal account and the other used for donations , he added			1
@entity4 spokesman the rev. @entity75 said @entity12 had been suspended from his work at the @entity4 more than a month ago , as soon as his superiors had been informed that he was under investigation			2
the @entity4 is ready and willing to cooperate with @entity11 authorities on the investigation when they get in touch , he said			1
@entity23 has been investigating the @entity4 bank 's role and relationship with @entity11 banks for some years			1
papal commission the arrests come in the same week that @entity87 established a papal commission tasked with investigating the activities of the @entity4 bank			1
the commission , made up of four clerics and a @entity93 law professor , will report to the pope with its findings " in view of possible reform , " @entity75 said , according to @entity98			0
the @entity4 has been plagued by internal power struggles over its murky finances for decades			0
