-- from personal stories of growing up with gay parents to challenges of what defines a family , the public 's comments on same - sex couples having families was supportive and critical , calm and heated -- sometimes all in one conversation thread			1

we asked readers and viewers what they thought about gay couples having families			2
" whether they are gay as a couple , or gay as a single parent -- as long as they love and nourish that child it will make absolutely no difference			1
compared to the atrocious things that we read here on @entity0 about what parents do to their children , being raised by a gay parent will be a blessing , " says one reader			1
" i work in a medical clinic and believe me , the large number of gay people / couples that we see are a helluva lot more ' normal ' ( and pleasant ) than the straight people / couples ! " others said that while they were against same - sex marriage , they saw no reason for sexual orientation to prevent having children through adoption or other means			1
" my morals and my religion agree that marriage is between a man and a woman , " says one reader			2
" [ but ] i do n't mind gays adopting			0
" another said : " marriage is an institution created by @entity63 to join a man and a women			0
that being said , children do need someone to love and if that person is psychologically sound , physically fit and has the wherewithal to create a supportive and loving environment for the child , it would [ be ] hard for me to say no way			1
" some said having same - sex parents would harm the child			1
" children being raised by gay couples can easily be targeted by bullies , " said one reader			1
" these children will go through a great suffering because they will be confused as to why they do n't [ have ] a daddy or a mommy			0
it 's a shame that the children are being exposed to something that @entity63 is against			2
" another wrote : " if there is a mother and father possibility , [ a child ] should always go in the favor of the normal mother and father situation			2
it is the responsibility of those in charge to give them the best chance to survive in a culture that is normally straight			0
i am not against gays , but i do think there is a reality that one gender of parents is not the norm			2
" other readers shared their stories of growing up with same - sex parents or being a gay parent themselves			1
" as a gay single man , it has been my honor to adopt four wonderful children , " one reader wrote			1
" over the years we have encountered the typical family pressures as everyone else			0

... parenting means being there for your child			1
it mean participating in their lives			0
listening to their goals , biting your tongue when necessary and losing your mind when needed			0
" another said , " my parents love me , that 's all that matters			1
what makes you a better parent then mine ? because you 're a @entity150 ? because you are straight ? they love me and that 's all that matters			2
