-- every morning before riding , @entity1 has to walk four miles			1
the walk is a necessity , the only way the 51 - year - old can get his ailing knees slowly warmed up and working , capable of dealing with the demands on those damaged joints of riding some of the world 's best horses at speeds of up to 45 mph			2
when the @entity15 first retired in 2005 , he had enough money in the bank from a glittering riding career to kill any thought of a comeback			1
then there was the ensuing broadcasting career , not to mention acting forays in the movie " @entity27 " and the television series " @entity26			1
" but he finds himself back in the saddle			1
" this is middle - aged crazy , " he says -- and without cracking a smile , all too aware of the risks being taken			2
one only has to watch the clip of him being trampled like a rag doll in the 2003 @entity37 race , suffering a punctured lung and a fractured vertebra in his back , to see that			2
" people retire and play golf or go fishing			2
i never thought i 'd say so at this time of my life but i 'd rather be on the race track than on the golf course , and i like golf , " says @entity1 , who started racing again at the start of last year			1
" and the 50s are the new 30s right ? anyway , i 'm not the only old guy out there			2
look , you 've got @entity55 in golf and he 's doing alright			2
" but his return demanded sacrifices			2
@entity1 had to shed the equivalent of 10 bags of sugar off his body and get down to a racing weight of 114 lbs ( 51.7 kg ) in a grueling two - month training regime			1
in addition , his knees are damaged to the point he knows he will need surgery to replace them			0
" you do n't realize how good it is until it 's gone , " he told @entity0 , explaining his decision to retire			0
" being retired allowed me to look back and actually enjoy some of the great things that had been accomplished in my first career			1
i was like ' wow			0
' if you won a big race , you could never rest on your laurels as there was the next day , the next race			0
" then there were the injuries and always thinking and obsessing , ' when will i get back ? ' i realized how good it was and i asked myself , ' can i do it again ? ' " i did n't want to come back and tarnish what i 'd done in the past			1
i wanted to come back at a high level			0
" sporting comebacks do n't generally tend to end well			0
@entity1 , though , has provided a @entity91 epilogue befitting his secondary career on the silver screen			1
last year , he won 69 races including the prestigious @entity95 and the @entity96 , and he is fast approaching 5,000 career victories on @entity15 soil alone			1
he notched up $ 100 million in winnings by the age of 30 , and he is now nearer the $ 225 million mark			0
there are parallels between @entity1 and another giant of flat racing , @entity106 , who famously returned to the saddle aged 55 -- in his case after a year in prison for tax evasion			1
much like @entity1 , his success was almost immediate , the @entity114 rider capping his return by winning the @entity116 within 10 days of his return			1
" it 's funny , " says @entity1 , " but no - one 's actually asked me about the @entity106 link before			1
the way he rode that @entity96 , arguably one of the best rides of his career , making all the right moves at the right time			1
so my thought was , ' if he can do it and i 'm younger , then why not			0
' the guy was a bit of an inspiration			0
" @entity26 has also played a part in @entity1 ' return to the saddle			1
he had previously been enjoying an acting career in the @entity139 - directed tv series " luck " alongside the likes of @entity142 and @entity143 , but it was cut short before the second season began due to concerns over animal safety			1
" if that had n't been axed , i 'm not sure i 'd be doing this , " he says			1
" i was all set to meet in makeup the next day at 4.30 a.m. when i got an email saying it might be scrapped			0
" @entity152 a couple of phone calls a few minutes later , sure enough , it was over			0
i was just lost , it was like losing a family member			0
in that first week , i made the decision to come back			0
" @entity1 will forever be grateful for his acting career -- he describes it as one of " two dream jobs i 've had " -- but it has also acted as @entity162 for him , having met his wife @entity163 on the first day of filming " @entity27			1
" " i turned up on the set and this lady appeared as a silhouette			0
she said , ' you look lost , ' and i was like , ' i need to find where i 'm supposed to be			0
' i explained i was playing @entity168 and she showed me to my trailer			0
" he did not lay eyes on her for the next five months but , as the movie wrapped up , they met again , went for dinner and the rest is history			0
such hollywood-esque nuggets are littered throughout the life of the man from @entity179 , @entity180			1
there was the hip condition called @entity186 syndrome that forced him to wear a metal brace for 19 months at the age of seven , his decision to drop out of high school in 1979 to become a jockey -- also the year he won his first race -- difficulties with alcohol in his career , and now the ongoing return to the sport of kings : all quite remarkable for a grandfather			1
but he argues he is currently at his happiest			1
" it 's an unbelievable ride , better than the first time around , " he says			0
" it 's been very gratifying as i do n't think people expected me to come back at the level i did			0
i did n't expect it			0
but i 'm very hard on myself and motivated so i made it happen			0
that was the thing missing in my life , i just did n't have anything to push myself			2
" how is the @entity1 @entity208 in his own mindset as a jockey ? " i think i 'm better in the sense that my broadcast work has made me more analytical , " he adds			1
" i really think watching racing for seven years has developed my skills			2
" it 's been crazy , what a journey , hey ? if it ends tomorrow i 'd be a happy guy			2
my life is more than half over and it 's been a good life			2
" the @entity91 ending , it would seem , has already been sealed .			0

@entity1 is relishing life in the saddle having returned to being a jockey past his 50th *birthday*
injury forced his *original* retirement and he 'd been enjoying an acting career
but the lure of horse racing proved too much and he has returned in some style
he argues his role as a broadcaster has enabled him to become a better jockey
