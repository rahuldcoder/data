-- september 9 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 @entity8 , @entity9 transcript this is a @entity12			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity16 , @entity17 : hi , i 'm @entity19 with your morning announcements			1
one : @entity0 is on , and you 're gon na love it			1
two : the @entity24 teachers ' lounge is open , and you 're gon na hear more about it in just a few minutes ! first up : economic plans @entity27 : first up , though , the economy , and a pair of plans that both aim to give it a needed boost			1
the first one comes from president @entity35			2
during a visit to @entity4 , @entity5 yesterday , he laid out his ideas to help the economy			1
they include cutting taxes for businesses that buy new equipment or do new research ; and spending money on the country 's infrastructure , things like roads and power programs			1
he also talked about some of the things that have happened since he took office in 2009			2
@entity52 president @entity35 : our economic plan has invested in badly needed infrastructure projects over the last nineteen months			1
not just roads and bridges , but high - speed railroads and expanded broadband access			2
altogether , these are projects that have led to thousands of good , private sector jobs , especially for those in the trades			2
mr. @entity65 and the @entity66 in @entity67 said no to these projects , fought them tooth and nail			2
@entity27 : you heard president @entity35 mention a mr. @entity65 there			2
that would be @entity66 house minority leader @entity65			2
he says the president 's economic plans so far have n't worked , and mr. @entity65 does n't think the new ideas will work either			1
he 's pushing a different plan to boost the economy , one that comes from @entity66 leaders in @entity67			1
this one has two main points			2
the first is to cut government spending			2
congressman @entity65 says that 's caused more debt and fewer jobs			1
the second point is to put a freeze on tax rates for two years			2
mr. @entity65 argues that when taxes go up , it hurts families and small businesses			2
@entity93 @entity27 : when it comes to something like the @entity99 oil spill , a lot of people want to know whom can be blamed			2
well , there 's a new report out that puts most of that blame on @entity103 and @entity104 , two companies that @entity93 hired to work on the oil well			1
but the report was written by @entity93			2
the company did accept some of the responsibility			2
it says faulty cementing , a misread pressure test , and a blowout preventer that was n't maintained correctly all led to the spill			2
@entity104 and @entity103 have criticized @entity93 's report			1
one expert talked about how this whole situation is a unique one			2
@entity119 , professor , @entity121 , @entity122 : what 's interesting in this case is that , you know , they actually went through eight steps and no one said , " hey , stop			1
" that , to me , is more of a rig problem than , say , a systemic problem across the oil industry			2
@entity134 @entity27 : 85 fires in four hours			2
that 's what firefighters in @entity6 , @entity7 had to deal with tuesday night			1
there were so many fires that nearby towns sent emergency workers to help out			2
fire officials say a lot of the blazes started when strong winds knocked down power lines			0
the winds then carried flames from house to house			0
that caused nine homes to catch fire on one block alone			0
officials say no one was hurt , but a power company spokesperson said 15,000 people still did n't have power yesterday morning			0
authorities think at least one fire might have been caused by arson ; it might have been set on purpose			0
is this legit ? @entity164 , @entity17 : is this legit ? fasting during the @entity166 holy month of @entity167 is one of the five pillars of @entity170			1
true ! during @entity167 , @entity166 do n't eat or drink during daylight hours			1
@entity172 @entity27 : there are more than a billion @entity166 around the world			1
and for them , @entity167 is the most sacred time of the year			0
it 's been going on since august ; it 'll finish at the end of this week			1
but the exact date when @entity167 finishes this year has some @entity166 considering how they might celebrate the end of @entity167			1
it 's on september 11th , and this is the first time since the 9/11 attacks that @entity167 has ended on that date			1
@entity181 visits an @entity170 center in @entity9 to see how celebrations might be balanced with sensitivity			1
( begin video ) @entity186 , @entity24 national correspondent : afternoon prayers at the @entity170 center of @entity8			0
as @entity167 draws to a close later this week , these worshipers are being advised to tone down what is usually a celebratory occasion			0
@entity193 , president , islamic center of @entity8 : after 30 days of fasting , you know , this is the month that ended our celebration			0
@entity202 : how will it be different this year ? shah : this year will be a little different			0
you know , we are not celebrating the way we suppose to do , normally would do			0
@entity202 : because ? shah : because of 9/11			0
@entity202 : the end of @entity167 , or @entity208 , depending on the moon thursday night , falls on either friday or saturday , which is september 11th			0
but many @entity166 have decided to mark it on friday			1
imam @entity213 @entity212 is the head of the @entity215 in @entity9 , an umbrella group of @entity166 organizations			1
@entity218 @entity217 , @entity219 : i guess people may think , look at @entity208 as a protest , you know , against , against people who may be celebrating			0
@entity202 : one @entity166 group , for example , celebrates @entity208 at @entity228 parks			1
this year , organizers have been careful not to schedule their events for september 11th			0
it comes against the backdrop over anger about the proposed @entity170 center near @entity235 and protests at other mosques around the country			0
@entity166 are trying to send out their own message , like this public service announcement created through grassroots efforts			1
@entity242 , @entity243 : i do n't want to take over this country			0
@entity202 : one @entity166 leader who works with an interfaith youth group in @entity248 says he feels the attitude towards @entity166 this year is unlike any other			1
@entity250 , @entity251 : frankly , i have not felt this fearful			0
a mother came up to me at my @entity166 house of worship earlier this week and said to me , " @entity256 , when will my 8 and 10 - year - old sons stop being bullied on the playground because of their names , @entity260 and @entity261 ? " and what i said to her is " very soon , very soon , " because the forces of inclusion in @entity52 have always defeated the forces of intolerance , and they will defeat the forces of intolerance again			1
@entity202 : this 9/11 , this mosque in @entity271 , @entity9 will dedicate a peace garden with other clergy , but it has also asked local police for protection following suspicious incident of broken windows at the mosque			0
@entity279 says his group has also decided not to hold a counter-protest saturday supporting the @entity170 center near @entity235 after the families of 9/11 victims requested they not hold the rally			0
@entity286 : we 've been encouraging our people to be calm , to be patient , but be firm and be strong and to reach out , you know			0
@entity202 : and this @entity170 center , for one , is opening its doors to hold open houses with the aim of promoting understanding			0
( @entity295 ) @entity296 @entity27 : @entity167 is n't the only religious holiday that 's happening this week			1
@entity296 , the @entity298 new year , began last night			0
it marks the start of the @entity301 , which end ten days later with @entity302			0
in @entity303 , @entity296 means " beginning of the year			0
" it 's also sometimes referred to as the " day of repentance " or " day of remembrance			1
" one of the holiday 's most significant rituals is the blowing of the shofar			1
it 's a ram 's horn that 's used to call people to worship during the @entity301			1
@entity314 @entity315 , @entity17 : time for the shoutout ! what is the name for small , rocky objects that are found in space ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity326 or @entity327 ) @entity328 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! l those rocky objects are called asteroids , and most of them are found between @entity333 and @entity334			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity338 @entity27 : the space community is buzzing about two asteroids that buzzed by @entity341 yesterday			1
one passed our planet in the morning			0
the other went by about 12 hours later			0
both of them were closer to the @entity341 than the moon is			0
officials say neither asteroid were any sort of threat to our planet			0
unless you had a telescope , you would n't even have been able to see them			0
what 's interesting about this is both asteroids passed so close to @entity341 on the same day , and that @entity361 spotted them so far in advance			1
the @entity24 teachers ' lounge @entity27 : we ask for your opinions on our blog , and you 're great about giving them to us			0
now , though , it 's your teachers ' turn ! the @entity373 is up and running			1
teachers , this is where you can sound off on education issues			0
this week 's question : when is the best time to start a new school year ? log on to the lounge at @entity381 , and tell us what you think			1
before we go @entity27 : all right , before we go , water skiing ai n't easy the first time you do it			0
even kneeboarding requires a bit of balance			0
this here dog has twice the legs we do , though , combined with a fish 's love for the water			1
and when it comes to tricks , sit , shake and roll over have nothing on this			0
chibi the water skiing dog is giving the water skiing squirrel a run for its acorns			0
how do you top this ? one neighbor says skydiving , maybe parasailing			0
