-- some of the president 's men are still working			0
in golf 's @entity4 , that is			2
and while @entity7 president @entity6 was n't in attendance in @entity9 -- he has more important things to worry about -- a former president , @entity11 , greeted both teams thursday at the @entity13			1
the biennial competition , which pits the @entity7 against the rest of the world minus @entity17 , has been kinder to the @entity7 than the more prestigious @entity18			1

the @entity7 featured six players in the top 10 in the rankings , including world @entity25 and @entity28 @entity27			1
the @entity20 , by contrast , had one -- masters champion @entity31			0

but after about a 90 - minute delay because of thunderstorms , the @entity20 fought back			2
by day 's end , it was 3.5 to 2.5 for the @entity7 , a slender advantage			1
@entity44 's dramatic putt at the 18th gave the @entity46 and @entity45 a win over @entity48 and @entity49 after @entity27 and @entity50 routed @entity51 and @entity52 5 and 4			0
" it 's awfully fun partnering the no. 1 player in the world , " @entity50 said in a televised interview			1
the @entity7 fell behind as @entity58 and @entity59 lost to @entity60 and @entity61 2 and 1 before @entity31 and @entity62 halved with @entity63 and @entity64			0
@entity65 and @entity66 eased past @entity67 and @entity68 5 and 3 to level the match			0
in the decider , @entity70 and @entity71 edged @entity73 and @entity74			0
@entity70 's short putt at the 18th gave the @entity7 the lead heading into friday 's foursomes .			0

after the opening day of the @entity4 , the @entity7 leads 3.5 to 2.5 in @entity9
thunderstorms *temporarily* halted play during thursday 's fourballs at @entity13
