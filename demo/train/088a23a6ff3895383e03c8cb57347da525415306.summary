@entity0 , @entity1 -- while the whistleblower website @entity4 is shaking up the @entity5 and its diplomatic relations with the international community , @entity1 has got its own spate of " audio leaks " which has gripped local media and the public			1
the controversy has hit top government officials , some of the nation 's wealthiest tycoons and the ' @entity17			1
' recordings of phone conversations between a lobbyist and prominent journalists , industrialists and politicians leaked in the past few weeks reveal that some of @entity1 's most influential journalists served as power brokers for a deal that is considered one of @entity1 's biggest scams ever			1
the " 2g scam , " as it is known in @entity1 , involves telecommunications minister @entity30 underselling mobile phone licenses in the world 's fastest growing mobile phone market			1
the leaked audio tapes recorded in 2009 reveal lobbyist @entity36 asking senior journalists @entity37 , group editor of leading news channel @entity40 , and @entity41 , advisory editorial director of the @entity43 , to mediate with the ruling @entity44 about cabinet posts			2
the tapes suggest @entity36 was lobbying for the continuation of @entity30 's post as telecommunications minister after the 2009 elections and both journalists agreed to help			1
@entity1 auditors say this cost the country some $ 40 billion in lost revenues as the mobile phone licenses were sold at prices set in 2001 under @entity30 's watch			1
@entity30 was forced to resign last month , but the 2g scam has put parliament in a logjam for the past two weeks as recriminations fly across party lines			0
while allegations of corruption are commonplace in @entity1 , revelations that some of @entity1 's most influential journalists were involved have shocked the public			1
@entity37 is known as the ' @entity17 ' and @entity68 is a widely - read columnist			1
" it 's very , very disappointing			2
neither of them is corrupt , nobody is saying they are corrupt			0
but corruption when it involves ethics is worse then taking money , " senior political journalist @entity74 told @entity2			0
some 104 tapes have been leaked and are now widely available on the internet			0
the transcripts were first published in two @entity1 magazines , which sourced them to audio recordings submitted recently to the @entity85 as part of the 2g scam			1
while the recordings feature many conversations , the focus has been on @entity36 's multiple conversations with @entity37 and @entity41			1
in one conversation , @entity37 says to @entity93 , " what do you want me to tell them ( @entity44 ) ? tell me , i 'll talk to them			0
" in another recording , @entity41 tells @entity99 he can offer a fully scripted and rehearsed tv interview for @entity1 's wealthiest man @entity101			1
@entity36 's public relations firm represents @entity101 's @entity103 and the @entity104			1
" when i started out as journalist in @entity0 , the government had other ways of controlling the media			2
it used to be by giving free houses and other freebies like trips with the prime minister			0
now they are controlling access			0
so if journalists cooperate , they are given exclusive access to information , vip parties and this is most worrying , " @entity74 said			2
one of the recordings also features @entity36 's conversation with the head of @entity1 's largest conglomerate , @entity125			1
@entity125 petitioned the @entity85 on monday to bar further dissemination of the tapes , contending the leakage has infringed upon his fundamental right to privacy			2
" we have somewhat slipped into a morass of series of allegations ... unauthorized tapes flooding ... the media going crazy on alleging , convicting , executing ... literally character assassination ... stop this sort of @entity141 kind of attack , " @entity125 said in a statement			2
while both @entity37 and @entity41 have not denied the authenticity of the recordings , they both maintain they were simply placating a source for news gathering purposes and believe they have done no wrong			0
in a @entity155 post , @entity37 said : " unless we only cover news based on bland press conferences , we have to talk to all sorts , good and bad , i think there is nothing wrong in stringing along a source for info ... i think every journo has the right to engage a source , its no crime ... as a matter of record , i never passed the message			0
but info sharing per se is not immoral in a fluid news situation			0
" other senior journalists believe the @entity1 media is facing a crisis of credibility			1
" the feedback i 'm getting is nobody trusts us journalists anymore , " @entity74 said			0
" @entity176 and @entity41 are very good friends of mine , i still continue to respect them			0
but i just wish they had said sorry and ended it there			0
@entity1 has 300 television channels , most of them in very rural areas			2
if this is happening in @entity0 just look at the consequences lower down			0
