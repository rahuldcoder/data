-- @entity1 are predicting big wins in the november midterms			1
across the aisle , democrats are saying the same thing about their chances at the polls			0
but both ca n't be right			0
@entity1 speculate that they will take back the @entity10 -- and possibly the @entity11 -- as voters express their frustration at where @entity4 and president @entity14 are taking the country			1
" i think it 's pretty clear that the @entity20 people are tired of the job - killing agenda in @entity23 they want the spending spree to stop , " @entity10 minority leader @entity16 said on " @entity17			1
" " i think we 're having a good year , but we 've got a lot of work to do before the @entity28 on november 2 , " he said			1
@entity16 advised @entity1 heading home for the august recess to " talk about the better solutions that @entity1 have been offering over the last 18 months			1
" his counterpart in the @entity10 , speaker @entity32 , encouraged her members to do the opposite			1
" we 've been legislating for the past 18 months			0
the other side has been in campaign mode for 18 months , saying no , stopping job creation and the rest			0
but our members are the best salespersons for their own districts			0
they 've been elected there			0
they know their constituents , " she said on @entity45 's " @entity44			0
" sen. @entity48 , a @entity49 from @entity50 , said that although his party will probably lose a couple of seats , " it 's going to be a lot better than what people now look at			2
" @entity4 hold a 256 - 179 advantage in the @entity10 and a 59 - 41 advantage in the @entity11 , including the two independents who caucus with @entity4			1
this year , 37 seats are up for grabs in the @entity11 , and 18 of those are considered at least somewhat vulnerable , according to the @entity63 , a nonpartisan newsletter covering campaigns and politics			1
eleven of those are held by @entity4 , and seven are held by @entity1			1
in the @entity10 , all 435 seats are on the ballot , and 88 are considered vulnerable , according to @entity63			1
twelve are held by @entity1 , and 76 are held by @entity4			1
in order to net control , @entity1 need to pick up 39 seats in the @entity10 and 10 in the @entity11 , said @entity75 , political editor of the @entity63			1
" the most likely scenario is the @entity1 gain 28 to 33 seats -- but the @entity10 is definitely in play			1
the majority is at significant risk for @entity4 , " @entity75 said			2
in the @entity11 , however , @entity1 have a tougher task			1
" republicans need to win every competitive race in order to take the majority			0
it 's possible but difficult , " @entity75 said			0
although the election is still three months out , the trajectory of the cycle is not going to change , @entity75 added			0
" republicans will gain seats in november			2
we just do n't know how many yet , " he said			0
@entity10 press secretary @entity94 had some fellow @entity4 fuming last month over his take on the midterms			1
" i think there 's no doubt there are enough seats in play that could cause republicans to gain control			1
there 's no doubt about that , " he told @entity108 's " meet the press			0
" asked sunday about those comments , @entity32 said , " with all due respect , i do n't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what the president 's employees say about one thing or another			2
" " we have a solid plan of messaging and mobilizing at the grass - roots level and management of our campaigns			0
and we have a two - to - one advantage money-wise			0
so we feel very confident about where we are , whether that 's well known to that gentleman or not , " she said			2
after facing backlash from @entity4 , @entity94 revised his prediction and said the party will hold on to the @entity10 and @entity11			1
a @entity132 poll indicates that @entity4 and @entity1 are tied on which party can bring the kind of change the country needs			1
the @entity1 hold an 8 - point margin over the @entity4 on the question of which party shares the respondents ' view of the government and which party can effectively manage the government			1
" these results illustrate the reasons why the @entity4 are now behind on the so - called generic ballot question , " @entity0 polling director @entity144 said			2
" the @entity4 manage no better than a virtual tie on issues , but they are behind when it comes to handling the government			2
and when the presidency is not at stake , the congressional elections are the only way that voters can do something about the direction the government will take			0
" full results of the poll ( @entity162 ) a potential thorn for @entity4 is the ethics cases dogging two @entity10 members			1
@entity167 rep. @entity166 has chosen to face a @entity10 ethics trial rather than accept a finding of wrongdoing by the @entity171 , according to a source familiar with the process			2
the ethics committee has been looking into whether @entity175 violated @entity10 rules when she helped arrange a meeting in september 2008 between @entity179 officials and a bank she and her husband had ties to financially			2
longtime rep. @entity183 also could face an ethics trial , barring a settlement between him and the committee members			0
the @entity171 last week accused @entity183 , a @entity187 @entity49 , of 13 violations of @entity10 rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of @entity191			2
@entity192 , editor of conservative magazine @entity193 , said @entity1 would be " foolish " to jump on the ethics problems because they are not unique to the @entity4			1
" they should just shut up			0
there 's a bipartisan ethics committee			0
let the process go forward , " he told @entity17			0
" democrats are going to lose the @entity10 and suffer the loss of a lot of @entity11 seats because of their policies , " @entity192 said			1
" and the idea that @entity1 should go around throwing stones at @entity183 , i think , is just foolish on their part			2
" lawmakers are entering the most crucial part of the campaign season , when candidates start to engage each other and their messages begin to stick with voters			0
but as the clich√© goes , three months is an eternity in politics			0
" i 'd love to have the election tomorrow , but obviously it 's not tomorrow , " senate minority leader @entity217 told @entity17 when asked whether anything short of a @entity1 takeover could be considered a victory for @entity4			1
" if the election were today , we 'd certainly have a good day , but it 's a long way until november			2
they have a lot of money			0
they 've outspent us for the last three cycles , and i expect them to do it again			0
they 're not going to go down easily , " @entity232 said .			0

" i think we 're having a good year , " @entity10 minority leader @entity16 says
" @entity237 is definitely in play , " political *observer* says
house speaker @entity32 says @entity4 " feel very confident about where we are "
to gain control , @entity1 need to pick up 39 seats in the @entity10 , 10 in the @entity11
