@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity3 sculptor has created a mystery at @entity0 's @entity6 gallery by refusing to reveal how she seemingly managed to crack open a concrete floor			1
" @entity11 " is @entity3 artist @entity9 's first public commission in the @entity10			1
the work by @entity9 begins as a hairline crack then widens and deepens as it snakes across the full 167 meters ( 548 feet ) of the former power station 's @entity14			1
@entity9 said " @entity11 , " a statement about racism , took her more than a year to make but has revealed little else about its construction			1
she apparently created it elsewhere and spent the past five weeks installing it in the @entity22 , on the south bank of the @entity24			2
she refused to say how she managed seemingly to crack open a concrete floor			1
" what is important is the meaning of the piece			0
the making of it is not important , " she said			0
asked how deep the crack goes , she replied : " it 's bottomless			1
it 's as deep as humanity			2
" visitors meanwhile are warned not to trip on the crack			2
@entity22 director @entity37 insisted the work was no optical illusion			0
" this sculpture has been made in the most painstaking , meticulous way by @entity9 and her team before it was slowly inserted into the @entity14 , " he told the @entity40			2
" it has taken five weeks of work here with very considerable disruption to the hall			0
it 's not an illusion - it 's there , it 's real			0
" from the @entity22 's point of view , there were only two questions : could we realize it in the way @entity9 envisaged ? and once the piece was created , would it damage the structural integrity of the building forever ? " the answer to the first was yes , and to the second was no. " he declined to elaborate further			1
the installation will be removed next april by filling in the crack			0
@entity37 said : " there is a crack , there is a line , and eventually there will be a scar and that scar will remain			0
it will remain as a memory of the work and also as a memorial to the issues @entity9 touches on			1
" the artist said the work of art represents the gap between white @entity82 and the rest of humanity			1
wire mesh is on show because it is " the most common means of control used to define borders and divisions			0
" @entity9 said of the work : " it represents borders , the experience of immigrants , the experience of segregation , the experience of racial hatred			1
" it is the experience of a @entity100 person coming into the heart of @entity82			2
" for example , the space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space			0
and so this piece is a negative space			0
