just when you thought there were no more air - fare bargains left to be found online ... customers cruising @entity5 ' website for tickets on thursday got a pleasant surprise			1
as reported by @entity12 , air fares between cities such as @entity10 and @entity11 were being sold on the site for $ 0 to $ 10			2
ticket prices on other domestic routes were displayed as $ 0 , plus $ 5 tax			2
@entity17 quickly spread around the @entity18 and savvy buyers scooped up untold numbers of the dream tickets before @entity5 spotted the error			1
the $ 0 fare and other wildly reduced fares appear to have been available for about 15 minutes , before @entity5 shut down its online reservations system , reporting that its site was undergoing maintenance			1
" one of our filings today contained an error which resulted in certain fares being displayed as zero			0
we have corrected this error , " said @entity5 in a statement that also blamed human error for the mistake			1
the site has since resumed normal operations			0
the tickets are sold , now what ? the question now : will @entity5 honor the erroneously priced tickets ? sales of airline tickets based on erroneous fares are nothing new			2
in 2012 , as reported by @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity5 and @entity46 all wrangled with the problem			0
some believe companies should stand by their sales and accept the consequences of their own mistakes			0
others say airlines should n't be held accountable for honest mistakes			0
@entity5 has yet to issue a statement regarding its plans on whether or not to honor the tickets sold at mistaken fares			0
should @entity5 honor the tickets it sold thursday for $ 0 , $ 5 and $ 10 ? leave a comment below .			1

customers bought $ 0 fare tickets on @entity5 ' website
buyers spread the word before @entity5 corrected the error in about 15 minutes
