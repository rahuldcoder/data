-- the tale of @entity2 , the @entity3 mother who abandoned her two children only to turn up in @entity5 11 years later , has taken another unlikely turn			1
on saturday , she remained jailed on a @entity9 warrant for alleged violation of probation , forgery and giving a false name to law enforcement , said @entity15 , a spokesman for the @entity16			1
@entity2 , who used the assumed name @entity18 , is awaiting extradition , @entity15 told @entity0 affiliate @entity20			1
she turned herself in friday			1
heist , meanwhile , may not have spent most of those 11 years homeless , as she told police last week when she turned herself in , saying she 'd abandoned her family because of stress			1
@entity25 says she knew @entity2 in 2010			1
at that time , @entity2 cleaned her @entity5 home and went by the name @entity28			1
" she actually moved in with me , moved in with me about six months after she started cleaning the house , " @entity25 told @entity0 's " @entity30 " on friday			2
heist first came into her life through a neighbor , who recommended her when @entity25 was looking for a housekeeper			1
the neighbor had used her as a babysitter and spoke highly of her , she said			2
at first , the two women shared small talk , but little more on @entity2 's weekly visit to clean			1
but over time their conversations took on a different , more personal tone			2
" she told me that she had a bad relationship with her boyfriend and i started to kind of feel bad for her , " @entity25 said			2
" she described it as sort of an abusive situation , saying that he was maybe an alcoholic and i just let her know that my door was always open for her			2
i felt bad for her			2
" @entity25 asked more questions about @entity2 's past when she moved into the house , " but not a whole lot			1
but when i did ask , she made it clear that she never had kids and she did n't want any			2
" @entity2 also claimed to be a widow			1
" she said she had been married for , like , 20 years to a man named @entity59 and he had worked for the @entity60 and they had traveled around and visited amazing places and he had died , " @entity25 said			2
' absolutely shocked ' after she moved in , bringing some belongings with her , @entity2 lived with her for 10 or 11 months			1
she used the computer and cell phone , had a @entity67 page and was on an internet dating site , @entity25 said			2
" she had friends outside of me			2
" heist 's appearance then was nothing like the worn - down face shown in pictures taken after she turned herself in last week to authorities in @entity76 , @entity5			1
" i was absolutely shocked when i saw that photo , " @entity25 said			2
" she has deteriorated significantly since the last time she was seen around here , which was , you know , the middle of 2012 , the end of 2012			2
that 's not been very long , you know , seven months or so			2
" another twist in the tale is that @entity2 had revealed her true last name to @entity25 's son , with whom she became close while living in the family home			1
he was around the same age as @entity2 's own son was when she abandoned her @entity3 family nearly a decade earlier			1
@entity25 had taken her son aside to tell him the truth about the woman he knew as " miss @entity28 , " so that he would n't learn about it on the news			0
but he told her he already knew her last name was @entity2			1
" i was stunned that he knew that			0
but for a little boy , that 's kind of a cool last name			0
i said , honey , how did you know that ? ' miss @entity28 told me			0
' " no family reunion but while @entity2 was making friends and living an apparently normal life in @entity5 , the husband , son and daughter she 'd left behind in 2002 continued to wonder whether something terrible had happened to her			1
police searched for her for years , at one point creating a cold case task force			1
her family remain angry over the pain her disappearance caused			0
" i do n't think she deserves to see me , " her 20 - year - old daughter @entity122 told @entity0 's " @entity124 " on thursday night			0
" i do n't really have any plans on going to see her			0
" the fact that her mother -- who she last saw when she was 8 -- never even called has left her seething , @entity122 said			0
the anger is captured in a post on the daughter 's @entity133 page that reads she hopes her mother " rots in hell			0
" " that makes me really mad , " @entity122 said			0
" i ca n't believe she would do that because she was a good mom			0
but , i mean , i guess something happened			0
" her father , @entity139 , said he is not planning on visiting his ex-wife anytime soon			0
they were going through a divorce at the time she disappeared , and he was treated for a time as a suspect in her disappearance , though he was eventually cleared			1
in 2010 , he filed a petition with the county court to have @entity2 declared legally deceased , according to a @entity151 police news release			1
he was seeking closure , he said			0
" i do n't see where it would do any good for either of us to see her again , " @entity139 said			0
he later remarried and said he will learn to forgive his former wife			0
but for @entity122 , forgiving her mom may not be easy			0
" i hope to eventually forgive her one day for myself , not for her , " she said			0
left on a whim @entity2 vanished in february 2002 after last being seen dropping off her children at school			1
she was applying for housing assistance so that she could get an apartment after the breakdown of her marriage			0
she worked as a bookkeeper for a car dealer and hoped to receive some financial aid			0
however , her request was denied , police said			2
" she was very upset , she was sitting in a park crying , thinking about how she would raise her children , feeling sorry for herself , " said sgt. @entity171 , a @entity172 , @entity3 , police detective			1
he was one of the many officers who searched for @entity2			1
by her account , it was n't long before she was approached by two men and a woman who asked her what was wrong			0
after she told them what had happened , they invited her to hitchhike with them down to @entity5			1
" at a whim , she decided at that very moment , she would go along with them , " @entity171 said			0
@entity171 spoke to heist at length after she turned herself in			1
" she was very emotional ; she hung her head ; she 's ashamed			0
she was crying when i met with her			0
she knows what she did was completely wrong , but all that while , she 'd never made one effort to call or contact her family at all , " @entity171 said			0
heist told police she spent the first two years homeless , living under bridges , eating food thrown out by restaurants after they closed			1
for the next seven years , she lived in a camper with a man she had met			0
they made money as day laborers , cleaning boats and doing other odd jobs for which they did n't have to show @entity208 and were paid in cash			0
after that relationship soured , @entity171 said , she said she lived on the street again for another two years			0
but the revelations made by @entity25 raise new questions over the truth of @entity2 's account			1
" i do n't think we know the full story yet , " @entity171 told @entity0 's " @entity30 " on friday			0
" the facts are she left , she turned her back on her family			2
she started a new life down in @entity5 ... whether she lived homeless or whether she lived a wonderful life as a live - in housekeeper , i do n't think that was for the 11 years , that was just for the last few years here			1
" @entity171 said heist is still looking at charges for false ids , thefts and possession of drugs and drugs paraphernalia in @entity5			1
there also may be false @entity208 and theft charges to face in @entity3 , he said			1
she never suspected heist of using drugs , @entity25 said -- or she would not have allowed her near her family			2
