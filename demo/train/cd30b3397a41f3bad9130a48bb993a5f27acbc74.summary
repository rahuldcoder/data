-- the @entity1 rolls muddy and wide beneath a gray , spitting sky			2
the @entity4 , symbol of the once unimaginable promise of the nation 's westward expansion , looms above the barges pushing past and the summer traffic below			2
across the water , at 35 years old , @entity12 is staring at the skyline and wondering what has happened to her future			2
" i thought i 'd be more successful right now , " she says , " have better health insurance , better ( working ) conditions , just better everything , because i 'm in @entity20			1
" we 're supposed to have better quality everything here , but we do n't			2
" @entity25 is a forklift operator at a warehouse and one of the countless working @entity20 struggling with the long , slow economic recovery , characterized by the latest jobs report , which once again shows unemployment above 7 %			1
the rate has not dipped below that number since november 2008 , two months before @entity32 became president			1
his defenders point out that the nose dive in jobs began under president @entity39 ; his detractors counter that @entity32 has not exactly proven a wizard at reversing the trend			2
forget the politics : the bottom line is that sustained unemployment of more than 7 % is wreaking havoc in ways that many economists fear are being overlooked as the nation grows numb to the dreadful monthly numbers			1
" it 's a total employers ' market , " says @entity51 , a senior economist at the progressive @entity52			1
he argues that the first and foremost effect is an erosion of the bargaining positions for workers everywhere			2
" if you are looking for a job , you take whatever is offered			1
if you have a job , you do n't complain			1
if wages are going to be frozen , if benefits are going to be cut , you suck it up			2
there 's not much you can do			2
" other profound changes emerging from the 7 % landscape : the @entity69 reports four times as many workers are now being offered temporary or part - time positions than full - time jobs ; reports have abounded for many months about how even the full - time positions now do n't pay as well as those lost in the @entity77			1
certainly , president @entity32 is sensitive to all that			2
he has been barnstorming the country in recent weeks leading sing - along choruses of " @entity83 , " the song that got him re-elected			2
but aside from the politics , there are practical reasons he , his @entity87 , and @entity88 , too , need to see the 7 % floor broken , and soon			1
as @entity51 puts it , " seven out of a hundred workers that would like to have a job do n't have one			1
that 's an enormous amount of lost resources in the economy			0
that means people are n't producing goods and services , are n't consuming goods and services			0
... " and they are n't paying taxes			0
at least not at the rate that governments require to keep up with benefits for a population trying to claw out of an economic hole			1
that 's why , back in @entity111 , mayor @entity110 gets agitated over people growing accustomed to such a high unemployment rate			1
" for people to accept that as the norm would be very , very dangerous , " he tells me as we sit in the office of @entity111 county executive @entity118 , who chimes in			0
" i think it is not the @entity20 way of life			1
we can do better than that			0
we 've got to continue to invest in our infrastructure			0
you 've got to have amenities			0
" and both men know , you ca n't do any of that with a crippling unemployment rate hanging around year after year			1
@entity131 , by the way , has a current unemployment rate just under 7 % , but across the river in @entity134 , it 's over 9 %			1
to be sure , some progress is being made			0
look at the charts from the @entity137 and you 'll see creeping improvements in the jobs numbers over the past few years			0
but the @entity141 in its spring report said while most states are no longer teetering on the edge of economic calamity , there is still " a dose of uncertainty , as states continue to plod their way through an extended economic recovery			0
" what everyone wants , of course , is " full employment			0
" that 's a term economists do n't like much because while it describes a simple idea ( everyone who wants a job has one ) , the details are squishy			1
for starters , " full employment " does not and will never mean 0 % unemployment			1
people are always changing jobs , looking for new positions , or taking breaks , so some percentage of the population is expected to be out of work at any given time			0
furthermore , some economists -- not many , but some -- believe that whenever an unemployment rate stabilizes for a period of years at any number , like say 7 % or above , that is by definition " full employment " because the economy is essentially " full " of workers or it would hire more			1
@entity180 , however , is not one of them			0
" i have a lot of problems with that			0
" @entity180 is a distinguished professor of economics at @entity187 in @entity188 , who has written and researched extensively into the causes and effects of unemployment			1
" before the recession , ( full employment ) was typically estimated to be in the range of 4 to 6 %			2
since the recession , there are indications that number may have gone up			0
my own estimates suggest it is somewhere between 5 and perhaps a little bit over 6 % now , although nowhere near 7 or 7Â½ %			1
" the ways in which those numbers can change are complicated			0
imagine a chalkboard filled with elaborate , baffling equations and you 'll get the gist even if you do n't get the picture			0
but it all comes down to the idea that 7 % is not even close to " full employment " in the eyes of most economists , and some parts of the population are disastrously far from even that mark			1
last year , for example , @entity219 - @entity20 males faced an unemployment rate of 15 %			1
and here is the thing : young workers -- all those bright - eyed , optimistic kids with their iphones -- who are being pounded by the employment situation now , will likely never recover from the beating			0
read that again : they will never recover			0
" there is evidence that entering a troubled labor market has a permanent scarring effect , " @entity180 says			1
" somebody who enters a labor market during a downturn , they 're going to see lower wages throughout their career			2
" all that is the damning legacy of that stubborn 7 % - plus that keeps coming out each month			1
blame whomever you wish politically , but even if the number has started looking benign after all these months , there is no denying the economic tidal wave rumbling beneath it			0
even now , it is washing around @entity12 , as she stands on the riverbank while her friend @entity249 roams up			0
he is 27 , works in a factory and has a strategy for economic survival : " @entity254 got to try to keep your head up high and save all you can , if you can			0
" she smiles and turns back to the river			0
until that number changes , it is as good a plan as any .			0

the @entity20 unemployment rate has *stalled* at more than 7 %
@entity264 : economists say sustained unemployment is wreaking havoc
economist : youths entering the job market will be *affected* for their entire working lives
