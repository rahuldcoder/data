@entity0 , @entity1 -- the search in a field near @entity6 for @entity8 boss @entity7 ended wednesday , and as with so many past attempts to find him , authorities walked away empty - handed , the @entity3 said			1
authorities resumed digging in the field wednesday morning , and a law enforcement source said the search was expanded to a site where a house once stood			2
@entity18 , a former @entity3 special agent involved in the original 1975 hunt for @entity7 , said the tip from alleged mobster @entity21 which prompted this week 's renewed search was the most credible he 's heard since @entity7 's disappearance -- though he still has his reservations , he said			1
@entity18 said he 's skeptical of @entity21 's claim that @entity7 was killed with a shovel because it was n't the way of organized crime members in those days , who @entity18 said would have preferred to shoot him in the head at close range			1
asked if it was possible @entity21 was coming forward for monetary reasons , @entity18 said , " i think there 's no doubt about that			0
that 's why he came out in january with this story on the insistence of his wife			0
" vanishing act : the long , strange search for @entity7 a second day of digging in the field tuesday yielded no sign of the remains of the former @entity49 boss			2
agents began digging monday in waist - high grass in @entity0 , north of @entity6 , a location determined in part from information provided by @entity21			1
media and curious onlookers gathered some distance from the private property			0
@entity0 sheriff @entity59 said investigators were using probes to determine what the ground makeup is , but had not found samples that would require lab analysis			2
two concrete slabs were removed during the dig. it 's unclear whether the slabs were foundations for a barn that once stood there			1
scientists from @entity74 were at the site tuesday to help with soil analysis			0
this is the latest chapter of the nearly four - decade search for @entity7			1
it was sparked by " highly credible " information from @entity21 , according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation			0
earlier this year , @entity21 , now in his 80s , told @entity86 's @entity85 that @entity7 was buried in a @entity1 field about 20 miles north of where he was last seen in 1975			1
@entity7 , then 62 , disappeared after being seen on july 30 , 1975 , outside a @entity6 - area restaurant			1
the @entity3 said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to @entity7 's efforts to regain power in the @entity49 and to the mob 's influence over the union 's pension funds			1
@entity21 's attorney , @entity98 , told reporters monday that @entity21 was told @entity7 was hit with a shovel and buried alive			2
@entity7 still fascinates after 40 years @entity21 published a manuscript about the @entity7 claim online that includes details of the alleged hit			1
" he was n't shot , he was n't stabbed , nothing like that			0
a cement slab of some sort was placed on top of the dirt to make certain he was not going to be discovered			0
end of story , " @entity21 's manuscript says			0
the @entity3 spent months looking into @entity21 's claims before seeking court authorization to excavate the field and look for evidence of a shallow grave , according to a law enforcement source			1
contrary to what 's been thought for years , @entity21 said he was told @entity7 's disappearance was not connected to @entity123 , the @entity86 - area @entity124 crime boss who allegedly wanted to get rid of @entity7			1
instead , according to the source , @entity21 -- convicted years ago of crimes in connection with organized crime in @entity6 -- told the @entity3 that @entity6 mobsters wanted @entity7 dead			1
at the time , @entity7 was thought to be trying to get back into a power position with the labor movement after his release from prison			2
he was convicted in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud			0
president @entity137 pardoned him in 1971			0
@entity21 was in prison himself when @entity7 disappeared			2
@entity21 , according to the law enforcement source , said that when he was freed , he asked a mob enforcer what happened to @entity7			1
the mobster allegedly told @entity21 that @entity6 's crime bosses ordered the @entity7 hit			1
they lured him to a meeting and then drove him to a farm owned by a mob underboss			0
the enforcer allegedly told @entity21 that @entity7 was killed and buried on the property , which covers several acres			2
the area being searched was described as relatively small , about the size of a small party tent , according to the source			2
aerial video showed a somewhat larger area had been cleared of grass			0
@entity21 has been to the site more than once , said @entity98 , who declined to elaborate			0
@entity7 's daughter , @entity159 , told @entity2 by phone tuesday that she is always appreciative when the @entity3 follows credible leads in the case			1
but , she said , she does n't want to get her hopes up			0
" we 've been through it too many times , " she said			0
@entity3 special agent @entity167 , head of the agency 's @entity6 office , told @entity2 at the scene that the information leading to the search " reached the threshold of probable cause , which was sufficient to allow us to obtain a search warrant			1
" the paperwork supporting the search warrant is under seal			0
" if it did n't rise to that level then , certainly , we would n't be out here , " @entity167 said			0
@entity7 's disappearance and presumed death have vexed investigators			2
as recently as october , soil samples were taken from a home in a suburban @entity6 community after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried in the yard a day after @entity7 disappeared			1
the soil samples were tested , and showed no evidence of human remains or decomposition			0
@entity21 was freed in 2008 after his last prison sentence			0
@entity197 , a former @entity198 attorney , told @entity2 earlier this year that @entity21 headed a @entity6 organized crime family from 1970 to 1975 , but was in prison when @entity7 vanished			1
@entity2 's @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 contributed to this report .			0
