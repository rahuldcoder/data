-- @entity1 has passed a controversial new law which will see the country 's 500 most - polluting companies pay tax on their carbon emissions			1
the @entity7 was passed by 36 votes to 32 in the @entity9 on tuesday and will come into force on july 1 next year			1
the legislation sees carbon taxed at a fixed price of 23 @entity14 dollars ( $ 23.7 ) per ton for three years before moving to flexible pricing in 2015			1
in a statement on the prime minister 's official website , @entity16 described the vote as " history - making " and " a major milestone in @entity1 's efforts to cut carbon pollution and seize the economic and job opportunities of the future			1
" the legislation , which passed through @entity1 's @entity29 by 74 votes to 72 in october , will deliver cuts in carbon pollution of at least 160 million tons a year in 2020 , according to @entity16 's website			2
nine out of 10 households will receive compensation to offset the expected rises in energy bills caused by the legislation , say the government			0
this will take the form of a mixture of tax cuts and extra family benefits funded in part by the revenues the government collects from the businesses affected			0
but opposition leader @entity49 , a staunch opponent of the legislation , called it " a betrayal of the @entity14 people " adding that three million @entity14 households will be worse off because of the tax			1
" the longer this tax is in place , the worse the consequences for the economy , jobs and families			0
it will drive up the cost of living , threaten jobs and do nothing for the environment , " @entity49 , leader of the @entity61 in @entity1 said in a statement on his website			1
@entity49 also pledged to repeal the tax should he win the next general election scheduled to take place in 2013			0

but the @entity87 , whose support ensured @entity16 's minority government won the vote , said the new law promised a greener future			2
