-- the announcement that @entity2 , @entity3 , will not host the 2016 @entity4 took the hopeful wind out of many in the @entity2			1
dreams of hosting the @entity8 were dashed for many @entity9			0
but for others , the news was welcome			0
but for almost half of the city 's dwellers , the @entity13 's decision was winning news			1
a spokeswoman for @entity19 , a grass - roots organization opposed to hosting the @entity4 , said she was " relieved " by the vote friday in @entity22 , @entity23			2
@entity2 's @entity4 fever , spotty as it was , broke abruptly when the city was the first of four final contenders to be knocked out of the running			1
the prospective host cities had been whittled down to four finalists -- @entity2 ; @entity31 , @entity32 ; @entity33 , @entity34 ; and @entity35 , @entity36			1
the bid went to @entity31 , making it the first @entity39 city to host the @entity4			1
@entity2 had been seen as a front - runner in recent days , especially after it sent to @entity42 's biggest guns -- president @entity43 and his popular wife , @entity44 -- for a last - minute sales pitch			1
but a poll taken by the @entity47 and @entity0 affiliate @entity48 revealed in early september that 45 percent of the city residents did n't want the @entity4			2
and 84 percent of @entity9 objected to the idea of public money being used to support the effort			0
earlier this week , about 250 olympic - bid protesters gathered in front of @entity55 , @entity48 reported			1
a sign in the crowd read : " have the audacity of nope			0
" many who gathered for the bid slapdown were affiliated with @entity19 , which sent three delegates to @entity22 to state their case			0
after the vote , however , spokeswoman @entity64 said @entity19 is " in no way taking any pleasure in this " and feels " sympathy " for those who are disappointed			0
" in reality , @entity9 who were for the @entity4 and those who were against them were committed to the same goal : working hard for what they thought would be best for the city of @entity2 in the coming decades , " she said			1
" we 're glad that the city wo n't now be burdened by the distraction of the @entity4 at the expense of improving @entity2 's schools , transportation , parks and the numerous other public policy initiatives on which the city needs to be focused			1
" those who believe the @entity4 can bring lasting change to a city -- beyond the spike in economic activity during the event -- are often misguided , suggested economist @entity92 of @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity3			2
" there is no reason to expect that the @entity4 , or any mega-event , is going to induce a sustainable boost in the economy , " he said			0
" the cost overruns are pretty legendary			0
costs are generally understated and the gains overstated			0
" one web site set up to rally against bringing the @entity4 to town relied as much on humor as it did reason			0
the site showcased unflattering head - to - head comparisons , such as " naked people dancing " vs. " @entity113 people eating			0
" the increasing budget deficit in @entity2 was contrasted with a $ 0 total for @entity31			1
" if you 're a @entity119 , @entity31 's budget deficit does not matter , " the site said			2
" it would be exciting to host the @entity4 here in @entity2			1
but you know what would be even better ? @entity31 , " the site announced			0
" just let @entity31 host the @entity8			2

for about half of @entity2 's dwellers , *losing* out on the @entity4 is welcome news
@entity4 *opponents* prefer the city 's focus to be on schools and other needs
about 250 *anti-olympic* protesters rallied outside @entity2 's @entity55 this week
@entity31 , @entity32 , wins bid , making it the first @entity39 host city
