50 reasons why @entity5 is the world 's greatest city in the more low - key @entity3 , a night out usually means drinking soju with friends on the beach while watching kids play with firecrackers			1
or eating hoe ( @entity20 sashimi ) -- again with soju -- at the shiny new fish market			0
or watching burly , tattooed local men ( widely considered more manly than their @entity5 counterparts ) play a popular street game , driving nails with a single blow into a thick wooden beam , for prizes of cigarettes and whiskey			1
even apart from the prevalence of seafood , the cuisine in @entity3 is also different from that found in the rest of the country			1
here 's what to do in @entity7 's second city			1
beaches @entity42 during the summer swim season -- it runs from july 1 to august 31 each year -- millions of @entity44 , and increasingly more foreign visitors , descend on this strip of beach and revel in the water before heading out to party on weekend nights			1
just in front of the beach is the @entity53 street , a strip of identical , tented seafood stalls selling everything from live octopus to lobster			0
customers pick their own meal from a tank and minutes later have it cooked and served to them alongside their favorite @entity3 soju			0
