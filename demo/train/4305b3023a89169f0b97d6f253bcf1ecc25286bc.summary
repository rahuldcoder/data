-- the primary cause for hundreds of recent dolphin deaths along the @entity4 is likely a virus , and there 's no way to stop its spread right now , federal officials say			1
the virus , the cetacean morbillivirus , is similar to measles in humans or canine distemper in dogs , according to the @entity15			1
after consulting with disease experts and conducting tests from five affected states , @entity15 found that 32 dolphins were either " suspect or confirmed positive for mobillivirus			1
" the five affected states are @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
@entity27 has also seen an increase in dolphin strandings , according to @entity15			1
as of sunday , there have been 488 dolphin strandings from @entity22 to @entity27 , more than 300 dolphins above the annual average			1
the strandings , where dolphins have gotten stuck in shallow water or have washed up on shores , are over nine times the historical average for july and august in the @entity39			1
some stranded are found alive , but most are found dead , with many in a state of advanced decomposition , according to data published on @entity15 's website			2
in @entity26 , at least 164 dead dolphins have been found this year , said @entity47 , public relations manager for the @entity48 in @entity49			0
seventy - eight have washed ashore so far in august , she said			0
there is no vaccination for the mobillivirus , but additional testing on other animals is underway			0
scientists at the @entity15 hope that learning more about the virus will help them address factors that may facilitate its spread			2
while the virus is generally spread through the air or through contact with other animals , it is not infectious to humans			0
on august 8 , @entity15 issued an @entity65 in response to the high number of deaths			2
the declaration brought special federal attention to the deaths as something that serves as an indicator of ocean health and may give " insight into larger environmental issues which may also have implications for human health and welfare , " according to @entity15 's website			0
the @entity65 declaration for the @entity39 bottlenose dolphins is one of 60 that the agency has issued since it was established under the @entity85 in 1991			0
causes , including infections , biotoxins , human intervention and malnutrition , have been determined for the 29 of those cases			0
