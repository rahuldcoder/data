-- on thursday , president @entity1 is scheduled to deliver a major speech in @entity3 about his administration 's counterterrorism policies , focusing on the rationale and legal framework for the controversial @entity9 drone program and his plans to wind down the prison camp at @entity12			1
so we thought it might be useful to examine some common myths about the drone program and the prison population at @entity12			1
drone strikes largely target the leaders of terrorist groups that threaten the @entity21			1
in fact , of the thousands who have been killed in @entity9 drone strikes in @entity24 , only 37 were leaders of @entity26 or affiliated organizations , according to a tally by the @entity29			2
and even if we add to that list the leaders of the @entity34 who have been killed in drone strikes , only 2 % of the victims of the @entity9 strikes in @entity24 have been militant leaders			2
the drone program , which began more than a decade ago as a tool to kill leaders of terrorist groups , has evolved today into a counterinsurgency air force whose principal victims in @entity24 are lower - level members of the @entity34			1
drones , by the numbers 2			0
drone strikes target specific terrorists who pose some kind of imminent threat to the @entity21 @entity1 's top counterterrorism adviser and now @entity9 director @entity51 said in a speech last year that " in order to prevent terrorist attacks on the @entity21 and to save @entity21 lives -- the @entity21 government conducts targeted strikes against specific @entity26 terrorists			1
" that 's only partly true , because the @entity9 has also has occasionally conducted " signature strikes " against groups of men who display a particular behavioral " signature " that indicates they may be militants			1
in these cases , the targeter does not know the identity of the persons in the drone cross hairs			0
drone strikes kill a lot of civilians			0
that was certainly once the case			0
under president @entity84 , the proportion of those killed by drones in @entity24 who were identified in reliable news reports as civilians or " unknowns " -- people who were not identified definitively as either civilians or militants -- was around 40 % , according to data assembled by the @entity29			2
but the civilian and " unknown " casualty rate from drone strikes has fallen steadily over the life of the program			2
under @entity1 that number has fallen to 16 %			2
and in 2012 it was around 11 %			0
in 2012 , 2 % of the drones ' victims were characterized as civilians in news reports and 9 % were described in a manner that made it ambiguous whether they were militants or civilians			0
and in 2013 , civilian casualties are at their lowest ever			0
that is partly the result of a sharply reduced number of drone strikes in @entity24 -- 12 so far in 2013 , compared with a record 122 in 2010 -- and also more precise targeting			0
according to data collected by the @entity29 , three to five " unknown " individuals have been killed so far in drone strikes in 2013			0
two other organizations that track the @entity9 drone program in @entity24 , the @entity114 - based @entity113 and the @entity115 , report zero to four civilian deaths and 11 civilian deaths respectively			1
the @entity21 has no reason to worry about the legal framework governing drone strikes because it is so dominant in drone technology			1
only three countries currently are confirmed to possess armed drones -- @entity126 , the @entity127 and the @entity21 but some 80 countries have drones , according to a count by the @entity29 , and a number of them may already be able to arm them			1
in february , a @entity135 state - run newspaper reported that the @entity135 government had contemplated deploying an armed drone in a remote , mountainous area to kill a drug lord , but decided instead to capture him			0
@entity141 unveiled what it claimed was its first armed drone in 2010			0
during a speech last week at the @entity29 , the @entity145 special rapporteur for counterterrorism and human rights , @entity148 , estimated that " within a matter of certainly a year or two , other states will be deploying the technology , and within five years or so we will see a number of states and possibly nonstate actors deploying similar types of combat technology			0
" @entity148 also pointed out that the rapid proliferation of drone technology means whatever legal framework the @entity21 puts together to justify its targeted killing campaign " has to be a framework that we can live with if it is being used by @entity141 when it is deploying drones against @entity141 dissidents hiding inside the territory of @entity168 or @entity169 or @entity170			1
" a sobering and instructive thought			0
the @entity24 government gives a wink and a nod to the drone program , providing tacit approval for its continuation			1
it is true that @entity24 's president @entity179 quietly agreed to allow the @entity9 's targeted killing campaign to begin in 2004			1
but the program has become deeply controversial and unpopular in @entity24 because of the perception that it kills many civilians and that it erodes @entity24 's national sovereignty			2
in april 2012 , the @entity24 parliament voted unanimously to rescind any previous permission that had been granted by the government for the @entity9 to conduct the targeted killing program			0
during @entity148 's visit to @entity24 in march to discuss the @entity9 drone program with top officials , the point made to him " consistently , right across government , at the highest level and throughout , was that there is no continuing consent to the use of drones on @entity24 territory			1
" the next @entity24 prime minister , @entity200 , who was elected on may 11 with a clear mandate , has urged an end to the drone strikes , telling reporters , " drones indeed are challenging our sovereignty			2
of course we have taken this matter up very seriously			0
i think this is a very serious issue , and our concern must be understood properly			0
@entity1 is soft on terrorists			2
the @entity9 has conducted 355 drone strikes in @entity24 's tribal regions since the targeted killing program began there in 2004			1
the vast majority of these -- 307 to be precise -- were carried out under @entity1			2
even if you take the most conservative estimate of the numbers of people the @entity1 administration has killed in drone strikes in @entity24 , 1,600 , that is around twice the total number of prisoners that @entity84 sent to @entity12			1
many of the @entity12 detainees who have been released return to the battlefield			2
the @entity21 government claims that 27 % of those released from @entity12 are suspected or confirmed to have taken up arms			1
for security reasons the government has n't released the names of these men since 2009 , but a review of the public record suggests that number is quite inflated			0
according to a review by the @entity29 of news articles , @entity239 reports , and other relevant documents , of the 603 detainees who have been released from the prison , only 17 individuals ( 2.8 % ) are confirmed to have engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities against the @entity21 or its citizens , while 21 individuals ( 3.5 % ) are suspected of engaging in such activities			1
the detainees still held at @entity12 are too dangerous to release			1
some undoubtedly are , such as the operational commander of 9/11 , @entity250			0
but contrary to the fulminations of officials such as sen. @entity254 , @entity256 - @entity255 -- who said last year that @entity12 detainees are " crazy bastards that want to kill us all " -- half of the men still held at the prison camp were cleared for release three years ago by a task force of @entity264 and @entity239 officials			1
to be exact , 86 of the 166 men still imprisoned at @entity12 were either found to be guilty of nothing , or were low - level fighters who could be repatriated subject to some continued monitoring by their home country 's government			1
there are no benefits for the @entity21 to release additional prisoners from @entity12			1
@entity1 correctly said of @entity12 in april , " it is expensive			1
it hurts us in terms of our international standing			0
it lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts			0
it is a recruitment tool for extremists			0
it needs to be closed			0
" the cost per year to keep one prisoner at @entity12 is estimated to be $ 800,000 , more than 30 times the cost of keeping a prisoner in a jail in the @entity21			1
and the @entity239 is asking @entity293 to approve a $ 200 million renovation plan for the prison			0
the prisoners at @entity12 have also featured frequently in jihadist propaganda , making it a recruitment tool for would - be @entity26 members			2
there is also a way forward through @entity12 to obtaining some kind of peace deal with the @entity34			2
as a " confidence - building measure " for peace negotiations , @entity304 have agreed to release the only @entity21 prisoner of war , sgt. @entity307 , in exchange for a handful of senior @entity34 figures being held at @entity12 , who would then be held under some form of house arrest in the @entity315 state of @entity316			1
this deal is a precondition for continuing serious peace talks with the @entity34			0
the 27 - year - old soldier has been in captivity since the @entity34 seized him on june 30 , 2009 .			0

president @entity1 to speak thursday on drone program , @entity12
@entity326 says there are many *misconceptions* about both issues
he says idea that drones target leaders of anti- @entity21 terrorist groups is mostly not true
@entity336 : it 's a myth that all those at @entity12 are too dangerous to release
