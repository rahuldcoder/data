@entity0 -- the once - ubiquitous humvee may become a rare sight in some parts of @entity5 following a decision by the senior @entity8 commander in eastern @entity5 to restrict the use of the vehicles in the field			1
maj. gen. @entity12 , commander of @entity13 - 101 , ordered this week that the use of @entity2 vehicles outside a military base would have to specifically be approved by a colonel -- one of the most senior field grade positions in the military			1
prior to this , the use of @entity2 ( hmmwv , or @entity2 ) had to be approved by a lower - ranking officer , according to @entity13 spokesman maj. @entity24			0
@entity24 said the decision was not specifically in reaction to a number of deadly @entity29 attacks on troops in recent weeks , but is part of trying to improve protection for the force			1
the @entity2 is heavily armored , but its flat bottom and low - to - the - ground profile has made it particularly vulnerable to attacks using improvised explosive devices , or ieds			1
in recent years , the military has fielded a new series of armored vehicles with v - shaped hulls to deflect the blast of roadside bombs , but even some of those have been destroyed in large - scale attacks			0
@entity12 's decision comes amid the release of figures showing that june has been the deadliest month of the war for the coalition across @entity5 , with 101 coalition troops killed and about 400 @entity8 troops wounded			2
casualties due to ied attacks continue to skyrocket			0
the @entity58 reports that in may 2010 , the latest data available , the number of coalition forces -- including @entity5 -- that were killed or wounded by ied attacks was 284 , more than double the 104 killed or wounded in the same month last year			0
the number of overall @entity29 attacks reached 1,128 , compared to 513 in may 2009			2
the @entity58 statistics on ieds include @entity5 troop casualties because those units are suffering very high attacks rates , according to the @entity58 .			0
