-- @entity1 first won on the @entity2 until he was 20 , and world no. 1 @entity3 was 19 when he managed a @entity6 success			0
neither can rival the prodigious @entity8 , a @entity9 golfer on a record - breaking rise			1
@entity12 's three - shot victory at the @entity13 , four months and two days after her 15th birthday , made her the youngest winner in @entity18 history , and the first amateur to win on the @entity21 circuit since @entity22 in 1969			1
it has been a stellar year for the @entity25 - born teen , with her record - breaking success coming two weeks after her triumph at the @entity21 @entity28 and seven months after she became the youngest woman to win a pro tournament at the @entity31			1
" it feels amazing , " she told @entity33 's official website after sunday 's landmark win , capped off with a final five - under - par round of 67			1
" i broke the youngest record in january for the @entity31 and to break another record or being in the history books , it 's amazing , and it 's always awesome to be able to play with the pros			2
" so i never knew i had it coming , and i was so happy to win the @entity43 , to win this			2
i never think about it , i just wanted to make the cut			0
" and when i saw that i was tied first after the second day , i was like , wow			0
i 'm feeling really good			0
and yeah , kind of surprised to have two wins in such a short time			0
" the tournament at the @entity49 came with a $ 300,000 check for the winner , but @entity12 will not see a cent of it			1
while her amateur status may be detrimental to her bank balance , some seasoned observers are advising she stays among the amateur ranks for a little longer yet			2
" in the end it was a pretty comfortable win for a player who is new to this level and competing with the top 48 out of 50 money winners on the @entity18 , " said @entity9 golfing legend @entity59 , who won the 1963 @entity60			1
" i understand that she has expressed interest in going to college here in the @entity70 at @entity71			0
she has obviously shown that she is good enough but i think she would benefit from a few more years as an amateur			0
i am pleased to hear that she wants to stay amateur for a few more years and that she intends to get an education behind her			0
" while she has endless possibilities with her golf game , you never know what is going to happen and i encourage any young player to keep up the study while they are playing golf to help with other options later in life			0
" @entity12 echoed the views of @entity59 , while stressing she was keen to not forget the amateur scene which has helped her become one of the world 's most exciting young golfers			1
the teenager is also helped by a wealthy benefactor			0
@entity95 @entity94 donated some of his $ 220 million fortune to @entity12 earlier this year , which meant she could retain her amateur status and continue with her education			1
" i 'll still remain an amateur and then finish high school and then go to college in the @entity70 , " @entity12 said on the @entity102 's official website			1
" i mean this is a great win , but i do n't think this will affect me changing my roots to my career			0
" @entity9 golf chief executive @entity110 hailed @entity12 's triumph as a landmark day in the history of the sport in the country			1
" she has delivered one of the great days in @entity9 golf history , " said @entity110			0
" @entity8 has beaten a field of world - class professionals at the age of 15			1
" it is not only a standout achievement in the history of @entity9 golf but also in the annals of @entity9 sport			0
perhaps the most exciting thing with @entity8 is , the best is yet to come			2
" the @entity127 - based @entity12 , who has rocketed 140 places up the world rankings to 45th , will now turn her attention to the @entity60 -- which begins on september 13			2
after finishing tied for 39th at july 's @entity131 , her first major , many will be expecting @entity12 to carry her current form into one of the sport 's four marquee events			2
@entity12 is being backed to succeed by one of her @entity139 forerunners , @entity141 , who managed three third - place finishes -- one outright and two tied -- during her @entity18 career			1
" she will have more opportunities and obligations than she can possibly fulfill , " said the 43 - year - old , who turned pro in 1992 after graduating from @entity147 and established herself in @entity148 before returning to the @entity21 " she needs to make sure she keeps the enjoyment in her game because that is one of the things that has made her successful			1
" yes she has missed out on the $ 300,000 but it is never about the money			1
she will be well supported for the rest of her life			0
it is never about the money though			0
it is about the achievement of winning and in @entity8 's case creating history			2

@entity8 became the youngest ever @entity18 winner on sunday
the 15 - year - old is the first amateur to win on the tour since @entity22 in 1969
@entity173 's *non-professional* status means she missed out on $ 300,000 prize money
@entity25 - born @entity12 plans to remain amateur and attend college in the @entity21
