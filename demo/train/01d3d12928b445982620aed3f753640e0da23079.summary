-- defending champion @entity1 expressed sadness after illness forced her withdrawal from this year 's @entity5 in the @entity7 city @entity8 on wednesday , while @entity9 and @entity10 reached the semifinals of the season - ending event			1
@entity1 , who lost in straight sets to @entity14 of @entity15 in her opening round - robin match on tuesday , is suffering from a viral illness			1
" i 'm really sad to withdraw from the tournament			0
it 's a great tournament and it was an honor to be here , " the 22 - year - old @entity19 told the @entity5 's official website			1
" i hope i can come back next year			0
i 've never withdrawn from a tournament , this is the first time for me			0
i do n't like to give up , so i 'm really disappointed			0
" when i played i thought i was nervous , but normally nerves are gone after the first set , and it was actually happening during all the match			2
i was shaking all match and was n't feeling very well			2
after one rally with @entity14 i could n't breathe			0
" @entity1 will be replaced by world no. 9 @entity31 in the elite eight - woman lineup			1
the @entity34 can still reach the semifinals if she beats second seed @entity10 and @entity37 's @entity36 , the @entity39 runner - up , in her remaining matches in the @entity41			1
second - ranked @entity10 went through to the last four after coming from behind to overcome @entity14 5 - 7 7 - 5 7 - 5 in a match lasting three hours and 12 minutes that finally finished after 2 a.m. local time			1
the @entity44 , who won the tournament as a 17 - year - old in 2004 , faced defeat at 4 - 2 down in the second set to follow up her opening win over @entity36			0
" i was a little bit frustrated early on			0
i was n't doing the right things and she was doing all the right things , and making me make mistakes , " said @entity10 , who hit 66 winners to @entity14 's 18 but also led in unforced errors 64 to 19			1
" i was injured last year and did n't play very well , so to be in the semifinals this year makes me very proud , and especially given the way i fought tonight			2
" in the @entity61 , world no. 1 @entity60 stayed on course to finish the year as the top - ranked player -- but only just as she took over three hours to see off the challenge of @entity65			1
the @entity66 saved two match points against the @entity68 to win 6 - 7 7 - 6 ( 13 - 11 ) 6 - 4 and now needs just one more win to finish on top , and so deny @entity10 the chance to end the year as no. 1			1
" on the match points i just thought i had to go for it -- she was n't going to miss , and i did n't want to wait for her to make a mistake , " @entity60 said			0
" i was so determined to make it happen			0
i wanted to take destiny into my hands -- if i missed those shots , it was going to be up to me , not up to my opponent			0
" in the earlier @entity61 match on wednesday , @entity9 earned her second straight - sets victory in as many days with a 7 - 6 6 - 3 win over @entity88 's @entity87 in a match that lasted one hour and 50 minutes			1
the @entity91 's hard - fought victory was not without incident as the winner of @entity94 , the @entity95 and the @entity96 smashed her racket , and so earned a code violation , after serving two successive double faults to lose a service game			2
" i started out really strong in the first game but then started making errors , and @entity87 started playing her game and playing it well - that 's all , " @entity9 said			1
" i was a little tight and my serve was n't working at all , maybe towards the end - but that 's not how i usually play			0
the good thing is i can only play better			0
" the 31 - year - old , playing her first tournament since winning the @entity95 , will become the event 's oldest champion should she win her third title , with previous successes coming in 2001 and 2009 .			2
