-- @entity2 boxing legend @entity1 has dropped a shock hint that he might quit the ring -- because his mother does not want him to fight anymore			1
@entity1 is widely expected to fight @entity6 in a much - hyped showdown later this year , but the 31 - year - old claims his place in boxing history is already assured following the successful defense of his @entity13 welterweight crown against @entity14 last week			1
" i reached my dream as a boxer without @entity6 in my career			2
i do not need him , they are the ones who need me , " he told reporters as he returned home to his customary hero 's welcome in the @entity2 on monday			2
the fighter , known as " @entity1 " by his fans , is now concentrating on his political career			2
he is standing for election in the @entity29 province on may 10 , on the platform of opposition senator @entity32 's @entity31			2
@entity1 's personal web site has carried media reports detailing how his mother @entity35 has implored him not to fight anymore , prompted by the ear injury he picked up in his battle against @entity38 last year			1
" she kneels down and cries every time [ she asks me to quit ]			0
that 's a heavy burden when it 's my mother doing that , " he told reporters after meeting @entity2 president @entity41 in @entity42 on monday morning			1
" i have been boxing since i was 12 years old			0
now i 'm 31 , so i 'm seriously thinking about it			0
i will discuss it with my family			0
" i have been in boxing for a long time and i have given so many honors to my country			0
even without the elections and the politics , my retirement will largely depend on my family 's decision			0
" @entity59 , a millionaire property developer , met @entity1 at the airport and the boxer was quick to sing his praises			0
" what we need now is a man who rose from poverty , who understands the call of the poor like myself , " @entity1 said			0
@entity1 has now won 12 straight fights and titles at seven different weights to establish himself , according to the rankings by respected boxing magazine ring , as the best pound - for - pound boxer in the world			1
a money - spinning fight against the undefeated @entity6 fell through earlier this year when the @entity77 insisted on @entity79 - style drug testing , leading to a war of words and a stalemate in negotiations			1
@entity1 opted to fight @entity84 's @entity14 , whom he beat in 12 rounds , while @entity6 will take on fellow @entity77 @entity86 on may 1			1
any likely meeting between the two would probably be the richest in box office history and be staged at the @entity90 in @entity91 , although @entity1 filled the home stadium of the @entity95 @entity94 team -- where the @entity6 fight was initially scheduled to be held -- for his bout with @entity14 .			1
