@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration released two documents on friday describing the scope of @entity7 data collection programs , a bid to quiet criticism they violate privacy rights			1
an @entity7 memorandum describes the beginnings of the agency 's collection of so - called telephone metadata of nearly every @entity17 under a provision of the @entity19 , and the agency 's monitoring of foreign internet traffic			1
the agency says in the memo that its systems monitor 1.6 % of the world 's internet traffic , and its analysts review .00004 % of global traffic			0
published accounts drawn from leaked documents provided by admitted @entity7 leaker @entity32 have portrayed a much broader eavesdropping system under section 702 of the @entity19			1
another document from the @entity36 describes the legal basis for collecting the telephone metadata , such as the numbers dialed , the length and time of the calls			0
the government says the @entity7 phone data collection operated under court supervision , and that the database is only accessed for specific searches in counterterrorism investigations			1
the document also explains why government lawyers say the program carried out under section 215 of the @entity19 respects constitutional @entity52 and @entity53 freedoms , which protect free speech rights and prohibit the government from unreasonable search and seizure			2
the release of the documents came as president @entity3 held a news conference where he addressed the @entity32 leaks , and promised greater transparency about the government 's surveillance programs			1
see @entity7 document ( @entity66 ) he defended the @entity7 programs which he said have been incorrectly portrayed as an invasion of privacy and said they were key to protecting national security			1
still , the president promised to consider changes to help reassure the public that the @entity19 was n't leading to abuses			0
the @entity7 memo describes how the agency was monitoring conversations between one of the hijackers that carried out the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks and people in an @entity86 safe house in @entity87			2
the agency says it did n't have the ability to find out that the hijacker was already in the @entity17 living in @entity91 , and therefore could n't tell the @entity92			0
according to the memo , the data collection programs were begun to address those shortcomings			1
the @entity7 memo also for the first time explains some of the confusion over various agency codenames for its collection programs			1
according to the @entity7 , the agency uses different code names for data collected from each communications company			1
" some that have been revealed in the press recently include @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , and @entity111			0
while some have tried to characterize the involvement of such providers as separate programs , that is not accurate , " the memo says			2
the justice white paper released friday argues that " the vast majority of the telephony metadata is never seen by any person because it is not responsive to the limited queries that are authorized			0
but the information that is generated in response to these limited queries could be especially significant in helping the government identify and disrupt terrorist plots			0
" the document also says that the phone data does n't " involve tracking locations from which telephone calls are made			2
" the government 's three branches , including the @entity135 and @entity136 , help oversee the programs , the @entity132 memo argues			0
critics have argued that the data collection violates privacy rights , and that the government should require warrants to collect such information			1
the @entity144 last year restricted the government 's use of @entity147 on cars of suspects under investigation , making it necessary to seek warrants			0
the @entity36 says the phone metadata is different and that " @entity144 precedent makes clear that participants in telephone calls lack a reasonable expectation of privacy for purposes of the @entity53 in the telephone numbers used to make and receive their calls			0
" in any case , the @entity132 memo says " any arguable privacy intrusion arising from the collection of telephony metadata would be outweighed by the public interest in identifying suspected terrorist operatives and thwarting terrorist plots			2
" the justice memo also argues that the government 's rules " expressly prohibits the collection of records for an investigation that is being conducted solely on the basis of protected @entity175 activity , if the investigation is of a @entity17 person			0
