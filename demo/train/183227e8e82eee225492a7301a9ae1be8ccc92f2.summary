if you were disturbed yesterday by the video we released of @entity3 being force - fed like a @entity5 prisoner , please consider : right now this is happening 90 times a day at @entity5			1
( if you have n't seen it yet , the video is here			2
you may find the images distressing			0
) in fact , what you saw slightly understates what @entity13 's clients and many others go through twice daily			0
after all , @entity3 volunteered for the procedure and could stop it anytime			1
yet still it hurt him			0
the reason for this is that when you are nervous , as he naturally was , your throat tends to tense and catches the tube			0
our doctors tried to intubate him twice but just could n't get the tube through			0
and you see for yourself how violated he felt by the end			0
this is the process @entity5 's pr staff try to whitewash with the bland term " enteral feeding			1
" in the real thing , a team of soldiers in riot gear come for my hunger - striking clients , like @entity41 or @entity42			2
after weeks of starvation the men are shrivelled , weak , and 10 times as afraid as @entity3 was			2
when the military straps them into the chair , not a word they can say will stop the procedure			0
and if they feel ill and throw up , as force - fed prisoners sometimes do , the military will just repeat the grim business all over again			1
the overwhelming reaction from @entity54 and the web yesterday was disgust that this could happen in @entity57			0
yet it is , and the most worrying part is : it does n't need to			0
president @entity60 could end the strike tomorrow with one decisive step -- he could start to transfer cleared prisoners			1
eighty - six of the men ( a majority of those left ) have been cleared by the @entity57 government , and it has the power to issue waivers so that these men can be transferred			2
my clients have consistently stated they will consider eating again when they see a cleared man go home			2
this is much more achievable than the @entity60 administration would have us believe			0
this week , @entity80 press secretary @entity79 pointed to a @entity82 moratorium on detainee transfers to @entity84 , and said @entity60 " calls on @entity82 to work with him to ensure we can lift the ban			1
" however , @entity79 -- and @entity60 -- conveniently ignore those cases for which there is no obstruction to release beyond the @entity80 's lack of political will			2
this is especially true where cleared men are slated to go to close @entity57 allies			0
one of my clients , @entity97 , a cleared hunger - striker , could be on a plane to @entity99 within a week -- the @entity101 prime minister @entity100 has asked for him back			1
another cleared client , @entity41 , has family in @entity104 waiting to welcome him			0
and there are more like him			0
the best way for @entity60 to stop the strike is to show that he 's serious about closing @entity5 -- and the best way to do that is to release one of these men , a move for which he does not need @entity82 approval			1
this week , a federal judge had to give the president an elementary lesson on @entity118 of the @entity119 to remind @entity60 that , yes , he is commander - in - chief and therefore , yes , he has the power to deal with the ongoing crisis at @entity5			1
judge @entity122 was responding to attempts by @entity13 and our co-counsel @entity124 to stop force - feeding for four of our clients , especially during the daytime in @entity129			1
muslims traditionally fast during those hours , and we told the court force - feeding during the holy month would be a further slap in the face			1
although judge @entity122 denied our motion , her opinion also issued a stinging rebuke to the @entity60 administration , finding that despite @entity144 protestations to the contrary , " it is perfectly clear ... that force - feeding is a painful , humiliating , and degrading process			1
" while judge @entity122 felt she had no power to halt the feeding , she said she knew of one person who could : even though this court ... lacks any authority to rule on @entity153 's request , there is an individual who does have the authority to address the issue			0
in a speech on may 23 , 013 , president @entity60 stated " look at the current situation , where we are force - feeding detainees who are holding a hunger strike			1
is that who we are ? is that something that our founders foresaw ? is that the @entity57 we want to leave to our children ? our sense of justice is stronger than that			0
" the @entity172 , as commander - in - chief , has the authority — and power — to directly address the issue of force - feeding of the detainees at @entity179			1
the @entity80 has been silent since @entity60 's speech at the @entity181			2
it has been over six weeks since the president asked the @entity57 people whether force - feeding was " who we are			1
" yet his military continues to do it			0
and there is no sign of any of the cleared 86 men being sent home			0
there is now an overwhelming consensus that the current state of affairs in @entity5 -- a situation for which @entity60 is directly responsible -- is unacceptable			2
what will it take to get the @entity80 to wake up , treat this like the crisis that it is , and do the right thing to stop the strike : send the cleared prisoners home ?			1
