@entity0 , @entity1 the mortar was dropped into the launch tube , but nothing happened			1
a prod , a kick and a shake failed to stir it			0
eventually one of the @entity12 fighters at this position near @entity0 unceremoniously tipped the tube upside down , picked up the offending shell and lobbed it over the sandbags , where mercifully it failed to explode			1
about 100 @entity19 fighters were at this frontline position in @entity0 late last week , perhaps the most contested piece of real estate in northern @entity1			1
it sits at a junction that leads from @entity0 to @entity25 and beyond to the @entity27 border -- a critical supply line for the @entity29 in @entity1 and @entity27 ( @entity30 )			1
supported by coalition air strikes , the @entity12 swept down to seize the area late last month			1
now they are engaged in daily battles with @entity30 fighters , many of whom are local , according to @entity12 commanders who listen in on @entity30 radio communications			1
between the sandbags and through the haze , a white building 800 yards away protected an @entity30 position			1
after one mortar was ( this time successfully ) fired at the building , a sniper 's bullet shot over the @entity12 ' position with a faint hiss -- as if to say " you missed			1
" the @entity19 are now well dug in at @entity0 with mortar batteries , at least one @entity51 anti-tank missile and heavy machine guns			1
the @entity51 is especially useful for taking out vehicles rigged up as suicide bombs			0
the wreckage of one sits just 100 yards from the @entity12 ' defensive positions			1
in two days , the @entity19 say , @entity30 sent 20 vehicle bombs up the road , a sign of how badly the terrorists want to retake this position			1
one had 8.5 tons of @entity63 primed to explode , according to @entity12 commanders , but its driver was shot and killed before he could detonate the device			1
the importance of the crossroads was evident from the presence of a small detachment of @entity71 military personnel who covered their faces and quickly drove off at the first sign of a television crew			0
" no photos please , " pleaded their @entity12 minder			1
on the way to @entity0 , the villages around @entity78 show the scars of @entity30 occupation			1
some buildings occupied by the group had been razed by air strikes			1
but many more were blown up by @entity30 fighters as they retreated			2
others were booby - trapped with cleverly - hidden explosive devices to await families coming home			0
one elegant villa on a hill had been reduced to a jagged mix of concrete and steel wire			0
crushed between cement slabs was a flat screen tv ; a staircase lay at a crazy angle			0
the owner -- a @entity12 -- stood outside , curling amber beads between his fingers			2
his nephew had come to the house with three others , he said			0
they opened the front door and there was a massive explosion			0
the commander of this area and head of the @entity1 @entity112 is @entity113 , one of @entity12 president @entity115 's sons			1
at his well - guarded hilltop base , he waved his hand across a map of the region			0
the @entity19 have retaken some 5,000 square miles of territory since the high - water mark of @entity30 ' expansion in this region , and now guard a front of some 700 miles -- an area stretching from @entity126 in the north to @entity128 in the center of @entity1			1
" the myth of @entity30 being undefeated has been broken , " @entity115 said			2
but he also described @entity30 as " pretty much intact " as a fighting force			2
he estimated it has some 40,000 members in @entity27 and @entity1 , aided by many more collaborators and sympathizers among @entity137 @entity136 tribes alienated by @entity1 's previous government			2
but now the @entity140 army had to step up , he said			0
the @entity12 could not -- and should not -- take mainly @entity136 towns like @entity25 , which @entity30 has held since june			1
" we do n't want to create any political sensitivities with the @entity136 , " said @entity115			0
@entity115 -- like many in the region and beyond -- is trying to work out @entity30 ' strategy in @entity1			1
its center of gravity appears to be shifting south and west , with most offensive operations taking place in @entity149 and @entity153 ad @entity151 provinces			0
its raid on the town of @entity156 in @entity149 , using sleeper cells within and coordinated attacks from outside , shows that @entity30 is still capable of complex operations , even after months of airstrikes			2
some of these territorial gains are fleeting and tactical and may be intended to pull @entity140 forces in different directions			0
for example , @entity30 last week launched an attack on villages south of the city of @entity168 , which it still holds , drawing in a mixture of @entity140 military , police and @entity174 militia units			2
at the same time , @entity30 is making a major effort to resupply and reinforce its presence in @entity0			1
from a ridge overlooking the town of @entity126 , we witnessed a constant stream of trucks and tankers traveling between the @entity27 border and the @entity0 area at high speed , as coalition drones and f - 16s flew overhead			1
@entity115 believes @entity30 is redeploying fighters from @entity27 to this part of @entity1			1
the @entity12 ' progress means militants have had to take a circuitous route , but there is no sign that @entity30 is ready to abandon @entity0 -- a symbolic and strategic prize			1
@entity30 draws on the victories of @entity197 against the @entity198 900 years ago and his slaughter of @entity200 throughout what is now @entity27			2
@entity202 united @entity203 and @entity0 under his rule , and built a mosque in his name in @entity0			2
it was at that same mosque , on the first friday of @entity208 last year , when @entity209 took to the pulpit to declare his caliphate			0
inside the city , however , the situation is dire , according to accounts of the few residents who have been able to leave , messages from inside the city , and @entity12 officials			2
water and electricity are in short supply , the price of basics has rocketed , and @entity30 ' rule has become more draconian			2
suspected " collaborators " are being summarily executed , among them former police and military officers			0
@entity30 has been building up its defenses around the city with trenches and berms , and has destroyed at least one main bridge			2
@entity115 told @entity2 that in areas the @entity12 had taken , people were " literally starving ... in extremely bad condition			0
" " people are afraid to send their girls out because they are afraid they might be taken as concubines for the emirs or fighters ; they are afraid to send young boys out to run errands because they 're afraid they might be taken as fighters for @entity30 , " he said			0
but across @entity1 , @entity30 continues to benefit both from @entity246 's weakness and sectarian tensions			1
@entity140 security forces are being retrained and reorganized with @entity250 help , but they 're not yet fit for purpose and still reliant on @entity174 militias , known as @entity253 , in some areas			0
nor are they familiar with the close urban combat that will be required to retake a city like @entity0			0
the murder in the capital of a prominent @entity137 tribal leader , @entity260 , on friday has again inflamed sectarian tensions , with @entity137 blocs suspending their participation in the parliament and government			0
@entity266 had campaigned for investigations into the disappearance of @entity137			0
a leading @entity137 figure in the government , deputy prime minister @entity271 , said after the attack : " we must get rid of militias and weapons must be put in the hands of the state			0
" prime minister @entity278 has promised to do just that , but must also be aware of the need for effective fighting forces against @entity30			0
the result , says @entity282 of @entity283 , is that " @entity140 civilians are being hammered by @entity30 and then by pro-government militias in areas they seize from @entity30			1
" @entity283 is investigating the deaths of more than 70 people after a @entity174 militia captured a @entity137 village in @entity292 last month			0
" with the government responding to those they deem terrorists with arbitrary arrests and executions , residents have nowhere to turn for protection , " @entity282 said			0
and that 's just what @entity30 wants .			0

the frontline position in @entity0 is perhaps the most contested piece of real estate in northern @entity1
supported by coalition air strikes , the @entity12 swept down to seize the area late last month
in two days , the @entity19 say , @entity30 sent 20 vehicle bombs up the road
