@entity0 -- dr. @entity3 's defense team challenged the motives and methods of the prosecution 's anesthesiology expert friday , while the judge threatened to hold the defense propofol expert in contempt for comments he made about the prosecution			1
dr. @entity14 , the last prosecution witness , will still be on the witness stand when the trial resumes monday			1
@entity14 testified thursday that the " only scenario " to explain @entity22 's death was that he overdosed on propofol infused through an iv drip set up by dr. @entity3			1
prosecutors argue that @entity3 's reckless use of the surgical anesthetic propofol to help @entity22 sleep led to his death , while the defense contends @entity22 self - administered the fatal dose , along with sedatives , without @entity3 knowing			1
@entity14 , in his testimony thursday , said the level of propofol in @entity22 's blood taken during his autopsy could not have been from either @entity3 or @entity22 injecting the drug , but only from an iv system that was still flowing when his heart stopped			1
prosecutors , however , opened the door for one scenario in which @entity22 , not @entity3 , could have triggered the overdose			2
" can you rule out the possibility that @entity22 manipulated something to cause it to flow ? " deputy district attorney @entity46 asked friday			0
" that 's a possibility , " @entity14 said			2
but that is assuming @entity3 set up the drip and left @entity22 's side , he said			2
would @entity14 's opinion that @entity3 was responsible for @entity22 's death change if he knew @entity22 turned the drip on ? " no , if @entity22 had reached up , seen the roller clamp and opened it himself , this is a foreseeable consequence of setting up an essentially dangerous way of giving drugs , " @entity14 said			1
" it does n't change things at all			0
it would still be considered abandonment			0
" lead defense lawyer @entity62 decided to conduct @entity14 's cross-examination instead of leaving it to @entity66 , the defense team 's most knowledgeable lawyer about propofol			2
toxicology studies of drugs in @entity22 's blood and computer models @entity14 used to analyze how he died were overshadowed friday when @entity73 focused on the personal and professional rivalry between @entity14 and dr. @entity75 , the defense expert			1
the experts first met in 1978 when @entity75 was an assistant professor at @entity77 and @entity14 was a medical student			0
they became friends and co-authored research papers , but this trial appears to have changed their friendship			0
@entity73 accused @entity14 of wanting to " shove it down his ( @entity75 's ) professional throat " in a question stricken from the record by @entity88 judge @entity87			0
@entity75 was lectured by judge pastor about comments about @entity14 attributed to him in an online blog			0
@entity75 admitted friday that he told a reporter that he had changed his opinion of @entity14 after hearing his testimony thursday			0
" i was his teacher when he was a medical student , " @entity95 @entity96 quoted @entity75 as saying			0
" the truth will come out			0
" @entity75 denied calling @entity14 " a scumbag , " as the website quoted him as saying			0
pastor , who imposed a gag order on all parties in the trial , set a contempt of court hearing for @entity75 next month			1
" you are not in any way shape or form , to comment on your views regarding the state of the evidence , witnesses or your views as to any counsel in this case , " pastor said			0
@entity73 cross-examined @entity14 about the assumptions he used to reconstruct an iv drip system he believed @entity3 set up next to @entity22 's bed			1
@entity14 demonstrated the system in his testimony thursday			0
@entity14 testified that he did not think it was significant that investigators never found a key component of the tubing in the system			0
" it 's so easy to remove , " @entity14 said			0
@entity3 appeared visibly shaken by @entity14 's testimony thursday , especially when he demonstrated his version of the iv drip			2
@entity22 died because @entity3 failed to notice that his patient had stopped breathing while he was hooked up to an iv drip of propofol , @entity14 testified			1
the doctor should have realized @entity22 had stopped breathing about 11:45 a.m. on june 25 , 2009 , he said			0
" when you 're there , you see it , you know it , " @entity14 said			0
phone records and testimony showed that @entity3 was on the phone with one of his clinics , a patient , and then a girlfriend about the time that @entity14 calculated the oxygen in @entity22 's lungs became depleted , causing his heart to stop beating			1
" had @entity3 been with @entity22 during this period of time , he would have seen the slowed breathing and the compromise in the flow of air into @entity22 's lungs , and he could have easily turned off the propofol infusion , " @entity14 said @entity3 , accused of involuntary manslaughter , could have then easily cleared @entity22 's airways and restored his breathing by lifting his chin , he said			1
earlier testimony from paramedics and emergency room doctors said @entity22 was clinically dead by the time an ambulance arrived at the pop icon 's @entity0 home nearly a half - hour after @entity3 realized there was a problem			2
the last three prosecution experts , all medical experts , focused the @entity3 trial on the science surrounding @entity22 's death , a contrast to earlier testimony from @entity3 's girlfriends and @entity22 employees			1
@entity14 demonstrated how he believed @entity3 set up the propofol infusion by hanging a 100 - milliliter vial from a stand with tubing attached that would have led to a catheter port in @entity22 's left leg			1
" this is the only scenario that i could generate " that would produce the high level of propofol found in @entity22 's blood during his autopsy , @entity14 said			1
" this fits all of the data in this case , and i am not aware of any data that is inconsistent with this explanation , " he said			0
the @entity200 coroner ruled that @entity22 's death was caused by a combination of sedatives with the propofol , which @entity3 admitted in a police interview that he used to help @entity22 sleep			1
the defense contends that @entity22 swallowed eight lorazepam tablets , a claim based on testing of lorazepam levels in @entity22 's stomach contents			2
@entity14 discredited the defense lab tests , saying a new test showed the equivalent of only " 1/43rd of a tablet " of the sedative in the stomach			0
the level of lorazepam in @entity22 's blood was far higher than what would be expected based on the dosages dr. @entity3 told detectives he gave @entity22 in the hours before his death , @entity14 said			1
@entity3 said he gave @entity22 a total of 4 milligrams of lorazepam in two separate doses starting 10 hours before his death			2
toxicology results indicated that @entity22 was given 40 milligrams -- not four -- in a series of 10 doses , he said			0
@entity14 testified wednesday that @entity22 would be alive now but for 17 " egregious deviations " by @entity3 from the standard of care required of physicians			1
@entity3 's use of propofol almost every night for two months to help @entity22 sleep was so unusual , there is no documentation on the dangers , @entity14 said			1
" we are in pharmacological never - neverland here , " @entity14 said , " something that 's only been done to @entity22			2
" the trial is expected to conclude with the start of jury deliberations possible as soon as the end of next week .			2

new : defense anesthesiology expert faces a contempt of court hearing
