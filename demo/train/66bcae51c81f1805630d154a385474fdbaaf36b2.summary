-- @entity2 's 1992 debut is a grenade that keeps exploding			1
among ' 90s albums , only " nevermind " and " @entity8 " rival it for cultural impact			1
rage made hip - hop - tinged funk metal the new rebel music , taking over the alienation beat from grunge slackers and making @entity15 sloganeering seem badass			2
like any good revolutionary sect , the band members were n't without their contradictions and tensions			2
@entity21 's blocky , academically aspirational rhymes preached leftist revolution , and guitarist and sonic architect @entity23 practiced an almost authoritarian control and extreme technical precision as he mimicked sampling , sent down thunderous power chords and , occasionally , indulged in almost @entity30 - y solos			0
( see the liquid note - bending on " @entity32			0
" ) @entity0 : @entity2 box set marks 20th anniversary of first lp remastered to museum - clean standards , the reissued album comes with dvds of live shows and music videos , plus demos that prove just how down and detailed the group had every song ( even if @entity23 still could n't resist changing solos )			1
the rap appropriation has lost the force of novelty , of course , but blaming @entity2 for @entity50 is like blaming @entity51 for @entity52			1
@entity0 : 500 greatest albums of all time @entity56 's throat - scraping eruptions about suicide ( the fate of an outcast in " @entity60 " ) and bullets in the head feel as primal as any lefty rock -- and maybe more so , heard from inside @entity23 's palace of sound			0
rage was machine - like , yes , but built to change worlds			0
