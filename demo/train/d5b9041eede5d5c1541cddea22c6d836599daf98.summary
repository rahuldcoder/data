on their own , they 're simple household items			2
but combine them with explosives , and you can get the kind of bombs that investigators now suspect were used to turn the finish line of the @entity12 into a bloody nightmare			1
scraps of them found at the scene of the twin bombings are being sent to the @entity21 's national laboratory , where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices , the federal agent leading the investigation said tuesday			1
meanwhile , investigators combed through a digital mountain of photos and video clips and asked the public for help finding who planted them at two points on @entity31			2
" someone knows who did this , " said @entity32 , the special agent in charge of the @entity21 's @entity35 office			1
" cooperation from the community will play a crucial role in this investigation			2
" @entity43 asked people to report anyone who talked about targeting monday 's race or showed interest in explosives			2
he urged anyone who might have heard the sounds of explosions in remote areas -- possibly by someone testing a bomb -- or saw someone carrying " an unusually heavy , dark - colored bag " around monday to come forward			2
' @entity35 will overcome , ' mayor vows there has been no claim of responsibility , @entity32 said			1
" the range of suspects and motives remains wide open , " he said			1
the @entity65 government has warned federal agencies in the past that pressure cookers -- airtight pots used to quickly cook or preserve foods -- have been packed with explosives and shrapnel and detonated with blasting camps			1
a law enforcement official said monday 's bombs were likely detonated by timers			1
photos obtained by @entity78 showed the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene , along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings			1
a federal law enforcement source told @entity78 the photos were included in a bulletin sent to federal law enforcement agencies			2
the pieces recovered so far suggest the devices , which were identical , could carry 6 liters ( 1.5 gallons ) of liquid apiece , a @entity35 law enforcement source said			1
the parts found include a partial circuit board , which would be used to detonate a device			1
' very effective ' bombs pressure cooker bombs can be " very effective , " terrorism expert @entity98 told @entity78			1
@entity101 and @entity102 militants " use them to make their ieds , " he said			2
" that does n't mean it was the @entity101 -- other people can read about this , " said @entity98 , who served in the @entity21 , @entity106 and the military 's @entity107			1
but so far , investigators have found no foreign or @entity102 connection to the bombings , a @entity65 official told @entity78			1
and sen. @entity118 , the ranking @entity119 on the @entity120 , told reporters in @entity122 that some of the facts suggest the carnage had its roots in @entity65 soil			2
" there are a lot of things that are surrounding this that would give an indication that it may have been a domestic terrorist , but that just ca n't be assumed , " @entity118 said			2
we 've been hit before on home soil homeland security secretary @entity136 said the bombings do n't appear to be harbingers of " a broader plot			2
" but she urged @entity65 " to remain vigilant and immediately report any signs of suspicious activity to local law enforcement officials			2
" and members of @entity144 who were briefed by @entity146 administration officials on told reporters that the field of possible suspects remains wide open			1
" we really do n't know if it 's a foreign or domestic threat , " said rep. @entity150 , @entity151 , chairman of the @entity152			0
" we do n't know whether this was a homegrown terrorist or part of a wider conspiracy			0
" director of national intelligence @entity158 held closed - door talks with the @entity120 on tuesday			0
@entity118 , @entity161 , told reporters afterward that " there 's not a whole lot of update to give			0
" what we know about the bombings so far " this is a very fluid investigation			0
the @entity21 's in the lead , and i personally know the special agent in charge			1
he 's one of the best , " @entity118 said			0
late monday , authorities searched the apartment of a young @entity178 man who was among the wounded at the race			0

" he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time , " the @entity65 official said			1
a @entity178 woman , a medical student who was also injured in the blast , has also been interviewed by investigators , according to a law enforcement source			0
@entity35 's ' most complex crime scene ' ever investigators are combing what @entity35 police commissioner @entity191 called " the most complex crime scene that we 've dealt with in the history of our department			1
" the cordoned off area has been reduced from 15 blocks to 12 and will be reduced further in coming days , he said			0
even the smallest bits of debris could help indicate the bombs ' " signature , " said a federal law enforcement official who works in the intelligence community			1
the explosives themselves were small , and initial tests showed no @entity207 or other high - grade explosive material -- suggesting the packages used in the attack were crude devices			0
how you can help based on the bombs ' effects , the devices could have been small enough to be concealed in small bags or boxes , a law enforcement official said			1
the smoke was consistent with a " low - velocity improvised explosive mixture , perhaps flash powder or sugar chlorate mixture , " the official said			1
two photos obtained by @entity78 affiliate @entity226 might raise more questions			0
the first shows a light - colored bag sitting on the ground next to a mailbox			0
the second -- of the same spot -- shows a blast seemingly where that bag sat , with the mailbox still upright			0
investigators have not commented on these photos , which @entity226 reports it has shared with authorities			0
when the pieces that have been recovered are sent to the @entity21 laboratory in @entity242 , @entity243 , investigators will try to better understand how they worked and look for clues like fingerprints , dna or serial numbers to help track who planted them , the @entity35 law enforcement source said			1
authorities have n't given any timetable as to when they expect significantly new details			0
but @entity43 vowed tuesday that the more than 1,000 law enforcement officers from more than 30 agencies will get results , even if they have to go " to the @entity257 " to get them			0
" our mission is clear : to bring to justice those responsible , " he said			0
" the @entity65 public wants answers			0
the citizens of the city of @entity35 and the @entity266 want and deserve answers			1
" @entity35 heroes : running to help authorities have begun to search through huge amounts of video and images from surveillance cameras in the area near the attack			1
so far , no footage has been spotted showing someone placing the bombs , a law enforcement source said			1
authorities have asked anyone with images from any part of the marathon to share them with police			0
" people do n't know that they were witnesses -- that they might actually have evidence in their phones or in their cameras , " @entity287 , president @entity146 's former assistant secretary for homeland security , said on @entity78 's " @entity289			0
" @entity191 vowed authorities will sift " through every frame of every video			0
" the @entity21 is likely issuing subpoenas for records from cell towers in the area to isolate and trace calls from around @entity302 at the time of the blasts , according to a federal law enforcement official			1
doctors believe bombs contained sharp objects two doctors overseeing treatment of the injured believe the explosive devices contained nails or similar objects			1
many patients have severe wounds " related to the blast effect of the bomb as well as small metallic fragments that entered their body , " including " pellets " and " nail - like objects , " said dr. @entity316 , head of trauma care at @entity318			0
a variety of sharp objects were found inside the patients ' bodies , he said , adding that the bombs probably contained multiple metallic fragments			1
asked whether what was found in the patients ' bodies could have come from nearby objects that exploded in the blast , @entity316 said he believes the materials were likely part of the explosive devices			1

" but three were injured by " perfectly round objects " that were " very uniform , consistent , metallic , " he said			0
and another patient had more than 12 carpenter - type nails			0
" there is no question some of these objects were implanted in the device for the purpose of being exploded forward , " @entity348 said			0
no unexploded bombs suspicious packages that were detonated out of precaution after the bombings turned out not to be explosive devices after all			2
after the blasts monday , some officials reported that explosive devices that failed to go off were found			2
but investigators said tuesday the only bombs were the two that exploded at the marathon			2
