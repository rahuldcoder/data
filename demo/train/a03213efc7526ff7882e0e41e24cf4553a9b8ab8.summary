on christmas day last year , @entity0 was sitting in a brightly lit cafe in southern @entity2 , sharing a laugh with his friends before they set off on their journey			1
@entity0 , a big - hearted taxi driver from @entity6 , northern @entity7 , was part of a team of volunteers traveling from @entity11 to @entity12 to deliver aid to people in need			1
nicknamed " gadget " by his peers , @entity0 was the only non-muslim in the convoy			2
he sacrificed @entity19 , weekends and family time to do his part for those worst hit by @entity12 's civil war , and was admired by his fellow volunteers			2
this was the father - of - two 's fourth trip to the war - torn country			2
while part of the aid convoy stopped at the @entity2 border , @entity0 was part of a much smaller group that volunteered to press ahead into @entity12 itself			1
in video shot on the day , he explained part of his rationale for answering the call to help			0
" it 's all worthwhile when you see what is needed actually gets where it needs to go , " he said , before hugging a colleague			0
@entity0 was kidnapped by @entity47 a day after the video was made			1
he is now under threat of imminent execution			0
as the clock ticks down , those who made the trip with him are pleading with the leaders of the militant group -- which has declared an independent @entity56 state across parts of @entity12 and @entity58 -- to let @entity0 go			1
" @entity0 was moved by the suffering of the @entity12 people , in particular the children , " @entity61 said in a @entity63 plea to his colleague 's captors			1
" please do not take his life to pay for the crimes that the international governments have committed			0
" on thursday , more than 100 @entity71 imams and organizations condemned @entity47 ' tactics and joined the call for @entity0 to be released			1
the coalition of @entity71 communities is appealing to @entity47 and the people around them to persuade the militants to change their ways , according to @entity80 , director of faiths forum for @entity82 , one of the signatory organizations to the petition			1
" the un-islamic fanatics are not acting as @entity88 but , as the prime minister has said , they 're acting as monsters , " he told @entity86			0
" they are perpetrating the worst crimes against humanity -- this is not jihad			0
" @entity80 also had a direct message for the black - clad @entity47 executioner known as " @entity97 " -- the man with the @entity82 accent who featured in the group 's gruesome videos of the beheadings of @entity104 hostages @entity105 , @entity106 , and @entity107			1
" @entity97 , we as @entity88 are here to preserve lives , " @entity80 told @entity86			0
" we can not continue this barbaric action			0
come back , face justice , and repent			0
" those who travelled with @entity0 to @entity12 have steered clear of tough talk , adopting a softer tone in addressing the jihadists holding their friend			1
" we beg you to tread the path of justice and show him the compassion in the heart of believers and in your heart , " @entity61 said			0
" we promised @entity0 safety and security as @entity88 and ask you , the leader of @entity130 , to honor our ' amana ' [ bond of trust ]			2
" meanwhile , @entity11 @entity71 community leaders have sought to distance mainstream @entity88 from extremists , launching a social media campaign under the hashtag # notinmyname			1
@entity138 -- director of the anti-extremism charity @entity140 in east @entity82 -- and local youngsters have added their voices to the @entity144 drive			0
" @entity88 are sick and tired of the hate - filled propaganda the terrorists @entity47 and their supporters churn out on social media , " @entity138 said			2
" they are angry that the criminals are using the platforms to radicalise young people and spread their poisonous words of violence in the name of @entity56			0
" regardless of the differences in tone , everyone appealing to @entity47 to free @entity0 agrees on one thing -- the cabbie with the heart of gold can not be left to die			1
