-- the deputy commander of @entity3 forces in @entity4 ordered troops friday to treat the corpses of slain insurgents and civilians with " appropriate dignity and respect			1
" the order follows a video that appears to show four @entity3 @entity13 urinating on bodies , images that sparked swift condemnation from the @entity3 and @entity4 at a particularly crucial period in the @entity3 - led war			1
" we must treat the living and the dead with dignity and respect , " gen. @entity19 said in the directive , which was published friday on the website of the @entity23 - led force in @entity4			1
he said troops must follow the rules of armed conflict and " act honorably at all times			2
" " in order to prevail , for the good of the coalition nations and the @entity4 people , we can do no less			0
" the video surfaced as the @entity3 and the @entity38 have taken tentative steps toward peace negotiations and as the @entity3 and its allies plan to withdraw troops by the end of 2014			1
the general 's directive instructed officers to ensure subordinates know that they are obligated to report any allegations of misconduct involving corpses			2
he promised swift investigations and " appropriate actions " against offenders			0
the directive notes that " defiling , desecrating , mocking , photographing or filming for personal use insurgent dead constitutes a grave breach " of the armed - conflict laws			2
it also violates " basic standards of human decency , and can cause serious damage to relations with the @entity4 government			0
" the directive is dated thursday , one day after a video surfaced online showing four men equipped with what a @entity13 official described as sniper gear urinating on what appeared to be the bodies of three men on the ground			1
one of the men says , " have a great day , buddy			0
" a voice asks , " you got it on the video ? " to which another voice responds , " yeah			2
" another jokes , " @entity81 , like a shower			0
" it was not clear who shot or posted the 39 - second video or where , though a @entity3 official said it was a " reasonable conclusion " it was filmed in @entity4			1
commanders have identified the four @entity13 who appear in the video , but those names have not yet been made public , said spokeswoman @entity92 of the @entity93 ( @entity93 )			1
@entity93 has talked to the @entity13 and all four are currently in the @entity3 , she said			1
investigators are still tracking down information on the person or people who created and posted the video			1
the @entity93 investigation , which was opened wednesday , will report to lt. gen. @entity100 , commander of the @entity101			2
a separate administrative probe also will report to him			0
the investigations are being structured to allow for possible courts martial of the @entity13 involved , as well as a broader administrative probe into issues surrounding the event , according to a @entity13 official			1
those issues include whether commanders of the unit involved were aware of misconduct and whether a breakdown in discipline had occurred , the official said			0
the @entity13 confirmed @entity100 's appointment in a statement , in which it also said it was confident " an expeditious , full and fair investigation will be conducted , and appropriate action will be taken in response to this incident			1
" while the identities of the people on the video have n't been released , the leadership of the @entity130 2nd @entity129 " is confident those are their @entity13 , " according to a @entity13 official with direct knowledge of the initial investigation			1
the official , based in @entity4 , spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue			0
the unit , based at @entity140 , @entity141 , deployed in february or march and returned in september or october			0
while in @entity4 , the unit was based primarily in @entity142			0
officials in the @entity3 and @entity4 expressed shock and outrage over the video			1
" i have seen the footage , and i find the behavior depicted in it utterly deplorable , " @entity3 defense secretary @entity147 said in a statement			1
" i condemn it in the strongest possible terms			0
" marine corps commandant gen. @entity153 said that the behavior is " wholly inconsistent with the high standards of conduct and warrior ethos that we have demonstrated throughout our history			0
" president @entity160 knows about the video , said @entity163 spokesman @entity162			2
he said he did n't know whether @entity160 had viewed it			0
" what it apparently depicts is deplorable , reprehensible and unacceptable , " @entity162 said			0
@entity4 president @entity167 called on the @entity3 government to investigate and hand down the harshest punishment possible			1
" this act by @entity3 soldiers is simply inhuman and condemnable in the strongest possible terms , " the statement from @entity167 's office said			2
a @entity38 spokesman called the video " barbaric			2
" " this inhuman act reveals their real face to the world , " spokesman @entity176 said via text message thursday			0
the video surfaces at a critical time for relations among the @entity3 , the @entity4 government and the @entity38			1
last year , the @entity3 outlined its plan to withdraw its troops from @entity4 , beginning by pulling out 33,000 " surge " troops who had been deployed to help quell the violence by the end of 2012			1
the remaining 68,000 troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2014			0
meanwhile , the @entity38 tentatively agreed in recent weeks to open an office in @entity196 's capital city of @entity197 , a decision widely seen as an overture aimed at establishing an outside forum for political talks with @entity23 - led forces and the current @entity4 administration , among others			0
