-- the careers of @entity3 oligarchs who have sought to wield power against the @entity5 in the media or politics have not tended to go far			1
@entity8 , an oil magnate who backed an opposition party , has been in jail since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 on charges of tax evasion and fraud			2
@entity16 and @entity17 , both of whom owned media outlets that were critical of the government , fled the country			1
during the 1990s , it was common for oligarchs to oppose the @entity5 , said @entity25 , director of the @entity26 , @entity3 and @entity27 at @entity28			2
but once @entity33 became president in 2000 , " he started making examples of high - profile business people / oligarchs , " @entity25 said			0
@entity8 , once @entity3 's richest man , was building an organization that could have served as a platform from which to challenge @entity33 in 2004 , @entity25 said			1
" his real sin was mobilizing a campaign that seemed aimed at the presidency , " he added			0
@entity8 's jailing in 2004 " served as an example for most of the others , " @entity25 said			1
" you did n't see many other big business people openly challenging the government since that time			0
" instead , wealthy @entity3 have been careful not to draw the @entity5 's ire , he said			1
" they either laid low or supported the @entity5 's leadership actively			1
" now , it 's @entity51 , the owner of the @entity52 whose $ 18 billion puts him among the world 's richest people and who announced monday he is running to replace @entity33			1
profile : who is @entity51 ? though @entity51 is unlikely to topple the incumbent , his fate could prove more benign than that of many of his fellow oligarchs , said @entity62 , professor of @entity3 studies and history at @entity65			1
" he would not do it without the support of @entity33 or the men around @entity33 , " said @entity62 in a telephone interview			2
" he 's not an independent actor ... his wealth is still dependent on @entity5 approval			1
" @entity51 , like all the oligarchs who remain in @entity3 with their wealth intact , has made political and probably financial accommodations with the @entity5 , said @entity62 , author of " @entity76			1
" among @entity51 's assets are vast mineral holdings that remain underground			1
" he 'd like to sell them outright , or at least a controlling share of them , to @entity83 countries so he can cash in while his political standing is ok , " @entity62 said			0
but companies in the @entity86 will not deal with him or any other oligarch unless a commission established in @entity3 for such investment approves it , he said			0
" and the chairman of the commission is @entity33			0
" that means @entity51 is unlikely to do anything to offend @entity33 , @entity62 said			2
so , why is he running against him ? as things now stand , @entity33 will be running against @entity95 , the longtime leader of the @entity96 , which represents the only real electoral opposition in the country , according to @entity62			2
though not well - funded , the party is well - organized and efficient and could make @entity95 a more formidable opponent at the polls by the march election , @entity62 said			0
that scenario is even more likely if @entity95 benefits from protest votes by the thousands of @entity3 who have taken to the streets in recent days , @entity62 said			0
if the demonstrators and their sympathizers are members of the affluent middle class , as some observers have suggested , " then it would make sense to give them somebody other than the @entity111 to vote for -- if you 're looking to divide the @entity114 vote , " he said			0
" they 'll vote for the so - called successful businessman			0
" demonstrations challenge @entity33 's hold on power @entity51 's candidacy would likely draw the @entity114 vote away from the @entity111 and divide the opposition , @entity62 said			1
" they think they know what they 're doing , and i guess they do , " he added			0
but @entity25 was not persuaded that @entity51 's candidacy is fake			1
" conspiracy theories sometimes , actually , are just conspiracy theories , " he said in a telephone interview			0
" in this particular case , it seems to be real			0
" citing the civil unrest shaking @entity3 , he said , " people like him are sensing now 's the time to criticize the @entity5			1
still , @entity25 acknowledged , @entity51 appears to have hedged his bets			2
" he has criticized people around @entity33 , but not @entity33 himself			0
" but even if pseudo-candidates wind up in the election , that 's not necessarily a bad omen for democracy , @entity62 said			2
more choice " is the foundation of a democratic system , " he added			0
one reason that suggests @entity51 may be sincere in his putative effort to unseat @entity33 is the fact that his sister runs quasi-academic journals financed by her brother that are frequently critical of the @entity5 , said @entity154 , a professor of government at @entity156			1
but he , too , said it was not clear			0
" it 's an important story ; i wish we knew what the hell was going on , " he said in a telephone interview .			2

@entity8 's jailing " served as an example , " professor says
@entity51 would not run without @entity5 's support , professor says
@entity172 and @entity17 fled the country
