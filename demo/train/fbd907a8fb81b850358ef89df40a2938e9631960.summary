-- the news that @entity2 , @entity3 , is pregnant is being celebrated throughout @entity4 , the @entity5 and beyond			0
as well as wonderful news for the royal couple , it has positive implications for the future of the @entity4 monarchy			2
it means that the reigning @entity13 of @entity13 will have , for the first time since 1894 , no fewer than three generations in line to the throne at the same time			1
as early into this century as we are , it effectively means that the succession is secure even into the next one			1
whether the royal couple 's new baby is a boy or a girl , he or she will ascend the throne as monarch one day , come what may -- short of a republican revolution			1
the @entity5 changed the law this year , meaning sex discrimination will end and males will not be favored over females , as they have been for the past thousand years			2
news : baby news sparks media frenzy although we ca n't know what the child 's name will be , we can be sure that he or she will have a lot of them : some heirs to the throne had as many as seven or eight			1
should they have a girl , it would be surprising if the names @entity50 , after her great - grandmother @entity50 and great - great - grandmother queen elizabeth the queen mother , and @entity52 , after her paternal grandmother , are missing from the list			1
yet the bookmakers ' predictions for a boy 's name -- @entity59 , at 10 to 1 ; and @entity60 , at 8 to 1 -- are very unlikely			0
@entity59 is already taken as the name of prince @entity63 's father , and @entity60 was one of the worst kings in @entity4 history			0
any concerns that prince @entity67 might one day have ascended the @entity4 throne -- he was third in line and will soon be fourth -- have been allayed by this announcement			1
granted , he was a brave soldier who saw action fighting against the @entity72 in @entity73 , but he was not really considered suitable material for a king			0
the knowledge that @entity2 can have children removes the danger that a future @entity67 might embarrass the nation with his naked hijinks and @entity82 antics			0
what we do know is that the child will be brought up in the harshest of media spotlights and will remain in its full flood for a lifetime			2
bookmakers already are taking bets on the color of the baby 's hair			2
to exist in this gilded cage will require a firm sense of self and a strong personality			1
many people might be hurt psychologically by the relentless publicity accompanying every move they make , but prince @entity63 has demonstrated that such attention does not necessarily lead to problems			0
news : royal baby announcement marks dramatic break with tradition the @entity4 state is far more protective toward its royals than it was in the days of @entity59 and princess @entity52 , and it is fully conscious of the disasters that can arise when the paparazzi are in full pursuit			1
the public , too , despises those who invade the younger royals ' private lives , although admittedly that has not stopped people from buying the newspapers and visiting the websites responsible for the worst excesses			0
in a sense , all monarchy is a lottery , in that nobody can tell whether a sovereign will turn out well or ill. a large number of the best ones -- @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity50 -- were not necessarily going to be king or queen when they were born			1
some who were born to be king -- such as @entity140 , later @entity141 -- turned out to be disappointments			2
with @entity50 , @entity4 won the lottery , and it seems as though the present popularity of the monarchy itself , which opinion polls show to be at its highest in more than a quarter - century , is very much down to her and prince @entity63			1
although 1992 was an " annus horribilis " for the queen , when @entity150 suffered a terrible fire and two of her children 's marriages collapsed , 2012 has been a wonderful 12 months , more than making up for it two decades later			0
the @entity156 was spectacular , proving yet again how much the @entity4 people love her			0
the @entity159 were a huge success			1
and the future of her dynasty seems on the verge of being confirmed throughout this century and beyond			0
there will be talk , inevitably , of whether the queen or perhaps the future @entity168 might abdicate , to avoid a situation in which the next three monarchs will be advanced in years			0
if the queen has inherited her mother 's longevity , she will easily beat @entity50 @entity132 's time on the throne , and become -- in september 2015 -- the longest - reigning monarch in history			1
abdication is not in her job description : she considers it a dereliction of duty , something that disgraced her uncle @entity140 with the family			0
if she lives as long as the @entity185 , she will still be on the throne in 2027 , which will almost inevitably mean that her successor @entity168 would have one of the shorter reigns , as he would be nearly 80 when he acceded			1
arguments about elderly monarchs have been made before in the reign of @entity50 @entity132 , yet it did n't prevent the present queen coming to the throne aged only 25 only half a century later , after the deaths of three more monarchs in the meantime			1
part of the lottery of monarchy is that one can not predict the future , and the job only makes sense if it is for life			2
one of the strengths of having a family serve as successive heads of state is that when a bad chapter ends , a better one can begin			0
with the birth of what would have been her first grandchild , the shade of princess @entity52 's era is forever behind the @entity13 , and the @entity4 people can look forward to a new generation of royals			0
small wonder that @entity4 and the world are celebrating with @entity63 and @entity3			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 : when royal baby is born , three generations will be in line to the throne
seeing how long @entity50 has reigned , he says , succession could last whole century
@entity223 : child will need a firm sense of self to *withstand* the pressure of royal life
*jubilee* , @entity159 and pregnancy *cap* a great year for @entity50 , he says
