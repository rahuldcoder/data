@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , who is set to die next week before @entity1 's firing squad , said something thursday he did n't plan to : he supports capital punishment			1
but , @entity3 told the five - member @entity7 , he thinks the death penalty needs to be " as fair as you can get it			1
" testifying at his commutation hearing , @entity3 said he accepts responsibility for killing two men and seriously wounding a third			1
but , he added , executing him on june 18 would not be fair because he 's never had the chance to present evidence in court that might have swayed jurors from a death sentence			1
@entity3 choked up as he said he has n't been able to apologize to the families of his victims , saying they do n't want to hear from him			1
he did not take that opportunity to apologize to the family members who were in the audience at the hearing			1
" it makes me sad , " he said , wiping his eyes			2
" i know killing me is going to hurt them just as bad , " he said			2
" i 've been on the other side of the gun			0
" now 49 , @entity3 is scheduled to be executed june 18 by firing squad for the murder of attorney @entity35 during an escape attempt at a @entity0 courthouse			1
@entity3 , who had a long history of violence and escape , was at the courthouse on april 2 , 1985 , for a pretrial hearing in the 1984 slaying of @entity43			1
he was killed at the @entity0 bar where he was working to earn extra money			0
an acquaintance handed @entity3 a gun at the courthouse ; he fatally shot @entity35 , who was there for another case , and shot and wounded bailiff @entity50			1
friends and relatives of his victims were split thursday on whether @entity3 deserves to die			1
" @entity35 would not have wanted @entity3 killed , " @entity54 , @entity35 's fianc√©e , tearfully testified			1
" i 'm asking to honor his wishes and commute the sentence to life without parole			0
" but @entity59 , @entity43 's cousin , called for @entity3 's execution			1
he testified that @entity43 died while @entity3 was robbing the @entity62 bar , walking away with less than $ 100			1
@entity3 fired a gun in @entity43 's face and " blew his head off , " @entity59 said			1
" in our minds , he did it just for fun			0
" @entity50 's daughter , @entity71 , sobbed as she recalled how her father 's shooting resulted in years of pain and five surgeries for him , and left him unable to go fishing and camping -- activities they previously had enjoyed as a family			2
" that was the day that ruined my life , " her father , who died in 1995 , said of the day he was shot , @entity81 testified			0
@entity43 's son said he does n't know what sentence his father 's killer should receive			2
" i 've been told stories of how much my dad loved me , how he was a wonderful father , " said @entity90 , who was 3 when his father was killed			0
" i will never know			0
i will never know him			0
" @entity43 said he is torn about whether to support the death penalty or life in prison without parole for @entity3			1
whatever decision is made , he said , it should be permanent			2
" our families need peace			0
our families deserve the opportunity to place this action in the past			0
" closing arguments are set for friday in the hearing , and the board will deliver its decision on monday			1
@entity3 's attorney , @entity111 , pointed out that jurors in the @entity35 murder trial were not given the option of deciding to sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole			1
@entity111 said it was suggested during the trial that if jurors did n't sentence @entity3 to death , he might one day be released			1
@entity3 pleaded guilty to second - degree murder in @entity43 's death and the @entity35 jury was not told of the judge 's recommendation in that case that he never be freed from prison , @entity111 said			1
jurors also did not hear about @entity3 's childhood , marked by poverty , neglect and abuse ; his use of inhalants beginning at about age 6 ; and his being institutionalized in a mental hospital at age 10 or 11			1
@entity138 , a professor of psychiatry at the @entity140 , @entity140 , said he has studied many death - row prisoners , nearly all of whom have had disadvantaged childhoods			2
" i can tell you that mr. @entity3 's life stands among the very worst , " he testified			1
@entity3 's mother asked to be sterilized after his birth , he said , telling hospital personnel she could not care for the children she already had			2
in 1963 , @entity3 , then 2 , was found wandering in the street , clad only in a diaper			2
the record of neglect " never wavered and it never varied " throughout @entity3 's childhood , @entity138 said			2
while social workers and others made frequent notes of the situation , no one appears to have done anything to rectify it			0
his placement in the mental hospital at age 10 or 11 came not because of mental illness , @entity138 said			0
instead , it stemmed from a need to keep @entity3 away from his family and , authorities noted , introduce him to a " normal " way of life			1
doctors at the hospital noted that @entity3 was already addicted to sniffing glue and paint , which could have caused brain damage , @entity138 said			2
the account painted a picture of a little boy who felt stupid , unloved and with no place in the world			0
but it did not move @entity184 , bailiff @entity50 's widow , who plans to witness @entity3 's execution			2
while many people have bad childhoods , she said afterward , they overcome it			0
" he just wants to get out , " she said of @entity3			2
while he may have had disadvantages , she said , " he knew right and wrong			0
that 's all you need to know			0
" @entity3 testified that he realizes he will spend the rest of his life in prison if he is not executed			1
" i have changed , " he said , noting that he -- once a " nasty little bugger " -- has had no discipline problems in prison in the last five years and only minor incidents in the last decade			0
" it was just time to grow up and accept what i 've done , " he said			0
@entity54 told reporters she was never angry about the murder of the man she planned to marry			0
" @entity35 ... believed in life			0
he did n't believe that when you die , it 's over , " she said			0
@entity211 is a member of @entity213 , a @entity0 - based religious movement , as was @entity35			0
belief blog : what is @entity213 ? @entity3 's execution , she added , is not going to bring peace to the victims ' families			1
" closure does n't come from the outside , " she said			0
" it comes from the inside			0
