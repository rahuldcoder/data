@entity0 -- when @entity3 steps down as leader of @entity6 's @entity5 this month , not everyone will view his record over the last 10 years favorably			1
@entity8 told , it 's a record of rapid social and economic changes punctuated by political turmoil , disaster and crackdowns			0
working in tandem with premier @entity15 , the 69 - year - old @entity3 is credited for solidifying @entity6 's position as a rising global power			1
but @entity3 also has his share of critics			1
" although the reform and opening has given the party huge fortune , the distribution of wealth has been extremely uneven , " said @entity20 , from the @entity21 at @entity22 in @entity6			2
" @entity6 as a nation has become richer and stronger , " said @entity29 , a white - collar worker in @entity0			2
" but many people are not feeling rich and strong			0
it seems prosperity has not trickled down much			0
" " @entity34 , minqiong " -- the nation has become richer , the people poorer -- this is one popular assessment of @entity3 's time in office			2
that rings ironic , observers say , given @entity3 's image as a populist politician			2
an engineer with extensive experience in @entity6 's poor , underdeveloped interior provinces , @entity3 worked his way up the ranks of the party through the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , a training ground of party cadres that now boasts about 70 million members			1
from the @entity50 , @entity3 was appointed as party chief in @entity6 's impoverished western provinces of @entity56 and @entity57			1
in 1992 , he was singled out by paramount leader @entity58 for promotion as the " core " of the younger generation , strategically given a place in the elite @entity63			0
five years later , he became the youngest member of the @entity63 's @entity65 -- the country 's elite decision - making body -- lining him up as the presumptive leader of the " fourth generation			2
" he took charge at the @entity71 in 2002 when he succeeded president @entity72 as @entity5 chief , before taking over as state president the following year			0
@entity3 has tried to carve out his legacy by championing the country 's " scientific development , " a catchphrase for his policies , which sought more balanced , equitable and sustainable development , rather than breakneck economic growth as pursued by his predecessor , @entity82			2
@entity3 's program called for increased social spending to help poor or unemployed farmers and urban workers to ensure social stability , or " weiwen			1
" in the last party congress five years ago , @entity3 managed to amend the party 's constitution to include his scientific development mantra			2
it was widely viewed as a sign that he had consolidated his power five years after succeeding @entity82			0
under @entity3 's watch , @entity6 has become the world 's second largest economy			1
the @entity99 estimates its gdp to be $ 7.318 billion , as factors such as low labor costs and an undervalued currency combined to boost economic growth between 2003 and 2007			0
he is also credited with improving the country 's military and boosting national pride			0
in 2008 , @entity6 hosted the @entity108 , putting the spotlight on @entity6 's emergence as a world power			1
in june this year , @entity6 completed its first manned space docking -- a significant milestone in its bid to construct a space station -- and sent its first female astronaut into orbit , only the third country ever to do so			0
in october , @entity6 sent its first aircraft carrier to sea , emblematic of @entity6 's growing ability to project its military power beyond its borders			1
but @entity3 has always advocated @entity6 's " peaceful rise , " which observers take to mean building a prosperous and " harmonious society			1
" critics say he has failed to achieve this goal			0
" in these 10 years , @entity6 is nothing close to harmonious , " said @entity20			0
" conflicts and contradictions have become worse			0
in fact it is reaching a crisis point			0
" when faced with ethnic unrest in @entity57 in 2008 and the restive @entity136 province in western @entity6 in 2009 , @entity3 showed his steely side by cracking down harshly , using the police and the military , and censoring related content on the @entity141			1
@entity3 's regime likewise showed little tolerance towards political opposition , rounding up the most vocal dissidents and social activists , putting them in prison , under house arrest or making them disappear for weeks			2
the most prominent victims of political repression include @entity152 peace laureate @entity151 and his wife @entity153 , @entity155 awardee @entity154 , artist @entity156 , and blind activist @entity157			0
under @entity3 , @entity6 has kept a tight control of the media , especially the country 's huge social media community			1
in march , for example , @entity141 regulators required the 300 million microbloggers on @entity165 , @entity6 's @entity166 - like service , to register their real names on posts to make then more accountable			1
" post- 2007 , @entity3 strengthened the coercive arm of the state , " said @entity169 , political professor at the @entity170			0
but @entity3 has failed to narrow the country 's widening wealth gap			2
speaking at the @entity176 in @entity177 in june , @entity6 's @entity175 said his country still has more than 100 million people living below the poverty line -- despite the size of its economy			1
a study earlier this year by @entity184 in @entity6 found that @entity6 's top 10 % of households surveyed have 57 % of the total income and 85 % of total assets			1
recent years have seen a growing rural - urban disparity with millions moving to cities to improve their income prospects			0
meanwhile , those who believed @entity3 would open up @entity6 's political system would be likewise disappointed			1
he has called @entity196 - style democracy a " blind alley " and has resisted pressure to pursue even the most modest reform of the political system			0
with little transparency , accountability and pluralism , the @entity5 under @entity3 has made little progress in curbing endemic corruption in the party and the government			2
" @entity3 is seen to have been weak leader , missing opportunities , and putting excessive concern for order , his so - called ' hexie shehui ' ( harmonious society ) , " said @entity169			1
" criticisms ( of @entity3 's rule ) have even come from the @entity215 , where @entity216 is president			1
" @entity216 , the state 's current vice president , is expected to take over from @entity3 as general secretary of the party at end of the @entity221			1
yet the months leading up to the congress have brought fractious back - room bargaining among the party elite , which is divided between informal " elitist " and " populist " factions			0
@entity216 's ability to enforce unity at the top will determine how the new leadership will manage @entity6 's emergence as a global superpower and how it copes with its domestic problems			1
" demand from below for change is great , " said @entity169			0
" but @entity216 may have to wait until he consolidates his power before he could push his own reform package			0
" that , he added , may take the 59 year old several months , or even one or two years .			0

@entity3 will be stepping down as @entity6 's leader at the 18th @entity241
likely to be *replaced* by his current vice president , @entity216
@entity3 presided over @entity6 as it became the world 's second biggest economy
however critics point to growing rich - poor divide , corruption , *authoritarian* rule
