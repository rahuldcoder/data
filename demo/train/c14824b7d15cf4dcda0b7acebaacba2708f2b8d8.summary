@entity1 law regarding the death penalty often feels like a cultural remnant from the days of cowboys and the @entity5 : you kill ; you get killed			1
in a recent @entity10 article , the headline included the phrase , " confronted on @entity12 , @entity7 says it kills efficiently			0
" the language feels like an understatement considering that 515 inmates have been put to death in @entity1 since 1982 , about 60 % of the national total			1
unfortunately , efficiency does not equate with accuracy			0
@entity21 , for example , was convicted of murder and rape			0
his defense attorneys , however , during his trial in @entity1 were not allowed to introduce evidence that indicated he was intellectually disabled and struggled with right and wrong			1
a prosecution expert , arguing for death , said @entity21 might be dangerous in the future " because he is black			2
" these factors prompted a federal appeals court to stay @entity21 's tuesday execution and allow the introduction of additional evidence at new sentencing hearing			0
@entity39 , who is white , has had a different experience with @entity1 justice			1
@entity39 shot an 81 - year - old woman in the back and then stuffed her body into a freezer while he continued to live in her home			0
although he spent 17 years in prison , @entity39 was recently released when the court reconsidered his childhood sexual abuse , the kind of mitigating circumstance not allowed to be part of the record in @entity21 's original trial			0
@entity39 's story was turned into the movie " @entity39 " by @entity58 filmmaker @entity57 , who has given the new parolee a home and arranged for a job			0
the @entity62 , a politics and government news site , wrote two extensive stories about @entity57 and @entity39 , which gave the killer a sympathetic profile and suggested that parole was a form of justice			0
@entity57 has contributed $ 10,000 to the news site , according to its own records			0
when @entity1 was recently preparing to execute a convicted cop killer from @entity76 who had an iq of 67 , i thought of a former prosecutor i knew			2
in a similar case , he had said , " if @entity76 does n't want its citizens executed in @entity1 , they should warn them not to kill people while they are here			1
" @entity1 comedian @entity84 has joked that while other states are eliminating the death penalty , " we 've been putting in an express lane			1
" @entity84 is right , but @entity1 is often wrong			2
according to the @entity90 , dna evidence has exonerated and led to the release of 15 accused killers since 1972			0
the list of what are often called the top 10 infamous cases of wrongful execution includes five victims from @entity1 ' death row			1
two of those provide more than sufficient cause to reconsider capital punishment			0
@entity103 , who was executed in 2000 , was sitting in a car when an accomplice killed a liquor store owner during a robbery in 1990			2
the only admissible evidence against @entity103 was a hair found at the site of the crime			0
dna forensics could not prove it was his , but less than a decade later , improved techniques showed that it was the victim 's hair , not @entity103 '			0
regardless , @entity1 gov. @entity118 and appeals courts denied @entity103 a reprieve , and he was executed			1
@entity121 met the same fate in 2004 after being convicted of killing his three young daughters by setting their home on fire			0
the @entity126 investigated the arson evidence against @entity121 and concluded that the findings were a product of " flawed " processes , five years after he had been put to death in @entity133			2
his family has spent the past two years seeking a posthumous pardon from the state but has met with as much denial as during his appeals process			2
there is sufficient injustice to go around in @entity1 , but the death penalty , undeniably , is infected with racism			1
in @entity144 , prosecutors are three times more likely to seek the death penalty for @entity148 defendants over white suspects , according to a study last year by the @entity151 , which looked at 500 cases in @entity153 , the state 's most populous legal jurisdiction			1
professor @entity156 , a criminologist with 35 years of experience , concluded that @entity144 juries sought the death penalty only 20 % of the time when the defendant was white and 70 % for blacks			1
increasingly , however , sentiments are shifting			2
we are not likely to grant reprieves to death row inmates , but @entity167 are beginning to acknowledge inequalities in the administration of executions and the possibility of mistakes			1
racial injustices may be why support for the death penalty is showing faltering support in @entity1 , particularly among an increasingly diverse population			1
a survey released last month by the @entity179 of @entity144 showed that 69 % of the city 's residents favor an alternative to execution			0
figures indicate that 39 % prefer life without parole as an option , and only 28 % backed the death penalty			1
those numbers reflect the fact that @entity144 has become the most racially diverse large city in the @entity192 now constitute a minority in every age demographic except people over the age of 65			0
race , though , continues to be , unquestionably , a factor in @entity1 justice			2
although blacks are fewer than 12 % of the population , they make up more than 37 % of the state 's 500 - plus executions since the law was reinstated			1
regardless of those disturbing statistics , @entity1 remains very efficient at carrying out the death penalty			1
just not as proficient at delivering justice .			0

@entity1 has executed about 500 people since the 1980s , more than any other state
@entity214 says the death penalty in @entity1 is infected with racism
blacks make up fewer than 12 % of @entity167 , but they *'re* 37 % of its executions
@entity214 : as @entity1 ' population diversifies , sentiments are shifting about death penalty
