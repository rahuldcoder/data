-- once in a while , along a steady reach of the wide @entity3 some 70 miles east of @entity4 , the local corn farmers will pause in their labors for a huge rumbling sound , a thunder of jet engines shaking the willows and cottonwoods and the gliding stillness of the stream			0
moments later , from behind long razor - wire fences , and rising from an invisible runway folded among the cornfields , a great gray bomber will slowly lumber upwards and hoist itself up into the skies			0
it is always an awesome sight -- all the more so if other planes follow , and the singleton becomes part of an airborne armada , a squadron of unimaginable power bound on an unannounced mission to a place seldom disclosed , for a purpose rarely to be known			0
and as the craft vanish into the clouds , and the thunder ebbs away over the woods , so the awestruck locals must wonder : just what corner of the planet is this day destined to be basking under the unasked - for invigilation of these nuclear - tipped watchers from @entity41 's skies			1
for this , in the trails of burned jet fuel scarring the @entity45 skies , is a closeup of the face of today 's @entity41 exceptionalism			1
the bombers come from @entity51 , home to the unit that once bombed @entity53 and @entity54 , an always battle - ready line of @entity57 stealth aircraft that its commander proudly says can now deliver massive firepower to bear , in a short time , anywhere on the globe			0
the crews sent two planes to @entity65 last spring to warn the saber - rattling @entity65 dictator to keep in line			0
they currently stand armed and ready to deploy a squadron to @entity70 , should their commander - in - chief issue the order			0
and should they be told to fly to @entity74 , or to @entity75 again , or to @entity76 , so they will unpack their charts and load their bombs and cannons and rumble off down the @entity51 runways			0
they are the outward manifestation of the still closely held belief that @entity41 , unique in all the world , has a prescriptive right to send weapons of unrivaled might to any place on the surface of the planet , to make sure inhabitants there behave themselves , and march steadily to a tune conducted by the @entity41			1
but -- why ? this , essentially , was what @entity96 was asking in his now - infamous @entity100 op - ed essay			1
just why does @entity41 still believe that it has a right and a duty to police the world ? why does @entity41 consider itself so different -- so sufficiently exceptional as to have a perpetual duty of care for all major happenings around the globe ? without excusing this reality , i would argue that this idea was actually born , two centuries ago , in places just like the far west of @entity3 , just where the @entity51 base is hidden			1
it is a geographical irony based on the existence in such places of a phenomenon long since vanished : the frontier			2
when @entity118 passed by -- and just near where the base is now , @entity118 wrote in 1804 of having seen " an emence snake ... that gobbles like a turkey " -- this was very much the frontier			2
behind the men , back east , were the beginnings of civilization : towns , roads , governments , the law			2
ahead was uncharted and untamed wilderness			1
behind were traders , farmers , settlers , surveyors ; beyond were empty prairies , nomads , lawlessness			0
and according to some this vague frontier line , shifting ever westward for much of the next century as the nation was opened up , instilled something unique in the @entity41 character			1
a @entity144 history professor named @entity145 first advanced the idea : that those tested by the frontier experience were a people more violent , more informal , more democratic , more imbued with personal initiative and less hamstrung by tradition , class and elegance			2
more @entity41 , @entity145 suggested			2
strength , power , might -- the ability to tame rather than to persuade , the tendency to demand rather than request , the tendency to shoot rather than to talk -- these were all tendencies compounded by the frontier experience , uniquely different building - blocks employed the making of the modern @entity41			1
the @entity172 myth , the legends of the cowboy , the cinematic and entertainment park allure of concepts like @entity168 -- all of these were born from this single simple -- some would say simplistic -- thesis offered up by @entity145			0
since then the theory has been much derided -- @entity145 , it is argued , paid no heed to such matters as race , gender and regionalism			0
and yet it seems to me much of what he argued still does have a measure of common sense to it			0
for @entity41 are different : the notions of @entity191 and the vision of @entity41 as the shining city on the hill , surely do owe something at least to the frontier mentality			1
and i would argue that this mentality , if such a thing exists , still also plays a nourishing role at the intellectual roots of much of today 's @entity41 foreign policy			1
there is much more to it , of course			0
@entity41 foreign policy may well be driven nowadays more by corporate greed than by a frontier - tested belief in noble ideals			1
but @entity96 , by learning a little more about this country 's remarkable past , might also come to have a more sympathetic understanding about why it is the nature of @entity41 to believe they are truly unusual , with a unique role to play in the world , and to have little patience with those who wish it were otherwise			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			2

@entity220 : @entity41 's *military* patrols the world , unlike that of any other nation
he says the belief in @entity41 exceptionalism goes back to the frontier days
@entity41 saw themselves as tamers of an uncharted , untamed wilderness , he says
@entity235 : @entity96 could learn a lot about exceptionalism if he studied @entity41 history
