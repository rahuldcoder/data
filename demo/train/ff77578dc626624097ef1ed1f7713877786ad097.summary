he is said to be terminally ill with bladder cancer , prompting speculation that @entity0 may have been spared a corruption probe and prosecution due to his condition			0
his sympathizers had been pushing for leniency , sources said , arguing that the terminal cancer was a fate equal to the death penalty			0

that is not the signal @entity10 wants to send			1
mosquitoes and tigers @entity10 , who is also chairman of the @entity3 , has vowed to clean up the tarnished image of @entity84 and the @entity1			1
he has pushed big anti-graft campaigns , pledging to target not just " mosquitoes " ( minor officials ) but also " tigers " ( top officials )			0
