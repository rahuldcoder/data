-- @entity2 co-founder @entity1 is very softly spoken			1
the tech titan , now chief executive of mobile payments company @entity5 , is an observer who pays close attention to everything that goes on around him			2

@entity1 , now a billionaire and one of the world 's most influential tech brains , grew up in @entity49 , @entity50 , with parents who were running small coffee and pizza businesses			1
