@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 scientists have unveiled a working prototype of a fully artificial heart which is based on the technology of satellites and airplanes			1
the artificial heart based on satellite and airplane technology was presented in @entity13			1
the device could save millions of lives and beats almost exactly like the real thing using electronic sensors to regulate heart rate and blood flow			1
developers @entity21 , funded by the @entity24 space and defense group @entity22 , presented the device at a press conference in @entity13 on monday			0
@entity28 's chief operating officer @entity27 told @entity29 : " it 's the same principle in the airplane as in the body			0
" @entity27 explained that the same tiny sensors that measure air pressure and altitude in an airplane or satellite are also in the artificial heart			1
this should allow the device to respond immediately if the patient needs more or less blood			0
the @entity4 design has so far only been tested in animals , and now needs approval from its authorities before pushing ahead with clinical trials			2
previous artificial hearts have been unable to automatically vary their pumping speed and must be tweaked externally			0
the @entity4 heart is also the most lifelike , with two pumps to send the blood into the lungs and the rest of the body , just like a real heart			2
past artificial hearts have only had one pump			0
the @entity4 model is made from natural materials including polymer and pig tissue , which have already been used in heart valves implanted into people			2
the artificial heart would initially be for patients who had suffered a massive heart attack or who had heart failure , but might eventually be used in patients who are not that sick			1
heart disease is the world 's top killer , claiming some 17 million lives a year			1
according to the @entity76 , about 2,200 heart transplants were performed in the @entity77 in 2006			0
thousands more patients would benefit if more donor hearts were available			0
the artificial heart is expected to cost about 150,000 euros or $ 192,140 .			2

@entity4 scientists have unveiled a working prototype of a fully artificial heart
the design is based on the technology of satellites and airplanes
it could save millions of lives as heart disease kills 17 million a year
