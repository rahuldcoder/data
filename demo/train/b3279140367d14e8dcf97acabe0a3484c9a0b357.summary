-- a @entity2 court ordered wednesday that 9 - year - old @entity4 be returned to the custody of his father , @entity6 , in the @entity7 , but his @entity2 relatives were expected to try to block the order , a @entity2 official said			1
outside his home in @entity11 , @entity4 told reporters he was heartened by the news , but would not consider his efforts successful until he and the boy are reunited			2
" i 'm hopeful , " he said			0
" i ca n't be optimistic because i 've gone down there so many times , always under the guise that the rule of law will be followed and @entity4 will come home to me and his family , and that does n't happen			1
" the 3 - 0 ruling by the @entity24 in @entity25 upheld a june decision by the 16th @entity27 in @entity25 , which ordered @entity4 returned to his home in @entity11 in accordance with the 1980 @entity29 on the @entity30			1
but a @entity2 official with knowledge of the case predicted wednesday 's order would be appealed			1
so far , the boy 's @entity2 family has filed 40 appeals , most of them procedural but one substantive			1
the @entity2 high court is to take up any appeal on thursday , said rep. @entity42 , @entity43 , who has been pressing the case for his constituent			2
" frankly , every possible nuance has been appealed by the other side , " he told @entity0 's " @entity48			0
" " remember , this is an abducting family , they 're kidnappers , but they have had a great deal of sway with the court			0
" the @entity54 could still allow @entity4 to be returned to his father in the @entity7 while it decides any appeal			2
@entity4 , a former model , said he had last spoken with his son in june , but they did not discuss the custody battle			1
the case began in 2004 , when his wife , @entity4 , took their 4 - year - old son from their home in @entity11 to @entity25 for what was to have been a two - week vacation			1
she never returned , instead remarrying there and retaining custody of their son			0
she died last year in childbirth			0
@entity73 has argued that , as the sole surviving parent , he should be granted custody			0
but the boy 's stepfather and his other @entity2 relatives have argued that it would be traumatizing to the boy to remove him from what has been his home for most of his life			2
the case has drawn high - profile input , including pressure for the boy 's return from secretary of state @entity90 , who said wednesday in a statement that she was pleased to hear about the decision			0
" we appreciate the assistance and cooperation of the government of @entity2 in upholding its obligations under the @entity99 , " she said			0
" and it is my hope that this long legal process is now complete and that the @entity73 family will be reunited quickly			1
