-- @entity2 president @entity1 will meet with president @entity3 on friday to discuss the post- 2014 @entity5 presence in @entity2			1
the @entity5 military has already given @entity3 options under which as few as 6,000 or as many as 20,000 soldiers would remain in @entity2 after 2014			2
those forces would work as advisers to the @entity2 army and mount special operations raids against the @entity13 and @entity14			2

this may be a negotiating ploy by the @entity3 administration as it gets down to some hard bargaining with @entity1 , who has long criticized many aspects of the @entity5 military presence and who is likely to be reluctant to accede to a key @entity5 demand : that any @entity5 soldiers who remain in @entity2 after 2014 retain immunity from prosecution in the dysfunctional @entity2 court system			1
it was this issue that led the @entity5 to pull all its troops out of @entity39 in december , 2011 after failing to negotiate an agreement with the @entity42 government			0
read more : defense officials to press @entity1 on what he needs or this may represent the real views of those in the @entity3 administration who have long called for a much - reduced @entity5 presence in @entity2 , and it is also in keeping with the emerging @entity3 doctrine of attacking @entity14 and its allies with drones but no @entity5 boots on the ground			0
and it certainly aligns with the view of most @entity5 , only around a quarter of whom now support the war in @entity2 , according to a poll taken in september			0
security clearance : @entity2 options emerge in any case , zeroing out @entity5 troop levels in the post- 2014 @entity2 is a bad idea on its face -- and even raising this concept publicly is maladroit strategic messaging to @entity2 and the region writ large			2
why so ? afghans well remember something that most @entity5 have forgotten			0
after the @entity71 withdrew from @entity2 , something that was accomplished at the cost of more than a million @entity2 lives and billions of dollars of @entity5 aid , the @entity5 closed its embassy in @entity2 in 1989 during the @entity78 administration and then zeroed out aid to one of the poorest countries in the world under the @entity84 administration			0
it essentially turned its back on @entity2 once they had served their purpose of dealing a deathblow to the @entity71			0
as a result , the @entity5 had virtually no understanding of the subsequent vacuum in @entity2 into which eventually stepped the @entity13 , who rose to power in the mid- 1990s			1
the @entity13 granted shelter to @entity95 and his @entity14 organization from 1996 onward			0

the relatively small number of @entity5 boots on the ground in @entity2 helped to create a vacuum of security in the country , which the @entity13 would deftly exploit , so that by 2007 , they once again posed a significant military threat in @entity2			1
in 2009 , @entity3 ordered a surge of 30,000 troops into @entity2 to blunt the @entity13 's gathering momentum , which it has certainly accomplished			2
read more : inside the @entity13 but when @entity3 announced the new troops of the @entity2 surge , most media accounts of the speech seized on the fact that the president also said that some of those troops would be coming home in july 2011			2
this had the unintended effect of signaling to the @entity13 that the @entity5 was pulling out of @entity2 reasonably soon and fit into the longstanding narrative that many @entity2 have that the @entity5 will abandon them again			1
similarly , the current public discussion of zero @entity5 troop presence in @entity2 after 2014 will encourage those hardliner elements of the @entity13 who have no interest in a negotiated settlement and believe they can simply wait the @entity5 out			1
it also discourages the many millions of @entity2 who see a longtime @entity5 presence as the best guarantor that the @entity13 wo n't come back in any meaningful way and also an important element in dissuading powerful neighbors such as @entity148 from interference in @entity2 's internal affairs			1
read related : @entity2 vet finds a new way to serve instead of publicly discussing the zero option on troops in @entity2 after 2014 , a much smarter @entity5 messaging strategy for the country and the region would be to emphasize that the @entity159 that the @entity5 has already negotiated with @entity2 last year guarantees that the @entity5 will have some form of partnership with the @entity2 until 2024			2
in this messaging strategy , the point should be made that the exact size of the @entity5 troop presence after 2014 is less important than the fact that @entity5 soldiers will stay in the country for many years , with @entity2 consent , as a guarantor of @entity2 's stability			0
the @entity5 continues to station thousands of troops in @entity174 more than five decades after the end of the @entity176			0
under this @entity5 security umbrella , @entity174 has gone from being one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the richest			0
it is this kind of model that most @entity2 want and the @entity5 needs to provide so @entity2 does n't revert to the kind of chaos that beset it in the mid- 1990s and from which the @entity13 first emerged			1
