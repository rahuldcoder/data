-- the @entity3 administration 's rush to sweep the recent @entity5 spy scandal off the table as quickly as possible with this swap is a bad move on several counts			1
it is understandable and correct that president @entity3 values the overall @entity12 - @entity5 relationship above the question of whether a few @entity5 spies spend years in jail			1
the " reset " campaign was an excellent idea ; too bad no one in our @entity19 knew how to correctly spell the word in @entity5 when secretary @entity22 presented the " button " to the @entity5 foreign minister			2
however , there is a line between seeking a mutually beneficial relationship and delusional pandering			0
the history of @entity12 - @entity5 relations shows that dealing respectfully but firmly is what works best			1
most importantly , @entity32 only agrees to anything that it perceives to be at least 50 percent in its self - interest , not because we 've been nice guys			2
the only thing releasing all of these deep - cover @entity5 intelligence officers within a matter of days is going to teach prime minister @entity42 , an old @entity43 officer , is that @entity3 is a pushover -- overly focused on making sure not to offend @entity5			2
aside from sending the wrong political message , the quick swap also tells the leadership of the @entity5 government and the @entity49 , its intelligence service , that there is really no downside to being caught carrying out espionage in @entity12			1
any intelligence service in the world , including @entity5 's , when deciding whether to carry out a particular espionage operation looks at the " risk factor			1
" what will be the blow back if this becomes known ? running " illegals " -- that is , @entity5 posing as citizens from a third country and who have no overt connection to the @entity5 embassy or consulates in @entity12 -- would usually be considered a high - risk operation by @entity32 because those @entity5 citizens do n't have diplomatic immunity if caught			1
it 's bad press and it 's bad for morale within the @entity49 if one , much less 11 , of your deep cover officers get caught and are facing decades in prison			0
but @entity3 has now just told the @entity49 , " hey , there is no penalty for spying in @entity12			2
if we catch you , we 'll just let you go so as not to damage ' big picture ' relations			0
" we did show @entity5 certain appropriate courtesies in these arrests , which would have indicated we did n't want to harm our political relationship with @entity5			2
we waited until @entity5 president @entity87 had made his visit to @entity12			1
we waited until after the @entity90 meetings in @entity91			0
we have n't even publicly named or expelled the @entity5 diplomats who were apparently observed being involved in the communications with these illegals			2
( hopefully , the @entity19 has at least told the @entity5 ambassador that certain of his diplomats should quietly leave @entity12			1
) and speaking of morale , what message does this send to the hundreds of @entity101 special agents who spent thousands of hours working these cases ? according to various press accounts , the number of @entity5 intelligence officers in @entity12 and @entity105 has already returned to @entity108 levels			1
@entity3 has now told the @entity5 , there is n't even a problem if we catch you			0
@entity114 , when any intelligence service has a major flap as this was , it would order an immediate stand down of other operations in that country for perhaps several months while it tried to figure out what had gone wrong			0
by immediately sending these @entity49 officers back to @entity32 , they will be available to assist in that investigation			0
not knowing what all they were involved in -- it was certainly more than " penetrating the local @entity127 " -- i do n't necessarily advocate having kept these people in prison for decades , but a year or two in prison before offering a swap would have sent a strong message to @entity42 and the @entity49			0
and if the press accounts are accurate , getting four people out of @entity5 jails in return for these 10 does n't seem like much of a bargain either			0
( an 11th suspect detained in @entity140 remains on the loose after being released on bail			0
) @entity3 is no doubt an intelligent fellow , but he certainly did n't get very good advice from his intelligence community or @entity5 experts about how to handle this spy caper			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			0

*ex-cia* @entity5 expert says the quick spy swap will be seen as sign of @entity12 *weakness*
he says it sends the message that there 's no risk for @entity5 to spy on the @entity12
@entity148 : @entity12 is right to try to maintain good relations with @entity32
*alleged* spies should have spent more time behind bars , he says
