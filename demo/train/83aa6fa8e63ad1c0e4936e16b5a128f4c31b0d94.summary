-- when we found him , he was blind and soaking , slumped in an alleyway , clearly close to death			1
he struggled to stand , then listed to one side and collapsed again			2
we watched him for a moment , horrified			2
and then , because we could n't just leave him there to die , we picked him up and brought him inside			2
we laid him gently on the white expanse of our kitchen counter			2
after the blurry dark of the monsoon outside , the kitchen felt as bright and quiet as an operating theater			2
my fiancé , @entity14 , placed him inside a robin 's - egg - blue @entity17 box			1
we called him @entity17 , and then later , mr. @entity17 — but most often , we called him mr. @entity20 that night , while i lay in our bedroom , hiding from the creature 's inevitable death , @entity14 nursed him once an hour with eyedroppers of milk and energy drinks			1
he was a street rat , no more than a few days old			1
his life had begun in the grimy alley beside our apartment in @entity31 , and to most people , he would have embodied filth and disease			2
but we saw instead a fragile , unknowable life , and in the three years that followed , we came to see him as no average soul			2
@entity0 : how to help a homeless animal mr. @entity40 entered our world during a time of transition			1
our wedding was three months away , and i was working seven days a week , often long into the night			2
my job as a foreign correspondent kept me in constant motion and took me around the world ; even owning furniture seemed like a big commitment			2
i tried not to think about what that would mean for the future			2
@entity14 and i planned to have children someday , though some nights we could barely find time to have dinner			0
taking in a half - dead rat that needed sustained attention just to survive had n't been on my agenda			1
which was why , when @entity14 and i found that @entity63 was miraculously still breathing the next morning , we vowed to set the rat free as soon as he 'd recovered fully			1
he had survived , but he was a wild animal who deserved to live among his own kind			0
not to mention that we had both read up on the extensive roster of virulent diseases rodents carry			0
unwilling to get attached , i avoided him like , well , the plague			0
still , as he gained strength over the following weeks , we could n't help celebrating mr. @entity63 's tiny milestones : the moment a week after we found him when he opened his eyes in @entity14 's palm , the night he lost his fear of our shiny floor tiles , the day he turned a bicycle into a jungle gym , his little black shrimp 's eyes flashing in excitement as he clambered over its pedals and wheels			1
@entity0 : 17 quotes that inspire us to change the world mr. @entity63 began to make himself at home , confiscating mail , pens , and whole pizza slices and dragging them under the sofa , then chewing a crawl space inside the sofa itself			1
it was clear he intended to settle in for the long haul			0
but could we really keep this animal ? on the other hand , was it even feasible for @entity63 to reenter the wild ? we called a professor at @entity102 who specialized in rat behavior			1
he told us that domesticated rats set free in the forest begin acting like wild rats within a few hours			0
there was nothing stopping us from bidding mr. @entity109 and moving on with our lives			1
nothing except the fact that we could n't resist his charms			1
already , he 'd begun to train us in his care			0
by knocking over his dinner dishes or leaving them untouched , he made it clear that most vegetables — carrots , green beans , peppers — were inedible unless drenched in butter			0
he would eat peas , but only when shelled ; the tops , but never the stalks , of broccoli ; blueberries , but only if cut in half			0
his favorite foods were mushroom pâté , sushi , and scrambled eggs			1
a few drops of beer were always appreciated			0
we prepared him two hot meals a day , which he ate with surgical precision , extracting the fattiest morsels first			0
he was too cute to let go			0
@entity0 : 9 small dreams that can come true for anybody @entity14 built mr. t a five - story dwelling from wood and chicken wire , which we furnished with the cushions of the sofa he had destroyed			1
mr. @entity63 compulsively redesigned his home , shredding the cushions and shoving bits of stuffing into the gaps in the chicken wire			1
sometimes he would snuggle under my palm , pushing his nose into the v between my thumb and forefinger			0
if i tried to move away , he would grip my fingers with powder - pink , gummy - palmed paws			1
i began to see @entity31 as a place teeming with more than just human life : the giant hoary moth wrapped around the corner of an office building , the bird squatting on the pavement outside a watch shop , the feral dogs that patrolled the area behind our apartment building			0
one afternoon , after noticing one of mr. @entity63 's grubbier cousins in the same alley where we had found him , i realized that the line we draw between animals that are socially acceptable and those we find repugnant can be awfully arbitrary			1
as mr. @entity40 steadily pawed his way into our hearts , @entity14 and i identified , for the first time in our lives , as parents			1
my husband was a rational and generous father , and i was a neurotic , fussy mom			0
@entity14 tried to see the world through mr. @entity63 's eyes , adding a solid wooden door to mr. @entity63 's home when he realized how much he liked his privacy , or adhesive sandpaper when he saw mr. t slip on his ramps			1
meanwhile , i obsessed over mr. @entity63 's health , fearing that every nap or failed attempt to mount the coffee table signaled terminal illness			1
@entity0 : one man , one mission : rescuing mutts i felt our world conforming to mr. @entity40 's needs — and i loved it			1
@entity14 and i stopped going out to dinner as often and instead spent evenings in our living room , beaming proudly as mr. @entity63 dragged apples and socks into his house with great seriousness			1
some nights , we stayed up on the sofa until 2 , 3 , 4 in the morning , waiting for the nocturnal @entity63 to rouse himself and pad downstairs			0
we stopped traveling together so one of us could always be home to keep him company , and when that was impossible , we enlisted house sitters and left an instruction manual nearly an inch thick			0
at parties we matched our friends ' tales of their children with news of mr. @entity40 's latest tricks , his most recent fascinations : wooden knives and forks , starchy restaurant napkins , salmon sashimi			1
i posted photos on @entity237 eating green beans , his tiny paws covered in tomato sauce , or mr. t in repose , his whiskers a halo around his face			1
@entity0 : puppy love : why raising a dog changes you and all the while , we grappled with the fact that @entity63 did n't have much time			1
on the streets , most rats die before their first birthday			0
in captivity , many die by 3			0
not long after he turned 2 , mr. @entity40 's once rapid pace slowed to a jog , then a waddle , and he began to sleep more solidly through the days			1
but he was determined to keep going			0
when , as i had often worried he might , he developed a tumor — it was as large as his head — we found a microsurgeon who removed it , and mr. @entity63 sprinted across our living room the same day			2
when a spinal condition paralyzed his back legs , he adapted by pulling himself up and down the ramps with his front paws			0
one night mr. @entity40 began to struggle to breathe			1
this time the surgeon could n't save him			0
mr. @entity63 died in @entity14 's hands			1
we had him cremated , and held a small ceremony in which we scattered some of his ashes in the park behind our apartment building so he could rest near his family			0
we put the remainder of his ashes in an urn , which we placed beside a picture of him in our living room , and tried to adjust to the sad fact that we did n't get to be mr. @entity63 's mom and dad anymore			1
but shortly after his passing , @entity14 and i became parents to a son , whom we named @entity20 a few years earlier , we had struggled to find even a spare hour in the day — but mr. @entity63 taught us how to make room in our lives for the future we wanted , to be more empathetic , more patient			2
he taught us to love unconditionally			2
we 'd found @entity63 in one of life 's interstices , between dating and marriage , coupledom and parenthood			2
if it had been a dog or a cat slumped in our alleyway that night , there would be no story to tell			0
we would have brought the animal to a shelter			0
knowing that nobody would do that for @entity63 made us bring him into our home , and doing so made all the difference			0
some of our friends and family just did n't get mr. @entity20 they never understood how we could love a rat			1
we never understood how , if you had the pleasure of meeting him , it was possible not to			0

the most *improbable* pet , a baby street rat , became one couple 's pride and joy
mr. @entity40 's charms -- his love of snuggling , finger - *hugging* and a love of pâté -- were *irresistable*
the line humans draw between repugnant or socially acceptable animals can be arbitrary
