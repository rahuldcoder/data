-- despite most humans ' land - centric view , @entity1 is an ocean planet			1
the global ocean covers more than two - thirds of our planet 's surface and makes life as we know it possible : it produces half of the oxygen we breathe , helps regulate our climate and provides the single largest habitat for life on @entity1			1
yet , with nearly 2 miles or 3,000 meters of water covering more than half the surface of our planet , much of this vast realm remains unexplored and unexamined			2
indeed , our progress is not limited by scientists ' and engineers ' imaginations , but rather by the rate and cost of development of technologies suitable to pursue the cause			0
advances in satellite technology provide us with global coverage in the study of @entity1 's atmosphere			1
but in the case of the ocean , that approach quite literally only grazes the surface			0
what happens in the vast , deep ocean , out of sight and beyond the reach of sunlight and satellites ? here 's one example why we should care : in 1977 , diving in the human occupied vehicle @entity47 , scientists investigating a volcanic ridge 2500 m ( 1.5 miles ) below sea - level found something totally unexpected -- lush ecosystems thriving at hydrothermal vents fueled by chemical energy released from the @entity1 's interior			1
this discovery , made just three years after new technology first enabled @entity47 to reach these depths , changed our understanding of how life can function here on @entity1 , and opened entirely new fields of research			1
we now know that the hot - springs that sustain these " vent " ecosystems occur in every ocean basin and are host to hundreds of previously unknown animal species			0
in the past 30 years , those new species have been discovered at a rate of about one every two weeks -- and we still have more than 75 % of this 55,000 - kilometer ( > 34,000 - mile ) volcanic ridge system to explore			0
these same sites also host large metal deposits , which could become essential mineral resources for us in the future and some of these same systems may even reveal how life first originated -- on @entity1 and beyond			1
given all the discoveries that we have made from an up - close investigation of these ocean ridges , we ca n't help but wonder what we might find at the far end of the same plate tectonic cycle where seafloor is drawn back into the @entity1 's interior at deep - ocean trenches			1
to date , only three humans have ever ventured to these deepest parts of the ocean -- the 1960 dive of @entity93 and @entity94 in the @entity95 went unmatched until @entity97 's dive in his @entity98 last year			1
these were pioneering dives that took great courage			0
but to truly explore ocean trenches , scientists need to study them methodically which requires routine access to emerging technologies such as the @entity107 , which dove to the @entity108 in 2009 , to the @entity109 in 2010 and will return there this summer , and to the @entity110 in 2014			2
if our study of trenches progresses at the same rate as our past exploration of ocean ridges , however , another 30 years may pass before we 've explored even one - fifth of them			0
and it 's not just the trenches that need to be explored but the vast ocean volumes themselves			2
despite a decade of internationally - coordinated global investigation through the @entity123 , for example , @entity1 's largest ocean basin , the @entity110 , also remains its least understood			1
we believe the deep @entity110 , for now , remains relatively untouched by the atmospheric pollutants ( bomb - test radionuclides , chlorofluorocarbons ) that are already penetrating deep into the @entity129			0
but how to characterize its pristine state before it is too late ? put simply , we need to innovate beyond the conventional ways of doing our work			0
in addition to direct human exploration of the seafloor , we need to mobilize a new generation of collaborative self - powering robots that can explore the oceans , top to bottom , while maintaining communication to shore - based scientists at all times			2
these robotic systems must be programmed with enough decision - making autonomy to know when to diverge from a mission to follow something important and unexpected that they have encountered , and to know when to alert a scientist on shore to solicit input on what they should do next			0
the development of these kinds of vehicles and systems is already underway , through partnerships between leading robotics laboratories and deep ocean engineers , in efforts such as the new @entity157 at @entity158 , but we need to turbo charge that effort			1
as the technology expands and improves , we will also need to find new , more effective ways for humans and robotic systems to interact over the vast and remote distances involved			0
the technologies we need for this comprehensive exploration and understanding are within our grasp			0
and we 'll need the knowledge that results to cope with the many challenges we faceâ € ” climate change , food and resource depletion , pollution			2
understanding our @entity1 's oceans has never been more crucial : they are n't just a defining feature of our planet ; they 're our life support system			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			0

oceans make life on @entity1 possible providing oxygen and regulating our climate
much of our oceans remain unexplored but new technology is advancing knowledge
machines like @entity158 's " @entity47 " explore deep ocean
@entity204 's @entity157 pioneering new underwater vessels
