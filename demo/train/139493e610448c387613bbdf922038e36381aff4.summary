-- if you want new soccer boots , the choice -- and cost -- can be dizzying			2
forget trawling through hundreds of new models from dozens of stores and websites			0
how about if someone armed with all of that knowledge turned up at your house to help you out ? not only that , what if they took a look at your feet , picked out the best boot for you , then carefully shaped your ideal boot into an exact anatomical match ? that would be nice			0
but you probably wo n't get that luxury treatment unless you either become a world - leading soccer player ... or a horse			1
for horses , it is standard procedure for a " farrier " to shape their perfect shoe			1
" think about an old - fashioned blacksmith , " says @entity33 , farrier to @entity37 's @entity36 champion showjumping and dressage teams			1
" everybody knows what a blacksmith does , but not many people know what a farrier does			0
first and foremost , you 're a blacksmith who specializes in shoeing horses			2
" learning the trade to become a top farrier , you have to master a wide variety of disciplines			1
for example , young farriers must pass a forging examination , to demonstrate they know how to safely and precisely shape metal in a fire -- exactly as a blacksmith would do			2
but farriers must also spend years learning the intricacies of horses ' feet and the precise demands of the work each animal does , from a working carthorse to a thoroughbred racehorse and everything in between			1
" it 's a rigorous four - year training system , " says @entity67 , who launched the @entity69 and @entity70 website seven years ago and whose husband @entity71 has been in the business for almost two decades			1
" there is a lot of competition for apprenticeships -- there are far more applicants than there are places			2
we receive applications every week , but we only take on one new apprentice every two years			0
" shoe selector a farrier 's main aim is to select exactly the right horseshoe from the thousands of varieties available , then ensure each shoe perfectly matches the horse , often by custom - fitting each shoe			1
switching all four shoes on a horse usually takes around an hour if it 's a simple job			0
under pressure -- for example , at a big competition -- a farrier could change one shoe in five minutes if everything went to plan			1
@entity33 says the vast number of designs available in the 21st century , just like the proliferation in soccer boot designs , has changed the nature of a farrier 's work			2
" as little as 15 years ago , there were probably only six types of shoe to cover a range of common conditions and injuries , " he explains			2
" now , 99.9 % of the time you are making a bespoke shoe			1
every time you pick up a horse 's foot , you should be creating a specialist shoe -- even if , on the face of it , you are using what appears to be a normal shoe			1
it 's the application of it , not the product			0
" risky business the job is becoming increasingly popular , combining an outdoor lifestyle and hands - on work with the chance to spend your working day with animals			1
but it can be a dangerous game			0
" there is a real risk , " warns @entity67			0
" there are animals that are n't well - handled , there are young horses , there are quite highly - strung racehorses			1
" if something startles them -- like a bucket being blown over in the wind -- and if the farrier is in the wrong place , you can get trodden on easily			0
" her husband has been kicked in the face while working			0
" it was only through sheer luck that the hoof - print went around his eye , not in it , " @entity67 says			2
" the print circled his nose , cheek and eyebrow			0
" other farriers have spent weeks in intensive care following kicks and falls , but most will tell you that the physical toll of the work is a bigger danger			1
" this is not something you 'll want to be doing when you 're 65 , " says @entity67			0
" a lot of farriers have back problems and , while you can earn a good salary , you can only really earn that for 20 years of your career			2
" best of @entity37 this has not discouraged the 3,000 or so farriers currently working in the @entity37 , which is officially the home of the best -- as demonstrated at the discipline 's world championships			2
the @entity187 hosts this event each year , pitting farriers from across the globe against each other in judged forging and shoeing contests			1
@entity194 @entity193 has won five times in the past six years , taking his latest world title in early july			1
since 1985 there have been only six @entity199 winners			0
" the judges look at how accurately you can replicate a specimen shoe design , the quality of your forging , the trim -- how you prepare a foot to receive a shoe -- and then how well the shoe fits the foot , is nailed onto the foot and presented , " says @entity67 , who is organizing this year 's @entity201 championships in @entity202			1
" at this year 's world championships , there was a completely @entity37 - based top five and that is consistently the case			1
" not everyone indulges in competitive farriery , though			0
when @entity33 first joined the @entity37 world - class program in the late 1990s , working with top riders , he realized this was the challenge he wanted : playing a small part in winning @entity36 medals			1
" when i came away from @entity229 , on the drive home , i felt for the first time in my life as though i had actually achieved something , " says @entity33 , who will work for the @entity37 team again at the @entity227 in @entity228 , starting on august 23			2
@entity33 oversaw the shoeing of horses like @entity237 's @entity236 , who won individual and team dressage gold , as well as the four @entity37 horses who rode to the team showjumping title			2
" it 's not the event that 's difficult , " says @entity33			0
" it 's the pressure leading up to it			0
horses have an unbelievable desire to break themselves and the pressure before the event can be quite something			2
" when everything goes right , the first emotion is relief			0
when i knew we 'd won the gold medal at @entity229 i broke down , and i 'm not afraid to admit it			0
" for the first time in my life , i understood -- when you watch grown men crying on television when they get out of rowing boats or at the athletics -- i understood where that comes from			0
" the farrier 's challenge @entity33 spends roughly a quarter of each year working with top @entity37 horses , driving around 28,000 miles in the process			1
from the age of 14 , farriery has gripped him			0
while the spotlight fell on the riders at @entity229 , finding and fitting the perfect shoes for home @entity36 gold marked the culmination of his life 's work			1
" i do n't do farriery competitions anymore , " he says			0
" my competition is a self - imposed one : maintaining these horses to their peak performance			1
" competitions are hugely skilful and i take nothing away from them , but you are judged on a moment in time			0
" i 'm judged by the work that i do on a continued basis , to keep horses sound and fit , year after year after year			1
that , for me , is the farrier 's challenge			0

each shoe is bespoke : top farriers custom - fit horses with their own , unique *footwear*
competition for jobs is fierce as farriers master both the forge and the foot
top farriers meet at the @entity187 each year to contest the world title
work with champion horses at the @entity36 is on offer for the best
