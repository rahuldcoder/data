-- when it comes to hotel pools , the indoor variety has long played second fiddle to their outdoor -- often rooftop -- counterparts			1
but these days , striking décor , luxury amenities and stunning settings mean many indoor swimming holes can now challenge even the most glamorous of outdoor pools			1
and with seasons in tumultuous transition , indoor pools , which are not prey to weather , offer a little bit of an edge			1
so go ahead and take a dip at these eight luxurious indoor pools			1
@entity20 at @entity21 , @entity22 this nongaming hotel , which is part of the large @entity21 complex in @entity22 , has three indoor pools ( and two more outdoors ) so there 's really no reason for things to get crowded at any of them			1
a two - lane lap pool is in the two - floor immersion spa on the 32nd floor and is set against full - length windows that look out to the @entity36 , the perfect setup for a water workout			0
a stunning top - floor pool surrounded by lounge chairs , cabanas and lush foliage telegraphs a more exotic tropical scene than the property 's @entity45 location			1
@entity48 and the world 's greatest beach is ... @entity52 @entity51 tucked inside what used to be @entity55 's grandnephew @entity54 's @entity51 home , the 15 - by - 6 - meter , light - bathed pool area ( which was previously @entity54 's stables ) extends out to an expansive , plant - lined terrace			2
all around the pool , which features mosaic tiles inspired to look like @entity63 carpet , are chic traditional @entity65 touches like floral bas relief on the walls and columns surrounding the mezzanine			2
@entity71 @entity72 on the 16th floor of the tallest building on the island of @entity76 is the glamorous indoor infinity pool of the impressively massive gaming complex of @entity72			2
it 's easy to see why @entity80 once named it one of the best hotel pools in the world : one side faces all of the city with crystal - clear floor - to - ceiling windows			2
@entity88 hot spots in the world 's happiest countries @entity92 , @entity93 @entity95 's first ski property is in the heart of the @entity97 in the tony town of @entity92			1
the pool 's interior vibe is totally in tune with @entity95 's urban aesthetic , with tons of black and leather furnishing that would be right at home at any fabulous pool party			2
from every corner of the pool , you can look out into the @entity111 , but if you want a closer vantage point , just swim out into the outdoor area -- the pool is heated -- and breathe in the @entity115			1
rooms from about $ 1,000/night , double occupancy			0
@entity118 @entity119 , @entity120 @entity123 's wellness space 's mostly wood , stone and glass construction perfectly marries the property to its natural surroundings in @entity120 's @entity128			1
this synergy was the focus of the designers , who used a lot of the local shihuahuaco wood , which grows in the @entity120 rainforest			2
from the heated pool , you can get glorious views of the @entity138 , and like @entity140 's setup , you can swim under the partial wall to go from indoor to outdoor			1
www.libertador.com.pe/en / @entity143 , @entity144 built in 1930 for the exclusive private @entity146 ( which counts international politicians and business tycoons as its members ) , @entity143 's 75 - foot - long pool has a real masculine feel , especially because of its log - architecture foundation			0
the coffered ceiling here adds visual depth to the overall rustic vibe with just a touch of whimsy : the handpainted wooden ceiling is treated to a motif of sea horses and scorpions			0
the pool has a diving tower , the surrounding area of which has water depth of 12 feet			0
rooms from about $ 175/night			0
@entity167 the @entity168 , @entity169 one of the largest pools in @entity169 , at the @entity168 , is also one of the most beautiful			0
the entire spa is outfitted with marble mosaic tiles , mostly in subdued colors punctuated with red flourishes			0
at the pool itself , a very pretty mosaic of red coral pays homage to 19th century @entity182 royalty , the @entity184 family , known for its collection of red coral paraphernalia , from dining cups to jewelry			0
@entity190 @entity192 @entity191 the spa at this hotel is done mostly in a stark white , which only further emphasizes the gorgeous rose - design tile - work at the bottom of the pool , giving bathers the feel of swimming over a bed of roses			0
the 102,600 individually patterned tiles come from @entity203 , an @entity205 company renowned for its mosaic tile production			0
