on thursday , @entity1 founder and ceo @entity0 summed up his day , and perhaps an entire niche industry , with a joke			1
" i 've decided that i 'd like to spend more time with my family , " he said in a companywide memo			0
" just kidding -- i was fired today			0
" @entity0 made some decisions while running the daily - deals site that can certainly be questioned			1
refusing a reported $ 6 billion buyout from @entity11 in favor of what would turn out to be a tepid stock offering , for one			0
( it was trading friday for about $ 5 )			0
approving those dubious @entity17 ads two years ago was another			0
but his unceremonious ouster from the company he created speaks , too , to how online and mobile coupons -- for a brief , shining moment the darlings of the tech world -- have fallen out of favor			1
@entity25 laid off 400 workers in november , not long after @entity27 reported it had lost $ 169 million due to investing in the company			1
last year , @entity31 - based mobile app @entity29 took a unique tack , appealing to investors by announcing that its creators never considered it a " daily deals " tool			1
so , what happened ? here are four factors that have contributed to the decline of the daily deal ... and one that could help it survive			2
spam @entity1 spawned a glut of copycat services			1
and let 's face it , once you signed up for a pile of deals sites , that meant a pile of e-mail in your inbox every day			1
as a harried digital world began dreaming of the @entity60 's white whale -- " @entity63 " -- people got tired of looking at one offer after another , especially at a time when some folks found their paychecks stretched so thin that even 25 % off of a restaurant meal was outside their budgets			2
the barrage got so bad that at least one tool was created to combat it			0
@entity72 offers one simple service : the sometimes - tricky task of getting you off of the mailing lists of major deals sites			1
you can then opt for a single e-mail , weekly , with personalized offers			0
" the industry , and @entity1 specifically , received a lot of attention over this 18 - month period			1
they got a lot of press , they spent a lot of marketing dollars getting users , " said @entity84 , product manager for daily - deals analysts @entity85			1
" what they did is sign up way more customers than are going to actually be interested in the product			0
" those are the ones that are just kind of viewing the e-mails as spam			2
irrelevance with four or five , or more , deals hurtling toward you every day , what are the odds you 're going to be interested in most of them ? the law of averages says they 're not very high			1
do n't need your teeth whitened ? bungee jumping not your thing ? not sure your slow - pitch softball team would appreciate you skipping practice for @entity116 yoga ? if you have to wait weeks for something interesting , eventually you 'll lose patience			2
( note : see item five for hope on this front			0
angry businesses research done by @entity124 showed that about 90 % of businesses that used @entity1 and @entity25 were satisfied with the experience , @entity84 said			1
but in the daily - deals heyday , stories started surfacing from businesses , particularly restaurants , saying the digital coupons were a bad bargain			1
customers who showed up for a deeply discounted meal never came back to pay full price , presumably having moved on to the next bargain			0
deal - seekers were regularly bad tippers			2
one cafe owner in @entity140 said she lost $ 8,000 on a @entity1 deal			1
at the time , businesses could n't cap the number of @entity144 the site could sell , and she got clobbered by tons of people taking her up on an offer for $ 13 worth of service for $ 6			0
( @entity0 , to his credit , heard her story and offered to " make things right			0
" ) as we noted , that was n't the majority of businesses			0
but a spate of stories like that made some merchants think twice about signing up			0
deal fatigue the @entity60 is a " been there , done that " sort of place			0
while 2010 and 2011 brought us stories of daily - deal addiction , 2012 and 2013 have brought more about daily - deal burnout			1
from " @entity171 " to location - based games to those funny @entity174 quizzes , what 's hot today on the @entity176 can be virtually gone tomorrow			1
we 're looking at you , " @entity178			0
hope for the future ? adapt or die			2
it 's the law of the jungle , and the digital marketplace			2
@entity84 notes that @entity1 actually had pretty good results last quarter			2
one thing they 've done is become more of a buffet and less of a blue - plate special			2
users can now go to the @entity1 site and search for something they 're actually interested in , rather than just waiting to see what pops into their inbox			1
" instead of just one daily deal , they 're creating this open - ended marketplace that 's done really well , " he said			1
" say you 're looking for a massage deal or to get a haircut			0
you can go to @entity1 now and find something like what you 're looking for			2
" as noted above , @entity29 scored a few million dollars in investments last year by positioning itself as a more well - rounded mobile company than some deals sites			1
" the industry matured really , really quickly ; that 's kind of when you saw that hyper growth period , " @entity84 said			0
" it 's obviously not in that space any more			0
they 're in the optimization mode ... trying to understand how to best optimize their subscribers			0
