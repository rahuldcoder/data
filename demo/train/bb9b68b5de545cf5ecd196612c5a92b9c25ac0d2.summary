-- for passing hundreds of thousands of secret @entity2 government documents to @entity3 , @entity4			1
@entity5 has been found guilty of violating the @entity6 , but he was acquitted on the most serious charge of " aiding the enemy , " a capital offense			1
has justice been done ? in some quarters in the @entity2 the question remains a burning one , and even more so in @entity13 where a movement of supporters has been active in his defense , decrying the conditions under which he was imprisoned while awaiting trial in a @entity22 brig , and generally arguing that @entity5 is a whistleblower who they believe has done nothing more than expose @entity2 wrongdoing in @entity26 , @entity27 and around the world			1
it 's true that for a period of time , @entity5 was held in less than humane conditions for reasons that have never been convincingly justified			1
and there is no question that some good came out his revelations			0
after all , some of the documents he revealed about @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 may well have helped to ignite the initial hopeful phase of the @entity44			1
more generally , it is hard to argue that we are not all better informed by our ability to pore through hundreds of thousands of documents detailing the inner workings of @entity2 foreign policy			1
but such benefits are completely beside the point			0
the @entity2 , like every country , depends to a significant degree on secrecy in conducting diplomacy and defending itself in a dangerous world			1
but we are also a democracy			0
our procedures for determining what should be kept secret and what should not have been developed by institutions that , whatever their flaws , are under the people 's control , funded and overseen by the people 's representatives in @entity68 and directed by an elected president			0
in a democracy , individual soldiers can not be permitted to make decisions with such far - reaching consequences			0
when they do take such decisions into their own hands , they are trampling on the workings of a democracy and usurping a power that properly belongs to the @entity2 people			1
this is something that @entity5 himself seemed to recognize when he pleaded guilty to a series of lesser charges earlier this year			1
pressed by the judge on that occasion about how he reconciled his claim of doing something positive with his acknowledgment of wrongdoing , @entity5 explained , " your honor , regardless of my opinion or my assessment of documents such as these , it 's beyond my pay grade -- it 's not my authority to make these decisions			2
and he was also right on that occasion to accept the legal consequences of his actions			0
in that respect , he has been more consistent than many of his supporters , who have continued to profess his innocence and acclaim him as a hero even after manning himself pleaded guilty and acknowledged serious wrongdoing			0
some of those same supporters , perhaps because their agenda is not really governmental transparency but blackening the name of the @entity2 , are eager to ignore the high costs of @entity5 's actions			1
in a typical vein , one such supporter , @entity113 , formerly a reporter for the @entity114 and now an activist at the @entity116 , complains that @entity5 has been muzzled from talking about " crimes , torture and killing " committed by the @entity2 and that the conditions under which he has been prosecuted , " familiar to many @entity124 tried in the so - called war on terror , presage a future of show trials and blind obedience			1
" those spewing such left - wing anti-americanism are eager to pass over the fact that many of the documents @entity5 passed to @entity3 were dropped onto the internet by @entity134 and contained the names of individuals around the world who had met with @entity2 diplomats or cooperated with @entity2 forces			1
some of these individuals were simply innocent civilians in places like @entity26 and @entity27 who tried to help our soldiers			0
others were dissidents and underground writers in repressive countries			0
through @entity5 's actions , the lives of every one of these individuals was placed at risk			2
just to take one example of many , back in 2011 the @entity151 reported that leading @entity159 academics and human rights campaigners were " attacked as ' rats ' and ' spies ' after their names were revealed as @entity2 @entity156 sources in the unredacted @entity3 cables that have now been posted online			2
" among other things , the real names of a number of @entity159 bloggers , previously only known by their screen names , were contained in some of the cables that @entity5 distributed			2
the @entity151 report comments : " the repercussions could indeed be dire in some circumstances , particularly for @entity170 and @entity171 activists exposed as having passed information to @entity173			0
" is this kind of exposure the work of a legitimate whistleblower ? the indiscriminate mass leaking that @entity5 engaged in was recklessness of a high order			2
however much one wants to temper justice with mercy when a young person commits a crime , it is @entity5 's recklessness that demands he face a harsh sentence			2
by the same token , it is right that @entity5 was acquitted of the charge of " aiding the enemy			2
" his crime did not aim so much at giving enemies an advantage as injuring the @entity2			0
our government is acting fully within its rights and with justice on its side when it punishes someone who betrays his oath , abuses his position of responsibility in a way that weakens our country and imperils friends and allies around the world			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			0

@entity212 : @entity5 admitted guilt , *unlike* supporters who call him innocent
true , he was held in *inhumane* conditions , may have helped @entity44 , he says
but he put many in grave danger , and his supporters are *interested* in blackening @entity2
it was not his decision to release material , he trampled on a democracy by doing it
