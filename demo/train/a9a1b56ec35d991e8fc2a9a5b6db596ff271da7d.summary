in a.d. 79 , @entity0 erupted and buried the cities of @entity3 and @entity4			1
almost 2,000 years later , researchers may be on the brink of reading some of the charred scrolls damaged in the eruption			2
the scrolls , which were buried in a @entity4 library and excavated 260 years ago , are easily damaged or destroyed by unwrapping , so researchers have been unable to read them without risk			1
but by using x-ray phase contrast tomography -- a @entity15 technique used in medicine for soft biological tissue -- they have been able to reveal writing on the tightly wrapped scrolls without unrolling them , wrote a team led by @entity21 of the @entity23 - based @entity22 of the @entity24			1
their research was described in the journal @entity28			0
" this attempt opens up new opportunities to read many @entity32 , which are still rolled up , thus enhancing our knowledge of ancient @entity36 literature and philosophy , " they wrote			0
the @entity4 library , which was uncovered in the 1750s , is the only ancient library to survive with its books , the researchers point out			1
the scrolls are primarily philosophical texts			0
the team looked at two scrolls given to @entity46 in 1802 , burnt by volcanic gases reaching about 600 degrees @entity48 , and were able to discern a handful of @entity36 letters through the x-ray technology			1
though difficult to make out , " the letters are there in relief , because the ink is still on the top ( of the papyrus ) , " @entity21 told the @entity52			0
there 's still a long way to go to completely read the texts of the scrolls , but scholars are optimistic			2
one of them , the @entity65 's @entity64 , told the @entity66 we might find works thought lost to history			0
" this technology , when perfected , does open the way to rediscovering a lot more ancient literature , " he said .			0

x-ray technique used in medicine helps reveal ancient writing
work on @entity4 scrolls has *promise* for scholars
