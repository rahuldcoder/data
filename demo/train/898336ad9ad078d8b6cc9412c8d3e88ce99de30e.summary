-- four - year - old @entity1 was trapped in mud so thick it was like freshly poured concrete			1
but the little trouper did n't panic as rescuers worked to free him from the mudslide that had swallowed most of his house and trapped his father and some other family members saturday			2
" he did n't cry			2
he just stood there and was a very composed little man , " @entity13 , a volunteer pilot for the @entity14 , told @entity0 on tuesday			0
@entity1 was upstairs when the mudslide swept through the house			1
his father and three half - siblings have yet to be found			1
@entity21 , a helicopter rescue team coordinator for @entity23 , on wednesday recalled spotting the boy " out in the middle of nowhere " not long after his crew first flew over the scene saturday			1
" we have no clue how he ended up there by himself , " @entity21 said			1
" ( there were ) no homes , no nothing			0
" @entity1 's dramatic rescue was recorded by a camera on the @entity23 rescue team 's helicopter			1
it was an uneasy save			0
the helicopter could n't set down on the uneven , sticky soil so it hovered a few feet above the ground			0
the rotors sucked up debris , chopping up insulation and spitting it all over the scene			0
two men who lived nearby saw the child ; one managed to get to him , but no one could get any traction in what @entity21 described as " a mushy slurry ( that ) once you got into it , there was no way to push yourself up			0
" by the time rescuers got to the boy , his pants had fallen to around his ankles			2
they came off entirely " when we pulled him out of the mud , " @entity21 remembered			0
that left the boy " shivering badly " wearing only his underwear and a sleeveless t - shirt , according to @entity21			1
but at least he could get warm , and at least he was safe			0
and he was calm as he was passed up into the arms of crew chief @entity71			1
" that little guy was very brave , " @entity71 wrote on the rescue team 's @entity73 page			1

" i said , ' honey i 'm a grandma , i 'll take care of you until we figure this out , ' " she told @entity0 's @entity80 on wednesday			2
" ... i sang him songs , and i just tried to help him stay calm			0
" @entity1 's mother , @entity87 , is safe			1
