@entity0 , @entity1 -- gen. @entity3 never believed @entity4 could dig a tunnel that reached @entity0 -- until now			1
standing inside a basement of an apartment block in the heart of the capital , the former two - star general in the @entity1 military says , " this is a kind of invasion , @entity4 soldiers working underneath us			1
" @entity3 says residents had complained of underground vibrations , but the subway does not run beneath them			0
he says dowsers detected three tunnels , 13 to 16 feet ( 4 to 5 meters ) wide at a depth of up to 39 feet ( 12 meters )			0
his team drilled two bore holes to lower a camera , but before they could , they detected two underground explosions and their drill holes were blocked			0
@entity3 is certain that @entity4 soldiers were working beneath their feet , protecting the tunnel			1
@entity4 upgrades space center for larger rockets a history of tunnels four tunnels from the @entity4 have been found in all , although none since 1990			1
the @entity36 still officially looks for them as it believes there may be 20 in all , but the budget is small and tunnel hunters believe it is merely a token effort			2
@entity4 has said the tunnels were not for invasion , but part of its mining industry			1
while the @entity46 believes there may be up to several tunnels dug under the @entity49 , it is convinced that none would reach as far as @entity0			1
it believes that @entity51 would not be able to dig more than 6 miles ( 10 kilometers ) from the @entity52 -- the heavily fortified border -- because of the @entity54			1
@entity0 's northwestern boundary is about 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) from the @entity52			1
" to dig tunnels tens of kilometers , it must be angled properly , " says @entity46 spokesman @entity56			0
" there is a huge amount of groundwater in the @entity63 , so water and soil have to be removed consistently			0
@entity1 and the @entity66 have always taken aerial photographs , and we found no evidence of this			2
" a view from a former @entity4 official but a former intelligence official from @entity4 says the notion is not as far - fetched as it might sound			0
the military defector , who is not using his name as he still has family in the @entity4 , said @entity4 " usually pulled out soil and stones during the night so as not to be detected by the @entity66 or @entity1			1
they dig into the ground vertically from 100 to 150 meters ( 328 to 492 feet ) and slope upwards to @entity1 so the water drains back to the @entity4			1
" the man says he had knowledge of the tunnel digging when he lived in the @entity4			2
saying that operations peaked in the 1980s , he believes @entity51 would still protect the multiple tunnels it dug over many decades			1
" i was told the tunnels are not directly connected to the streets of @entity0 because of the risk of being detected			2
the tunnels are connected to the sewers linked to the relevant organizations			0
" the relevant organizations that would be targeted are the @entity66 embassy , the @entity97 presidential compound and government buildings , he says			0
the former official says that in case of war , infantry troops would flood into the tunnels dressed in @entity66 or @entity1 uniforms			2
the tunnels would then be blown up behind them so there would be no retreat			0
but in recent years , many suspected tunnels have been proved false			0
and concerns about @entity51 have shifted to its nuclear ambitions and long - range ballistic missiles			0
tunnel hunters do not always get much respect in @entity1			2
but @entity3 , and others who have dedicated their time and money to the search , say the government should not ignore the threat they believe exists under their very feet .			0

*ex-* @entity1 general suspects a @entity4 tunnel is under a @entity0 apartment block
but @entity127 believes tunnels ca *n't* extend beyond 6 miles from the @entity52
a defector says tunnel operations peaked in the 1980s
