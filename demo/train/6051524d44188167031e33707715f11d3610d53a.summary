-- football season is officially over			1
all 726 collegiate @entity1 are in the books			0
the ink is dry on @entity5			0
and after a safety and ensuing punt officially closed the lights on the @entity11 season , sports lovers are left to ponder one extremely heavy - hearted question : " now what ? " with all due respect to the boys of summer , pigskin has shoved its way ahead of all other sports , using two heavily gloved hands to grab hold of the mantle as @entity23 's @entity22			1
but simply because football has taken a knee for a few months , that does n't mean the average fan needs to go into hibernation			2
here now , seven suitable substitutes to keep us all warm during the winter			2
@entity32 -- in case you were unaware , which would be entirely understandable , relations have thawed between the world 's best ice hockey players and those who sign their checks			1
( note : it 's likely that most financial transactions actually occur care of direct deposit , but let 's not split hairs , especially when it comes to those sporting iconic mullets			2
) the business is no longer in the front , and the party is in fact back , because after a 113 - day lockout , which cost the league some 625 games and more than half a season , in mid-january the @entity32 returned to rinks across @entity23			1
after long labor standoff , @entity32 players finally back on ice now with a condensed season ( 48 games for each club ) that began roughly three weeks ago , each skate means that much more			1
" barns " will be a rockin ' , and teeth will go a flyin ' , as goal - scorers and enforcers alike are forced to ratchet up their intensity and sharpen up their elbows			0
so pull your favorite team sweater out of the closet and dust off your abacus -- it 's time to re-calculate " plus - minus			1
" and toss the @entity78 back into your medicine cabinet , because it 's never too early to start cultivating that playoff beard			1
@entity81 -- we 're still a handful of @entity84 drives from hearing @entity86 's signature " @entity87 " as the @entity89 mic - master welcomes us to @entity90 in @entity91 , reminding all that it remains " a tradition unlike any other			2
" and while april and @entity95 truly announce golf season , there are early signs to suggest the @entity81 is nearing full swing			0
on january 31 , @entity99 came within a breath of posting only the sixth sub- 60 round of all - time , and three days later @entity103 rookie @entity102 took the training wheels off golf 's first celebratory @entity105 putting green jig			2
certainly , we 're a far cry from seeing @entity109 paired with @entity110 at @entity111 , but weekends spent watching the world 's best play 36 holes , against some of the world 's most captivating backgrounds ? that 's one way to beat february 's frozen tundra			2
@entity99 flirts with history in wire - to - wire @entity125 win 3			0
@entity126 -- there is a prevailing theory that suggests the average fan does n't begin paying attention to on - campus hoops until after the @entity132			0
ok then , here we go ! with perennial powerhouses like @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 all littering the top 10 , the rankings feel like a familiar throw blanket under which one might curl , as temperatures in @entity146 and @entity147 country drop to mirroring single digits			0
but with no undefeated or one - loss teams to be found , and four schools having claimed the no. 1 ranking in each of the last four weeks , expect the hardwood to heat up significantly as we dribble toward @entity153			1
the @entity155 's @entity154 -- if you 're feeling old , this wo n't help			1
on february 17 , the greatest player to slip on sneakers turns 50			1
while @entity160 's @entity162 career often centered around an epic accumulation of numbers ( more than 32,000 points , 10 scoring titles , 6 world championships , ) seeing a sixth decade is an accomplishment unique unto itself , especially in as much as it will occur exactly on the evening of the game in which he starred 14 times			1
beginning february 15 , the @entity155 's @entity154 blasts off from @entity173 , and " his airness " figures to be prominently featured throughout the festivities			1
long before " @entity180 " and the " @entity181 " had their own signature swoosh , every kid in @entity23 wanted to " @entity182 " 5			0
the @entity183 referred to as the " @entity184 , " the green flag drops from northern @entity186 on february 24 , bringing about a season that will feature such fanciful phrases as " restrictor plate racing " and " @entity190 ! ! ! " now why the sport holds its biggest event to begin the season is still as curious as the notion that @entity194 could list the left - directional as the sport 's most important piece of equipment			1
nonetheless , with " the @entity184 " just around the corner in @entity201 , it 's time to refamiliarize ourselves with a world in which " drafting " has nothing to do with the @entity205 , nor anyone 's baseball keeper league			0
the @entity210 - speaking of all things diamond , we 're officially within a week from hearing the four most magical words in any baseball fan 's vocabulary : " pitchers and catchers report			2
" but in the event that the start of spring training is n't enough for the average fungo fanatic , this years @entity221 and @entity222 schedules will wrestle with the welcome interruption that comes care of the @entity210 ( first pitch , march 2 )			0
created in 2005 as an answer to hardball being pulled from the @entity230 , the 2013 tournament will be the third edition of the international event , and it arrives carrying a catcher 's mitt full of story lines			0
can anyone dethrone two - time champion @entity237 ? how will opposing @entity210 pitchers deal with a loaded lineup coming out of @entity241 ( @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 hitting 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ) ? and just how slick will a @entity247 infield be that could put @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 all on the lip of the grass at the same time ? 7			0
@entity256 - even though fans will be without the pleasure of watching an actual , meaningful football game until after @entity259 , there will be plenty of tertiary topics to digest between now and the next series of opening kick - offs			2
switching into a three - day format in 2010 , and gobbling up a primetime position in the process , the popularity of the @entity11 draft has increased exponentially , comparing favorably with the vertical leap and 40 - time of your average " @entity272 " linebacker			1
but before a single war room phone rings , and prior to the donning of any brand new @entity277 team caps , a week at the scouting combine in @entity278 ( february 20 - 26 ) , gives football fans the chance to punch up the @entity281 and join stopwatch - toting gms in evaluating the latest crop of linemen as though they were livestock			1
in the days that follow , avid @entity11 aficionados will wear out their index finger refreshing @entity289 and @entity291 's latest mock drafts			0
and @entity294 coast - to - coast will overflow with push notifications blasting the latest trade rumors			0
come the april 25 draft fans will descend upon @entity299 's famed @entity298 in hopes of hearing their favorite club call the name of a left tackle who can protect their quarterback 's blindside for the next decade			0
until then , the @entity307 are on the clock for the rest of us , there 's plenty to watch .			0

football season is over , but @entity0 's @entity314 has your guide to *reasonable* substitutes
hockey 's back after a 113 - day lockout that cost the @entity32 625 games and over half a season
as for college basketball , @entity314 says to " expect the hardwood to heat up significantly "
@entity160 will turn 50 on february 17 during the @entity155 's 62nd all - star weekend
