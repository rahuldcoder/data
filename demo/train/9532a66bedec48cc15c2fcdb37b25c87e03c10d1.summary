-- @entity1 did not die in vain			2
@entity3 may have dedicated a good part of the last decade to torturing @entity5 , but he 's also found the time , the energy and the clout to pull off his first film as director			1
by any standards , " @entity16 " is an ambitious undertaking , a modern - day interpretation of one of @entity15 's meatiest but less frequently performed plays			1
although not everything comes off , @entity3 ' bold , dynamic movie will make you glad he took up the challenge			1
set in " some place calling itself @entity22 , " but filmed , very tellingly , in battle - scarred @entity23 and @entity24 , " @entity16 " imagines a modern state rocked by food shortages and border disputes			1
gen. @entity28 ( @entity3 ) returns triumphant from vanquishing archenemy @entity16 ( @entity30 ) and the @entity31 from their stronghold , @entity34 , and takes on the name of this , his most famous victory			1
but an attempt to make him consul , or head of state , alarms some senators who know his contempt for ordinary civilians			2
while he easily carries the @entity46 , tradition demands that @entity28 , now known as " @entity16 , " must also seek the assent of the citizenry in the public market			1
too proud to court public opinion , he goes through the motions , but when his enemies turn the crowd against him , his fury only makes matters worse and the general is banished from @entity22			2
alone and angry , he swears vengeance and offers his services to @entity59			0
as in other modern - dress @entity62 adaptations , there are anomalies and eccentricities in this production , which brandishes guns and tanks but talks of swords and ultimately falls back on knife fights			0
the notion of the warrior - hero who can carry battles single - handedly does n't really jibe with modern warfare , and it 's been a while since we had a military man as president			0
@entity15 's play leaves no doubt that however we value heroism on the battlefield , it 's no qualification for success in politics			0
coriolanus is undone by his own peculiar integrity , a refusal to exploit his war record for votes ; but only because he finds the democratic process demeaning -- he 's a pure elitist , the kind of person who believes that birthright is destiny			2
in power , he 'd be a disaster			0
not that the scheming , cynical professional politicians come out much better in this telling , or the fickle and easily manipulated populace for that matter			0
politics is a dirty business , but @entity16 betrays everyone he 's ever known to uphold his own warped sense of honor			1
@entity110 shaved , scarred , and often caked in blood , @entity3 is utterly compelling , a kind of @entity113			1
we know he can play villains , but even if he 's essentially a fascist , there is something noble about @entity16 , and tragic , too , in his inability to bend or compromise			1
he is his own man , though we see very well that he 's entirely the creation of his ferocious mother , @entity122 ( a magnificent @entity122 ) , and ultimately powerless before her			0
substantially streamlined by screenwriter and playwright @entity124 ( whose scripts for " @entity126 " and " @entity127 " also made it to the screen last year ) , @entity15 's verse sounds a bit strange in the voice of cable tv newscasters , but the device works very well to convey background information and keep the action flowing			0
@entity124 has cut the play in half , but what it loses in detail the movie more than picks up in clarity and punch			2
budget constraints probably account for @entity22 's surprisingly meager population and a @entity146 army that seems to number about two dozen , but you ca n't argue with the talent in the foreground : @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity30 do n't misplace a single syllable between them			0
this is @entity62 acting of the highest caliber , and a powerful , bloody vision of " honor " gone mad .			0

by any standards , " @entity16 " is an ambitious undertaking
@entity3 ' bold , dynamic movie will make you glad he took up the challenge
@entity3 is utterly compelling , a kind of @entity113
