-- @entity2 authorities say they 're not certain when a new search area for missing @entity4 will be announced , clarifying earlier statements suggesting it would be made public wednesday			1
@entity7 , the commissioner of the @entity8 , or @entity8 , said tuesday that the analysis of the relevant data will be completed this week , but that " before we release , we have to talk with the @entity12 who are responsible for the overall investigation			2
" the @entity8 , the agency leading the underwater search for the plane , had said sunday that the new search area would be announced wednesday			1
" we are waiting for the @entity12 to get back to us on that , " @entity7 said tuesday			2
" i suspect we will know when within the next 24 hours			0
" more than three months after flight 370 disappeared over @entity21 , searchers have found no trace of the @entity23 or the 239 people aboard , making it one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history			0
@entity7 said he expects that the new analysis of the data from satellites , radar and other sources will shift the search area farther south in the @entity33			1
but he said the team of experts that has been poring over the available information is n't relying on the @entity12 military 's primary radar data as a measure of changes in altitude during the passenger jet 's mysterious flight on march 8			1
reports that emerged in the early stages of the investigation had suggested the plane may have made dramatic changes in altitude after it turned sharply off its scheduled path from @entity51 , @entity12 , to @entity52			0
@entity0 safety analyst @entity53 says information about altitude changes is important because it directly affects the calculation of the new search area			2
if the plane did not rise and fall sharply , " it changes the amount of time and the distance that the aircraft could have flown , " he said			0
if the plane did not make sharp changes in altitude , it would have flown farther and moved farther south than the original search area			1
authorities have not been able to explain why the jet veered dramatically off course			0
outside group tells governments where to search for @entity4 a hole in the clouds , an empty space on earth			0

the new search area may not be announced as soon as wednesday
" we are waiting for the @entity12 to get back to us , " a senior @entity2 official says
analysts have been *re-evaluating* satellite and radar data
the search area is expected to move farther south in the @entity33
