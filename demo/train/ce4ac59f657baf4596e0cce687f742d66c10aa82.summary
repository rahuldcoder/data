-- last month the @entity2 talk i gave was posted online			1
now it has been viewed over a million times			1
the talk itself is nothing groundbreaking			2
it 's a couple of stories and observations about working as a model for the last decade			1
i gave the talk because i wanted to tell an honest personal narrative of what privilege means			2
i wanted to answer questions like how did i become a model			1
i always just say , " i was scouted , " but that means nothing			2
the real way that i became a model is that i won a genetic lottery , and i am the recipient of a legacy			1
what do i mean by legacy ? well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we 're biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , slender figures , and femininity and white skin			1
and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it 's a legacy that i 've been cashing in on			1
some fashionistas may think , " wait			2
" but the truth is that in 2007 when an inspired @entity45 student counted all the models on the runway , of the 677 models hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non-white			2
usually @entity2 only invites the most accomplished and famous people in the world to give talks			2
i hoped telling a simple story -- where my only qualification was life experience ( not a degree , award , successful business or book ) -- could encourage those of us who make media to elevate other personal narratives : the stories of someone like @entity66 , the undocumented worker , the candidate without money for press			2
instead my talk reinforced the observations i highlighted in it : that beauty and femininity and race have made me the candy of mass media , the " once you pop you just ca n't stop " of news			1
in particular it is the barrage of media requests i 've had that confirm that how i look and what i do for a living attracts enormous undeserved attention			1
do i want a tv show ? do i want to write a book ? do i want to appear in a movie ? do i want to speak to @entity0 , @entity88 , @entity89 , the @entity90 , @entity91 , this blogger and that journal ? do i want to speak at this high school , at that college , at @entity96 or at other conferences ? @entity98 : a teen just trying to figure it out i am not a uniquely accomplished 25 - year - old			1
i 've modeled for 10 years and i took six years to finish my undergraduate degree part - time , graduating this past june with honors from @entity104			2
if i ever had needed to put together a cv it would be quite short			0
like many young people i 'd highlight my desire to work hard			1
but hard work is not why i have been successful as a model			1
i 'm not saying i 'm lazy			0
but the most important part of my job is to show up with a 23 - inch waist , looking young , feminine and white			0
this should n't really shock anyone			0
models are chosen solely based on looks			0
but what was shocking to me is that when i spoke , the way i look catapulted what i had to say on to the front page			0
even if i did give a good talk , is what i have to say more important and interesting than what @entity124 said ? ( he spoke at the same event and his talk has about a quarter of the view count			0
) @entity98 : @entity129 on fashion and creativity like many young people i believe i have potential to make a positive impact in the world			1
but if i speak from a platform that relies on how i look , i worry that i will not have made room for anyone else to come after me			0
i will have reinforced that beauty and race and privilege get you a news story			1
the schoolteacher without adequate support , the domestic worker without rights , they wo n't be up there with me			0
so what do i do ? i am being handed press when good press for important issues is hard to come by			1
these outlets are the same outlets that spent two years not reporting a new drone base in @entity156 while press in the @entity158 covered it			0
they are the same organizations that have forgotten @entity161 and forgotten to follow up on contractors who are n't fulfilling their responsibilities there -- important not only for the people of @entity167 , but also for setting a precedent for the victims of @entity170 , and of the many storms to come whose frequency and severity will rise as our climate changes			0
com : @entity176 on where creativity hides should i tell stories like these instead of my own ? i do n't feel like i have the authority or experience to do so			0
how can we change this cycle ? the rise of the @entity185 and the camera phone have started to change what stories are accessible			0
and we now have the ability to build more participatory media structures			0
the internet often comes up with good answers to difficult questions			0
so i ask : how can we build media platforms accessible to a diversity of content creators ? on a personal note , what should i talk about ? do i refuse these offers outright because of my lack of experience , because i 'm not the right person to tell the stories that are missing from the media ? can i figure out a way to leverage my access to bring new voices into the conversation ? right now i 'm cautiously accepting a few requests and figuring out what it all means			0
i 'm listening , tweet me @ cameroncrussell the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

model @entity214 's @entity98 has been viewed more than a million times
she says , as winner of " genetic lottery , " she has been able to have a modeling **career**
her looks fit a narrow *definition* of beauty , she says
@entity214 : i work hard but my modeling **career** gives my views undeserved attention
