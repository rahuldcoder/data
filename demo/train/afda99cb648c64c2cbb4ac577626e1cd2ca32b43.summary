@entity0 , @entity1 -- critics have traditionally had a field day slamming @entity0 as an event where the elite hop on their private jets to quaff champagne and pat each other on the back			2
where nothing of any value ( except to those present ) ever occurs			2
and ten , or maybe even five years ago , they were probably right			2
watch : davos live : all the action from @entity17 2013 but since then , business and governments have had a massive wake up call			1
and @entity0 is becoming a very different event			2
social media has empowered people to hold business and leaders accountable and to sanction and even remove those who behave in the wrong way			1

" every week we see a new example of this -- from @entity32 to @entity33 , from @entity34 to @entity35 , from the @entity36 to @entity37 to @entity38			2
as @entity43 ceo @entity42 -- who chose the 2010 @entity17 as the venue to launch his plan to double @entity43 's revenue while halving its carbon footprint -- said in an interview recently : " the consumer is able to identify responsible businesses from less responsible businesses			1
the pressure is higher but if you then deliver you will be rewarded more			0
" the new price of doing well is doing good and @entity42 seems to have the proof			1
" @entity43 has one of its fastest growth rates now , " he said			0
" we have just passed the â ‚ ¬ 50 billion barrier -- since 2011 we have created a @entity59 or a @entity60 in incremental turnover without affecting the bottom line			0
" read more : all you need to know to be a @entity0 delegate @entity66 ceo @entity65 is another leader who understands both the challenges of operating in this era of radical transparency , and the power of social media			1
at the @entity72 in october he told delegates about the screen in his office that carried a rolling @entity77 feed of tweets about @entity66			0
on the day the libor scandal broke , @entity65 said it became an angry torrent , too quick to follow			0
last week , he wrote to the 140,000 @entity66 staff telling them : " the rules have changed			0
" he unveiled a new approach for the organization where staff would be assessed on their adherence to a set of values that defines @entity66 's overall purpose in society			0

leaders who passionately believe in the power of business to be a force for good			1
they will both be attending this week to drive their missions , alongside many other ceos -- all of whom understand that far from being a place to hide , they will be under more scrutiny than ever in @entity0			1
at a simplistic level , in the last century @entity109 and charities had great intentions , but not always great execution			0
businesses had great execution , but not always great intentions			1
this century needs to be about , and can be about , great intentions and great execution			0
business can be a major force , in fact , the major force to drive positive change in the world			1
and @entity0 , with its unique ability to bring together ngos and business , can play an important role in that transformation			1
but at the end of the day , actions speak louder than words			0
and all of us attending should keep that front of mind			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			1

social media has brought greater *accountability* to business
business can be a major force to drive social good in the world , says @entity135
he says that businesses that do good in the world do well
