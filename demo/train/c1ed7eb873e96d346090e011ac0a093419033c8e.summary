as the search for the missing @entity4 continues , both the @entity1 government and the airline have come under sharp criticism			1
some say that all involved parties , including the manufacturer @entity8 , are circling their wagons and bracing for a long public relations siege while the families of the missing passengers continue to grieve			1
meanwhile , others have stepped in to help the relatives of the passengers			2
one group of emissaries from the @entity18 has traveled across the globe at their own expense to offer assistance to the grieving families			2
however , instead of being welcomed , their arrival was reported with thinly veiled revulsion			0
i 'm talking about the lawyers			2
the lawyers were described in reports as " descending " on the scene and " hovering " around the families			1
apparently , stereotypes about the legal profession exist around the world			2
but the bias toward lawyers is logically indefensible			2
@entity36 and @entity8 are not charities these gigantic corporations are legally obligated to minimize their financial exposure			1
this means that every move they make is strategically calculated against their legal adversaries			2
and those adversaries are civilians			0
more specifically , they are bereaved mothers , fathers and other family members of those who were aboard flight 370			0
how well do you know the @entity53 ? the @entity53 is an international treaty signed by 97 countries that addresses the liability of air carriers in international flights			1
it contains strict limitations on the time in which a claim may be brought			0
it holds a carrier strictly liable in the approximate amount of $ 175,000 per passenger in the case of an " accident			1
" however , if a plaintiff is seeking an amount in excess of the prescribed ( approximately ) $ 175,000 , the convention permits the carrier to prove the damage was not due to the negligence of the carrier or was solely due to the negligence of another party			1
so , the airlines may be able to legally minimize their loss to only $ 175,000 per person if they can blame someone or something else			1
it is widely agreed that @entity18 courts will be the best venue for the families , but the convention has strict rules about where the families can file suit			1
if these families can not figure out how to navigate the convention 's jurisdictional complexities , they will be stuck litigating against an airline in a courthouse in @entity95 , when they might have sought justice in a @entity18 court			2
did you know all that ? if you did n't know it , then do you expect a family from @entity104 , @entity105 , should have to research this in the local law library ? of course not			2
they are entitled to legal help , and it 's never too soon to get them help			0
' too soon ' does n't apply to legal representation if you did n't know even these basics about the convention , how fair is it for a working - class @entity105 family to navigate the complexities of the treaty in an @entity18 court ? the logic is inescapable : these families should not be required to litigate these complicated issues in court alone			1
they should have attorneys to help them			0
and if we agree that they should have lawyers , then they should have them from the outset of the adversarial process			0
after all , do you think @entity8 and @entity36 think it 's " too soon " to consult with their attorneys ? if these corporate juggernauts are entitled to counsel , it stands to reason that a grieving mother of a @entity105 flight 370 passenger with zero legal training is , too			1
safeguards of the republic lawyers are the " safeguards of the republic ; " they are the last bastion of defense for the populace against the government and large corporations			0
during his extended stay in @entity18 , @entity152 political historian @entity151 observed that @entity18 lawyers would be best positioned to guard against tyranny and protect natural rights in a mass democracy			0
the families of flight 370 passengers will receive the services of highly skilled attorneys who will take on the costs of litigating this case against @entity36 , a risky venture that would consume a good deal of time , resources and effort			1
the families will not have to front one dollar , ringgit , or yuan			0
what other skilled profession provides services , advancing all the costs , and charges no fees unless you have a successful outcome ? try that with your doctor			0
see if he 'll operate on your herniated disc with the proviso that you 'll only pay if the surgery is a pain - free success			0
even the controversial @entity185 never dreamed of an expansion of patient rights to this degree			0
of course , attorneys stand to earn fees from contingent fee cases , but they also acquire all the risk ; they lose every penny they invest in a client if the case is unsuccessful			0
an attorney who takes on a high - risk contingent fee case invites financial ruin if he or she does n't prevail			1
no one expects the families of the missing passengers — already undergoing a traumatic experience — to single - handedly deal with corporations in full damage - control mode			0
even if it 's true that the prospective plaintiffs ' lawyers in this case stand to profit from this case , @entity36 and @entity8 are trying to save many millions by managing their legal exposures			1
that the lawyers are described as " descending " on the scene shows that we 've come a long way from @entity151 's positive view of legal counsel			1
certainly , the practice of law has changed significantly since that time			0
the robed barristers of centuries past bear little resemblance to lawyers like @entity226 , who recently advertised during the @entity227			0
but whether they are bearing white wigs or flaming sledgehammers , all are officers of the court , and all should try to help the masses who could use legal counsel at times of tragedy .			1

@entity238 : families of @entity4 need legal counsel
@entity238 : @entity36 and @entity8 are looking to minimize their financial risks
he says a treaty limits carriers to pay $ 175,000 per passenger in accidents
@entity238 : do n't criticize the lawyers , because they can help relatives file claims
