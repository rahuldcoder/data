-- despite the arrival of two holiday heavyweights , " @entity3 : an @entity7 " retained the top spot at the box office for the third weekend in a row			1
@entity9 ' $ 250 million fantasy prequel was held out of the top spot from tuesday until thursday by " @entity11 , " but over the traditional weekend frame " @entity3 " dipped only 11 percent to bring in $ 32.9 million , and its domestic total now stands tall at $ 222.7 million			1
after 17 days , " @entity3 " is performing well ahead of 2001 ′ s " @entity13 , " which had earned $ 189.3 million at the same point in its run ( though that number climbs to about $ 260 million after accounting for inflation ) , but it still trails the 17 - day cumes of " @entity19 " ( $ 243.6 million ) , and " @entity20 " ( $ 272.8 million )			1
notably , those films did not have 3d or @entity23 surcharges boosting their totals			0
this is not meant to imply that " @entity3 " is underperforming			1
like so many modern @entity28 tentpoles , @entity3 's strong business overseas is the main component of its success			2
on friday , the film smashed through the $ 600 million mark worldwide , and by the time the ball drops , its worldwide total will likely have surpassed $ 700 million			2
that 's a treasure that would impress even @entity36			0
in second place , " @entity42 " galloped away with a terrific $ 30.7 million over the friday - to - sunday period , bringing its total to $ 64 million since its @entity41 day debut			1
the @entity44 - directed @entity43 , which the @entity45 says cost $ 87 million to produce , has performed remarkably well for a controversial , @entity47 - rated film in a season often dominated by family - friendly / inspirational tales			2
last year , many blamed a poor release date for the lackluster performance of " @entity53 , " which settled for $ 102.5 million total , but " @entity56 's " fantastic opening week counters those assumptions			2
get ew on your tablet : subscribe today and get instant access ! given its robust debut , " @entity42 " will very likely become @entity44 's highest - grossing film ahead of 2009 ′ s " @entity65 , " which earned $ 120.5 million total			1
@entity67 has every reason to believe it will reach that level			0
not only was @entity56 's $ 10,195 per theater average ( from 3,010 theaters ) the best in the @entity73 , it earned an " a- " @entity75 grade from polled audiences , which were 56 percent male			2
after winning @entity41 day and spending its first three days atop the box office , " @entity11 " finished the weekend in third place with $ 28.0 million			2
@entity85 's $ 61 million adaptation of the beloved operetta ( which is , in turn , an adaptation of @entity89 's 1862 novel ) has earned a terrific $ 67.4 million in its first six days ( plus another $ 48.7 million internationally ) , and although it has exhibited some frontloadedness due to up - front excitement from passionate fans , its " a " @entity75 grade ( and ample awards buzz ) should help it hold up in the weeks to come			2
" @entity11 " has already outgrossed the last december - released musical , nine , which flopped with just $ 19.7 million in 2009 , and it will quickly surpass " dreamgirls , " which opened in december 2006 and scored $ 103.4 million total , as well			0
only time will tell whether " @entity11 " can match the impressive $ 170.7 million total of @entity97 , which began a platform release in december 2002 and rode a wave of awards attention to box office glory , but for now , its prospects do n't look miserable at all			0
@entity106 's @entity105 / @entity104 vehicle " @entity107 " survived poor reviews and earned a not - bad $ 14.8 million over the weekend — the exact same amount it earned in its first three days of release			0
after six days , @entity107 has earned $ 29.6 million against a modest $ 25 million budget , and with an " a- " @entity75 grade and a dearth of family - oriented competition , it should hold up nicely in the new year			0
@entity123 's $ 60 million @entity122 thriller " @entity120 " rounded out the @entity117 with $ 14.0 million , marking a 10 percent drop from its inauspicious debut			1
after ten days , the novel adaptation has earned a rather unimpressive $ 44.7 million			0
the @entity3 — $ 32.9 million 2			1
@entity42 — $ 30.7 million 3			1
@entity11 — $ 28.0 million 4			0
parental guidance — $ 14.8 million 5			1
@entity120 — $ 14.0 million in milestone news , " @entity130 " reached the $ 1 billion mark at the worldwide box office this weekend			1
it is the fourteenth film to ever reach that mark			0
next week , " @entity133 " will attempt to cut down " @entity3 " and " @entity42			1
" will it prevail ? check back to @entity0 to find out			0
