" he recalled that the 16 - year - old identified himself as a sophomore and student newspaper editor from @entity10 , who was " in town ( and ) had some questions to ask me			1
" describing the teen as " articulate , " the principal -- who has been at @entity5 for 33 years , the last 16 as a principal -- said there were no " red flags " in his line of questioning			1
" he was n't asking about , can you show me where the bombs were ? can you show me where people died ? " @entity150 said friday			0
" it was just , what are you doing ? how do you help your kids ? and things like that			0
" according to police documents , the 16 - year - old later told authorities that he did not want to be compared to the @entity5 killers because he was smart enough to kill more people			1
