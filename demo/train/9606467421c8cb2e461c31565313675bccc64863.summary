@entity1 , a wealthy businessman and executive with a notable charity had seen on @entity0 how earthquake victims had been trucked out of @entity18 and disposed in @entity8 without burial			1
upset , he put his own resources to work and hired bulldozers to dig mass graves for 2,500 bodies			0
he said then that it was sacrilege so many people had not been given proper internment			0
he did n't want to blame anyone for the aftermath of @entity3 's tragedy ; he was simply grateful to be able to help			1
now , @entity1 stands poised to be able to do a lot more for his country			1
@entity3 's new president @entity32 tapped the successful entrepreneur to become the troubled nation 's next prime minister			1
unknown in @entity3 politics , @entity1 at first was not even sure he wanted to enter a new realm			1

until recently , @entity32 , of course , was better known as @entity32 , a wildly popular bad boy of music			0
@entity32 said he tapped @entity1 because the two men share a vision for a prosperous @entity3			1
" @entity1 is a man of integrity , " @entity32 said			2

@entity3 remains the poorest and least developed country in the @entity72 and is struggling to recover from the 2010 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and displaced 1.6 million others			1
hundreds of thousands of those people are still eeking out existances in makeshift camps			0
the @entity79 estimated that the cost of rebuilding homes , roads , schools and other infrastructure could be as much as $ 14 billion.the international community pledged $ 10 billion in march , 2010 but evidence of that money is scant			0
a year after the earthquake , there are still mounds of rubble stacked high in parts of @entity18			0
@entity3 's problems were compounded by a cholera epidemic that erupted last october and has resurged recently as the rainy season begins			2
part of the reason @entity32 won at the polls is because @entity3 had increasingly grown discontent with the slow pace of recovery and reconstruction			2

" he has a good reputation , " @entity105 said			0
" he strikes me as somebody who is well - intentioned			0
" but as with all others who have entered politics in @entity3 , @entity1 will have to rise above entrenched corruption , @entity105 said			1
if he becomes prime minister , @entity1 will inherit a government that was barely functioning , @entity105 said			1
" one of his challenges is to rebuild the government from the ground up , " he said			0

@entity1 , said @entity105 , will help @entity32 in challenging a mindset that has hindered @entity3 in the past			1
" there is so much to be done , " @entity1 said			2
" it 's not going to be easy			0
