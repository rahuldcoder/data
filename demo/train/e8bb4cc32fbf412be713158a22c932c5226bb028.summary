an interactive map showing the names and addresses of all handgun permit holders in @entity7 's @entity5 and @entity6 counties has infuriated many readers since it was posted saturday on a newspaper 's website			1
the map , published by @entity12 , allows readers to zoom in on red dots that indicate which residents are licensed to own pistols or revolvers			1
it had prompted more than 1,700 comments as of wednesday morning			0
blue dots indicate permit holders who " have purchased a firearm or updated the information on a permit in the past five years			1
" " so should we start wearing yellow stars of @entity30 so the general public can be aware of who we are ? ? " one commenter wrote			0
" this is crazy ! " wrote another			0
opinion : guns endanger more than they protect some of those responding threatened to cancel their subscriptions or boycott the publication			0
" i hope you lose readers now , " one wrote			1
the paper 's publisher , @entity42 , president of the @entity43 , defended the decision in a statement wednesday			1
" one of our roles is to report publicly available information on timely issues , even when unpopular			1
we knew publication of the database ( as well as the accompanying article providing context ) would be controversial , but we felt sharing information about gun permits in our area was important in the aftermath of the @entity62 shootings , " she said			1
the newspaper also said it had wanted to publish even more information			1
" we were surprised when we were n't able to obtain information on what kinds and how many weapons people in our market own , " the newspaper said in a statement			1
county clerks ' offices had told the paper that " the public does not have the right to see specific permits an individual has been issued , the types of handguns a person possesses or the number of guns he or she owns , " the statement said			1
" had we been able to obtain those records , we would have published them			2
" the map came about in the wake of the massacre in @entity62 , @entity90 , @entity12 said			0
" in the past week , conversation on our opinion pages and on our website , @entity12 , has been keenly focused on gun control , " the newspaper 's editor and vice president , @entity93 , said in a statement tuesday			1
the names and addresses of the two counties ' permit - holding residents were obtained through the @entity103			0
the website notes that the map does not indicate whether the residents own handguns , only that they are legally able to , and that the data do not pertain to rifles or shotguns , which can be bought without a permit			2
@entity112 doubles down : new gun laws wo n't work still , hundreds of residents were shocked to see their information posted without their being notified			2
some said the map would prompt burglaries because thieves are now aware of where weapons might be found			0
" now everyone knows where the legal guns are kept , a valuable piece of information for criminals , " a commenter wrote			0
" why do n't you do something helpful , like trying to find out where the illegal guns are kept ? " a great majority of readers commenting at @entity137 were opposed to the newspaper 's move , but some defended it on the grounds that the public has a right to know who might own weapons			1
one commenter wrote : " if you 're a gun owner it 's a matter of public record			1
if you 're embarrassed by your gun , get rid of it			2
i have a car and a house -- they 're no secret			0
people contact me all the time trying to sell me stuff			0
i do n't expect a right to privacy for these things			0
" another wrote , " every gun manufactured , transferred , and sold should be on the internet , all on one website , including date of purchase , current owner , stored location , and gun license number			2
" several @entity171 commenters also came out in support in tweets to @entity137 : -- " the gun permit maps are an effective way of showing how horribly widespread gun ownership is			2
" -- " please thank them			0
this could be a turning point			0
i do not want my daughter playing in a house with guns			0
" -- " love the @entity184 map ! excellent information to anyone concerned with who they live around ! " the @entity12 argued that residents have a right to access information regarding weapon holders in @entity5 and @entity6 communities			0
" our readers are understandably interested to know about guns in their neighborhoods , " @entity93 said in her statement			1
in an article about the uproar , @entity12 says many of the thousands of people who " have taken to their computers and phones in rage " live outside the counties covered by the map			0
in searching through hundreds of comments listed on the website , @entity137 did not immediately see any in support of the newspaper 's decision to publish the interactive map			1
the @entity12 said it published an article in 2006 that received similar responses , but this time around , social media spread the story far and wide			1
in 2007 , roanoke.com , the website of the @entity219 , published a list of @entity221 licensed to carry concealed weapons , and then deleted it the next day			2
the paper explained that the list , originally published as part of an opinion column , was removed " out of concern that it might include names that should not have been made public			2
" the @entity229 , a school for journalists , notes that some other news agencies have published various types of databases as well			1
" publishing gun owners ' names makes them targets for theft or public ridicule			2
it is journalistic arrogance to abuse public record privilege , just as it is to air 911 calls for no reason or to publish the home addresses of police or judges without cause , " @entity238 , a @entity229 senior faculty member , said in a statement wednesday			1
" unwarranted publishing of the names of permitted owners just encourages gun owners to skip the permitting			0
" the paper said @entity93 was not available for interviews wednesday			0
little common ground between pro- and anti-gun forces			0

the publisher issues a statement supporting the decision
other news agencies have published similar databases in the past
@entity229 senior faculty member calls newspaper 's move " journalist arrogance "
" readers are understandably interested " in gun data , newspaper editor says
