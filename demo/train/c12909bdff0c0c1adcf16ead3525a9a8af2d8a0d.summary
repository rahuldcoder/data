-- the deficit and debt are major concerns for swing voters -- and president @entity5 and @entity6 have very different visions of how to deal with it			1
that 's why it was significant to see 80 ceos of major @entity13 companies sign a letter this past week committing to press for a balanced bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit and debt no matter which candidate is elected president on november 6			1
the words " balanced " and " bipartisan " are key here -- because the @entity11 understand that this problem is too big to be solved by tax hikes or spending cuts alone			1
we ca n't simply tax or cut our way out of this problem			0
instead , the @entity11 backed the outlines of the @entity28 , which attracted bipartisan support with its plan to cut spending , rein in entitlements and increase tax revenue through lower rates while closing loopholes and deductions			1
their vision is also consistent with the plan proposed by the @entity40 senators who came up with their own formula along the same broad outlines -- cut spending , bending the entitlement cost curve and raise tax revenue			2
conservative and liberal senators running the ideological spectrum from @entity49 to @entity50 have managed to agree on this outline , buoyed by the heroic efforts of centrists like @entity54 and @entity55 , in addition to the bipartisan duo of @entity58 and @entity59 themselves			0
these individuals worked with the nonpartisan @entity62 and their @entity64 project to corral the @entity11 ' support			2
the ceos in question include prominent @entity6 donors like @entity70 ceo @entity69 and @entity72 ceo @entity71 , whose company gave a $ 4 million donation to the @entity13 @entity77 's conservative 501 - @entity76 organization , which has already put more than $ 15 million into this election			1
what 's surprising is that the @entity11 ' commitment to a balanced bipartisan plan puts them much closer to @entity5 's deficit reduction plan than to @entity6 's			1
that 's because it also dovetails with the outlines of the @entity86 negotiated by @entity5 and @entity88 speaker @entity87 in the summer of 2011 , only to have negotiations fall apart			2
@entity6 has repeatedly and specifically said that he will not consider any plan that raises any increased tax revenue to pay down the deficit and the debt			1
during the @entity95 primaries , he famously joined with his competitors in raising his hand to say that he would reject even a 10 - to - 1 deal splitting spending cuts with tax revenue increases			1
the @entity28 plan was based on an even less generous 3 - to - 1 split ( though of course , still weighted decidedly in favor of spending cuts )			1
this is not an academic difference			0
it goes to the heart of what kind of deficit reduction can be realistically achieved as a matter of both politics and math. a plan that does not include any new revenues is not practical in terms of achieving the larger goal			0
" when you talk about a $ 16 trillion debt , i do n't see how you can avoid addressing both sides " -- both spending cuts and revenue increases -- said @entity70 ceo @entity69 , sensibly			1
an imbalanced and ideologically pure solution without any revenue increases would be @entity125 with @entity126 in the @entity127			1
we all know the special - interest stumbling blocks -- liberal activists do n't want to see entitlement reforms			0
they bitterly attacked @entity28 as " the cat food commission			0
" conservative activists and special interests refuse to consider any new tax revenue			0
but the truth is that we need both to find a sustainable solution to our deficit and debt problem			0
to pretend otherwise is a hyper - partisan fantasy			0
@entity6 's vice presidential nominee , @entity141 , is regarded as a serious deficit hawk , and he at least had the courage to put numbers to a budget plan he put forward in @entity146			2
but his plan does not include any new tax revenue or cuts in defense spending -- which is why it does not balance the budget for three decades			1
and when @entity141 served on the @entity28 , he shamefully refused to support its recommendations , along with his fellow @entity95 congressmen @entity155 and @entity156			2
@entity156 later went on to co-helm the failed super committee , which led to the $ 1.2 trillion in blunt sequestration cuts that now loom as part of the year - end " fiscal cliff			2
" and while we 're analyzing deficit reduction plans , in addition to a 20 % across the board additional tax cut , the @entity6 budget also calls for increasing military spending to 4 % of @entity169 , translating to an additional $ 2 trillion in federal spending over 10 years , which would erase all the stated cuts he has so far put forward on his campaign website			1
this aspect of @entity6 's plan is so politically driven and math - illiterate that @entity141 does n't even like to acknowledge it on the campaign trail			2
moreover , it 's worth remembering that the politically convenient model of huge tax cuts and higher spending pursued by president @entity182 and embraced by @entity95 during his administration , turned @entity185 - era surpluses into deficits			0
there 's no question that @entity5 deserves a lot of criticism for not backing the @entity28 plan			1
his proposals have not been submitted as specific legislation and he failed to lead on entitlement reform , despite saying he knows it needs to be done			0
@entity146 has not passed a budget under his watch			0
moreover , his attempts to boost the economy during the @entity200 with the stimulus package contributed to the growth of deficits and debt under his watch			0
that 's why @entity6 clearly leads in the polls on this issue			0
but compared to @entity210 countries that opted for more severe austerity measures , @entity13 's economy is looking pretty good these days , featuring comparative stability , growth and reduced unemployment , no matter how slow			0
bottom line , the @entity11 ' responsible call for a balanced bipartisan plan to reduce the @entity13 deficit and the debt does not remotely look like what @entity6 has proposed to do as president			1
it does look a lot like the plans put forward by the @entity28 , the @entity40 , and outlines of the @entity86 , which @entity5 has said he would put forward again			2
it may sound counterintuitive , but according to the outlines established by the @entity11 , @entity5 's reelection would actually be better for achieving long - term deficit reduction -- because he is the only candidate who has put forward a balanced bipartisan plan			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			0

@entity233 : 80 @entity13 ceos signed letter seeking balanced , partisan plan to tame debt
he says @entity6 has refused to consider a plan that includes revenue increases
@entity233 says the $ 16 trillion debt is too big to be tackled through spending cuts alone
he says @entity11 want something like @entity28 plan , and @entity5 is closer to it
