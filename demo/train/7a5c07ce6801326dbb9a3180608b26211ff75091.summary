@entity0 , daughter of @entity2 mayor - elect @entity1 , has struggled with clinical depression and drug abuse , the 19 - year - old revealed in a @entity7 video posted @entity8			1
" i 've had depression , like clinical depression , for my entire adolescence , " @entity1 says in the video			1
" it made it easier , the more i drank and did drugs , to share some common ground with people that i would n't have			0
it did n't start out as a huge thing for me but then it became a really huge thing for me			0
" in the video , @entity1 speaks about drinking and smoking marijuana when she was in college , as well as the outpatient treatment that started her on the road to recovery			1
@entity28 's father sailed to a landslide victory last month over @entity31 candidate @entity30 to become @entity2 's first @entity33 mayor in more than 20 years			2
one key to his victory was a connection with voters , formed in part via his mixed - race family , particularly his son , @entity41 , and wife , @entity43 , who played a prominent role on the campaign trail			0
@entity0 's story has until now stayed out of the public eye			1
" as parents , our instinct has been to protect our daughter and privately help her through a deeply personal struggle , " her parents said in an e-mail to supporters that linked to the video			1
" but not only has @entity0 committed to her own health , she is also committed to helping young people everywhere who face similar challenges			1
" professionally shot and edited , the @entity7 video was released under an account bearing @entity0 's name			1
it directs viewers to visit ok2talk.org , an organization that encourages youth who struggle with mental illness to talk about their experiences			0
according to the video , @entity0 has completed treatment and is now trying to reach out to others			1
" it 's just important for people to realize , anybody who is watching this , that if you 're suffering and if you 're depressed , you 're dealing with mental illness , and you think that it might have something to do with your drug abuse or drinking , or if you 're just suffering from both of those at the same time and you think that they 're completely unrelated to one another , " she says , " getting sober is always a positive thing			2
" @entity28 makes minimal reference to her parents , not naming either and mentioning only that both were " very emotionally committed to try to figure out some way to get me better			2
" participating in her father 's campaign after completing treatment " was like the greatest thing ever , " de @entity1 says , although she does n't specify that it was the mayoral race			2
@entity99 drug policy director @entity98 issued a statement tuesday afternoon praising the @entity101 for speaking out			0
" @entity0 is giving a voice to the millions who suffer from substance use and mental health disorders , and we encourage others to join her , " he said			2
" by talking about addiction in the light of day -- and by celebrating recovery out loud -- we can help correct the misinformation and stigma that too often become obstacles for the millions of @entity114 who deserve to live healthy , productive lives , " @entity98 said			0
@entity28 decided to speak out " because people are suffering from this disease and dying from this disease every day			0
and we really ca n't do anything as a society to help those people until we start talking about it , " she says			0
" and nobody can do sobriety on their own			0
