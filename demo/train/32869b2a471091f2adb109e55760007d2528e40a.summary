-- the set - up is simple			1
a beautiful woman looks directly at a camera and does short , jokey skits about relationships , pop culture and whatever else is on her mind			2
the woman is @entity8 , a young @entity9 from @entity10			2
smiles was a struggling 20 - year - old juggling two jobs when , about a month ago , she started posting videos to @entity14 , beginning with remakes of popular @entity17 other people had created			1
now she has more than 1.9 million followers on the social - video network , has started and ended a public relationship with an equally " @entity14 - famous " guy , and has quit jobs as a makeup artist and receptionist to pursue her dream of acting full time			1
@entity14 is a mobile app from @entity30 for sharing videos that are no more than six - seconds long			1
the videos are created on smartphones and tablets using a single button to start and stop recording , and clips ca n't be imported , edited , reordered or deleted			1
even with those limitations , or possibly because of them , @entity14 has become a hit since its january debut			2
the medium has even created a vibrant online subculture and its own cast of cult stars , called " viners			1
" they are not household names like @entity49 , @entity50 or @entity51 ( though many real stars do have large @entity14 audiences )			1
but @entity14 celebrities like @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 have millions of followers			1
some say they are recognized on the street daily , with fans asking if they can get a picture with them and a signed autograph			2
@entity65 makes cute and funny vines with his kids and has half a million followers			1
the most popular comedian on @entity14 is @entity70 who has 3 million followers			1

( for reference , @entity83 's @entity82 is no. 18			0
) like @entity8 , @entity85 said he is recognized in public regularly			0
how does he explain the explosion of interest in his videos ? " i 'm just being myself and being goofy			1
i like to make my @entity17 relatable , " said @entity56			1
@entity56 has also parlayed his @entity14 celebrity into a career			0
he said he has a tv show in the works as a direct result of his @entity14 posts , and is excited to finally have the opportunity to follow his dreams of comedic acting and writing			0
@entity14 itself is not profitable , but posters with big followings can make money by plugging brands on their own channels or appearing in @entity17 for companies			1
both @entity56 and smiles are represented by a company called @entity109 , which has licensing rights to all of their @entity112 content			0
@entity56 also has appeared in @entity114 ads on that company 's @entity116 account , which were arranged by @entity118 , another @entity14 talent agency			0
" my life has completely changed			0
i 've had the most amazing opportunities and such great exposure because of @entity14 , " said @entity8			0
" none of this would have been possible without it			0
" their followers have created fan pages and imitation accounts , and the comments on their videos are typically things like , " please follow me ! ! ! i will do anything for you to notice me			1
" smiles is still adjusting to the attention			0
she said she is flattered by the knock - off accounts , though she is unsure why anyone would spend the time to do that			1
" my mom still has to remind me that i ca n't leave my house without makeup and wearing pajamas , " @entity8 said			0
" people recognize me everywhere , no matter what state i 'm visiting			0
" when @entity8 arranged to meet her then boyfriend , fellow @entity14 star @entity150 , in real life for the first time in @entity149 , they invited all their followers			1
the result was a " @entity116 , " when thousands of fans show up in person to meet a @entity14 star and then film the mass gathering to post on @entity14			0
how do normal , everyday people catch the attention of so many strangers ? what is it about this simple app that pushes people into celebrity status ? " it 's kind of an escape for a couple of minutes			0
if people are having a bad day they can go to our vines and see these people that are saying it 's ok to be goofy , " @entity56 said			0
one reason some of these @entity176 say they are growing a devout following is their relatable nature			0
the @entity17 often tackle real - life scenarios and common pet peeves			1
the top @entity176 also tend to have one thing in common : comedy			0
people connect , and even become a little obsessed , with their down - to - earth , funny personalities			2
" when people tell me that i changed their life because they were in a dark place and i helped to make them laugh -- that is the coolest thing , " @entity8 said			2
finding fame through an app is a new phenomenon unique to this generation			0
though the videos are short , standing out is no easy feat. with over 13 million active users posting on the service , how does someone become a @entity116 star ? @entity56 advises , " just be original			2
a lot of people think it just happens , but it takes a lot of time and i work hard at my vines			0
