-- there is , perhaps , no greater living symbol of the untamed , pioneer spirit of the @entity4 than the wild mustang			1
in the @entity6 of the @entity7 -- a vast , empty , desert plain that stretches across most of @entity8 and includes parts of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 -- it 's estimated that 40,000 mustangs still roam free			1
they 're regarded by many as part of the national heritage and a treasure for people the world over to enjoy			2
" they 're sensual , " says @entity22 , owner of @entity8 's new @entity23 : @entity25			1
" when you come across a wild bunch , it 's euphoria			1
" her new resort provides a sanctuary for some of these horses while also offering a deluxe stay for those interested in discovering a little more about this @entity4 icon			1
history of the @entity23 though some dispute the claim , scholars generally believe that mustangs were introduced to the @entity42 by the @entity43 in 1493 , having been brought over by @entity44 on his second voyage to the @entity46			1
when @entity47 first saw them , they called them " big dogs			0
" but soon they became an essential component of the life of @entity53 's first people and are still considered sacred by many tribes			0
in the 19th century , horses of all types , of course , played an essential role in the westward expansion and modernization of @entity53			2
future uncertain wild horses are protected under federal law			1
but protection policies are n't popular with everyone who lives and works in the @entity4			0
ranchers view mustangs as a threat to their livelihood			2
" they 're feral , " says a former mustanger -- the term used for cowboys charged with controlling their numbers			0
" without a natural predator , their presence is unsustainable and bad for the environment			0
" charged with maintaining the ecological balance of public grazing land , the federal @entity77 ( @entity77 ) has found itself in the middle of disputes related to mustangs and wild horses			1
( often used generically to describe any wild horse , " mustang " is derived from the @entity43 term " mustengo , " which means " ownerless beast " or " stray horse			2
" ) in april , according to the @entity91 , @entity90 officials in @entity10 drafted a letter to the @entity77 in effect telling the government that if it did n't remove wild horses from their land , local residents would do the job themselves			1
in june , a suit brought against the federal government by the @entity101 demanded that the @entity77 accelerate roundups of mustangs there , as reported by the @entity105			2
in @entity8 , the @entity77 agreed with ranchers that wild herds threaten the range , but also said it does n't have the resources to conduct the popular roundups			2
roundups roundups of free roaming horses destined for short term holding pens -- or worse , illegal poaching for sale to slaughterhouses -- have become regular occurrences			1
animal rights groups argue that many of these " gatherings " are unnecessarily cruel , leaving many animals wounded or dead			0
they contend that the level that has been set for a sustainable number of wild horses on the land , and reports of their negative impact on the environment , have been skewed in the favor of opposing human interest groups			1
although the @entity77 adopts a portion of roundup animals to new homes , costs for keeping them are escalating			0
in 2013 , $ 46.2 million was spent keeping roughly 50,000 wild horses in short - and long - term holding pens			1
seed of a solution @entity23 : @entity142 is a new boutique , luxury ranch that may offer a partial solution			1
the brainchild of billionaire businesswoman , philanthropist and former wife of oil tycoon @entity149 , @entity22 , the new ranch is designed to provide a sanctuary for up to a thousand wild horses and a chance for tourists to connect with this iconic symbol of @entity53			1
by eliminating expensive holding pens , @entity149 says that her ranch alone can save taxpayers as much as $ 2.5 million a year , while allowing the horses to roam free			1
@entity23 each of the resort 's 10 reclaimed wood cottages and 10 live - in teepees have been designed with luxuriously rustic interiors , double beds and artisan bric - a - brac -- if @entity166 and @entity167 were to elope @entity4 , this is where they 'd honeymoon			1
meals are served in an enormous hand - painted teepee , there 's a saloon with saddle bar stools , high - end gambling tables and a porch for cocktails with a perfect view of the grazing herd			2
" it 's good for your soul , " resident cowboy @entity180 says			0
" just to watch them run			0
" six hundred wild horses roam in a 4,000 - acre enclave at the front of the ranch			1
experienced riders can saddle up and head out with resident cowboys , @entity191 and @entity192 , for a high adrenalin gallop into the herd that feels , according to @entity180 , " like riding into thunder			0
" for others , there are gentle trots and 4x4 wild horse safaris in search of nearby free - roaming bands , old gold mining settlements and luxurious picnics in mountain valleys			1
the highlight : rattling down to a private meadow in an old wagon to serve breakfast to the herd			0
being surrounded by 600 wild , staring eyes and stamping hooves is a rare thrill			2
other guest experiences @entity215 may be the ranch 's raison d'etre , but there 's more than horses here			2
hiking , abseiling , gambling tables , lasso lessons , an in - teepee spa and more are on offer			1
former @entity225 and director of operations , @entity226 , can also take you out on a high - powered atv			0
when an ex-special forces operative insists on doing the driving , you know he 's not going skimp on screams			0
two brothers from the local @entity235 tribe are on hand to teach @entity238 crafts -- from learning how to make beaded jewelry to creating medicine wheels , dream catchers and more			0
each night there 's storytelling by the fire and performances of sacred dance and traditional falsetto singing			0
" horses are sacred to our people , " the native singers say			2
" we treat them as human beings			0
" things to do : the @entity254 the @entity254 may be @entity8 's best kept secret			0
