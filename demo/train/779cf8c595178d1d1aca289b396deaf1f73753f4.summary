@entity1 commissioner @entity0 will work with four women " on the development and implementation of the league 's policies , resources and outreach on issues of domestic violence and sexual assault , " according to a memo @entity0 sent to the league 's teams monday			1

@entity17 is expected to appeal his indefinite suspension before tuesday night 's deadline but @entity68 said that is not a sign that the union condones domestic violence			1
" it 's not mutually exclusive for a union to be disturbed by the actions of one of our members , but also vehemently protect our collective bargaining rights , " he said			2
" if the union believes that @entity17 's due process rights were violated , then we have an obligation to appeal his indefinite suspension			1
" the president of the @entity69 , @entity91 , told @entity97 's " @entity96 " it might be wise to bring in outside help for the league to make disciplinary decisions			2

@entity135 was allowed to play in the @entity137 ' sunday night game against the @entity138 , but @entity140 lt. gov. @entity139 has asked the team to suspend @entity135 after his arrest on domestic violence charges last month			1
