editor 's note : below is an excerpt from author @entity5 's new novel , " @entity6			1
" in this chapter , after weeks of procrastinating , @entity7 finally works up the nerve to ask his future father - in - law , @entity11 , for his daughter @entity13 's hand in marriage			1
@entity5 is an award - winning television producer for @entity17			1
nothing like mixing love and a battle with a crime ring of geriatric gangsters to cause some dizziness			1
( @entity17 ) -- i go to the dining room for some privacy			1
it 's now or never			1
i press the speed dial for " @entity29			1
" while the phone searches for a cell tower among the sticks , i confirm the coast is clear			1
my phone flickers between one and three bars			1
you ca n't do this with anything less than three out of five			1
the quality of the connection is crucial			1
" come again , @entity43 ? why on @entity46 's green earth would you want my dressing ? " i 've got two bars			1
holy crap ! holy crap ! holy crap ! i 'm getting married			1
i should have done this in person			1
i should have taken him to @entity56 's or bought tickets to an @entity59 's game or just asked him over lunch at @entity61			1
does n't every man secretly want a son ? " hello , " @entity11 says , bracing for a telemarketer			1
" dad ! it 's me			1
" no. " mr. day , @entity7 here			1
" no. " @entity11 , we need to talk			1
" no. " is anyone there ? " " hi , it 's @entity7 , " i say finally			1
" hello , @entity43 , " he says , still concerned i might sell him something			1
i can hear him tearing paper like he 's opening mail			1
" everything okay ? " he says suddenly			1
we arrived safely in @entity79 , " i assure him			1
" @entity13 is getting ready for dinner			2
" his daughter may have just turned thirty , but a father never wants to be reminded that his unwed daughter is on a sleepover with a boy			2
" ignorance is bliss , " " plausible deniability , " this is how a father deals with his daughter 's virginity , @entity13 tells me			1
" after dinner , it 's bingo at the @entity98 , a mug of hot cocoa , and straight to separate sleeping quarters , " i want to tell him			1
" how are things ? " i ask , scanning the reception area , working up the nerve			2
" same as they were two hours ago , " he says coolly			2
@entity11 clears his throat : " what can i do for you this evening ? " " so i wanted to call , " i say , taking a deep breath			2
" let me stop you right there			2
i do n't need an apology about before			2
just do n't let it happen again			2
i want to put this whole evening behind us			2
" " you want to put this evening behind us ? " " yes			2
" i let out a long sigh			2
" @entity46 , i 've never done this before , " i say			2
was that my inside voice or my outside voice ? calm down			2
" i wanted to call you , " my outside voice says			2
" you know @entity13 and i have a wonderful time together			2
i love her very much and i would like to ask her to marry me			1
i have such great respect for you and i would n't feel right not checking with you first			2
" it sounded better in the shower			2
a tumbleweed rolls through the dining room			0
" hello ? " i ask			0
" i appreciate that , @entity43 , " he says kindly			0
" he seems genuinely touched			0
" when did you want to do this ? " did n't i say " tonight " ? i swore i said " tonight			0
" " tonight ! " he 's appalled , his voice rising			1
" you 're proposing tonight and you 're asking me now ? " " you 're totally right			0
i was just worried about spoiling the surprise			0
" " you do n't trust me to keep a secret ? " @entity11 demands			0
" no , not at all , i trust you			0
i bet you 're the best with secrets			0
" @entity11 takes a deep breath			0
" wait , " he commands finally			0
" i lean against the dining room wall , sandwiching the cell phone between my ear and the window			0
i close my eyes , bracing for what @entity11 might say next			0
nine long hours pass in silence			0
then i hear him take three short hits of his inhaler			0
" hello ? " i ask			0
" hello ? " he asks			0
" oh , hey , you 're back			0
" " what do you mean ' i 'm back ' ? " he asks			0
" you 're back , you told me to wait			0
did n't you just go somewhere ? " " i 'm just sitting here			0
i was waiting for you to say something			0
" " i thought you wanted me to wait , " i say			0
i want you to wait to ask @entity13 to get married			0
" it 's as if @entity13 and i are back in the car and i 've narrowly missed that head - on collision			1
what is he asking me ? is he saying no ? is he saying maybe ? " if this is about money , " i prod , " i 've got savings			0
" " that 's not it at all			1
" " you think a year is too short to get engaged , " i conclude			0
" it 's been more like nine months , and that 's not it either			1
listen , " he begins			0
" i do n't want to pressure you , @entity11 , " i jump in , " but i love @entity13			1
we 're a good couple			0
i 'd be honored to be a part of your family			0
" " just wait , @entity7 , " he says , his voice shaky			0
it 's the first time he 's called me this			1
" i have my reasons and i 'll explain when i see you			0
but you need to make me two promises , son : keep this between us			0
" calling all couples : when did the light bulb go off in your head ? send your pictures and video to @entity195			0
