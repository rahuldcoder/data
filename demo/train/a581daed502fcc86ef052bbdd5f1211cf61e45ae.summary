@entity0 on wednesday night told a story about then - presidential candidate @entity2 telling automotive workers that government can help keep their plant going -- an account that @entity0 reportedly got wrong previously			1
did the @entity8 congressman get it right as he accepted the @entity11 nomination for vice president at the @entity13 ? @entity0 discussed @entity2 's february 2008 speech at the @entity16 plant in @entity17 , @entity8 -- a plant that eventually closed			1
according to @entity0 , @entity2 had said that " if our government is there to support you ... this plant will be here for another hundred years			1
" fact check : @entity26 , @entity2 and debt the statement : " when he talked about change , many people liked the sound of it , especially in @entity17 , where we were about to lose a major factory			0
a lot of guys i went to high school with worked at that @entity16 plant			1
right there at that plant , candidate @entity2 said : ' i believe that if our government is there to support you , this plant will be here for another hundred years			0
' that 's what he said in 2008			0
well , as it turned out , that plant did n't last another year			0
it is locked up and empty to this day			0
" the facts : @entity52 , some context			0
@entity0 reportedly recalled this event incorrectly just days ago , during an august 16 speech in @entity56			0
@entity0 reportedly alleged that @entity2 said he 'd " keep that plant open , " and therefore broke his promise because the plant closed			1
" that plant was shut down in 2009			0
i remember president @entity2 visiting it when he was first running , saying he 'll keep that plant open , " @entity0 said , according to the @entity61			1
" one more broken promise			0
" the @entity65 pointed out that @entity2 made no such promise in the february 13 , 2008 , speech , and indeed , we 've seen no account suggesting that @entity2 did			2
here is the quote at issue , according to an account kept by the @entity74 : " i know that @entity16 received some bad news yesterday , and i know how hard your governor has fought to keep jobs in this plant			1
but i also know how much progress you 've made -- how many hybrids and fuel - efficient vehicles you 're churning out , " @entity2 said			0
" and i believe that if our government is there to support you , and give you the assistance you need to re-tool and make this transition , that this plant will be here for another hundred years			0
" by " bad news , " @entity2 apparently was referring to @entity16 's february 12 , 2008 , announcement that it had a $ 38.7 billion adjusted net loss for 2007			1
so , back on august 16 of this year , it does appear @entity0 was wrong for saying @entity2 promised to keep it open			2
the @entity65 and the @entity61 went further , reporting that the plant halted production in december 2008 , and saying that @entity0 essentially was criticizing @entity2 for failing to save a plant that closed before @entity2 took office			1
however , while december 2008 saw the end of the vast majority of the plant 's work , the @entity61 itself has reported that the plant did n't close fully until april 2009			2
here 's a timeline : june 2008 : @entity16 announces that the @entity17 plant will stop production of medium - duty trucks by the end of 2009 , and stop production of large suvs such as the @entity114 and @entity115 and the @entity114 in 2010 or sooner , depending on market demand			1
december 23 , 2008 : @entity118 production ends , and more than 2,000 @entity16 workers are laid off , according to the @entity61			0
april 23 , 2009 : the plant 's medium - duty assembly line , which produced an @entity124 line , closes , ending vehicle production at the plant and resulting in the loss of 57 production jobs , according to the @entity61			1
@entity16 then put the plant on standby , meaning it could reactivate the facility if it decides it needs to ramp up production			2
now , compare @entity0 's wednesday night statement with the one he gave on august 16			2
on wednesday , @entity0 said nothing of @entity2 making a promise , but rather quoted him			1
the quote is truncated ( in @entity0 's prepared remarks released to the media , an ellipsis replaces the missing words , " give you the assistance you need to re-tool and make this transition " ) but essentially is correct			1
the only thing @entity0 appears to have gotten technically wrong in wednesday 's version was saying that the plant did n't last another year			2
it did last another year -- more like 14 months -- if the @entity124 line and its 57 workers count			0
so , though @entity0 might have been incorrect in the august 16 telling , he cleaned it up for wednesday 's convention			2
@entity2 said what @entity0 said he said			2
but to fairly evaluate @entity2 's statement , at least two pieces of context -- missing from @entity0 's account -- would be useful : first , that @entity2 was n't telling this plant that he 'd save it from a pending closure			1
he was n't addressing a plant that he knew to be closing , because the closure announcement did n't come until four months after his speech			0
second , although the plant 's last bit of production stopped early in @entity2 's presidency and the plant remains closed , the closure was planned before @entity2 became president			1
verdict : true , but incomplete			0
fact check : @entity0 misleads on debt panel 's spending cut plan			0

@entity0 criticizes ' 08 @entity2 quote about @entity16 plant
most of @entity8 plant 's production stopped months after statement ; all production stopped in ' 09
earlier this month , @entity0 incorrectly said @entity2 broke a promise
@entity0 cleaned up account at convention , but *important* context still missing
