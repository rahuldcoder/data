@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 was going through hard times , coping with financial woes after recently losing her job at an insurance company , all that coming years after an accident left her husband unable to work			1
yet it was something else entirely on her mind when she and her daughter came weeping into their @entity0 , @entity1 , church thursday , according to their pastor			1
" i knew it was something bad , " @entity14 senior pastor @entity18 told @entity2 on sunday			0
@entity20 told @entity18 that police came to her door the previous day , saying their visit had " something to do with the @entity27 case			1
" the 6 - year - old boy 's sudden disappearance a block from his @entity30 home on may 25 , 1979 , spawned a national movement to raise awareness of missing children , including the then - novel approach of putting an image of the child 's face on milk cartons			1
her husband , @entity20 , ended up leaving the family home with police -- and , with his subsequent arrest , he has n't returned			1
" she seemed absolutely shell - shocked , " @entity18 recalled sunday of his conversation three days earlier with @entity4			0
she had an expression on her face like , ' how could this ever happen ? ' " that same day , police commissioner @entity52 told reporters that @entity20 had admitted -- as a then - 19 - year - old clerk in a @entity30 bodega -- to luring @entity56 to the store with the promise of a soda , choking him and placing his body in the trash about a block and a half away			2
the @entity30 district attorney 's office charged @entity20 with second - degree murder , finding his confession credible even given that authorities concede there is no physical evidence linking him and that @entity73 's body has never been found			1
defense lawyer @entity74 claims his client -- who is on suicide watch at @entity78 's @entity77 , according to a law enforcement source -- has a " long psychiatric history " including schizophrenia , bipolar disorder and hallucinations			0
@entity20 has not entered a plea due to a pending psychiatric evaluation			0
@entity4 is @entity20 's second wife			1
@entity18 , the @entity1 pastor , said he got the impression @entity20 never mentioned anything about the @entity73 case or about killing anyone to his wife , while ceding he never posed the question directly to @entity4			1
what he did know for certain was that the @entity20 family attended the church regularly			2
the couple faithfully sat in the second row during services , the pastor said			0
@entity4 and her daughter were active in church ministries			2
but @entity20 , who @entity52 has said had been collecting disability payments since a 1993 accident prevented him from working , was more in the background			0
" he 's very quiet , very shy , " @entity18 said , describing him as " socially awkward			0
" the pastor said that his interactions with the husband typically consisted of brief greetings and little else			0
once , the couple came to him for counseling -- for an issue he say was not related to their marriage or a crime -- and @entity4 " did all the talking , " @entity18 said			0
for this sunday 's services , @entity4 and her daughter were not in their regular spot in the second row			2
but they were on @entity18 's mind , as was @entity20 's alleged victim and the boy 's family			2
" please pray for the @entity73 family , pray for @entity4 and ( her daughter ) , " the pastor told his congregation			1
" please pray for @entity20			0

@entity4 visited her pastor after her husband 's arrest , the pastor says
she was weeping and *confused* that @entity20 was accused of murder
police say her husband confessed to killing @entity27 , 6 , in 1979
the pastor asks church *members* to pray for the @entity73 and @entity20 families
