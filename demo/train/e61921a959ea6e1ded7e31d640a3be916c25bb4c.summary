@entity0 -- a pandemic is one of the few things with the power to stop the global economy in its tracks			2
dr. @entity7 is confident that does n't have to happen			1
after all , he was on the ground in @entity9 to see the very last case of " killer " smallpox in the world			2
after 2 - year - old @entity15 recovered following treatment , the @entity14 declared the wicked disease was over in 1980			2
" i 'm the luckiest guy in the world , " said @entity7			1
" there 's nothing better than working in a program like that and to know that something that horrible no longer exists			2
" speaking thursday at the annual @entity25 conference in @entity0 , @entity7 made the case that several key actions will stop pandemics : early detection , early response and better cooperation among governments			1
some 2,000 health professionals and thought leaders from all sectors of society are attending @entity25 at the @entity37 this week for a series of talks , which are also being televised in more than 80 countries			2
" with all of these viruses , we have to isolate them locally and put them in jail			1
it 's the only way to deal with a pandemic , " said @entity7 , now president of the @entity45			1
" early warning systems are essential to protect us from the things that are humanity 's worst nightmare			1
" " a pandemic would have not just deaths and medical consequences , but also -- social disruption			2
there would be global recession and depression			0
millions would lose their jobs			0
there would be no internet and no flights , " explains @entity7			1
" would you get on an airplane with 250 people coughing and sneezing , when you knew some of them might carry a disease that could kill you ? it would be apocalyptic			0
" @entity71 10 years on : how dogged detective work defeated an epidemic early detection is working			1
" in 1996 , it took almost half a year -- 167 days -- to discover a potential pandemic			0
by 2009 , it took only 23 days , " says @entity7			1
" the question is , how can we make that better ? if we can drive that number down to a few days , to just one incubation period , it may be 100 years before that virus has the same mutation -- maybe never			1
" early response and treatment are making a difference too			1
" viruses are much more fragile than you think , " he said			0
" @entity91 , now circulating in @entity92 , does n't go person to person -- it has to go from birds or pigs to people			0
that makes it more complicated to spread			0
so things have to go just right for a virus to become a pandemic			0
that 's why it 's important to contain it in one country			0
" just as the ease of international travel and the growth of global food supply chains help spread virulent new viruses , emerging technologies offer solutions to keep them at bay			0
" we can find cases earlier with digital detection -- web self - reporting , @entity120 , @entity121 , social networking , blogging , internet searches , online news and health reporting , " said @entity7 , who was previously executive director of @entity118			1
in that capacity , @entity7 helped develop a search system to try and beat the timeline of the official flu outbreak reports from the @entity130			1
" @entity130 reporting requires a patient to see a doctor , the doctor to gather samples and the samples to be analyzed , " explains @entity7			1
" it 's a lot faster using crowd - sourcing technology -- a cellphone or a computer that simply asks a person , ' are you healthy or sick ? ' " currently , there are dozens of nonprofit sites that track disease outbreaks in real time , including healthmap.org and instedd.org			2
" now , we really can see the flu coming and quickly know how to protect ourselves , " said @entity7			1
for decades , the @entity14 accepted information on potential outbreaks only through official channels -- via , for example , a health minister			2
in 2007 , the rules changed			0
@entity158 now flows in through government and independent reporting			0
brilliant notes that some countries are going even farther			0
through the recent launch of @entity165 , a new entity bringing together regional disease surveillance networks , 28 different countries officially cooperate , sharing information to curb epidemics before they become pandemics			2
@entity171 death toll may be 15 times higher than previously reported " we have to enlist everyone 's support , " @entity7 said			1
" we are all in this together			0
polio and guinea worm soon will be eradicated -- and i hope to see a photo finish there			0
" eighty countries came together to end smallpox -- the disease that reigned for more than two centuries , killing pharaohs and kings , is completely gone			0
today , we are finding diseases faster than anyone ever imagined			0
innovations in early detection , early response and global cooperation can put an end to pandemics			1
we are closer every day			0

@entity7 has been fighting outbreaks for more than 30 years
he says early detection , early response and better cooperation are keys to ending pandemics
" we have to isolate them locally and put them in jail , " he says
