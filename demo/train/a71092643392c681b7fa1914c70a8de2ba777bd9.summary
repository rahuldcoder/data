-- like a professional location scout for @entity4 fairy tale movies , photographer @entity1 seeks out and explores the less - traveled regions of @entity6 , searching for places that test the boundaries of fantasy and reality			1
the results are haunting photographs that look like they were smuggled out of a dream			2
" @entity16 's books , like @entity17 and @entity18 , were inspired by the old @entity20 myths , legends and fairy tales , " says @entity1			1
" the movies featured the wild landscapes of @entity25 -- but i wanted to find out if there are similar wild landscapes left in the populous region of @entity6 , too			1
therefore , i visited places in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			2
" the resulting series is called @entity35 , for which @entity1 expertly uses framing , fog and lighting to subtly suggest the fairy tales of @entity41			1
he lets our imaginations do the rest			2
beginning with @entity46 , published in 1812 , @entity4 and @entity45 collected and published folklore ; specifically the stories that they believed reflected and preserved aspects of their own germanic culture and faith			2
stories such as @entity56 , @entity57 , and @entity58 all originated in @entity20 folk tales			0
thanks to their research , these fables held enough appeal to survive the centuries			0
" as a kid i was deeply fascinated by the magic of those stories , " says @entity1			1
" now -- grown up and living in a rather big city ( @entity70 ) -- this magic has disappeared in my everyday life ... i try to restore this world in my pictures			1
" @entity1 is a geographer as well as a photographer , and he combines both disciplines to communicate more than just the scenic beauty of a landscape			1
he does a considerable amount of research both ahead of time and in the field , taking into account landscape genesis , culture , and history			0
the locations he seeks are often rural and remote , and he uses fables and local fairy tales as a source when searching for new and lesser - known photo locations in @entity6			1
once he 's finally found the right spot , the weather conditions have to match up perfectly			0
" fog is an essential ingredient for the otherworldly look i am searching for , " @entity1 says			1
" i would say i have ' mastered ' my personal ' fog forecast ' abilities , but it 's still more often than not a game of pure chance whether the fog has the right density or not			2
sometimes it lasts years until you 'll get the desired conditions			0
" @entity1 actively began pursuing photography in 2003 , starting with a compact @entity105			1
the following year , he spent his alternative service ( @entity30 's version of mandatory military service ) near the @entity109 , which took him to some amazing landscapes			2
" this was the time i started to reflect on composition and light control , " he says			0
" one year later i unfortunately dropped the @entity105 camera down a waterfall -- seems like my photographic passion for landscapes was present from the beginning			2
" the sudden loss of his only camera eventually pushed him to purchase a dslr in 2006 , but his work did n't become what he considers truly ambitious for another three years			0
while on a six - month trip in @entity125 , he became drawn to scenes that characterize what he now describes as the " melancholic and harsh beauty " of his remote surroundings			0
" in technology - driven urban environments , it 's principally hard to find resting places untouched by disturbing visual , olfactory , or audible noise , " @entity1 says			1
" these kinds of places are endangered in today 's world			0
" along with the long hikes and inclement weather , @entity1 has the added challenge of being colorblind			1
the blindness affects several tones , rendering him incapable of distinguishing green from red , magenta from grey , or violet from blue			0
rather than be detrimental to his work , over the years he 's learned to transform it into a source of strength			0
by ignoring color , he 's free to focus more on the composition , which can be difficult to tame in chaotic forest environments			0
ultimately it 's @entity1 's instincts , vision and editing that infuse his photos with fantasy and elevate them above simply beautiful landscapes			1
" i do n't want to show just portrayals of natural scenes , " @entity1 says			1
" i want to create visually accessible places where the visitor can put his mind at rest and make up his own stories			0
