-- three years ago , scenes of the @entity2 broadcast across the globe showed women who appeared to be equal participants in the revolutions and their aftermath			1
these images of women taking such public positions -- from @entity11 to @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 -- took much of the world by surprise			2
despite the stereotype of them as an oppressed group , @entity17 women have a long history of participating in the region 's upheavals , dating back at least to the anti-colonial movement when women emerged from the confinement of the household to take up crucial organizational positions			1
today , as the world grapples with this challenging and tumultuous moment in the region , it is important to pay close attention to the voices of @entity17 women and their plight			1
but rather than confining the story of women to an issue of religion or culture , it is important that the world uses what is happening to them as a barometer of the trajectory that individual societies are on			1
after all , how a country or a region treats its women in many ways tells the story of the future political direction of that country			2
the trouble is that this trajectory is in too many cases not particularly encouraging			0
in the @entity2 's aftermath , there have been plans to lower the legal marriage age , support expressed for polygamy after years of being regulated , restrictions on women 's mobility and political participation , a massive increase in sexual harassment and assault on the streets with police failing to intervene , and the use of virginity tests on women arrested for participating in a demonstration , as seen in @entity12			1
but young women now are not willing to back away from their demands , and they are speaking out in spite of public harassment			0
and while many women have been beaten and imprisoned for making their voices heard , they have crossed what is often described as the line of fear			0
in doing so , their message to the older generation of feminists is that the rights of women must be included in the civil rights discussion of societies more broadly			0
the hope is that the voice of women might also have more influence on the direction of policy in the region , perhaps offering a path that encourages calm in a part of the world too often wracked by violence			2
ultimately , what young women in the @entity105 are saying is that they are seeking out a new form of identity , one that is inclusive of both their religious identity and their desire for civil liberties			0
it is with this view in mind that my partners @entity117 , @entity118 and i announced our commitment at the @entity121 2014 to launch " the @entity122 , " a multimedia initiative that focuses on the voices of @entity17 women , their plight and their dreams for the future			1
the world can no longer treat women 's issues as if they are somehow separate from everything that goes on in , and defines , a country or region			1
indeed , women should be seen as the bellwether for the direction of society at large -- where women thrive , so do opportunities for all			2
where women are oppressed , oppression of all dissenting voices typically goes hand in hand			0
above all though , women 's issues should not be discussed as if they are somehow relevant only at the margins of a society			1
instead , they should be considered front and center , and an international priority			0
and the first step toward making them such a priority is listening to what they have to say in the first place .			0
