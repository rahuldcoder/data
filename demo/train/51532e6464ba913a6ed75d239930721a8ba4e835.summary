@entity0 , @entity1 -- residents of northern @entity1 streamed south from their earthquake - stricken hometowns saturday , crowding stores in search of vital supplies as rescue teams worked north toward the historic quake 's epicenter			1
roads and buildings showed cracks as far away as 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) from @entity15 , the closest city to the epicenter			0
one man told @entity2 the scene in towns hit by the quake and the resulting tsunami was " unimaginable			2
" shoppers were polite but tense as they sought food , water and gasoline from stores , where shelves were quickly emptied and pumps soon ran dry			1
a slow , steady line of cars trickled south from the disaster zone as people either left the area or shuttled to the stores , many of which were without power and had broken glass scattered down the aisles			1
@entity1 's major highways , large sections of which are elevated , have been closed since the magnitude 8.9 - quake struck off the northeastern coast friday afternoon			1
automobile traffic crawled on smaller , two - lane roads as power outages left the sleek , electric - powered " bullet trains " -- shining examples of @entity1 's advanced technology , usually capable of speeds nearing 200 mph -- sitting motionless on their tracks			1
closer to the heart of the disaster , collapsed phone lines and towers left communications spotty			0
roads and airfields were washed out by the tsunami ; rescue workers headed to the stricken region had to rely on helicopters			0
video from @entity15 showed people trapped in the second floors of homes , waving sheets of white cloth in hopes of drawing rescue workers			0
residents who have been able to call out reported gas and water were unavailable for a radius well beyond the city of about 1 million			2
in @entity76 , a city about 90 kilometers ( 56 miles ) south of @entity15 , all that was left of many structures were their foundations			0
only concrete and steel buildings appeared to have withstood the wash			0
no people were visible in the streets of the town , whose population on friday had been 70,000			0
the quake and resulting tsunami left behind hundreds dead by early saturday , and that number was expected to climb sharply			2
@entity88 , about 370 kilometers ( 230 miles ) from the epicenter , was spared major damage from the quake			1
but power outages and highway closures paralyzed the city as its transit network was shut down			1
commuters who usually pack the city 's subways and suburban trains in the city of 13 million tried to flag down taxis , hitch rides or walk home			1
the roads leading out of @entity88 were clogged by traffic jams that trapped some drivers for up to six hours			2
@entity2 's @entity106 contributed to this report .			0

stocks of food , water and gasoline are running thin in the quake zone
power outages idle @entity1 's sleek " bullet trains "
