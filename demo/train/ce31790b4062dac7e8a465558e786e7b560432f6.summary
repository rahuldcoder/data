@entity0 -- president @entity2 on sunday praised the " historic " @entity4 vote to pass a bill overhauling the nation 's ailing health care system , and said now it is time for the @entity9 to " take the baton " and complete its work			1
the @entity4 passed its health care bill late saturday night by a 220 - 215 vote , with 39 democrats in opposition and one @entity16 supporting it			1
@entity9 approval is considered less certain due to opposition by all @entity16 and some moderate @entity14			1
@entity2 called the support by many @entity4 members " courageous " in the face of what he called " the heated and often misleading rhetoric around this legislation			1
" the overhaul legislation would be the biggest expansion of health care coverage since @entity28 was created more than 40 years ago			1
the @entity29 , or @entity29 , restricts insurance companies from denying coverage to anyone with a pre-existing condition or charging higher premiums based on gender or medical history			0
it also provides federal subsidies to those who can not afford health insurance			2
and it guarantees coverage for 96 percent of @entity43 , according to the nonpartisan @entity44			0
senate majority leader @entity45 of @entity46 last week indicated uncertainty over whether that will happen this year			0
@entity2 said sunday morning at the @entity4 that he was " absolutely confident " the @entity9 will follow suit in passing its version of the bill			1
once both chambers have passed a bill , a congressional conference committee will merge the two proposals into a consensus version that would require final approval from each chamber and @entity2 's signature			1
however , @entity16 and an independent senator who sits with the @entity14 caucus signaled sunday that difficulties remain for @entity2 on his top domestic priority			2
sen. @entity64 , an independent from @entity65 , reiterated he would join a @entity16 filibuster against a health care bill if it contains a government - run public health insurance option following the chamber 's amendment process			1
speaking on " @entity72 , " @entity64 called the controversial public option , which is in the @entity4 bill and the @entity9 version being prepared by @entity45 , an unnecessary provision intended to bring government - run health insurance in the future			1
" if the public option is in there , as a matter of conscience , i will not allow the bill to come to a final vote , " @entity64 said			1
he previously has said he wo n't oppose opening @entity9 debate on the bill despite the public option provision , and he maintained that stance sunday			1
@entity64 's stance is crucial because the @entity14 caucus has the minimum 60 votes to overcome a @entity16 filibuster			1
@entity9 @entity16 unanimously oppose the public option , though sen. @entity93 of @entity94 has floated the possible compromise idea of a trigger mechanism that would mandate a public option in the future if thresholds for expanded coverage and lower costs go unmet			1
the lone @entity4 @entity16 who supported the bill , rep. @entity104 , told @entity1 on sunday he put the needs of his district over the desire of his party			1
@entity104 's " yes " vote ended up being unnecessary for @entity4 passage , but gave house speaker @entity113 license to tout bipartisan support for the controversial measure			1
" i felt last night 's decision was the proper decision for my district even though it was not the popular decision for my party , " said @entity104 , a first - term representative from @entity117 's traditionally @entity14 2nd district			0
" a lot of my constituents are uninsured , a lot of them are poor			0
it was the right decision for the people of my district			0
" @entity104 acknowledged he extracted some @entity4 pledges to help his district deal with the continuing impact of @entity130 in exchange for his vote			2
asked about the reaction of fellow @entity16 , @entity104 said the party 's leaders " respect my decision , and i respect theirs			2
" also sunday , rep. @entity138 of @entity139 , the chamber 's third - ranking @entity16 , said on the @entity72 program that @entity14 were ignoring the wishes of the @entity43 public by pushing through the huge health care bill			1
@entity138 claimed the health care bill would raise costs , increase the deficit and lead to a government takeover of the health care system			1
" i think the @entity43 people are deeply frustrated with the liberal establishment in @entity0 , " @entity138 said			0
" if @entity14 keep ignoring the @entity43 people , their party 's going to be history			0
" @entity14 rep. @entity154 of @entity155 responded on the same show that the non-partisan @entity44 reported the @entity4 bill would reduce the deficit			2
@entity154 chided @entity16 for failing to confront rising health care costs that harmed the @entity43 economy during the years the @entity16 controlled the @entity4 and @entity161			1
" we 've had a great system for insurance companies , " @entity154 said , citing large industry profits while @entity43 face practices he called unfair , such as having coverage denied for pre-existing conditions			0
" this is a message to the @entity43 people ; we 're trying to bring down your costs to help more americans afford health insurance			0
" the @entity4 vote less than an hour before midnight saturday was full of drama			2
with eight seconds left in the voting period , @entity14 began counting down and erupted in roars when @entity113 declared , " the bill is passed " and banged the gavel			0
read the @entity4 bill ( @entity180 ) @entity16 lawmakers stood silently across the floor , some with their arms folded across their chests			1
" well , it was about what i thought it would be , " said @entity187 @entity186 of @entity188 as he quickly exited			0
later , he issued a statement saying the $ 1.2 trillion legislation would add to the country 's " skyrocketing " debt			1
" i came here to renew the @entity197 , so my kids and their kids have the same opportunities i had , " @entity186 said			0
" i came here to fight big - government monstrosities like this bill that dim the light of freedom and diminish opportunity for future generations			0
" @entity208 , the chairman of the @entity209 , also released a statement			0
" @entity113 and her liberal lieutenants made a lot of promises today to get the votes they desperately needed , " he said			0
" make no mistake -- the @entity219 leadership 's assurances were based on political expediency , not principle			0
anyone receiving a promise from @entity113 is guaranteed to be disappointed in the end when their votes are no longer needed			0
" earlier in the day , @entity2 met behind closed doors with @entity14 to shore up support for the bill , calling it the chance of a generation			2
in the run - up to the vote , @entity16 and conservative @entity14 joined forces to pass an amendment to the bill to prohibit federal funds for abortion services			2
it was considered a big win for them and for the @entity241 , which used its power -- especially with conservative democrats in swing congressional districts -- to help force @entity14 leaders to permit a vote on the amendment			0
the prohibition , introduced by @entity14 members , including rep. @entity251 of @entity139 and rep. @entity252 of @entity253 , would exclude cases of rape , incest or if the mother 's life is in danger			2
the @entity16 accounted for 174 of the votes in favor of the amendment , with one @entity16 voting " present			2
" on the @entity14 ' side , 64 voted for the measure , and 194 voted against			0
@entity1 's @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .			0

health care debate moves to @entity9 , which will vote on its version
@entity64 says he *'ll* join filibuster against bill if it includes " public option "
@entity16 decry bill 's passage , saying it will add to country 's *mounting* debt
