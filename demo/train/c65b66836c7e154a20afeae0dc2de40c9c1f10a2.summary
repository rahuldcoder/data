@entity0 -- after focusing on " green cars " in recent years , carmakers are wowing visitors at the @entity6 2012 car show with vehicles that are big , bad and gas - guzzling			1
" i would definitely be interested if the price was right , " says @entity9 as he ogled a deep purple @entity10			0
@entity10 launched its @entity14 - only limited edition this week			2
with gold dragon emblems embroidered onto its leather seats , the car also carries a hefty price tag - more than 5 million yuan ( nearly $ 800,000 )			2
@entity19 also launched a @entity6 - inspired car -- a flashy @entity22 concept car emblazoned with a long silvery dragon across the hood			1
" jeep brand sales in @entity6 in 2011 increased 81 % over the prior year and @entity6 , " said @entity25 , ceo of @entity26 , @entity27 group , at the unveiling on monday			1
" last year , more @entity19 vehicles were sold in @entity6 than in any other country besides the @entity32 and @entity33			1
" @entity25 said because the brand is committed to @entity6 , it 's important to design and tailor vehicles specifically to @entity38 tastes			1
but some consumers , like @entity9 , disagreed			0
" just because it has a dragon on it , does n't mean @entity38 people will love it			2
after all , we 're after going after a western brand , " said @entity9			0
" i like the subtlety of @entity10 's dragon design , but to put a huge dragon across the entire car is going overboard			0
" @entity19 and @entity10 are among many foreign automakers hoping to woo hundreds of thousands of @entity38 consumers visiting the show this week , especially as @entity6 has become the world 's largest auto market amid a sales slump in @entity57 and tepid growth in the @entity32			1
despite the push in green cars in previous years following government subsidies for cleaner vehicles , this year 's focus turned to gas - guzzling suvs			1
crowds swooned over the new @entity67 concept car -- a potential competitor to the popular @entity69			0
@entity70 also unveiled three suvs at the show , including the @entity73 , which is expected to be manufactured at the company 's @entity6 factory in @entity76			2
" suvs are a strength for @entity70 globally and here in @entity6 , the suv segment is one of the fastest growing segments in the industry , " said @entity77 , president of @entity70 's @entity78 and @entity80 region			2
" so you put the two together ... it 's a very exciting time			0
" automakers have turned their attention to bigger cars and flashier cars to attract consumers since there are fewer government - backed incentives to pursue green technology , analysts say			1
" it costs automakers about the same to manufacture a hybrid versus an suv — so it 's not profitable for them to pursue green cars given the market development for @entity81 right now , " said @entity100 , an analyst at @entity101 , based in @entity0			1
" if you take into account @entity6 's widening wealth - poverty gap — it 's a huge factor in luxury automakers in business			1
" @entity38 auto sales -- which surged to 35 % in 2010 -- showed signs of cooling in the first quarter of this year with just 2 % growth			1
for high - end automakers like @entity120 , their bet on the @entity6 — their largest market — remains optimistic			1
" it is really hard to predict growth rates , because when you look back nobody could have predicted the growth rates we 've seen over the last couple of years , " said @entity129 , ceo of @entity130 " since last year , we 've seen growth rates of 50 to 60 % , something i would definitely would not expect this year , but there 's definitely sustainable growth to come			0
" but analysts like @entity100 say with the demand , also comes pollution and infrastructure challenges			0
" experts here still say that @entity6 falls behind on the number of drivers it could have — whereas there are on average 140 drivers for 1,000 people in the world , @entity6 only has about 50 for every 1,000 , " said @entity100			2
" but they do n't take into consideration population density and infrastructure challenges			0
" but for drivers like @entity100 , who says he can only afford a local brand now but may upgrade to an @entity153 in the near future , owning car is about convenience and comfort			0
" i do n't know many drivers who would be concerned about creating more pollution , " said @entity100 , a 26 - year - old law student			0
" we just want travel in comfort and get to our destination on time			0

big , bad and gas - guzzling vehicles are center stage at @entity6 2012
comes after recent @entity0 car shows dominated by " green " cars
luxury car makers have launched a *variety* of vehicles aimed at @entity38 consumers
@entity38 car sales grew only 2 % the first quarter of 2012
