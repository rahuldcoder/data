in the wake of @entity3 's death , much of the talk has already turned to his political views			1
in the wake of a tragedy , it is understandable to ask why this happened			0
it is appropriate to discuss ways to keep it from happening again			0
but we should draw the line at suddenly giving an exalted place in our national discourse to the political rantings of a murderer			1
before he met his end , @entity3 took the lives of several human beings and wounded a few more			2
one of those killed was a father of two			0
the law enforcement officers killed were simply doing their jobs , trying to keep us safe			0
@entity27 county sheriff : ' this investigation is over ' today , with the families of the dead still grieving , it is very hard for me to shift away to focus on @entity3 's political views			1
the families of the victims are still in shock and mourning			2
think of their friends and relatives , who are still shocked and devastated			0
how much would it hurt them if they turned on the tv and heard , instead of tributes to those lost , pundits going on about a crazy man 's @entity48 manifesto ? we should not be " using this occasion " to debate various theories of racial justice -- not while the blood of the innocent is still fresh on the ground			1
@entity3 's actions have invalidated his notions of justice ; killing innocent people is not the proper method to advance the cause of justice , period			1
furthermore , why should any of us participate in giving @entity3 exactly what he wanted ? we should not validate his quest for attention by discussing his political thinking , especially not while mourning families are planning funerals			1
ex-lapd cop gains sympathizers on social media @entity3 might have raised intriguing questions on the way to his insane conclusion			2
but real insights are available elsewhere , from sources that are infinitely more credible			0
there are many better spokespeople for the cause of racial justice than @entity3			1
in @entity84 , there are hundreds of people who have been working to reform the @entity87 through legal means , without harming anyone			0
the people who deserve to be talked about today are the victims of this violence and the people who are trying to make positive change in peaceful , lawful ways			2
i do n't want to reference @entity3 in any way except for what he was -- someone who was very disturbed , who needed mental health support and who cruelly took the lives of those devoted to service .			0
