" newspaper , the " @entity28 , " is their latest tool			2

@entity0 one year on : how the revolution has changed our lives " most @entity0 media lost its neutrality , " he said			1
" we are a different but true voice that reveals the truth about the january 25 ' crisis			0
' " ( it ) has brought nothing but hundreds of kidnappings , more poverty , robberies , incredible loss in tourism and crimes we never imagined			0
" economic concerns are high in many @entity0 ' minds : damage to the tourism industry has been estimated at up to $ 1 billion and the country 's net international reserves have fallen by 50 % , according to @entity74			1

the six partners funding the paper , he says , are professional engineers , doctors , and businessmen who have one conviction in mind -- to preserve @entity0 and retrieve @entity4 's dignity			1
" the former president -- a veteran of four wars and commander of the @entity112 in the 1973 war with @entity114 -- can not be degraded in court like that , " said @entity42			0

" @entity4 's lawyer , @entity120 , advocates his client 's innocence and has capitalized on the former president 's honorable military career urging for him to be referred to a military court			1
last week , @entity120 asserted that @entity4 was still technically president since he " gave up " the presidency orally without signing a written document as entailed in the constitution			1
a media war erupted and dozens of @entity0 tv stations , classified by their political direction as pro or anti-revolution , analyzed the lawyer 's claims according to their political bias			1
in this confusing media and political landscape , many @entity0 have reverted to humor as a way of coping			1

opinion : what do @entity0 's generals want ? the majority of the population does not share the views in the " @entity28 , " according to dr. @entity174 , @entity175 at @entity176			2
" the people publishing this paper distribute it for free knowing that the majority of the population are against their views			0
" but their tactical approach may win them some of the poor susceptible people caught in the falling economic blunder @entity0 is living today			0
" @entity174 says the revolution in @entity0 is an ongoing process that has not been completed			1
people are confused and polarized amid the anarchy following the removal of the deeply - rooted system that came with the @entity4 era , he adds			1

@entity201 , a hard - line protester who participated in the uprising that ousted @entity4 took a glance at the paper before lashing out at the ruling @entity14			2
" if the @entity14 is really the protector of this revolution and celebrating its anniversary on january 25 , proclaiming a national day , then why are they allowing this paper , " @entity201 asked			0
" would the @entity210 or @entity211 after their heroic revolutions allow such a paper glorifying their toppled dictators such as the deceased @entity215 or that fugitive @entity216 ? "			0
