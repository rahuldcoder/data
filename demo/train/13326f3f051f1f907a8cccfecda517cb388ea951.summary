-- 2010 began with promise for advocates of immigration reform , but it ended with a stark reminder of the obstacles they face			0
in the two weeks since a @entity8 filibuster killed the @entity9 ( it stands for @entity9 ) , commentators and political strategists have already shifted their focus to the next @entity13 , where any legislation including legalization of undocumented people is unlikely			1
to chart a path for the future , however , it 's useful to take stock of what @entity9 's failure reveals about the bill 's opponents			1
in letting this piece of legislation die , 45 senators allowed restrictionist sentiments to prevail over economic rationality and showed why it is so hard to have a sensible national conversation about immigration			2
( it wo n't help them much with the @entity35 electorate either			1
) in actual fact , considering immigration through an economic lens makes sense these days , as @entity40 and their political leaders grapple with an economy climbing out of crisis			1
it should have been a no - brainer for @entity13 to promote the development of skilled workers and encourage them to stay here			0
instead , they killed the bill that directly confronted what to do with the immigrant potential we already have within our borders			0
@entity9 was not about the relative merits of bringing in new immigrants -- an important question for another day			1
the most recent version of @entity9 offered a way to bring roughly 1 million motivated high school graduates into our formal economy			1
conditional upon completing two years of university or military service , undocumented immigrants brought here by their parents as minors would be offered an earned path to citizenship			0
the students would have been able to go to college , serve in the military , and go on to use their education and talents to contribute to our economy and national security			0
@entity9 was based on the simple premise that we do not punish children for the actions of their parents			1
but allow me , for the moment , to set aside the critical questions of justice , inclusion , and compassion and focus instead on the economic question			2
@entity9 students have been educated in this country for up to 12 years , and the vast majority of them want to go on to college			2
in fact , tens of thousands of " @entity9 " have already completed at least an associate 's degree			1
by voting against @entity9 , the @entity95 -- 39 republicans and 6 @entity97 -- who either abstained or voted against limiting @entity8 debate effectively told those immigrants to either remain in the shadows or take their education , motivation , and ingenuity elsewhere			2
the senators revealed a willingness to squander the investment our country has already made on these young people			0
the economic effects are quantifiable			0
@entity112 , on the budget : the nonpartisan @entity114 calculated that passage of @entity9 would have reduced the government deficit over the next 10 years by $ 2.2 billion because @entity9 would contribute more in taxes and social security payments			2
meanwhile the longer - term implications for the deficit are less clear , but the @entity9 's principal economic benefit would have gone beyond public revenues and spending			1
as @entity9 participants attended college and either joined the workforce or continued studying , they would have helped fill our impending labor shortages of nurses , teachers , and computer technicians			2
no wonder , then , that a recent @entity134 analysis found that granting @entity9 legal status would generate at least $ 1 trillion in income for the @entity40 economy over their working lives			1
even the conservative @entity140 -- which supported the @entity9 -- sees the economic benefits of legalizing immigrants like those eligible for @entity9			1
@entity147 , like outspoken leaders of many @entity146 companies , knows that the baby boomers will soon retire and that our increasingly service - based economy needs more young skilled workers here at home			0
by sending educated young people away we would be doing the opposite of what sensible governments strive for : keeping the skilled labor that all economists identify as critical for economic growth			0
meanwhile , allowing them to stay , complete their education , and join the workforce would bolster segments of our economy for which we will soon lack enough qualified workers			0
but virtually all @entity96 and a few conservative democrats in the @entity8 refused to heed this simple economic argument			0
the bill 's death - by - filibuster marked the low point for an outgoing @entity8 that has pandered with nothing but short - sighted enforcement policies			0
the big question , now , is whether @entity96 leaders in the new @entity13 will recognize the need to shift from their current suicide path of alienating @entity35 voters			1
here , the role of conservative advocates of comprehensive immigration reform could be critical			0
conservative religious groups , some of whom have begun advocating policy that would show compassion and respect for what they called the " @entity191 - given " dignity of immigrants , could be a powerful voice in advancing the moral case for reform			1
meanwhile , business leaders must further amplify their message about the need for immigrant labor and a sensible system to legalize and regulate it			0
these two groups would face steep odds in achieving any pro-immigrant legislation in the next two years , but they could begin the important work of bringing shared values and common sense back to this debate -- and setting the stage for the @entity9 's next act			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			2

@entity212 says it helps to look at what @entity9 's failure says about its opponents
opponents ignored evidence , he says , that act would have been big economic plus for @entity40
that 's *irresponsible* for economy , he says , and will also hurt them with @entity35 voters
*writer* : business , religious groups that back @entity9 must help set stage for next act
