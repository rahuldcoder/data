-- in late may 2011 , @entity1 made his first campaign jaunt to @entity3 , a primary state that bedeviled him during his first presidential campaign and would prove just as vexing in his second			2
@entity1 's difficulties with the conservative base are now well - documented			2
but among his many problems on the right , immigration was n't one of them			0
on that may afternoon in @entity3 , @entity1 , his sleeves rolled up and shirt tucked neatly into bluejeans , came prepared to answer a range of tough questions			0
he delivered a defense of his health care law and equivocated on a controversial @entity23 plan being debated in @entity24			0
he did n't expect to have to talk about immigration , but one activist who felt like a party crasher in the small , hand - picked audience wanted to know if @entity1 backed amnesty for " illegals			0
" @entity1 said no , matter - of - factly outlined his positions , and the voter departed seeming satisfied			0
the point is this : even if immigration fails to register as a top issue in the polls -- only 3 % of @entity38 called it the country 's " most important problem " in a recent @entity48 survey -- the topic continues to burn white hot as a litmus test among a passionate and vocal slice of the @entity44 primary electorate			1
opinion : big surprise ahead on immigration even when immigration reform is not on the calendar in @entity24 -- and it was n't during the 2012 campaign -- it routinely bubbles up in @entity44 primary campaigns , popping up in town hall meetings , on talk radio and online			1
and it 's not just the dreaded " comprehensive " immigration reform effort that roils grassroots activists ; for a defiant portion of the @entity44 base ( looking at you , @entity66 ) , any kind of reform is non-negotiable			1
despite efforts by top @entity44 in @entity68 to improve the party 's miserable image among @entity72 voters , not much has changed since the 2012 primary campaign , when @entity44 voters tore down @entity76 gov. @entity75 for telling a debate audience that they did n't " have a heart " if they opposed in - state college tuition for young illegal immigrants			1
undocumented immigrant lawyer speaks out a sweeping @entity83 immigration bill is stalled in the @entity84 , effectively dead and nailed into its coffin by its own @entity44 co-sponsor , sen. @entity87 , who now opposes it			1
house speaker @entity89 says he is open to passing a series of smaller fixes			0
at the same time , numerous elected @entity44 officials made intemperate comments about @entity72 immigrants			2
this is the party that @entity97 gov. @entity96 , who will ceremonially sign a @entity97 version of the @entity99 this week , must face if he decides to seek the @entity44 presidential nomination in 2016			1
and at first glance , his support for the bill , which allows undocumented immigrants who have attended @entity97 high schools for three years to pay in - state college tuition rates , is problematic			1
@entity96 reaches immigration deal with @entity97 democrats having won re-election last november with a majority of @entity72 voters , @entity96 's support for the so - called tuition equality bill is another notch in his belt as he cultivates an image as a @entity44 who can appeal to independent voters and nontraditional constituencies			1
he is , his supporters believe , a @entity44 candidate who can actually win a national election			2
but in the hothouse context of a @entity44 primary , which he must win to get to a national election , signing the tuition bill seems like yet another example of @entity96 unfurling a giant middle finger to the very voters whose support he will need once the presidential race begins in earnest this november			1
the biggest sin conservatives point to when discussing @entity96 is symbolic : his arm - in - arm tour of the @entity97 coastline with president @entity139 after @entity140 , lending the president a veneer of bipartisan street cred just days before the 2012 presidential election			1
there are other apostasies : gun control measures signed in @entity147 , a gushing buddy - buddy appearance with @entity149 at a policy conference in @entity151 last summer , and his spirited defense of the country 's surveillance and drone efforts , a position that rankles libertarians			2
@entity158 , a 23 - year - old student at the @entity160 - founded @entity159 in @entity161 , summed up the prevailing conservative attitude toward @entity96 at last summer 's @entity164 conference in @entity68			1
" he is not very popular here , " @entity158 said			0
" nobody is excited to support him at all			0
nobody that i know of			0
" talk to any strategist backing his potential @entity44 opponents , and you 'll hear a similar take on @entity96 's decision to sign the @entity99 : supporting tuition breaks for illegal immigrants burnishes his reputation with the @entity179 corridor pundit class , but it cements @entity96 's status as persona non grata at the @entity182 of western @entity183 and diners of @entity185			1
" this amnesty bill is just another in a really , really long list of reasons why @entity44 primary voters do n't trust @entity96 , " said a national @entity44 operative working for a likely 2016 rival			1
" from guns , to @entity140 spending , to hugging @entity139 , he 'll have a tough time winning any early state primaries			0
unless , of course , ' @entity197 ' holds an early state @entity44 primary that i 'm unaware of			1
" but there 's another way to look at it : the conservatives who despise @entity96 for signing the tuition bill probably would n't support him anyway			2
they might not like him , but he does n't need them , either let those conservatives flock to @entity209 and @entity210 and @entity211			0
the silent plurality of @entity44 primary voters -- the blue hairs , the country clubbers , the @entity215 -- do n't garner the kind of media attention ginned up by tea party groups and outspoken pastors , but they vote			1
after all , @entity1 , that squishy scion of the hated " establishment , " lost the @entity183 caucuses by only 34 votes			0
and whatever failings @entity96 may have , few dispute that he has natural political talents and a rapport with voters that @entity1 never had			2
@entity228 says @entity89 will compromise on immigration reform the dynamics of the 2012 race were different than they will be in 2016 ; a fiscal conservative like @entity234 gov. @entity233 could clog @entity96 's lane in the business community			1
but early state operatives sympathetic to @entity96 are hopeful that there will be even more space in 2016 for a candidate who wants the party to expand its popular appeal			1
@entity243 , a @entity44 operative in @entity183 and former adviser to gov. @entity245 , pointed out that the @entity84 passed a version of the @entity99 way back in 2004			1
( the bill , however , did not become law			0
) " led by a @entity44 majority , the @entity84 unanimously passed the @entity99 in 2004 , " @entity243 said in an e-mail			1
" @entity183 has been ahead of the curve on this issue , and @entity44 value fairness			0
while there will be a vocal minority speaking out against immigration reform , a majority of @entity44 and caucus - goers will not take issue with gov. @entity96 's position on the @entity99 , and in growing circles it will gain him support			1
" and for those without long memories , one only needs to look back to 2008 to find a @entity44 candidate who bucked the party faithful on a range of issues , including immigration , and won the presidential nomination			1
@entity272 ran for president while the immigration overhaul he backed was collapsing in @entity24			0
his campaign fell apart in the process , but @entity272 recovered and mounted a remarkable comeback , facing questions about immigration all the while			0
in a crowded @entity44 field , he even won @entity3 , that conservative bastion , by courting the party establishment and cobbling together a coalition of coastal newcomers , moderate suburbanites and national security hawks in a state loaded with military families and veterans			2
ever since the @entity294 wipeout of 1964 , no @entity44 candidate has won the @entity44 nomination without having at least one foot planted firmly on the establishment side of the party divide			2
this is the bet @entity96 is making , so do n't expect him to back away from signing the tuition bill , or any of piece of legislation , once he makes his barely concealed presidential campaign official			0
as long as @entity96 is up front about where he stands , his positions may not hurt him as much as the right claims , said @entity312 , a longtime @entity44 operative in @entity3			1
" it 's running over a political speed bump , not into a brick wall , " @entity312 said of @entity96 's support for the tuition bill			2
" he 's got to do what he thinks is right and not apologize for it			0
" " now is as good a time as any to get it out of the way , " @entity312 said			0
" it 's kind of like that fight you 've got to have with your bother over that lawnmower he wrecked			0
do n't put it off all summer			0
it 's better for the @entity331 table			0
@entity3 @entity44 voters have forgiven and forgotten much more			2

immigration reform remains a litmus test among @entity44 primary voters
possible 2016 candidate @entity96 will sign @entity97 's version of the @entity99
@entity340 allows undocumented immigrants who attended high school to pay in - state rate
@entity44 operative says as long as @entity96 is up front about his position , it might not hurt him
