-- june 3 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 , @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity15 , @entity16 : our penultimate program of the school year includes a mission to @entity21 that will never get off the ground			1
the explanation 's coming up			1
you 're tuned in to @entity0 ! first up : oil spill disaster @entity27 : first up , @entity29 officials are hoping to get to the " cap " part of the " cut and cap " plan today			1
this is the latest attempt to try to fix the leaking oil well in the @entity36			2
before they can put the cap in place , they needed to cut part of the well so that they have a smooth surface to put the cap on			2
yesterday , the " cut " part of the plan hit a snag : the blade got stuck in one of the pipes			2
this video came in later in the day			2
you see that yellow thing that looks kind of like a box ? that 's the blade			1
and the fact that it 's moving around is a good thing ; it means the blade got unstuck			1
@entity29 expected to start cutting again sometime yesterday			2
meanwhile , some of the oil is washing onto shore in more places			2
these balls of tar and patches of oil started showing up on beaches in @entity69 and @entity70 yesterday			2
forecasters say that shifts in the weather could affect where the oil that 's out in the @entity36 is going			1
@entity75 has more on that			2
@entity77 , @entity78 : the weather pattern is in fact shifting			2
high pressure is now in control in the @entity36			2
this reduces the threat of hurricanes , but it also moves the wind to be in this direction			2
the direction that the people here , all the way back from let 's say @entity93 all the way back -- which is just a rich oyster bed right through there -- all the way back along @entity98 , in through @entity99 and all these areas that people know of these white sand beaches			1
that 's where the water is going to be pushed next because of this high pressure that 's just not going to move for many , many days			1
@entity108 @entity109 , @entity16 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm an @entity112 country that was founded more than 2,500 years ago			2
i 'm made up of thousands of islands , and i 'm home to more than 126 million people			2
my capital city is @entity119			2
i 'm @entity4 , and my government is run by a prime minister			1
resignation announcement @entity27 : well , right now , @entity4 is looking for a new prime minister			1
@entity124 , who took over the job less than a year ago , is now stepping down			2
in @entity4 's government , the prime minister comes from the party that has the most people in parliament			1
another member of @entity124 's party will take over for now			1
the next parliamentary elections are scheduled for july			2
having your country 's leader resign after such a short time in office might seem a little strange to us			1
but in @entity4 , it 's not that unusual			1
at least , not recently			2
@entity140 explains what we mean and examines @entity124 's path from candidate to former prime minister			1
( begin video ) @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity119 : @entity124 lead a political upheaval			2
@entity4 's voters , sick of political business as usual , were reinvigorated by @entity124 's @entity153 - style message of change last fall , ousting a ruling party that held control for almost 50 continuous years			1
@entity4 's new prime minister and his party , the @entity158 , pledged major government reform and economic recovery			1
but the euphoria did n't last long			2
the world 's second largest economy continued to struggle , weighed down by deflation and a ballooning national debt			1
then this anger from @entity167 : candidate @entity124 promised to move a @entity169 base off the island			2
prime minister @entity124 could n't keep that promise , as he came under pressure from the @entity173 the issue overshadowed @entity124 's entire agenda and helped drive his approval ratings into the teens			1
@entity124 is @entity4 's fourth prime minister in less than four years			1
@entity179 resigned exactly one year after he took the job			2
@entity181 did n't quite make it a year			2
neither did the next prime minister , @entity184			1
and now , @entity124 , on the job months short of a year			0
as @entity4 faces critical economic challenges and the fastest aging population , it must once again put those issues aside and once again focus on finding yet another leader			1
( @entity191 ) peace meeting @entity27 : moving to @entity6 , where a gun battle broke out outside of a peace conference			0
@entity6 president @entity195 was leading the event			0
he was speaking when rockets and explosives started going off outside			0
incredibly , he finished his speech ! but he left immediately afterward			0
the @entity200 , the militant organization that used to control @entity6 , said it was responsible for the attack			0
ironically , president @entity195 planned the meeting to talk about including members of the @entity200 who turn their back on violent attacks like this one			0
all of it happened in the capital city of @entity5			0
the fighting kept going after president @entity195 had left the area			0
two people who were described as suicide bombers were killed in the violence			0
@entity217 @entity27 : parts of @entity219 are recovering from @entity220			0
it hit the region last weekend			0
one of the countries that was hit the hardest was @entity8			0
more than 150 people were killed there			0
the storm triggered mudslides , destroyed homes , caused more than a dozen bridges to collapse			1
it also caused this ! looks like someone drilled straight into the earth			1
this one 's about a hundred feet deep , more than 60 feet wide			1
it swallowed several buildings ; there are buildings down there ! fortunately , no one was injured by the sinkhole			0
experts say sinkholes can be caused when water dissolves minerals in certain kinds of rocks			1
they can also be caused by different kinds of construction			1
one official thinks that might have contributed to this one			0
@entity254 @entity255 , @entity16 : time for the shoutout ! in roman mythology , who was the god of war ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity264 , b ) @entity21 , c ) @entity266 or @entity267 ) @entity268 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity21 was the god of war and one of the most important gods in roman mythology			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity276 @entity27 : of course , that 's whom the planet is named for			1
@entity21 is the second closest planet to @entity280 , and scientists have talked about going there for years			1
today , a group of explorers is doing it			1
it 'll be like they 're going to @entity21 , though			1
these guys have volunteered to take part in a simulation , spending the next year and a half in a fake spacecraft			0
imagine a reality show , but in space			0
the goal is to find out what the 520 - day trip to @entity21 would be like , how the isolation and cramped spaces would affect people			1
the crew will conduct nearly 100 experiments and even fake a @entity21 landing			1
the volunteers can walk away any time they want			0
why teach ? @entity27 : we 've talked a lot about how the recession has impacted your education			0
teachers are affected , too			0
we 've seen layoffs ; we 've seen budget cuts			0
considering all of the challenges that teachers face , it raises the question , why teach ? well , recently , we asked educators to send in ireports and tell us why they do it , what they love about their jobs			0
take a listen to some of their replies			0
( begin video ) @entity327 , @entity328 : i became a teacher because there is a quotation that says children are the messages that we send to a future that we just do n't know			0
and i thrive every day with the possibility that i can help shape a positive message for the future			0
@entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 : i believe in knowledge and i believe that very few professions offer you the chance to influence the future like teaching does			0
granting somebody the gift of knowledge can lead them to a better life that they otherwise would not have had			0
@entity355 , @entity356 : if , as a teacher , i can supress my own egotistical idea that i know the truth , then i give my students the chance to test their opinions and follow those intellectual threads inward to their own self discovery , with guidance of course			1
this is inner - motivation , and it 's why i call myself a teacher every day			1
( @entity191 ) @entity370 @entity27 : well , teachers , we welcome your ireports , but teachers are n't the only ones who can send them in			0
students , you can too ! in fact , you can send us one about how you 're spending your summer break			1
it 's as easy as this : you make the video			1
go to the @entity386 section which you see right now on @entity388			0
and you click the @entity390 link			0
and once you 're on the page , what you do : scroll down just a bit and click where it says " share your story			0
" that will get your video to our staff			0
you fill out the information you see there , and we will have what we need to take your @entity390			0
now , there is one rule you have to remember : you have to be at least 13 years old			0
the address again : @entity388			0
before we go @entity27 : before we go , you get 10 seconds to shoot a free throw in the pros			0
so , how many do you get to shoot 50 ? @entity411 's going to take one minute , which ties his own world record			1
50 free throws , one minute			0
he also holds the title for the most free throws in two minutes			0
he set both of the records at the school where he 's -- you guessed it -- a shooting coach			1
a local reporter challenged fisher recently			0
the reporter only netted 20			0
goodbye @entity27 : we probably would n't do much better , but it 'd be worth a shot			0
i mean , if it 's free , why not throw your hat in the ring ? those puns were foul			1
thankfully , just one more day to go			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity25 .			0
