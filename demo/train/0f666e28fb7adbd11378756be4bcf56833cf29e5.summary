-- is the anger in @entity3 politics edging towards violence ? a man is shown legally carrying a rifle at a protest against president @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
about a dozen protesters carrying guns gathered this week , not far from a building where president @entity8 was talking to the public about his plans to reform @entity3 healthcare			1
one of them had a rifle slung over his shoulder , a handgun in a holster and bullets in his back pocket			0
last week , a man protested outside another @entity8 healthcare meeting with a gun strapped to his thigh			0
it may be hard to believe but it was n't illegal			0
the meetings were held in parts of the @entity3 that restrict concealed weapons but allow them to be carried freely if they 're in plain sight			1
a small number of activists make a point of exercising that right			0
the @entity44 can bar anyone with a gun from entering the buildings where the president was speaking			1
the protesters stayed far enough away to avoid trouble , though one man was arrested for trespassing and police found a gun in his car			2
in both places , the protesters said they opposed the president 's plans for healthcare but meant him no harm			1
" an armed society is a polite society , " said @entity62			1
should people be allowed to own guns ? sound off below lately , the @entity3 has been anything but polite			1
the healthcare reform plan has sparked the angriest opposition that the president has encountered since taking office			2
most of the ire has been directed at lawmakers , who have also been meeting voters to discuss the plan			0
they 've been interrupted , insulted and threatened			0
@entity8 does n't attend those meetings but he 's hardly overlooked			0
a protester outside one meeting held up a sign saying " death to @entity8 " and " death to @entity82 and her two stupid kids			0
" is the president in danger ? when it comes to armed protesters standing outside a building while the president is inside , a @entity44 spokesman told @entity0 " of course not			1
" but @entity3 remember the assassinations of presidents from @entity94 to @entity95 and the attack that wounded @entity97			2
now , @entity8 's trips across the country to talk about health may be attracting people with guns			0
it 's an odd and unsettling thing .			2

*anti-obama* protesters demonstrate with weapons near where president speaking
in some parts of @entity3 it is legal to carry weapons so long as they are in plain sight
*pro-gun* lobby says " an armed society is a polite society "
