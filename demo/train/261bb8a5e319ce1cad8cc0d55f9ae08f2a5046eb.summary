@entity0 , @entity1 -- exiled @entity7 lawmakers are set to hold a historic debate on the @entity10 's offer to shed his political role , the speaker of their parliament said monday			1
the statement came after the speaker read to the legislators the spiritual leader 's proposals to accord greater powers to their elected representatives			1
" the essence of a democratic system is , in short , the assumption of political responsibility by elected leaders for the popular good			2
in order for our process of democratization to be complete , the time has come for me to devolve my formal authority to such an elected leadership , " the @entity10 said in his message to @entity34 's parliament - in - exile , which is meeting at @entity35 , @entity1			1
" the general lack of experience and political maturity in our democratic institutions has prevented us from doing this earlier , " he added			2
@entity42 , the speaker of the exile unicameral chamber , told @entity2 that its lawmakers would now debate the @entity10 's motion			1
" we should get a sense of the house by tomorrow ( tuesday ) afternoon , " he said			0
the assembly , he explained , will primarily have three options -- accept all his proposals , reject them completely or recommend what he called a middle course by giving more executive powers to the elected leadership of @entity34 exiles			1
in case the lawmakers agree to the @entity10 's proposals in totality , they will be required to set up a special drafting committee to amend their present constitution or the charter , he said			1
the whole process then may take months , possibly beyond the next session slated for june , @entity42 added			0
" but to me , the first option ( of accepting all his proposals ) seems difficult , " the speaker cautioned			1
" this will have many ramifications , including those related to the @entity10 - led dialogue with @entity72			1
" according to @entity42 , the @entity10 could be requested to retain political leadership of the community while devolving his ceremonial powers into elected representatives as a middle ground			1
in his message , the @entity7 community 's global figurehead cited democracy as a key means to the success of his movement			2
" no system of governance can ensure stability and progress if it depends solely on one person without the support and participation of the people in the political process			2
one man rule is both anachronistic and undesirable			0
" we have made great efforts to strengthen our democratic institutions to serve the long - term interests of the six million @entity7 , not out of a wish to copy others , but because democracy is the most representative system of governance , " he wrote			0
the final vote for a new prime minister of his government - in - exile is due on march 20			1
the @entity10 fled @entity72 52 years ago on march 10 , 1959 , after a failed uprising			2
the exile group is headquartered in @entity35			0
he told @entity2 in october that he would like to retire at some point			0
" i 'm also a human being			0
... retirement is also my right , " he said while on a speaking tour of @entity114			0
without saying exactly when , he said , " sooner or later , i have to go			0
i 'm over 75 , so next 10 years , next 20 years , one day i will go			0

@entity119 will consider @entity10 's plan to shed his political role
the lawmakers can accept , reject , or amend the proposal
the speaker of the lawmakers - in - exile says it will be difficult to accept the plan as written
