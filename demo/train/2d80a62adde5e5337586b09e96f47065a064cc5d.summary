-- facing weak support for @entity4 military action , president @entity1 said monday that a plan to have @entity6 hand its chemical arsenal over to international control could avert @entity4 strikes " if it 's real			1
" " it 's certainly a positive development when the @entity14 and @entity6 both make gestures towards dealing with these chemical weapons , " president @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity11 on monday			1
but @entity1 said the threat of @entity4 force would remain , " and we do n't want just a stalling or delaying tactic to put off the pressure that we have on there right now			1
" @entity1 was making the rounds of television interviews in an effort to shore up support for a congressional resolution that would authorize him to launch punitive raids on @entity6 , which his administration accuses of using poison gas against opposition forces and civilians			1
he 's scheduled to address the nation tuesday night , and that speech is still on , he said			0
but a @entity0 / @entity39 out monday found @entity4 strongly opposed to attacking @entity6			1
of the 1,022 people polled between friday and sunday , 59 % said @entity41 should not authorize military action , and 72 % said @entity4 strikes would achieve no significant goals			2
in the @entity45 , majority leader @entity44 postponed a procedural vote that had been scheduled for wednesday after the proposal floated by @entity14 foreign minister @entity48			1
an aide said the @entity14 proposal on chemical weapons is serious and fluid enough that senators do not want to lock themselves into a position on @entity6 just yet			1
the @entity14 proposal came after comments by secretary of state @entity56 earlier monday -- remarks that the @entity57 said were meant to be rhetorical , but which @entity48 proposed concretely			1
asked during a stop in @entity59 whether there was anything @entity6 president @entity63 's government could do or offer that would stop an attack , @entity56 said that @entity63 " could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week " -- adding , " he is n't about to do it , and it ca n't be done , obviously			1
" @entity6 's chemical arsenal at a glance soon afterward , @entity48 said @entity14 , @entity6 's leading ally , urged @entity63 to do just that if it would avert a @entity4 military response			1
and @entity6 foreign minister @entity75 , who was meeting with @entity48 in @entity76 , told reporters that @entity78 welcomes the proposal			1
" we are also confident in the wisdom of the @entity14 government , which is trying to prevent an @entity4 aggression against our people , " @entity75 said			1
@entity87 spokesman @entity86 said @entity88 remained " highly skeptical " of the @entity6 regime			1
but @entity1 told @entity0 , " we have not seen these kinds of gestures up until now , " suggesting his threat of force had prompted " some interesting conversations			2
" " we 're going to run this to ground , " the president said			0
" and @entity56 and the rest of my national security team will engage with the @entity14 and the international community to see , can we arrive at something that is enforceable and serious			2
" ' expect everything ' if @entity4 attacks , @entity63 says @entity88 accuses @entity6 's government of launching a chemical attack outside @entity78 on august 21 , killing more than 1,400 people , hundreds of women and children among them			1
that led to @entity1 's call for military action , with the @entity4 leader arguing that strikes are needed to enforce a longstanding international taboo on the use of poison gas			1
@entity6 denies its forces unleashed chemical weapons , and @entity63 said government troops were on the receiving end of a gas attack			1
@entity122 told " @entity124 " interviewer @entity123 on monday that the @entity125 lacks " a single shred of evidence " that his government was behind the attack			1
samples collected by @entity132 weapons inspectors are still being tested , and even then , the inspection team was charged only with determining whether chemical weapons were used -- not who used them			0
but @entity88 says it knows the trajectory of the rockets used to deliver the gas , that @entity6 commanders ordered troops to don gas masks and learned of fears by top @entity6 officials that @entity132 inspectors would discover evidence of the attack			1
@entity122 warned monday that his country would lash out in potentially unpredictable ways after a @entity4 military strike , telling @entity124 , " you should expect everything			1
" he sidestepped the question of whether he would use chemical weapons against @entity155 forces , but invoked the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity157 and @entity88 to warn that military action has unforeseen consequences			2
" it is difficult for anyone to tell you what is going to happen , " he said			0
" it 's an area where everything is on the brink of explosion			0
" but on @entity0 's " @entity168 , " @entity1 snapped back that @entity6 is no threat to the @entity4			1
" mr. @entity63 does n't have a lot of capability , " @entity1 said			1
" he has capability relative to children			0
he has capability relative to an opposition that is still getting itself organized and are not professional , trained fighters			0
he does n't have a credible means to threaten the @entity4			1
" the @entity132 estimates that more than 100,000 people have been killed in @entity6 's civil war , now 2Â½ years old			2
another 76 deaths were reported on monday , according to the @entity181 , a network of opposition activists			0
of monday 's fatalities , 37 were in @entity78 and its suburbs , where the august 21 attack took place , the @entity181 reported			2
@entity189 intelligence believes that @entity63 ordered the attack because he feared a major rebel attack from the suburbs that could have endangered his control of @entity78 and the route leading to the city 's airport , according to a @entity198 official who briefed reporters on background monday			1
but a @entity202 newspaper reported sunday that @entity202 intelligence intercepted communications that indicate @entity63 had repeatedly denied his military approval for chemical attacks			0
calls to intervene have been shadowed by bitter memories of @entity209 , when the @entity211 administration said that country 's hidden arsenal of chemical and biological weapons and a clandestine nuclear weapons program posed a threat that required a @entity4 - led invasion in 2003			2
@entity209 was later found to have disbanded its weapons programs under @entity132 sanctions in the 1990s			0
lawmakers in @entity222 , which committed troops to @entity209 , voted to preclude their military from participating in any strike			0
@entity189 president @entity226 supports a military response , but @entity189 foreign minister @entity228 said in a statement monday that the @entity14 proposal " deserves a thorough examination			1
" @entity228 said , however , that the @entity232 needs to oversee the process ; that it should start immediately ; and the plan should n't let anyone off the hook for ordering a chemical attack			2
at the @entity132 , @entity238 ban ki - moon said he is also considering asking the @entity232 to demand the @entity6 government immediately hand over its chemical weapons to be destroyed			2
@entity238 said monday that if @entity132 inspectors confirm the use of chemical weapons in @entity6 , it would be an " abominable crime " worthy of international response -- but he has previously warned against " further militarization of the conflict " in @entity6			0
could a ' goof ' be a solution ? a senior @entity57 official who spoke on condition of anonymity said @entity56 and @entity48 were on a previously scheduled call before @entity56 flew back from @entity59 when @entity48 brought up his remarks			0
" i saw your comments this morning , " @entity48 said to @entity56 , the @entity57 official said			0
the @entity14 foreign minister said he would speak about the issue but played down the idea that a proposal was on the table during the 14 - minute conversation , the official said			2
@entity56 told @entity48 that the @entity4 " is not going to ' play games , ' " the official said			0
" if there is a serious proposal , we will take a look			0
" one @entity4 official called @entity56 's remarks a " major goof , " adding that @entity4 's top diplomat " clearly went off script			2
" and several @entity57 representatives tried to clarify @entity56 's remarks later in the day , calling them a " rhetorical argument			0
" " his point was that this brutal dictator with a history of playing fast and loose with the facts can not be trusted to turn over chemical weapons			0
otherwise he would have done so long ago , " @entity57 spokeswoman @entity284 said			0
" that 's why the world faces this moment			0
" the prospect of a diplomatic deal is likely going to make the @entity1 administration 's attempts to make a case before @entity41 even more difficult , said @entity293 , a senior fellow at the @entity294			2
lawmakers who are already debating whether to pass resolutions authorizing military action now may want to rewrite them , he said			0
" it 's going to obviously throw a monkey wrench in the gears on a number of things , " he said			0
but it got a hopeful reception in @entity41 , where the chairwoman of the @entity307 said she would welcome @entity6 's chemical disarmament " to prevent an international strike			2
" " i believe that @entity14 can be most effective in encouraging the @entity6 president to stop any use of chemical weapons and place all his chemical munitions , as well as storage facilities , under @entity132 control until they can be destroyed , " said sen. @entity310 , @entity311			1
@entity310 's @entity87 counterpart , @entity319 @entity318 rep. @entity318 , said @entity88 should review the @entity14 proposal to " see if there 's any teeth to their bark			1
" and sen. @entity324 , @entity325 , the ranking @entity326 on the chamber 's @entity327 , said the best way to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict " is for us as a nation to stay strong			0
" " if it is real , and if @entity6 is willing to make immediate concrete steps , certainly that 's something worth looking at , " @entity324 said			2
" but it 's very difficult to tell if it 's that or just a way of creating a fog around this whole issue			0
" sen. @entity340 , a leading @entity341 on the @entity342 , said the @entity48 proposal is a " distinct change " in @entity14 's stance , " going from sort of defenders of the regime to now saying there 's a real serious problem with chemical weapons in @entity6			1
" " it is very thoughtful , " said @entity340 , of @entity352 , who described himself as undecided on @entity6			0
" it goes to the essential objective that we should have , which is to deter the use of chemical weapons			0
this should not be about trying to settle a civil war raging in @entity6			0
" @entity0 's @entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity365 , @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 , @entity369 and @entity370 contributed to this report .			0

@entity14 proposal a " positive development " but ca n't be a " delaying tactic , " @entity1 says
@entity122 warns @entity88 : " expect everything " if you attack
