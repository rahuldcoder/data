a man who allegedly was with @entity1 the night @entity2 was killed pleaded not guilty friday to a single count of being an accessory to murder after the fact			1
as members of his and @entity2 's family looked on , @entity8 uttered only those two words -- " not guilty " -- during his brief arraignment in @entity12 in the southeastern @entity14 city of @entity15			1
his next court date is set for november 20			0
@entity8 is one of several people who have been charged in connection with @entity2 's death , though only one person -- @entity1 , who was a standout tight end for the @entity21 before being released by the team the day of his arrest -- faces a murder count			1
like @entity1 , @entity8 hails from @entity12 , @entity25			1
during friday 's court hearing , @entity8 's lawyer @entity26 did not contest the $ 500,000 cash bail set for his client , though he could do so later			1
" we do n't have the grand jury minutes , we do n't have a lot of the discovery statements , etc. so i think it 's prudent to wait for the next date until we argue ( bail ) , " @entity26 said			2
authorities have said that @entity1 , @entity38 and @entity8 picked @entity2 up from his @entity40 apartment in a rental car shortly before he was found shot to death june 17 in a @entity45 , @entity14 , industrial park			1
surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and @entity1 carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later			2
he was with two other people			0
@entity2 -- a 27 - year - old semi-pro football player himself -- was not among them			0
@entity8 first told investigators both @entity1 and @entity38 had gotten out of the car with @entity2 at the industrial park , before shots rang out			1
but prosecutors say he later changed his story to claim @entity38 remained in the car , while @entity1 and @entity2 got out			2
asked last month about @entity8 changing his account , his attorney said , " almost every case i 've ever been involved in , the story changes during interrogation			2
" when a professional interrogation takes place , at the end of it sometimes you have trouble remembering your own name			0
" @entity26 said his client had " limited means " and would seek a relatively low bail			0
" he 's a young guy who got caught up in a situation , " @entity26 said			0
" and when all this came about , he was frightened and confused , as you can imagine anyone would be			0
i believe he 's an honest guy			0
