-- in a city where style is king , a @entity5 football giant is in need of an urgent makeover , according to the @entity9 businessman who has taken on the challenge			2
one of only two overseas owners in @entity13 after buying a 70 % stake in @entity15 in november 2013 , @entity11 believes globalization is the key to reviving this grand institution			1
he remembers @entity21 football 's golden age of the 1990s , but given @entity13 's current plight -- corruption scandals , racism , fan violence and dilapidated stadia -- those days seem a distant memory			1
even @entity11 admits his 15 - year - old son is more interested in talking about players from the @entity30 than @entity21			1
his solution is for @entity21 football to open its arms to the world , arguing there are 260 million potential @entity15 fans across the globe , with as many as 165 million supporters in @entity39 just waiting to be reconnected with a league dominated in recent years by @entity41			1
" @entity13 has be to more aggressive , " the 44 - year - old @entity11 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview , as he laid out his vision to revive his underachieving club			1
@entity15 last won the scudetto in 2010 and failed to qualify for this season 's @entity46 , though the team is in the second - tier @entity49 if @entity11 comes armed with ideas to overhaul @entity15 , he also issues a blunt warning for @entity13 , which in recent years has arguably become @entity54 football 's ugly duckling			1
" i specifically tell people if we do another @entity58 , @entity13 will be dead , " said @entity11 , referring to the 2006 scandal when @entity41 was heavily sanctioned			1
" @entity21 wo n't be number two , not three , or even fourth			2
we will be ninth and lose ground to countries like @entity62 and @entity63			0
" it 's important to look at the world globally and not just @entity21			2
the ( other club ) presidents are open - minded when we talk			0
a lot of things have to be done			0
" @entity15 earns $ 95 million from domestic and international television rights deals and expects to earn an extra 10 % next year , but those sums are dwarfed by the $ 9.4 billion that the @entity30 's 20 teams share in their latest three - year contract			1
the 2014 - 2015 turnover forecast for @entity15 is $ 240 million , but again , that 's less than half of @entity78 's current $ 551 million revenue , according to @entity79			2
" the @entity30 has become bigger and bigger , but @entity13 can become the second league in the world , " said @entity11			2
" we still have a good foundation and can compete with @entity85 's @entity84 and @entity87 's @entity86			0
" comparing @entity13 with the @entity30 is like chalk and cheese , admits @entity15 's chief executive officer @entity90 , who previously worked for @entity78 and entertainment company @entity91 before he was appointed by @entity11 in july			1
one of @entity93 's first tasks it to increase @entity15 's home attendances at the @entity95 , a stadium the club shares with @entity98			2
last season @entity15 had the highest average @entity13 crowd -- 46,246 -- but given the @entity95 's 80,000 capacity that 's still a lot of empty seats			1
on arriving from @entity103 , @entity93 was surprised to learn @entity15 had no football museum of its own at the @entity95 , though it does share one with @entity98			0
@entity78 's @entity106 museum annually has 400,000 visitors who shell out $ 29 for a visit which also includes a stadium tour , while the joint @entity95 museum has 270,000 visitors who pay $ 21			0
@entity15 now hopes to build its own museum			0
while @entity93 crunches the numbers , @entity11 wants more top - flight games kicking off at 3 p.m at the weekend to enable a greater number fans in @entity39 and the @entity116 to watch @entity21 football			1
" we need to talk to our fans globally , " added @entity11			0
" the beauty of @entity98 is , as well as football , there 's also fashion and culture			0
" with the @entity124 now playing games in @entity39 , the @entity126 coming to @entity54 and baseball matches taking place in @entity129 , @entity11 is also open to the idea of @entity13 matches being played outside of @entity21			1
" a lot of fans in different regions want to see the real live game rather than on their television or computer			0
" given a similar idea in @entity103 has not been openly embraced by a number of @entity30 clubs ' fans , @entity11 might have trouble winning over @entity21 hardcore supporters , who in the past have proved a stumbling block to reform			1
however , according to @entity148 , who writes about @entity21 fan culture , even the ultras realize things can no longer stay the same			0
" they know the stadiums are outdated and attendances are suffering and it 's not a family event , " said @entity148 , who has written about @entity15 for the @entity152 newspaper @entity151 and @entity116 broadcaster @entity153			2
the ultras see that the @entity30 has " lost part of its soul , " according to @entity148 , who says many @entity21 fans would prefer @entity13 clubs to follow the @entity84 model , where teams are more closely aligned to their supporters and and represented at boardroom level			1
" the fans have to trust us , because what we do is good for the club , " replies @entity11 , when asked if he would consider implementing such a model at @entity15			2
" @entity21 has the tradition of the president , but we need to be more professional and corporate and still involve the fans to help us grow			0
" in @entity15 's last two games , the patience of even diehard " @entity15 " might have been tested as coach @entity181 's team capitulated at home to @entity183 and then at @entity184			2
those two defeats demonstrated just how much work @entity11 and his team have to do in resuscitating this ailing @entity13 giant , which languishes in 10th place ahead of sunday 's home clash with @entity191			1
" i 'm not looking for personal success , " @entity11 says			0
" it 's more about how can i work hard , supported by my new team , to make @entity15 one of the top - 10 clubs in the world			1
with a lot of support and the same vision we can do it			0
" @entity11 's decision to acquire a majority stake in @entity15 with his @entity9 business partner @entity205 followed investments in the @entity124 's @entity207 and the @entity209 team @entity208			1
conscious of the new constraints imposed by @entity54 's governing body @entity211 with its financial fair play system , @entity11 wants @entity15 to use more data and analytics in following the player - buying strategies pioneered by @entity216 -- the subject of @entity218 ' -- at the @entity219			1
" when we decide a player -- we do it collectively , " said @entity11			0
" we sign on the tactical , financial and commercial side			0
" this is the model for @entity208 and it 's been pretty sustainable			0
so far at @entity15 , we have done ok			0
we do n't want to create bureaucracy and it 's important to reduce the risk			0
" like fashion , football can be a risky business , but for @entity11 , criticism is " medicine to him			0
" but will it be the tonic needed to wake @entity21 's " sleeping giant " ? the football world looks set to find out .			1
