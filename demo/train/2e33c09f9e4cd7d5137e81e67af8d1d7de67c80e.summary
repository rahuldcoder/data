-- in september 1985 a devastating earthquake measuring 8.1 on the @entity2 smashed into @entity3 killing 10,000 people and leaving parts of the city in ruins			1
since then , the populous @entity9 nation of 122 million has invested in one of the most advanced seismic warning systems anywhere in the world			1
the @entity14 facility came online in 1991 and reacts to data gathered by sensors placed near major fault lines along @entity3 's @entity18			1
receivers dotted around five major cities , including @entity3 and @entity21 , will sound the alarm if they detect an earthquake			1
it 's a system that can buy vital seconds for residents to brace themselves before the tremors begin			1
but not everyone has access to a @entity14 receiver -- there are 100,000 in operation but at a cost of roughly $ 330 apiece , they are a luxury the majority of @entity37 ca n't afford			2
most receivers are stationed in the likes of public buildings , hospitals , schools and subway stations			2
with roughly 21 million people living both formally and informally in and around @entity3 alone , that means many will not be aware the alarm is sounding until the ground begins shaking			1
$ 50 alarm according to local tech entrepreneur , @entity51 , such vital services should be far more widely available			0
@entity52 is no passive observer in this debate			0
he moved to @entity3 after working in @entity55 and witnessing the devastation caused by the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck the @entity59 island in 2010 killing more than 230,000 people			1
it 's an experience that had a profound and lasting effect on him			2
" until you live in one of these places you do n't really understand the primitive fear of earthquakes , " he said			0
" there are times when you ca n't sleep and sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and make sure things are n't moving			0
" now , after combining with local engineers and tech investors based in @entity75 , @entity52 believes he may have a solution that will bring the @entity14 signal to the masses			2
it 's called the @entity81 ( the @entity83 word for cricket ) early warning system			1
the compact device -- a cube about the size of an alarm clock -- taps into the special frequencies that @entity14 operates on and relays that information to its users			2
when seismic activity is detected , the @entity93 sounds a loud , flashing alarm			1
at a cost of just $ 50 , it also undercuts the price of the receivers used primarily in public buildings by around 85 %			2
" this is the most affordable and the most direct way for the @entity37 public to connect to the early warning system , " @entity52 says of the product , which also became @entity3 's most successful ever @entity103 campaign			1
@entity3 's geographic location and geological makeup put it at particular risk from seismic activity			1
there have been a handful of relatively small quakes in 2014 already			0
@entity52 also hopes versions of the @entity81 system could be introduced elsewhere in the world where earthquakes are a real risk -- like in @entity120 , @entity121 , the @entity122 of the @entity123 and along much of the @entity18 of @entity124			1
missing education ? but others point to the difficulty of introducing a mass warning system without first educating citizens on what to do when receiving a direct alert			1
speaking to @entity136 earlier this year , @entity133 , director of the @entity134 at the @entity135 , pondered what would happen if 5,000 of 60,000 people in a football stadium received an alert of an imminent earthquake ? " people should know that the safest thing to do is to stay in the stadium , " he said			2
on top of that , the $ 50 price is still a considerable investment for many residents of a country where the average wage remains under $ 5 a day			0
then there is the fact that only a handful of early warning systems like @entity14 exist anywhere in the world			0
this means that @entity93 will unlikely have government sourced data and advanced sensor system set up near major fault lines to tap into in many other locations			1
@entity52 and his colleagues have anticipated such difficulties			0
he speaks of the next stage of the @entity168 project which will see hundreds of specially developed sensors placed all over @entity3 , feeding into an algorithm that will provide early - warning alerts to apps and smartphones			1
warning app known as @entity175 , the tiny orange devices contain a sensitive movement detector , microprocessor and a @entity180 module to transmit a signal			0
@entity93 are currently in talks with a major convenience store chain to locate the devices at between 500 and 1,000 of their stores around @entity3			1
such a wide spread will ensure more reliable and faster alerts			0
" the real test of a good infrastructure is the density of sensors , " @entity52 said			0
" this is our plan in @entity3			2
" given that the devices can be produced cheaply and located anywhere with an internet connection , the potential for @entity93 to be used in a variety of vulnerable areas around the world is very real			2
@entity202 remains the only nation in the world where the entire country is hooked up to an early warning facility			0
and that system , which consists of 1,000 gps sensors			0
for now , however , this fledgling group 's focus remains on @entity3			1
the first small batch of @entity168 boxes produced have been sold , although they have n't yet seen any action in the field			0
@entity3 's last earthquake was recorded about six months ago , when the device was still in the prototype phase			1
@entity52 hopes that the acid test does n't come too soon , but he expects a solid performance from his invention when it does			0
" the science is all there , " he said			0
" we have tested it out in two earthquakes and they worked just fine			0
one was a seven pointer ( on the @entity2 ) and it worked perfectly			0
" now , they await the next earthquake .			0

@entity93 is a device that aims to bring a low - cost earthquake warning system to the masses in @entity3
a number of major fault lines are situated along @entity3 's @entity18
some say a *widespread* program of public education is required so people know what to do when seismic activity occurs
