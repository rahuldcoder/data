-- @entity1 is working with @entity2 to develop a phone that has a much deeper integration with the social network than any previous " @entity1 phone			1
" that 's according to a report from @entity9 , which says the phone is probably 12 to 18 months away from hitting store shelves			1
codenamed " @entity15 " after the vampire slayer of the same name , the phone will run a modified version of @entity18 's @entity17 , but @entity1 is reported to be tweaking the system " heavily			1
" @entity2 is known for modifying @entity17 on its phones with its @entity22 interface , and both @entity23 and @entity24 have created tablets with highly customized versions of the @entity17 , so it 's possible that @entity1 is adopting a similar strategy			1
part of the package would be serving up @entity1 apps via @entity33 support			2
this would allow users to play games like @entity37 and @entity38 directly from the @entity1 app. while most developers offer their apps as separate downloads from @entity1 , that prevents them from tapping into active @entity1 users , while cutting @entity1 off from potential revenues			2
@entity15 would presumably bridge the gap			0
@entity15 will be far from the first @entity1 phone			2
earlier this year @entity48 released two phones , the @entity50 and @entity51 that put the service front and center			1
then @entity2 took it a step further with the status , which came to the @entity57 on @entity58 this summer and featured a prominent dedicated @entity1 button			1
finally , @entity1 released an app designed specifically for the @entity61 in october			0
@entity62 , however , has n't played as nice with @entity1 as the service might have liked , however			0
when @entity62 unveiled @entity64 5 , the latest major update to the software on iphones and @entity61 , it featured deeper integration with @entity68 -- letting users share photos directly from the phone 's camera app , for example			0
an option for sharing to @entity1 was noticeably absent			0
both @entity2 and @entity1 told @entity0 that they do n't comment on rumor and speculation , though the @entity1 spokesperson added , " our mobile strategy is simple : we think every mobile device is better if it is deeply social			1
we 're working across the entire mobile industry ; with operators , hardware manufacturers , os providers , and application developers to bring powerful social experiences to more people around the world			0
" the collaborative picture @entity1 paints is a far cry from the ultra-competitive war among mobile platforms with @entity18 , @entity62 , @entity1 , and others vying for consumers ' hearts and minds			1
perhaps the most telling aspect of the rumored phone is the codename			0
with a name like @entity15 , the @entity1 phone 's mission is clear : slay all comers			2
