-- everything is awesome for the team behind " the @entity3			1
" the @entity5 animated extravaganza is estimated to have earned a spectacular $ 69.11 million this weekend — the biggest opening of the still young year , and the second largest february opening ever ( the top spot belongs to 2004 ′ s " @entity9 " )			1

after all the fuss around the delayed release , it seems that pushing " @entity82 " out of the holidays ( and awards season ) was the best thing it could have done in terms of earnings and mustering up an undistracted audience			0

for @entity97 's starring roles , crossing $ 100 million is a career high , too			2
" @entity115 " topped out at $ 91.5 million in 2012			0
@entity97 has three more releases slated for this year , including next weekend 's " @entity117			1
