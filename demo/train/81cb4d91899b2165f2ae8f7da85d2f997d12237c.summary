-- according to popular wisdom , attempting to reinvent the wheel is the ultimate in design folly			1
but this did n't stop object designer @entity6 from giving it a go			2
when he sat down at his desk to begin work on the @entity12 , @entity9 took on the design challenge -- and the results might just turn out to be revolutionary			0
in both senses of the word			0
the @entity12 is a detachable wheelchair wheel that can compress to around half of its original width			1
it is designed to provide greater flexibility and mobility to the estimated 65 million people around the world who need a wheelchair			1
the folding wheel was originally created as a folding bicycle wheel by @entity6 when he was a graduate student at the @entity28 in @entity29			1
but calls from the wheelchair community suggested to him that the design would possibly be more useful to wheelchair users			1
" when people say ' is this reinventing the wheel ? ' , that 's a phrase that everyone knows , " @entity6 says , " but it 's really redesigning the wheel to make it just a little bit better			0
that 's really what you 're trying to do when you 're designing any product			0
" the main advantage of the @entity12 , the designer says , is that it can fit into small spaces , allowing wheelchair users greater flexibility when traveling by car , train or airplane			1
" this project started out by looking at the problems caused by large wheels if you 're looking at folding bicycles , or the space needed for a folding wheelchair , " says @entity6			0
" having a small wheel or a large wheel dictates the entire design of the wheelchair and what you can do with it			1
if you can fold a big wheel up into a smaller space , then suddenly for the first time you can get the best of both worlds			0
you can have a wheelchair that has all the advantages of having a large wheel , but can also be stored into a much smaller space			2
" @entity75 co-founder of @entity76 , a charity that aims to help people with mobility impairments , says that in his view the @entity12 wheel could be useful in both developed countries and the developing world			0
" i can see all kinds of uses for this , " says @entity75 , " certainly in the context of the @entity87 and more developed countries ... car boots , airplane lockers , any sort of small space you might want to pack a small chair into			2
" not everybody uses a chair every day , so if it has got quick - release wheels and you fold the chair up and you fold these down flat storage is easy for people who do n't use a wheelchair all the time			2
" in the context i work in developing countries , if it 's low - cost enough , people often live in one room with the whole families , so they often want a folding wheelchair just to keep it out of the way when they 're either in bed or sat on the floor cooking , and so again , something that packs down as small as this would be extremely useful			2
" the @entity112 wheel has received awards around the world , including the transport category at the @entity117 design of the year awards 2013 , and the 2013 popular science @entity119 award in the health category			1
