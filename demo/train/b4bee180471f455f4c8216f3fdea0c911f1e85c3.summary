entering the @entity1 at @entity3 's @entity2 is like walking into an alchemist 's workshop			1
the room smells strongly of burning sage , and there are old books stacked high on wooden shelves			2
an antique distillation kit sits in the disused fireplace with tiny glass bottles of oil , and long swaths of black cowhide hang from the walls			0
but most striking is the chameleonic couture on display			0
a bejeweled headdress , created with @entity23 's gemstones division , changes color based on the heat generated by the wearer 's neural activity , thanks to hyper - conductive stones and heat - sensitive ink			1
the three sculptural leather jackets are infused with dye formulas that change color in response to different stimuli : friction , the temperature and humidity of the room , and intense heat			1
in its own room is a fragile ceramic dress called @entity43 , covered with hand - painted pixels that reflect brain activity detected by an accompanying @entity47 headset			1
this was the public 's formal introduction to @entity51 , a trio of @entity3 fashion designers using chemistry , digital technology and exquisite tailoring to create fashion magic			1
last october , @entity51 's designers -- founder @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 -- moved base from a cluttered studio in the vaults under @entity2 to a room in the building 's new wing			1
when you enter , the one - off color - changing showpieces that have made them the darlings of the smart materials world immediately draw your attention , but there are other items on display too : color - changing trinkets -- candles , moleskine notebooks and the like -- from their new product line			1
they may be known for their fashion output , but the designers are eager to expand beyond the label			0
" for me , it 's more of an exploration house , " says @entity59			1
" it 's like a materials house at @entity92 with science and a side of magic			2
" in that case , @entity59 , who masterminds @entity51 's formulas and materials , could be considered the chief magician			1
before launching @entity51 in february , she worked as a textiles consultant in a number of fields , from fashion to aviation			0
in 2013 , tired of altering her ideas to meet corporate ends , she decided to venture out on her own with the help of a Â £ 25,000 ( $ 38,000 ) grant from @entity110 ( then known as the @entity111 ) , and her best friends @entity61 and @entity113 , who are responsible for designing and executing the sculptural pieces			2
( the trio often describe themselves as " the three witches with one eye " because of their shared creative vision , and each has a flesh - tone tattoo of an eye on their inner finger to drive the point home			2
) @entity59 , who has studied both fashion and chemistry , first started developing responsive color - change compounds while earning her masters in textiles at the @entity130 , inspired by the debilitating spinal condition that has her in and out of hospital			1
" i really want to create a product range for myself that means that i can monitor my spine and condition , " she says			0
" i do n't listen to myself when i 'm getting ill , and it gets to the point where i 'm on crutches before i 'll listen to the fact that i have to look after myself			0
" early in her career she worked with the @entity110 's @entity142 to develop a series of responsive bandages , but when it became clear that it would take at least 20 years to produce a working sample under their funding model , the project was shelved			0
she returned to her fashion roots to overcome this problem			0
" i just thought there 's got to be a quicker or more profitable way to do this , rather than doing this in pure research , " she says			0
" ( the purpose of @entity51 ) was n't to be in all the press and everywhere			0
it was a strategic plan so we can create products that help people in their daily lives			2
" while they have n't developed chemistry - infused garments to help people just yet , @entity51 's current output has attracted attention across industries			2
they recently hosted representatives from luxury car companies interested in using their color change technology , and the team is gearing up to announce a very hush - hush capsule collection for a high - end heritage retailer			1
recently , they 've been in talks about exhibiting at @entity176 in @entity177 and the newly reopened @entity178 , @entity179 in @entity180 , and they will be showcasing their work at @entity182 in @entity183 , @entity184 this march			0
there are also ongoing discussions with the neurology team at @entity188 about a collaboration that would give the unseen unprecedented access to state - of - the - art ink technologies			1
but their next collection , which will likely be released next fall , is still somewhat of a mystery , even to them			0
only one thing is certain : it wo n't involve color change			1
" i do n't want us to be a gimmick and then next year nobody 's talking about us			0
i 'm adamant that we will be around in 50 years , " @entity59 says			2
" i really want @entity51 to become an iconic brand known for pushing innovation and pushing materials in a magical way			0
