the bulk of the more than 96,000 @entity3 refugees headed to @entity12 and @entity13 , according to the @entity2 high commissioner for refugees office			1
the rest sought refuge in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and the @entity21 , the agency said			1
last weekend , at least 60 refugees died en route to @entity12 , a frequent destination for @entity25 and @entity27 refugees , according to @entity28 , known by its @entity30 acronym @entity28			1
@entity31 said most of those who died were forced overboard in deep water off @entity12 's coast by smugglers who demanded more money than the $ 100 they paid for the journey			2
" those who did not or could not pay extra were severely beaten by the smugglers , " @entity31 said in a news release tuesday			0
" up to 40 -- mainly @entity27 -- [ were ] thrown overboard despite their pleas for mercy			0
" @entity43 , @entity28 's field coordinator in southern @entity12 , said such a high number of refugee deaths in a short period of time " is not usual at all			2
" " for the whole of september until now , we 've had 27 dead and now suddenly we reach this number , " @entity43 told @entity0 from @entity28 's base in @entity50 , @entity12			2
" we are quite shocked here			0
" about 30,000 @entity3 refugees arrived on boats on @entity13 's shores during the first 10 months of this year compared with 19,900 refugees last year , according to @entity31			1
in @entity18 , an estimated 2,600 boat people arrived in the first nine months of this year from @entity57 , compared with 1,800 last year , @entity31 said			1
. the agency said that from january to october this year , 509 of those attempting to make the journey to @entity13 and @entity18 died , compared with last year 's death toll of 471			1
more than 38,000 people have made the perilous journey across the @entity64 from @entity25 to @entity12 during the first 10 months of this year , a " considerable increase from the 29,500 who made the same journey during the whole of last year , " @entity31 said tuesday			1
however , the death toll on that route has remained lower so far this year : more than 600 have died or disappeared en route to @entity12 compared to 1,400 killed last year			1
in late september , at least 52 @entity25 died when the boat smuggling them across the @entity64 to @entity12 broke down , and they were left adrift with no food or water for 18 days , according to the @entity2 many are fleeing the war in @entity25 , but @entity43 of @entity28 told @entity0 on monday that he has noticed a recent increase in the number of refugees from @entity27			1
" it used to be 10 percent of total arrival , and now it 's around 50 - 50 , " he said			0
@entity12 is a common destination for @entity25 fleeing economic hardship and war because of its proximity			2
it is also an attractive location because @entity25 receive automatic refugee status in the fellow @entity91 country			0
new smuggling routes , including some based out of @entity93 -- which lies north of @entity25 and is much closer to @entity12 -- have also led to the increase in refugees , according to the @entity31			1
but according to the @entity96 , @entity12 is just a stopping point for most of the refugees , who then travel on to the wealthier @entity99 or @entity100 and the @entity101			1
earlier this year , @entity12 's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline in an attempt to deter the smugglers			2
some of the smuggling boats seized by @entity12 's coast guard are given to @entity25 fishermen who suffered losses in the december 2004 @entity111 tsunami			0
as part of a $ 19 million operation , @entity31 operates shelters and reception centers for the refugees in @entity12 and has increased its efforts to discourage people from making the illegal crossing to @entity12			2
it has also sponsored training programs for coast guard personnel and other officials			0
@entity28 said the plight of the refugees has been overshadowed by the dozens of pirate attacks off @entity25 's coast that have grabbed international headlines in recent months			0
" a lot of attention has been paid lately to tackling the issue of piracy in the waters off the @entity135 , " said @entity129 mission leader @entity128			0
" unfortunately , little attention is paid to the drama of the refugees crossing the same waters in horrific conditions			0
much more needs to be done to address this issue			0

bulk of the more than 96,000 @entity3 refugees headed to @entity12 and @entity13 , @entity2 says
