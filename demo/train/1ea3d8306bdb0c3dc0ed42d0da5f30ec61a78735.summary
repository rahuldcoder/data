-- four days before @entity5 basketball star @entity4 hoped to be drafted into the @entity6 , his dreams of playing in the pros were extinguished by a rare genetic disease called marfan syndrome			1
" i had a dream that my name was going to be called , " @entity4 told @entity9			2
but after a standard physical , test results revealed he had marfan syndrome			1
" they said i would n't be able to play basketball no more , at a competitive level			0
... they told me my arteries and my heart are enlarged , and that if i overwork myself or push myself , my heart could rupture			0
" marfan syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation that leaves connective tissue in the body weak , according to the @entity24			1
the defective gene can also cause excessive growth of longer bones in the body , although it 's not clear why this happens			1
people with marfan syndrome are usually very tall and thin			1
they often have longer than usual arms , legs , fingers and toes , according to the @entity24			0
@entity34 , at 7 - foot - 1 , matches this description			0
the center from @entity37 , @entity38 , revealed during his sophomore season at @entity5 that he is blind in his right eye as a result of a detached retina he suffered as a teenager			2
he was expected to be the first partially blind player in the @entity6			2
eye problems are a common effect of marfan syndrome			1
curved spines , chests that stick out or sink in , flexible joints , and stretch marks not related to weight gain or loss are also visible signs of marfan syndrome			1
less visible , and often unnoticed until it 's too late : weak parts of the aorta -- the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body -- which can tear or rupture			0
leaky heart valves that can cause a heart murmur are also among the symptoms			0
as devastating as the news may be for @entity34 , getting this diagnosis now may be a lifesaver			0
" people with marfan syndrome can live a long life if they are diagnosed and treated with medication and , when necessary , surgery , " @entity72 , president and ceo of @entity74 , said in a statement			1
" competitive and contact sports need to be halted to protect the fragile aorta			0
otherwise , it is prone to tear and possibly rupture , which would cause sudden death			0
" " while it is disappointing for @entity4 that he can not pursue a career in the @entity6 , receiving the diagnosis before a fatal episode is truly a gift			1
" nearly 30 years ago , @entity91 volleyball player @entity90 was playing in a @entity93 league			0
after being taken out of a game for a routine substitution , @entity94 reported in 1986 , she sat on the bench , slid to the floor and died			0
her diagnosis of marfan syndrome was made only after her family requested an autopsy			1
@entity103 never knew she was playing with a dime - sized weak spot on her aorta that burst during the game			0
the @entity74 estimates about 200,000 people in the @entity91 have marfan syndrome or a related disorder ; about half do n't know it			1
most people who have marfan syndrome inherit it from their parents , according to the @entity24 , though a quarter of the cases are not inherited			2
there is no cure for @entity119 syndrome , but getting regular checkups , having surgery , taking medications and wearing a medical alert bracelet can help someone living with the disease have the best possible outcome .			2

@entity6 hopeful @entity4 diagnosed with marfan syndrome
marfan syndrome is a rate genetic disease that leaves connective tissue weak
