-- there was a time when movie props were worthless			0
when a film wrapped , the studio would often recycle props and costumes for use in other films , or sometimes simply throw them away			2
but that 's changed over the years , and now movie collectibles are a big business , with high - profile props going for hundreds of thousands of dollars			1
unfortunately , when you start talking that kind of money , there are bound to be a few crooked characters who will do whatever it takes to get their hands on a piece of @entity25 history			0
has anyone questioned the flying monkeys ? it 's believed there were six or seven pairs of @entity32 's famous ruby red slippers made for the production of the 1939 film " @entity35 "			1
of those , the location of four pairs is currently known , including one that resides in the @entity41			0
the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44 , had their own pair , until the shoes were stolen one night in august 2005			2
the case went cold until this past april , when police received a tip that a resident in @entity51 , @entity52 , had not only bragged about paying someone to steal the slippers , but openly displayed the shoes in a glass box			0
police raided the alleged thief 's house , but did n't find the ruby red shoes			2
for now , the case remains open , and the shoes are still at - large			2
" @entity63 " choppers chopped there are few motorcycles more iconic than the ones ridden by @entity67 and the late , great @entity68 in their counterculture classic , " @entity63			1
" there were four custom motorcycles built for the film -- two copies of each bike , including the " @entity80 " chopper ridden by @entity76 , featuring a star - spangled fuel tank and an extra long fork for the front wheels			1
one of the @entity80 bikes was destroyed during filming , while the other three motorcycles were stolen from a storage garage before the film was even in the can			1
obviously the bikes were n't famous yet , so they were presumably stripped and sold for parts			0
the thieves left the damaged @entity80 bike , which was later restored , and now resides at the @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity92			0
@entity0 : what 10 movie props later sold for 3			0
the man without the golden gun in the 1974 movie " @entity99 , " @entity96 takes on @entity98 , an expert assassin who charges $ 1 million per kill			1
the hitman 's signature is a custom - made , solid gold gun that can be cleverly disassembled and disguised as everyday items like a cigarette case , a lighter , a pen , and a cuff link			1
there were three prop guns made for the film -- one that came apart , another that did n't come apart , and one that could fire a blank round			1
in october 2008 , one of these props ( it 's unclear which one it was ) was discovered missing from its display case at @entity119 in @entity120 , @entity121			1
police still have no leads on the disappearance of the prop , worth an estimated Â£ 80,000 ( $ 117,000 ) on the collector 's black market			2
the case of the missing " @entity129 " there were a handful of falcon statues made for the 1941 noir classic , " @entity138 " , starring @entity134 as @entity136 's famous private eye , @entity137			1
over the years , nearly all original models of the bird have been lost , making the few remaining copies very valuable -- including one that sold for nearly $ 400,000 in 1994			2
for promotional purposes , plaster casts of the bird were made upon the film 's release , and @entity149 , a character actor who played a henchman in the film , got his hands on one			1
his copy of the bird was later acquired by @entity155 in @entity156 , a restaurant dedicated to @entity136 , who often wrote and ate there in the 1930s			0
the replica bird was on display for years , sitting on the second floor in a display case for all to see			0
that is , of course , until the day it disappeared in 2007			0
@entity0 : who invented the @entity169 shower ? after the falcon went missing , @entity155 offered a no - questions - asked reward of $ 25,000 to the person who brought it back , but no one came forward			1
the owner could have easily gotten a good replacement replica off @entity178 for a few hundred bucks , but he took a different approach instead			0
he put the $ 25,000 towards the creation of a new , original design of the @entity129 that is a more stylized interpretation than the one used in the 1941 film			2
the new statue is five inches taller than the original and weighs around 150 pounds , three times heavier than the plaster replica that was stolen			2
to ensure this bird does n't go missing , it 's been bolted down and is monitored 24/7 by closed - circuit cameras			1
with that much security , the next time someone messes with this @entity129 , it wo n't take @entity137 to crack the case			0
well , that 's one way to get an @entity195 in march 2000 , a few guys got their hands on the ultimate movie collector 's item when they stole 55 @entity195 just days before the @entity195 ceremony			2
@entity201 , a dock worker at delivery company @entity202 , conspired with a fellow employee , truck driver @entity203 , to load 10 boxes of @entity195 onto @entity203 's truck			2
@entity203 then took the statues to the home of accomplice @entity208 for safekeeping until they could line up black market buyers			0
however , the men got spooked by the publicity surrounding the missing statues and dumped the boxes in an alleyway instead			2
shortly after , @entity208 ' half - brother , @entity216 , found 52 of the @entity195 while rummaging through the trash , looking for packing boxes to use during a move			2
after reporting his find to police , @entity216 collected a $ 50,000 reward from @entity202 , but the other men did n't make out quite so well			0
@entity201 received the lightest sentence with three years probation			0
@entity208 was sentenced to six months in jail , three years probation , and had to pay $ 921 to the @entity195 in restitution for the three missing statues			0
@entity229 was given six months in prison , five years probation , had to pay the @entity195 $ 1,050 , and pay @entity202 the full amount of the reward they offered to @entity216			0
as for the three missing @entity195 , one was found in 2003 during a @entity234 drug raid , but the other two are still out there somewhere			0
@entity0 : where 10 @entity195 winners keep their statues 6			0
big bucks in spandex apparently no one 's spider - sense was tingling when crooks made off with four hand - made superhero suits from the set of the first @entity247 film			1
each @entity247 costume , valued at around $ 50,000 a piece , disappeared from a locked building on the @entity251 lot , leading authorities to believe it was an inside job			1
police received a tip from the ex-wife of a former security guard at @entity251 , @entity258 , who said he might be involved in the theft			0
police searched @entity258 's home and found records indicating that one costume was at a friend 's house , two were traced to a collector in @entity268 , and the last one was in the collection of a man in @entity271			0
adding to @entity258 's woes , police also found in his home a mannequin dressed in a $ 150,000 @entity277 costume that went missing from the @entity279 lot in 1996			1
not coincidentally , @entity258 worked as a security guard at @entity279 at the time			0
for stealing the @entity247 suits , @entity258 got 9 months in jail , 5 years probation , and had to pay $ 93,000 in restitution			1
@entity0 : strange robberies : @entity287 's bustier 7			1
do collectors dream of rubber handguns ? as he 's hunting android replicants in a dystopian future , " @entity292 's " @entity290 , played by @entity291 , carries a strange - looking handgun that has captivated sci - fi fans for decades			1
the prop was custom - made using pieces from real firearms , including a bolt action from a rifle , two triggers , various knobs and dials , and even led lights			1
to prevent their very expensive , one - of - a - kind prop from breaking , the producers made two solid rubber copies that were indistinguishable from the original at a distance , and could be knocked around during stunt scenes without getting damaged			1
but during the shoot , one of the dummy guns went missing and was never seen again			0
oddly enough though , about a month after the film was released , highly accurate plastic replicas of @entity290 's gun began appearing for sale on the collector 's market			1
these knock - offs were so close to the ones used in the film that they must have been created using molds taken from the missing , now presumed stolen , dummy gun			1
while it 's certain the thief made a pretty penny by selling the dummy gun , he would have surely been better off stealing the custom - made gun instead -- it sold at auction in 2009 for $ 270,000			1
