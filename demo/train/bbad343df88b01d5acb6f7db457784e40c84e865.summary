-- when @entity2 and i first started slinging scoops in 1978 , we knew that it was about more than just the ice cream ; it was about community			2
our first scoop shop was in a dilapidated gas station that we renovated with a small loan , a little pocket change and a lot of green wood			0
in the summer , folks would crowd around at the picnic tables late into the evenings and lounge on the grass laughing , talking and eating ice cream			0
ice cream brings people together			1
we might not agree on politics or religion , heck we might not agree on @entity25 or @entity26 , but that does n't mean we ca n't talk			1
and in that way , ice cream teaches us a lesson about democracy			1
democracy is the triple - deluxe droolworthy idea that the people can govern and be governed in turn , that @entity36 are the author and the subject of the law			1
in @entity41 , it 's the idea that we can elect representatives who will rise above self - interest and work on behalf of the common good			0
at least , that was the idea			0
these days , it looks a little different			0
thanks to @entity50 cases such as @entity51 in 2010 , which trampled over the last remaining semblance of campaign finance laws , our government looks a lot more like a plutocracy : a government where the wealthy rule			1
the massive influx of corporate dough does n't guarantee victory for @entity61 or @entity62			2
but it allows wealthy donors to control the national conversation and drown out other voices , making it harder and harder for the people to be heard			2
it allows corporations to bully our representatives and influence their votes			2
all they have to do is threaten to throw gobs of cash against members of @entity76 who oppose them , and they can chill democratic debate			0
when @entity80 gave a farewell address to @entity76 in 1796 , he talked about why the @entity41 @entity82 deserved the people 's support and confidence			2
it was n't because it contained immutable , universal principles ; it was because the people wrote it and the people have the power to alter it			1
well , if we 're going to save our democracy , we need a constitutional amendment that declares once and for all : 1 ) money is not free speech			1
2 ) corporations are not people			2
the movement to amend is already making big waves			0
thirteen states and more than 500 municipalities have passed ballot initiatives calling on @entity76 to propose a constitutional amendment			0
more than 150 congressmen and president @entity106 say they would support an amendment			0
but change wo n't happen if we sit back and let other people do the dirty work			1
we need a stampede to rout the special interests who have corralled @entity76			1
and that 's what we 're doing			0
the @entity116 encourages people to adorn their dollars , to beautify their bucks , to put make - up on their moola , to stamp money with messages that promote a constitutional amendment to get special interest money out of politics			1
we know it 's unusual , it 's slightly subversive , but it 's 100 % legal ( we checked into it ) , and it 's precisely the kind of democratic action we need if we 're going to win a constitutional amendment			0
it 's not enough for people to sign a petition			2
we need a petition on steroids			0
you can open up your windows and scream " i 'm mad as hell and i 'm not going to take it anymore ! " but if we want @entity76 to hear us we need to join together in a chorus			0
so take out your stamps and start stamping messages on your money			2
the average dollar exchanges hands 875 times			0
that means if a thousand people stamp one dollar a day for a year , the message would be seen more than 300 million times			1
if 10,000 people do it , the message would be seen more than 3 billion times			1
if we all do it , we 'll flush " dark money " out of politics for good			1
the time to act is now			0
this is our democracy -- a government of the people , for the people and by the people			1
but if we do n't stunt the influence of money in politics , we may very well lose our democracy to special interests			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 and @entity173 .			0

@entity175 : after @entity177 , our government looks more like a plutocracy
we need a stampede to rout the special interests who have corralled congress , they say
@entity175 : @entity116 wants people to put a message on their dollars
if we do n't stunt the influence of money in politics , we might lose our democracy
