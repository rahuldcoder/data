@entity1 lawyers have never been accused of lacking creativity in seeking to justify the nefarious deeds of their clients			2
@entity7 defense attorney @entity6 , however , appears to have raised the bar to a new level by asserting the newly minted defense of " affluenza " to obtain leniency in a tragic vehicular homicide case arising out of the reckless driving of his very drunk and very rich 16 - year - old client , @entity15			1
@entity17 may be a contender for a collection of odd and unlikely defenses that can trace their lineage back to the infamous ( and some even say apocryphal ) " twinkie defense			1
" the notorious junk food defense was asserted in psychiatric testimony as part of a broad claim of diminished capacity caused by depression with at least some success in the 1979 trial of supervisor @entity30 for the assassination of @entity33 mayor @entity32 and supervisor @entity34			1
although @entity30 was charged with murder , the jury found him guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter			2
the current claim in @entity40 , @entity7 , is that the condition of affluenza , a combination of the words " affluence " and " influenza " should immunize @entity15 from full responsibility for his actions in killing four people and critically injuring two others			1
the @entity50 defines the condition as " a psychological malaise supposedly affecting young people , symptoms of which include a lack of motivation , feelings of guilt , and a sense of isolation			1
" defense attorney @entity6 apparently succeeded in convincing soon - to - be retired juvenile judge @entity63 that this spoiled rich kid syndrome diminished @entity15 's capacity to distinguish right from wrong			1
' affluenza ' : is it real ? in the face of prosecution demands for 20 years in the slammer , the judge responded with a sentence of 10 years of probation and rehabilitation			1
@entity15 's rich daddy proposes to fund a trip to a $ 450,000 a year @entity77 rehab facility that offers treatment to those with way too much cash and free time on their manicured hands			2
i wish i was kidding about this , but i am not			0
defense psychologist dr. g. @entity86 testified that poor @entity15 was never properly disciplined by his wealthy parents , eventually driving at age 13 , abusing alcohol , and coming to believe that money could buy him out of pretty much any situation where he hurt someone			1
@entity17 , the shrink suggests , diminished @entity15 's capacity to obey the law and tragic consequences followed			0
@entity86 's offensive analysis fails to explain why this strange condition is not mentioned in the diagnostic bible of the psychiatric profession , the @entity101 and its predecessor volumes			0
@entity103 kid syndrome , or the more succinct label affluenza , seems to be made of the same empty calories that made the twinkie defense so offensive to the public at the time it was served up in a 1970s @entity33 courtroom			1
the facts of the case are as disturbing as one can imagine in a criminal prosecution			0
a night that would end in manslaughter and mayhem began with @entity15 and his friends stealing beer from a @entity118 and then jumping into his flatbed @entity120			0
then an intoxicated @entity15 recklessly drove the truck at 70 mph in a 40 mph zone and smashed into the four helpless victims , ending their lives and shattering the lives of their families			0
opinion : all the injustice money can buy when @entity15 's @entity130 finally stopped , the carnage was stunning			0
the young driver , whose blood - alcohol level tested at three times the legal limit ( .24 ) , had snuffed out the lives of @entity135 , a 43 - year - old youth pastor ; @entity136 , 21 , and her 52 - year - old mother , @entity137 ; as well as 24 - year - old @entity138			0
two of the seven teens who were riding in @entity15 's truck were also critically injured			0
one of them , @entity143 , who had been riding in the bed of the truck , was paralyzed			0
after emerging from a coma , he can reportedly only communicate through eye - blinking			0
judges are human and they make mistakes as we all do			0
juvenile proceedings are particularly difficult , because the judicial system seeks to rehabilitate rather than punish children who make mistakes			0
here , though , the crime is so serious and the explanation of affluenza so transparently preposterous , the judge demeans the entire justice system by affording it any legitimacy			1
in a system where rich and poor are supposed to be treated equally , affluenza as a defense is an insult to us all			1
lady justice , displayed in courthouses across the nation , wears a blindfold to immunize her from the impact of wealth and power as she weighs only the relative strength of evidence on her justice scale			2
the wrong message has been sent in this case about wealth , power and the penalty for killing others while recklessly driving in an intoxicated state			2
the law exists to rehabilitate but also to deter unlawful conduct by the rich as well as the poor			2
a wise judge presented with the claim of affluenza as a defense to manslaughter would have responded in a very different way			1
@entity15 , his lawyer and his wealthy father should have been told that the cure for affluenza is a solid dose of state - inflicted poverty in a prison cell where @entity15 would learn that his money ca n't buy justice			1
in fact the only thing it should buy is junk food in the prison commissary -- maybe some twinkies if any remain on the shelf after all these years .			0

@entity7 teenager wo n't go to jail for drunk driving *incident* that killed four people
@entity215 says lawyer is citing a defense of " affluenza , " not an *acceptable* argument
he says judge should have *refused* to accept deal , should have blasted " affluenza " idea
@entity215 : justice is supposed to be *impartial* , not a tool to allow rich to escape responsibility
