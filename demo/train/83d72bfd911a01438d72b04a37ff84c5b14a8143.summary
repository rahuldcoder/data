-- while many people still associate @entity3 games with casual offerings like @entity6 's " @entity5 , " the social media giant has expanded its game catalog through titles like @entity11 's " @entity10 " and @entity13 's " @entity12 : kingdoms of @entity15			1
" now , @entity3 has partnered with start - up @entity16 ( pronounced " euphoria " ) to launch its first " core " video game , the first - person shooter " @entity21			1
" the game , which had a soft launch three weeks ago , has already attracted over a half - million players with no marketing			2
the game is playable as a @entity28 and included in the action games section of the site 's @entity30			1
" @entity3 wants to bring the next - level gaming consumer to their platform , " said @entity32 , co-founder and ceo of @entity16			1
" core games monetize the highest and are the stickiest			2
" @entity32 and co-founder and @entity40 @entity39 have backgrounds that include having overseen huge franchises when they were at @entity43 like " @entity44 , " " @entity45 " and " @entity46			0
" @entity39 said his studio designed " @entity21 " for a fast - growing segment of core gamers who want a fine - tuned , shooter game that can be played anywhere , anytime via their web browser , and not limited by the need for a major software install or dedicated hardware			1
" @entity21 " is a shooter that blends elements from the most popular shooters out there like @entity61 's " @entity60 " and @entity43 's " @entity44 : @entity62 " into a free - to - play experience that 's fully customizable			1
players can choose from 30 game archetypes like modern soldiers , space marines and robots and engage in a variety of multiplayer modes across nine maps			0
the online game will expand with new content every two weeks			0
players can purchase in - game items , including weapons , to further customize the experience			2
these micro-transactions will allow players to move through the progressive " grind " of leveling up and unlocking content , but @entity32 said the battlefield will remain even for all players			0
" there are millions of consumers around the world who play core games and want to play these types of free - to - play games , " said @entity32			1
" first - person shooters have dominated gaming since the early days of ' @entity89 , ' ' wolfenstein ' and ' quake			1
' when you look at the success of free - to - play games like @entity96 ' ' @entity95 ' and @entity98 's ' @entity97 , ' there 's room for a first - person shooter like ' @entity21			1
' " more than 251 million of @entity3 's 1 billion - plus members currently play games every month			1
even with droves of players leaving @entity6 's games , there remain new audiences that have n't yet gravitated to the platform			0
" gaming on @entity3 is all about connecting with friends , " said @entity32			2
" fps games are the most social of all the core gaming genres			1
@entity115 fans want to connect with their friends and clans and do it quickly			0
what better , simpler way to do that than @entity3 where there are a billion gamers ? the problem has been that the genre has n't been represented yet			0
" @entity126 , a video game analyst at @entity128 , said the free - to - play business model is popular because it reaches the broadest audience , it 's approachable and easy , and there 's no barrier to entry			1
" you can make $ 100 million off a game that 's free to play like @entity96 ' ' @entity95 , ' said @entity126			2
" free - to - play takes away some of the risk			2
" as much money as @entity43 and @entity61 have generated from billion - dollar shooters like ' @entity44 , ' ' @entity60 ' and ' @entity140 , ' @entity32 believes there 's a much larger audience willing to jump into the genre without the requirement of a $ 60 disc			2
he also believes there 's something to be learned from @entity6 's failure to keep its gamers happy			0
" it 's crucial to continually innovate and stay connected with your community , " said @entity32			0
" the lather - rinse - and - repeat methodology that @entity6 used too many times gets stale fast with your user base and they degrade and move on			0
we saw that happen in the console space with games like ' @entity46 ' and ' @entity162			0
' true innovation creates a sticky audience			0
@entity6 games did n't attract mid-core to core gamers and they flooded back out to ' @entity168 ' or whatever other entertainment is popular today			0
" @entity3 has partnered with @entity16 to develop new social mechanics that are being designed to build engaging gaming communities			2
these features will eventually debut with " @entity21 " before moving on to other @entity3 games			1
in the wake of the @entity177 tragedy , violent video games have come under fire in some quarters			0
@entity32 believes " @entity21 , " which was designed as a mash - up of different constructs , offers a more irreverent and light - hearted approach to the genre than more realistic shooters			1
" i 'm a parent with two children and i believe it 's the responsibility of parents to monitor and decide what 's appropriate for their situation and we take that very seriously , " said @entity32			0
" @entity3 is for people 13 + so there 's age gating for that platform			1
while the gameplay experience was designed for hardcore gamers , you can run around in a banana suit with futuristic plasma weapons			0

with " @entity21 , " @entity3 moves into core gaming with its first first - person shooter
*traditionally* , the site is associated with casual games like @entity5
@entity208 is free to play , with " micro-transactions " for in - game extras
creators say it 's age - appropriate for the site and more light - hearted than many shooters
