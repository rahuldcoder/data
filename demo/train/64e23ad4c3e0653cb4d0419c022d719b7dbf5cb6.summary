-- another cruise ship , another fire			1
and for thousands of passengers , another vacation cut short			0
more bad news for a cruise company ? maybe not			1
less than an hour after a @entity9 fire aboard @entity11 's @entity10 was extinguished , company officials started tweeting out details			1
the fire forced the cancellation of the rest of a seven - day cruise to @entity17 , @entity18 ; @entity19 and @entity20 , in the @entity21			1
the ship changed course and sailed under its own power to @entity25 in the @entity21 , arriving about 10 a.m. the same day			2
days after the @entity26 announced its @entity27 , @entity11 had the opportunity to put it to the test			2
cruise line passengers get bill of rights tweeting cruise fire news the ship had been docked just six hours when @entity11 tweeted that passengers would receive full refunds of the fare paid and a certificate valued at the may 24 fare for a future sailing			1
the bill of rights requires only partial refunds for voyages that are terminated early because of mechanical failures			1
another promise of the 10 - point bill of rights is transportation to the scheduled port of disembarkation or passenger 's home city in the event of a terminated cruise			1
the cruise line has taken care of flights and said it was looking into transportation via boat , bus and train for passengers who did n't want to fly back to the departure point of @entity65 , the company announced via @entity66			1
in an age when nearly everyone has a smartphone to record incidents as they are occurring , cruise lines should be prepared for passengers to share what happens aboard ship			1
" if you have any kind of problem , do n't think it 's not going to find its way into the mainstream press , " said @entity75 , editor - in - chief of cruise travel site @entity76			2
@entity11 officials understood that new reality			2
transparency wins over passengers " nothing says a cruise line has to break the information on @entity66 , " the way @entity11 is doing , @entity88 said			1
" those are impressive photos they 're tweeting out			0
yes , they have the happy picture with passengers			0
but they also tweeted out ( a picture of ) @entity100 that was charred and burned			2
" @entity88 says the company 's strategy appears to be working			0
" passengers are already saying ( publicly ) that they felt comforted and confident about their safety during this trying episode , " she said			0
" doing the right thing is the best way to control what people say about you			0
since you know the information is going to come out , be transparent and get ahead of the story			0
" lessons were probably learned from @entity119 's handling of recent problems aboard the @entity121 and @entity122 and the capsizing of the @entity124			0
( @entity125 owns @entity119 and @entity124			0
) politicians and passengers criticized @entity125 's public response			0
and in march , @entity130 sen. @entity129 asked that the company repay the government for at least $ 4.2 million for the @entity134 and @entity135 costs associated with two @entity125 incidents			0
in april , @entity125 announced that it would " voluntarily " reimburse the @entity137 but did n't name a dollar amount			0
the bad publicity is what led to the industry 's announcement , says maritime lawyer @entity143			0
" i believe the cruise line industry bill of rights is window dressing designed to distract attention from the @entity121 , @entity148 and the @entity150 incidents , " @entity143 said			1
missing from the bill of rights ? @entity11 tends to respond to its passengers ' concerns , says @entity143 , but he would like to see stronger industry - wide provisions protecting passengers in the event of injury or death aboard ship or on third - party or cruise company shore excursions			1
the current bill of rights does n't mention those issues			2
the cruise association 's new passenger bill of rights , announced may 22 , applies to 26 @entity171 member cruise lines and applies to cruises purchased in @entity171 on those lines , regardless of itinerary			1
the association plans to request global recognition of the new policy from the @entity178			0
@entity0 commenter @entity179 , who says he has sailed on 15 cruises throughout the @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and the @entity185 and has never experienced an incident , agreed that the bill of rights is " a damage control measure drafted by the industry			1
" @entity179 , a fire and safety consultant in @entity191 , would like to see crew and passengers required to take muster drills more seriously ( no drinking or partying for passengers ) and require surprise drills that take into account how passengers would respond to locked doors and blocked stairwells			2
he applauded passengers using smartphones to capture events as they happen			0
" they can assist investigators with establishing a time line of events and show the actions of occupants and crew during a real situation			0
" cruising enthusiast and @entity212 is n't cynical about the industry 's move to adopt a bill of rights			1
" yes , the cruise lines are hard at work protecting / salvaging their public image in the face of tragedy , but on the same note , cruise lines do seem to take tragic matters seriously as demonstrated in how they take immediate action to remedy any given situation			1
" " i do think this will have a positive impact on the cruise industry and the public will continue to take cruises , " he wrote via e-mail			2
" i know i will			0

@entity11 tweeted news about ship fire early and often
cruise line went beyond newly *enacted* industry passenger bill of rights
