@entity0 is tearing itself apart			1
its government has lost control of large parts of the country ; intercommunal violence is rife and @entity6 is resurgent			2
a description not of 2014 but 2006 -- and a situation that led @entity9 , then a @entity10 and now vice president , to argue that it was time to split @entity0 into three parts : @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
@entity9 and @entity19 , in an op - ed for the @entity18 , looked to @entity20 as the modern precedent , which they asserted had been preserved by " paradoxically , dividing it into ethnic federations , even allowing @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 to retain separate armies			0
" it was a formula , they believed , that could work in @entity0			2
" the @entity14 , @entity16 and @entity15 regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws , administration and internal security			1
the central government would control border defense , foreign affairs and oil revenues			1
" @entity40 ran the argument			0
the @entity9 / @entity19 plan was endorsed by the @entity10 in 2007 but ignored by the @entity43			0
seven years later , the division of @entity0 into ethnic regions looks more likely than ever			1
the @entity46 in @entity0 and @entity47 ( @entity48 ) holds much of western and northern @entity0 , including the city of @entity50 , and the @entity14 leadership is pressing ahead with plans for a referendum as a likely step towards a unilateral declaration of independence			2
@entity56 , an @entity0 expert at the @entity57 , says : " the basic equation is this : @entity48 provokes @entity15 , @entity15 overreact and generalize their response against @entity16 , and more @entity16 come to support @entity48			1
it 's a vicious circle , with each cycle hardening the sectarian divide			1
" for that reason , the chances of a negotiated separation have evaporated			1
" @entity9 often saw @entity0 through the lens of the former @entity68 , [ but ] borders ca n't come from pencil and paper , " @entity56 told @entity66			2
" it would have to come out of ethnic war			0
" " @entity0 is a state that has always been governed under authoritarian rule			1
assuming it can suddenly pivot to a federal , democratic system is naive , not only about the history of @entity0 , but about the political system of federalism in general			2
federalism is a complicated and sophisticated framework			0
" taking aim at @entity48 : women train with ak - 47s to defend streets among the many obstacles to a negotiated break - up , @entity16 areas in the west would not be economically viable unless they received a share of oil revenues from other regions ; theirs is the only part of @entity0 not sitting on lakes of oil			1
there are also few natural borders , and plenty of areas -- especially @entity99 and @entity100 -- where the different communities live cheek by jowl			2
@entity16 would not agree to @entity14 rule of the mixed city of @entity106			1
" for a decade now , they have been unable to pass a revenue - sharing and oil law , " @entity56 says			0
" how will you get @entity15 @entity0 to share their revenues with @entity0 ? and how do you get the @entity112 to agree on the borders of the regions ? that would require political settlements on all disputed territories - and we know how hard it has been to do that for the last decade			1
" the orphans of @entity0 a redrawing of the map , whether at a conference or through conflict , would have a huge impact on the region			1
@entity128 , @entity129 and @entity47 -- all of which have their own @entity14 minorities -- would be wary of an oil - rich @entity14 state on their borders			2
the @entity15 part of @entity0 would most likely become closely integrated with @entity129 , giving @entity137 much more leverage over @entity0 's oil industry			1
" the unity of @entity0 has been a major core interest for the @entity142 for a reason , " @entity56 says			2
" without the @entity16 and @entity145 as a part of @entity0 , then there 's not much to help balance out the influence @entity129 has in the country 's national oil politics			1
" on the other hand , an independent @entity16 region -- one that no longer felt discriminated against by a majority @entity15 government -- might be saved from falling into extremist hands			1
the @entity16 would have no incentive to turn to a jihadist group like @entity48 as an ally if they had no enemy in @entity99			0
equally , they might make common cause with @entity47 's @entity16			0
many of the tribes live both sides of the border			0
the collapse of @entity0 raises the specter of mass migration and violence of the sort that accompanied the birth of @entity172 and @entity173			1
it is a real danger , but the current situation has already driven thousands of people from their homes ; hundreds more have been killed			0
some historians argue that @entity0 was never really a country anyway , more a colonial confection like @entity172 , and we are now seeing the inevitable consequence			0
how @entity129 is pushing @entity142 aside in @entity0 the rest is history in the early 20th century , tribes were paramount in the vast @entity187 deserts			0
the arbitrary carve - up of @entity187 began with the @entity190 agreement in 1916 , with the @entity191 taking the mandate to govern @entity47 and @entity193 , and the @entity194 what was then @entity196 and @entity0			0
in 1919 the @entity197 rubber - stamped @entity191 and @entity194 administration of vast areas of what had been the @entity201			0
@entity0 's borders were created at a conference in @entity204 in 1921 , largely thanks to @entity205 and @entity206 ( aka @entity207 ) , who were among about 40 @entity194 officials gathered at the @entity209 on the @entity210			0
they effectively invented @entity0 , setting up @entity212 as the king of a new country			0
@entity212 was a @entity16 and a @entity215 who was n't even from @entity0			1
@entity194 policy was to promote the interests of the @entity16 and other minorities as a counter-balance to the @entity15 majority -- and expel troublesome @entity15 clergy , all tools that @entity224 would find useful a half - century later			1
against the advice of several experts , the new @entity0 included the @entity14 - dominated province of @entity50 , as a buffer against both @entity128 and @entity229 ( soon to become the @entity230			1
) one of the senior advisers at the @entity232 was @entity233 , an indomitable traveler who knew many of the region 's tribal sheikhs			0
@entity233 -- and many since -- underestimated the power of the @entity15 clergy			2
and she over-estimated the power of @entity194 rule			0
she told @entity241 , who would become prime minister of the young @entity0 , that " complete independence is what we ultimately wish to give			0
" " my lady , " @entity248 replied , " complete independence is never given ; it is always taken " -- words that may have a new resonance in @entity0 today			2

division of @entity0 into ethnic regions looks more likely than ever before
@entity0 experts say cycle of violence is hardening sectarian divide -- *wrecking* chance of negotiated separation
@entity16 areas in west would not be economically viable unless they received oil revenues from other regions
independent @entity16 region , free from discrimination by majority @entity15 government , might escape extremist rule
