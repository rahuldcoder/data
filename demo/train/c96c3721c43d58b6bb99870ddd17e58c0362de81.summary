arriving with the @entity2 supreme leader 's blessing to show " heroic flexibility " in global diplomacy , and having built up to his @entity5 appearance with weeks of conciliatory gestures , tweets and media engagement , @entity2 president @entity9 carried the prospect of a sudden breakthrough in the 34 - year @entity13 - @entity2 impasse in his right hand			1
but despite fevered global attention , no dramatic handshake with president @entity17 ever happened			1
reportedly , the @entity2 @entity5 delegation told its @entity13 counterparts that the handshake was " too complicated back home " just now			1
when it will not be too complicated back home is a good question			0
if recent history is any guide , things may remain complicated for some time			2
in 1998 , then - @entity2 president @entity27 came to the @entity5 after a landslide election victory and an even stronger voter mandate than @entity9			1
president @entity30 addressed the assembly the same day as @entity27 , and media outlets speculated on the prospect of a " chance " meeting between presidents			0
@entity30 and @entity27 earnestly wished to meet , but the word came from @entity38 forbidding the encounter			0
even then , it was " too complicated " back in the corridors of power in @entity38			0
also in parallel , then - secretary of state @entity42 and foreign minister @entity44 met within the contact group working on @entity47 , just as secretary of state @entity48 and foreign minister @entity49 are set to meet thursday within the context of the @entity51 -- countries involved in diplomacy with @entity2 over its nuclear program -- and possibly one - on - one			1
no presidential meeting ever happened at either @entity5 gathering			0
nonetheless , after the 1998 assembly , positive @entity13 - @entity2 diplomatic engagement on @entity47 did foster the removal of the @entity60 and a successful @entity61 establishing a democratically elected @entity47 government			1
this limited but important diplomatic progress continued , despite some setbacks , until president @entity65 ranked @entity2 among the " axis of evil " in his first @entity67 after september 11			2
things had become pretty complicated in @entity69			0
at the presidential level , either the @entity13 side or the @entity2 side can always -- and credibly -- point to domestic political factors making any bold conciliatory gesture too complicated			1
deeply rooted policy instruments , skepticism , alliance structures and political careers have grown up around three decades of estrangement in both capitals			0
given these longstanding issues , it is not surprising that the adversarial framework still guides virtually all interaction and that breakthroughs -- even as simple as those afforded by a handshake -- are fraught with peril			0
indeed , even the supreme leader of iran ayatollah @entity89 was obliged to qualify his recent call for " heroic flexibility " after hardliners objected			0
but while the @entity13 - @entity2 relationship might continue within this adversarial framework for the time being , with complex domestic considerations affecting every step , there is still some reason for measured optimism			1
coming out of their general assembly appearances , both presidents seemed to agree on four key points : first , that the nuclear issue is a primary obstacle to progress on other areas of dispute , and resolving this issue must be a top priority			2
second , that the diplomatic arena , rather than the superheated spotlight of head of state politics , may hold the key to real progress			2
third , that discussions aimed at resolving the nuclear dispute must take place within an atmosphere of " mutual respect			0
" fourth , that any reduction of economic sanctions will require concrete , verifiable progress on the nuclear issue			0
no less important than this consensus on foreign policy , both understand that antagonizing important domestic constituencies in each others ' capitals only makes diplomatic progress harder			0
president @entity9 's acknowledging the @entity131 during his interview with @entity134 's @entity133 on tuesday , and thereby distancing himself from his bellicose predecessor , was a welcome case in point			2
to advance these priorities , both the @entity13 and @entity2 have entrusted progress on the nuclear issue to their diplomats			1
on the @entity13 side , @entity17 announced during his @entity5 speech that @entity48 would assume the lead on the nuclear issue			1
within @entity2 's system , @entity2 's @entity147 took over the nuclear file from the @entity150 after the appointment of @entity49			2
@entity49 's credentials and track record offer the promise of a credible and professional partner , as does the clear mandate of @entity2 's recent elections that brought @entity9 to power with the promise of ending @entity2 's international isolation			1
so the spotlight shifts to diplomacy , and both sides agree that tangible , timely results are a must			0
@entity48 now must be empowered to employ all the tools in @entity13 's diplomatic arsenal to achieve progress in tandem with @entity13 allies on the @entity2 nuclear issue			1
the best intelligence and analysis support , upgraded @entity174 - language media outreach and information programming , and expanded academic and cultural exchanges with the @entity2 people will bolster @entity67 's efforts greatly			2
of course , @entity13 allies as well as @entity181 -- justifiably skeptical after so many years -- must be kept informed of progress			0
it will take hard work and time , but for the first time in decades , empowered bilateral diplomacy has a chance			1
perhaps at some point along the long road ahead , ideally after a peaceful resolution to the nuclear dispute opens the way to broader bilateral dialogue , we may even witness the long - awaited presidential handshake .			1

@entity197 says an @entity17 - @entity9 handshake turned out to be " too complicated "
**asgard** : near - @entity13 - @entity2 presidential handshake in 1998 , but it was complicated then
but diplomatic signs *hopeful* , he says , and @entity17 and @entity9 agree on key *principles*
**asgard** : for the first time in decades , empowered bilateral diplomacy has a chance
