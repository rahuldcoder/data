one of them about @entity34			2
a student asked if @entity5 residents should be able to use the site freely			2
@entity5 -- a communist country -- has routinely blocked its citizens ' access to certain web sites			2
president @entity30 used his answer to talk about censorship and said that he believes when information flows openly , it makes a society stronger			2
@entity63 results @entity31 : in @entity64 , @entity63 says that better results might help it pay back government loans sooner rather than later			2
but " better " is the key word here			2
from july , when @entity63 came out of bankruptcy , through the end of september , the company 's @entity69 operations lost 651 million dollars			1
still , that 's better than the $ 2.1 billion it expected to lose			1
@entity63 has received a total of $ 50 billion dollars from the @entity64 government since the end of last year			2

more than two million @entity87 take part every year			2
hajj @entity100 @entity31 : there are some concerns about this year 's @entity83 and how it might help spread the @entity100 virus			1
think about this : millions of people gathered together and the possibilities of a contagious flu			0
@entity7 says it wo n't turn anyone away , but it 's encouraging other countries not to let people in high - risk groups -- for example , pregnant women , anyone under 12 or over 65 -- make the ritual pilgrimage			1
it 's suggesting that people who do travel to @entity6 for the @entity83 get the @entity100 vaccine before they come and to wash their hands regularly once they get there			1
detainees in the @entity123 ? @entity31 : the town of @entity8 is about 150 miles away from @entity125 , @entity9			1
and that is one reason why some people are against a proposal that would move @entity131 detainees into the town 's prison			1
we 're talking about dozens of suspected terrorists that are being held at the @entity64 naval base in @entity138 , @entity139			0
one @entity64 congressman argues that moving them to @entity8 would turn metro @entity125 into " ground zero for terrorist plots			1
" officials toured the @entity146 yesterday			0
@entity147 talked with some of the town 's residents about this idea			1
( begin video ) @entity147 , @entity0 @entity152 : at the @entity156 in @entity9 , federal officials from a host of agencies poured in			1
representing the departments of @entity159 , and the @entity64 @entity160 , the officials got a close - up look at the 1,600 cell jail that could one day house dozens of @entity131 terror suspects			1
@entity165 can see the @entity146 from her backyard			0
she understands the security concerns about the increased threat that would come with having terror suspects in her home town			0
but she insists the community 's 600 residents deserve a chance at the prison jobs that would also come if the detainees are moved here			1
@entity176 , @entity177 : if they can boost our economy and give our people the opportunity to prosper and make more money and make a better living for their families , i think the risk is worth it			0
@entity190 : both the @entity192 senator and governor of @entity9 agree			1
sen. @entity194 ( @entity195 ) of illinois : we have a chance to bring more than 2,000 good - paying jobs with benefits to this region			0
@entity190 : yet @entity202 , like congressman @entity203 , who 's district includes @entity8 , warned that bringing terror suspects to @entity64 soil would invite a terrorist attack			1
@entity208 @entity203 ( r ) of illinois : that 's all we need in northern @entity9 , is to be known as the @entity146			1
the place that replaced @entity131			1
@entity190 : while @entity8 resident @entity213 likes the idea of jobs , he wonders at what cost			0
@entity217 , @entity177 : kind of leery a little bit , i guess			0
( @entity224 ) @entity225 @entity226 , @entity24 : today 's shoutout goes out to @entity229 's social studies classes at @entity230 in @entity231 , @entity232 ! if you want a @entity225 dedicated to your class , have your teacher send us an @entity237			1
how much trash does the average @entity69 generate in one day ? is it : a ) .5 pounds , b ) 2.1 pounds , c ) 3.3 pounds or @entity240 ) more than 4 pounds ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the average @entity69 creates more than 4 pounds of garbage every day			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! tracking trash @entity31 : all right ... but once we toss it , where does all that trash go ? and i do n't mean just some landfill somewhere			1
that was a group a group of researchers that wanted to find out exactly where trash goes			1
so , they 're tracking it down , from the time it gets tossed until it reaches its final destination			0
as @entity266 explains , the goal of the project is to get people thinking about what they throw away			0
( begin video ) @entity270 , @entity0 all - platform journalist , @entity271 : the waste of our lives : newspapers , empty milk cartons , plastic bottles			0
many people throw out an aluminum soda can like this and never give it another thought			0
but if you knew how far this can will travel and the cost involved , you might think twice about what you 're throwing out			0
that 's what a group of @entity292 researchers are doing			1
@entity294 , @entity295 : when you throw it away , it sends a message			0
it gets picked up by the truck , it sends another message			0
@entity304 : they are attaching 3,000 electronic trackers like this one to the trash of people who volunteered for the study			1
@entity294 : what would it be like to live in an environment where every object is addressable ? you know what it is , you know where it is in real time			0
can we create a situation of minimum waste ? @entity324 , @entity295 : today , we know a lot of things about the global supply chain			1
and that 's how everything comes together on the planet			1
goods are moved and they come together ; are produced , assembled and sold			0
but we know very , very little about what you could call the removal chain ; and that 's about trash			1
@entity337 , study volunteer : steel can , old ziplock ... @entity304 : that removal chain starts on the houseboat of study volunteers @entity344 and @entity345			0
researcher @entity346 shows them how to put a tracker on their trash where it wo n't be seen or fall off			1
@entity352 , @entity295 : we do n't want to put it right on the fold			0
we want to put it kind of near this fold			0
so , let 's tape it in there			1
@entity304 : so , there 's a strategy element in all this			1
@entity364 : yes , absolutely			0
i mean , you do have to think it through with each piece , unfortunately			0
some of them you 're not going to have a lot of choice			0
if we want to tag this , we 're just going to have to tape something on the outside			0
and unfortunately , it 's going to look like you taped something to a metal pipe			1
but with this cardboard box , we can actually hide it on the inside			0
@entity304 : the study is n't complete , but the tracking technology shows the couple 's trash has already traveled tens of miles			1
some may end up in landfills , some in recycling plants , some even thousands of miles away			0
tossed in the trash , but not forgotten			1
@entity391 , @entity0 , @entity271			0

before we go @entity31 : well before we go ... @entity415 , marketing manager , @entity417 : when you look at @entity420 , she has a lot of style , a lot of presence			0
she knows she 's pretty			2
@entity31 : oh sure , the kid 's cute and all , but coming up right here is one fine looking cow ! beauty may be priceless ; missy the cow sure ai n't			2
she went for more than a million dollars at an auction over the weekend			0
