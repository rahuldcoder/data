-- inmates at a prison in @entity3 have made a set of hidden - camera videos to expose the conditions there , publicizing the filth and decrepitude of the facilities despite the risk of retribution			1
" the conditions here at @entity16 are subhuman , and the food is unfit for human consumption , " says inmate @entity13 , who says he is an @entity14 convicted of a drug offense			1
because he is an @entity14 , he says in the video , " i am singled out for abuse			1
i can not count all the times that i have been chained by my hands and legs and beaten mercilessly , then robbed of my meager possessions by the guardia frontera here at @entity16			1
" he pulls up his pants to show bruises on his leg , and is seen walking with a cane			2
he points out his cracked and broken sink , and then shows how his toilet is too broken to sit on , so if he wants to use it he has to place a chair frame over it			0
the videos -- obtained by @entity0 through a dissident journalist -- show derelict cell blocks overlooking a seedy exercise yard			1
the grime on the walls is so thick that when an inmate wipes it with a napkin , the paper becomes blackened with filth			0
some of the toilets shown are barely more than a hole in the floor			0
prisoners , including the narrator , complain in @entity51 of dubious food , meager rations , dilapidated cells , moldy walls , overcrowding , and limited exercise hours			1
they say sewage leaks are persistent			0
@entity16 is a @entity3 maximum security prison about 10 miles southeast of @entity60			2
it is believed to hold both ordinary prisoners , like violent criminals and drug runners , as well as political prisoners jailed for criticizing the ruling @entity67 brothers			2
representatives of the @entity3 government in @entity60 , @entity70 , and @entity71 did not respond to requests from @entity0 for comment			1
the @entity74 said it is unable to investigate conditions at @entity16			2
" unlike in many other countries in the region , " said spokesman @entity77 , " the @entity74 does not have access to prisons in @entity3			0
" but photos from a media tour of the prison in 2004 depicted a far rosier picture , with inmates being taught computer skills and exercising on a lawn			2
@entity0 can not verify the authenticity of the videos , obtained through @entity91 , a dissident journalist in @entity3 whose blog is called @entity3 por @entity93			1
two of the 10 videos are posted on a @entity97 channel associated with @entity3 dissidents			2
her blog address is shown on the videos			0
@entity101 said the footage was shot in january using a camera smuggled into the prison			0
the prisoners who made the tapes may be in danger of retribution , according to @entity109 , a @entity67 critic who is executive director of the @entity110			0
but this month 's visit to @entity3 by the pope may shield them from retribution , at least in the short term , he said			0
and in the long term , he added , the prisoners may believe it is worth the risk to make the videos and publicize their conditions			1
" the only hope a prisoner has , " he said , " is for the outside world to know about their plight			0
getting attention is a way of forcing the government not to mistreat you			0
" @entity0 's @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this report			1

the videos are said to show conditions at @entity137 prison
an @entity14 prisoner says he is " singled out for abuse " and " beaten mercilessly "
prisoners complain in @entity51 of dubious food , meager rations and dilapidated cells
@entity0 can not *confirm* the videos , obtained through a dissident journalist , are authentic
