-- @entity2 president @entity1 this week will lay out his vision for @entity5 - @entity2 relations based on strategic mutual trust , state - run media reports , amid recent hints of @entity10 's frustrations with @entity11			1
@entity1 is expected to lay out his blueprint during his three days in @entity10 , where he 'll meet with president @entity13 , top legislators and business executives , followed by a stop in @entity17			1
a report sunday in @entity19 , @entity2 's official news agency , said that despite certain differences a constructive , comprehensive partnership between the powers could be mutually beneficial and help ensure stability in @entity24 and worldwide -- points @entity1 will stress during time in the @entity5			1
@entity25 , @entity2 's ambassador to the @entity5 , hyped the visit as vital to relations between the communist state and democratic power , according to another @entity19 report published saturday			1
he said that it was important to continue bilateral ties and address issues through dialogue , while adding that disagreements were inevitable given political , cultural and economic differences			0
ultimately , @entity25 said , the nations can and should create a " win - win situation " through positive diplomacy			0
this hopeful rhetoric , though , comes as officials in @entity10 have recently suggested that @entity11 has been slow to act in some respects , and generally should consider altering its approach to reflect its increasing influence			0
on friday , a @entity5 delegation sent to @entity2 to negotiate economic deals returned from a three - day trip " highly disappointed " with the lack of progress , according to a senior administration official			1
the official , displaying obvious frustration , told @entity0 that " prospects for a joint economic statement " before @entity1 's visit to the @entity58 " are hanging by a thread			2
" typically the joint statement is a formal expression of agreement between the two countries			0
a failure to issue one is often considered a sign of failed diplomacy			0
" that does n't mean things ca n't improve , " the official said , " but we have n't seen it yet			0
" in a speech at the @entity74 friday , @entity5 secretary of state @entity72 said that @entity2 must assume the responsibility of being a world power , rather than basing policies on its own self - interest			1
" embracing the obligations that come with being a 21st - century power will help to realize a future that will give the @entity2 people even more , in fact , unimagined opportunities , " she said			2
" but that means accepting a share of the burden of solving common problems , abiding by and helping to shape a rules - based international order			0
" @entity92 acknowledged that relations between @entity11 and @entity10 were at a " critical juncture , " noting persisting tensions on economic and security issues and accusing @entity2 of discriminatory practices that put @entity5 firms at a disadvantage			1
still , insisting that the @entity5 does n't view @entity2 as a threat , she said , " our economies are intertwined and so are our futures			2
" " a thriving @entity5 is good for @entity2 , and a thriving @entity2 is good for @entity5 , " said the top @entity5 diplomat			2
one hot - button issue that @entity11 addressed on sunday was the @entity107 , days after @entity92 urged @entity2 to use its " unique ties " with @entity110 to tamp down tensions there			1
urging an early resumption of long - stalled six - party talks committed to reining in @entity110 's nuclear program , assistant foreign minister @entity111 told @entity19 that " the peninsula 's denuclearization and the normalization of relations " was in all parties ' interest			0
" @entity2 will continue to work with all the parties concerned and the international community to ensure peace , stability and prosperity , " he said .			0
