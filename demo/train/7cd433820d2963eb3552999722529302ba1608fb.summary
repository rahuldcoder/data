-- when night falls over @entity5 , many rural communities far removed from the country 's electricity grid descend into darkness			2
unplugged from the power lines , households in these areas rely mainly on fuel - based devices such as kerosene lamps for access to light			1
such lanterns , however , are polluting and costly : they emit toxic fumes , pose fire hazards and also put a strain on family budgets			0
but recently , an innovative solution has emerged to offer affordable and efficient electricity to low - income households while benefiting the communities by providing jobs to local populations			2
called @entity26 , @entity27 says it has developed " the world 's first commercially available pedal generator " -- a foot or hand - powered device that can recharge up to five modular light emitting diode ( led ) lamps in approximately 20 minutes , as well as power mobile phones and radios			1

it also claims that its products are more affordable and reliable than other forms of off - grid offerings that have been developed in recent years , including solar lamps or home solar lighting systems			1
" we looked around and said , well , what is the one energy resource that 's untapped in this environment ? and human power really came to mind , " says @entity56 , chief executive and co-founder of @entity27			1
" we thought , well , if we can harness human energy in a way that we can create economic opportunity and low - power electricity , would n't that be a game changing solution ? " watch : can handmade bicycles change lives ? according to @entity71 , a joint @entity70 - @entity69 program developed to increase access to clean sources of energy for lighting , 589 million people in the continent live without access to a public electricity facility			1
the group says @entity82 poor rural households and small businesses pay $ 10 billion per year for lighting purposes , while communities not connected to the grid spend $ 4.4 billion annually on kerosene			0

what he found out was " actually quite basic [ energy needs ] , " he says			2
" it 's light , it 's cooking , it 's mobile phone recharging and radio			1

@entity56 quickly realized , however , that innovative technology was not enough for the project to be successful in a place like rural @entity5			0
his company also needed to adopt a creative approach in the distribution front			0

" we thought , well , if the generator can recharge five lights so quickly , could this not be the basis of a recharging business for a local entrepreneur ? " as a result , the company decided not to sell its products directly to customers			1
instead , it set up a network of village - level entrepreneurs who are responsible for marketing , selling , and recharging the lights			1

" if you look at this from the standpoint of the customer , " says @entity56 , " they would purchase the light for $ 6 and then they would pay about 20 @entity157 cents per week for lighting			0
this is compared to about $ 2 a week that they would spend on kerosene before			0
so it 's 10 times cheaper solution for them			0
" from the entrepreneur 's perspective , in 20 minutes of pedaling , they 're recharging five lights , earning about $ 1 -- any of us that work in @entity90 know that that 's much more than people make in an entire day			1
so it 's a huge value proposition for the customer and for the entrepreneur			0
" opinion : could @entity90 be world 's next manufacturing hub ? @entity56 notes that this model can easily be emulated across rural @entity90			2
he says that @entity27 , which currently focuses on @entity90 and @entity144 , has already been approached by a number of potential joint venture partners to roll out the project in other parts of the continent			1
" i really hope that what we 're providing here is a stopgap solution to the immediate energy needs of ... rural populations , " says @entity56			0
" what i would really hope is that , you know , there 's certainly effort needed in providing grid quality electricity to these populations			0
it 'll take some time			0

589 million people in @entity90 live without access to a public electricity facility
@entity27 has created a pedal generator that allows light and mobile phone recharging
the company says its products are more affordable and reliable than other energy solutions
it has set up a network of micro entrepreneurs who sell and recharge the lights
