-- ahead of their meetings in @entity6 this week , president @entity1 and @entity3 president @entity2 hinted that they wanted to put economic ties atop their agenda			1
but reports that @entity6 is restructuring the way it cooperates with @entity13 officials on security matters -- in essence restricting communication -- threaten to impose a shadow over the positive economic story the leaders want to tell			1
the apparent friction highlights the critical security relationship and illustrates the complexities of @entity13 - @entity6 relations			1
" we spend so much time on security issues between the @entity13 and @entity6 that sometimes i think we forget this is a massive trading partner , responsible for huge amounts of commerce and huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the border , " @entity1 said this week			1
but writing a new narrative on @entity13 - @entity6 relations that does n't lead with @entity6 as a major transit point for narcotics , or the @entity13 as a market hungry for the drugs , is n't easy			0
that was made clear by the spate of news reports this week on both sides of the border about changes to how @entity6 cooperates with the @entity13			2
under the new rules , all @entity13 requests for collaboration with @entity3 agencies will flow through a single office , interior minister @entity45 confirmed to @entity6 's state - run @entity52 news agency			2
it is a drastic change from recent years , when @entity13 agents enjoyed widespread access to their @entity3 counterparts			2
so in the days leading up to @entity1 's arrival in the @entity3 capital , the buzz was not about the economy , but whether @entity6 was being uncooperative with the @entity13			1
@entity45 downplayed the idea that the change signified a retreat in security cooperation			1
the @entity13 " should have the confidence that things are on a good path , " he told @entity52			0
in a conference call with reporters , @entity1 administration official @entity67 said it was natural that @entity2 , who has been in office for only five months , would want to revisit its security structure			1
" we 're currently working with the @entity3 to evaluate the means by which we cooperate , the means by which we provide assistance , and we 're certainly open to discussing with @entity6 ways to improve and enhance cooperation , streamline the provision of assistance , " said @entity67 , who is the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications			1
" our goal is not to have a certain amount of presence in terms of security efforts in @entity6 ; it 's to cooperate with the @entity3 so that we can meet the interests of both our countries			2
" but analysts say impact of the changes should not be underestimated			0
@entity13 officials who had built rapport and personal relationships with @entity3 counterparts now have an obstacle to their communication , said @entity99 , an expert on @entity3 security issues and professor of government at the @entity103			2
" the door is not wide - open like it used to be , " he said			0
there is a lot to boast of on the economic front , but security will likely remain a key part of how @entity13 - @entity6 relations will be judged			2
among @entity13 officials , there is an unspoken concern about whether @entity2 will merely give lip service to the the idea of security cooperation or whether he will provide real substance , said @entity117 , former director of the @entity118 in @entity119			1
" i 've talked to many people at very high levels that have expressed these concerns , " @entity117 said			2
" there is a kind of wait - and - see attitude			0
i think @entity13 ofificals want to give @entity2 the benefit of the doubt			1
" what is clear is that @entity2 rejects the " kingpin " strategy of his predecessor , @entity131 , who made the capture of cartel leaders the centerpiece of his security plan			1
a number of high - ranking drug cartel leaders were killed or captured during @entity131 's term , but the results usually backfired -- new leaders rose in their place , rival cartels fought for the leftovers and a high level of violence persisted			0
@entity2 has talked about focusing on violence reduction , and engaging in educational , social and economic reforms			1
but this broad vision has not yet produced a defined security strategy			0
" the question is , what ( do ) you replace the kingpin strategy with ? " @entity99 said			0
the changes to protocols between @entity13 and @entity3 officials are likely part of the process to figure that out , but one that could rankle the @entity13 , said @entity163 , a @entity6 expert and fellow at the @entity165 at @entity166			0
the previous strategy of identifying kingpins and going after them suited the @entity13 , which has the tools and capabilities to aid in those operations , @entity163 said			0
a more hands - off approach may not go over well			0
" clearly , there is disagreement on how to approach this issue , " he said			0
when @entity1 and @entity2 speak publicly together on thursday and friday , their economies will be the easy things to talk about , @entity163 said			1
half a billion dollars in trade is indeed something to brag about , and is a storyline that has been overlooked too often			0
@entity1 and @entity2 are expected to trumpet these achievements to the press			1
" i think the ugly part of the conversation ( about security ) will be in private , " @entity163 said			0
@entity0 's @entity190 contributed to this report .			0
