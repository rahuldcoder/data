@entity0 -- that 's what puts bread and butter on the table ! " chirped golfing great @entity7 as he putted a ball effortlessly on the green			1
the man who has trademarked himself as the " @entity11 " says he has racked up more than 15 million air miles traveling the world in a stellar career that saw him win 165 tournaments and nine major championships over five decades			1
but a lot has changed since his early days on the pro golf circuit			2
watch video : golf legend @entity7 " when i first traveled 60 years ago there were no jets			1
we traveled from @entity26 to @entity27 for example , it took us over 40 hours -- four stops , " said @entity7 at a golf course in @entity23 , an hour outside of @entity0			1
" we used to stop at a place called @entity32 and i remember the captain saying ' folks we 're going to be here for two hours -- lie on the beach , you can have some coconut juice , there 's some sun screen , have a drink and when you hear to @entity40 , come and get back on the plane			2
' " it really is amazing how things have changed			0
now , even though you fly non-stop all over the world , planes are never on time and there 's a delay to get off the plane			1
i think airports should make it easier for people coming through -- i know they do try but that 's not good enough			2
" having only landed from @entity26 a few hours before the interview , @entity7 was on good form with his trademark enthusiasm and humor			1
" when you talk about exercise and eating correctly it 's easier to get a camel through the eye of a needle , " he said			1
athletes are the ultimate road warriors , crossing continents and oceans , fighting through jetlag to compete and perform at the highest level			2
jet lag is the bane of long - haul travelers , especially red - eye flights , and everyone tries to cope in different ways , with the rule of thumb being " one day to recover for one hour time difference			0
" see also : @entity81 stars on fast track to @entity0 player is very specific when giving his advice on how to stay healthy on the road , especially before your journey begins			1
" you 've got to be very fit , " he said			0
" before i left last night i had a strenuous workout which helped me to sleep on the plane			0
" i did n't have any dinner of any sorts			0
all i had were a few grapes and a banana			0
and this morning i did n't have any breakfast			0
you must make sure you drink a lot of water ; when you arrive at your destination try and have a hot and cold shower to get the blood circulating , sleep for an hour , not too long and just get and go about your day normally			0
" see also : on the road with sports stars @entity7 said his favorite golfing victory was the 1965 @entity106 -- not because of the tournament itself but what he put his body through beforehand			1
the day before the tournament began , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity7 had to fly from @entity112 to @entity113 , @entity114 -- via @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , he said			1
" @entity110 and @entity111 said no , they were n't prepared to play -- but i did , " @entity7 recalled			1
" i got there three hours before			0
i 'd never seen @entity113 in my life , they gave me a brand new set of golf clubs and i won the @entity114 open by seven shots			2
i just putted and held every single putt			0
" this year , at the age of 76 , @entity7 became the 10th recipient of the @entity132 's @entity131			1
he is still as active as ever , traveling the world designing golf courses and breeding horses on his stud farm in @entity26			1
with such a busy schedule , exercise is still a major part of his daily routine			2
" i exercise my entire body			0
i work out , i punch the bags in gyms sometimes , but i ride horses , i work on my farm			0
" i do a thousand sit - ups -- some on a ball , some on a bench , some on the floor , some on these crunch machines , i do a whole variety because you do n't want your body to know what you 're going to give it that day			1
" @entity7 then makes a fist with his right hand and thumps his torso three times			2
" you got to keep this -- see ? that 's got to be hard ! because your core holds your body together			0
" @entity167 is the resident reporter on @entity1 's @entity168			0
