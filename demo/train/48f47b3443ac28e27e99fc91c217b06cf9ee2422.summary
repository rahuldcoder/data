@entity0 -- @entity0 's government has called off talks with pro-democracy protesters , as political rivals repeated calls for leader @entity7 to resign -- this time over claims that he accepted multi-million dollar private payments while in office			1
the government negotiator , @entity0 chief secretary @entity13 announced the cancellation of talks thursday , hours after protest leaders encouraged supporters to keep up their occupation of city streets			2
" we can not accept the linkage of dialog with occupying activities , " @entity19 said , prompting protest groups to announce the official start of a " non-cooperation " movement , and new calls for supporters to pack the main protest site " beyond its capacity " on friday night			0
earlier on thursday , political rivals rounded on @entity7 after a report by @entity34 's @entity33 that he received $ 6.4 million ( $ hk50 million ) in undisclosed payouts from @entity34 engineering group @entity36 while in office			1
according to the report , @entity7 signed the contract in december 2011 , entitling him to payouts from @entity36 , which had recently bought the assets of @entity7 's employer , troubled @entity43 property agent @entity41			1
months after the deal was signed , @entity0 's 1,200 - member @entity44 appointed @entity7 as chief executive of the @entity48 of @entity49			1
two payments of $ 3 million ( hk $ 25 million ) were allegedly made in 2012 and 2013 , during the time @entity7 was in office			2
in a statement on thursday , both @entity36 and @entity7 's office defended the contract , calling it a " standard non-poach , non-compete arrangement			1
" payments were staggered over a two - year period to ensure @entity7 complied with both obligations , @entity36 said			0
@entity36 said at the time the company " specifically did not want mr @entity7 working with a competitor nor establishing or assisting in the establishment of a business competing directly with @entity41			2
" it added that media reports referring to " secret payments " were " baseless and misleading			0
" " @entity36 was under no obligation , legal or otherwise , to disclose the agreement , " it said			0
@entity36 said its bank , the @entity68 , was aware of the payments , and the total @entity41 sale price was reduced to reflect them			0
claims " outrageous " however , @entity7 's rivals in the @entity73 described the claims as " alarming " and called for @entity7 to make a " full and frank disclosure			1
" " i do n't think the @entity0 people or our constitution would allow the chief executive , which is the head of the executive authorities , to have another job and to have an agreement to help a company -- this is outrageous , " said @entity76 , chair of @entity0 's @entity77			1
@entity88 said members of the @entity73 , @entity0 's governing body , would seek to launch an investigation into the payments			1
but she acknowledged that a majority vote would be needed to approve a formal investigation -- and that the @entity95 majority , which backs @entity7 , would be unlikely to vote in its favor			0
the @entity97 said it had filed a complaint over the payments with the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) , with the request that it be investigated			0
however , @entity7 's allies , including @entity95 legislator , @entity103 , who is a member of the @entity104 , said she did n't consider the payments to be a conflict of interest			1
" up to now , i think it is a normal business dealing and it has been confirmed by some of the business people , " she said			0
pressure intensifies @entity7 had already been under pressure to resign from pro-democracy protesters who for the last two weeks have blocked access to the city 's business district , demanding a greater say in how @entity0 's leader is chosen			1
pro-democracy campaigner , former @entity121 leader and council member , @entity118 said the group was in the " final stages " of preparing documents to impeach @entity7 for the way he had handled protests -- and it was too early to talk about impeaching him on the matter of the payments			2
he called on the chief executive to explain the agreement , though he added : " i can hardly see how an explanation can be satisfactory , but he 's entitled to answer , he 's entitled to be heard			2
" why was the deal struck ? the contract came about during @entity36 's purchase of @entity41 's assets in december 2011			1
the property group had been struggling and in early @entity138 and his fellow @entity41 directors decided to call in administrators , according to @entity33			0
@entity7 resigned on november 24 , and the sale went through in early december for $ 125 million ( hk $ 970 million ) , @entity36 said in a statement on thursday			2
as founder of @entity41 's @entity145 business , @entity7 was considered crucial to the company , something that @entity36 chief executive @entity148 made clear in an interview with the @entity150 in september 2012			1
" @entity152 's history of having set this company up will always be with @entity41			0
he 's been an important part of the history of the company and has been an important part for us in buying the company , " @entity148 was reported to have said			0
@entity7 's office said thursday that without the contract @entity36 would not have proceeded with the deal			1
" no services provided " the @entity164 confirmed on thursday that under the contract @entity7 would " provide assistance in the promotion of the @entity167 and the @entity168 as @entity36 may reasonably required , including but not limited to acting as a referee and adviser from time to time			2
" however it said in a statement " such assistance will only be provided in the event that mr @entity7 failed to be elected as chief executive , and providing that such assistance will not create any conflict of interest			1
" it added : " mr @entity7 has not provided any service to @entity36 after signing the above agreement			0
" the department added that the contract was a " resignation agreement " which covered scenarios if @entity7 did not win the election			2
it repeated @entity36 's statement to @entity33 that at the time the contract was agreed , media coverage suggested that " other candidates were favoured to be elected			0
" in the months before the march 2012 election , @entity193 - backed former top civil servant @entity196 ying - yen was considered to be the likely choice of the @entity44			0
but after what was described as a " calamitous campaign , " @entity49 allegiances were said to have shifted in the final weeks to @entity7			0
a spokesman for @entity49 's @entity202 declined to comment on the controversy on thursday			0
@entity7 's political opponents say answers are needed from a chief executive who has already lost the trust of the people			1
" @entity0 is dealing with this pro-democracy protests and people taking over the streets , the last thing we need is to have another big controversy surrounding the chief executive himself , " the @entity121 's @entity88 said			1
@entity1 's @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 contributed to this report .			0
