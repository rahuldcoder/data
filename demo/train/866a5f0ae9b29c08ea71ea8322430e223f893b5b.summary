-- i once had a pet iguana			1
his name was @entity5 , and he was the biggest , meanest thing you 've ever seen			2
without question , he spawned from the land of darkness , soon deciding his evil role in life was to make every day miserable for the @entity13			2
and he accomplished this by whipping us mercilessly with his powerful tail			0
" good morning , @entity5			0
" thwack ! " screw you , lizard ! " eventually , we tired of the physical and mental abuse and sold @entity5 to man who might have been looking for an exotic pet , or , perhaps , an exotic pair of boots			1
either way , this poor guy was getting an exotic tail straight to the neck			0
thwack ! " screw you , lizard ! " as @entity5 's new owner drove away from our house , thus ended my childhood interest in any pet not covered in fur			1
for it 's hard to be vicious when your primary objective in life is to sleep eighteen hours a day			1
but , hey , plenty of other people still enjoy their weird , exotic pets , and this week i stumbled upon a fascinating , if not completely fabricated , story that was trending all over the @entity46			1
it was about a tortoise in @entity49 who turned up alive and well after going missing from its family more than 30 years ago			1
the story , as recounted by several news agencies and websites who seemed not to find anything particularly odd about the details of this miracle , goes like this : in 1982 , @entity62 the tortoise vanished from her home in @entity64			0
the @entity66 family searched everywhere ( well , almost ) , and finally settled on the perceived reality that , maybe , after workers left a door open , their beloved tortoise just up and decided to leave			0
mind you , very slowly			0
now , fast forward 30 years to earlier this month , when the father of the house sadly passed away			1
the family , despite their grief , eventually decided it was time to go through the old man 's stuff , which was piled high in a second - floor bedroom that was always kept locked			1
that 's when the son , @entity83 , discovered @entity62 inside a box with a record player			1
presumably listening to old @entity87 45s			0
the family daughter , @entity91 , was shocked more than anyone to be reunited with her childhood pet			2
" we 're all thrilled to have @entity62 back , " she said			0
" but no one can understand how she managed to survive for 30 years in there			1
however , a local vet theorized that the notoriously resilient red - footed tortoise , which could have survived long periods without food , possibly snacked on termites			2
which explains why , after three decades locked in a room , the first thing she asked for was an @entity108			0
" get me a @entity110 up in here			0
animal style , yo ! " of course , there 's also the question of water			2
specifically , " where was it ? " nothing i read adequately covered this rather important detail , and i did n't exactly raise the bar very high			2
i literally would 've accepted " magic " as a suitable answer			0
so , who knows ? but , anyway , that 's the ( possibly ) amazing animal story trending out of @entity49			1
and the @entity46 absolutely loves it			0
@entity125 , remarkably , @entity62 is n't the only pet tortoise who has recently found its way into the world 's collective consciousness			1
there 's also @entity132 -- the beloved 100 - pound companion of @entity135 49ers quarterback @entity134 , who will be playing in @entity136 this weekend in @entity137			1
though , the latter would be far more interesting			0
especially when it starts eating the 30 - yard - line			1
" " it 's synthetic turf			2
" " well , i 'll be damned			0
" @entity146 , are n't you @entity147 ? " anyway , there 's my feeble attempt to somehow relate all this to the @entity152			1
naturally , @entity132 the tortoise wo n't be on @entity134 's mind on sunday when he takes on the @entity155			2
but there 's a pretty good chance you 'll hear about the exotic pet in one of those over-produced , pregame mini-biopics			1
perhaps even punctuated by the music of @entity87			0
they 're into that .			0

" @entity170 " is @entity168 's weekly look at *offbeat* *topics* trending online
this week , @entity172 looks at a couple of high - *profile* pet tortoises
one is a @entity49 pet who apparently *reappeared* after 30 years
the other will not -- we *repeat* , " not " -- be playing in the @entity152
