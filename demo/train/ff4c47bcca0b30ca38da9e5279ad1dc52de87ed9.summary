-- even though urinary incontinence affects about 25 million @entity2 and there are many treatment options to improve symptoms , talking about the often unexpected and always urgent need " to go " is still taboo , even with your doctor			1
in my own practice , i see patients who have been living in a constant state of anxiety about their urinary incontinence , mapping out restroom locations for every trip outside their home			1
it is not uncommon for my patients to avoid wearing light - colored clothing or to carry an extra set of clothes in their car			2
many times , patients do n't realize that the issue could have been treated in its earliest stage , before it controls their life			2
there are five common misconceptions that keep patients from speaking with their doctors about their loss of bladder control			2
it 's time we dispel these myths			2
myth : i 'm the only person with incontinence			1
the 24.999999 million other americans with incontinence would disagree with you			1
most individuals with incontinence fall into one of two categories : â € ¢ stress urinary incontinence : leakage of urine when you laugh , cough , exercise , etc. it usually results from weakened pelvic floor muscles			1
â € ¢ urgency urinary incontinence / overactive bladder : loss of urine associated with a sudden and uncontrollable urge to urinate			1
it can be " idiopathic , " meaning there 's no underlying cause , or it could result from a neurologic disorder			2
talk to your doctor about your symptoms			1
occasionally , loss of bladder control is the first noticeable symptom of a larger problem like multiple sclerosis or pelvic organ prolapse			2
myth : it 's irreversible			2
the goal of speaking with your doctor is to regain the bladder control you once had and restore your quality of life			1
in many cases , this is a reasonable objective			0
when preparing for this appointment , be sure to describe in detail any other conditions you have as well as all of the medications you take			0
this can affect the treatment plan your doctor develops for you			1
you may even want to keep a log or a diary as to when , how much and under what conditions you leak			0
this will help your physician get a good snapshot of your daily life			0
myth : it 's a ' normal ' part of aging			0
although loss of bladder control is commonly associated with aging , it is not an inevitable part of the aging process			0
although it is more common in women older than 40 , incontinence can happen to anyone -- men or women , young or old			1
too often , i have had patients who thought that treatment was n't an option because of their age			0
this is not the case			0
if you happen to lose urine every time you sneeze , or if you suddenly have an uncontrollable urge " to go " when you turn the faucet on to wash the dishes , consider talking to your doctor about your symptoms			1
this is not " normal , " regardless of your age , and a doctor can help you manage this condition before it gets worse			1
myth : medications are your only option			0
this is not the case at all			0
in fact , treatment options can range from the most basic lifestyle and behavioral changes , medications , interventional therapies such as @entity137 , medical devices like neuromodulation or surgery			0
no two patients are the same ; some may need instructions on behavioral changes to improve their control while others may need a combination of therapies			0
myth : it 's annoying but not serious			0
however , the seriousness of this condition is measured by the level of undue stress it causes a patient -- and the negative impact it has on your quality of life and those in close contact with you			0
talk to your doctor in the early stages , before you become a prisoner to your bladder .			1
