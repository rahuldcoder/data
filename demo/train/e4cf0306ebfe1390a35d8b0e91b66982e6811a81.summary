-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 on thursday warned 14 absent lawmakers trying to stall his controversial budget bill to return to the state @entity5 immediately to vote on the measure , or layoff notices will be sent to 1,500 public employees before the weekend			1
" unfortunately , if we do n't have action by tomorrow we have a legal and moral obligation to start forewarning people , " @entity1 said a thursday night press conference			2
the layoffs would take effect april 1 , the governor said			2
@entity1 's threat to start laying off workers capped the third week of a high - stakes drama playing out in @entity2			1
meanwhile , a @entity22 judge on thursday issued an order barring demonstrators from the state @entity5 after business hours			1
during protests , some demonstrators have been sleeping inside the building			1
the order from @entity31 judge @entity30 gave the @entity32 of @entity33 the authority to forcibly remove anyone who refuses			2
most of the protesters remaining at the @entity5 thursday evening appeared to abide by the judge 's order			1
some initially balked at the demand they leave the @entity5 by the building 's regular 6 p.m. closing time			1
however , a long line of demonstrators later filed out of the building chanting slogans , carrying bedrolls and banging homemade plastic drums			1
concerns about safety risks arising from the nonstop presence of demonstrators at the @entity5 were heightened thursday with the discovery of 41 rounds of hollow - point rifle ammunition found outside the building			1
police continued their search for more ammunition , and the person to which it belongs , amid a contentious budget showdown over a measure that would -- among other things -- curb the collective bargaining rights of most state workers			1
@entity1 has repeatedly said the collective bargaining provisions of his bill are not negotiable			0
the governor showed little sign of backing down from that stance thursday night			2
instead , @entity1 repeatedly said he was " frustrated " by the intransigence of the 14 @entity76 senators trying to stymie the bill by not showing up to vote			2
he blamed a core group of " extreme " dissenters for standing in the way of compromise			0
" what 's probably the most frustrating is i keep getting the sense that many of these responsible senators are seeking a pathway home , however some of the more extreme members of that caucus are putting up a barrier to them , " @entity1 said			2
@entity1 refused to name any of the senators he believes are blocking negotiations			0
the governor said he and @entity95 house speaker @entity95 have been trying to negotiate with some @entity96			0
@entity1 refused to talk about what " specifics are on the table			0
" weeks of demonstrations in protest of gov. @entity1 's proposal have drawn massive crowds to the state legislature since mid-february , contributing to $ 6.5 million in damages and other costs , state administration secretary @entity100 said during a hearing thursday			0
the hearing examined the question of public access to the building			0
meanwhile , the state @entity113 approved a resolution that would hold absentee @entity76 lawmakers " in contempt of the @entity113 " should they not return to the @entity5 by late afternoon			1
the missing lawmakers -- who left february 17 -- had still not returned by thursday night			0
the contempt measure allows state law enforcement to detain and return the 14 @entity96 to @entity2 , according to @entity121 spokesman @entity121			1
@entity1 said he would prefer that the absent senators return of their own accord			2
" i personally am going to ... try and compel these senators to come back in terms of making an offer , " @entity1 said			0
the lawmakers fled to @entity128 to prevent a quorum for voting on the state 's budget repair bill , which would limit collective bargaining to wages and require public workers , with the exception of police and firefighters , to cover more of their retirement plans and health care premiums			1
but whether the contempt measure is constitutional remains unclear			0
the state constitution prohibits the arrest of lawmakers while the legislature is in session , except for " treason , felony and breach of the peace			0
" whether @entity2 law enforcement would be permitted jurisdiction in @entity128 to detain the missing @entity96 is also unclear			1
the stalemate has proven increasingly contentious in recent days as @entity113 lawmakers adopted a resolution on wednesday that would fine absentee lawmakers $ 100 every day they remain missing			1
a similar resolution passed a day later in @entity157 , where @entity159 @entity158 imposed a $ 250 - a - day fine against @entity160 who -- like their @entity2 counterparts -- fled to @entity128 in protest of a labor bill			1
in @entity2 , @entity158 need a single @entity165 to cross party lines and rejoin the 33 - member legislature to meet the quorum of 20 lawmakers required in a vote on state fiscal matters			1
only 17 lawmakers are required for most other issues			0
@entity176 leaders have agreed to pay more for benefits , but view restricting bargaining rights as an assault on workers ' rights			0
gov. @entity1 took to the airwaves wednesday in support of his belt - tightening measure			0
" every day we fail to act on this just adds more and more to the cost , " he told reporters , defending the curtailing of collective bargaining as an integral part of fiscal reform			0
@entity2 is confronted with a looming $ 137 million shortfall at the end of the fiscal year , june 30			2
the state faces a $ 3.6 billion budget gap by 2013			0
@entity0 's @entity198 contributed to this report			0
