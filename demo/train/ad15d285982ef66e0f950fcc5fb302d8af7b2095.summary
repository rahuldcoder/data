-- investigators combed through @entity3 's history sunday in hopes of learning how the @entity6 - educated son of a @entity8 bank executive ended up carrying what authorities said was a bomb onto a @entity13 - bound jetliner			1
@entity3 was released from a hospital in @entity15 , @entity13 , on sunday after being treated for burns , according to @entity17 , a spokeswoman for the @entity20 attorney 's office in @entity21 , @entity13			1
the 23 - year - old is charged with attempting to set off an explosive device aboard a @entity25 flight from the @entity26 shortly before its landing in @entity21 on christmas day , and was being held in an undisclosed location , @entity17 told @entity0			0
meanwhile , investigators were trying to retrace @entity3 's steps halfway across the globe , from the @entity33 peninsula to @entity34 to @entity6			1
@entity3 claimed to have extremist ties and said the explosive device -- made from a plastic explosive known as @entity41 -- " was acquired in @entity36 along with instructions as to when it should be used , " according to a federal security bulletin			2
a source with knowledge of the investigation told @entity0 sunday that the amount of explosive was sufficient to blow a hole in the side of the aircraft			2
@entity20 intelligence warns that the @entity52 terrorist network has established a foothold in @entity36 , the ancestral homeland of its founder , @entity54 , where government troops are now battling both @entity52 operatives and a @entity60 separatist movement			1
in @entity6 , where the suspect studied engineering at a @entity65 university , police spent a second day searching his last known apartment			0
bombings by home - grown @entity60 radicals killed 52 people in @entity65 in 2005			0
" this man had been in @entity65 , where there is frequent evidence of recruitment by @entity52 , @entity52 - related people , " said @entity71 , the former deputy director of the @entity72 , now a @entity0 analyst			1
" he claims to have been in touch with @entity36 , and @entity36 is a place where @entity52 is on the move			0
" detectives with @entity84 's anti-terrorism branch spent part of sunday interviewing @entity86 , a former high school teacher who described @entity3 as a " very devout " muslim who had once expressed sympathy for @entity92 's @entity91 insurgency during a classroom discussion			1
but @entity86 , who taught @entity3 at a school in the @entity34 nation of @entity96 , said it was not clear whether the then - teenager was simply playing devil 's advocate during the class			1
the site of the @entity65 search was a basement apartment in an ornate building in a wealthy neighborhood			0
@entity3 returned to @entity65 in may , and received a tourist visa from the @entity20 embassy there that he used to fly to @entity21 from the @entity8 commercial capital of @entity109 via @entity110 , the @entity26			1
a family source said @entity3 received a college degree at @entity113 , where spokesman @entity114 said a man named @entity3 was enrolled in the @entity116 between september 2005 and june 2008			2
he then went to @entity117 , the @entity119 's financial hub , around january 2009 to study for a masters degree in international business			0
a @entity20 official said saturday that @entity3 's father contacted the @entity124 in @entity8 several weeks ago to report that his son had " become radicalized			1
" the father , @entity127 , told the embassy the family feared his son had gone to @entity36 to participate in " some kind of jihad , " the family source said			2
the source told @entity0 that @entity3 's father -- who recently retired as chairman of @entity134 , one of @entity8 's premier banks -- had his concerns raised by a text message from his son			1
but a senior @entity140 administration official with knowledge of the case said the father 's call amounted to little more than a " missing person report			0
" the official , who could not speak on the record because of the sensitive nature of the information , said the elder @entity3 was deemed credible as a source , but did not have enough specific information to justify canceling his son 's @entity20 visa or putting him on a " no - fly " list			1
" if we pulled his visa or banned him from flying , that would have alerted him you are onto him , " the official said			0
" whereas in some cases if you have a terror lead , you watch to see what happens when he travels , which could be more valuable			0
" in addition , the official said , it was " fairly early in the process of what kind of threat this guy poses			0
" the father 's information was vetted and a determination on how to proceed was made through a @entity20 inter-agency process , and a file was opened on @entity3 about five weeks ago			1
but the official added , " one part of the system that absolutely failed " was that @entity3 was able to board a plane to the @entity20 allegedly with @entity41			2
@entity3 first boarded a @entity177 flight from @entity109 , @entity8 , to @entity110			0
both @entity8 authorities and @entity177 , a @entity25 partner , say he received secondary security screening			0
but a @entity20 official said friday that @entity3 was not checked for traces of explosives using a more extensive test			2
@entity0 's @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .			0
