if the first thing you 've ever heard about black @entity3 in @entity4 came out of the mouth — allegedly , still , for now — of @entity7 owner @entity6 , i 'm sorry to hear that			1
the reported rambling of an octogenarian billionaire in what sounds like a bedroom fight with his 30 - something mistress probably is n't the best source for dissecting geopolitical religiosity			2
" you go to @entity4 , the blacks are just treated like dogs , " the @entity16 said on the recording leaked by somebody perhaps his mistress			1
here 's the full exchange : the @entity24 : " it 's the world ! you go to @entity4 , the blacks are just treated like dogs			1
" the mistress : " so do you have to treat them like that , too ? " @entity24 : " the white @entity3 , there 's white @entity3 and black @entity3			1
do you understand ? " mistress : " and are the black @entity3 less than the white @entity3 ? " @entity24 : " a hundred percent , fifty , a hundred percent			1
" on the surface , @entity6 might have a point — even if no one can make any sense of where he was going with it — that dark - skinned @entity3 have experienced adversity in the jewish state			1
but to say '' dogs " is n't quite kosher			2
@entity4 touts with pride successes like @entity44 , its airlift of @entity46 in 1991 — where in one push , more than 14,000 were transported to @entity4 over 36 hours — to escape persecution in a homeland where the religion has been practiced since biblical times			1
there 's no question that life , especially the fact that they are alive , is better in the @entity57			2
yet it has n't been overflowing with milk and honey			0
@entity61 @entity3 are among the poorest israelis , with 72 % living below the poverty line and unemployment affecting as many as six in 10 @entity61 men and three - quarters of women , according to the @entity67			1
consider also that many came from villages without electricity or running water , and that 70 % were functionally illiterate in their native @entity72 and never learned to read or write @entity73			0
it 's obvious they 'd have trouble integrating into an industrialized society			2
frustrations boiled over two years ago in the city of @entity80 , when thousands demonstrated against discriminatory practices , including apartment owners who refused to rent to @entity61 israelis			0
but dogs ? " that 's insane			1
that 's disgusting , " said @entity89 , an @entity61 @entity4 filmmaker living in @entity90			1
" basically , this man is stupid			0
he does n't know any history of @entity100 people , " said @entity89 , who in his film " @entity93 " documented his own harrowing escape from @entity61 as a child , getting separated from his family and nearly dying in the desert			0
the other side of the @entity61 @entity67 story counts successes like members of the @entity105 , writers and musicians , and @entity108 , the current miss @entity4			1
while acknowledging that assimilation and rejection are real , @entity89 said : " there 's a lot of change from what happened in the ' 80s			2
we had the issue of language and communication and culture			0
they see us as different , but year - by - year , it 's improved			2
" that 's because the community is n't just sitting there taking it , he says			0
" they do n't give up			0
" if it 's necessary to prove @entity135 wrong ( requisite disclaimer again : assuming it 's him ) , @entity89 's message of empowerment flies in the face of the repeated theme on the tape that the world is racist and there 's nothing you can do about it			1
" it is n't a question			0
we do n't evaluate what 's right and wrong			0
we live in a society			0
we live in a culture			0
we have to live within that culture , " the guy in the recording says to sum up his black @entity3 narrative — which , by the way , is n't clear about who he 's referring to			1
" which people is he talking about when he says ' black @entity3 ? ' " asked @entity89			1
" that could be people from @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 " — all with very different cultures			0
ca n't believe that ( a guy that sounds like ) @entity6 would stereotype them			2
join us on @entity169 / @entity168 .			0

@entity171 looks at comments *attributed* to @entity135 that slam black @entity3 in @entity4
" you go to @entity4 , the blacks are just treated like dogs , " said a voice reported to be @entity6 's
black @entity3 face adversity , but to *compare* them to " dogs " is out of bounds , he says
