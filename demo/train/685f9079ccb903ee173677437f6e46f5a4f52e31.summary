-- a federal court on wednesday struck down two provisions of the @entity3 dealing with searches and intelligence gathering , saying they violate the @entity7 protection against unreasonable searches and seizures with regard to criminal prosecutions			1
" it is critical that we , as a democratic nation , pay close attention to traditional @entity7 principles , " wrote judge @entity12 of the @entity13 for the @entity14 in her 44 - page decision			1
" the @entity7 has served this nation well for 220 years , through many other perils			1
" the @entity23 , set up to review wiretap applications in intelligence cases under the @entity26 , or @entity26 , " holds that the @entity27 need not control the conduct of criminal surveillance in the @entity30 , " @entity12 wrote			0
" in place of the @entity7 , the people are expected to defer to the executive branch and its representation that it will authorize such surveillance only when appropriate			1
" the government " is asking this court to , in essence , amend the @entity38 , by giving it an interpretation that would deprive it of any real meaning			0
the court declines to do so , " @entity12 said			0
the @entity45 was reviewing the decision , said spokesman @entity47			0
the ruling was a response to a lawsuit filed against the federal government by @entity52 , a @entity53 , @entity54 , attorney who was wrongly arrested for alleged involvement in the 2004 @entity57 train bombings			1
the federal government later apologized to @entity52 and settled part of @entity52 's lawsuit for $ 2 million			2
but @entity52 was permitted to keep pursuing the portions of his lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the @entity3			1
@entity52 claimed in the suit that his home and law offices were secretly broken into by the @entity67 , his clients ' files at his office were searched , his business and personal computers were secretly copied , his telephone was wiretapped and his home was bugged			2
@entity52 said he was " excited and happy " with the ruling			2
" this , to me , is not so much personal , " he said			0
" i think it 's just the right thing to do			0
it was the right thing to continue to challenge the constitutionality of the @entity3			1
" " this is an example of the judicial branch doing what it should do , and that 's to be a check and balance for the legislative and executive branch of government , " he said			0
" i feel wonderful today , because the @entity7 has been restored to its rightful place , and the balance between liberty and security is balanced again			2
" @entity52 's attorneys -- @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 -- lauded the ruling			2
" judge @entity12 , in striking down the challenged provisions of the @entity3 , has upheld both the tradition of judicial independence and our nation 's most cherished principle of the right to be secure in one 's own home , " they said in a written statement			1
" we are relieved that the @entity38 can be honored and preserved even in times of perceived crisis			0
" @entity12 ruled that @entity26 , as amended by the @entity3 , permits the government to conduct surveillance and searches targeting @entity30 without satisfying the probable - cause standard in the @entity7			1
" prior to the amendments [ to @entity26 ] , the three branches of government operated with thoughtful and deliberate checks and balances -- a principle upon which our nation was founded , " @entity12 wrote			0
but the @entity3 , she said , eliminated " the constitutionally required interplay between executive action , judicial decision and @entity126 enactment			2
" " for over 200 years , this nation has adhered to the rule of law -- with unparalleled success			0
a shift to a nation based on extra-constitutional authority is prohibited , as well as ill - advised , " she wrote			0
@entity12 noted that @entity26 does not require that the subject of a search be notified , although the @entity7 ordinarily does			1
in addition , she said , the @entity7 requires particularity -- authorities seeking a search warrant , for example , must list what they are looking for and where they are looking for it			1
named to the bench in 1997 by president @entity144 , @entity12 is considered one of the more liberal judges on the federal bench in @entity54			0

judge : search warrants issued without showing probable cause
attorney seeks ruling after being wrongly linked to ' 04 @entity57 train bombing
his suit says secret searches of house , office violated @entity7 rights
as part of suit settlement , he retained right to challenge parts of @entity3
