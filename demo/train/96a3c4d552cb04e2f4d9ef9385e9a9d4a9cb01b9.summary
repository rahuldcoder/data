editor 's note : @entity2 is a senior political analyst for @entity3 , appearing regularly on @entity3 's " @entity4 , " " @entity5 , " " @entity6 " and " @entity7 " as well as other programs during special event coverage			1
@entity2 says president @entity11 's plans are running into @entity13 ' widespread mistrust of government			1
( @entity3 ) -- so now comes the hard part			0
now that a key @entity17 committee has finally moved a health care bill , president @entity11 can get to work to try and figure out a final version of reform			1
now that gen. @entity21 has recommended a large troop buildup in @entity23 -- setting off an internal debate about recalibrating strategy -- the president can decide what he wants to do about the war			0
and now that the stock market is on the rebound -- while unemployment remains high -- @entity11 can figure out how to come up with a " son of stimulus " package that targets jobs			1
tough decisions are part of the president 's job description , after all			2
but here 's the tricky part : how to convince the public that you -- and government -- will do the right thing , or are even capable of it			1
sure , distrust of government is as old as government itself			2
and there 's an inherent conflict in current public thinking , as scholars @entity54 and @entity56 point out : while people want government to solve big problems like health care , they do n't trust the government to do it			1
" there is nothing new about this ambivalence , " they write in an essay aptly titled " change you can believe in requires a government you can trust			2
" they write , " but how ... the president deals with it may make the difference between success and failure			2
" so what 's a president with a big agenda to do ? he could have narrowed it , but instead decided to play " all - in			0
" because he was so popular , and because voters were so ready for a change , there was some thought the country might buy into the notion that good leadership could actually change the ethos of bad government			0
@entity11 probably believed it , too			1
so when the economic stimulus package was hatched , with hardly a @entity94 vote , the @entity91 remained hopeful that , in the end , its success would restore confidence in their work			1
and they have since toiled mightily to brag about the stimulus package as evidence that government can work			0
after all , if @entity104 could do it , why not @entity11 ? instead , the stimulus has become a handy target			1
@entity108 may be doing well , both conservatives and liberals rail , but the jobs elsewhere are not coming back			0
and as the president now moves to ask the nation to support an overhaul of health care , voters are still asking : why should we trust the government to do that ? consider these numbers : at the end of the @entity123 administration -- with an unpopular president -- just 17 percent of the @entity13 public trusted the government to " do the right thing " all or most of the time			1
and for all of the popularity of @entity11 , that number now stands at a measly 23 percent			1
after @entity131 lost health care reform -- and control of the @entity134 -- trust in government in 1994 was at an all - time low : 21 percent			0
we 're almost there now			0
@entity139 understood , and used to his benefit , the antipathy toward government			0
he used to joke that the scariest words in the lexicon were " i 'm from the government and i 'm here to help			0
" he wanted to make government smaller , and his overall success with that notion prompted president @entity131 to famously tell @entity134 " the era of big government is over			2
" well , it 's back			0
the question is whether president @entity11 can convince us that more government is what we want -- and need			1
as @entity139 once told us , " trust , but verify			0
" if only we could			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : now the heat is on @entity11 to make *crucial* decisions
she says @entity91 bet that @entity13 would become more *pro-government*
she says *reality* is that most people are still distrustful of government
@entity2 : can @entity11 convince people that we need more government ?
