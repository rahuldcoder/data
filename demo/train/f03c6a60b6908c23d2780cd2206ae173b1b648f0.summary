-- most fans picturing rapper 50 cent operating a joystick would probably envision the hip - hop star blasting away opponents in his latest video game release , " @entity8			1
" rapper @entity2 performs at the @entity9 in december			1
those same fans might be surprised to learn the hardcore rapper also has a soft spot for old - school throwbacks like " @entity14 , " " @entity15 " and the venerable " @entity16			2
" @entity2 plays " @entity16 " ? really ? " yeah , " said the rapper , as well known for surviving nine bullet wounds as he is for his platinum - selling albums			1
" when i went to perform at the @entity9 , i got a chance to see how they had the older games now on @entity23			0
so i went and got the @entity23 system so i can play ' @entity16			0
' " @entity26 , overall - wearing characters aside , @entity2 knows what gamers like -- and that came in handy during the development of " @entity8			1
" the new @entity32 - released game , available for @entity33 and @entity34 , features @entity2 in his trademark bulletproof vest doing battle in the @entity37 after he and some members of his group , the @entity39 , are cheated out of their concert fee			1
the action ramps up after the concert promoter , unable to pay , presents the group with a diamond - encrusted skull that is later stolen			2
plenty of bullets fly and the body count mounts as " @entity8 " lives up to its name			2
all that violence is n't surprising given the hardcore nature of @entity2 's music , for which he has often been criticized			1
so why endorse and lend his image to a violent video game , he 's asked , given the heat he 's already taken for similar themes in his music ? " the violence in the music is the harsh reality , " he responds			1
" i guess they ignore the newspaper for the people who say that that 's violent			0
i guess they would like to avoid it or do n't want it to have such a strong voice with the position i have earned in pop culture and entertainment			0
" in reviewing " @entity8 " for @entity72 , writer @entity71 points out that while violent , the game is also campy fun			1
" now , if there was any inkling that i was supposed to take ' blood on the @entity79 ' the least bit seriously , i might venture to call the game a bit shallow , " herring writes			2
" but with the wanton firefights and explosive @entity86 action all remaining firmly tongue in cheek , you ca n't help but laugh and enjoy the ridiculous ride			0
" @entity2 says he was involved in the development of " @entity8 , " but let the experts do the heavy lifting			1
" i was smart enough to allow the computer programmers to design the actual game without injecting so much input that i lost what would be the highest technology for the game , " he said			2
" i made a few slight changes based on the things that influenced me			0
" some of those suggestions , he said , grew out of his experience performing for the troops in @entity104 as well as his viewing of the film " @entity108 , " which starred @entity107			0
video games are just a small portion of the rapper 's ever - growing empire			1
he 's dabbled in all types of media , including books , movies and the @entity117 , and has benefited from high - profile partnerships with companies like @entity120 , the makers of @entity121			2
he said he 's finding inspiration for new projects close to home : he 's optioned the rights to turn the @entity32 video game " @entity127 " into a movie			1
" @entity8 " is n't @entity2 's first foray into the world of gaming			1
a previous @entity2 game , " @entity133 , " came out in 2005			1
the rapper has tied music and video games together by including some game - only tracks with " @entity8			1
" he 's determined to keep mixing things up			0
his last album , 2007 's " @entity140 , " featured collaborations with an array of other artists including @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			0
though much was made at the time of a sales battle between @entity2 and @entity150 -- whose " graduation " was originally scheduled to be released on the same day and sold more copies than " @entity140 " -- 50 now says that he was happy with the performance of the album , which peaked at no. 2 on the @entity156 chart			1
still , he adds , he 's not convinced the audience totally grasped what he was attempting to do			0
" the ' @entity140 ' album was an artist album for me , " he says			0
" it was me reaching out to the other artists to creatively offer a different perspective			0
we had to find a common ground in order to do that effectively			0
" he said there are sometimes tracks that do n't fit in with the vision of an album			0
that material is what he tapped into for some of the unreleased tracks on the new video game			1
in the future , he says he would like to be involved in the development and marketing of a game in which he does n't star			0
but his love of video games stretches back to his childhood			0
having lots of time on the road has enabled him to reconnect with the fun , he said			0
" since i have been touring , video gaming has become more of an entertainment for me , " @entity2 said , adding that he has both the @entity33 and the @entity34 with him on tour , one for each end of the bus			2
" @entity8 " is rated " m " for mature for the violence and language , but at least one young person has already mastered it -- @entity2 's son , @entity196			1
" he came in and already knows how to beat me in this game , " @entity2 said			2
" he just came in like he was a pro , whupping me in my game			0
