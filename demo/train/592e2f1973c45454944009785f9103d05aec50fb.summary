@entity0 -- @entity3 's royal family has long been taunted for its @entity5 roots , but now a more exotic lineage can be revealed after evidence emerged indicating that prince @entity8 is the direct descendant of an @entity11 woman			1
the @entity13 's maternal lineage was revealed on friday by a genetic ancestry testing company , @entity15 , which carried out tests on the dna of princess @entity19 's two matrilineal cousins and compared them to a global database of samples			2
those tests reveal that the prince 's fourth great - grandmother was the daughter of @entity25 and @entity26 ( 1788 - 1820 ) , a @entity27 merchant who worked in @entity28 , north of what is now @entity30			1
@entity25 's mitochondrial dna -- which is only passed on from mother to child -- was then passed down , the company says , through the couple 's daughter and female descendants , one of whom , @entity31 ( 1936 - 2004 ) , married @entity41 and bore a daughter , lady @entity19 , the prince 's mother			2
@entity43 , chief scientist at @entity15 , told @entity1 the discovery means " @entity8 probably has a very small amount ( of @entity11 dna ) , maybe half a percent will be of @entity48 heritage			0
" " the mitochondrial dna will not be passed on to the child of @entity8 and @entity51 , " he added			0
" but because we also did some testing on the other dna of his cousins , we could see that they had little bits of @entity11 dna across their genome , so it 's quite likely that @entity8 has a few other bits of @entity11 dna , and he could well pass them on to the child			0
" prince @entity8 's wife , @entity51 , the @entity51 , is expecting the couple 's first child			1
