-- democracy campaigners in @entity2 and politicians around the world are calling for this sunday 's @entity6 race in the @entity8 state to be canceled as violent clashes continue between activists and authorities			1
what are the issues around the controversy , and how are the sport and its fans reacting ? why are there calls for this weekend 's @entity19 in @entity2 to be scrapped ? opposition groups in @entity2 as well as politicians , rights groups and many @entity24 fans around the world want sunday 's @entity19 -- which could be watched by a global audience of more than 500 million -- to be canceled while the @entity8 state braces itself for more violent demonstrations after months of political unrest			1
protesters see the race as a publicity stunt by the country 's rulers to make the nation seem more unified than it actually is			1
the @entity35 was canceled last year amid a @entity37 - led uprising against the @entity39 monarchy and a government crackdown in which dozens were killed and hundreds detained			1
@entity42 , an opposition protester , said the demonstrators were not against the @entity6 race itself			1
" we are just against the government or the oppressive ruling elite using that as @entity48 , " @entity42 said			0
in @entity52 , where many @entity24 teams are based , opposition leader @entity49 said : " @entity53 and politics generally should n't mix , but ... what kind of signal does it send to the world when this grand prix is going ahead , given the concerns there are , given the violence we have seen in @entity2 , given the continuing issues around human rights ? " i do n't think it 's the right decision to let this grand prix go ahead and i think the government needs to weigh in and express its view			1
" and opposition politician @entity67 urged @entity52 @entity24 stars @entity69 and @entity70 to pull out of the race			1
" it should n't go ahead , i do n't think @entity52 drivers should go			2
i think the @entity6 should not go ahead in @entity2 , " @entity74 told the @entity75			1
but @entity52 prime minister @entity76 refused to join the calls , insisting it was a matter for the @entity6 authorities whether the race went ahead			2
" it is important that peaceful protests are allowed to go ahead , " he said			2
why are protests now taking place in @entity2 ? @entity37 opposition groups in the @entity39 - ruled kingdom say they want equality , and have posted calls on social networking sites for daily protests during the @entity19 weekend , to focus media attention on their demands			1
the government has sought to ban protests in the capital @entity96 but that has failed to prevent violent clashes in the capital between demonstrators and authorities , who are accused of heavy - handed tactics			2
the government has condemned violence on all sides -- saying that any police officers found guilty of heavy - handed tactics would be held to account and that protesters should behave in a civil manner as well			2
an @entity110 report this week says promised reforms in @entity2 are inadequate and fail to provide justice for victims of human rights violations			1
protesters are also demanding the release of jailed activist @entity117 , who has been on hunger strike for more than 70 days			2
@entity119 , 52 , was arrested in april 2011 for his role in anti-government protests that began a month earlier with demands for political reform and greater freedoms for @entity37			2
in june , @entity2 found him and seven other @entity37 opposition activists guilty of plotting to overthrow the country 's royal family			1
the government also stands accused of punishing its own national sporting heroes and accusing them of being traitors			0
international and local human rights groups say three players in the @entity2 national soccer squad were arrested last year , along with more than 150 sportsmen , women and administrators			1
it is unclear how many remain in jail			0
the authorities maintain they were part of illegal , violent protests			0
could protesters disrupt the race or threaten spectators ? this is the big question			2
protesters have vowed to protest near the @entity148 circuit , which is about 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) from @entity96 , but witnesses there say there is a heavy police presence on the road between the track and the airport			0
the unrest makes hosting the race precarious because the racers must pass through some areas where clashes have occurred to get to the circuit , which is in the desert			0
on thursday protesters burned tyres , briefly blocking several main roads leading to @entity148			0
a @entity166 cocktail exploded late wednesday near a car carrying members of one @entity24 team , @entity169 , during clashes between protesters and security forces			1
no one was reported injured in the incident			0
the incident prompted a team member and a contractor to return home despite reassurances by officials that @entity2 is safe			2
@entity2 has refused to extend visas of non-sports reporting crews from @entity0 and other news organizations , saying they can not stay for the race			1
what do @entity24 drivers and the sport 's governing body say ? @entity6 's governing body , the @entity191 , decided last week the race should go ahead , after weeks of speculation			1
the governing body said its president traveled to @entity2 in november and met " decision - makers and opinion formers , including elected @entity37 members of parliament			1
all expressed their wish for the @entity19 to go ahead in 2012 , " it said			0
drivers have attempted to distance themselves from the violence			0
@entity206 of @entity207 - based @entity205 said his team was preparing for the event " as well as we can			0
" " as you say , we ca n't ignore the situation			0
but in another way , i hope the race may make a clear vision and help the situation and i think the @entity19 will be nice , " he told reporters in @entity2			1
reigning champion @entity218 brushed off any concerns about safety , saying : " i heard about the issue at @entity169			2
" generally in the paddock ( staging area for the cars ) it seems to be no problem , " he told the @entity222			0
" outside of the paddock maybe there is a risk , but i think there is a risk everywhere we go			0
" seven - times title winner @entity233 initially insisted he did not want to get involved before saying : " i just want to say one thing which is i do n't want to mix the sport with politics			0
i 'm here for the sport			0
" how much is the race worth to @entity2 and to @entity6 itself ? @entity2 pays $ 64 million to host the @entity19 but the island kingdom it is estimated to receive several times that amount -- up to $ 800 million -- from tourism and other economic benefits			1
of more importance is the issue of prestige that the race could bring			0
" @entity2 is no different from the other @entity8 in using high profile sporting events like tennis and golf tournaments to raise their own international prestige , " @entity252 , a journalist who has written about sport in the @entity254 and is the author of " when @entity256 : football in the @entity258 , " told @entity0			1
" @entity259 winning the bid to host the @entity262 finals is a case in point			0
the @entity265 has been instrumental in raising @entity2 's international profile far higher than a small island with a population of around 1 million people could expect			1
" the idea that sport and politics should be separated is worse than a myth			0
the royal family of @entity2 secured the @entity276 with wider economic and political aims in mind			2
they are even promoting the race within @entity2 as a potentially unifying force for the kingdom			1
they say that politics has no role in sport but separating sport from the political realities of any society is as impossible as separating politics and art , or music			0
" have there been protests against @entity24 races held in other countries accused of human rights abuses ? no. last week 's race in @entity299 took place without any calls for it to be cancelled despite concerns about human rights in that country			1
the same could be said for races in @entity306 and @entity307			0
the only serious protests in the history of @entity6 -- a multi-billion dollar sport and industry -- were before the @entity312 @entity19 at @entity313 in 1985 against the apartheid regime			0
despite a boycott of @entity312 teams in other leading sports at the time , the event still took place , but was cancelled the following year and only resumed in 1992			0
how have @entity24 fans reacted ? many fans of the sport have reacted with disgust , with countless posts on @entity325 saying that they would refuse to even watch the race on television in protest			1
@entity329 , a writer for @entity52 magazine motorsport , told @entity0 : " we did a poll on our website recently and the response was instant			0
we simply wrote ' @entity24 go to @entity2 ? yes or no ? ' and hundreds of people got back to us straight away			1
" i think only one said that we should			0
it 's pretty clear speaking to people that a lot of the fans have decided to not watch the race out of principle			2
" it remains unclear how @entity24 fans will react to calls to boycott the race -- either at the track or watching on tv			1
but one news agency , the @entity52 's @entity222 , reported there were few spectators in the main grandstand at @entity148 to watch friday 's practice session .			0
