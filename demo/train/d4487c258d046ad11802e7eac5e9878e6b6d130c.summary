@entity0 -- what a difference a decade makes			0
when @entity5 and @entity6 led the @entity7 to war in @entity9 over the issue of chemical weapons 11 years ago , they had the support of all but six of the majority @entity13 in the @entity15			1
now there are three times as many republicans on the record against a strike on @entity21			2
@entity22 : how they 'll vote on @entity21 strike @entity7 house : how they 'll vote on @entity21 strike @entity5 has declined to weigh in on @entity21 and @entity6 's daughter , @entity27 , running for @entity22 in a tough primary challenge against fellow @entity13 @entity29 in @entity30 , has come out against @entity32 's plan to strike @entity21			1
@entity6 told a town hall meeting in @entity30 on tuesday that @entity32 has taken " an amateurish approach to national security and foreign policy , " according to the @entity34 and guide			0
@entity6 also said her opposition to intervention should not be misconstrued			0
" the press will try to portray this @entity21 debate as a battle between wings of the @entity13 , " she said , according to the newspaper			1
" do n't believe them			0
" but there 's a lot of evidence that there is a battle going on in the @entity13			0
start with @entity6 , who has defended her father 's involvement in the lead - up to the @entity9 war and who , before she was a @entity22 candidate , talked about the need for red lines in @entity21			1
if @entity32 wants to lead the @entity7 against @entity21 this year to ward off the spread of chemical weapons , he 'll have to do it in spite of a @entity13 @entity15 , not with its help			1
@entity22 panel backs military strike plan what happened between now and then ? war -- 11 years of it in @entity72 and @entity9			1
those wars are not popular with @entity7 and neither is the prospect of military strikes within @entity21			2
two polls out wednesday from @entity77 / the @entity78 and from @entity79 showed opposition to military strikes far outweighed support			0
polls : should @entity7 launch strikes against @entity21 ? there are stalwart security - minded @entity13 who beat the drum and argue the @entity7 should lead the international community against bad actors			1
sen. @entity90 of @entity91 , the party 's standard - bearer in 2008 , has been the single most vocal lawmaker in favor of @entity7 military action against @entity21			1
@entity90 , @entity97 issue tough warnings on @entity21 dilemma @entity99 : @entity32 's irony , @entity90 's agony but most of the convincing he 'll have to do is among his own party , which rode the war on terror into @entity9 on the premise of weapons of mass destruction			1
when @entity90 ran for president , he easily defeated rep. @entity112 of @entity113 in the primaries and at times he laughed off @entity112 's noninterventionist approach to foreign policy			2
@entity90 is n't laughing now at @entity112 's son , @entity117 , the @entity118 @entity13 and potential 2016 presidential candidate who shares many of his father 's noninterventionist views and is organizing the effort against a strike on @entity21			1
@entity112 to @entity32 : do n't rush into war in @entity21 the first test vote on @entity126 came wednesday when the @entity127 voted 10 - 7 in favor of the president 's proposal			2
that 's a margin close enough to raise questions about whether the proposal will have enough support to get beyond a filibuster			0
five of the committee 's republicans , including @entity112 , voted no. @entity90 joined the majority of @entity140 in voting yes			2
a number of @entity13 leaders have joined the call for military strikes , including @entity15 speaker @entity145 and majority leader @entity146 , the top republicans in the @entity15			1
but they 're just two of eight @entity13 in the @entity15 to publicly endorse military action			1
other voices in the party are growing louder in their opposition			0
@entity153 , who defended the war in @entity9 as @entity90 's running mate in 2008 , posted a @entity157 message on @entity21 that declared @entity7 should just let " @entity158 sort it out			1
" @entity159 : @entity153 's offensive remarks about @entity21 sen. @entity161 , a @entity113 @entity13 , has questions about the motives of the @entity21 opposition fighting against the government there			1
he said the airstrikes against @entity21 president @entity167 would turn the @entity7 military into " @entity170 's @entity169			2
" certainly , there are @entity140 who opposed the war in @entity9 who are now arguing for intervention in @entity21			1
both sens. @entity175 of @entity176 and @entity177 of @entity178 voted against the resolution in 2002 that gave @entity5 the authority to invade @entity9			0
they both supported @entity32 on @entity126 on wednesday			0
@entity183 , the secretary of state making @entity32 's case this week , came to regret his own vote in favor of invading @entity9			0
now he finds himself arguing that the use of chemical weapons in @entity21 requires that the @entity7 takes action			0
but the story of foreign policy transformation here seems more definitive on the @entity13 side			0
nowhere is that tension more obvious than with sen. @entity195 , the @entity196 @entity13 and another potential 2016 presidential candidate , who seems torn between @entity90 and @entity112 on the issue			1
@entity195 has long been critical of the @entity32 administration on @entity21 and called for more support of the rebel factions struggling to topple @entity167			2
but @entity195 ended up voting against giving the president war powers on wednesday even as he said @entity32 should have done much more earlier			0
" while i have long argued forcefully for engagement in empowering the @entity21 people , i have never supported the use of @entity7 military force in the conflict			2
and i still do n't			0
i remain unconvinced that the use of force proposed here will work , " he said			0
" the only thing that will prevent @entity167 from using chemical weapons in the future is for the @entity21 people to remove him from power			0
the strike the administration wants us to approve i do not believe furthers that goal			0
and in fact , i believe @entity7 military action of the type contemplated here might prove to be counterproductive			2
" for now , at least , the @entity13 's foreign policy preference appears to be slanting away from @entity90 and toward @entity225 .			1

when the war in @entity9 started 11 years ago , many republicans in the @entity15 supported it
now it appears many @entity15 @entity13 opposes military action in @entity21
more than a decade of war in @entity9 and @entity72 has led to noninterventionist views in @entity13
@entity90 favors intervention , @entity225 does not , and @entity195 is in between
