@entity0 , @entity1 -- a senior @entity1 intelligence official told @entity2 friday that @entity5 military personnel have left a southern base said to be a key hub for @entity5 drone operations in the country 's northwestern tribal areas			1
it is the @entity12 in @entity1 's @entity13 , from which drones are said to take off and where they are refueled for operations against @entity17 militants			2
the development comes amid a public furor over @entity5 drone attacks , which have killed civilians			1
a suspected @entity5 drone strike friday in the @entity1 tribal region killed 25 people , including eight civilians and 17 militants , a @entity1 intelligence source said			1
this came after another strike on march 17 killed 44 people , most of them civilians			2
yet a @entity5 official disputed the @entity1 contention that civilians died in friday 's drone strike			1
" there is no evidence to support that claim whatsoever , " the @entity5 official said			1
another senior @entity1 intelligence official , who did not want to be identified discussing a sensitive issue , confirmed that the @entity5 had been using the base as a center of operations for launching drone strikes			1
he was not able to confirm the @entity5 had left			0
while the first official was able to confirm that @entity5 personnel were no longer operating out of the base , he could not say whether they had left voluntarily or at the request of the @entity1 government			1
the operation of the base -- not publicly acknowledged by the @entity5 government -- has always been presumed to have occurred with tacit @entity1 military consent			1
it was not clear from the @entity1 officials when the presence there began or when it ended			0
a @entity5 military official who did not want to be identified told @entity2 : " there are no @entity5 forces at @entity12 in @entity13			1
" he did not respond at the time or in writing to queries as to whether @entity5 personnel had been based there in the past			2
the departure of @entity5 personnel -- if confirmed -- would be significant because of increasing strain between @entity0 and @entity66 sparked by the continuing drone attacks and by the @entity69 affair , in which a @entity71 contractor fatally shot two @entity1 men in a @entity74 neighborhood			1
it has always been unclear how many drone bases the @entity5 operates in or near @entity1			1
but the friday attack in @entity78 that killed 25 people would indicate the @entity5 maintains the capability to strike tribal areas with drones			1
@entity84 , research analyst at the @entity85 think tank , said he does n't think the alleged move will affect the effort using drones to target the @entity89 and other militant groups holed up in the tribal region			0
that 's because many strikes have been conducted from closer bases , such as those across the @entity1 border in eastern @entity98 provinces			2
he said the @entity1 could be making the alleged move to appease a populace angry at the @entity5			1
the southern air base , he said , does n't appear to be integral to the tribal area fight and is probably a supporting base			0
" it 's not like the @entity1 shut down the program , " he said			0
" it 's possible they want to do this as a means of pre-empting drone strikes in @entity13 , " where there is a @entity112 presence			1
" the @entity5 has an interest in going after the @entity112 in @entity13 " he said , and in an ideal world the @entity5 would like to target @entity112 sanctuaries in that region with drones			0
also , he said , it 's possible the @entity1 are using pressure on the @entity5 to offset any @entity5 pressure on them			1
he said it 's no coincidence that the development emerged after adm. @entity123 , chairman of the @entity124 , visited @entity0			0
in an interview that aired wednesday on @entity1 's @entity126 , @entity123 spoke forcefully about the @entity89 , which he said " very specifically facilitates and supports the @entity112 who move in @entity98 , and they 're killing @entity5			1
" " i ca n't accept that and i will do everything i possibly can to prevent that specifically , " he said			0
then @entity123 said @entity1 's @entity132 " has a longstanding relationship with the @entity89			0
that does n't mean everybody in the @entity132 , but it 's there			0
" " i also have an understanding that the @entity132 and the ( @entity1 military ) exist to protect their own citizens , and there 's a way they have done that for a long period of time , " @entity123 said			2
" i believe that over time , that 's got to change			0
" a senior @entity1 intelligence official responded by saying , " we do have a relationship : that of an adversary			2
" " we have made our resolve very clear that ( the @entity89 ) is an enemy we need to fight together , " said the official , who did not want to be identified discussing intelligence matters			0
the @entity1 intelligence official told @entity2 that " we have our hands full " fighting other @entity155 militant groups along the border with @entity98 , notably those under the umbrella of the @entity159 , " and once we are through with them we can turn on the other ( the @entity89 )			2
we do not have the capacity to undertake simultaneous operations			0
" the official said the " onus of providing proof of this " relationship was on the @entity5 and it was not up to the @entity132 " to start providing clarification			2
" asked if offense was taken from @entity123 's remarks , the intelligence official said : " not personally , no. " in friday 's attack , a drone fired five missiles on a hideout in @entity177 of @entity78 , one of the seven districts of @entity1 's volatile tribal region bordering @entity98 , two intelligence officials said			1
the officials said the militants , who were staying in the hideout , were planning to move into @entity98 for an attack against coalition forces			0
the militants were local @entity112 members from @entity187 , another district of @entity1 's tribal region , who were trained for war , the officials said			0
the intelligence officials asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media			0
but the attack also killed at least three women when one of the missiles hit a house next to the targeted compound , officials said			0
the @entity1 intelligence source identified the civilians killed as five women and three children			1
friday 's drone strike was the 20th this year compared with 111 in all of 2010 , based on a @entity2 tally			2
the strike comes two days after @entity1 issued a strongly worded statement condemning deadly suspected @entity5 drone strikes in the country 's tribal region			1
" drone attacks have become a core irritant in the counterterror campaign , " a statement from the @entity212 said wednesday			0
" we have repeatedly said that such attacks are counterproductive and only contribute to strengthen the hands of the terrorists			0
" @entity2 's @entity220 and @entity221 contributed to this report .			0
