-- the " @entity4 " has been to the moon and back -- or at least a digital image of her			2
the famous face was used in an experiment and carried in a laser beam to a man - made satellite orbiting the moon , @entity5 said thursday			1
the successful transmission is a significant achievement -- which @entity14 painter @entity13 would have surely appreciated -- because it marks " the first time anyone has achieved one - way laser communication at planetary distances , " said principal investigator @entity16 of the @entity17			2
by using lasers , @entity5 is now on the verge of revolutionizing and speeding up delivery of data now dispatched from outer space and all around the solar system , the agency said			1
laser technology is used in cds that have made albums obsolete , and now it holds the promise of bringing live , high - definition video feeds from far reaches of the solar system , including @entity35 , @entity5 said			1
" in the near future , this type of simple laser communication might serve as a backup for the radio communication that satellites use , " @entity16 said in a statement			0
" in the more distant future , it may allow communication at higher data rates than present radio links can provide			0
" read more space and science news on @entity0 's @entity51 blog the enigmatic " @entity4 " countenance was digitized and traveled via laser almost 240,000 miles from @entity5 's @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56 , to the @entity57			2
satellites beyond @entity60 use radio waves for tracking and communication , but the moon satellite is the only one to rely on lasers for tracking , @entity5 said			0
@entity5 found a way to use that laser to deliver the " @entity4 " image to the satellite , which in turn confirmed its receipt by sending the image back to @entity60 using traditional radio telemetry			1
the image transmission was n't perfect and suffered defects because the @entity60 's atmosphere caused errors , even when the sky was clear , @entity5 said			0
scientists fixed the errors by using the same error - correction code used in cds and dvds , @entity5 said			0
the " @entity4 " experiment was transmitted at a slow data rate of about 300 bits per second , but the " pathfinding achievement sets the stage for ... high data rate laser - communication demonstrations that will be a central feature of @entity5 's next moon mission , the @entity91 , " said @entity54 's @entity92 , the orbiter 's deputy project scientist			1
researchers hope to uncover who 's behind the ' @entity4 '			0

@entity5 tests lasers in sending a digitized image of the " @entity4 " to space
a man - made satellite orbiting around the moon receives the image
the successful transmission marks a scientific first , @entity5 says
lasers now hold promise of high - speed , live video feeds throughout solar system
