@entity0 , @entity1 -- " stand to attention , " barked the class monitor as we walked into the classroom at the @entity6 , an hour 's drive from the county seat of @entity9 , a remote region in @entity10 's @entity1			1
on cue , the 30 or so second - grade pupils stood up and greeted us with wide grins and smiling eyes			1
i had joined a group of leading educators and volunteers from the @entity21 global network , which places volunteer teachers in disadvantaged schools in 32 different countries			0
they had gathered in @entity9 for their annual conference			0
we took a side trip to observe in one of the elementary schools that served @entity0 's 3,800 villagers and sat in on a mathematics class			1
to kick off the morning session , the female teacher asked volunteers to step forward and pretend to be " passengers " in a bus			0
several pupils " boarded " , a few got off , and a few more got on as the class shouted a running count of the " passengers			2
" the teacher spent the rest of the 40 - minute class teaching the basics of addition and subtraction , frequently leading the pupils in reciting drills			2
through the session , pupils sat still , listened attentively and answered questions often in unison			2
initially , i was put off by what seemed like rehearsed recitation and learning by rote			1
" old habits , " a local teacher said			0
but later , i understood why			0
" it has something to do with collective culture in @entity10 , " said @entity60 , a graduate of @entity61 , who had taught in public schools			1
" we ... believe in the importance of reciting repetitively			0
when a book is read a hundred times , a @entity10 idiom goes , its meaning becomes naturally clear			1
" that 's why from childhood we are taught to recite poetry -- you can at least recite , if not write , poetry			2
" for subjects like math , it 's helpful because it 's about remembering pithy formulas			2
teachers even make up doggerels ( rhymes ) to help memorize them			0
" for me , my experience in the @entity0 classroom illustrates the pros and cons of @entity10 's education system			1
" @entity10 schools excel in knowledge - based teaching , " said @entity92 , author of " @entity93 on @entity94			1
" " for subjects like math and grammar , this is very important , especially in a child 's early years of schooling			2
" @entity92 , who attended public schools while growing up in @entity103 , said this intense focus on academics " cultivates strong discipline , work ethics and stamina			2
" the @entity0 pupils impressed me and fellow observers as disciplined and well - behaved			2
when i took out my camera , they gladly posed and flashed @entity113 signs			0
many gathered around me to look at their digital photos			0
their eyes sparkled with curiosity			0
they exuded pent - up energy and hunger for knowledge			0
" except for the migrants , our kids are not as hungry , " noted an educator for @entity21 for @entity123			2
" here one billion people are hungry , trying to reach the top			2
" but this traditional teaching method has its downside			0
it emphasizes lectures and learning by rote , instead of more give - and - take in the classroom			1
as in many @entity10 schools , it 's mostly about tests and exams			1
" education was a series of hoops to jump through , not a process of self - improvement or self - discovery , " said @entity92 , the author			0
the " gaokao " system -- the annual nationwide college entrance and virtually the sole determinant whether a student goes to college -- has largely contributed to this blind cut - throat competition that involves students , parents and teachers			1
" for years leading up to gaokao , @entity10 kids are tested and ranked on a narrow set of subjects , leading to incessant and often bitter competition , " @entity92 explained			1
" this has engendered a society bent on self - promotion			0
" in some cases , experts said , that has led to cases of bribery and cheating during the exams			0
while @entity10 students may be strong in basic education and passing exams , they are weak in creativity and innovation			1
because the system is geared towards getting high scores in exams , students with special talents are often lost as " under - achievers			1
" many educators now acknowledge the system no longer suits the next stage of @entity10 's growth			1
they consider overhaul of the education system to be critical to @entity10 's economic growth and to achieving its goal of competing with the @entity190 and other advanced countries in science , technology and innovation			1
educational reforms still have a long way to go , but some changes are underway			1
to relieve students of heavy load , the @entity198 last august issued a 10 - point decree , stipulating fewer exams , no written homework , no teaching during spare time or holidays and a compulsory hour of physical exercise daily			0
a long - term blueprint for reform seeks to change the thrust of education by putting a premium on integrating " learning with thinking " , " learning with practice " and " teaching children according to their aptitude			1
" these goals require a change in mindset			0
" the knowledge economy does not pay for what you know but for what you can do with what you know , " said @entity219 , @entity220 special advisor on education policy			0
they also require massive investment in resources			0
for years , @entity10 spent only around 2 % of gross domestic product on education , compared with the minimum 6 % recommended by the @entity234			1
since 1993 , i have heard @entity10 leaders pledge to raise it to 4 % of gdp			1
it was only last year when they finally lived up to that promise .			0

pupils at remote rural @entity10 elementary school are *enthusiastic* and hungry to learn
rote learning still plays part in @entity10 's education system
@entity10 students strong in basic education but weaker in creativity
educational reforms still have a long way to go , but some changes are underway .
