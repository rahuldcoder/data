every december , foreign correspondents in @entity1 go through the rigmarole of renewing press cards and visas , which typically run out at the end of the year			1
this time around , @entity1 authorities held up renewing the credentials of roughly two dozen @entity8 and @entity10 reporters after the two @entity12 news outfits published muckraking stories about the wealth of the families of top @entity1 leaders			1
without renewed press cards , they could not renew their @entity1 visas			1
without the visas , reporters and their families would be forced to leave @entity1			1
" @entity24 , " @entity10 reporter @entity23 , tweeted on tuesday			0
timeline : journalists under pressure " do you think hauling all my stuff to gates of the @entity31 holding a tag sale will get their attention ? " after a tense wait , all @entity8 reporters and some of the @entity10 reporters picked up their renewed press cards on thursday			1
" we are in contact with @entity1 officials and remain hopeful that our resident journalists in the country will be issued visas that will allow them to continue to work there , " @entity10 spokesperson , @entity38 , told me by email			1
this is a welcome development , but to fellow reporters in @entity1 that 's a small consolation			1
" so we 've come down to this , " said @entity50 correspondent @entity49			0
" we rejoice over something that used to be routine			0
" working as a foreign correspondent in @entity1 sounds glamorous and rewarding , and quite often it is			1
we cover landmark events , interview fascinating personalities and travel to exotic places			0
but , as the visa controversy shows , it also involves a lot of hard work and hassles -- @entity1 ranks 173 out of 179 countries for press freedom , according to @entity67			1
early frustrations when i was just cutting my teeth as a foreign correspondent in the 1980s , the rules and regulations were so tight that it was difficult to get access to people and travel outside of @entity77			2
many places were not accessible to foreigners			0
a lot of information was deemed " neibu " , or for internal consumption only			0
a story done in one afternoon in most other beats would take weeks of waiting and gestation in @entity1			1
the protracted process often lead to unsatisfying results -- and frustrations			0
doing an enterprise story then was difficult and dangerous			0
i remember doing a story for @entity93 in the late 1980s			2
we traveled to rural @entity95 , @entity96 to follow up on reports of farmers rioting over local corruption			0
just minutes after we had started interviewing a group of farmers gathered in a home , three men in civilian clothes barged in and started to ask who we were and why we were there			0
we cut short our interview and hopped into our rented car			0
the local driver was as scared as i was			0
" those people can be ruthlessly violent , " he told me			0
technically , such reporting trips violated @entity1 's " 10 - day rule " , which required foreign journalists to secure permission from local " waiban " ( foreign affairs office ) 10 days in advance before we could conduct reporting outside our home base in @entity77 or @entity118			1
whenever we were caught doing so , @entity1 authorities gave us verbal reprimands or asked us to write " self - criticisms			1
" @entity1 is changing to be sure , the working conditions for foreign reporters have significantly improved compared to 1982 , when i started my career as a @entity1 correspondent			1
@entity1 has allowed more reporters into the country , allowing expanded coverage about varied , lighter aspects of @entity1 life			1
in 1977 , one year after chairman @entity134 's death , there were only 39 foreign reporters in @entity1			1
the number increased to about 100 when my @entity1 role began five years later			1
now , our ranks have expanded to nearly 700 working for 441 news outlets from 59 countries , mostly based in @entity77 and @entity118			1
we used to be focused on human rights issues and politics			0
now we report on a gamut of themes -- health , finance , @entity149 and fashion among them			0
over the years the restrictions have loosened , especially right before the @entity153 when @entity1 rescinded the 10 - day rule			1
we still face problems , especially in the provinces where officials have vested interests and narrow ways of viewing things			0
to them , foreign journalists -- and our reporting -- can create trouble for them , especially when we expose wrongdoings and abuses			1
local officials need to be told that the new normal is to allow us to conduct interviews and photo shoots freely			0
they need to understand how foreign journalists operate , why we do things a certain way , why we need information promptly and accurately			2
to be fair , there are many @entity1 officials i know who subscribe to this new mindset and have been trying hard to shake things up or do things differently			1
some of them are quite frustrated with the result of their efforts			0
" too much negativity , " complains one			0
" we have tried hard to give access to foreign journalists but their stories still end up negative			1
we do n't expect them to report like @entity1 journalists but we hope they will be just objective and even - handed			1
" i hope these officials will keep pushing forward , instead of backward			0
it will show a measure of self - confidence and will push @entity1 closer to the international norms and standards of media management			2
important future role indeed although it 's a lot easier now serving as a foreign correspondent there 's still much to be desired			2
in a year - end statement , the @entity206 of @entity1 noted " a number of negative trends over the past year			2
" their list includes : -- denial of visa to @entity213 , a long - time reporter known for his reporting on human rights ; -- new rules that stipulate the police may take a maximum of 15 business days to process visas , which means that reporters can not leave the country during this period ; and -- spontaneous designation of locations , such as @entity226 , where special permission is said to be required to film or report			2
web sites containing material considered sensitive by the @entity1 government are often blocked			2
cable television channels such as @entity235 and the @entity236 are closely monitored and sensitive topics are routinely blacked out			0
we , as media , must also remain vigilant against self - censorship			2
i feel little personal risk as a reporter , but our biggest concern remains the protection of sources who are usually more vulnerable to the government 's control			2
none of us wish to land them in jail			0
@entity1 is a crucial news beat for @entity235 and our audience			1
as the country evolves into a freer , more pluralistic society , the importance of covering @entity1 in all its many facets will only grow			1
there is a lot about the country , its people and culture our audience wants to know			0
however , we can not talk about the world 's most populous country -- and the world 's second biggest economy -- while avoiding inconvenient issues and unpleasant subjects			2
as journalists , we are bearers of news , both good and bad			2
we just ask : do n't shoot the messenger .			0

two dozen @entity1 journalists in tense wait for reporting visas after controversial stories
reporting from @entity1 both rewarding and frustrating , says @entity280
journalist working conditions have improved since 1980s
