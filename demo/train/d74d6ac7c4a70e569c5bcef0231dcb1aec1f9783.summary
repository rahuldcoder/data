if you 're planning on packing up and changing addresses to @entity2 - 442b or @entity2 - 438b anytime soon , you can probably put away the moving boxes for now			2
while the newly discovered exoplanets and their six friends hold the exciting possibility of being capable of supporting life , scientists wo n't know for sure for a while			1
the @entity2 made the discoveries , pushing the number of such exoplanets it has found to more than 1,000			2
the punch list , according to astronomers with the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , sounds good			0
they are not too close or too far from their star so that they might have water instead of ice or steam			0
they are about the right size , and they get a decent amount of sunlight			0
and they also might have the kinds of surface that could bear life			0
" most of these planets have a good chance of being rocky , like @entity39 , " lead author @entity34 of the @entity16 said in a release			1
which is a lot more hospitable that being a big ball of gasses			0
" we do n't know for sure whether any of the planets in our sample are truly habitable , " second author @entity44 of the @entity16 said in a release			1
" all we can say is that they 're promising candidates			0
" @entity50 and @entity2 - 442b are the most similar to @entity39 of any known exoplanets to date			1
and even if there was confirmation , @entity54 with the @entity16 said teams are " still a couple of generations of telescope development away , " from even seeing them , much less visiting			0
kepler - 438b is 470 light - years away and kepler - 442b is 1,100 light years away , according to @entity16			1
" that 's a little far away , " @entity62 said , " we need to get to @entity64 first			0
" still it 's very exciting just to discover them and to be closer to identifying a " second " @entity39			1
at a panel held last summer at @entity69 in @entity70 , astronomers said they were " very close in terms of technology and science to actually finding the other @entity39			2
" that 's due in part to the @entity2 telescope			0
the planet - hunting @entity2 probe , launched in 2009 , finds planets by looking for dips in the brightness of a star as a planet transits , or crosses , in front of that star			2
@entity54 said the team of scientists monitored data for more than 160,000 stars , which led them to the eight new planets			1
the couple most like @entity39 , @entity2 - 438b and @entity2 - 442b , both orbit red dwarf stars , which are cooler and smaller than the @entity39 's sun. @entity50 's diameter is 12 % bigger than @entity39 and has a 70 % chance of being rocky , which means the surface of the planet appears to be like @entity39 's			1
@entity60 is about one - third larger than @entity39 with a 60 % chance of being rocky			1
scientists give it a 97 % chance of being in the habitable zone , but caution that the estimates are n't certain			2
@entity69 stuns with new image of ' @entity108 ' @entity3 's @entity109 contributed to this report .			0

scientists find eight new planets in habitable **distance** from their stars
two of the eight are most similar to @entity39 of any known exoplanets
*observations* of these new planets is *difficult* due to their light - years **distance** away from @entity39
