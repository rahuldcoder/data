@entity1 former president @entity0 reflected on the months of protests that have swept across @entity4 in response to the deaths unarmed black men at the hands of law enforcement , saying in an interview airing friday that the country needs to make " people feel that everybody matters again			1
" " the fundamental problem you have anywhere is when people think their lives and the lives of their children do n't matter , they they are somehow disposable , just like a paper napkin after a lunch at a restaurant or something , " @entity0 told @entity14			1
" if we want our freedom to be in deed as well as word in @entity4 , we have to make people feel that everybody matters again			0
" @entity0 , who was in @entity31 for the @entity35 " future of the @entity34 " summit , argued that the two issues at play in the protests were whether law enforcement made the correct decisions and how police departments can improve their relationships with communities			1
in the last three weeks , grand juries have cleared police officers in the killing of @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52			0
@entity0 argued that in both cases , policing was an issue			2
" there is not any question in @entity48 , whatever the findings of the grand jury , if the law enforcement officer had not gone after the man and felt compelled to shoot him , he would be alive , " @entity0 said			1
and on @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity0 was clear to point out that " police policy was against putting someone in a choke hold			2
" during the interview with @entity66 at the @entity67 , @entity0 spoke at length about foreign policy throughout the @entity34 and the recent release of the @entity72 torture report			1
" i think this is just the beginning , " the former president said			0
" there will now be a real effort to find out what the details were and whether or not any other action is appropriate in that			0
" @entity0 has been getting used to playing second ( or possibly third ) fiddle in his family			0
@entity0 's wife , former secretary of state @entity84 is widely seen as the front - runner for the @entity88 nomination in 2016 and the recent birth of @entity91 's first child , @entity92 , has been the fascination of many			2
as is the case with every interview , @entity0 was asked about his wife 's presidential aspirations and when , in particular , @entity84 expects to announce her candidacy			2
" i do n't even know if she is going to run , " @entity0 said			0
" but if she , sometime next year i think she will make a decision and announce it			0
" the full interview with @entity0 will air on @entity14 at 6 p.m. et friday and on sunday at 8 p.m. et.			1
