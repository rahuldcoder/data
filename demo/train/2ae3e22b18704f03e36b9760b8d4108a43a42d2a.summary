-- on any given saturday , you 'll find a motley crew assembled outside the nondescript gray building on @entity4 , west of downtown @entity6			0
an elderly couple walks tentatively behind a large black @entity8 , a kid with chubby cheeks totes a feisty @entity11 , and a trio of teens bound out of their parent 's minivan with a brindle pit bull named @entity17 in tow			2
they join at least a dozen other pet owners for free obedience classes offered by the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) through its @entity24 program			0
designed to support people and pets in underserved communities , @entity25 welcomes all breeds			0
but an overwhelming majority of the four - legged students that arrive each week are pit bulls or pit mixes			1
on busy days , cars slow their pace and kids peer through the chain link fence to watch these muscular dogs work for treats alongside cocker spaniels , @entity42 terriers , and even an occasional poodle			0
the six - week training program ends with dogs taking the @entity47 test , followed by a graduation party where neighbors gather to watch students demonstrate new tricks			0
in less than a year , @entity22 has begun to chip away at the city 's perception of pit bulls as dog - fighting monsters			1
but the @entity57 - based organization faces a bigger battle in its own backyard			0
@entity61 's @entity60 ruled in august that pit bulls are " inherently dangerous			1
" the decision stems from a case involving a pit bull named @entity66 that escaped from its pen twice , severely injuring two children on the same day			2
plaintiffs sued the dog 's owner and the landlord			2
@entity61 's @entity60 ruling means that dog owners — and their landlords — are responsible for any injuries caused by pit bulls			1
( the ruling was a slight modification of an earlier decision that included pit bull mixes			2
) pit bull owners , rescue groups and nonprofit organizations have criticized the ruling , which places breed - specific legislation back in the spotlight			1
last december , retired police officer @entity88 and his pit bull service dog made headlines by challenging a breed ban in @entity92 , @entity93			1
according to the @entity95 with @entity96 , any breed can work as a service dog			1
the @entity95 @entity98 in @entity99 granted a temporary injunction , reuniting @entity101 and @entity88 , who credits his pit bull with detecting early signs of cancer			2
in july , the @entity106 allowed @entity107 to keep his dog			2
in the meantime , @entity61 pit bull owners — and their landlords — face tough choices			1
the @entity113 reports of early fallout from the ruling , including landlords threatening pit bull owners with eviction			2
@entity22 has responded with advice to renters who own pit bulls , along with links to pet - friendly rental properties on its website			1
@entity0 : @entity61 court declares pit bulls ' inherently dangerous ' wanted , pit - friendly housing @entity127 regularly leases her @entity61 property to pet owners , including pit bulls			1
she requires pets to be spayed or neutered and tenants must sign a lease addendum promising never to leave the dog outside unattended			2
dogs also should be up to date on vaccinations , and a @entity138 certainly helps			0
although she lives and works as an editor in @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity127 makes frequent visits to @entity61			1
even with these precautions , she was alarmed by the court ruling			0
" i do n't think pit bull owners should be locked out of the rental market , " says @entity127 , who has two pit bulls and one pit mix. " i do n't believe a pit bull as a breed is any more dangerous			1
i will judge each dog as an individual			2
if a person comes with a small white mutt and i think they wo n't be responsible , they are n't getting in			0
" the @entity157 for the @entity158 ( @entity159 ) also opposes @entity61 's ruling			1
its newly established legal advocacy department will target civil and criminal cases that could substantially impact animal welfare , providing support to attorneys and drafting bills for its government relations department , which will monitor legislation based on the recent court ruling			0
" it will have a really devastating impact on folks in @entity61 , " says @entity171 , vice president and chief counsel of the legal advocacy department			1
" it 's bad in a whole lot of ways , but maybe most importantly , it does n't do a lot to protect people from dogs of all breeds , it does n't put the onus on owners and it judges the dog			2
" she adds that dogs of any breed , even if friendly , can cause trouble if not properly supervised			2
@entity0 : pit bull takes hit from train to save her owner how did we get here ? every decade , a different breed gets labeled as the problem pooch , says dog trainer and police officer @entity200			1
in the ' 70s , he remembers @entity202 getting a bad rap , followed by @entity205 shepherds in the ' 80s and powerful rottweilers in the ' 90s			0
the @entity209 describes each breed as a protective and loyal family pet that requires lots of exercise			2
its description of pit bulls , also known as @entity217 terriers , is no different			1
" the @entity218 is a people - oriented dog that thrives when he is made part of the family and given a job to do , " according to the @entity209 site			2

many of the cases involved unsocialized dogs that broke free from chains in the back yard			0

but there are other dogs out there attacking people			0
they just do n't get publicity			0
" @entity0 : 7 of the most loyal dogs changing perceptions @entity200 recommends that pit bull owners enroll in training courses and walk their dogs regularly , at least three times a week , to help the dog burn energy and avoid destructive behavior			1
he says the breed can be easy to train because pit bulls love pleasing their owners			1
" unfortunately , people are not doing that , and it 's given pit bulls a bad name , " he says			1
" they look at the color and say ' i want that one , ' " he says			0
" people get a willful pit bull or a pit bull puppy and do n't have time to work with it , then the dog gets bored			1
if you do n't have time to spend with a dog , you do n't want a pit bull			1

" as founder and president of the @entity342 , @entity343 carefully vets prospective dog owners before adopting out pit bulls			1
she offers plenty of information about the breed , along with a laundry list of dos and don'ts			0
" i want to make sure that whomever i adopt to is educated about the breed , " she says			0
" we want to make sure they understand the stigma about the breed and that they are held to a higher standard			0
i tell people right off the bat , if you want a dog park type dog , a dog you can just run off - leash , please do not get a pit bull			1

" as a landlord , i feel even more responsible than if i lived in the house			0
i tend to be maybe a little more diligent			0
