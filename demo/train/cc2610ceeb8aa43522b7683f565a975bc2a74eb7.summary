-- @entity1 , a 38 year - old publicist in @entity2 , @entity3 , was diagnosed with genital herpes in 1997			1
since then , she has " kind of been hiding " from the dating scene			1
let 's face it : how do you drop that bomb on a potential love interest ? and when ? she considered a number of online dating venues , but she says @entity15 asked too many questions on its enrollment form , @entity14 was too " religious , " and @entity18 was too much of a " hookup zone			1
" " i wanted to meet men with my same diagnosis so we would n't [ need to ] have ' the talk , ' or fear of rejection and transmitting , " she says			0
" most of us with this do n't wish to spread it			0
" despite -- or perhaps because of -- the economic downturn , the billion - dollar online dating industry has been booming			1
but not everyone has felt welcome at the party			0
while sites like @entity15 and @entity14 do n't discriminate , they also do n't cater to people like @entity1 who are coping with sexually transmitted diseases , disabilities , or mental health conditions			1
all of these can make dating -- often an ego - shattering minefield for those in perfect health -- even trickier			1
" on bigger dating sites the competition is tremendous , " says @entity46 , @entity47 , a clinical psychologist and columnist for @entity49			1
" and let 's face it , depending on what [ the illness ] is , it could very well make you uncompetitive in the larger dating pool			1
" @entity0 : 28 days to a healthier relationship fortunately , there are a number of alternatives			0
a new breed of dating sites has emerged to play cupid for people with chronic diseases and disabilities			1
over the past five years , several sites -- such as @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72 -- have launched to serve the needs of people with conditions ranging from bipolar disorder to @entity78 's disease			1
together these sites now boast tens of thousands of members			2
in addition to providing their users with a more hospitable environment , these websites defuse the tension over how and when to disclose an illness , which is often an issue for people with diseases and disabilities who venture onto mainstream dating sites			1
when health problems equal heartache after some " horrible " results on other dating websites , @entity1 joined @entity97 and the @entity99 - specific site @entity100			1
both sites require members to disclose their illnesses upfront , clearing the air for what might be a deal - breaking revelation later			1
within her first week on @entity107 , she went on three dates and has since gone on seven more , which fostered one romantic relationship and a friendship over the past two years			0
she 's even rejected a couple dozen guys			0
@entity0 : how to tell your partner a health secret " i do n't think i would have been able to have 10 dates without the site , " says @entity1			1
" it 's easier to get rejected via email , and you can take baby steps online without hunting outside			2
" though @entity97 did n't yield any dates for @entity1 , this fast - growing online community offers an alternative to mainstream dating sites for thousands of singles			1
now three years old , the site currently has 8,000 members who represent nearly 40 health conditions ranging from genital herpes ( 2,425 members ) to @entity133 's syndrome ( 32 members )			1
@entity135 founded @entity136 in 2006 , inspired by his late brother @entity137 , who lived with @entity78 's disease for 15 years before passing away in 2004			0
" he was a good - looking boy , and he could find dates , but when do you tell someone you have a colostomy bag ? the night you go out ? two weeks after you go out ? " @entity135 asks			2
" he was having a hard time with that , so i thought if he could find someone who had the same disease , or someone with a colostomy bag , he would n't really have to discuss that			0
" since launching the site , @entity135 , 48 , who previously dabbled in the stock market and worked as a bartender , was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes			2
though he does n't find it appropriate to be a member of a community he founded , he says he can empathize with his members			0
" it 's nice to find someone who 's going through what you 're going through , " he says			0
love for less niche sites are also a lot less expensive			2
@entity97 , which started charging in may 2009 , is $ 9.95 per month , while most of the features on @entity169 ( including the dating service and chat rooms ) are still free			1
( access to the site 's full features is available for $ 24 per year			2
that 's substantially cheaper than sites like @entity15 and @entity14 , which can cost upwards of $ 35 per month			2
) " to me , that 's pressure right there , " says @entity178 , the executive director of the nonprofit dating service @entity180 , which caters primarily to those with physical and mild psychiatric handicaps			2
" if it 's the 30th day of the month , you 're thinking , ' i 've got one more day to find someone or it 's another $ 35			0
' " @entity189 , which was founded in 1987 by a @entity191 , doctor who wanted to give her patients a way to combat the isolation that accompanied their physical disabilities , charges a $ 125 initiation fee for the first year and $ 25 every year thereafter			0
for that fee , members get a more personalized experience , as @entity189 is more akin to an old - school matchmaking service			2
the organization has been responsible for almost 1,000 marriages , according to @entity178			0
as one of its first members , he should know : he met his wife , @entity207 , at a @entity209 party in 1988			0
" i did n't want to try it , " says @entity178 , who has moderate cerebral palsy and was working as a national project director for the @entity212 at the time			0
" but i probably knew everybody in my community and nobody i knew wanted to date me or vice versa			0
@entity207 lived 60 miles away , but we made it work			0
" by pushing a " friends first " concept , which has been emulated in the communal blog and forum features of @entity97 , @entity169 , and other illness - specific sites , @entity189 members can get up to speed on the dating world in a familiar environment without the prying eyes of the @entity232			1
" people with disabilities , especially developmental disabilities , are typically behind the eight ball because they have n't had the practice of dating in college or their young adult life , " says @entity178			1
" many of them never had the puppy love , been broken up with , experienced the fights , or the good stuff			0
" to make up for this lost time , his best bit of advice is to be totally honest			0
even in our post-americans with @entity250 society , notes @entity178 , failing to mention that you 're confined to a wheelchair or dealing with another type of handicap might bring a first date to an abrupt end after a courtesy " i 'm sorry " drink			0
the stigma of mental illness people with physical disabilities are n't the only ones who face stigma while dating			1
people with mental health problems , from chronic depression to schizophrenia , have also benefited from specialized sites			1
@entity271 , 39 , a college librarian from @entity272 , @entity273 , has lived with schizoaffective disorder , a condition that combines features of schizophrenia and mood disorders ( such as depression ) , since 1992			0
in 2004 , after years of brushing up against the harsh realities of the dating scene , @entity271 founded no @entity169 , a dating site that caters to the mentally ill. " i thought to myself , ' there should be something like this out there , ' and i was surprised to find there was n't , " says @entity271			1
" if you 're mentally ill , it 's kind of a hostile world out there			0
i thought by taking down that whole bugaboo of having an illness , making it all open with everyone knowing , it would facilitate things			0
people would be more trusting and relationships might be more successful			2
" no @entity169 now has 16,000 members and a brand new interface ( similar to those of social - networking sites ) that allows users to upload poems , art , videos , and blogs			1
the site has been responsible for more than 20 marriages			2
" i find with my clientele , they 're more willing to get to know someone remotely and they 're more open , " he says			0
" they do n't have the same kind of prejudices that people in general tend to have			2
" even though most mental illnesses can be controlled with medication , therapy , or a combination of the two , some people still view conditions such as bipolar disorder as a mark of weakness or instability			1
" even in today 's enlightened society , where acceptance and diversity are hailed as the right thing to do ... mentally ill people tend to be outcasts			2
it 's terrible , " says @entity46 , who is also a former instructor of clinical psychiatry at the @entity337			0
" the minute someone knows you have a certain mental disorder , they assume it means that you 're not capable of love , or that you 're dangerous or unstable			2
given the right care , people with mental illnesses and other medical conditions can lead very normal , functioning lives			1
" some mental illnesses -- certain mood or personality disorders , for instance -- could cause problems in fledgling relationships , @entity351 acknowledges			1
and especially if the relationship progresses to thoughts of marriage and kids , two partners who each have bipolar disorder , for example , could find themselves debating whether it 's safe or wise to have children			0
however , says @entity46 , in most cases these considerations are n't enough to forestall a relationship			0
" even under the best of circumstances , people still have major relationship challenges , " he says			2
for @entity351 , this outgrowth of illness - specific dating sites and services is a boon			1
" niche sites are growing in popularity because they allow people with these very specific needs or interests to connect in a way that 's not possible on the big dating sites , " he says			1
" the big dating sites are akin to @entity387			1
you have a lot of quantity , but that does n't mean you 're going to find people with a lot quality in the way you define it			0
that being said , niche sites by their very construction tend to be very small			0
so i always advocate [ that ] people use both			0

billion - dollar online dating industry has been booming despite recession
sites include @entity97 and @entity99 - specific site @entity100
people with mental health problems also benefited from specialized sites
