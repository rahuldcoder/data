-- there 's a new url in town , and it has the potential to help hundreds of thousands of unemployed @entity5 still trying to regain their footing in a slow economy			0
the site , at www.universe.jobs and recently expanded by the @entity10 , is a clearinghouse of job listings that aims to create both a unified platform and one - stop shopping for both employers and employees			1
what makes the initiative different from more commonly known sites such as monster.com and careerbuilder.com ? employers pay big money on these sites in order to reach a broader audience			0
jobs universe is free to both small and big business			1
the aim , according to @entity30 of @entity31 , which is the licensed operator of the			0
jobs doman , is to create " a trusted , valued source where job seekers and the people who have the jobs -- the employers -- can connect seamlessly under one intuitive url			1
" here 's how it works : companies build their own websites on the			1
jobs domain , and the sites are updated daily			1
potential employees can then search those listings , but they do so under specific links depending on both region and the type of work they seek			1
for instance , a professional looking for new employment in the city of @entity54 would search under www.boston.jobs			2
cities with a population of 5,000 or above are searchable			0
only interested in listings in the technology field ? type www.technology.jobs in your browser			2
jobs domains that were functioning at the end of january , all through universe.jobs			2
according to @entity71 , executive director of @entity10 -- a nonprofit human resources consortium -- 580 @entity70 companies have already responded and are actively posting jobs on the site			1
in turn , the passive or active job seeker will know that these listings come from a " highly trusted source ... where they can go and feel that they are not getting jobs that are duplicates or scams , older or expired jobs , " @entity71 said			1
listings are updated at a minimum of once a day , and 41 states are currently represented on the site			2
eventually , programmers aim to expand throughout the globe			0
some , such as not - for - profit @entity90 , see this as a way for companies to look outside the realm of candidates they normally recruit , giving them a much broader audience , said @entity99 , a spokeswoman for the company providing health care services in @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			0
and @entity107 , a recruiter at @entity109 - based @entity108 , a provider of ip transit networks , said gone are the days when companies simply posted their listings and then looked around for ways to fill them			0
now , " we 're starting to build a talent pool of people that , even if you are n't right for that immediate job today ... you might be in the future			0
we are trying to change the way we approach the job seeker , " @entity120 said .			0
