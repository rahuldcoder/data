-- @entity1 hopes memories of last year 's @entity4 defeat to @entity5 will spur @entity6 on when the latest series begins in @entity8 on thursday			1
@entity1 suffered his second reverse as captain in cricket 's oldest battle , both coming in the northern hemisphere			1
after the 2005 setback he was able to bounce back immediately with a 5 - 0 trouncing of the tourists , and this time he will lead out 10 of the 11 players who he made go onto the field at @entity19 after losing by 197 runs to surrender the @entity4 urn			1
" i made sure they all got down on the ground and they all took in our own disappointment , more the @entity28 excitement , " the 35 - year - old told the @entity31 @entity30			1
" i made sure that it hurt them as much as possible when the @entity4 were being handed over to @entity34 at @entity35			2
there 's no doubt that 's what 's been driving certainly me , after all the work that i 've done , but every one of the players as well			0
" it 's about that empty feeling we had in our stomachs after walking off the @entity19 again , after two successive @entity4 tours			2
we want to make sure we do n't have that feeling again			0
" @entity6 's only change from that game sees left - arm spinner @entity46 brought in to make his test debut , with @entity50 not selected			1
vice-captain @entity51 has been passed fit after recovering from a minor back problem			1
@entity6 have not been beaten at the @entity54 ground since 1988 , and have lost just two series at home in the past 20 years			1
" history suggests that for every touring team coming to @entity6 they generally find here and @entity61 the places harder to adjust and adapt to , " @entity1 said			1
" @entity5 have been here a while , and in @entity64 last week it seamed around a little bit			2
but history suggests we handle these conditions very , very well -- and opposition teams struggle a bit			0
" @entity34 is seeking to become the first @entity5 captain to bring the @entity4 back from @entity72 since @entity73 in 1986 - 87			1
" it 's a very strong home ground for @entity6			1
but i think the prospect of maybe turning that record around excites us , " he said ahead of the first of five tests			0
" we had a similar record to contend with at @entity82 's last year -- and we were able to turn that around			2
if the guys put their minds to it , it could be potentially a very good start to the series to maybe overcome that record			0
" in past years , @entity6 have really hit the ground running in the first test match			2
they 've made a conscious effort to go hard at the opposition , and there 's no doubt the conditions here are slightly alien to a lot of touring sides -- especially touring sides that are maybe a bit undercooked or under - prepared			0
" but we know what to expect			0
we 've been out here for a while now , we 've had a good look at a lot of the @entity107 conditions			0
" we have n't had a particular look at the conditions at the @entity54 yet			0
but we know how it plays and what types of shots to look to play and which ones to avoid			0

@entity5 seeking to *retain* @entity4 urn in five - @entity117 series starting in @entity8
@entity6 captain @entity1 still *haunted* by 2 - 1 defeat in @entity5 last year
home team *boosted* by return to fitness of vice-captain @entity51 after back injury
@entity5 have not won a series in @entity6 since 1986 - 87 under @entity73
