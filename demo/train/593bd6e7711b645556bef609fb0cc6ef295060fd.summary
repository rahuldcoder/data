-- last february , tens of thousands of moviegoers stormed cinemas around the @entity3 to watch " @entity4 , " turning the superhero thriller into a surprise hit that topped the @entity3 box office on @entity8 weekend			2
the film , which follows the adventures of three @entity3 teenage boys who acquire superpowers , made $ 22 million that weekend alone -- traditionally considered one of the slowest weekends for the @entity3 movie industry			0
although set in @entity17 , " @entity4 's " producers decided to shoot in @entity18 , lured by the country 's low production costs and growing reputation as an attractive destination for international filmmaking			1
the move paid off as the film , with production costs of just $ 12 million , turned out to be a big winner for @entity28			0
" @entity4 " exceeded industry expectations by piling up an impressive $ 126 million in global cinema ticket sales , according to @entity31			2
" @entity35 was totally stunned by it , " says @entity32 , chief executive of @entity33 , the @entity18 facility where " @entity4 " was primarily shot			1

the multi-million dollar complex , the first of its kind in @entity18 , boasts four soundstages , several offices , a cinema , as well as pre- and post-production services			2
less than two years after it first began operations , the vast studios have already attracted an impressive roster of blockbuster films			0
apart from " @entity4 " they were used for action movie " @entity90 , " starring @entity82 and @entity83 , the @entity85 comic - book adventure " @entity86 , " and tv drama " @entity88 , " starring @entity89			1
@entity32 says the studios are a huge step for @entity18 's movie industry and will help the country to build its reputation as an emerging force in global filmmaking			1
" it creates a home , a base , where national and international filmmakers can meet , " says @entity32 , " where you can bring the latest technology together ; where you can bring films like ' @entity86 , ' which was our first film of 3d transfer movies -- so you can now suddenly shoot stuff that we can only dream from			2

earlier this year , the @entity18 government recognized this potential by announcing a series of incentives aimed at attracting large - budget productions to help create jobs , generate revenues and encourage tourism			1
the measures included an uncapped 20 % rebate for foreign productions shot on location in @entity18 , as well as a 22.5 % break if they are also post-produced in the country			1
@entity133 , managing director of @entity18 production firm @entity134 , says the incentives have already made a big difference			2
" we already have three productions for january -- up from maybe one or two productions a year the previous years -- and we 've got more lined up , " he says			0
" all the production companies in @entity18 have experienced an increase in films that they are doing and television programs but also increased inquiries from people who want to come and shoot here			0
" @entity133 cites the weakness of the rand against the dollar , the low cost of crews compared to other popular shooting destinations such as @entity152 , and the diversity of locations as @entity18 's competitive advantages			2
" we have both summer and winter rain in two different parts of the country , " he explains			0
" you can shoot the @entity162 climate around @entity41 and you can shoot the tropical climate in @entity164 -- it 's desert , as well as jungles , as well as beaches , it 's urban centers where they shot ' @entity86			2
' " so there 's very few films that ca n't be made here -- other than possibly a film shot completely in snow , in the @entity175 or something			0
