@entity0 , @entity1 -- documents showing that @entity6 offered to sell arms to @entity8 in the waning days of his rule are " the real deal , " a senior member of @entity1 's transitional government said monday			1
the comment follows a report by @entity15 's @entity14 newspaper saying that state - controlled @entity6 arms manufacturers were prepared to sell at least $ 200 million worth of weapons to @entity8 , which would have violated @entity20 resolutions banning such transactions			1
@entity14 said one of its reporters found the documents , in @entity24 , in a pile of trash in @entity0 's @entity28 neighborhood , an enclave that was home to some of @entity8 's most loyal supporters			1
the documents , which were posted sunday on the website of the @entity35 - based newspaper , do not confirm whether any military assistance was delivered to @entity1			2
however , @entity1 's @entity37 said it appears deliveries might have been made			0
" we found several documents that showed us orders , very large orders , of arms and ammunition specifically from @entity6 , and now we do know that some of the things that were on the list are here on the ground , and they came in over the last two to six months , " said @entity39 , @entity37 spokesman			1
he said it is unclear whether the exact list on the document was delivered , " but there were many things on that list that are here , and these are brand - new equipment , brand - new weapons , brand - new boxes of ammunition that have n't been opened yet , that were clearly delivered only in the last few months			0
" do n't forget that we have many of the generals and high commanders who defected some time ago who know @entity8 's regime very , very well , know what he has and does n't have , and we know 100 % that there was a lot of weapons and arms that were delivered to @entity8 over the last few months -- during the war and during the sanctions , " @entity39 said			1
and @entity73 , a member of the @entity37 , said @entity1 's new leaders have seen the documents			0
" this deal is a real deal and we have seen the official documents , " he said			0
" it was signed by @entity6 officials , and it was to send guns and artillery to @entity1 through @entity84 to expedite the deal			1
" @entity6 says it followed @entity86 resolutions that banned the export of arms to @entity8 's government			1
" the @entity8 regime sent people to @entity6 to engage in contact with certain individuals of relevant @entity6 companies in july without the knowledge of the @entity6 government departments , " @entity90 , a spokeswoman for @entity6 's @entity91 , told @entity2			1
" @entity6 companies have not signed any military trade contracts with @entity1 -- let alone provided military exports to @entity1			1
" the report comes after fighters from the @entity37 overran @entity0 and ousted @entity8 , whose whereabouts remained unknown			1
in a phone interview with the @entity108 - based @entity107 television network , a man identified as @entity8 spokesman @entity110 declared the fugitive @entity1 strongman " remains patient " and planning a counterattack against the rebel movement that drove him from power			1
" i tell the @entity1 people not to surrender to the gangs and that the end is near , " @entity110 said late monday			2
transitional government troops are perched on the outskirts of one of @entity8 's last bastions of support , with @entity1 's new leaders giving @entity8 loyalists in @entity126 , @entity127 and a handful of other towns until saturday to surrender or face attack			1
but @entity110 said there was " ongoing resistance " in areas that @entity8 has lost , and that @entity8 " is inside of @entity1 fighting			2
" " the @entity1 forces are still present , " he said			0
" we will protect the liberated cities and will get back the cities that were robbed from us , in a legal way and at the right time			0
" meanwhile , the @entity37 says it is moving its headquarters from @entity142 to @entity0 this week to begin implementing its plans for a new future for @entity1			2
and the @entity146 government announced monday that it had re-established its diplomatic mission in @entity0 , led by an acting special representative , @entity148			1
" the arrival of this team marks another significant step in the @entity146 's relations with the new @entity1 , and reflects the progress the @entity37 has made in improving security and stability on the ground , " foreign secretary @entity149 said in a statement announcing the move			2
the documents @entity37 officials were examining monday detailed a trip by @entity8 's security officials to @entity165 on july 16 during which they met with four state - controlled weapons manufacturers , the newspaper reported			2
" the companies suggest that they make the contracts with either @entity170 or @entity171 , because those countries previously worked with @entity6 , " the documents say			1
according to the newspaper , the documents show the @entity6 companies noted that many of the items wanted by @entity8 were in @entity170 and could quickly be moved across the @entity1 border			1
the @entity6 said they would replace the @entity170 arms sent to @entity1 , the document said			1
@entity39 said @entity182 , @entity37 chairman , has " made it very , very clear that anybody who has helped and supported and stood by @entity8 over the months would not be greeted well			0
" @entity6 abstained from voting on a @entity86 resolution in march that authorized the protection of @entity1 civilians by any means necessary , with the exception of a ground invasion			2
@entity6 , however , did approve a @entity86 resolution that banned military assistance , including the sale of weapons , to @entity8 's government			1
@entity6 , @entity170 and @entity171 have opposed the @entity194 bombing campaign in @entity1 , and the three countries were slow to recognize the authority of the @entity37 as @entity1 's legitimate authority			2
@entity73 said the @entity37 was amazed that the deal was discussed at a time when @entity8 's forces were killing " thousands and thousands of @entity1 , and it was done by two @entity20 members " who signed the arms embargo			1
" we will not forget but we will forgive , and we will start all over again , " @entity73 told @entity2			0
@entity8 's wife , two sons and other relatives fled to @entity170 recently , deepening mistrust between the @entity37 and @entity1 's neighbor			2
@entity170 said it acted on humanitarian grounds , but it angered the @entity37			0
the transitional council has accused @entity170 of supporting the @entity8 regime			0
@entity170 also complained to the @entity20 about damage done to their embassy soon after @entity37 fighters entered @entity0			0
@entity170 will in the future recognize the @entity37 as the government in @entity1 , @entity170 foreign minister @entity219 told @entity221 radio network @entity222 1 last week			0
" the @entity37 has said it is going to set up a government representative of all regions , and when it has done that , we 'll recognize it , " @entity219 said			0
meanwhile , the @entity91 on monday said 23 @entity228 citizens working at @entity1 oil industry facilities were arrested			0
no official charges have been filed , the ministry said in a statement , adding that because of the fighting in the @entity1 capital , the @entity37 is looking at all foreigners in @entity0 with suspicion			2
the @entity236 in @entity0 and the ministry are rendering proper consular assistance to those arrested , the ministry said			0
as a result , one person was released on sunday and the others are undergoing security checks , according to the statement			0
" @entity236 officials are regularly visiting our citizens , examining their conditions and pursuing active steps for their liberation and further return home , " the ministry said			0
@entity228 news agencies on monday quoted @entity253 spokesman @entity252 as telling reporters that those detained have food and water and there is no threat to their lives			0
@entity2 's @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 contributed to this report .			0
