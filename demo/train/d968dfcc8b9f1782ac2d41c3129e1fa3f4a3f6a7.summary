to actually challenge a ticket on our own			0
avoid a moving violation conviction even if it means paying a bigger fine			1
there are some alternatives , however			0
plead guilty -- with explanation sometimes you can get a reduced charge by pleading guilty -- but with an explanation			1
provided you have an otherwise clean record -- and the charge itself is relatively minor -- often , this can yield good results			2
remember -- what they want most is money			0
the charge itself is of secondary importance			0
a great deal depends on the judge , however			0
some are hard cases , others more reasonable			0
before you decide to go this route , it 's smart to get to court early and watch how your judge handles other cases -- especially those similar to your own			1
if you think , based on his actions , that he 's going to throw the book at you -- you can always request a continuance ; in many states , these are granted automatically upon request			1
simply tell the judge you are not ready to go to trial			0
a continuance will push your court date off for another few weeks or so and give you time to prepare a defense -- or hire a lawyer			2
bargain traffic courts are a lot like buying a new car -- because there 's lots of haggling involved			2
you can ask the judge ( or the prosecuting / commonwealth 's attorney ) about the possibility of agreeing to attend driving school and / or pay a fine in return for dropping the charge against you -- or changing the charge to a non-moving violation , which avoids @entity70 " points " being assigned to your driving record			1
that means your insurance company wo n't have a pretext for a rate hike			0
in some counties / states , certain charges are n't reported to the @entity80 at all -- especially if it 's an out - of - state ticket			1
( mostly , these include non-moving violations such as " defective equipment " -- a common " lesser charge " that 's often assigned in lieu of the original moving violation			1
) the key thing , however , is to avoid the moving violation conviction -- even if it means paying a larger fine than you 'd otherwise have paid for just the ticket / offense you were originally charged with			1
a one - time hit to your wallet is infinitely preferable to having that ticket held against you for anywhere from three to five years -- the length of time it will be on your @entity80 record -- and used by your insurance company to justify higher premiums			1
the total cost of a single moving violation on your @entity80 record can easily exceed the one - time hit of a fine for " defective equipment " ( or whatever ) many times over			1
and keep in mind : if you should be unlucky enough to receive another ticket before the old one " drops off " -- your jeopardy has just doubled			0
the points stack up -- and your insurance goes through the roof			0
how likely is it you can go for another five years without getting nailed again ? for many of us , that 's a virtual impossibility ! it 's possible in some states to take the @entity80 - authorized " driving school " online -- and avoid the hassle of spending an entire saturday reliving high school detention			1
bottom line either of these alternatives -- pleading guilty with an explanation or bargaining your way to a lesser charge -- can be more cost - effective than hiring a lawyer or spending days / weeks of your own time doing what 's necessary to fight the ticket yourself			1
most of us have jobs and responsibilities that make that very difficult , if not impossible			0
and it can be very intimidating for a layman to go up against the system , subpoenaing records , questioning the ticketing officer in open court -- and so on			2
by challenging the system in this way , one also runs the very real risk of antagonizing the court -- and becoming the target of an angry judge looking to " teach someone a lesson			1
" it 's true you can always appeal a conviction ( in many states , a traffic law case may even entitle you to a jury trial , if you want to take it that far )			2
but that involves yet more time , yet more expense			0
how much of either can you afford to spend on a traffic ticket beef ? yes , there 's the principle involved			0
if it 's a really unjust ticket , you may be motivated to go all the way -- and do whatever it takes to beat the rap			2
but sometimes , it 's smart to pick your battles -- and go for the best outcome you can realistically hope for given time and other constraints			0

sometimes you can reduce a charge by pleading guilty -- with an explanation
it 's possible in some states to take the @entity80 - authorized " driving school " online
avoid the moving violation conviction -- even if it means paying a larger fine
if trying to bargain , be careful of the very real risk of antagonizing the court
