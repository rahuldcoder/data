-- @entity2 's tumultuous political process took another dramatic turn thursday when its @entity4 effectively dissolved parliament , ruling that the election of one - third of its members last year was unconstitutional			1
the court also ruled that former prime minister @entity9 can remain a presidential candidate in this weekend 's runoff election , despite his close association with the former regime			0
these back - to - back rulings have immediately strengthened the hand of the " old guard " at the expense of the @entity18 , who held more than 70 % of the seats in parliament before it was dissolved			1
while some @entity22 leaders are referring to the court 's decisions as a " full - fledged coup , " it is more accurate to see recent events as an energetic " counter-revolution			2
" @entity2 's presidential runoff to go ahead despite concerns the remnants of the establishment , including the economically privileged military and the @entity34 - appointed judiciary , are flexing the powers they never gave up to make sure they remain in control			1
the now dissolved parliament was supposed to establish a 100 - member @entity39 to draft a new constitution ; instead , the military has announced that it will determine the composition of the committee			1
the constitution will determine such critical issues as how much power the president will wield , the role of @entity49 in society , and what oversight a civilian government will have over the military			2
in a sign of the military 's intentions , it proposed in november that its budget be outside civilian scrutiny , sparking outrage and denunciations from opposition leaders who vowed to reign in military power			2
now , the transition from military to civilian rule is back to square one			0
on wednesday , the ruling @entity68 also issued a decree giving the military police and intelligence service the right to detain civilians and send them to military tribunals			2
essentially , the decree replicates the dreaded @entity77 law that was in effect for most of the past 30 years under @entity34 until it was overturned on may 31			0
the security forces are clearly girding for another round of massive street protests by @entity2 's revolutionaries when they rally to resist the counter-revolution			2
some @entity2 pin the blame for the current setback on the @entity22 's political overreach			1
in the parliamentary elections last december , it ran candidates affiliated with its @entity91 for seats reserved for independents , helping it win a larger share of seats			0
this was one of the explanations for the @entity4 's ruling invalidating those seats and dissolving parliament			1
also , after insisting it would not run a presidential candidate , the @entity22 did join the presidential race			0
its candidate , @entity106 , led the field in the general election last month and will compete against @entity9 in the runoff election , which starts tomorrow			0
however , while the @entity22 's growing political influence certainly disquieted the establishment , the reality is that the powerful military , which has run @entity2 for decades , was never going to simply hand over power to a civilian government and fade into the background			1
analysts : ' soft coup ' court ruling could reignite @entity2 revolution for now , the @entity22 has not called for protests , and @entity2 's cities on friday were relatively calm			1
the @entity22 and various leaders of the youth movement have vowed to fight the counter-revolution , and they have the power to bring millions of people back into the streets to do so			1
undoubtedly , there are behind - the - scenes negotiations occurring as @entity22 leaders meet with the @entity68 to figure out what influence they can now expect			0
@entity2 's stability now rests on whether they can come to some accommodation that will lead to a gradual transition acceptable to the major players			0
the military must recognize that its attempts to reverse the democratic transition will eventually fail			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .			0

@entity143 : @entity145 in @entity2 has *reasserted* control with ruling dissolving parliament
she says @entity22 held most seats , now military will oversee constitutional committee
she says military was never really going to hand over power ; this showdown was inevitable
@entity159 : millions could return to streets ; military must know it will fail to stop democracy
