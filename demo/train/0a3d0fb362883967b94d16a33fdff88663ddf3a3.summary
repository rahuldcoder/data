it 's friday the 13th , and a full moon is in the offing			0

even if @entity16 had driven down the sidewalk from the opposite side of the building , the sidewalk bottlenecks right before @entity7			1
it 's about 5Â½ - feet wide at that point , so it 's difficult to imagine how a car could have traversed it			1

" while i do n't have additional info at the moment i feel it is safe to say that the car was on the road at some point and then left it , " @entity12 wrote in a later e-mail			0

the @entity86 has a @entity88 license plate			0
a reporter for @entity20 affiliate @entity90 in @entity8 asked the woman to provide details , to which she replied , " give me some money , i will , " before insulting the reporter , turning her back to her and saying , " get out of my face			2
" the driver was taken into custody and is charged with driving under the influence " less safe , " reckless driving and possession of marijuana , @entity12 said			1
a city jail official said friday morning that @entity16 was being held at the @entity103 detention facility , though @entity12 said in an e-mail both @entity16 and his passenger declined medical treatment			2
it was not immediately clear if @entity16 had retained a lawyer			2
by early afternoon , the area was cordoned off with yellow tape			0
