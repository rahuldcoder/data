-- on sunday night @entity1 put on a performance at @entity4 's @entity3 that appeared specifically contrived to elicit controversy and , by monday morning , sure enough the controversy had arrived			1
for those who missed it ( and in fact i missed it until compelled to watch it on @entity13 due to the controversy ) , @entity1 put on a performance that ranged from simply bizarre to crudely offensive , with plenty of twerking and rude gestures with a foam hand more reminiscent of a drunken frat party than good art. such a performance is bait , and i use that term on purpose , for the more sanctimonious set to thunder about the degradation of our society			1
outraged parents : @entity1 , what were you thinking ? as if on cue , the @entity34 , a nonprofit " watchdog " group and perennial foil of naughty media everywhere , issued a press release condemning the @entity40 , which , of course , succeeded in little more than drawing more attention to them			1
the council called also for legislation that would allow viewers to select cable stations buffet - style rather than getting stuck with multiple channels they do n't want			2
i 'm actually sympathetic to this kind of a la carte cable system ( although adult viewers should have the opportunity to select more adult - oriented channels if they wish and efforts to scrub cable clean seem nannyish )			0
on the other hand , if you went in watching the @entity40 , particularly with @entity58 headlining , with no clue you might see something shocking , you went in uninformed			0
first , let 's put things in perspective			2
were elements of the @entity40 artistically dubious and in poor taste , particularly if you ( somehow ) did n't see it coming ? absolutely			1
are they the end of civilization as we know it ? absolutely not			1
opinion : @entity1 is sexual -- get over it although it 's common to imply that media images such as these are harmful to minors , evidence for this has been inconsistent at best			1
two early studies linked watching sexy media with small increases in the likelihood of initiating sex earlier in the teen years			0
however , psychologists @entity86 and @entity88 reanalyzed one of the datasets and found that , with other variables properly controlled , the influence of sexy media was negligible			0
and we must remember that , though explicit media are probably more available now than at any time in history , teens have been having sex later than in previous generations , and becoming pregnant less often			0
we have to be careful not to mix moral outrage , which may be justified , with a public health crisis when one is not apparent			0
@entity1 upholds @entity40 tradition all of this outrage appears calculated to me , however ( it does n't help that @entity1 ' father sits on the board of advisers for the @entity34 )			1
the performers who do outrageous stuff do so on purpose because scandal sells			0
and " watchdog " groups themselves often thrive off outrage			2
such groups would wither financially if it were not for the public 's outrage and fear of media			2
the council 's website contains handy instructions on how not just to donate money but to include the group in your estate , give stocks , an automobile , etc. fairly common for advocacy groups to be sure , but it still gives them skin in the game			1
members of these groups may act in good faith , but let 's not mistake them for objective , financially uninterested parties			1
the irony is that likely all the furor has probably only encouraged teens to see what all the fuss is about on @entity13			0
if one is serious about reducing sexual content in the media , making a big fuss only draws attention			2
telling teens they should n't watch only makes them want to watch more			0
if you would like to see less of @entity155 ( and count me among those masses ) , the answer is quite simple : change the channel			0
we need less outrage , less nannying and more apathy toward such silliness			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			1

@entity166 : @entity1 ' performance seemed calculated to spark controversy
he says the act succeeded in drawing attention and provoking objections from watchdog group
was it in poor taste ? @entity166 says yes , but it 's not the end of civilization
@entity166 : there 's little reason to think these performances cause lasting harm
