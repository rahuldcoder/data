-- @entity2 president @entity1 defied expectations and dashed widespread hopes during an anticipated nationally televised speech wednesday when he made no mention of lifting a state of emergency			1
in his rambling 45 - minute speech to the @entity9 , he acknowledged that @entity2 want reform and that the government has not met their needs			1
making several references to an anti-syria " conspiracy " and threats to " stability , " @entity1 said strife can not win out over future reforms			2
" although president @entity1 did acknowledge the need for reform , his failure to address head - on the lifting of the state of emergency smacks of procrastination , " said @entity19 , @entity20 's deputy director for the @entity21 and @entity22			2
" he could declare this tomorrow if he wanted			0
" he should have immediately ordered his security forces to stop using unwarranted force and announced steps towards implementing key human rights reforms			0
" @entity36 deputy spokesman @entity35 said " the speech fell short of the type of reforms the @entity2 people demanded " and lacked substance			1
@entity42 made few concrete promises after weeks of anti-government demonstrations that have left at least 61 people dead , according to @entity46			1
the address " failed to commit to a specific reform agenda that would safeguard public freedoms and judicial independence and prohibit the @entity2 government from encroaching on human rights , " the group said			2
@entity54 , a spokeswoman for the @entity55 , told @entity0 the emergency law " will be lifted , " but she said procedures must be worked out			1
" the president presented his own vision " on an announced package of reforms , @entity58 said			0
details will come in a " limited time frame , " she added			0
asked if @entity2 received enough information , @entity58 said , " i would n't say the people expected more			2
" at least 16 people were killed after the speech in clashes in the city of @entity71 , which has been a center of unrest and the site of ongoing protests for the past few days , an eyewitness and an activist told @entity0			1
they said the deaths happened during clashes between anti-government demonstrators and security and army forces			1
@entity58 denied any deaths in the city			2
the eyewitness , who did not want to be named for security reasons , said protesters started gathering in central @entity71 's @entity91 after the speech and chanted , " no to sectarianism , we want freedom " and " we stand by @entity95 , " the southern city that has seen the most violence since anti-government protests started almost two weeks ago			1
as the crowd reached several thousand by the afternoon , they said , army personnel and security officers began shooting at the demonstrators			0
" @entity71 is tense and quiet tonight following the evening 's events , " the eyewitness said			1
" we are fearful because we have received today 's violence as a message from the regime coinciding with the president 's speech			2
" another eyewitness said protests erupted in the city of @entity111 , northwest of @entity95 , with thousands of demonstrators in the town square			0
he said he also heard about demonstrations in other nearby towns			0
@entity35 said the @entity2 should not interfere with planned friday demonstrations			0
@entity42 spoke a day after the @entity2 cabinet resigned amid an unusual wave of unrest across the nation			1
also wednesday , the @entity122 news agency reported two of its journalists are missing in @entity2			1
@entity122 quoted diplomatic sources as saying correspondent @entity126 , a @entity128 national based in @entity129 , had been detained by the @entity2 authorities in @entity131 on tuesday			1
the agency said photographer @entity133 , a @entity2 based in @entity131 , has not been in contact with colleagues since monday			0
a @entity2 official said authorities were working to establish what had happened to the two men , @entity122 reported , adding the agency is " deeply concerned " about their whereabouts			1
two other @entity122 journalists were detained by @entity2 authorities over the weekend			1
television producer @entity144 and cameraman @entity145 , both @entity146 , were expelled to @entity146 , @entity122 reported			1
@entity2 is the latest in a string of arabic - speaking nations beset with discontent over economic and human rights issues			0
in his speech , @entity1 said @entity2 's government will not fall like a domino in a string of @entity156 revolutions , saying that instead , @entity2 had kicked the dominoes of the " conspirators " and that they had fallen instead			1
@entity42 also blamed unrest in his country on " enemies ... working daily and scientifically to undermine the stability of @entity2			1
" he said they were " stupid in choosing to target @entity2			0
" " in principle , we support reform and meeting people 's needs , " the president said			2
" this is the duty of the state			0
but we can not be for sedition			0
" he referred obliquely to the anti-government demonstrations , calling them " a test of our unity			0
" @entity42 said , however , " we ca n't say that everybody who went out was part of the conspiracy			2
that would n't be accurate			0
" @entity2 is not isolated from what is happening in the @entity156 world			0
we are part of this region , " @entity1 said			0
" we influence and are influenced by it , but at the same time we are not a copy of other countries			0
" legislators in the @entity190 cheered the president when he arrived to begin the speech			2
the state - run @entity194 news agency had reported that @entity1 's speech would " tackle the internal affairs and the latest events in @entity2 " and " reassure the @entity2 people			1
" @entity42 did make a passing reference to the emergency law , in place for almost 50 years			1
" sometimes we can postpone a certain suffering that may be caused by the emergency law or any other law or necessary measures that the citizen endures , but we can not postpone the suffering of a child whose father can not treat him because he does n't have the money for his medication or when the state does not have this drug or this treatment , " he said			1
the law allows the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes			2
in effect since 1963 , it also bars detainees who have n't been charged from filing court complaints or from having a lawyer present during interrogations			0
@entity226 , a protester in @entity95 , called the president 's speech a disappointment because he did n't address demands , including lifting the emergency law			1
" we were hopeful prior to the speech but after , everyone was shocked			2
we were expecting much , much more , " he said			0
a @entity2 rights activist who goes by the @entity235 for security reasons said he and other @entity2 were disappointed			0
he said people are dying for freedom but the " martyrs " were n't mentioned			2
" for me now , at this time ... actually he said nothing , he did nothing for us , " @entity240 said			0
" all of what he said was that we are traitors , that we are working for foreign conspiracies against our country , ... that the @entity247 is behind this , what is going on in @entity2			0
" @entity20 's @entity19 said the group is " disturbed by reports that security forces could already be shooting on demonstrators in @entity71 who have been protesting against his speech			1
" @entity46 called on @entity1 to lift the state of emergency , amend a law that allows forces to punish people for peaceful expression , investigate security services and allow the registration of new political parties			1
@entity0 's @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 contributed to this report			0
