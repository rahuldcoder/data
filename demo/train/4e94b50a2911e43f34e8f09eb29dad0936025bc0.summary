@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 clad in the national colors of red , gold and green celebrated long into the night on friday as excitement over the national team 's penalty shootout victory over @entity11 in the final of the @entity14 - 20 @entity13 in @entity15 brought the @entity17 nation to a standstill			1
@entity1 's players celebrate their victory over @entity11			0
@entity1 's victory , 4 - 3 on penalties after a goalless draw which they had survived since the 37th minute with 10 men , was the first ever by an @entity17 side in the tournament			1
earlier , many football fans had converged in churches hours before the game to pray for divine intervention			0
but the triumph , coupled with @entity34 's disappointing performance in the tournament , may be the clearest signal yet that the balance of power in @entity17 may have tilted from @entity34 to @entity1 once again			1
last month @entity1 's @entity1 , featuring players like @entity40 midfielder @entity39 and @entity42 's @entity41 , became the first @entity17 side to qualify for @entity44			1
@entity34 are in danger of missing the @entity13 for the second time running			0
the @entity34 trail @entity46 by two points in @entity48 ahead of their last group qualifying matches on november 11 when both countries face tricky away fixtures			0
until 2006 , @entity1 was regarded as the continent 's sleeping giants , having dominated @entity17 football in the years after it became the first independent @entity56 country over five decades ago			1
by contrast , it took @entity34 -- @entity17 's most populous country -- another three decades to establish itself among the continent 's top national sides			2
it was not until @entity1 's first appearance at the @entity13 in @entity64 in 2006 that the four - times winners of the @entity66 regained some of their lost glory			2
it signaled not only @entity1 's long - awaited arrival at football biggest global gathering but also a fulfillment of a prediction in 1990 by @entity76 legend @entity75 that the world had not seen the best of @entity17 football until the @entity1 made it to the @entity13			1
as continental champions in 1963 , 1965 , 1978 and 1982 and with @entity3 legends including three - times african footballer of the year @entity83 and former @entity84 and @entity86 star @entity85 both rated in their time among the world 's best players , @entity75 knew @entity1 had the qualities to match some of the world 's best			1
youth success at the @entity13 under - 17 championship in 1991 and 1995 , two appearances in the final of the under - 20 championship in 1993 and 2001 and an @entity99 bronze medal in @entity100 in 1992 emphasized @entity1 's abundance of talent and unfulfilled promise at the highest level			1
at @entity64 2006 , @entity1 became the only @entity17 survivor after the preliminary round , surprising the bookmakers with victories over the @entity109 and the @entity110 before losing 3 - 0 to @entity11 in a match that was closer than the scoreline suggested			2
@entity1 's squad for next year 's @entity13 in @entity114 will likely include the cream of the team that impressed in @entity64 , including @entity39 and @entity41 , as well as some of the brilliant youngsters who sparkled this month @entity119 in @entity15 ; notably @entity120 and @entity122 winner @entity121 , @entity123 and @entity124 , the son of @entity83			1
following the side 's masterful display in @entity15 and relatively easy @entity13 qualifying campaign , the @entity1 will carry both @entity3 and @entity17 expectations on their shoulders as they bid to improve on the quarterfinal places achieved by @entity76 and @entity131 in 1990 and 2002 respectively			1
with a population of around 140 million and a reputation for producing stars such as @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity40 's @entity137 , the outstanding qualities of @entity140 football are beyond question			0
but @entity17 football observers believe poor administration by the @entity144 and the resultant instability in the technical direction of the team has undermined the development of @entity140 football and resulted in its dwindling fortunes at the world stage			2
@entity34 emerged as @entity17 's leading side in 1980 by wining the @entity66 , a feat they repeated 14 years later in @entity46			2
the @entity34 made their @entity13 debut in the @entity110 in 1994 and qualified for both @entity154 1998 and @entity156 / @entity155			0
like @entity1 , @entity34 has shown promise at youth level , winning @entity160 titles in 1985 , 1993 and 2007 , and winning @entity99 gold at the @entity162			0
as host of this year 's @entity13 under - 17 championship , @entity34 will be hoping to draw inspiration from @entity1 's performance in @entity15 to retain the title on home soil next month			1
at continental level , the once powerful @entity34 are anything but super			0
since reaching the final of the 2000 @entity66 , @entity34 has failed make any meaningful impact despite parading highly - talented squads			0
for three successive tournaments @entity34 finished in third place before crashing out at the quarterfinal stage of the 2008 edition in a 2 - 1 defeat by @entity1			2
@entity180 , the 39 - year - old president of the @entity181 ( @entity181 ) , believes the country is reaping the dividends of a professional approach through the implementation of a five - year business plan , which has attracted massive injection of cash through corporate sponsorship from kit sponsor @entity190 and mining , banking , brewery and telecommunication firms			0
" when we took over in 2005 we realized that one of the biggest problems we faced was the availability of timelines of funds needed to prepare the teams adequately , provide the necessary incentives for the players and numeration for the technical staff , " @entity180 says			0
" the availability of funding timely and an autonomy for the federation has helped us execute our plans effectively and this is showing in our recent impressive performances			0
" beyond monetary considerations and administrative stability , @entity1 is also reaping the rewards of years of investment in youth football which has produced players like @entity39 and @entity41 -- and now new kid on the block @entity121 and others			1
for now , the country seem to have regained bragging rights as the superpower in @entity17 .			0

@entity1 becomes first @entity17 nation to win football 's under - 20 @entity13
result part of shift in balance of power in @entity17 from @entity34 to @entity1
@entity1 has stars including @entity39 , @entity41 , @entity121
@entity34 has star players but national team struggles with poor *infrastructure*
