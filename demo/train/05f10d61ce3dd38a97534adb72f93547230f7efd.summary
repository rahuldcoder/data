@entity0 , @entity1 -- malaria is preventable and curable , yet every 30 seconds , a child in @entity4 dies from the disease , according to the @entity6			1
the roll back malaria partnership has pledged money for nets , anti-malarial treatments and research for a vaccine			1
last year on april 25 , the @entity14 initiative was launched to raise awareness of the disease and efforts to control malaria around the world , as part of the @entity22 partnership -- a global group of non-governmental organizations ( @entity25 ) and governments			1
the groups behind @entity22 set ambitious goals to ensure universal access to malaria medication and treated mosquito nets in @entity4 by the end of 2010			1
they also announced plans to attain near zero malaria - related deaths by 2015			1
according to the @entity6 , the malaria currently kills one million people every year			2
as the second @entity14 approaches , how successful has the roll back malaria partnership been in its aims ? certainly , in the past two years , rapid progress has been made in malaria control , including a 60 percent decrease in malaria - related deaths in some countries such as @entity45 and @entity46 , according to figures from the @entity6			1
@entity49 is director of the @entity50 , an organization launched to design malaria control programs in developing countries			1
writing in the medical journal @entity54 , he said : " overall , we have many reasons to be optimistic			2
" except for those countries that are politically dysfunctional or suffering major conflicts , the 61 malaria control countries in the heartland will make great progress in reducing death and sickness from malaria over the next 10 years			1
" " the challenge now is the implementation gap between political commitment , ambition , and availability of funds , and the capacity at ground level to do the work that needs to be done			0
" the roll back malaria partnership 's profile has also been raised by the surge of new ngos such as @entity78 , and their partnerships with international celebrities			2
footballer @entity81 and actor @entity82 recently lent their support to the cause			0
earlier this month , @entity82 won a @entity87 race against @entity88 to reach one million followers			0
the actor pledged 10,000 mosquito nets to @entity78 , if he beat @entity88 , and 1,000 if he lost			0
@entity88 agreed to do the same			0
@entity88 's founder @entity92 's @entity91 has also donated $ 2 million to deliver insecticide - treated bed nets to more than 630,000 people in @entity96 refugee camps			0
" since last year , we have achieved enormous progress in many countries by donating money , assistance and monitoring progress , " executive director of @entity22 , professor @entity104 , told @entity88			1
read our malaria a to z guide and last week , the partnership decided on a new plan to subsidize anti-malarial medication in 11 @entity96 countries at first , where one treatment dose now costs $ 10 in the private sector , more than many @entity96 earn in a week			1
" we will negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to make them reduce the price of anti-malarial medication " said @entity104 , a former @entity113 health minister			0
as a result , the price of medication will be expected to drop to at least a tenth of its current price			0
to achieve all its goals , @entity104 says the partnership needs $ 5 billion			0
they have already received $ 2 billion from the @entity127 , the @entity128 -- launched by president @entity129 in 2005 -- and foundations like the @entity131			0
" i think that achieving zero deaths by 2015 is a very ambitious goal , " @entity104 explained , " but i believe at least several countries will be able to achieve it			1
on a global scale , we still need progress			2
" @entity139 , ceo of the @entity140 at the @entity131 , believes the roll back malaria partnership was right to strive for such ambitious targets			2
" we have to strive for these goals " she told @entity88 , " because unless they set these goals , we 're never going to achieve them			0
" now it 's up to us on the ground to make them happen			0

as @entity14 approaches , many are optimistic about ending malaria deaths
in the past two years , rapid progress has been made in malaria control
some countries like @entity46 have *reported* a 60 percent decrease in malaria deaths
