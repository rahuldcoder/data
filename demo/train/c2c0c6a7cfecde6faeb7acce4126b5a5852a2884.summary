all @entity0 did wednesday was change its corporate name , introduce two new smartphones and launch a bold new mobile operating system , @entity0 10 , that may be the struggling company 's last stab at relevance			1
now it 's up to consumers to render a verdict on whether @entity0 's new offerings -- the all - touchscreen @entity11 phone and the @entity12 , which still has a keyboard -- are worth buying over iphones or @entity16 devices			1
@entity0 ( they 're now no longer known as @entity18 ) still has some work to do , and early reviews of @entity0 have been mixed			2
but there are some promising signs out there			0
here are five reasons @entity0 10 may win over fans , new and old			1
new productivity features large companies and government agencies have historically been @entity0 's core clients			1
but in recent years more people have been bringing their own devices into the workplace , choosing to stick with fun , app - laden phones over devices that just offer security and it - department approval			2
for @entity0 , the company smartly focused on features that maximize productivity and speed			1
a new feature called @entity43 splits a @entity0 phone into two separate devices , one for work and one for personal use			2
( @entity43 is only for customers connected to @entity49 at work			0
) the separate profiles cordon off sensitive work information so that it departments can control the flow of data			0
personal apps , e-mails and photos are on the personal side , so you can jump from one profile to the other			0
it 's a way to manage both sides of your life without sacrificing privacy or security , and without dragging around two separate devices as some @entity0 users have been doing			1
@entity70 : @entity0 's @entity11 and @entity0 feel a generation late being productive requires switching between apps and tasks quickly and seamlessly			1
at the @entity0 launch event wednesday morning , executives demonstrated something called @entity77 , which collects all a user 's notifications in one spot			1
it can be accessed from anywhere on the phone with a swipe , and shows social media , calendar , @entity87 , e-mail and other updates ( you can pick what shows up here to minimize noise )			0
you can have up to eight apps going at once , and the feature lets users quickly switch back and forth between messaging platforms without having to open or close apps or revisit the home screen			0
another popular tool , @entity87 ( @entity87 to its friends ) , got a new upgrade			0
the messaging app already allowed for free voice calls over @entity105 , but in @entity0 it 's adding a @entity107 - like video - chatting feature			1
perhaps its coolest new trick is the ability to share your phone 's screen with the person on the other end of the call ( if they 're also on a @entity0 device ) , so you can review work documents or enjoy photos together without having to e-mail or upload the files			1
big - name apps a smartphone is only as good as its app - store selection			0
@entity0 has been working hard , and spending money , to fill up its app store with over 70,000 apps for the launch of @entity0			2
however , many of those apps are old @entity0 or @entity16 apps that have been ported over to the new system , not designed specifically for its features			1
it 's going to require quality , not just quantity , for people to leave behind the @entity138 and @entity140 store			0
@entity0 has managed to secure an impressive number of big - name apps out the gate			2
@entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 and " @entity148 " have committed to developing for @entity0 , which means they 're on the way soon , if not in the online store yet			2
popular apps such as @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 already have @entity0 apps			2
but there are still many missing pieces , such as apps for @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 products			2
@entity0 is clearly aware of the importance of robust app offerings			2
but app developers might still need to be convinced that the new platform will catch on and not be a waste of their time			0
typing is easy to learn @entity0 fans are good at resisting change			1
its diehard users have stuck with the company even though there were more advanced phones running superior software and featuring stores stocked with many more apps			2
the biggest sticking point was the beloved physical keyboard that could be navigated with a lone speedy thumb			0
although @entity0 announced two devices on monday , it was the keyboard - free @entity11 phone that dominated the event and is getting the larger marketing push			2
the company clearly wants to shift users to a touchscreen keyboard			0
to be successful , it will have to make learning how to type on the screen simple and enjoyable			0
" typing on a glass screen with one thumb , it 's magic , " said @entity192			0
in @entity0 's future , keyboards may be an afterthought @entity0 says the touchscreen keyboard learns how you type , adapting over time to be more accurate and to automatically correct common mistakes			1
there 's support for multiple languages , and you can switch between languages mid-message			0
while you are typing , it will auto - suggest what words it thinks you may be composing , and you can swipe up to toss one directly into your message			0
positive buzz a strange thing has happened in the past couple of months			0
consumers , investors and the press have been cautiously optimistic about the @entity217 company 's plans for a comeback			1
@entity0 has gone from being mocked to being seen as an underdog people are rooting for			2
rebranding is one part of that process , and on monday ceo @entity192 announced that the company is renaming itself @entity0 , dropping the awkward @entity18 ( @entity18 ) moniker			1
@entity0 has n't had a major product release in 18 months , which is an eternity in the smartphone world and long enough for memories of the devices to slip people 's minds			1
hardcore fans may be ready to upgrade to @entity0 , but to take on @entity233 and @entity164 , @entity0 needs to shed its stigma of being out of date			1
when you want cool points , you hire a celebrity ( see : @entity239 and @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 )			0
@entity0 trotted out @entity243 near the end of wednesday 's event and gave her the honorary title of @entity248			1
it was a nice touch , but tech - savvy shoppers are n't easily fooled by celebrity endorsements			0
they need to see real people using the devices , and they need to test them out for themselves			0
global appeal @entity0 is rolling out its new @entity11 phone gradually around the world , starting in the @entity258 on thursday			1
the phone launches in @entity217 on february 5 , and in the @entity260 on february 10			0
it wo n't be released in the @entity261 until sometime in march			0
the focus on making the phone an international product is smart , since the company has a strong hold in places like the @entity260 , @entity268 , @entity269 and parts of @entity271			0
wednesday 's press announcement referenced satellite launch events for @entity0 fans in @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 , among other far - flung places			1
@entity0 has n't just been wooing developers in the @entity261 , it 's paying attention to the top mobile apps in other markets and getting those developers to create products for the @entity0 platform			1
to hold its own against @entity233 , @entity16 and @entity286 , it will need them .			1
