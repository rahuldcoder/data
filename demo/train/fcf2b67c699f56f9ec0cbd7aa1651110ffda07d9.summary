-- the prominent man had an altercation with his wife at a hotel			2
there 's even a recording of it			2
and what happened ? a plea deal so generous that the abuser 's arrest record will be expunged -- totally clean , as if the whole thing had never happened -- if he receives some counseling in the next few months			1
but @entity16 's case is strikingly similar to that of @entity19 , a sitting federal judge in @entity20			1
on august 9 , @entity19 's wife called 911 from a hotel room in @entity23 , according to news reports			1
the woman identified as @entity26 said her drunk husband was assaulting her			0
" he 's beating on me			1
please help me , " she said			0
about a minute into the call , as dispatchers summon help , @entity26 is heard saying " i hate you , i hate you			0
" a male voice responds : " i hate you too , " followed by dull noises in the background			0
according to police , @entity26 had cuts to her mouth and forehead and she told them her husband had thrown her to the ground , pulled her hair and kicked her after she confronted him over an alleged affair with a law clerk			0
last week , the whole matter was swept discreetly under the rug			0
@entity19 accepted " pretrial diversion " offered by @entity23 prosecutors			1
under the deal , the judge has to have a drug and alcohol evaluation -- which , according to his lawyer , he does n't need			2
" he does n't have a drug or alcohol problem and never has , " @entity55 , @entity19 's attorney , told al.com			1
then , @entity19 will have to undergo a once - a - week family and domestic violence program for 24 weeks			1
the judge can undergo that counseling at a location close to home in @entity20			1
what happens after @entity19 completes counseling ? he plans to return to the bench , to pass judgment on others			1
as @entity19 put it , " i also look forward to ... returning to full , active status in the @entity70 of @entity20			1
" ( his cases have been temporarily reassigned			0
taxpayers are paying him his full salary in the meantime			0
) the parallels between the @entity16 and @entity19 cases extend further			1
in both cases , the couples stayed together			2
after @entity16 beat his then - fiancee , @entity80 , unconscious in @entity81 , @entity82 , the couple married			1
@entity84 attended the july meeting with @entity87 commissioner @entity86 that led to his appallingly lenient two - game suspension from the @entity89			0
@entity87 toughens domestic violence policy with six - game bans after @entity92 released the video of the elevator assault , @entity84 released a statement of support for her husband , on @entity98			0
" to take something away from the man i love that he has worked for all his life just to gain ratings is horrific , " she wrote , " if your intentions were to hurt us , embarrass us , make us feel alone , take our happiness away , you 've succeeded on so many levels			0
just know we will continue to grow & show the world what love is			0
" @entity19 is also attempting , apparently successfully , to repair the breach with his wife			1
" this incident has been very embarrassing to me , my family , friends and the court , " he said in his statement , " i deeply regret this incident and look forward to working to resolve these difficulties with my family , where they should be resolved			2
" consider that last line : " my family , where they should be resolved			2
" this is precisely wrong , and it contributes to a fundamental misunderstanding about domestic violence			0
when husbands beat up their wives , that is not a matter that should be resolved within the family			2
it is a crime to be resolved by the legal system			1
in cases of domestic violence , the question is often raised whether the victim will " press charges			2
" but it 's not victims who press charges in this country , it 's the state			2
@entity16 video prompts stories of # @entity148 , # whyileft it 's not up to victims to decide whether their husbands should be prosecuted			1
abusers damage the community , not just the women they assault			0
whether the @entity156 and @entity157 stay married is their business ; but whether @entity16 and judge @entity19 committed crimes should be a question for prosecutors , and ultimately , juries to decide			1
unfortunately , it looks like the prosecutors failed in @entity81 and @entity23			0
the sweet deals for these two prominent defendants can not be undone ; the double jeopardy clause of the @entity167 forbids it			0
all the rest of us can do is hope that the next prominent man who beats up his wife does n't get off as easy .			0

@entity175 : @entity16 case *mirrors* @entity20 judge 's case ; both got plea deals
he says audio of judge @entity19 *documents* beating ; cops say wife had injuries
@entity19 said issue should be resolved within family . @entity175 : he 's *mistaken*
@entity175 : it 's not up to couples to decide charges , it 's a crime for legal system
