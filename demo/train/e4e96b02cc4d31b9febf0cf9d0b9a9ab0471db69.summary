-- @entity2 golfer @entity1 captured his first @entity5 @entity4 title in four years on monday , earning himself a place in @entity8 's team for next month 's @entity9			1
he overcame a rain delay which put a halt to sunday 's play to win the @entity13 , beating @entity15 @entity14 by two strokes in @entity17 , @entity18			1
a victory was essential to push the 32 - year - old into the top - 10 ranked @entity8 players who automatically qualify for the team to face the @entity5			1
he now stands in sixth place and can not be pushed out of those spots			0
@entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 were already in the team to travel to @entity34 at the end of september			1
@entity8 team captain @entity36 also has two wildcard picks for the tournament , with @entity39 expected to take one of those places			1
" we 'll see when the team comes out , but i think my chances are a little better now , " @entity1 said			1
@entity1 was one of 38 players who had to return to the course to complete their final round on monday			1
he had a less than solid restart when a bogey dropped him into a tie with @entity14 , who was cheered on by a partisan local crowd who supported him because he once attended the local university			2
but @entity1 came back in style			2
he birdied four holes out of five to put some space between him and the field			0
at the 13th hole it looked like he was on course for the victory			0
a chip to within a foot of the hole left him an easy put for another birdie			0
an impressive bunker shot got him out of trouble and kept him on track for the win at the 15th			0
not even a bogey on the 18th could spoil the celebrations , even though it meant he had slipped a shot to card a final - round 66 for an 18 - under - par total of 262			2
@entity14 finished one shot clear of @entity77 in third , while there was a three - way tie for fourth between @entity5 @entity80 and @entity81 and @entity83 's @entity82 on 14 under			1
@entity1 's victory was his first on @entity5 soil since he won the @entity86 , and eighth overall			1
it also helped bury some ghosts of his previous visit to the @entity13 in 2009 , when he held a share of the third - round lead but eventually finished fourth			1
it doubled his prize money this season on the @entity4 to $ 1.8 million from 13 starts , and lifted him up 69 places to 33rd in the @entity99 standings ahead of this week 's opening playoff event , the @entity101			0
@entity14 also continued his climb , up to 54th from 109			2
the top 30 players qualify for the @entity105 finale			0
@entity106 finished the regular season second behind @entity108 after his seventh - placing at @entity17 , with @entity110 winner @entity25 third			0
@entity1 used a local caddy after parting with his usual bagman after this month 's @entity110 , where he missed the cut			1
" caddies are great , but sometimes i feel like i depend too much on them , " @entity1 said			2
" instead of making a decision myself , i would wait for the caddy to make a decision for me and then maybe i do n't feel comfortable with that and still try to do it			0
" i wanted to start making decisions for myself , right and wrong			0
not all my decisions were good this week			0
but at least i was pretty much 100 % committed to most of my decisions , and that was nice to see			0
