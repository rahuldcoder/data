-- @entity1 is a thing of the past , but a number of companies are racing to release the first supersonic business jet			1
@entity6 is working on a jet that would reach @entity8 1.6 and would possibly be ready for release by 2020 , while @entity10 has announced plans for the @entity12 , a business jet that could travel at speeds of @entity14 and would be available by 2018			1
so why has it taken nearly 50 years to revisit the concept ? according to @entity17 , president and ceo of @entity10 , one of the main issues that plagued the @entity1 was the sonic boom -- the disruptive noise that results from the shockwaves created when an object travels faster than the speed of sound			1
" at its worst , the sonic boom would sound like a loud thunder clap over your head			1
it would rattle windows and loosen roof tiles			2
if you lived under the @entity1 's flight path , you might hear it several times a day , " he says			2
the effect was so disturbing that most countries either banned supersonic flights , or restricted them from traveling over land			2
understandably , this is an issue that the aerospace industry has needed to address in order to make supersonic flight viable			1
a plane without windows ? @entity17 notes that currently , it makes more sense to develop supersonic business jets than larger commercial aircraft , because the plane 's diminutive size results in a smaller boom			1
while he 's remained tight - lipped about many aspects of the design ( some are still awaiting patent ) , he recently announced that the @entity12 will be built without windows ( except for the one the pilots see out of ) , a feature that will reduce drag and overall cost of the unit			1
" even at subsonic speeds , windows add a tremendous cost to the aircraft because the fuselage has to be designed to support those windows			2
if you eliminate all that , you create piece with less structural issues , less manufacturing costs , and less parts count , " he says			0
it sounds like a claustrophobe 's nightmare , though @entity17 has attempted to compensate for the windowless design by installing flatscreens , which can either display the view outside , or can be used to show a movie or powerpoint presentation -- should a conference need to take place in the air			2
" it 's not a new concept , but in the past we did n't have the technology -- the flatscreens , or digital cameras to capture the resolution , or the ability to stitch together cameras to create a seamless panoramic view , " he says			2
overall , the saving in manufacturing means each unit will cost between $ 60 million to $ 80 million			0
it 's all in the wing according to @entity6 , the main detriment to producing a supersonic aircraft in the near future is n't the boom ( an issue even @entity17 admits is still another 15 years or so from being fully resolved ) , but the cost			1
" the reasons speeds have n't changed much since the 1960s has more to do with economics than technology			0
you just ca n't have supersonic travel at the rock - bottom fares most passengers prefer " says @entity113 , the director of communications for @entity6			0
" those constraints do n't apply to business jets , so it 's most likely supersonic technology will be applied there first			1
even so , economy of operation is important , mainly in terms of fuel efficiency			0
if you ca n't find a way to reduce fuel consumption , you wo n't have a supersonic jet that will get you very far , " he adds			0
when the @entity1 slowed down to below @entity133 , it burned though more fuel			0
@entity6 has been researching ways to compensate this with the development of the supersonic natural laminar flow ( @entity139 ) wing , which it has been testing in conjunction with @entity142			0
the wing , which is thinner and shorter than typical plane wings , has been proven to reduce friction drag by 80 % , and overall airframe drag by 20 %			0
" the more drag , the more power required to push a wing through the air , " explains @entity113			0
a resolution ? while work is being done on the sonic boom issue , neither @entity6 nor @entity10 expect to release a jet before it 's resolved completely			1
the early models will likely only be able to reach high speeds when traveling over seas			0
" we do n't have the sonic boom issue resolved yet , " admits @entity17 , " you would n't be able to fly above @entity133 between @entity161 and @entity162 , for instance			1
but between @entity164 and @entity162 ? you 'd see a big time savings			0

a few companies are developing supersonic business jets
@entity10 has a model that will be built without windows , but will instead have flatscreens lining the cabin
the biggest *challenges* to supersonic flight is cost and *mitigating* sonic boom
