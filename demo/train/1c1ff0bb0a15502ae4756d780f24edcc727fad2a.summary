-- a woman who says she twice worked for @entity3 co-owner @entity2 sued him this week , alleging that he sexually harassed her and made her uncomfortable with racist remarks -- and that he once fired her after she objected			1
@entity6 's lawsuit , filed monday in @entity7 , alleges she and @entity2 were in a romantic relationship from 2005 to 2011 , and that she " worked for him and his foundation " before her irritation at what she claims were his racially offensive remarks split them apart			1
@entity6 alleges @entity2 made racist comments about her former husband , who is black , and about the couple 's children			1
" why would you bring black people into the world ? " @entity2 allegedly said , according to the lawsuit			1
the suit also alleges @entity2 said : " i want to take you out of the black world and put you into the white world			1
" referring to @entity6 's former relationship , @entity2 would tell her , " you ran away with a black boy , " including once at a table full of people at a restaurant , according to the lawsuit			1
in addition , the lawsuit quotes @entity2 as allegedly telling @entity6 that she had " moved to the ghetto " and that " black people do not take care of their children			1
all they do is sit at home and smoke dope			0
" an attorney for @entity2 , @entity42 , told @entity0 that @entity6 's claim was " baseless and ridiculous			1
" " she was never employed by @entity2 , " he said			2
" her claim was obviously prompted by opportunistic motives			0
" @entity46 , @entity6 's attorney , told @entity0 tuesday that her client has " quite a bit of evidence			2
" @entity46 said @entity6 returned to work for @entity2 after having a " problematic relationship " with him because she knew his girlfriend was @entity55 , the woman who released his now - infamous audio recording			1
" she knew @entity55 was his girlfriend and she felt then she would n't have to have sex with him and she came back into his employ as his caretaker , " @entity46 said			0
the lawsuit claims that after @entity6 re-established contact with @entity2 in late 2013 , he hired her as his " personal assistant / caretaker " with an agreement to pay her $ 10,000 a month			1
however , the suit says , he " dangled money only if she would have sex with him , " and she " refused to perform many of the acts			1
" " she was introduced as his caretaker			0
and she was promised wages and she was not paid those wages			0
so she is entitled to be paid for her work , and that 's what this lawsuit is all about , " @entity46 said			0
@entity2 fired her after she protested against the alleged sexual harassment and racist remarks he allegedly made , the suit says			1
the lawsuit said @entity6 was at @entity2 's home one day when he was on the phone with former @entity87 star @entity86 and she heard him make " derogatory comments of a sexual and racial nature " about @entity86			1
@entity2 's public troubles began in april when @entity91 posted a recording in which he was heard making racist comments			2
@entity2 's inflammatory remarks to @entity55 spawned outrage among @entity87 fans , players and executives			2
chief among the latter was @entity87 commissioner @entity101 , who banned @entity2 from the league , fined him $ 2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise			2
@entity2 , an attorney and billionaire real estate mogul , is now fighting to keep his co-ownership of the @entity87 franchise			2
in the recording , @entity2 argues with @entity55 about how she posted a photo of herself with @entity86 to @entity111			0
" in your lousy f * * ing @entity113 , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , " @entity2 says			0
" if it 's white people , it 's ok ? " the woman responds			0
" if it was @entity122 , would it make a difference ? " @entity122 was also an @entity87 star who played with the @entity124 and a storied rival of @entity86 , who played for the @entity126			0
@entity2 's camp , in turn , has filed a lawsuit , claiming that the @entity87 move to terminate his ownership " is unconstitutional , in breach of contract , in restraint of trade , in breach of fiduciary duties and ... is malicious and oppressive			2
" the lawsuit seeks more than $ 1 billion from the @entity87 for its decision to ban him for life and force him to sell the franchise			0
it comes amid fresh questions about the 80 - year - old 's mental state , raising the issue of how much control he has or should have with the @entity146			0
@entity2 's estranged wife , @entity147 , last week agreed to sell the @entity3 to former @entity149 ceo @entity148 for $ 2 billion			0
