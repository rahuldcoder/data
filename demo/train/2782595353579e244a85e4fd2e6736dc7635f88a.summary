@entity0 , @entity1 -- monitoring the immigration crisis requires keeping one eye on @entity5 and one on the @entity9 - @entity8 border			1
one place is full of corrupt and mercenary characters who protect their interests , do n't follow the rules , play with people 's lives and who only care about making money and amassing power and ensuring their own survival			2
then you have the border			2
alarmed over tens of thousands of child refugees coming into the @entity9 , @entity24 @entity23 last week sent up a flare -- and wound up setting themselves on fire			1
with the @entity29 in recess until after @entity28 , @entity23 approved a pair of show bills			1
the first bill -- a $ 694 million emergency spending measure to deal with the border crisis and approved by a 223 - 189 vote -- showed that @entity24 speaker @entity37 could muster just enough support to overcome meddling by outsiders			1
sens. @entity41 of @entity42 and @entity43 of @entity44 lobbied to defeat the measure because they wanted to preserve the narrative that president @entity48 is solely to blame for the fact that at least 57,000 unaccompanied minors from @entity51 have streamed across the @entity9 - @entity8 border since october 2013			2
they wanted to punish @entity48 by denying resources to house and care for the children			2
the second bill showed @entity59 immigrants how much contempt the @entity23 has for them			1
by a vote of 216 - 192 , @entity24 republicans and four @entity63 -- reps			1
@entity65 of @entity66 , @entity67 from @entity68 , @entity69 of @entity70 and @entity71 of @entity72 -- voted out of spite to end the administration 's policy offering @entity76			0
for @entity23 , it was a chance to use the border crisis to attack a dispensation they never liked which offers more than half a million undocumented young people a two - year reprieve from deportation			1
the bill will never become law , but the damage is done -- to the @entity23			1
as if @entity89 did n't have enough reasons to hate the @entity23 , the attack on the @entity88 gives them a fresh batch			1
ironically , in 2016 , that could benefit @entity93 , who has decided that on the issue of the refugee children she is pro-choice			0
unfortunately , it is multiple choice			0
in june , @entity98 said in a @entity2 interview that the border kids " should be sent back			2
" then , in july , during an interview on fusion -- the liberal cable network co-owned by @entity104 and @entity105 and aimed at @entity106 - speaking @entity89 -- @entity98 claimed that she was talking about " migrant children " not " refugee children			0
" someone please tell her that @entity89 are fond of both			0
if children do n't have a claim to asylum or family members in the @entity9 , @entity98 told @entity116 , they should be returned			0
never mind that the kids would be going back into darkness			0
@entity63 call this a humanitarian crisis			1
how do you humanely hand a death sentence to an 8 - year - old ? " we send kids back all the time , " @entity98 said coldly			0
and to think , this woman began her career protecting children in @entity51			0
now that she 's a politician , she thinks it 's her job to protect @entity51 from children			0
still , @entity98 insisted , the @entity9 could help set up a screening process in countries like @entity133 , @entity134 , and @entity135 to determine whether children qualify for asylum			2
in her clumsiness on immigration , @entity98 takes after @entity48 , whose handling of the issue -- in a recent poll from @entity143 - @entity142 -- earned the disapproval of 68 % of @entity9			2
only 31 % approve of the job he 's doing			0
that 's what happens when you ca n't decide whether you want to be tough or compassionate			0
@entity98 , @entity48 and other democrats have secret weapons			0
in this go - around , the @entity63 played the opposition masterfully			1
@entity48 made an initial misstep , saying what @entity98 said -- that the kids had to go home -- and setting in motion plans for their expedited removal , without due process			0
then he got smart and returned to the @entity63 script of doing nothing and watching the @entity23 implode			1
in the new narrative , @entity48 and other @entity63 were actually seen by many @entity89 as the good guys , fighting the good fight against those evil republicans who wanted to send the kids back home			1
to think @entity23 swallowed the line about how @entity48 was going to take executive action to loosen immigration laws			1
would this be the same @entity48 who spent the last five and a half years fighting with immigration activists and insisting he did n't have this power ? he never wanted to use it before			2
why use it now ? democrats set a clever trap , and @entity23 walked into it			1
the @entity23 will pay for that mistake for years , and deservedly so			1
the rest of us learned a lesson			0
the next time we face a crisis where desperate people fleeing violence and oppression look to us for help , the most we can hope for is that @entity187 do what 's best for all concerned -- and stay out of it .			0

@entity24 votes for spending bill on border crisis and against reprieve program for " *dreamers* "
@entity197 : @entity63 set a clever trap on immigration and @entity23 fell into it
he says republicans *alienate* @entity59 voters by showing contempt for issues they care about
