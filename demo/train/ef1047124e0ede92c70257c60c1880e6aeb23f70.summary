-- the popular uprising in @entity2 against the @entity4 - led minority regime of @entity5 poses a serious challenge to @entity8 national security in the @entity9			1
as it fights for its survival amid escalating violence , the @entity2 regime risks not only the deepening of civil strife in the country , but also provoking sectarian strife in the region , potentially drawing in @entity8 military involvement			1
@entity19 has thus far been cautious in dealing with @entity2 , favoring strong words and sanctions against the regime and supporting @entity24 efforts to stop the violent military crackdown			1
but this could change as conditions in @entity2 deteriorate			2
the recent arrival in @entity2 of @entity24 observers , as part of a @entity2 - endorsed @entity32 plan to stop the violence , has been met with mixed emotions			1
@entity2 opposition members rejected the plan , which was mediated by @entity37 , on the grounds that it will give the bestial regime another chance to continue its brutal policies			2
@entity2 pipeline attached amid ongoing killing @entity44 , the head of the @entity46 opposition movement , emphasized that the observers can not do their work because " they can not go where the authorities do n't want them to go			2
" the @entity32 's initiative is further tainted by the contemptible presence of @entity55 gen. @entity54 , who heads the mission			0
@entity57 held high military intelligence and security positions in the government of president @entity61 , who is wanted on international charges of genocide in @entity64			0
meanwhile , @entity2 continues its slow , steady descent into sectarian strife			1
there is the militarization of segments of the opposition , as manifested by the creation of the @entity72 , and the targeted sectarian murders committed in mixed towns , especially in @entity75			0
indeed , the recent twin suicide bombings in @entity77 , regardless of the identity of the as - yet - unknown culprits , could well be a portent of what may happen in the multireligious , multiethnic country			0
this premonition of escalating violence is shared by many in the region , including those within the ranks of the @entity2 opposition			2
@entity2 is tightly linked both to the evolving @entity24 politics -- as influenced by the past year 's @entity24 popular uprisings -- and to the ongoing shifts in the @entity94 and @entity96 - led regional axes of powers that have resulted from withdrawal of @entity8 troops from @entity37			1
to be sure , it is the @entity32 mission that reflects more the deep divisions splintering the @entity24 world : the @entity32 , led by @entity94 and @entity103 , initially determined to pressure the autocratic @entity2 regime into submission , but this resolve was weakened by @entity37 questioning the @entity32 's apparent double - standard policy			1
its stance on @entity2 contrasts sharply with its position on @entity110			0
@entity94 , along with other @entity112 countries , sent troops to @entity110 to help quash a @entity116 majority - dominated uprising against that kingdom 's @entity118 monarchy			2
similarly , the government of @entity37 prime minister @entity121 , acting apparently in concert with @entity96 , has not concealed its desire to keep the @entity2 regime in power			1
@entity96 has described the violence in @entity2 as part of a @entity130 - @entity129 conspiracy against the regime			1
and @entity133 forces in @entity37 and @entity134 , such as the @entity135 and @entity136 respectively , have expressed their readiness to support the @entity2 regime			0
beyond this , the withdrawal of @entity8 troops from @entity37 has apparently boosted the confidence not only of @entity96 and its proxies but also the @entity2 regime			1
@entity96 and @entity136 laud the " resistance " for forcing the @entity8 from @entity37 , and @entity2 no longer fears an @entity8 interference from @entity37			1
in fact , the regime believes that @entity37 now affords @entity2 another strategic buffer with regard to a potential @entity150 military intervention ; the other being offered by @entity134			0
this will undoubtedly leave the international community facing neither an @entity24 nor a @entity155 solution			0
@entity155 recently introduced a draft resolution the @entity157 on ending the violence in @entity2			0
however , @entity155 , along with @entity158 , has had serious disagreements with other members of the @entity157 , who favor sanctions against @entity77 , including an arms embargo			0
@entity19 will most likely confront urgent @entity24 and @entity2 opposition requests for direct involvement in @entity2			1
already , @entity44 has called on the @entity157 to adopt the @entity24 initiative ; at the same time some @entity24 and @entity2 opposition leaders have vocally called for a no - fly zone and @entity169 involvement to protect civilians			1
but a word of caution			0
the danger of this kind of involvement lies in the grave and complex reality that @entity96 still considers the security of the @entity2 regime as part of its own security , and that , while both @entity182 and @entity77 have been preparing for a conflict with @entity8 since its invasion of @entity37 in 2003 , including supporting proxy forces in the region , @entity19 has thus far pursued policies more reactive in nature to regional developments			1
@entity19 should be careful about falling into the duplicitous trap of @entity9 politics			0
@entity19 must act within the context that @entity2 is already in the throes of civil strife , which can only intensify and possibly spill over into @entity134 or @entity37 , and that the @entity24 states are fighting two wars			1
one is over the nature of future power in their capitals and the other is over which regional axis they will support			0
@entity19 should also disabuse itself of the notion that the terminally ill @entity2 regime will collapse soon			0
the regime has life support from @entity96 , @entity37 and @entity134 , and thrives on terror and @entity24 schisms			2
this makes any reactive or reflexive @entity8 involvement in @entity2 fraught with uncertainties and serious risks			2
@entity19 's policies should focus now on expanding and organizing its cooperation with @entity215 , @entity94 and @entity103 , which have deep interest in a change of power in @entity77 ; supporting the @entity72 through @entity94 and @entity215 ; strengthening sanctions against @entity2 in concert with regional and international allies , including placing sanctions on @entity118 merchants closely associated with the regime			1
; maintaining and supporting a strong diplomatic presence in @entity37 and @entity134 ; seeking out @entity4 and @entity227 political and military figures with the objective of reassuring them with the promise of political inclusion in the future of @entity2			0
most importantly , @entity19 should not lead a campaign in @entity2 designed in the imperial corridors of the @entity8 capital itself			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			0

@entity240 says the popular uprising in @entity2 poses issues for @entity8 *foreign* policy
he says multiethnic nation headed for sectarian strife ; some opposition militarizing
he says @entity2 linked to shifts in both @entity24 politics and @entity94 and @entity96 - led axes of power
@entity238 : @entity8 must use caution , focus on ties with regional allies , strengthening sanctions
