-- it has all the trappings of a proper murder mystery : an attractive , up - and - coming victim , a sudden death , a mysterious stranger , whispers of poison			1
only this case involves a dog , the highly competitive canine show circuit and a professionally adorable samoyed named @entity12 -- @entity13 for short			1
the 3 - year - old dog fell ill and died on february 16 in @entity15 , @entity16 , barely a week after he appeared -- but did n't place -- in the prestigious @entity18 dog show			1
" i think somebody deliberately poisoned this dog , " @entity13 's handler , @entity19 , told @entity0 on friday			1
but , as with any good mystery , it 's not that cut and dried			0
the profuse bleeding that killed @entity13 can be caused by a number of conditions , according to the veterinarian who examined @entity13 , @entity29			1
after @entity19 rushed the dog to the vet when he threw up blood , @entity13 owner @entity30 says , @entity29 listed rat poison as a possible cause			1
but because @entity19 and @entity36 declined a necropsy or further testing , the final answer wo n't ever be known , @entity29 said in a statement			2
@entity36 says @entity29 told her a necropsy would n't have shown anything if the dog had been poisoned days before			1
the few she 's allowed before all turned up inconclusive , she said			0
" also , the thought at the time of him being cut open was too much for me , " @entity30 said			0
@entity18 dismissed the poisoning suggestion , saying no other dogs fell ill at the show			2
" we have never , to our knowledge , had an incident at our show where a dog has become ill or was harmed as a result of being poisoned , " the group said in a statement this week			1
but the sudden death of an otherwise healthy , closely watched dog seems to point toward poisoning , @entity19 and @entity36 say			1
@entity19 says he watched @entity13 closely to make sure he did n't get into anything dangerous			1
the trip to @entity63 was uneventful			0
he and @entity13 dined on steak from a @entity66 restaurant the night before the show			1
he scoured their hotel room for no - nos. and they traveled together to @entity16 , where he was appearing in the @entity72 dog show			2
the only unusual thing happened during the @entity18 show , when a " scowling " woman emerged from the crowd and accused him of being " cruel " and a " horrible person			2
" the @entity18 show has been " plagued by activists " upset with the dog show circuit , @entity19 said			2
among other things , people have been upset about a procedure called bark reduction , in which a dog 's vocal cords are modified to make it quieter			0
@entity13 had the procedure , @entity19 said			2
but he would n't go so far as to implicate activists -- or the mysterious , angry stranger -- in @entity13 's death			1
" i do n't know who it was			0
i think it was done by someone who was sick , " he said			0
it certainly was n't us , said @entity97 , senior vice president of communications for @entity98			0
" it 's absolutely outrageous			0
the people who should be charged with cruelty to animals in this case are the owners for having cut the vocal cords of this poor dog because they did n't want to hear him bark , " she said			2
" and unfortunately , this is not unique to these people			0
in the really creepy world of dog shows , animals are having their vocal cords cut , their ears cut , their tails are cut off , to make them look a certain way so that their owners can become famous or make money			1
and it 's just sick and it 's perverse , and of course it 's cruel			0
" with so much uncertainty , @entity36 says , the mystery will probably never be solved			0
whatever happened to @entity13 , @entity19 and @entity36 are mourning the loss of the fluffy white dog , who was named best in breed at recent shows in @entity132 and @entity133 , and won best in show at contests in @entity136 this year and @entity132 and @entity137 last year , according to the website doggiestats.com			1
" i just ca n't seem to stop crying and can hardly see , " @entity30 wrote on her @entity140 page			0
@entity0 's @entity141 contributed to this report .			0
