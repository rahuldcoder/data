-- while @entity2 showed more evidence of his importance to @entity5 on saturday , @entity1 responded with an ominous warning of the club 's powers even without @entity9			1
with the four - time world player of the year battling to be fit for wednesday 's visit by the @entity14 league leaders , having injured his hamstring in last week 's 2 - 2 draw , @entity10 put up his hand for a role in the second leg of the @entity21 quarterfinal			1
in a @entity25 performance , the @entity23 midfielder took his chance to impress as he scored his first hat - trick for @entity1 in a 5 - 0 thrashing of @entity29 that kept the @entity31 side 13 points clear of second - placed @entity33 in @entity34			1
@entity35 , another midfielder who has struggled to consistently impress since his 2011 arrival at the @entity37 , chimed in with the other two goals			0
the match was also notable for the second - half introduction of @entity14 defender @entity41 , making his first senior appearance since his liver transplant last april			1
by that stage @entity45 's side , much - changed from the trip to @entity47 , were already five goals ahead as both @entity10 and @entity35 netted twice in the opening period , toying with the visiting defense			1
@entity10 was taken off as a precaution after completing his treble with an assist from @entity55 , but @entity35 hobbled off late with an injury that casts doubt on his fitness for the @entity5 clash			2
@entity1 hope to have @entity9 back for that match , as his injury is not as bad as feared			2
the @entity62 netted the opening goal of the first leg , his 57th this season , but it was @entity2 who had the last word as he set up a late equalizer			0
the @entity71 forward , who was able to play -- and also score -- last week after having his @entity74 suspension halved , has now netted 26 league goals this season following another opportunistic effort in saturday 's 2 - 0 win at @entity79			1
@entity2 finished off from close range in time added on after halftime substitute @entity82 chipped the keeper , denying the veteran @entity85 his first goal since signing in january			0
@entity87 had earlier scored a fine individual goal as @entity89 - funded @entity5 moved seven points clear at the top of the table after the club 's first win at @entity79 since 2002			0
@entity33 , meanwhile , came from behind to crush @entity95 5 - 1 as @entity96 scored two late goals after fellow substitute @entity98 also netted -- his 29th in the league , second best behind @entity9 's 43			1
striker @entity100 volleyed a spectacular equalizer while @entity102 put real 2 - 1 ahead at the break with a penalty			0
it continued @entity33 's form from last week 's 3 - 0 @entity21 win over @entity108 , ahead of tuesday 's trip to @entity110			1
the @entity112 side went seven points clear in the @entity114 on saturday with a 3 - 1 win at home to @entity117 , as veteran striker @entity118 scored twice			0
@entity119 consolidated fourth place in @entity23 with a 4 - 2 win against @entity122 which established a four - point lead over the visitors with eight games to play			0
it dented any hopes @entity122 have of playing in next season 's @entity21 -- if the club 's appeal against a suspension for financial fair play discrepancies is successful -- and placed even more importance on tuesday 's second leg of the quarterfinal tie away to @entity137 side @entity136 , which is level at 0 - 0			2
@entity139 bounced back from last week 's @entity21 defeat against @entity141 by moving 12 points clear in @entity144 's @entity143 with a 2 - 1 win over bottom club @entity146 on saturday			0
@entity148 striker @entity147 scored two late goals before a long - range effort from @entity151 ensured a tense finish			2
second - placed @entity154 host @entity155 on sunday , when third - placed @entity157 travel to @entity158 .			0

@entity10 scores his first hat - trick for @entity1 in *absence* of injured @entity9
@entity35 scores other two goals in @entity166 leaders ' 5 - 0 win over @entity29
@entity168 makes his long - *awaited* return for @entity1 after liver transplant
@entity21 *opponents* @entity5 extend @entity14 lead with win
