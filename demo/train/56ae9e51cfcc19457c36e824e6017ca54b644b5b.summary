@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity3 was fighting to keep his @entity5 seat in @entity6 two years ago , he was forced to keep his distance from a former colleague who also happened to be his party 's top gun at the time , @entity11			1
now , @entity3 is battling for the @entity5 again			1
this time , his arms are wide open for @entity11			1
the 2012 @entity14 presidential nominee campaigned for @entity3 on wednesday for the second time this year , returning to a venue in @entity0 where @entity11 held his own event more than two years ago			1
" this is the guy who ought to be the next @entity22 senator , and you 're going to make him the next @entity22 senator , " @entity11 told the audience wednesday			1
so , why is more @entity3 more comfortable pairing up with @entity11 this time around ? what changed ? the state			1
in 2012 , @entity3 was trying to fend off an aggressive challenge by a progressive favorite in a reliably blue state			1
he cast himself as an independent and was more likely to tout his work with president @entity36 than his relationship with @entity11			2
when he was asked about @entity11 , he would sometimes give a short answer , then change the subject			2
" bringing in a @entity14 like @entity11 to talk about you is not what you want to do when you 're running as a perceived independent in @entity6 , " said @entity40 , director of the @entity42 @entity41			2
now @entity3 is mounting his own challenge , trying to take down incumbent @entity48 sen. @entity47 in neighboring @entity1 , a more politically mixed state			2
@entity11 , who 's perhaps more popular than ever at the moment , is practically an adopted son of @entity1			1
he has a vacation home here and won the 2012 @entity14 primary by a wide margin			0
and campaigning in a state where he 's not " carrying the baggage " as a former governor -- as is the case in @entity6 -- can help make things less complicated , @entity40 said			2
so , strategically , it 's common sense that @entity3 would welcome @entity11 in this state , in this year			1
@entity63 , a @entity14 strategist who led @entity11 's @entity1 campaign , said " it 's natural " for the two men to want to " link arms " this cycle			1
@entity11 's " campaigned here , he 's fought hard , " @entity63 said			1
" i think since the 2012 election , what we 've seen is a real appreciation among the electorate on issues @entity75 campaigned on			0
" with no clear potential frontrunner in the 2016 @entity14 presidential race , calls have surged for @entity11 to make a third @entity80 bid			2
he insists he 's not running , but he has n't entirely ruled it out			0
his wife , @entity82 , told the @entity83 tuesday that it 's a " no " for her husband " at this moment			0
" on stage wednesday , @entity3 echoed sentiments that are fueling renewed interest in @entity11			1
" he was right on @entity89			0
he was right on @entity90			0
he was right on the economy , " @entity3 said			2
" i can tell you , governor , if you were in the @entity80 , the country and the world would seem a whole heck of a lot different			0
" for @entity3 and @entity11 , their political past go back more than a decade			1
when @entity3 was running for the @entity5 in @entity6 in 2004 , @entity11 , who was governor at the time , helped @entity3 raise big money			1
and during @entity3 's 2010 @entity5 race , @entity11 showed support			1
the two northeast republicans are also known to share advisers			0
but is it awkward for them to pair up now after keeping their distance two years ago ? " i do n't think there would be any awkwardness -- they 're pros , " said @entity111 , the executive director of the @entity1 @entity112 at @entity113			0
" they know how this all works , " he continued			0
" they 're going to do what they can to get as many votes as possible			0
" and with the @entity5 race being neck and neck in the final sprint to @entity129 , turnout will be a big factor			2
" @entity11 is popular now , and he 's going to help @entity3 get on that front page tomorrow , " @entity111 said			1
that might help deflect attention from @entity47 's big - name visitors			0
former president @entity135 headlines a dinner here thursday night , and former secretary of state @entity137 is slated to be in the state on november 2			0
at the end of the day , it 's the candidates themselves who become the closers of their own race , not their visitors			0
but having top - of - the - list supporters in town certainly does n't hurt			0
" you 're looking for these pivotal points that might help you get half a percentage here , half a percentage there , " @entity111 said .			0

@entity11 and @entity3 kept their distance in 2012
the two are now campaigning together as @entity3 seeks a new @entity5 seat
