-- @entity1 is taking another shot at the tablet game with the @entity4 , the company 's latest @entity6 device to hit @entity9 stores			1
after getting our hands on one yesterday , we found that it 's a solid , well - performing slate that 's easy on the eyes			1
too bad it has such a stupid name			0
the @entity16 is @entity1 's follow - up to its pricey , not terribly popular @entity19 tablet , which was released in february			1
available in 8.2 - inch and 10.1 - inch versions , the @entity20 - powered @entity4 enters the market hot on the heels of the super-hot @entity24			1
it 's on sale today for $ 430 ( for the 8.2 - inch ) or $ 530 ( for the 10.1 - inch ) with a two - year contract from @entity9 , with options for @entity28 or @entity29 of memory on the smaller version , and up to @entity32 on the larger one			1
the first thing that struck me about the @entity4 is its industrial design			0
rather than being perfectly rectangular in shape , the 8.2 - inch slate has clipped corners , which actually makes it fit more comfortably when you hold it one - handed			1
the back , too , shows some stylistic creativity			0
a rubberized outer rim houses a power button and volume rocker , while centered in the back of the tablet is a sheet of dark gray brushed metal held in place by six visible screws			2
the positioning of the device 's only two buttons makes for a clean appearance , but leaves your fingers searching when it 's time to crank up the volume or send it to sleep			0
the 8.2 - inch size , however , is a great compromise between the 7 - inch ' tweeners and 10 - inch stunners			1
it 's small enough to wield in one hand with ease ( the 0.86 - pound weight helps with that too ) , yet large enough that watching a full - screen , hd @entity74 video or a movie on @entity77 is pleasant			1
pair that with @entity9 's @entity80 speeds , and you 've got great streaming video quality			2
the overall experience is smooth , an improvement over many of the past buggy iterations of @entity20 ( perhaps the longer lead time gave @entity88 the room to stabilize )			2
powered by a dual - core 1.2ghz processor with @entity92 of @entity93 , app loading times are reasonably swift , and swiping from one screen to another on its @entity20 interface is stutter - free			1
unlike @entity98 and @entity100 devices , it 's not overly skinned , so you can actually experience the @entity6 os for what it is , rather than a bogged down , bloated mess			0
the @entity4 will be eligible for an @entity106 upgrade at some point in the future , but for now , it runs @entity20 very well			2
both the 8.2 - and 10.1 - inch models have a 1280 x 800 resolution display			1
after turning up the brightness from auto to full , the tablet 's battery life dropped from around 20 percent to around 5 percent in less than an hour , so it looks like you 'll need to be conscious of your @entity80 and brightness settings if you do n't want your tablet to die on you quickly			1
if you 're one of those people who likes to take pictures with their tablet ( read : you are a dork ) , the @entity4 has a 5 - megapixel back - facing camera and a 1.3 - megapixel front - facing camera on its face			2
the rear camera 's quality is relatively sub-par compared to what you 'd get from other comparable cameras , and definitely shoddier compared to the 8 - megapixel standard of most 2011 handsets			2
the colors are bright and close to true to life , but the overall image lacks sharpness			0
the camera does have some variable settings though , for white balance , color effects , and scene mode			0
video quality was also just ' meh ' : a video taken indoors at the @entity0 offices was noticeably grainy			0
overall , the @entity4 seems like a decent tablet			0
the slate looks slick and feels good in your hands , and is powerful enough to provide a successful tablet experience			0
it 's a bit of a shame that it 's shipping with @entity20 instead of @entity20 , but that 's certainly not a deal breaker			1
what 's a real shame , though , is that it 's available now , and not six months ago			0
