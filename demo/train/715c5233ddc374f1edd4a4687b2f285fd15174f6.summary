we were deep into the fall semester at the @entity5 journalism school , where i taught feature writing			1
i was showing the students an example of a travel article , one i had written for the @entity10 about @entity11 , @entity12			2
i read a few paragraphs from the opening scene , with @entity15 44 winding through cranberry bogs , a billboard coming into view with images of gov. @entity20 and @entity21 , the greeting in boldface letters : welcome to @entity11 -- @entity24 , and a black @entity26 hat that conjured up memories of all those @entity29 pageants in grade school when @entity31 said : " speak for yourself , @entity33			1
" a student in the second row said , " who 's @entity33 ? and ... this @entity31 ? " a student in front of her said , " i 've never heard of these people			1
" that 's when a young woman in the front row said , " yeah , i kept wondering , who are these dudes ? " i felt sheer incredulity now			2
" capt. @entity46 ? ! " the no was in the silence			2
a silence that morphed into sympathy			2
they had n't meant to make me feel so bad			1
a student at the other end of the second row squinted in deep thought , admitting that @entity46 sort of rang a bell			2
" was n't he the captain of the ship ? " i did n't know you could get through grade school without those @entity29 pageants and the @entity64 - @entity63 - @entity46 triangle immortalized by @entity65			1
nor did i think you could get through the @entity15 history courses that follow or become a student at one of the top public universities in the land without encountering those names			2
publishers of textbooks have pretty much dropped the @entity26			1
maybe they are sensitive to separation of church and state , or do n't want to jeopardize their sales to schools and school boards			1
it 's true , too , that lots of more recent history has had to be added to textbooks , for @entity84 and the @entity85 , not to mention @entity86 , the space race , the civil rights movement and the too many assassinations and assassination attempts			2
that leaves little or no room for the @entity26 and what they did			1
but i say no more			2
opinion : some uncomfortable truths about @entity29 no more forgetting , casting @entity31 and @entity63 , capt. @entity46 , @entity20 and @entity21 aside -- left in the ditch of history			1
let 's hear it for the @entity26 ! i say this not for personal reasons -- i am a member of the @entity103 -- but because their story is an important part of this country 's history			1
when they boarded the @entity111 in @entity11 , @entity112 , in 1620 , it was not because they did n't have anything better to do			1
they did not sail across the @entity115 , still a great unknown , simply to see what was on the other side			0
they came aboard the ship -- a very small ship for such a big ocean , all the more evident if you have stepped aboard the replica @entity111 -- and sailed west because they had a deep and abiding desire to worship their @entity127 as they saw fit			1
there were 102 of them			2
the @entity26 did not occupy passenger cabins , however small those cabins might have been back then			1
they were considered the cargo for the voyage , and so crossed in the cargo space , the deck -- a dark deck -- below the crew 's quarters			0
halfway across , the ship was damaged by a bad storm			0
in another storm , @entity143 was swept off the deck of the ship into the ocean ; he managed to grab a rope and was pulled back on deck			0
@entity150 was born at sea			0
@entity152 was born after they reached @entity154 the @entity111 dropped anchor in @entity156 on november 22 , 1620			2
( some historians give the date as november 11			0
) later that day 41 men gathered in a cabin to draw up the rules of governance for their colony -- a document that has come to be known as the @entity165			1
those 41 men then affixed their signatures to one of the great liberty documents of history			0
it would become the keystone for the @entity15 @entity172			0
it took almost a month for the search party to find a suitable place for their settlement , but they finally found it : an abandoned @entity180 village with a plentiful water supply , good harbor , cleared fields and a hill on which to build a fort for protection			0
the @entity111 pulled up anchor in @entity156 and dropped anchor in @entity190 december 21			1
just cold , bleak shoreline , with only the trees and hills to offer shelter			0
the first passengers went ashore december 21 -- whether on @entity198 is subject to debate			0
@entity200 , deputy executive director of @entity201 , points out that , as the naval historian @entity204 has noted , men in boats tend to avoid big rocks			0
whatever the truth of the landing , the captain of the @entity111 did not simply put the @entity26 ashore and return to @entity112			1
capt. @entity209 -- not @entity210 -- kept the ship in the harbor so the men could go ashore each day to build homes -- simple , one - room cottages the size of suburban garden sheds today -- then return to the safety of the ship			0
for future safety , a large gun was mounted on a platform atop the hill that overlooked the harbor			0
but the enemy that first winter was the " general sickness , " the near plague of colds , coughs and fevers			0
" because only five to seven men were well enough to tend the sick and bury the dead , " @entity200 said , " a common burial was used			0
" in mid-march 1621 , as the sickness was abating , @entity234 , chief of the @entity180 tribe , appeared and befriended them			0
@entity238 , who had been captured by @entity112 sailors and lived briefly in @entity240 , showed them how to plant corn			1
come spring , when @entity209 prepared to set sail for the return voyage -- a voyage delayed by the loss of members of his crew to the " general sickness " that had claimed so many of his passengers -- he invited any of the @entity26 who wished to do so , to return			1
half of them had died			0
yet not one single one went			0
" by the standards of that day or by the amphibious doctrine of any day , " historian @entity204 wrote , " the leaders of @entity258 took incommensurate risks , yet they came through marvelously well			0
they attributed that success to @entity127 ...			0
but the @entity261 helps those who help themselves , and these people were valiant in the face of danger , resourceful in difficulties , and possessed of an innate common sense , not only in dealing with the fools and rascals among themselves but with the enemy on our coasts , the @entity273			1
" the following autumn , to give thanks for the bounty of their crops and well - being , the @entity26 -- 16 men , four women , 23 children and nine hired seamen or servants -- held a harvest festival			1
the record shows that the bounty included wild fowl , codfish , bass and " a great store of wild turkeys			0
" @entity234 , the chief , arrived with 90 of his men to be " entertained and feasted " in a three - day celebration of the harvest			2
" during the course of the event , " @entity200 said , " they went out and killed five deer , which they presented ceremonially to the men they perceived as the important men in the colony -- an honorific gift			2
" our @entity29 has its roots in that gathering , though -- the wish to give thanks and the gathering to eat			1
cranberries , a native berry the @entity314 introduced them to , apparently got their name from the @entity26			1
the stem so resembled a crane they called them " crane - berries , " shortened over the years to cranberries			0
and pumpkins were such a staple the @entity26 had a verse : we have pumpkins at morning , and pumpkins at noon if it were not for pumpkins , we should soon be undone			1
@entity29 by the numbers so , welcome your family -- or make the trip " to grandmother 's house " -- enjoy the @entity29 football games , carve the turkey , add the dollop of cranberry sauce , save room for the pumpkin pie ... and remember the @entity26			1
as i hope the students in my class do too , now , with their families and possibly their children .			0

@entity344 : many people do n't know roots of @entity29 , story of @entity26 in 1620
she says 102 people sailed from @entity112 to @entity350 seeking *religious* *freedom*
they landed , drew up @entity165 , built colony at barren , wintry @entity190
@entity344 : to celebrate harvest next fall , they had @entity29 meal with @entity273
