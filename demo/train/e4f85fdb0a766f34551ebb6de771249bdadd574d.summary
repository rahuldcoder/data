@entity0 -- at first glance , it 's a hoax : a storefront for a museum of @entity5 , complete with a bizarre animal skeleton visible through the front window and unicorn tears for sale			1
it 's perfect for luring in curious children			2
but when volunteers get kids past the upside - down coyote hanging from the ceiling and the owl with an elephant trunk , they shape young minds with after - school tutoring , writing workshops and books written by kids			1
" i think the kids are tricked in and then , as they are talking to the person at the front desk , they are learning about what 's going on in the tutoring center , " said @entity24 , the chief executive of @entity25 , the nonprofit network of tutoring centers that look nothing like classrooms			1
the @entity0 " museum , " which set up shop in the @entity39 neighborhood in october , was the latest branch to open			1
each of the eight centers has an imaginative storefront that helps raise money and encourage creativity among students			1
in @entity47 , kids are lured into the writing lab by the @entity49 , which sells intergalactic peace treaties and travel cups			1
in @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 sells robot emotion upgrades , fruit powered clocks and robodentures			0
the original chapter opened eight years ago at 826 valencia st. in @entity61 's @entity60			1
( as it spread , the original address inspired the name @entity25			1
) it was co-founded by @entity65 , author of " @entity66 , " and founder of the publishing house , @entity69 's			0
early on , organizers at 826 @entity71 learned the space they 'd rented was zoned for retail , so they needed to come up with something to sell			2
the space looked a bit like an old pirate ship			0
" someone thought , ' why do n't we sell pirate gear and see what happens ? ' " @entity78 said			0
since then , it has been fronted by @entity84 , where shoppers can purchase hooks , peg legs and plank - by - the - foot			0
now , @entity78 said , profits from stores account for 20 percent of the teaching that goes on in the writing center			2
and the imagination enticements work			0
@entity25 is on track to serve 24,000 students this year through its tutoring centers and school outreach programs			1
sisters @entity97 and @entity99 have been visiting @entity101 most afternoons since it opened			1
" this place is awesome , " said @entity99 , 10 , as she worked on her multiplication homework with volunteer @entity103			0
" i really , really need help with my homework and my parents are busy sometimes			0
" " sometimes we do poetry , sometimes we do math , " said @entity97 , 9			0
when she does n't have homework , she works on the story she is writing about a mermaid named @entity114			2
writing is the primary focus at 826 centers , which also work with middle school and high school students			1
it also publishes books written by students			2
their latest , " @entity126 to where you used to live , " is a collection of student letters to first lady @entity125			1
it will be in bookstores on december 15			0
the letters run the gamut from asking if @entity125 cooks with an @entity133 at the @entity134 , to a suggestion that she use robots to keep drugs off the streets			1
the book is a companion to one that came out last year that contains letters to president @entity144 , " thanks and have fun running the @entity146			1
" profits from the book sales are used to support the tutoring centers			1
@entity150 , an @entity151 professor at @entity152 , said the 826 national centers complement the learning that goes on in classrooms			1
schools are about college and job readiness , and tests that prove it , @entity156 said			0
those demands do n't leave much time for playful reading or imaginative writing , even if it could help some students learn			2
" if you want people to engage in activity , you find a way for them to have fun with it			0
826 is a genius at that , " said @entity156 , a past president of the @entity171			2
" if [ students ] do n't take any pleasure in it , they wo n't actually practice it			0
when they have fun , they wo n't quit on you			0
" fun is what draws students in , too			0
" it 's ok to be strange , " said @entity78 , the 826 leader			2
" it 's ok to be magical , it 's ok to be whimsical			0
