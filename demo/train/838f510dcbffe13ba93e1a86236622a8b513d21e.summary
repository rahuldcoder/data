-- slide on your glasses as you hit the streets of @entity4			1
here , amongst the @entity6 , eclectic little coffeehouse - supporters and bookstore - browsing literary crowd , it 's hip to be nerdy			1
@entity10 , @entity4 street style blogger for @entity12 , came to @entity14 's largest city five years ago and has been captivated by the unique city vibe ever since			1
" i 've lived all over the world , " @entity10 said			1
" i came to this conclusion that there 's no perfect place			2
then , i came to @entity4 and it 's kind of like the perfect city for me			1
it 's just full of creative types , and i 'm staying ! " besides owning a good coat and boots ( " a must " ) to combat @entity4 's long cold , rainy season , the locals are jazzing up their style with splashes of color , designer finds and thrifty picks			1
below , @entity10 explains @entity4 's bright style			1
@entity0 : what would you call the street style in @entity4 ? @entity10 : a lot of people like to support local fashion designers here , so what i find is people will invest in a designer piece and the rest of the outfit will be thrifted			1
people are very conscious of where they spend their money here			0
@entity0 : what is unique about the style ? @entity10 : this " mash - up " of a mix between local designers and thrift finds			1
it may be emerging in other cities , but @entity4 is doing it to an extreme			2
often they 'll go with an indie designer , a unique and cool company , or invest in a great pair of shoes , or something along those lines			2
they might have a thrifted dress and a fabulous necklace from @entity69			0
maybe they found their entire outfit for free on the street but their shoes are from @entity74 & @entity75			2
the fashion capital of @entity77 @entity0 : have you seen any trends emerging from that style ? @entity10 : one trend that is never going to go away here is looking smart			1
wearing glasses , that kind of nerdy cool will always be popular			2
it 's a very bookish kind of town and this is the only place i 've ever lived where i see people reading while walking down the street all the time			2
people here love to be informed and well - read , and i think that kind of academic nerdiness will always be fashionable			0
there is also a new trend for colorful tights			0
the rest of the outfit will be toned down , grays and blacks , with a very bright tight			2
there is some crazy neon tight action going on here ! it 's not all country in @entity109 @entity0 : where do people shop in @entity4 ? @entity10 : there are a lot of nice boutiques in @entity4 that carry the local designers , like @entity116 and @entity117			1
@entity118 and a lot of the designers have their shops by appointment only as well			0
some of the designers that come to mind are @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity74 , as well as @entity129 's @entity128 , @entity130 , @entity131 ( @entity132 ) and @entity133 ( @entity134 )			0
as far as thrift stores go , there are tons here			0
i would say there 's some in each neighborhood			0
@entity141 style : it 's unforgettable @entity0 : when you 're out on the street , how do you choose people for your photos ? is there a key element ? @entity10 : i always look for that little something extra			1
they have to have something unique about the way they put their look together			0
i always like to see what shoes they 're wearing , i love seeing good examples of layering , color combinations , textures , good styling is key			0
basically if it makes me look twice , in a good way , then i stop them			0
typically , i have found that the people who are stylish here tend to go where artists have always gone , and that would be the coffeehouses			0
i call it my " coffeehouse tour " while scouting and i usually go through about eight shots of espresso .			0
