-- for those of you who are schoolteachers , you will understand what i am about to relate			2
while at the car repair facility , look for certifications displayed on the wall			1
you lay out a lesson plan to teach a particular topic , for example , how to solve a basic algebraic equation			2
you proceed to follow the plan , working with your students until you feel they understand the necessary mathematical principles			2
a couple of weeks pass and , low and behold , you discover that there are several people who have somehow forgotten what they appeared to have learned ! they look at you like you 're speaking another language , and you realize you have to start over with the basics again			1
frustrated , you repeat the same process until you think they have it , and low and behold , it happens again			2
sound familiar ? i understand your plight			2
i get the same question from my readers over and over : " how do i find a good auto repair shop ? ! what do i look for ? ! " i 've written reams on this subject			1
as a matter of fact , i 've even created a separate section within my web site to make this information available , and still the question keeps coming up			0
so for those of you who have either never read my columns pertaining to this topic , or have " forgotten , " allow me to refresh your memory with a few updates			0
before i start , i want to emphasize that the question " how do i find a good auto repair shop ? " represents a universal concern			1
this question comes to me from virtually all over the world on a regular basis ( @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , just to name a few )			0
an interesting story related to this concern : a man from @entity53 ( his name is @entity57 ) asked me if i would come to @entity53 and open an auto repair shop with him , because there was such a need			1
to quote @entity61 , " there is great opportunity for great profits to be made			0
" he said he would front all the money we needed for a building and equipment			1
in jest , i pointed out to him that i was not proficient in camel repair and would have to decline			1
" @entity74 , people who can afford a car in @entity53 are wealthy , and they usually drive a @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , or a @entity79 , and not a camel ! i.e. @entity81 and the like			0
" i still found myself declining the offer , after watching the reaction on my wife 's face to the possibility			0
anyway , it just goes to show you , car care problems are the same everywhere ! @entity90 autos : most stolen cars so what is the answer to the universal perplexity pertaining to auto repair ? first of all , start shopping for a repair facility before you need one			1
why ? because a more sound decision is made when you 're not facing an urgent need for transportation because your vehicle just broke down			0
we all make poorer choices when we are under the stress of the moment			0
@entity90 autos : 10 best cars of 2009 call around to various repair shops and ask them if they are members of associations such as : " @entity113 , " " @entity114 , " " @entity115 , " " aaa , " or " @entity116			1
" membership is these associations means the shop has qualified in some way			1
for instance , to become a @entity122 , a shop must undergo a rigorous investigation			1
in addition to having state - of - the - art equipment , training , qualified technicians , and information systems in place , the shop must score high with its customers			1
@entity122 contacts about 100 of the shop 's most recent customers and conducts a @entity137 ) study			1
@entity90 autos : top 5 crossover vehicles they ask the customers such questions as : was the estimate accurate ( or significantly less than the actual bill ) ? was the job done on time ? did they fix it right the first time ? what kind of warranty did they give you ? was the shop clean and presentable ? did they offer a ride to work or wherever you needed to go ? was there a comfortable , pleasant , and clean waiting area ? if the repair facility passes the test , it can hang the " @entity122 " shingle			1
as you can see , membership in associations such as the ones mentioned above is a significant qualifier for a shop			1
@entity90 autos : best selling sedans visit the shop			0
is it clean and orderly ? or does it look like it ought to be condemned by the health department ? ask customers in the shop , " why do you do business with this shop ? " answers such as " they are the cheapest " or " they offer a lot of specials " or " because the owner is a friend of my father 's " do n't have much credibility			1
look for responses such as : " they fix my car right the first time			0
" " i can trust them to do the job at a fair price			0
" " they welcome my questions and concerns and take the time to answer them			0
" " there are never any surprises when i come to pick up the car			0
" " they patiently explain in plain @entity51 what the problem is and explain my options			0
" @entity90 autos : cars with best resale values while at the facility , look for certifications displayed on the wall			1
if there are n't any , then ask to see their qualifications ; this will tell you a lot about the facility			1
what shingles and certifications should you look for ? do the technicians have certification from @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity114 , and / or manufacturers such as @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , etc. ? do they have after market training from such leaders as @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , or @entity236 ? how about continued education from boces or a technical college such as an @entity240 or @entity241 ? these shingles indicate that the technicians have taken the initiative to go beyond the requirements to keep up with the changes in their field			0
this indicates serious interest as well as pride in their work ( not to mention the fact that they are trained in the latest technology )			0
and this extra training not only takes time , but costs them a lot of money ! in addition , membership in such associations as the @entity262 ( @entity262 ) , @entity263 ( @entity264 ) , @entity114 ( @entity265 ) , @entity266 ( @entity267 on @entity268 ) , and @entity223 ( @entity269 ) tells you that the owner of the shop cares about the quality of the workmanship and , most likely , operates by a code of ethics required by the association			1
in addition , membership in these associations usually means that the shop is willing to subject itself to an arbitration process that is binding , should the need for arbitration between customer and shop arise			2
another factor to consider when choosing a repair facility is the equipment available			1
is the shop equipped with state - of - the - art equipment , such as hand held computer scanners and diagnostic software , digital volt - ohm meters , logic probes , lab scopes , and on - line computer systems like @entity298 , @entity299 , or @entity300 ? do n't be afraid to ask the shop if they have this equipment			1
these systems and tools are necessary to diagnose and repair your hi - tech car accurately			2
without them , fixing your automobile is a hit - and - miss proposition			0
sometimes it 's best to take your car to a specialist			0
specialists cost more money initially			0
but because they are specialists , they often know how to pinpoint and repair certain types of problems more efficiently and effectively			2
why ? because they deal with these problems every day , plus they have the knowledge , equipment , and information systems necessary to get directly to the problem			2
while " @entity331 " is floundering and replacing parts trying to correct the problem , the specialist diagnoses with laser - like accuracy			0
he can locate the problem and replace only the parts that are necessary			0
less guesswork and fewer parts translates into money in your pocket , even though the labor rate is higher ! do n't be short - sighted ! common areas of automotive specialties : transmission and @entity343 @entity344 , @entity345 , and @entity346 collision repair foreign car repair @entity349 ( heating , @entity351 , @entity352 ) @entity353 remember , consider the long - term cost			1
do n't sell yourself short for a few bucks			1
quality repair is not expensive ... it 's priceless ! equipment , information systems , and technical training must be up to date ! a final note about shop size			1
some people think that the cost of repair varies with the size of the shop ( a large shop or dealership is probably more expensive )			2
not true ! these days , with the high cost of equipment , training , and information systems , the cost of repair at dealerships , large repair facilities and small shops is balancing out			1
as a matter of fact , in a lot of cases , i see the larger entities , such as the dealers and larger repair facilities , offering competitive pricing to the little guys			2
if service facilities meet the criteria i discussed ( and the quality of the parts and warranties are similar ) you will find prices are about the same , regardless of size			2
so your decision at this point is a matter of whom you feel most comfortable dealing with			0
some people prefer a larger shop or their dealership , others prefer a smaller shop			0
do n't trust your $ 25,000 automobile , which carries your family through life 's daily trips , to just anyone			2
pick your repair facility like you would your family doctor			1
in the long run , this approach saves you not only money , but time and aggravation			0
even more importantly , a well maintained vehicle is a safer one			0

start shopping for a repair facility before you need one
ask if they are members of associations such as " @entity113 " or " @entity122 "
another factor to consider is the equipment available
do n't sell yourself short for a few bucks . quality repair is priceless
