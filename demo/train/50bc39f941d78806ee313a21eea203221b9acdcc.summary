@entity0 -- shortly after @entity2 left the @entity3 in 1999 to teach at her alma mater , @entity4 , the nationwide controversy over military recruiting on campus had just begun to heat up			1
@entity2 and fellow academics had actively sought to block military recruiters from @entity4 because of the @entity10 " policy on removing openly homosexual service members			1
@entity2 later supported other schools challenging a federal law -- known as the @entity15 -- requiring that recruiters be given equal access or face the loss of federal funding			1
the @entity20 unanimously upheld the law on march 6 , 2006			0
just four months after taking the job as @entity4 's dean , in october 2003 , @entity2 offered students her thoughts in a campuswide e-mail , saying that to give recruiters equal access to the campus " causes me deep distress			1
i abhor the military 's discriminatory recruitment policy			1
" she called it " a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order			0
" the same week as the high court 's 2006 ruling in favor of the military , a top @entity10 official wrote colleagues in an internal memo of the department 's efforts " to limit the polarizing nature of the @entity46 who now rattle sabers over an intent to shout down the military			2
" @entity51 , then deputy undersecretary for military personnel policy , noted , " @entity52 is a case in point because she reportedly ' encouraged students to demonstrate against the presence of recruiters ... ( and ) to express their views clearly and forcefully			2
' not a true fan of ' equality and scope ' it would appear			0
" in @entity64 v. @entity65 , the high court unanimously upheld the @entity15			0
" a military recruiter 's mere presence on campus does not violate a law school 's right to associate , regardless of how repugnant the law school considers the recruiter 's message , " said chief justice @entity66			2
before that ruling , the issue at @entity4 was how much access to allow the recruiters			2
@entity2 sought to have campus visits coordinated by student veteran groups , not the @entity83 office , and wanted the military not to appear alongside civilian recruiters			1
negotiations with the @entity10 and @entity4 continued for years , with frustration expressed by both sides			0
documents released by the @entity10 over the weekend show that overall , @entity2 's involvement was minimal and that the ultimate decision allowing military access was made by the school 's president , @entity93			1
but the memos show the two apparently clashed over the issue			0
@entity98 chairman @entity97 , @entity99 , said saturday that @entity2 acted responsibly and allowed military recruiters at the @entity4			1
" the materials produced by the @entity103 provide further documentation that military recruiters were never barred from the campus of @entity4 , neither before @entity2 became dean , nor during her tenure , " @entity97 said in a written statement			1
" the unfair charge made by some that @entity2 broke the law as dean continues to have no basis in law or fact			2
" but the panel 's ranking member , sen. @entity117 @entity116 , has been very outspoken over @entity2 's handing of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " controversy			0
" @entity120 was created and implemented by president @entity121			0
where was her outrage during the five years she served in the @entity125 ? why would she blame the military ? they did n't pass the rule			0
it was @entity130 and the president , " @entity117 said			0
" instead of taking a stand in @entity0 , ms. @entity2 waited until she got to @entity4 and stood in the way of devoted , hardworking military recruiters			1

@entity2 sought to block military recruiters from @entity4 because of " @entity120 "
said in memo , " i abhor the military 's discriminatory recruitment policy "
documents show decision allowing military access made by school president , not @entity2
@entity97 says @entity2 acted responsibly and allowed recruiters at @entity4
