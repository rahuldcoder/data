-- whoever came up with the phrase " location is everything " when it comes to real estate must have had @entity7 in mind			1
this tiny island nation sits in the middle of the @entity11 , about 60 miles south of @entity12 and 180 miles east of the @entity14 coast at @entity15			1
the result is that anyone who was anyone visited , settled , invaded or conquered this prime piece of land			2
and with each leaving their mark , a visit to @entity7 is truly a journey through the region 's history			1
the @entity7 is actually three islands			1
the country 's name comes from the largest of the three ; to the northwest of that is @entity32 , and in between them is @entity34			2
and tiny really means tiny			0
at only 122 square miles ( 316 square kilometers ) , the total area of the country is about one - tenth the size of @entity38 , by far the smallest of the @entity39			0
@entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 -- each of these metropolitan areas is bigger than @entity7			1
that compactness , coupled with an extensive bus system , lets you see the best of what it has to offer with ease			0
begin your journey through the millennia with the stone temples at @entity56 and @entity57 , on the southern coast			1
construction on these sites started around 3600 @entity61 , making them centuries older than the best guesses we have for @entity66 's @entity65			0
and the temples are every bit as mysterious , since it is not clear how or why they were built			2
the structures are n't as massive as their @entity66 counterpart , and they lack the graceful symmetry			0
yet walk among the exposed chambers -- with the sea just beyond the cliffs -- and you know that the generations who built these temples believed they were constructing something for the ages			2
it is here that you start to get a sense of what sets a journey to @entity7 apart from @entity88 's more visited travel destinations			1
@entity56 and @entity57 are just two of seven ancient temples that make up a @entity90 described by a leading prehistorian as " the oldest free - standing monuments in the world			1
" these sites represent just one epoch of many you will find on your trip			0
travel seven miles ( 11 kilometers ) to the east -- and skip forward more than 2,000 years from the time the stones for those temples were laid -- and you will be standing where the first seafaring @entity101 arrived on @entity7 from the eastern end of the @entity11			1
to this day the village of @entity105 is a key port for the country 's fishing industry , seen in the market held every sunday and in the seafood restaurants lining the harbor			0
but look closely at the colorfully painted traditional fishing boats known as luzzu bobbing gently on the water , and you ca n't help but notice how they are still painted with the @entity118 , a custom said to have been handed down by the @entity101 to ward off evil			0
from @entity105 head northwest 10 miles ( 16 kilometers ) inland toward the walled city of @entity122 , which sits on one of the highest plateaus on the island			2
just outside the main gate of this walled city is the @entity128 , or " roman house			0
" here we have moved forward another thousand years to when @entity7 was part of the @entity132			1
the @entity134 is a museum built on the excavated ruins of a nobleman 's home , dating back to sometime shortly after 100 b.c. while the museum on the main floor houses a respectable collection of artifacts , it is the excavated floors of the villa -- among the finest mosaics uncovered anywhere in the former empire -- that will astonish you			2
as for @entity122 itself , the city 's name comes from the @entity154 word simply meaning " the city , " which belies its status as the former capital of @entity7			1
a millennium after our @entity134 nobleman walked across his tiled floors @entity7 was part of the @entity162 -- a form of government based on the tenets of @entity166 -- that stretched across northern @entity14 and into the @entity167			1
it was during this period that the moat and walls that surround @entity122 were first constructed			0
with few vehicles permitted today inside its gates , a walk through the narrow stone alleys of @entity122 makes it clear why it is known locally as " the silent city			0
" for one of the best views anywhere on @entity7 , make your way to the upper terrace of the @entity182 restaurant			1
on a clear day over a cup of coffee you can see practically the entire island			2
while the island nation has changed hands countless times over the ages , the influence that is most widely felt in @entity7 today did n't come from an invading empire , but from a group known as the @entity193 , later the @entity193			1
this order was first set up to run a hospital in @entity196 for pilgrims who traveled there and eventually developed into a religious and military order			0
when @entity166 forces pushed them out in 1291 , the @entity193 re-established themselves first in @entity201 and then in @entity202 before arriving on @entity7 in the 16th century			1
it was in those first decades on the island that the @entity193 built the current capital , @entity206 , following an unsuccessful siege by @entity209 forces			2
with its impenetrable stone walls and regular battle towers surrounding a regular grid of streets , the entire city stands as tribute to the order 's military and engineering prowess			0
within the battlements , the interiors of churches such as @entity222 , completed in 1577 , are among the most ornate that you will find anywhere			0
these monuments , like those reaching back into prehistory , outlasted both their creators and those who followed to lay their own claim to @entity7			1
the @entity193 were forced out by the @entity231 , when @entity232 invaded in 1798 , who were expelled a couple years later by the @entity234			2
@entity235 saw a failed attempt by @entity237 to bomb the country into submission			0
today @entity7 , still as staunchly @entity241 as it was under the @entity193 , is content to take its place as part of the @entity244			1
a trip to @entity7 is not merely a walk through a living history book			1
along the way are stunning natural formations , like the @entity250 on the southern coast near the village of @entity253			0
when the weather permits and seas are not too choppy , boats take visitors to the 140 - foot - high natural stone arch and surrounding caves			0
of course , on an island this small you are never far from the coast , though sun seekers often head to the beaches of the northern resort of @entity264 to soak in the rays			2
the cafés and wine bars of modern - day @entity206 make you feel like you 're in southern @entity272 , as will much of the cuisine			0
the nightlife at the clubs in @entity276 's , just north of @entity206 , can hold its own against just about anything the rest of @entity88 has to offer			0
prices for hotels and restaurants overall are less than on mainland @entity88 , especially in the off - season , and the bus system on @entity7 makes getting around simple and affordable			1
full - day tickets are only € 1.50 ( about $ 2			0
) you can get pretty much anywhere from the main terminal just outside the @entity206 city gate			0
no matter where you go and what you see , @entity7 's unique spot -- in the @entity11 and in history -- is felt everywhere .			1

seven ancient temples date back more than *5,000* years
