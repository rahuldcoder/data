@entity0 -- @entity2 looks much like any other back room in a @entity0 bar			1
but at show time , the @entity7 mainland 's first and only full - time stand - up comedy club becomes a carefully - honed weapon of mass hilarity directed at the audience of locals , expats and tourists that frequently packs the room			1
the club is at the epicenter of a thriving stand - up scene that a few years ago did not exist in the city , and that ultimately could bring stand - up comedy -- an artform virtually unknown in @entity23 -- to the masses			1
@entity2 started in february 2011 when a small group of enthusiastic novices put on a show in the corner of a dive bar			0
the group 's @entity31 founder , @entity30 , is the first to admit it was " as bad as you 'd expect			0
" they spent the next year honing their craft			0
towards the end of 2012 a downtown sports bar offered them permanent use of a room			0
the @entity7 mainland had its first full - time comedy club			1
the group holds three open mics a week -- two in @entity47 , one in @entity7 -- plus weekend showcases , and also brings in professionals from across the world			1
in its wake , other open mics have sprung up , giving comedians -- both locals and expats -- stage time in which to develop			0
deadpan delivery @entity59 is a local @entity0 comedian who performs in @entity47 , sharing her surreal musings with a mesmerizingly deadpan delivery			1
" doing stand - up comedy helps me , a very introverted person , express my weird thoughts , " she says			1
" when i 'm telling a joke , i 'm not really trying to be funny , i 'm trying to express ideas that the audience might find amusing			0
" the candid self - expression of stand - up is one of the aspects that appeals to the younger generation in @entity23 , according to the founders of @entity2 's @entity7 - language counterpart , @entity74			1
@entity75 and @entity76 were inspired by the success @entity78 was having with @entity47 - language stand - up			1
but with stand - up a virtually unknown concept in @entity23 , they marketed their first few shows as networking events			1
" we said let 's have a party , and we can tell jokes , " says @entity75			0
" this way we did n't have to explain what stand - up was			1
then , step by step , we introduced the concept , linking it to similar concepts in traditional @entity7 comedy			1
@entity74 now puts on monthly theater shows that attract between 800 and 1,000 people			0
it has around 14 regular comedians , and holds workshops to train others			0
while stand - up is a tough sell to the older generation , who were brought up in a culture " based on wanting people to be the same , " @entity76 says there is a thirst for it among younger people			1
" we really feel like we 're helping a generation by giving them an outlet so they can do new things and be themselves			0
many people are making money , but they are not happy			0
everyone has this hidden side to them , " he says			0
alien art form ? @entity124 - based comic @entity123 was the first international headliner @entity78 brought to the city in 2012			1
in september 2013 he returned for a 10 - month residency at the club			2
@entity123 was particularly impressed by the young @entity7 comedians he saw performing an art form alien to their culture , and in their second language			1
" the @entity7 youth are the coolest , " he says			2
" local comedians like @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity59 get up and talk about their feelings , and audiences that were 10 % @entity7 go up to 35 % @entity7			2
the next great frontier for comedy is @entity23 , and the heart will be @entity0 , " says @entity123			1
curtain agrees that seeing @entity7 comics emerge is the most exciting thing about his role , and that @entity7 rather than expats are the club 's ultimate target audience			2
" there are more and more ' haigui ' -- @entity7 who were educated overseas -- returning to @entity23			1
they really want to see stand - up , " he says			1
in the meantime , @entity0 is getting a name for itself on the international comedy circuit			2
big names to have visited include @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			0
@entity30 says they get emails every week from established comedians looking to come out , and that they turn down a lot more people than they accept			2
later this year , @entity169 comic @entity168 will start a two - month residency , while @entity2 will move to a larger floor of its host bar , expanding its capacity to some 150 seats			0
there are also plans to set up comedy rooms across the country so comics can regularly tour more out - of - the - way spots			2
restrictions for aspiring comics , it 's a great time to be in @entity0			2
one of the founding members of @entity2 , @entity184 , now splits her time between @entity0 and @entity185 , where she hosts the @entity186 at @entity187			2
she says when she sees comedians who are just starting out in @entity185 , she wants to tell them to move to @entity0			2
" although there are fewer opportunities to get on stage in @entity0 , the quality of the stage time for those starting out is incomparable , " she says			0
" it 's easier to stick with it , because the good sets will far outnumber the bad			0
you also get to do longer sets			0
" but can stand - up -- the art form of agitators such as @entity202 and @entity203 -- flourish in @entity23 as anything other than a neutered imitation ? @entity30 says they have a good idea of what 's not allowed			1
" it 's kind of like living in @entity23 -- once you know what the rules are , you 're pretty much free to do anything else , " he says			0
" the restriction the government places on us is no greater than the restriction the audience places on us			0
" for @entity123 , the restrictions are part of what makes things interesting			0
" @entity23 is changing and opening up , and @entity0 is the perfect place for the experiment			1
they are saying ' do n't think for a moment we are n't watching , but go ahead , we want to check this out			0
