-- the smells of oil , tires and hard work surround @entity5 as he stands on the @entity8 production line			0
he 's one of the thousands of employees at the auto plant in the @entity12 town of @entity13 , a cog in @entity16 's crucial sector : car manufacturing			1
" it 's not easy working in this industry , it 's got its challenges , " says @entity18			0
" but i frequently go to the @entity23 and when you see a @entity8 car go down the road and you tell your friend that you were part of that process that puts the car together ... that fills you up with pride			0
" regional economy after a decade working with @entity8 cars , @entity5 has seen a lot			0
as a production operator at the factory in @entity12 's self - proclaimed @entity38 , he 's not far from the ocean in a province known for its auto - sector			1
" if you look at the @entity16 it 's one of your poorest provinces in the country , " says @entity18			2
" my understanding is that we 've got about three car factories in the @entity16 and i can not imagine what kind of province we would have had those factories not been in the @entity16 , " he continues			2
@entity53 , a native of the region and @entity8 's managing director in @entity12 , says auto - companies in the area are catalysts for economic growth			1
" whilst we employ 4,000 people , we create a multiply effect through the economy , " he says			0
one way this effect is made manifest is in the number of companies making car components in the area			0
in fact , the @entity68 says there are 40,000 auto - sector jobs in the province , 75 % of which are created by supplier companies			1
and it 's not just the jobs @entity8 creates that makes it popular in @entity12			1
the company 's products dominate the roads , accounting for almost 23 % of @entity12 's passenger car market according to the @entity83 of @entity12			1
that means the company sold more passenger cars in @entity12 than any other brand -- a title @entity8 celebrated for the fourth consecutive year in 2012			2
but @entity8 is not the only global car brand with production plants and ambition in the region			0
auto giants like @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 have big operations in the @entity16			2
while @entity95 is focused on making engines in the country , @entity94 has produced some of their best - selling cars in @entity12			2
the region puts together half of the country 's passenger vehicles , according to the @entity68 , but it is also essential for other markets			0
over half of @entity12 's vehicle exports are produced there			1
engines of growth what 's changing is where these cars are being sold			0
while @entity116 and @entity117 have been the key markets , these days more cars are being exported to other @entity12 markets			2
in fact , @entity12 countries are the second biggest market for car components made in @entity12 after the @entity124 it 's this aspect of the market that executives think will drive growth			1
@entity129 , vice president of sales , services and marketing at @entity96 , says that @entity12 's middle class will be buying two and a half million new cars a year by 2020			1
given that current new sales are around 1.7 million vehicles , he 's optimistic about @entity12 's future			1
the auto sector makes up about 7 % of @entity12 's economic output -- a crucial chunk			1
with the @entity16 being so key to the country 's vehicle exports , some compare it to @entity116 's @entity144 : @entity144			1
" we have @entity146 , @entity96 , @entity95 and @entity8 with all the production in the eastern cape province , " says @entity53			0
" so to some extent we could fairly say that we are the @entity144 , but with that comes quite a responsibility			0
if you look at the history of @entity144 , it 's gone into decline because of the over dependence on the auto - sector and the number of companies in the auto - sector that went through the very difficult times , " he continues			1
" the auto - sector is an anchor tenant in the province , we are an important driver of growth -- but we have to recognize that that brings risks			1
" risky business challenges are fresh in the minds of the region 's auto executives			1
in 2013 weeks of strikes meant production lines lost over 45,000 vehicles which translated into lost revenues of about r20 billion -- approximately $ 1.8 billion			0
it was only after the @entity181 union , which represents auto workers , negotiated a new pay deal that workers went back to the factories			0
another serious issue weighing on the minds of car manufactures is the disposable income in consumers ' pockets			0
indeed , the union says that 's why the latest data shows new vehicle sales are falling			2
with sales of new vehicle at 55,722 in august 2014 , they 're down 1.4 % compared to the same period last year			2
and these difficulties are clear to executive and workers alike			0
" if the @entity16 had to close down all its factories , " @entity18 reflects , " we will not be a ghost town -- we will become a ghost province			0

the @entity16 provides 51 % of @entity12 's vehicle exports
approximately 40,000 people are employed in the @entity16 's auto - sector
the auto sector makes up about 7 % of @entity12 's economic output
@entity12 countries are the second biggest market for @entity12 's *automotive* component exports
