@entity0 described how she was raped on her first military assignment , two weeks before her 19th birthday			1
she described how , later that year , she was raped by another soldier in her unit			1
then came sexual harassment by two officers -- including one who requested that she be moved to work directly for him , she said wednesday			0
testifying before lawmakers , the former @entity10 specialist described the " anguish " and " entrapment " she felt , and the horror of the ordeal that followed			1
" i no longer have any faith or hope that the military chain of command will consistently prosecute , convict , sentence and carry out the sentencing of sexual predators in uniform without absconding justice somehow , " she told the @entity17 's subcommittee on personnel			1
" it even starts at recruitment , " she said			0
" we have quite a few of our men and women that are being raped and sexually harassed during the recruitment process			1
" @entity0 was one of four alleged victims who testified wednesday about a problem the military has acknowledged			1
about 19,000 men and women suffer sexual assault each year in the military , former defense secretary @entity42 said , though he noted that only about 3,200 assaults were reported			1
about 10,700 of those cases -- 56 % -- involved male victims in 2010 , based on anonymous reporting collected by the military			1
in painful , dramatic testimony , three women and one man , all of whom have left the military , described their suffering -- and explained why , in some cases , they never filed reports			1
they helped paint a picture of the military as a place where victims are often pressured to remain quiet or endure having their reputations and careers tarnished for coming forward			1
high - ranking representatives from each military branch also gave statements , each one saying how brave they thought those troops had been in telling their stories openly			1
they stressed that special victims ' units have been established along with training to recognize , investigate and prosecute cases involving rape			1
maj. gen. @entity73 , the director of the @entity75 's @entity74 and @entity76 , said that in his five decades of service , he 's seen massive cultural change in the military , including racial tolerance and increasing acceptance of gay and lesbian troops			2
changing attitudes toward sexual assault will be no different			0
only when rape within the military is treated with the same revulsion as friendly - fire will he believe a shift has actually occurred , he said			1
' chaplain told me the rape was @entity94 ' @entity95 was sexually harassed by a team leader to such an extent that she needed mental health care and medication , she said			1
" one week before my unit was scheduled to return back to the @entity101 , i was raped by another service member that had worked with our team			2
" initially , i chose not to do a report of any kind because i had no faith in my chain of command , as my first sergeant previously had sexual harassment accusations against him , and the unit climate was extremely sexist and hostile in nature towards women , " she said			2
later , she filed a restricted report against her rapist and the team leader			0
a year later , the former sergeant testified , she bumped into her rapist in a store , who told her he had been moved to her new location			1
" i was so re-traumatized from the unexpectedness of seeing him that i removed myself from training and immediately sought out the assistance from an @entity10 chaplain who told me , among other things , that the rape was @entity132 's will and that @entity132 was trying to get my attention so that i would go back to church , " she testified			1
" again , i did not file an unrestricted report against my rapist			0
" " six months later , a friend called me and told me they had found pictures of me online that my perpetrator had taken during my rape			1
" so she turned to the @entity142 , which carried out a full investigation , she said			0
an investigator had her describe in detail what was happening in each of the photos			0
after months passed , she said , she was told that her rapist had told investigators that he had had consensual sex with @entity95			2
the command did not pursue adultery charges , and the case was closed			0
" the military criminal justice system is broken , " @entity95 said			2
later , after the hearing , @entity95 posted a message on @entity156 : " i have your name , chaplain			2
" sen. @entity161 of @entity162 told military leaders that he appreciated their comments but criticized them for giving " lawyer - like " statements			1
the problem of sexual assault in the military is a problem that demands a more immediate response			2
he called " sexual assault " as an " immensely destructive force , " likening the assaults to the problem the military first grappled with years ago over strengthening its insufficient body armor so that the armor could withstand ied blasts			2
male victim : ' the culture of victim blaming must end ' male service members are victims , of course , and @entity184 reminded senators of that wednesday			2
@entity184 told senators he felt " humbled " to be " the first male survivor to testify in front of @entity189 on this very important issue			2
" after enlisting in the @entity191 in 1997 , he was raped by a superior officer during his first tour , he said			2
" i was ordered by my command not to report this crime			0
" then , he said , " i was misdiagnosed with a personality disorder " and was discharged			0
that remains on his record , he said			0
" the military has shoved many survivors out the back door with inaccurate , misleading , and very harmful , almost weaponized , medical diagnoses like personality disorders that affect their benefits and future employment opportunities , " he said			2
@entity0 also said many victims are let go with " less than honorable discharges and personality disorders on their records , further hindering them from applying for medical treatment and medical claims			0
" " the culture of victim blaming and retaliation while failing to punish the perpetrator must end , " @entity184 said			0
" we also need to ensure that prevention efforts are inclusive of male service members			0
... we can not marginalize male survivors and send a message that men can not be raped , and , therefore , are not real survivors , " the former officer said			1
but , as senators pointed out , there are few convictions made in the military			0
according to a 2010 @entity75 study , only 8 % of sexual assailants are referred to military court , compared with 40 % of similar offenders prosecuted in the civilian court system			0
military ' desperately needs to be shown the next steps ' @entity237 , director of the @entity238 , was the fourth victim who testified			1
she said that in her years as a @entity242 officer , she " experienced daily discrimination and sexual harassment , " which included rape jokes and " commercial sexual exploitation of women and girls			1
" while stationed at an infantry school , " i witnessed reports of rape , sexual assault and sexual harassment swept under the rug by a handful of field grade officers			0
" perpetrators were promoted , were transferred to other units without punishment , while victims were accused of lying or exaggerating their claims in order to ruin men 's reputations			0
" she called on @entity189 to grant " convening authority over criminal cases to trained , professional , disinterested prosecutors			0
commanding officers can not make truly impartial decisions because of their professional affiliation with the accused , and oftentimes with the victim as well			0
" she also called for civil courts to be opened to military victims			0
" @entity189 must ensure that men and women in uniform can access the remedies available to all other aggrieved individuals under the @entity278 and the @entity279			1
given the prevalence of retaliation against service members who report incidents of sexual assault and harassment , the absence of these remedies for military personnel is especially shameful			0
" " we are looking , " she said , " at an institution that desperately needs to be shown the next steps forward			0
