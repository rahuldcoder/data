-- the @entity1 will make history wednesday night			1
@entity5 , wearing a turban and beard , will take the stage and lead thousands of conservatives in prayer			1
for the first time in @entity9 history , a @entity10 @entity9 will give the invocation at a @entity1			1
the inclusion of a @entity10 prayer on the stage comes just a few weeks after a gunman opened fire on @entity10 praying in @entity19 , @entity20 , killing six and hospitalizing three more in what could be the largest racially motivated mass shooting in recent @entity9 history			1
many praise the invocation as a mark of progress in the @entity10 community 's 100 years in @entity9			1
and in a racially charged political climate , a turbaned and bearded man will be presented to the country by @entity31 as a fellow @entity9			1
this is a remarkable step forward			0
if @entity35 and @entity1 leaders want the historic @entity10 invocation to be more than tokenism -- and are serious about preventing another @entity19 -- they can not continue to let hateful speech within their own party go unchecked			1
in a time when hate groups are on the rise , the @entity31 must accept responsibility for fostering a political climate that often casts people of color as foreign and inherently suspect			1
@entity31 leaders have not only stood silent while fellow @entity31 fan the flames of anti-immigrant and @entity56 bias , they have given them the megaphone			2
@entity5 will speak on the same stage as sheriff @entity59 , infamous for shaming and rounding up undocumented immigrants , saying that it 's an honor to be compared to the @entity62			2
@entity63 , who is presiding over " @entity64 " at the @entity1 , has compared @entity65 to @entity66			2
@entity68 secretary of state @entity67 , also speaking at the convention , helped write a platform plank that includes supporting a ban on foreign law , which he admits targets the religious principles of @entity76			2
the plank , which copies @entity80 bills pushed by extreme conservative groups , is roundly condemned as a smoke - screen for @entity56 bigotry			0
@entity35 has not spoken out against it			0
@entity5 : my @entity10 prayer for the @entity1 similarly , when @entity9 rep. @entity88 , @entity89 , and four other members of @entity91 recently demanded the government investigate @entity9 @entity65 government employees and organizations for " infiltrating " and sabotaging the government , @entity35 and prominent @entity1 leaders remained silent			1
what 's worse , @entity35 , who could be our president , has played into the xenophobia himself , making statements that imply president @entity101 's skin color renders him foreign or suspect			2
on friday at a campaign stop , @entity35 said , " no one has ever asked to see my birth certificate			0
they know that this is the place that we were born and raised			0
" at a campaign stop in @entity110 , he said that @entity101 was trying to " change the nature of @entity9 " and that " his course is extraordinarily foreign			0
" in 2001 , in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks , hate crimes against @entity65 and those perceived to be @entity65 shot up by 1,600 %			0
to president @entity119 's credit , he publicly repeated that @entity65 were not our enemies			0
while prejudice and profiling became part of life for @entity65 and @entity10 , violent hate crimes fell by two - thirds in 2002 and stayed low -- until two years ago			1
in 2010 , @entity56 hate crimes jumped 50 %			0
nothing new happened to explain the increase , except this : fringe conservative groups pumped $ 42.6 million into think tanks to promote anti-islam ideologies and successfully manufactured a controversy around @entity136 , the so - called " ground zero mosque			0
" at the same time , politicians such as @entity88 , @entity9 rep. @entity138 and @entity63 pushed anti-muslim agendas by supporting @entity80 legislation			0
public voices have a responsibility for generating a climate of xenophobia , fear and hate			0
the @entity19 gunman , @entity147 , was a product of white supremacist hate groups , which have been on the rise in recent years			0
online hate groups have increased by 30 % in the past year alone			0
for gunmen like @entity147 , it seems to matter little whether their targets are @entity65 or @entity10 -- they harbor hate for anyone who does not look like them			1
to be sure , we should give the @entity31 some credit			2
in a time when many @entity10 have expressed disappointment that @entity101 has not yet come to visit the victims in @entity19 , most are grateful for the opportunity for a @entity10 prayer to be delivered on a national platform			1
but if that same party permits its politicians to spew hateful speech unchecked , then the gesture simply masks deeper trouble at the core of the @entity31			1
it was n't always this way			0
my @entity10 @entity9 father was a @entity1 , proud to belong to the party of @entity178 and @entity179			1
he raised my brother and me with lectures on the value of hard work , small government and independence			0
my own progressive politics in college made for colorful arguments at the @entity190 table			0
it was n't until the decade after 9/11 -- after witnessing firsthand how his party caved to fear - mongering , racial profiling and expansive federal power -- that he joined me in campaigning for candidate @entity101			0
my father is one of millions of brown and black @entity9 alienated by a @entity31 that has forgotten its own values			1
hearing that a @entity10 will pray on the stage of the @entity1 warmed my father 's heart			1
but it did n't make him forget			0
if the @entity31 wants to appeal to people like my father again , it must remember its own soul			1
@entity35 and @entity1 leaders must check extremism in speech			2
they can start by meditating on the @entity10 prayer to be offered by @entity5 : " @entity212 nam chardi kala , tere bhaanai sarbat da bhala			1
" calling upon @entity214 in the spirit of eternal optimism , the prayer asks for blessings not upon one party , community or even one country , but for sarbat dha bhalla -- all of humanity			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

@entity224 : @entity31 will make history when a @entity10 leads thousands in prayer at @entity1
@entity224 : if this is to be more than a gesture , @entity31 must speak out against hate
most @entity10 are *pleased* that a @entity10 prayer will be delivered on a national platform , she says
@entity224 's @entity10 father was with @entity31 but switched after he saw *discrimination* in party
