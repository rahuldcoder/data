-- the @entity1 is analyzing an audio recording that might give more clues about @entity5 's shooting			1
federal investigators have obtained the audio and are questioning the man who says he inadvertently recorded audio of gunfire at the time @entity5 was shot by @entity13 , @entity14 , police on august 9 , the man 's attorney told @entity0			1
it could be the newest piece in the larger puzzle of exactly what happened in the moments before the 18 - year - old 's death			0
the man , who wants to remain anonymous , was talking to someone on a video chat service and happened to record the conversation , his attorney @entity22 said			1
a quick series of shots can be heard on the recording , followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots			1
" at the time he did n't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building , " said @entity22			0
the man lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots , she said			1
forensic audio expert @entity44 analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six , followed by four			1
" i was very concerned about that pause ... because it 's not just the number of gunshots , it 's how they 're fired , " @entity22 told @entity0 's @entity48			1
" and that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up			0
" she said she learned of the recording late last week from a mutual friend			2
" i had to get his consent before i could reach out to the @entity1 , " @entity22 said			2
@entity0 can not independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the @entity1 for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording			1
the meaning of the pause it 's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports			0
attorney @entity75 said he was surprised by the gap in shots			0
" it 's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting , especially with an unarmed victim , because at this point mr. @entity5 is defenseless -- he has no weapon , " said @entity75 , who represented the family of @entity79			1
like @entity5 , @entity79 was an unarmed @entity87 - @entity86 man who was shot and killed by a white police officer			1
but if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the @entity5 incident , the pause does n't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer			1
" to be fair , there could be other explanations for that pause , " said attorney @entity95 , co-host of @entity0 's " @entity96			2
" " maybe the officer will say , ' well , i fired and he kept advancing , so i fired again			0
' " witnesses and a friend of officer @entity102 have given conflicting accounts of what led up to @entity5 's death			2
dueling narratives in @entity5 shooting @entity108 , who was walking with @entity5 at the time of the shooting , said the officer shot @entity5 once by the police car and again as he ran away			1
according to @entity108 , @entity5 was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting			2
but a woman who identified herself as a friend of @entity102 called in to a @entity117 radio show last week with what she said was the officer 's version of events			0
the caller , who identified herself only as " @entity123 , " said @entity5 taunted the officer and charged at him			2
her account matches what @entity102 has told investigators , a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told @entity0			0
an autopsy showed @entity5 had six gunshot wounds , all in the front of his body			0
will autopsy shed any light on what happened ? key witness speaks out @entity13 police said @entity5 allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting			2
and reports that his friend @entity108 had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put @entity108 's credibility in question			0
in 2011 , @entity108 was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name , age and address			0
@entity108 said monday night he does n't understand why some are questioning his credibility			0
" i see they bring up my past , my history , but it 's not like it 's a long rap sheet , " @entity108 told @entity48			0
" this one incident should n't make me a bad person			0
" @entity5 's funeral : @entity158 , tears and a call for social change complete coverage @entity0 's @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 contributed to this report .			1
