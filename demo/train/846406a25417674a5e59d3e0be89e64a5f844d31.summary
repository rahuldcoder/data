-- it 's a friday in may , 2005 , and @entity2 stands in the center of packed courtroom on the tropical island of @entity6 , waiting to learn her fate			1
will the beauty school student from @entity10 's @entity9 be found guilty of smuggling a large bag of marijuana into @entity13 -- where the maximum penalty for drug trafficking is death by firing squad ? a furrow forms between the 27 - year - old 's eyebrows as the judge reads out the verdict in @entity13			1
her piercing blue eyes dart around the room -- at her family , at the cameras broadcasting live to televisions around @entity10 , at the ground , at her interpreter			2
guilty -- the judge said			0
her sentence ? twenty years in a @entity6 prison			1
at the back of the court , members of her family erupt with anger			0
" it 's not alright ! how dare you ? " screams her sister , @entity44			0
" we swore on the @entity47 to tell the truth and your fellow lied ! " her mother , @entity50 , booms at the prosecutors			0
as her daughter is led away , @entity50 makes a promise : " @entity2 , you will come home			0
our government will bring you home			0
" not since @entity57 claimed a dingo took her baby in the @entity60 have @entity10 become so caught up in a courtroom drama			2
nearly nine years on from the verdict , interest remains strong enough to sustain a soon - to - be - broadcast @entity10 telemovie based on the case			1
and now @entity23 has walked out of prison -- on parole but free			1
yet @entity10 remains divided as to whether she is guilty of the crime			2
to this day , @entity23 insists she was an unwitting victim of a botched drug smuggling operation			1
the bust on 8 october 2004 , @entity23 took a flight with her brother and two friends from @entity78 airport via @entity79 to @entity6 to celebrate @entity44 ' 30th birthday			1
when they landed in @entity13 , customs officials checked their luggage and discovered a plastic bag containing 4.1 kilograms of marijuana -- the largest seizure ever made at @entity6 's @entity87 airport -- in @entity23 's boogie board bag			1
she said she had no idea how the drugs ended up in her luggage			0
she had n't locked the bag carrying her board so the marijuana must have been planted there , she argued			0
@entity97 authorities had a different version of events			0
customs officers who were at the airport claimed @entity23 refused to open the bag when asked -- a claim she denies			1
they also said she admitted the marijuana was hers			0
@entity23 says they had difficulty understanding each other , and that she told them the bag , not the drugs , belonged to her			2
there was no @entity115 footage of the inspection			0
@entity23 was arrested and charged with breaching @entity13 's tough anti-drug trafficking laws			1
she was put in jail without bail pending trial			0
her story resonated with many @entity10 -- those who had been to @entity6 , a popular tourist destination ; those who imagined how easily an unlocked bag could allow drug traffickers to turn a dream holiday into a nightmare ; those who held prejudices about customs officials in developing countries ; and others who thought , regardless of whether @entity23 was guilty or not , the penalty she faced was unreasonably harsh			1
when @entity23 was sentenced , @entity10 's then - prime minister @entity135 said he understood why @entity10 felt so strongly about her case			1
" the fact that we are a nation whose young travel so much , it is an issue that has touched this country very directly , " he said			0
actor @entity146 was an example of a high profile voice on the case			0
" when there is such doubt , how can we as a country stand by and let a young lady , as an @entity10 , rot away in a foreign prison ? that is ridiculous , " he said in an interview with @entity79 radio station @entity157			1
a fair go ? much of the outrage surrounding @entity23 's case centered on whether she had been treated fairly			1
under @entity97 law , @entity23 had to prove that someone else had placed the drugs in her bag			2
@entity97 customs officials at the airport did not weigh her luggage			2
in @entity10 , @entity23 's baggage was weighed together with those of her travel companions , not as separate pieces			1
@entity23 's defense team asked for fingerprint testing to be carried out on the plastic bag containing the drugs			2
their requests were repeatedly denied			0
her lawyers claimed that the drugs were planted in @entity78 , by airline baggage handlers involved in interstate drug trafficking , who planned to remove the package in @entity79 , but mistakenly sent it to @entity6 instead			1
the judges in @entity23 's trial found her defense team could not prove there was another person responsible for the drugs			2
as chief judge @entity192 read out the court 's verdict , he said @entity23 had " convincingly carried out a crime " by importing the drugs illegally			1
" the actions of the accused were a danger to the community , " he said			0
" this was a transnational crime that could damage the minds of young people			0
" is she guilty ? as far as many were concerned , @entity23 was your average young , attractive @entity10			1
an opinion poll among @entity10 after she was charged found that more than 90 % believed she was innocent			2
@entity23 , whose father was a coal miner and mother a fish and chip shop owner , had no previous criminal convictions and no evidence of involvement with drugs in the past			2
in an interview with @entity10 public broadcaster @entity220 , @entity23 's father , @entity218 , said she did n't use drugs , except for possibly experimenting in high school			1
" oh , she might have bloody had a puff when she was in bloody @entity226 or something , round the back of the schoolyard like kids do , i do n't know , " he said			0
@entity23 's lawyers relied on a witness -- a prisoner awaiting trial in @entity235 -- who said he overheard other inmates talking about a drug smuggling syndicate that had " lost " a package of marijuana after planting it in luggage at @entity78 airport in october 2004			1
@entity10 media told the stories of other tourists who said they 'd found marijuana in their luggage on arrival in @entity6 years earlier			1
one man told @entity249 , he found a bag of pot about the size of a loaf of bread in his luggage			0
the man said when he phoned the @entity10 consulate in @entity13 , they told him " you get caught with that , mate , and you 'll be eating nasi goreng for the rest of your life in jail			2
" a spokeswoman for the department confirmed that call to a @entity79 paper			0
then , just weeks before @entity23 's trial ended , @entity271 and @entity272 , the airline @entity23 used to fly to @entity6 , announced they had been investigating the role of some baggage handlers in a long running cocaine smuggling operation through @entity79 airport			1
one alleged incident took place on the same day @entity23 traveled			0
@entity23 's defense said they were hopeful of using the evidence in an appeal			2
however , @entity272 said thorough reviews with police found no evidence of links between @entity23 's case and the alleged cocaine trafficking			1
over the years , questions have been raised about @entity23 's father			1
a family member accused him of involvement in drug dealing			0
a book went even further			0
but @entity23 's father , who died of cancer in 2008 , steadfastly denied any involvement with drugs			2
for a case under the microscope , no detail -- even involving a family member , is too small			0
questions over the integrity of some of @entity23 's legal team also threatened to damage her case			1
when allegations emerged that one of @entity23 's legal advisers requested a $ 500,000 from the @entity10 government in an attempt to bribe @entity97 judges , her flamboyant lawyer , @entity316 , appeared on an @entity220 current affairs program " the 7.30 report " to defend himself -- raising other questions in the process			1
" so i 'm not mr @entity321 , but for this case temporarily i am clean , " he said			0
" there is no lawyer in the world is clean ( sic ) ... if you keep saying @entity10 lawyer , @entity328 lawyer they are all clean , that 's totally bulls -- t. " what happens now ? on monday , @entity23 was released on parole amid a swarm of cameras			1
but she wo n't be returning to @entity10 anytime soon			0
@entity23 , now 36 , must remain in @entity13 on parole until 2017 , according to local media reports			0
it 's believed she will live with her sister @entity44 , who has a home in @entity342 -- a popular tourist area in @entity6			2
according to @entity0 's @entity10 affiliate @entity344 , @entity23 plans to work in a surf shop owned by @entity44 ' husband , where she will design bikinis			1
it seems the @entity23 saga is n't over just yet			0
@entity0 's @entity351 contributed to this report .			0
