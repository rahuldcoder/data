-- whatever other resolutions we make leading up to the @entity3 -- to call @entity4 more often , lay off the late - night snacks -- getting ourselves organized is likely near the top of the list			1
and that often means clearing out the clutter that keeps us from functioning efficiently , whether we 're at work or at home			1
many employees -- whether they go to actual offices or do their jobs from home -- find the last week of the calendar year is ideal for sorting through e-mails , clearing their desks , and reorganizing their work spaces			1
sorting through stuff is rarely fun , but those who tackle it now will find themselves a step ahead when their now - vacationing colleagues and clients come staggering back after the holidays			1

at work , we strive to project that we 're knowledgeable , in control and experts			1

know yourself , and come up with solutions that reflect who you are , she says			0
after all , she says , " ' it 's here somewhere ' is the most frustrating phrase in the @entity152 language			2
