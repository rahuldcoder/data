the controversy over @entity0 's time goes back to the 1973 race day			2
@entity0 's 1973 @entity8 time reviewed the electronic timer at the @entity8 recorded a winning time of 1:55 ( one minute , 55 seconds )			1
however , two independent clockers from the @entity30 individually timed the race at 1:53 2/5			2
officials at the @entity33 in @entity34 , where the race is held , admitted that there were " extenuating circumstances " with the electronic timer 's recording and changed @entity0 's official time to 1:54 2/5			1
if @entity0 had indeed run the 1 3/16 - mile ( 9.5 - furlong ) race in 1:53 2/5 , as the @entity30 timed it , it would have meant a record at the time , and one that has been matched but not beaten since			1
