-- in the painkiller world , oxycodone and naloxone seem like strange bedfellows			2
@entity5 is a powerful painkiller , while naloxone is used to reverse painkiller overdose			2
on wednesday , the @entity8 approved a drug combining the two , called @entity11 the drug 's maker , @entity12 , said the combination is intended to " alleviate pain while also introducing a new method by which to help deter misuse and abuse			1
" @entity5 is one in a group of powerful painkillers -- called opioid analgesics -- that include hydrocodone , morphine and hydromorphone			2
it provides pain relief by binding to receptors in the brain that dull the sensation of pain			1
so why marry it with naloxone ? simply put , naloxone can unseat oxycodone on those same brain receptors , blocking its ability to provide pain relief			1
in the case of @entity11 , it happens only when the pill is crushed			2
if the pill remains intact , naloxone lies dormant , allowing oxycodone to do its work			0
approval of an abuse - deterrent painkiller such as @entity11 would seem welcome , considering the rampant use of the drugs in the @entity48			0
the @entity48 consumes 83 % of the world 's oxycodone and 99 % of its hydrocodone , according to a 2010 @entity53 report			0
forty - six people die each day from prescription painkiller overdoses , according to the @entity56			0
dr. @entity57 , an emergency room physician who sees opioid overdoses on a weekly basis , said @entity11 limits the common abuse delivery routes -- such as crushing , dissolving and injecting pills , or crushing and snorting them			0
" well done to the manufacturer for placing some built - in pharmacological protections , " said @entity57 , past president of the @entity64 chapter of the @entity65 , in an e-mail			0
" it wo n't stop orally ingested overdose deaths , but will limit some of its ' street marketability			0
' " and abuse - deterrence seemed to work with another of @entity12 's painkillers , oxycontin : a difficult - to - crush version of the drug was introduced in 2010			1
" before that , @entity5 was the most commonly diverted and abused drug , " said @entity79 , an opioid overdose researcher and former senior science adviser to the @entity82			1
" after the formulation changed , nobody liked it because they could n't abuse it			0
" according to the @entity90 , before 2010 , @entity5 had been considered a primary drug of abuse for about 36 % of people surveyed			1
twenty - one months after the introduction of the abuse - deterrence version , only 13 % abused it			1
what impact @entity11 's approval could have on oxycodone abuse remains to be seen			0
@entity11 's approval " will better enable the @entity8 to balance addressing this problem with meeting the needs of the millions of people in this country suffering from pain , " said dr. @entity100 , deputy director of the @entity8 's @entity101 , in a statement			1
the @entity8 said the drug should be prescribed as a last resort , for patients who have exhausted all other attempts to relieve their pain			1
still , experts on addiction said they fear that @entity11 could still be easily abused			1
" @entity119 is only active if injected or squirted up the nose , " said @entity115 , chief medical officer of the @entity116 , an alcohol and drug abuse treatment provider			1
" that means a patient who chews @entity11 will get the entire dose all at once and the naloxone will have no effect			0
" when the pills are swallowed , they are as addictive and dangerous as pure oxycodone			0
" the concern is that people who abuse or misuse opioids ( also called opiates ) will simply find another route to a high			2
" in a sense it 's playing a game of whack - a - mole , because if people are addicted to opiates , they will find an opiate , " said @entity79 , who 's a senior research scientist at the @entity134 's @entity135			0
" this ( drug approval ) could and will likely help , but it does n't fix the inherent problem that people addicted to opiates will continue to use them			2
" @entity8 aims to tighten control of hydrocodone @entity8 fights drug overdoses with new labels			1

drug relieves pain while at the same time deterring misuse
experts on addiction say they fear @entity163 could still be easily abused
