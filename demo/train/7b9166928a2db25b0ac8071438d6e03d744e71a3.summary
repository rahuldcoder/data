after the country failed to qualify for the @entity4 due to misinterpreting the tournament 's rules			1
@entity7 celebrated on saturday believing a 0 - 0 draw at home to @entity10 in @entity11 had secured them top spot in qualification @entity14 due to their superior goal difference over their opponents and rivals @entity19			1
but it emerged @entity19 would advance to next year 's tournament in @entity22 and @entity23 as a result of their superior head - to - head record against @entity7 and @entity10 , despite suffering a 3 - 0 defeat to bottom side @entity29 in @entity30			1
" we have noted that @entity2 has announced that @entity19 has qualified in our group , " read a letter sent by @entity1 to @entity2			1
" despite @entity7 finishing on top of the group in terms of goal difference , which is the universally recognized means of separating teams who are equal on points			1
big names miss out on @entity4 " we believe that the team finishing top of the log at the end of the competition is automatically determined at the end of 90 minutes play , and that the second place is determined by the other rules			2
" we will lay out our objection more fully shortly , but in the meantime wish to signal that we intend to challenge this interpretation and application of the rules			0
" @entity1 president @entity56 was defiant after the match , insisting the organization would challenge a lack of clarity in the tournament 's rules			0
" do not despair , all is not lost , " said @entity56			0
" we believe we have a case and we will carry this fight all the way			0
" if @entity2 's rules are ambiguous then we need to challenge that and we are well within our rights to do so			0
in the meantime be positive , and leave everything in our hands			0
" @entity7 hosted football 's biggest tournament last year when they became the first @entity77 country to stage a @entity78 , but the team known as @entity7 have now failed to reach two consecutive @entity80			2
it also proved to be a shocking qualifying campaign for @entity29 , with the @entity83 missing out on next year 's event having won the last three tournaments in a row			2
@entity29 , the most successful team in the history of the @entity80 having won it seven times , recently appointed former @entity91 coach @entity90 in an attempt to reverse their current fortunes			0
two - time winners @entity96 have also missed out on the 2012 competition after @entity23 scored a late equalizer in a 2 - 2 draw on saturday , to book their place in next year 's tournament at the expense of the @entity96 .			1
