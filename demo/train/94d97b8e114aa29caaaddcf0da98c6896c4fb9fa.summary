" we wanted something that expressed our culture of openness , " said @entity7 , @entity8 , lt. @entity9 , the department 's public information officer			1
" it 's not that we take our jobs lightly , it 's that we tend to approach every situation with a positive attitude			2

" it 's been a smash on @entity31			2
running a little more than six minutes , the video comprises sketch routines featuring officers on the 120 - member force			1
" this is our dispatcher , @entity39 , " an officer says cheerfully in one sequence			0
" she 's fantastic ; you can reach her at 911			0
" all the officers , except one acting " cool , " are from the department			1
the two bad guys are professional actors			0
the video was shot over three days in early july and cost about $ 9,200			1
@entity9 said the money came from the city 's marketing budget			0
" it 's public money , and when we look at the return on this $ 9,000 we spent , the fact is that a lot of folks are paying attention , " he said			1
" i 'm also very sensitive to the public 's trust about the money , but the feedback from the people in our city has been very positive			0
" @entity7 may be looking for an image makeover as well			0
the previous police chief resigned in march amid labor tensions , according to the @entity68 newspaper			1
in addition , a former commander filed a hostile work environment action against the interim police chief , who left in june , the newspaper said			1
@entity9 said the environment has greatly improved			0
" the issues internally have never been issues externally ; they 've never manifested themselves out in the field , and that 's where the rubber meets the road for us , " he said			0
will the video be a hit or miss ? will it start a trend for first - responders looking for applicants ? @entity88 , a social media consultant for police departments , thought @entity7 did the right thing			1
" this video in my opinion was ( and ) is a risk , " @entity88 said			1
" but i think in the long run , it 's going to be a big win for both their reputation and their selection options for the next chief			1
" she also praised the department for being a trendsetter			0
" @entity7 is pushing that envelope and so they 're going to be criticized			0
all pioneers have to take a few arrows in the back right ? " she said			0
" they say they 're not an uptight department and , i would say they 're proving it ! " the video 's director echoed the sentiment , calling it a " fantastic " way to get the word out			2
" it was awesome that they wanted to do something like this , " said @entity118			2
" we think outside of the box			0
i look at this as a great opportunity to get a positive message out there about the police			2
" @entity9 said he has seen criticism of the video in web comments after articles about it , but he stands by the department 's decision			2
" if they could meet our folks , they could understand what we are trying to get across , " he said			0
" the whole thing is to connect with people and make good things happen			0
