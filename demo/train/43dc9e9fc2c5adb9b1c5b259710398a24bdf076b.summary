@entity0 -- an @entity3 official saturday dismissed as " strange " @entity5 's actions , including its decision to expel @entity3 's ambassador , offering seemingly unwavering remarks on the same day a top @entity5 official threatened to soon bring @entity3 before the @entity10			1
deputy foreign minister @entity11 told @entity1 affiliate @entity12 that " the entire fashion in which the @entity5 have acted is strange			1
" " @entity3 must not subject its foreign policy to caprices of others , " he added			2
" the lack of cooperation does not hurt us alone , it damages the @entity5 as well			2
" meanwhile , @entity5 foreign minister @entity21 told state - run news outlet @entity23 on saturday that his nation will soon bring its case against @entity3 to the @entity10			1
" the @entity10 is binding , " @entity21 said			0
" so we say , if you think this way , let the @entity10 decide			0
we will initiate the legal procedure next week			0
" the one - time close allies have been at odds since may 2010 , when @entity3 troops boarded a ship headed to the @entity34 territory of @entity35 -- around which @entity3 has a naval blockade			1
the @entity37 had numerous @entity5 aboard and was part of a flotilla loaded with humanitarian aid			2
nine people were killed in the subsequent confrontation , and several @entity3 troops were injured			0
in the latest indication of escalating tension between the two nations , @entity5 officials on friday ordered @entity3 's ambassador and other senior diplomats to leave their nation			1
foreign minister @entity21 said military agreements also have been suspended			1
but a senior @entity5 official said that existing contracts must be honored " no matter what " and " we have n't touched upon intelligence sharing			0
" besides the flotilla raid incident , @entity5 has strongly opposed the jewish state 's blockade of @entity35 because , an official said , @entity34 have suffered from the action and other @entity3 policies in the densely populated region			1
" it is about time for the @entity3 government to face the consequences of its illegitimate actions since it sees itself above international law and ignores human conscience and must pay a price , " @entity21 said			0
" this price will be , above all , the loss of @entity5 's friendship			2
" the ouster of @entity3 diplomats from @entity5 was cheered saturday by @entity77 's foreign ministry			1
in a statement , reported by the semiofficial @entity80 , the ministry hailed the expulsion and called for more international constraints on @entity3 's authority in the region , particularly as it pertains to @entity35			1
@entity11 , in his comments saturday , accused @entity5 of trying to " rise to unreasonable highs " in its demands for an apology on the incident and changes in @entity3 's policy			1
also friday , the @entity94 released the so - called @entity96 report about the may 2010 raid in which it criticized @entity3 's actions in the incident , even as it defended the blockade of @entity35 as a " legitimate security measure			1
" @entity3 's blockade of @entity35 is designed to prevent weapons from being smuggled to the territory , which is controlled by the @entity106 group @entity105			1
@entity35 - based militants have been firing rockets into southern @entity3 and @entity3 has responded with military might			1
@entity34 prime minister @entity110 voiced " deep concern " about the report 's conclusion on the blockade , according to a statement from his office reported by the @entity114 's official news agency @entity113			1
" the fact that it considers the @entity3 blockade on the @entity35 legal is appalling and encourages @entity3 to continue to violate the rights of our @entity34 people , " @entity110 said , urging the @entity94 and others in the " international community ( to ) take all necessary measures to end this unjust blockade			1
" @entity11 , in contrast , applauded the @entity94 report and said it validated @entity3 's actions -- including its refusal to apologize for the incident			1
" the report proves there was no point in apologizing , " he said			0
" it would have led us into a slippery slope in which every factor in the region would have demanded @entity3 for an apology			2
" @entity5 and @entity3 have been negotiating for months in an attempt to improve their faltering relationship , but those efforts have failed			2
the release of the report was delayed while those negotiations continued			0
" we 've waited and waited , " the senior @entity5 official told @entity1			0
" there was almost an agreement that @entity155 agreed upon ... they 're just wasting our time			0
" he was referring to @entity3 prime minister @entity155			2
" this makes it official			0
before it was de facto , there was nothing going on , but definitely there was contact , " said the official , who asked not to be named because of diplomatic protocol			0
among other statements , @entity5 signaled that it aimed to increase its presence in the region -- though @entity172 , a former chief of staff for the @entity173 , said one should n't presume the @entity5 navy may now clash with their @entity3 counterparts			2
@entity172 added that savvy diplomacy may be needed to remedy the situation , saying both sides need to find a way " to climb down " from the escalating heights			0
" the word apology is very heavy , diplomats must find a way to find the right words to use , " he said			0
" an apology is too late and would not be useful			0
" @entity1 's @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .			0
