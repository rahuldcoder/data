-- the summit of the @entity2 looms large over the @entity4 ski resort of @entity5 , more than 1,700 meters above sea level			1
a myriad of ski slopes meander down the mountain in winter , the most famous of which is the notorious " @entity11			0
" translated as " streak , " it is the ultimate in downhill courses , and the @entity15 race it hosts every january is often run in ludicrously treacherous conditions			1
watched by celebrities , such as @entity18 and @entity20 's jet set , it is often referred to as " the @entity21 of skiing			1
" the winner each year attains virtually legendary status within the skiing community , while its famous sections such as the @entity27 and @entity28 -- taken at speeds of about 90 mph -- have become bywords in the @entity4 lexicon			1
at the start gate , insignias bearing the names of its most illustrious sons and daughters take pride of place : @entity39 , who won the prestigious downhill four times ; @entity42 , a three - time winner ; and , most recently , @entity44 , a 42 - year - old @entity46 farmer with a germanic name			1
@entity44 's wins on the @entity49 , though , have come in very different fashion -- and indeed a month after the main event -- as he switches skis for spikes and tackles the course uphill rather than down			1
as maverick events go , @entity55 is right up there			0
the night race , now in its fourth year , features multinational competitors from across @entity20 -- some choosing cross-country skis and poles -- testing their mettle in subzero temperatures			1
from the chalets in the valley below , it looks like an eerie blur of lights as the runners in their head torches disappear up the slopes at varying degrees of speed			0
the goal is simple -- the first one to the top wins			0
that has tended to be @entity44 , who holds the course record of 32 minutes			0
the climb , parts of which are virtually vertical , is 3,312 meters in distance with an uphill in total of 860m			1
by day , @entity44 gets up at 6 a.m. to deal with the cattle on his farm			0
by night it appears he likes nothing more than careering up a mountainside ... at speed			0
but why exactly ? " everyone thinks of the @entity49 in the sense of downhill racing -- the @entity55 offers an absolutely new possibility of becoming a @entity49 conqueror with the bottom - up method , " he tells @entity0			1
" plus i 'm now honored by an insignia at the top of the next to the great names like @entity39			0
" so determined is he to exercise when his working day is done -- @entity44 competes in summer mountain races , likes to cycle and run with his dog , and even his holidays are spent traveling to races -- that he admits : " i have no idea of boredom			0
" the first event came into being by word of mouth and , continuing in that same vein , it has become more and more popular			1
a relatively modest crowd gathers at the bottom but , the whole way up it , crowds hug the advertising hoardings			0
" you can feel the enthusiasm and that 's very motivating to push myself forward and give the best in order to reach the finish in a good time , " @entity44 says			1
" in every race , you get yourself to the limit , sometimes even further			1
and in the race i am totally by myself			1
after the start , i ca n't see or hear anything			0
i am just totally focused on my aims			0
" the victory is just the reward for all the struggle and the acknowledgment for all the deprivation , which you have to accomplish in sport			0
" the motto for the @entity138 downhill is that the best form of defense is attack , and it is something @entity44 adheres to , although the rest of the competitors , who vary massively in their standard , are not always so gung - ho			1
among them is former cyclist @entity146 , an @entity147 competitor and a two - time @entity149 winner in his heyday			1
in the @entity55 , he does not aspire to victory , although he boasts a top - 10 finish in his three outings to date			2
his inspiration to tackle the slopes came from seeing @entity4 skiing great @entity156 enter the prologue of the @entity159 , a race in which @entity146 also took part			2
he had thought of being one of the skiers who help prepare the @entity11 for the @entity15 event but , perhaps rightly , he decided it was too dangerous so opted for uphill instead			1
" this is a challenge but more than that it 's fun with friends , " says @entity146			2
" it 's not a goal to win but i want to do my best			2
it 's not like i 'll be disappointed in 17th or 39th or whatever			2
" this is about good times on a route which downhillers have come down a few weeks before ... fast			0
" but it is not all fun for the competitors			2
" when you get to the end , it 's just a relief , " @entity146 admits			2
" there 's a 100 - meter vertical climb at one point during which it feels like your chest is up at your throat			1
it 's hard but then you finish , you get a warm drink and it 's joy			2
" for an athlete who has tackled the @entity149 's toughest cycling ascents , @entity146 is more naturally prepared than other entrants			2
" running up hills is quite normal for me , " adds the 38 - year - old			1
" it 's hard to compare pushing in the pedal with running uphill but it 's something that suits me			2
" but it 's totally different to the @entity149			2
it 's not like anything else , running up ice in spikes			2
it 's -10 degrees but a short - sleeve t - shirt could be fine as you get warm really fast			1
" @entity208 competitor @entity207 , a 26 - year - old with a best vertical up time of 46 minutes , has been a resident in @entity5 since 2005 , working as a skiing instructor and also to become a fitness trainer			1
at last year 's race , he said his heart rate was an average 190 beats per minute -- the normal resting rate is 60 - 100			1
like @entity44 and @entity146 , he has competed in every @entity216 , and admits to slight nerves beforehand			0
" it gets steep immediately and there 's only a tiny bit of respite the whole way , " @entity207 says			0
" at the end , it 's like you 're trying to run but you just ca n't , and there 's a horrible burning in your legs			0
it feels like at any second you 're going to turn to jelly but then the finish comes			0
" some collapse , some are sick , some are relieved and some are joyous , you feel like you have nothing left			0
" i watched @entity44 's winning race and that 's just insane			1
we all think the downhill guys are nuts , and i guess we 're nuts in a different way			0
this is simply not comparable to anything in the world			0
it 's like a crazy gathering			0
" a crazy gathering where the only way is up .			0
