it has been described as @entity2 on snow			2
twelve horses line up in a start gate but the race is far from conventional			1
the race track is a snow - covered frozen lake and attached to each horse is a skier			2
it is akin to human chariot racing as riders hit speeds of 50km/h jostling for position and , ultimately , victory			1
the sport of skijoring has a long and rich history			1
and @entity21 and the @entity23 ski resort of @entity24 have been a part of the @entity27 event for over three decades			1
with its often combative nature , it is no wonder @entity32 likens the sport to the 1959 film starring @entity35			1
" skijoring is just something that people want to see , " he says			1
" it 's like @entity2 on snow , the modern way			2
i love the speed , the adrenalin rush is something special			0
" skijoring comes from the @entity49 word skikj√∏ring , which literally translates as ski driving , and is thought to date back to the 14th century			1
in @entity24 , the sport began in 1906 and was even a display sport at the @entity53			1
when it first began , participants set off at one - minute intervals over a 10 - kilometer stretch			0
but after it was switched to a makeshift racecourse , the race now consists of two laps covering a distance of 2,700 meters			0
there is no doubting the precarious nature of the sport			1
at one notorious race in 1965 , not a single entrant finished			0
and at the last race , during the notoriously challenging start where jockeys aim to avoid getting their ropes tangled , @entity21 says : " one jockey crashed his head and lost a few minutes with a loss of consciousness			1
" some 10,000 people flock to each race in the @entity77 , creating a party atmosphere for the only three events of the year held each february			0
the overall victor is crowned " @entity81 , " so called after the valley where the racing takes place			1
@entity21 , who has been skijoring for 31 years and has no qualms about nudging horses out of his in a bid for on - track supremacy , was crowned king on sunday			1
the 55 - year - old could only finish fifth in the third and final race of the three - week series , but two previous wins towed by the horse @entity95 proved sufficient for another title			0
his family ran a horse - carriage business , so skijoring allies one passion with another			1
his day job is as the director of @entity104			0
and having stumbled on the sport in the first place , he says : " skijoring is something you ca n't forget			1
maybe we 're a little bit crazy , i do n't know			0
" there are obvious dangers to the sport , not least wrestling with reins and ropes in a melee of horses and drivers at the start			1
" you get very close to the other horses , it 's like a sandwich and it 's a bit dangerous , " he explained			2
" you have horses in front and behind and the danger is someone can stand on your ski			2
" amazingly , though , @entity32 has never had a major accident in his time in the sport and is pleased to point out there have been no deaths during his era			2
although there have been a litany of injuries to others , " nothing too bad , broken arms and legs , " he adds matter - of - factly			0
it 's not just in @entity23 where skijoring has taken hold , variations of the sport can entail people being driven by dogs or even motor vehicles			1
in the @entity158 , it generally involves jockeyed horses pulling skiers along by a rope -- catching hoops and tackling jumps along the course			1
for @entity166 , president of the @entity168 @entity167 , which hosts its own @entity169 at the end of january each year in front of 4,000 spectators , the sport almost cost him his life			1
@entity166 does not ski -- he rides the horses instead -- but became precariously unstuck while training for one particular competition			1
" i was running my horse through ice and snow when it broke through the ground and half a ton of horse came down on me , " he recalled			0
" it all happened in slow motion			0
" i heard my neck break , i heard it crack like a gun going off			2
" with his head planted , he could n't move			0
he was trapped in the snow , with just enough room to breathe in a gap under his chin			0
he had broken the @entity195 and @entity196 vertebrae in his neck and was now alone as his horse headed back to the barn			2
" i was getting very anxious that this was where i was going to die , " he said			0
but eventually he regained sufficient movement in his arm to telephone for help and was in an ambulance 20 minutes later			0
two hours later he was moving his toes and , defying the doctors , he was walking within two days			0
" the doctor said one tenth of 1 % of people that have that injury live and one tenth of that number walk again			0
" despite the horrific nature of his injuries four years ago he returned to skijoring only to fall again and break eight ribs leading to a longer hiatus from the sport , which ended two years ago			1
for him , it is a drug he just can not give up : " it 's a lot of fun , it 's a kick			0
i do n't think there 's any sport to compare to it			2
it 's an unusual combination of old cowboys and skiers getting together to make a big run			0
when i compete , the adrenalin is just unbelievable			0
" as for the wider appeal , he jokes : " the silly story is that some guys got together to have a combination of who the best horseman is , the best skier and the best drinker , and this combines all three ! " so what exactly makes a good skijoring competitor ? @entity21 , who like his fellow riders has to take an exam in order to be eligible to compete , explains : " first it is experience , and knowing what can happen in a race so you can react when something goes wrong			1
" you have to be a very good skier and you have to have the feeling of the horse			0
you need to be a team			0
often these are horses you do n't know so they need to get an immediate confidence from you			2
" edging into his 2015 season finale , @entity32 continues to master that triumvirate in what is perhaps the purest form of horsepower .			2

skijoring is akin to human chariot racing as horses tow racers on skis behind them
@entity21 has become the master of the sport in @entity24 , a historic *hub* for skijoring
@entity166 nearly lost his life competing in the @entity158 after breaking his neck
