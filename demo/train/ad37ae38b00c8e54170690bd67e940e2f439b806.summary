-- as the @entity4 continues limited , targeted airstrikes for the third day in @entity6 , political divisions around the scope of @entity4 involvement are emerging in @entity7			1
top - ranking @entity8 who appeared on political talk shows sunday advocated for a limited mission and insisted that the @entity6 government must respond to the growing threat of the extreme militant group @entity14 , which calls itself the @entity15 but formerly was known as the @entity15 in @entity6 and @entity16			1
republicans , meanwhile , are advocating a far more aggressive stance , insisting that @entity14 poses a direct threat to the @entity4 they urged president @entity20 to do more than the limited airstrikes he announced friday			1
@entity14 , which obtained sustained power in parts of @entity16 , has expanded its deadly grip on parts of @entity6 , especially the @entity27 north , where tens of thousands of @entity29 minorities had been forced into mountains , where they 're stranded without food and water			1
up to 60 children are among those who have died from the extreme conditions			0
thousands of @entity29 rescued , @entity37 spokesman says dehydration or massacre : thousands caught in @entity14 chokehold the militant group executes civilians who do n't adhere to its version of @entity45			0
its goal is to create an @entity48 caliphate , which it claims it has already done , calling the regions they control in @entity6 and @entity16 the @entity15			1
@entity20 announced airstrikes to protect the hundreds of @entity4 working in the region and said humanitarian assistance to @entity27 minorities would be part of a limited mission that he described as a " long - term project			1
" but in @entity7 , @entity17 harshly criticized the president and his mission , saying it is too little , too late			1
the @entity4 role " @entity14 continues to make gains everywhere , " @entity64 sen. @entity64 said sunday on @entity0 's " @entity65			1
" @entity20 's approach to protect military and diplomatic personnel in the area , @entity64 said , is " narrow " in scope and " clearly very , very ineffective , to say the least			0
" " that 's not a strategy , " he said , calling for additional airstrikes in @entity6 and @entity16 to dismantle @entity14 and to provide additional military equipment to the @entity27 and the @entity16 fighters who oppose @entity14			1
officials : @entity4 airstrikes pound @entity14 militants firing at @entity6 's @entity29 that sentiment for an expanded involvement was echoed by rep. @entity81 , @entity83 - @entity82			1
" i am saying we should do whatever we have to do , " the @entity85 member said on @entity87 's " @entity86 , " including , " we take nothing off the table			0
" on sunday , @entity8 , however , expressed support for the president 's targeted airstrikes and cautioned against any broader involvement			0
" escalating it is not on the cards , " sen. @entity95 , @entity96 , said on " @entity86			0
" " we can not send the troops			0
we must not send the troops			0
" but @entity81 insisted his support for a broader operation , which includes " massive aircraft , " does not involve @entity4 combat troops back into the country after nearly a decade of war and three years after the troops left			2
" let 's not set up the false argument that there have to be troops on the ground , " he said			0
the role of @entity6 @entity8 said sunday that the @entity4 can do little beyond provide humanitarian assistance and protect @entity4 personnel			1
they said it is ultimately up to @entity6 to address the crisis engulfing their country			2
" only @entity6 can save @entity6 , " @entity95 said			2
" if @entity6 come together , @entity121 put in power someone in power with the @entity124 and @entity27 , perhaps they can do it themselves			2
" the @entity4 relationship with prime minister @entity121 has deteriorated			2
he has been blamed for escalating tensions between religious and ethnic sects within @entity6 between the @entity124 majority , the @entity45 minority , the @entity27 and smaller groups of minorities , causing the destabilization of the country			2
the @entity6 @entity135 is expected to choose a new prime minister soon , and @entity8 say that the new leader should unite the shattered country			2
@entity8 say that political reconciliation in @entity140 would be able to address the crisis , which sen. @entity142 , @entity143 , called a " civil war			0
" " the real cause is that the @entity6 government has not performed the way it should to protect the rights of all @entity6 , " @entity142 said on " @entity145			2
" sen. @entity150 , @entity151 , a member of the @entity152 , agreed that the @entity4 is not responsible for repairing a country fraught with political divisions			1
" this has to be a political strategy that takes place in @entity140 and not in @entity7 , " he said on @entity158 ' " @entity157			1
" but @entity81 lambasted the @entity8 , saying they are providing a limited view of @entity6 and the threat of @entity14			1
he insisted that the problem is much deeper than @entity163 turmoil			0
threat to the @entity4 he called the @entity8 ' position , which is similar to the one @entity20 expressed this past week , a " shameful abdication of @entity4 leadership			0
" @entity81 said @entity14 is a threat beyond @entity6 and @entity16 , calling the group more powerful than @entity170 was on september 11 , 2001 , when the @entity4 was attacked			1
" i want to hear what he says when they attack us in the @entity4 , " @entity81 said of @entity14			0
sen. @entity175 , @entity177 - @entity176 , offered a similar , dire sentiment of the threat from the militant group shunned by @entity170 because of its extreme , violent tactics			0
" i think of an @entity4 city in flames because of the terrorist ability to operate in @entity16 and @entity6 , " he said on " @entity145			1
" " whatever you want to call these guys , they are coming here			0
" @entity188 spiraling in war and terror @entity0 's @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 contributed to this report .			0
