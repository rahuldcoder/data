-- the silverware keeps coming for @entity2			2
when @entity2 defeated outsider @entity5 2 - 0 in the final of @entity8 's @entity7 in @entity9 on saturday , it collected a fifth trophy this year			1
@entity2 won the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 last season under @entity15 , with the @entity16 and now @entity7 coming with @entity17 at the helm			1
@entity2 's lone blip was losing the @entity20 to @entity21 in july			2
@entity5 failed in its bid to become the first @entity24 side to win the competition , although the @entity27 champion did well to reach the finale after upsetting @entity30 's @entity29			1
@entity2 was hardly threatened , even without the likes of @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 in the starting lineup , and scored twice within 25 minutes to end any hopes of a shock upset			0
@entity41 defender @entity40 put @entity2 ahead in the seventh minute when he was unmarked in the penalty area and @entity5 keeper @entity43 made two good saves before @entity46 's strike in the 22nd doubled the score			1
and only a minor miracle , it seems , can stop @entity2 from repeating as @entity52 champion after its main rivals stumbled saturday			1
@entity54 lost its second straight league game , 1 - 0 at @entity56 , while @entity21 -- @entity2 's victim in the @entity12 final -- fell 2 - 1 at home to promoted @entity60			1
it was @entity21 's fourth defeat in the past six games so the @entity11 's @entity65 break falls at just the right time for @entity68 's men			0
" we can really use this break now , but it is only our fault , " @entity68 told reporters			0
" something that started well has ended badly			0
" i can say a lot of things in support of the team but we should have lost none of the games that we lost this season			0
" @entity2 has a seven - point lead over @entity54 and 12 - point cushion over @entity21 , with a game less played			0
third - place in the @entity7 went to @entity29 , which beat @entity87 3 - 2 thanks to a stoppage time winner from @entity90			2
former world player of the year @entity91 scored for @entity92 's @entity29 but was sent off in the 87th minute when he retaliated after being fouled .			0

@entity2 wins its fifth trophy of the year after *capturing* the @entity7
@entity2 beats @entity96 's @entity5 2 - 0 in saturday 's final in @entity9
@entity40 and @entity46 scored for the @entity99 champion in the first half
@entity2 is the heavy favorite to repeat in the @entity11 after its two main rivals faltered
