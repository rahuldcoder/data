-- three - time @entity2 winner @entity1 has been stripped of his 2010 title and retroactively banned from cycling for two years following monday 's ruling by the @entity6			1
he could also face a fine of more than $ 3 million , but this will be decided at a later @entity6 hearing			1
the @entity10 tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid clenbuterol during the sport 's premier race in july 2010 , and the results were revealed in september that year			1
he was initially suspended for one year by the @entity15 after claiming that he had eaten contaminated meat , which left small amounts of the drug in his urine sample , and was then acquitted on appeal in february 2011			1
however , the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) and the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) both contested the ruling , and appealed to @entity6			1
the @entity21 also asked that @entity1 be fined at least â ‚ ¬ 2.485 million			1
the court 's decision means that the 29 - year - old will lose his race victories during 2011 , including the @entity28			1
his ban will end on august 5 this year			2
@entity6 said the ban started retroactively on january 25 , 2011 -- the start date of his original ban -- but was reduced by the time he had already been suspended of five months and 19 days			1
the @entity21 confirmed the decision on its website , but called it " the end of a long - running affair that has been extremely painful for cycling			2
" " this is a sad day for our sport			2
some may think of it as a victory , but that is not at all the case , " @entity21 president @entity42 said			0
" there are no winners when it comes to the issue of doping : every case , irrespective of its characteristics , is always a case too many			0
" the case had dragged on after the first two hearings were canceled before a third was finally held in november last year			0
the @entity21 and @entity22 both submitted that it was more likely that @entity1 had either had a blood transfusion or eaten a contaminated food supplement rather than the meat scenario			1
@entity6 agreed in its ruling , stating : " unlike certain other countries , notably outside @entity66 , @entity60 is not known to have a contamination problem with clenbuterol in meat			1
furthermore , no other cases of athletes having tested positive to clenbuterol allegedly in connection with the consumption of @entity60 meat are known			0
" the panel concluded that both the meat contamination scenario and the blood transfusion scenario were , in theory , possible explanations for the adverse analytical findings but were however equally unlikely			0
" in the panel 's opinion , on the basis of the evidence adduced , presence of clenbuterol was more likely caused by the ingestion of a contaminated food supplement			1
" past cases of positive clenbuterol tests have had different outcomes			0
last year more than 100 footballers at the under - 17 @entity90 were cleared by @entity91 due to a " serious health problem with regards to meat contaminated with clenbuterol " in host nation @entity95			2
five members of that country 's senior team also escaped punishment after testing positive at the @entity100 later that year			0
two @entity102 swimmers were banned for three years in 1999 after eating contaminated pig livers , but in 2010 a @entity105 table tennis player was cleared following a hair test after his positive result during a competition in @entity102			1
@entity109 , who was runner - up at the @entity111 , said he would not be happy to be installed as the new winner			0
" first of all i feel sad for @entity1			1
i always believed in his innocence			0
this is just a very sad day for cycling			0
the only positive news is that there is a verdict after 566 days of uncertainty			0
we can finally move on , " the rider from @entity121 said			0
" i trust that the @entity6 judges took all things into consideration after reading a 4,000 - page file			2
if now i am declared overall winner of the @entity111 it will not make me happy			0
i battled with @entity1 in that race and i lost			2
" my goal is to win the @entity2 in a sportive way , being the best of all competitors , not in court			2
if i succeed this year , i will consider it as my first tour victory			0

@entity6 *overturns* ruling by the @entity15
appeal body says @entity1 likely consumed contaminated food supplement
the @entity10 has been banned retroactively for two years , ending in august 2012
he has also been stripped of his 2010 @entity2 title and all his 2011 victories
