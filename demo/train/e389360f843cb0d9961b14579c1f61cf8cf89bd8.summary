-- the upheaval in @entity2 has spiraled into an increasingly tense dispute between @entity4 and the @entity5			1
the @entity6 and many @entity8 countries are demanding that @entity9 scale back its deployment of troops in @entity2 's southern region of @entity13			1
but @entity4 president @entity14 so far appears unfazed by the pressure			1
by @entity4 's account , its soldiers are protecting the human rights of worried , vulnerable @entity4 speakers			2
but in the @entity6 view , @entity4 is violating international law			1
caught in the middle is @entity2 's shaky new government			1
with armed men are locked in an uneasy standoff in @entity13 , the consequences could be deadly			0
and their effects may ripple out far beyond @entity2 's corner of @entity30			1
what is @entity4 trying to achieve ? some commentators have suggested that @entity14 has overplayed his hand by sending troops into @entity13 , creating a situation that will hurt both @entity2 and @entity4			1
but others say it 's a calculated move based on the assessment that the @entity5 will fail to come up with a strong , unified response			0
" @entity14 's broader plan is to recreate some kind of ' @entity48 lite , ' a ring of countries under @entity9 's control , with the goal of boosting @entity4 's geopolitical standing , " @entity40 , a visiting scholar at the @entity41 think tank in @entity43 , writes in an opinion article for @entity0			2
if @entity14 gets what he wants in @entity2 , @entity40 says it augurs badly for other neighboring countries with @entity4 populations			2
he points to @entity9 's " de facto - annexation " of the @entity60 regions of @entity61 and @entity62 after the war between @entity4 and @entity60 in 2008			2
" beyond @entity2 , this conflict is also a defining moment for future @entity4 foreign policy , " @entity40 says			2
" if @entity9 succeeds in @entity2 , it will come to the conclusion that it can act like an empire			0
" on the ground in @entity13 : relaxed but eerie what options are available to the @entity6 and the @entity5 ? @entity72 is preparing potential sanctions that could freeze the overseas assets of @entity4 individuals and companies and impose travel bans on some @entity4 officials			1
but for many of the measures to really bite , @entity79 needs to get key @entity8 allies on board , some of whom appear reluctant to take too hard a line on @entity4			2
the @entity6 has already halted trade and investment talks and military - to - military engagements with @entity4			1
questions remain over how broad the sanctions will be , and whether the @entity6 can persuade its @entity8 allies to implement them			0
" inside the @entity94 there is no unity about the proper reaction , " says @entity40			0
one option for defusing the crisis , mentioned by @entity6 vice president @entity99 , would be the deployment of international monitors in the @entity13 to provide the protection to @entity4 citizens that @entity9 says its troops are providing			1
but @entity4 is n't showing any signs it intends to pull back its soldiers for the time being			0
what can @entity79 do about @entity4 's invasion of @entity13 ? why does n't the @entity6 respond militarily ? nobody in @entity72 appears eager for a military confrontation with @entity6 's nuclear - armed former @entity113 opponent			1
" the last thing anybody wants is a military option in this kind of situation , " said secretary of state @entity114			0
@entity6 officials say they are trying to find a way to deescalate the situation in @entity2 rather than provoke a wider conflagration			2
but the situation would become a more complicated if @entity4 moves troops beyond @entity13 into other parts of @entity2 , risking an all - out war with @entity127			1
some people are suggesting measures that include a military element but do n't go as far as direct confrontation			0
@entity132 sen. @entity132 of @entity133 called for the revival of plans for a @entity137 missile defense shield in @entity138 that @entity4 had strongly opposed			0
what is @entity4 's interest in @entity2 ? what are the wider effects of the crisis ? the standoff has had a significant effect in global markets , pushing up the price of oil			1
@entity4 is a key exporter of oil and natural gas			0
but experts say the world 's need for @entity4 energy supplies -- and @entity4 's need for the revenue generated -- should ensure the taps stay open throughout the crisis			2
concerns over @entity9 's involvement in @entity2 has hurt @entity4 's currency , the ruble , as well as its stock markets			1
the share prices of international companies that are heavily invested in @entity4 have also suffered			0
@entity2 , meanwhile , is one of the world 's top exporters of corn and wheat , whose prices could rise on concern those exports could come to a halt			0
what is @entity2 saying ? @entity2 's interim prime minister @entity179 , who has accused @entity9 of declaring war , vowed that his government would not give up @entity13			1
" nobody will give @entity13 away , " he said			0
" there are no grounds for the use of force against civilians and @entity2 , and for the entry of the @entity4 military contingent , " former @entity2 prime minister @entity190 said that if diplomacy fails to persuade @entity9 to withdraw its forces from the @entity2 region of @entity13 , the world should apply the " strongest means " on @entity4			1
asked by @entity0 's @entity196 if she was calling for the @entity5 to use military force against @entity4 , @entity190 avoided giving a direct answer , saying she " can not solve this issue			2
" @entity4 says that ousted @entity2 president @entity200 , whom @entity9 still recognizes as the country 's legitimate leader , requested that @entity4 send in military forces			1
what is the atmosphere like in @entity13 ? reporters on the ground say the standoff is a strange one			0
@entity4 soldiers wearing no military insignia have taken up positions around the region			0
they have blockaded @entity2 troops in their bases			0
but for the time being , the situation remains surprisingly calm			0
it has been " a very low - key kind of invasion , " @entity0 correspondent @entity218 reported monday from @entity221 , the @entity13 capital			0
but @entity4 forces " have complete operational control of the @entity13 peninsula , " a senior @entity6 administration official told @entity0			1
it appears that there is a " war of information " in the region " between those who watch @entity4 state tv and those who are getting their news from the @entity5 , none of them listening to the calls from @entity127 for unity in this country , " @entity218 reported .			0

the presence of @entity4 troops in @entity2 's @entity13 has *ratcheted* up tensions
@entity6 president @entity79 appears to have limited options to pressure @entity4
a military response is n't considered to be a realistic *possibility*
the crisis is *roiling* global markets , pushing up the price of oil and hurting the ruble
