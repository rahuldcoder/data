@entity1 , @entity0 -- the " crime scene cookies " , " baaji custard " and " sponge shafts " depicted in @entity8 's letter of complaint to @entity10 struck a chord worldwide			1
mean cuisine ? airline industry experts insist standards of in - flight food are improving			1
the missive he sent to @entity10 chairman sir @entity17 about a meal he received on board a @entity10 flight from @entity21 to @entity1 in december spread across the web and email with a vengeance			1
not only was this a complaint letter par excellence , but it hit upon one of the most emotive subjects of long - haul air travel : the in - flight meal			1
" food gets everybody going , whether they are sitting at the back end or the front end of the plane , " says @entity33 , marketing director at @entity34 , a @entity35 - based aviation research organization			1
" apart from the sheer fact you might be hungry , it is there to alleviate the boredom			0
because of that people tend to focus on it more			2
" but the criticism passengers target at airline food is not always warranted , @entity33 argues			1
@entity34 has been tracking airline service for a decade and every year it ranks airlines according to catering in economy , business and first class			2
@entity33 acknowledges that there have been cut backs on catering across short - haul flights and a decline in spending on food in long - haul economy			1
but @entity34 's research has also revealed a general improvement in standards over the last five years			2
" we are actually strong supporters of the overall quality that is served up across most airlines in most parts of the world , " says @entity33			2
standards have improved firstly as a result of greater competition between airline catering companies , says @entity33			2
what do you think ? are in - flight meals getting better or worse ? what was your worse meal ? sound off below			1
@entity80 catering company @entity79 has transformed the food served onboard @entity82 and @entity84 flights			2
@entity34 reported a 35 percent increase in customer satisfaction for @entity84 since do & @entity87 was hired in 2007			0
" in the last 15 - 20 years , the industry has focused on lean production			1
but we believe [ airline catering ] is not the job of a car manufacturer , " says @entity79 , ceo of do & co. good quality airline food not only depends on the quality of raw ingredients , he says , but also the intangible elements of good cuisine			1
" if you have chefs doing 3,000 filets on the grill , after 300 they lose the passion , " says @entity100			0
to inspire enthusiasm in its kitchens , do & @entity87 says it employs an unusually high ratio of chefs to work on a greater variety of dishes			0
they say they also insist on training cabin staff in food service ; they replace the dreaded disposable food trays with crockery ; and give passengers menus explaining where their fresh , local ingredients come from			2
airlines also use food as a marketing tool and improve standards to attract premium customers			2
@entity82 has won the @entity34 award for @entity128 for the last two years			0
as @entity132 , spokesman at @entity82 says , " the current situation in the airline industry is tough and costs have to be cut			1
but the competition is also very tough , so we need something that makes us unique compared to other airlines			0
" and for @entity82 , one unique selling point is its food			2
there is an on - board chef on every @entity82 flight who puts the crucial finishing touches on premium - class meals			1
the airline also offers a " @entity152 coffee house in the air " and one quarter of flight attendants are trained sommeliers to guide passengers through the extensive wine list			1
airlines worldwide also hire celebrity chefs to add prestige to their culinary efforts			0
@entity35 chef , @entity158 is one of @entity161 's " @entity160 " ; @entity162 works with @entity163 ; and @entity154 enlisted the services of @entity166 chef @entity165 to inspire its in - flight menu			1
chefs help airlines design meals that perform at high altitude			0
as @entity174 , @entity173 's celebrity chef has said , palates weaken in pressurized air cabins , which means dishes need to be made a more flavorful and seasoned than they would be on the ground			0
@entity33 at @entity34 is skeptical about the true benefits a celebrity chef can bring to onboard catering			0
after all , @entity158 is n't actually in the cabin saut√©ing the potatoes			0
but he does acknowledge that some chefs have influenced a new style of in - flight cuisine			1
chef @entity187 , hired by @entity188 in 2003 , initiated a move to healthy eating in first and business class			0
his work has since influenced standards across catering in all classes			0
@entity188 won the @entity34 award for @entity197 in 2008 partly as a result of simple enhancements such as the availability of fresh fruit between meals and from the self - serve bar in economy on its @entity206 aircraft			0
but as airlines grapple with a deepening recession , can passengers expect treats to vanish from food trays ? across short - haul flights , making cuts is an " easier game , " says @entity33			1
passengers notice it far less if an airline switches a sandwich for a packet of biscuits and a plastic cup of coffee , he says			0
but on long - haul flights , airlines are restrained in what they can cut			0
@entity33 : " people measure the standard of their flight by the quality of the food or the size of the portion they get			1
if a meal is cut back too severely they are going to walk away			0
" how important is food for you on flights ? is it good enough ? sound off below .			0
