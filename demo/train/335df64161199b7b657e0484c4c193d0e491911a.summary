-- despite online security concerns , the number of @entity2 who use mobile devices to access financial services is growing fast , according to new data from @entity7			1
in the fourth quarter of 2010 , almost 30 million @entity2 accessed their bank , credit card or brokerage accounts from a cell phone or tablet , up 54 % from the same quarter a year earlier			1
here 's how that growth breaks down for the three primary mobile banking channels ( note that some people use more than one ) : smartphone / tablet app : 10.8 million users , 120 % increase mobile web browser : 18.6 million users , 58 % increase @entity23 text messaging : 8.1 million users , 35 % increase nearly half of those surveyed say they primarily access financial services online via a desktop or laptop computer ; but 26 % said they primarily use mobile services for banking			1
only 10 % of respondents primarily do their banking in person at a branch , and only 4 % primarily handle their banking via voice calls			0
new services that help people avoid trips to the bank or @entity43 may be helping boost the popularity of mobile financial apps			2
for instance , many major banks now offer smartphone apps that allow you to make a deposit by taking a picture of the front and back of the check			2
why do n't more people access mobile financial services ? @entity7 found some interesting differences between smartphone users and the nearly three - fourths of @entity2 mobile users who own feature phones ( simpler phones that are the next step down from smartphones )			1
the biggest obstacle to using mobile financial services is simple habit or preference : 53 % of smartphone owners and 45 % of feature phone owners reported , " i prefer to conduct my transactions online from a fixed device			2
" intriguingly , a quarter of smartphone users reported , " accessing my account through my cell phone is too slow			1
" yet only 9 % of feature phone users had the same complaint , even though feature phones typically rely on slower wireless data networks and have browsers that are more limited and harder to navigate			2
roughly a third of both groups reported concerns about mobile security -- and there is reason for concern			0
in october , @entity88 reported that even though computer - based internet access to banking probably poses more security risks , most banks now have a decade or more of experience with managing those risks			0
in contrast , most banks have less experience with mobile services and their attendant risks , and so the risks are amplified by what the banks simply have n't learned yet			0
last fall , the @entity102 reported that several banks were rushing to fix security holes in their mobile apps , mostly regarding how the apps were storing data on cell phones			0
in general , if you are using a mobile financial services app , it 's a good idea not to save your password in the app. also , it 's more secure to use the app over your wireless carrier 's network , rather than on an open @entity118			1
and , of course , remember to lock your phone with a security code or pattern			0
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity125 .			0
