-- when police arrested @entity3 , accused in the death of a @entity6 state trooper , they symbolically used the equipment of their fallen brother , cpl. @entity8 , to take @entity3 into custody			1
they drove the suspect in @entity8 's police vehicle , put him in @entity8 's handcuffs , took him to the barracks where the shooting occurred , and held @entity3 there until he was moved to the correctional facility in @entity17			1
this drew some immediate attention			0
some have questioned if these customs constitute the law enforcement equivalent of taunting , possibly prejudicing the arrest and evidence			1
others might criticize the expenditure of government resources for purely symbolic gesturesâ € ” like transporting an ordinary pair of handcuffs great distances , when a pair of local zip - ties could do the job			1
so , should we discourage these law enforcement traditions ? the legal verdict ? nah			0
let the police do this			0
and that 's coming from a criminal defense attorney			1
using a fallen comrade 's equipment to bring in a suspect is hardly new			1
it 's been going on for years , though i could find little information about the origin of this department ritual			1
is using a slain officer 's cuffs tantamount to a public statement about the guilt or innocence of a suspect ? sure , but then again , so is an arrest and indictment			1
the origin of the cuffs is the least of an arrestee 's legal worries			1
should we be spending government resources transporting a specific set of handcuffs or a police vehicle for its symbolic relevance ? one might argue that if bringing those handcuffs costs even one dollar more than just using local handcuffs , a merely symbolic gesture may not be warranted			2
the reality is that our government spends money on symbolism all the time			2
does our government " need " to pay the head coach at the @entity79 $ 1.5 million ? is the @entity80 required to send athletes to the @entity82 ? do we really even need the @entity83 ? none of these are technically necessary to the operation of our government , but there is value to demonstrating the majesty of democracy , both at home and abroad			0
when viewed against some of the other things our government spends money on , requisitioning a pair of special handcuffs for a special arrest hardly seems excessive			1
government symbolism has real value ; and value sometimes costs real dollars			2
should the police be engaged in any symbolic taunting of suspects ? in the vast majority of cases , no. not just because suspects are presumed innocent , but also because taunting suspects would undermine community confidence in police , and possibly undermine the arrest itself			2
as it is , an arrest is a public event , and already humiliating enough on its own			2
but cop killings are different			0
law enforcement is highly protective of its own ; a slaying of a fellow officer breaks down all barriers between different departments and agencies			2
in this case , it is no longer business , it 's very personal			0
after all , it could have been any of them ambushed that day			0
police deal with constant scrutinyâ € ” by the community , defense lawyers and even their own prosecutors			0
oh , and they can get killed doing their job			0
it 's no surprise they develop an us - against - the - world mentality , which makes the bond among them even stronger			0
while departments must closely referee to guard against excessive celebration with suspects , we can probably look the other way when it comes to some strategic use of otherwise standard equipment to honor a comrade .			0

@entity147 : some have questioned whether cops arresting @entity3 out of line
they used the slain officer 's handcuffs , his *squad* *car* , and held suspect at his barracks
he says there 's long tradition of such symbolism . it 's no more of a statement than an arrest is
@entity147 , a defense attorney , says not likely it would be seen as prejudicing arrest , evidence
