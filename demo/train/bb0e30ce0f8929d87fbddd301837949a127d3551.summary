-- moored on the waters of @entity2 , just east of @entity3 and the @entity4 , is -- well , a mystery			1
atop a barge docked at @entity7 , site of a former @entity9 base , is a four - story structure made from shipping containers			1
the purpose of the structure remains unknown , but the safe money says @entity15 is up to something on board			2
officials wo n't say exactly what 's going on there			0
but some sleuthing by the media in the tech - heavy @entity23 has pretty much nailed down that @entity15 , headquartered about 40 miles south in @entity24 , @entity25 , is behind the project			1
tech blog @entity27 reported as much on friday , citing lease agreements , @entity7 locals and " tracking a contact tied to the project on @entity32			0
" news reports say an unknown company has been working on a major project , under tight security , in a hangar on @entity7 since last year			0
witnesses say materials from that hangar were transferred onto the barge			0
@entity15 did not respond to a request to comment for this story			1
so , even if the suspicions about @entity15 and the barge 's mysterious cargo are correct , that leaves the obvious question : what are they building in there ? early speculation has centered on a data center			1
@entity15 has banks of servers stored in warehouses all over the world , and floating data centers are n't unheard of			1
sitting on that much water would provide an obvious source of cooling , which is a big concern for data centers , and possibly even a source of power			2
and @entity15 has a patent for such a project			2
but @entity2 station @entity65 , a @entity0 affiliate , threw a twist into the narrative , quoting unnamed " sources close to the project " as saying the structure will be retail space -- a sort of floating @entity15 store			1
@entity15 hopes to tow the structure across the bay to @entity2 , where it would be used to market @entity77 , the company 's connected eyewear , @entity65 reported			1
@entity77 , the company 's big leap into wearable technology , puts computer capabilities into eyeglasses			0
the headsets so far have been released only to early testers and are expected to go on sale to consumers in the coming months			0
an official with the @entity88 told @entity65 that there have been discussions with @entity15 about " hypothetical operations " on the bay			0
but work on the project suddenly stopped a few weeks ago			0
one possible reason : an insider close to the commission told @entity65 that @entity15 " ca n't park this barge on the waterfront without a permit , and they do n't have one			2

" @entity104 " on @entity2 may be a @entity15 project
barge holds mysterious four - story structure
speculation centers on data center , possible marketing center for @entity77
@entity15 has not responded to requests for comment
