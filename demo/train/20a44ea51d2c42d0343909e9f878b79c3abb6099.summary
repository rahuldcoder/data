even in the @entity1 , coroners do n't use the word " miracle " lightly			0
but @entity4 , @entity5 , coroner @entity6 has no qualms using the word for the resurrection , as it were , of @entity8 , who was declared dead wednesday night			1
@entity6 received the call from @entity8 ' hospice nurse , who told @entity6 that the 78 - year - old had passed away			1

" there was no pulse			0
he was lifeless , " @entity6 said			0
the coroner completed his paperwork , placed @entity8 in a body bag and transported him to the funeral home , he said			1
there , something strange happened : the body bag moved			0

@entity6 is an elected official and not a doctor			0

neither in his 12 years as county coroner nor during his decade as deputy coroner has @entity6 seen anything like it			2
@entity6 was absolutely certain @entity8 was dead			2
the only reasonable explanation he could think of , @entity6 said , is that @entity8 ' defibrillator , implanted beneath the skin on his chest , jump - started his heart after he was placed in the body bag			1

" he said , ' @entity88 's still here			2
' " " i do n't know how long he 's going to be here , but i know he 's back right now			2
