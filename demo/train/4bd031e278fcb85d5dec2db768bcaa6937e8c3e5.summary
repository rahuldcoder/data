@entity0 , @entity1 -- heroin , cocaine and amphetamines are the kind of street drugs you expect to find in the shady corners of any city , hiding away from the glare of law enforcement			1
but in one small space in downtown @entity0 addicts openly inject their fixes -- as medics watch on			1
this is @entity18 , @entity20 's only legal safe drug injection center			1
a banner outside reads " @entity18 saves lives			1
" it 's a facility where drug addicts can bring and use their drugs and not risk arrest			1
some of the addicts line up two or three times a day to use one of the 12 injection booths			2
one of the first users of the day is @entity32			2
the center opens at 10 a.m. and then runs steadily for 18 hours until 4 a.m. approximately 800 people use the booths every day			2
@entity32 gives his alias to the receptionist -- all @entity18 users have an official alias to protect their identity -- and moves into the injection room			1
he takes a seat and calmly begins to prepare his hit of heroin			2
he uses the clean needle and sterile equipment provided by @entity18			1
the white powder is mixed with water in a spoon , gently heated with a candle , before being drawn into the syringe , and injected into the inside of @entity32 's elbow			0
it 's not for the squeamish			0
there 's quite a lot of blood			0
with fluorescent lighting and lots of mirrors , the atmosphere is clinical , even as the room fills with drug addicts focused on one task only -- feeding their addiction			1
medical staff are on hand and watching closely			2
if needed they can help addicts find the right vein to shoot up into -- something which can be tricky for long - term users			1
but their main job is to step in when a user overdoses			0
@entity32 has overdosed here three times			0
" i 'm glad it was here [ where i overdosed ]			0
it 's still in my hope that maybe i can get clean			0
and that 's why these places ... it 's just , it 's common sense ! when you have a problem that 's grown for whatever reason to the epic proportions that it has in this city , it 's time to come up with a really good solution , and this is it			0
" @entity0 is regularly lauded as one of the best places in the world to live			1
it 's famously the city where you can ski in the morning , and swim in the afternoon			0
but the quality of life in the alleyways behind @entity18 is something altogether different			1
the @entity103 side is often labeled as the poorest postal code in @entity105 , which stands in stark contrast to the rest of the city 's red hot real estate market			0
the alleyways are full of thousands of drug addicts , prostitutes and dealers			1
@entity113 estimates that these few blocks are home to more than 5,000 intravenous drug users			2
in the alleys we meet @entity119 -- another long - term user - who has used @entity18 since it opened in 2003			1
she is articulate , educated , and angry			0
she says that without @entity18 addicts would be still be getting high but without any of the medical oversight			1
to many around the world it may seem astonishing that a place like @entity18 exists			1
but for the people in the nearby streets who use it , it 's a lifeline			0
clean needles stop the spread of infections like @entity136 and @entity137 , and daily access to medical staff is all the more important for people living in harsh , exposed conditions			1
in 1997 , @entity0 had the highest rate of @entity136 in the developed world			1
using @entity18 makes sense , says @entity119			1
it relieves the pressure of shooting up behind rubbish bins , or using dirty puddle water , or relying on a shared needle			0
" we have to stop making it a moral issue and realise that this is a medical problem			2
remember us addicts , we 're somebody 's mothers , we 're somebody 's sister , we 're somebody 's daughter -- we 're not just a number -- the next time you pass me on the street and shake your head			2
" of course not everyone agrees with safe injection sites			2
author , actor , and addiction counselor , @entity169 , opened @entity105 's first ever residential treatment center for addicts back in 1967			2
he firmly believes that the best harm reduction strategies are centered on abstinence			0
" there 's only one problem with this place [ @entity18 ]			1
it ignores completely the mechanics of addiction			0
what are the mechanics of addiction ? the mechanics of addiction are i want more			0
" i understand reaching out and saying , ' @entity183 , @entity184 , you want to get clean ? let 's go do some work			0
it can happen , you can do it			0
' i do n't understand , ' here 's a needle , go shoot some more			2
' " @entity18 is funded by taxpayers , at a cost of $ 3 million @entity105 per year			1
it says for every tax dollar spent , four are saved , by preventing expensive medical treatments for addicts further down the line			1
the center has some support from the mayor , local government and some residents			0
the opening of @entity18 was a major campaign issue in @entity0 's 2002 civic elections			1
supervised injection sites are not supported , however , by the @entity105 federal government			0
prime minister @entity210 's opposition to @entity18 is well - documented			1
speaking in 2005 , he said : " we as a government will not fund drug use			2
" his then health minister , @entity214 , went further in a 2008 letter to @entity105 's " @entity217 " newspaper : " a more apt analogy of what @entity18 does ... would be a doctor holding a cigarette to make sure a smoker does n't burn his lips , or watching a woman with cardiac problems eat fatty @entity227 fries to ensure she swallows them properly			1
" the site is allowed to stay open only with a special license -- the result of a bitter battle with the @entity105 government that went to the @entity105 @entity235			1
in september 2011 judges ruled in favor of keeping @entity18 open against the wishes of prime minister @entity210			1
the court said @entity18 allows drug addicts access to the same healthcare as other @entity105 citizens			1
the dramatic @entity235 ruling set a precedent and other cities in @entity105 , including @entity247 and @entity248 , had been watching closely			1
councilor @entity249 is chairman of the @entity251			0
" the @entity235 ruling is a game changer			1
now actually it 's the law of the land that we have to provide equal access to medical services , including to people with drug addiction			1
so we 've made progress			0
" a four - year study into the viability of injection rooms in @entity266 province recommended three sites in @entity247 , and two more in @entity268 - the nation 's capital			0
but the findings of the @entity247 and @entity271 ( @entity272 ) , published in 2012 , were swiftly rejected by the @entity274 administration			0
@entity247 's drug problem is not as visible as @entity0 's but it 's still there , with about 9,000 people in the city shooting up daily			1
as @entity272 revealed , more than 50 percent of the public supported the opening of an injection room in @entity266			0
@entity249 thinks it 's only a matter of time			0
" we 've started to get people to face the very difficult fact that if you do not provide this medical service you are killing people			2
and i think it 's only a few years away until we have a supervised injection site here in @entity247			0
" injection rooms exist in a number of countries			0
the first opened in @entity296 in 1986 , and since then @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 and others have followed suit			0
accepting injection rooms as a legitimate part of drug strategy is hard for @entity169 to comprehend			2
" it 's more humane to help a person stay stupid ? to help a person stay enslaved ? you do n't need to have heroin or needles or crack pipe kits to entice people to health			2
you could approach people and say , " let me look at that sore			0
let 's clean you up a bit			0
" " but for people like @entity119 , it 's a harsh reality that she may never get off drugs			0
she has been using for 20 years and @entity18 is her best hope of staying connected with medical and welfare services			1
" i 'm entitled to healthcare , and being treated like a human being , and not being looked at as somebody that is n't , somebody you do n't want to talk about , like a dirty little secret			0
" @entity18 in general , it 's saved my life once , and it saved my husband 's life on three different occasions			1
" she has a swift retort when asked whether other cities should open injection rooms			2
" do they have drug users ? and if the answer is yes , then the answer is embrace it			2
" @entity343 contributed to this report			0

safe haven in @entity0 allows drug addicts to shoot up safely and without fear of arrest
*controversially* , @entity18 does not require addicts to try to kick their habits
@entity235 ruled it should stay open as it was giving access to medical care
@entity18 is the only legal safe haven facility in @entity20
