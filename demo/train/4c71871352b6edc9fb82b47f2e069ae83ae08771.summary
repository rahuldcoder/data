-- the press has turned on president @entity2 with a vengeance			1
suddenly , the @entity5 briefing room is filled with confrontational questions			0
suddenly , the news pages are ablaze with scandal , and the commentators -- even some of the president 's usual defenders -- are bemoaning his shortcomings			1
suddenly , @entity2 is n't getting the benefit of the doubt			1
according to @entity2 's longtime detractors , the denizens of the fourth estate are finally climbing out of a tank in which they have been immersed since roughly 2007			1
but the reality is a bit more nuanced than that			0
there are a number of unsavory allegations swirling around @entity26 , but do not underestimate the importance of the @entity28 seizing two months of @entity30 phone records without so much as a heads - up			1
this not only seems like a case of prosecutorial overreach , even in a case involving national security , it strikes at the heart of what journalists do -- and has fostered feelings of betrayal			0
does the administration not understand the chilling effect on reporters and their sources , they wonder , or simply not care ? it 's easy to say that news organizations recoiled from @entity2 only when their own special interests were threatened , and maybe there 's some truth to that			1
but the media also have a deep , abiding love for scandal , and beyond the @entity30 phone records story , the administration is lately providing that scandal in spades			1
the battle over @entity62 has mostly divided along partisan lines , with conservatives seeing a sustained coverup and liberals perceiving a partisan attack on what was a bungled operation and confused aftermath			0
but the report by @entity72 's @entity71 alleging the scrubbing of the @entity74 talking points ( following a less - noticed report by @entity77 of the @entity78 ) transformed the tone of the coverage in a single stroke			2
the @entity71 report turned out to be based on an inaccurate , misleading characterization of an email , but for the first time , many journalists came to believe the administration had something to hideâ € ” and that they had been personally misled in press briefings			1
that is guaranteed to get the blood flowing			0
the disclosure that the @entity93 selectively targeted conservative groups for review brought immediate condemnation from many across the media spectrum , including @entity99 , who investigated the nixonian abuses , of which this story carries an unmistakable echo			0
and it is the trifecta of these scandalous sagas that will dominate coverage for months as media outlets feast on the cycle of investigations , hearings , subpoenas , resignations and denials			0
any doubt that scandal trumps ideology in the media firmament can be dispelled with a glance back at @entity119 's tenure , when what he called the " knee - jerk liberal press " investigated @entity122 , @entity123 and other allegations with a fervor that eventually put it on a virtual war footing against the @entity5			1
more troubling for the current crew is that news outlets are starting to pivot to broader questions about whether @entity2 is competent at the business of government or a passive bystander in his own administration			2
that impression , if it takes hold , can not be etch - a - sketched away			0
to be sure , some of @entity2 's antagonists will overreach by framing every scandal as the next @entity141 and each revelation as an impeachable offense			1
that may trigger a counter-reaction in which some of the president 's liberal allies shift their focus from the administration 's missteps to the opposition 's overkill			0
some in the media rolled over for @entity2 in the 2008 campaign , though the record was decidedly more mixed once he took office			2
but personal feelings toward this president who has never courted the press no longer matter ; nor do personal predilections on gun control and immigration reform			0
the scandal machinery has kicked into high gear , and its sheer noise may drown out everything else			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			2

@entity169 : @entity30 phone records *search* , other stories have turned press on @entity2
he says attention is n't just out of press self - interest ; @entity2 's stuck in number of scandals
he says that for the first time , press started to think @entity2 misled them
@entity169 : @entity185 may overreach to *damage* @entity2 ; still , scandal could drown out governing
