-- fashion is about making a statement			0
designer @entity3 has been culling imagery from socio - political issues like the fall of the @entity7 and the @entity9 's " separation barrier " to create high fashion for nearly a decade			1
" the fabric becomes a canvas , and you 're basically saying something , " @entity3 told @entity0 in her lower @entity12 showroom			1
" the idea is not to express my own opinion , but rather to provoke a thought or an opinion of whoever is wearing it or whoever is watching it			0
" next month , the @entity24 - born designer will display a retrospective of her " @entity29 " series at her @entity28 store			1
she 'll recut her signature silk cami dresses from past collections for the project , as well as debut a new dress featuring politically - charged photography by @entity36			0
proceeds will be donated to help both sides of the recent @entity24 - @entity40 hostilities that killed more than 2,000 people and severely damaged @entity43 's infrastructure			1
@entity3 , who moved to @entity28 from @entity24 in 1980 , said like most creatives , she draws on what she knows -- her upbringing and subsequent life experiences -- to find inspiration			1

" from the day i remember sound , i remember every day my dad listened to the radio news			0
" interactive : @entity65 her love of clothes and art , though , came solely from her mother , who had studied textile design before the war and never really got to use it on a larger scale after she emigrated to @entity24			1
" one of the mediums she expressed her creativity was clothes , and back in those days , it sounds strange , but we really did n't have too many stores to go and buy clothes , " @entity3 said , so her mother made them for the family			1
a resident of @entity24 , @entity3 served the mandatory two years of military service for women , as social services chair of the air force			1
after her service , she enrolled in @entity89 , with her mother 's urging , after an academic degree opened up specifically for textile and fashion design			0
