-- the astounding discovery that our universe apparently is expanding at an accelerating rate some 14 billion years after the @entity1 has earned three scientists the 2011 @entity7 , the @entity8 announced tuesday			1
the discovery turned the world of physics and astronomy on its head when it was first reported in 1998 by competing teams of scientists , two from the @entity16 and one from @entity18			0
it helped lead scientists to the conclusion that nearly three - fourths of the universe is made up of " dark energy , " a mysterious force that seems to be staying gravity 's hand in stopping the universe from expanding forever			1
the nature and role of that force has become what the @entity33 organization described as one of the most enigmatic mysteries of modern physics			0
half of the @entity40 award will go to @entity41 from @entity42 and the @entity43			1
the other half was awarded to @entity45 of @entity46 and @entity47 of @entity48 and the @entity49			1
the prize in physics is worth 10 million @entity53 kronor , about $ 1.44 million			1
" i am delighted , excited , and deeply honored , " @entity41 said in a written statement			1
@entity55 called the project " an incredibly exciting adventure " in a statement issued by @entity48			0
" i am deeply honored that this work has been recognized			1
the two teams , working separately , each measured the light coming from a specific kind of exploding star , or supernova , in what began as an effort to confirm expectations that the expansion of the universe was slowing down			1
instead , they found that the exploding stars they were using as galactic yardsticks were dimmer than they had expected , indicating that the galaxies containing them were racing away from each other and the rest of the universe at an accelerating rate			1
the widely celebrated discovery indicated that a mysterious and invisible form of energy is counteracting the force of gravity , pushing matter apart at an ever faster rate			0
" today , we know that 74 percent of the universe consists of this dark energy , " @entity47 wrote on his website before the award was announced			1
" understanding its nature remains one of the most pressing tasks for physicists and astronomers alike			0
" the discovery means that the universe is likely to continue expanding indefinitely , instead of reaching a steady state or collapsing back in on itself in what some call a " big crunch			2
" " the findings of the 2011 @entity103 in @entity7 have helped to unveil a universe that to a large extent is unknown to science			1
and everything is possible again , " the academy said in announcing the prize			2
the @entity7 is the second of six @entity33 prizes to be announced this month			2
last year , professors @entity111 and @entity113 from the @entity114 in @entity115 won the physics prize for " groundbreaking " experiments with the two - dimensional material graphene			2
since 1901 , the committee has handed out the @entity7 104 times			2
the youngest recipient was @entity123 , who won in 1915 at the age of 25			0
@entity123 is not only the youngest physics laureate , he is also the youngest laureate in any @entity7 area			2
the oldest physics laureate was @entity127 , who was 88 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2002			0
in the coming days , the committee will announce prizes in chemistry , literature , economics and peace			0
on monday , the @entity33 committee named @entity136 , a biologist with @entity138 , and scientists @entity139 and @entity141 the winners of the 2011 @entity143			0
the announcement came three days after @entity136 died of pancreatic cancer at age 68			0
@entity33 rules do n't allow awards to be given posthumously , but the @entity149 issued a statement after the award was announced saying it interprets the rule to mean that no one can be deliberately given the award after death			0
since the group 's members did not know of @entity136 's death when they made the decision , the award will stand , the assembly said .			0

new : winners say they are " deeply honored "
@entity41 , @entity45 and @entity47 win the @entity7
they discovered that the universe 's expansion is accelerating
the prize is worth about 10 million @entity53 kronor , or $ 1.44 million
