-- we 've all heard the old adage that travel is about the journey , not the destination			0
now , a travel company in @entity7 , @entity8 , is taking the concept so literally that it 's not even bothering to list the destinations on its newest city tour			1
that 's because not even the company knows where its customers will be heading once they 've booked a tour			2
the company is called topology and its unique , experiential tour is called the @entity18			2
' we 're going where ? ' though the results can range from mundane to memorable , the @entity18 concept is simple			0
customers pay @entity22 , 000 ( $ 33 ) for the privilege of doing a ride - along in a local taxi for a four - hour stint			1
the tourists travel wherever the taxi is called upon to go by its normal customers			1
topology -- the same company that let travelers to be a sweet potato mama for a day -- says the appeal of the tour comes from traveling to destinations entirely dictated by whoever hires the taxi			1
" this idea came to me a long time ago when i was a passenger in a taxi , " says @entity39 , @entity30 co-founder			2
" that driver was so talkative that we chatted nonstop during the half - hour drive			1
he told me where to find great food in town			0
" " ever since , i 've thought letting taxi drivers and local commuters be city guides might be a good idea			2
" @entity30 's @entity18 tour was launched last month			2
so far one traveler from the @entity54 and one from @entity56 have tried the tour , according to the company			1
those two tours ended up zipping past usual tourist spots such as @entity61 , @entity62 and the @entity63			0
they also took in places that are n't easily accessible to travelers , such as locations in @entity68 , an hour from @entity7 's city center			1
unknown alleys , dinner invitations @entity39 took a trial ride before the tour was officially launched			1
" at first , it felt really weird , honestly , because we never sit in a taxi for such a long time and ( never ) meet people we are n't familiar with , " he says			0
" but even for those of us who were born and raised in @entity7 , we hit some alleys we 've never been to and saw scenes that we would n't see if we were on foot			2
" aside from new sights , @entity39 says the main draw of @entity18 is the chance to meet local people			0
" @entity8 are famous for our hospitality , so travelers can make friends with local commuters and the driver , " he says			1
" one passenger invited @entity94 , our traveler from @entity56 , to her new house in the @entity97 and treated him a big meal with her family			1
" finding the right drivers finding taxi drivers willing to collaborate was challenging at first			0
" we needed to convince drivers that this tour would n't impact their business , that it 's ( actually ) going to help due to the extra income they receive from the tour , " says @entity39			0
@entity18 now works with five @entity56 - speaking taxi drivers			1
signs displayed in each cab explain the tour concept to potential customers before they decide to hire the cab			2
another bonus for the drivers , according to @entity39 , is exposure to foreigners			0
" the drivers might not have too many chances to go abroad , but travelers can bring the world to them , " he says			0
" our taxi drivers are all happy to have the chance to connect to the world			0
" so what if there are n't a lot of passengers during a given tour ? " this never happens , but our backup plan is to take travelers to traditional tourist spots and enjoy a local meal with the driver			1
" taxi drivers are the best tour guides -- they know @entity7 so well and the meals they choose are always awesome			1
" a journey is not about the sights , but about the insights gained from the experience and the people you meet			0
" these are what make a journey unique and unforgettable			0
" @entity148 ; @entity22 , 000 ( $ 33 ) for four hours ; discount of @entity150 ( $ 12 ) for the first three participants each month ; booking available online on the topology website ; tours can accommodate up to two travelers .			0

a new tour in @entity7 , @entity8 , allows tourists to do four - hour ride - alongs in local taxis
tourists go wherever local fares hire the cabs to go
the appeal is going to *unexpected* locations and meeting chatty locals
one @entity56 tourist was invited to a @entity8 family dinner by a passenger in his taxi
