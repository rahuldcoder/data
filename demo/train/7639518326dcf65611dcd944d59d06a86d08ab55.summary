-- the @entity1 announced thursday it is requiring manufacturers of insomnia products , such as @entity4 , @entity4 and @entity5 , to lower their current recommended doses			2
the drugs contain an active ingredient called zolpidem , which causes drowsiness			1
researchers have found high levels of zolpidem in the blood of some patients the morning after a dose -- so much so it affects patients ' cognitive skills , including their ability to drive			0
the @entity1 said using lower doses of zolpidem will cut down on the amount of the drug found in the bloodstream the following morning			1
it also noted that the recommended dosage should be lower for women , because they do n't process zolpidem out of their system as quickly as men			0
the agency recommended the dosage of zolpidem for women be lowered to 5 milligrams from 10 milligrams for immediate - release products and to 6.25 milligrams from 12.5 milligrams for extended - release products			0
patients who use the extended - release forms of these drugs have an even higher risk for next morning impairment , according to the @entity1			1
the @entity1 said new labeling on the insomnia products will let doctors know they should consider a lower dose for men , especially for those who are having difficulty concentrating the next morning			2
and all patients , the @entity1 said , should be told about the possible " morning after " risks			1
" patients should also read the medication guides and understand the benefits and risks of these drugs , " said dr. @entity46 of the @entity1 's @entity47			1
" we believe that by lowering these doses , we can decrease the side effects that happen the morning after			0
" @entity46 said that those who are taking these drugs talk to their doctors first before changing the dosage			0
he added that morning impairment is not limited to products with zolpidem			0
drowsiness is a symptom listed on a number of insomnia drugs , and @entity46 said that alertness may be impaired even if the person does n't feel sleepy			1
in making its recommendations , the @entity1 looked at findings from a large driving simulation study that showed some people taking products containing zolpidem had higher levels of the drug in their system and could not operate a vehicle as well as those who did not take the drugs , or who took lower doses .			2
