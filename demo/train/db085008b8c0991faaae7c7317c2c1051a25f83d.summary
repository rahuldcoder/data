-- do you ever wish you could snap your fingers and change your world ? as a child , i certainly did			1
because like many kids , i was an outsider			1
and like many kids of the 1970s , i pretended to be @entity9 from " @entity9			1
" ok , friends have advised me that this may not have been the first choice of most 8 - year - old boys , since it 's slightly disturbing and maybe a little pathetic			1
but come on , can you blame me ? i was a budding homo who was musical , gawky and deaf in one ear			1
do the math. and the character of @entity9 represented power			1
a take - no - prisoners attitude			1
so with the help of a bedspread ( which approximated the caftans @entity9 wore and became my magical cape -- hey , when you 're 8 , you got ta improvise ) , i would close my eyes , wave my arms and cast spells to try to change my world			1
it was a world fraught with an obsessive compulsive clean freak mother , limbed and limbless bullies , and a series of unfortunate life events that would challenge even the most formidable witch			1
of course , i 'm an adult now			1
and i no longer don that tattered bedspread , mostly because it 's not nearly as cute at this age			1
but like most of us , i still long for that mystical connection , that idea that i have some measure of jurisdiction over my own universe			1
because let 's face it , things can get really twisted these days			1
so how do we invoke magic as adults ? i have a few ideas i 'd like to share that have worked for me			1
none , you may be relieved to know , involves a beehive hairdo or making potions			1
they 're just simple activities that , at least for my money , help bring me a little bit closer to the mystical element of life			1
first , i try to meditate			2
i emphasize try because for me , being forced to sit still is a form of brutality that should be covered under the @entity69 convention			2
as someone juggling two jobs , as an exec for a tv network and as a writer ( substitute your jobs here -- career woman and mother , rodeo clown and underwear model , etc. ) , i often have a hard time slowing down for a stoplight without checking my e-mail			1
but when i do meditate , magical things happen			2
song lyrics for new gangsta rap tunes			2
which really makes shutting up worthwhile			2
second , i have a dream board			1
i think those ugly cork boards ( where you tack up pictures of the things you want ) actually work			2
because they 're a great reinforcement			2
i had a mock - cover of my first book up on mine before i even got an agent			2
and the publication process could not have been easier			2
i 'm just sayin '			2
of course , my dream board is a rugged steel panel with magnets , which just screams manly			1
and it 's in my bathroom , which probably seems kinda weird , but it 's the one spot in the house i know i 'll be in every day with my eyes open			2
and talk about a captive audience			2
third , i try to speak in positives			1
about 15 years ago , i was $ 53,000 in debt from some business decisions apparently made while i was either drunk or insane			0
i constantly reinforced my poverty with my friends as if being broke was a badge of honor , like military service or watching @entity119 documentaries			0
it was n't until i began talking about how i was gon na get myself out of debt that it actually happened			0
i talked positively about my situation to anyone who would listen			0
and within months , i met a wonderful woman at a party who changed the direction of my career , and in one year 's time ( albeit a year i had to work like a rower on a slave ship ) , i was debt - free			0
how 's that for magic ? fourth , i listen to that little voice in my head -- what is usually referred to as " women 's intuition			1
" with no disrespect to my female readers , stop hogging the glory ! everybody has intuition , most people just do n't listen			1
i like to think of it as @entity147 whispering in my ear , although , because i only have one ear that works , i hope he whispers in the right one			0
of course , sometimes he can scream like a hog caller and we do n't pay any attention			0
example : someone got me involved , a few years back , with a scam artist			0
i had a very bad feeling about him from the minute i met him			0
and let me tell you , it cost me plenty			0
finally , i try to accept what is			0
this is not very entertaining and can , in fact , be a bummerpalooza			0
and , i must admit , i do n't always do it without attempting to take someone down with me			0
after all , spreading the pain around seems like the democratic thing to do			0
but there really is a kind of peace in surrender , in simply saying , " what will be , will be , because i 'm too freaking exhausted to try to control it			0
" in the aftermath of this group of us being scammed , for example , there was a lot of screaming ( mine ) and tears ( also mine )			0
i was constantly imagining this guy 's death in a highly entertaining car crash			0
i twisted myself into knots over it -- until i realized that the only person my anger was hurting was me			0
so i handed it over to a law firm and stepped away			0
and in doing so , i stopped getting sick			0
and i stopped yelling at random people on the street , which made for much more pleasant interactions with cops and homeless folk			0
do these tips actually work ? i think they have for me			0
but really , does it matter ? science has shown that positive thinking speeds healing			1
and that meditation can improve your health			1
even if activities like these are only palliative , how much can it hurt ? after all , we live in a world where every day is filled with both tragedies and triumphs			0
so maybe , with a little magical thinking , we can tip the scale a tiny bit toward the triumphs			0

a lonely gay kid used to pretend to be the witch @entity9 from tv show " bewitched "
now he brings positive " magic " into adulthood to improve the quality of his life
the author *recommends* meditating , *keeping* a dream board and listening to intuition
try speaking in positives and accepting what happens in your life
