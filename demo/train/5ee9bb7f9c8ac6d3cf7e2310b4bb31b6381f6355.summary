-- in many ways , airplanes are a retailer 's dream come true			2
they serve a captive -- often bored -- audience who have proven their income is disposable enough to afford air travel			2
it 's no wonder that in the last few years , airlines have adapted an increasingly sophisticated approach to parting customers from their money			1
" by nature , airlines are mass transit operators , and they did n't necessarily have any retail savviness when they first started to unbundle -- it was very much low - hanging fruits , like chocolate bars and @entity24 up and down the aisle , " says @entity21 , senior vice president of global strategy at @entity22 , a provider of in - flight retail solutions			1
" now , there 's a new sense of maturity in retail strategies with airlines , " he adds			1
lately , carriers have replaced mass market beers with craft brews , standard chips with locally sourced gourmet goodies , and added ticketed events to the retail roster			1
in 2011 , @entity38 even experimented with selling cars on board their flights , becoming the first carrier to do so			1
" we think of flight as a travel megastore ; we expect to make money for the products that we offer , " says @entity43 , @entity38 's vice president for communications			1
in many ways , the @entity50 carrier has been a trailblazer when it comes to its retail offerings			2
@entity43 claims it was the first airline to introduce bicycle rentals , and the first to accept @entity57 as a form of payment			1
it was also one of the first airlines to allow non-passengers to make surprise purchases ( think roses and champagne ) for their friends in the air			1
currently , customers can also buy @entity38 - branded shoes on the flight			1
" some things have been batted around in terms of thinking outside the box , in terms of ' how wacky can we get ? ' and in a sense , the sky is the limit -- excuse the pun -- for what you can sell on board , " says @entity21			2
mainly , though , he notes that it 's the tried - and - true that entice customers the most			0
" really , passengers will spend on something that enhances their trip , and means something to them because of the experience they 're in at the moment			0
it 's hard to imagine them going on board and buying a sofa that will be delivered back to their apartment			0
" the odd factor for many years , airlines left the quirkier retail offering to @entity100 , the quarterly in - flight catalog available on almost all domestic flights in the @entity104			1
an old business model ( the company is nearing its 25th anniversary ) , @entity100 has recently had to contend with the more aggressive retail strategies employed by many airlines , as well as distracting new technology ; iphones in the air mean travelers are less dependent on the catalog for entertainment			2
the company , which has made a name for itself by proffering off - kilter items ( the garden yeti and remote - control @entity121 robot are long - standing best - sellers ) , has recently started to adapt its business model , putting even more focus on quirky products			0
@entity100 is also in the process of launching a mobile app. " one of the larger shifts in the last several years is we 've become extremely product - centric , " says @entity128 , @entity100 's director of merchandizing			0
" we want to be proactive in finding what 's new and unique			0
to that end , we 've been going to a lot more trade shows , searching the globe for those new products			0
" some of its biggest sellers , notes @entity128 , are sports paraphernalia and pet products			0
though he says @entity100 's customer base appreciates functionality , it 's some of the stranger and more original products that capture the imagination			0
" first , we look at products that are new to market , or solve problems			0
then , we look for those social - media type products that our marketing team can have a lot of fun with , " he adds .			0

to make money , airlines are *pushing* everything from craft beer to cars
in *addition* to @entity165 , @entity38 sells branded shoes
@entity38 was also the first airline to accept @entity57 for payment
