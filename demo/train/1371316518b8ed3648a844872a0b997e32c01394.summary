the @entity0 did all they could to make their @entity3 captives faceless , dressing them in uniforms and tattooing them with numbers that would become their new identities			0
in the midst of that horror -- indeed , in perhaps the most horrific place a @entity3 could land at the time -- prisoners sought to take their images back and made sure that art was still present			1
@entity14 , a @entity15 artist and political prisoner at @entity17 , made portraits of fellow prisoners			1
though the portraits portrayed prisoners of various nationalities and ages , they shared the same haunting quality , according to @entity26 , an art historian at the @entity27			1
" the most interesting in these portraits are eyes -- a very strange helplessness , " she says			0
" prisoners created portraits because the desire to have an image was very strong			1
" @entity26 believes @entity14 made the portraits because he was aware they would one day become important historical documents			0
almost every portrait features the subject 's prisoner number , which gives historians a name to attach to the pictures			0
an earlier version of this story included a reference to " @entity15 camps			2
" it should have said " nazi concentration camps in @entity50 - occupied @entity15			1
" @entity1 regrets the error			0
more than 100 of @entity14 's portraits are housed in the @entity27 museum , a memorial and museum at the site of the @entity58 concentration camps in @entity50 - occupied @entity15			1
the gallery has more than 2,000 pieces of art created inside various @entity58 camps or after the war			1
through the years , @entity14 is said to have hidden his portraits in his bed or in his clothes			0
the drawings managed to survive until he was liberated			0
after his death in 1946 , his family donated his portraits to the museum			0
one of the most important pieces in the museum collection is a sketchbook containing 22 pictures most likely drawn in 1943 by an unknown prisoner at @entity17			1
the sketchbook is the only artwork documenting extermination at @entity27			1
the sketches were found in 1947 , two years after liberation , near @entity27 's crematoriums			1
they had been stuffed into a bottle and hidden in the foundations of one of the buildings			0
" some would be surprised that art existed in a place like that , in a place with crematories , but art was especially needed here behind the barbed wire , because the art could save a part of their human dignity , " says @entity26			2
" the art was a hope for a better future			2
the art was escape from the brutal reality of the camp to another , better world			2
" according to @entity26 , @entity108 officers commissioned some of the works			2
artistically gifted prisoners made instructional drawings and models for the military			0
@entity108 soldiers also exploited the prisoners ' talents for private purposes , making them create portraits , landscapes , greeting cards and illustrations of @entity50 legends			1
soldiers sent some of the art to their families or displayed it in the camp 's own gallery , the @entity130			0
that museum also held items taken from those deported to the camp , including antiques , @entity3 prayer books and garments			0
for @entity26 , the most valuable and important work is the art prisoners made at great risk -- in secret			1
" prisoners could n't use materials from @entity108 officers for private purposes			0
it was forbidden , but prisoners many times carried out illegal activity and used these materials for illegal artworks , " she says , " these paintings and drawings play a very important educational role as illustrative of what happened at @entity17			1
" prisoners made art using whatever materials they could find -- scraps of paper , baking paper , the backs of old letters			2
they made sculptures using bread and toothbrushes , says @entity26			0
" the art was forbidden in @entity17 so creating a drawing like that means risking torture , even death , however the art existed here almost from the beginning , " she says			1
@entity175 was a @entity15 @entity176 arrested while crossing the border in attempt to reach the newly formed @entity179 in @entity180			0
he had escaped @entity17 once , but was rearrested in @entity181			2
after he was liberated , he immigrated to the @entity182 , became a @entity182 citizen , and worked for the @entity185 newspaper as an illustrator			0
before he passed away in 2002 , he painted works depicting daily life in the camp -- scenes of barbarity at the hands of the @entity108 and humanity and compassion between fellow prisoners			2
" thanks to these artworks , we could also see @entity17 and the camp in the eyes of prisoners			1
and this is very unique because we have n't photos depicting everyday life of prisoners in the camp , " says @entity26			0
through these works , she says , we can see the truth about @entity17 .			1

@entity27 has works of art created in concentration camps
prisoners would create art in secret and hide it
through these works , we can see the truth about @entity17 , historian says
