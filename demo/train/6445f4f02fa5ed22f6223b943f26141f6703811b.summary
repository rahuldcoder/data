" @entity6 said the day his unit came under attack was quiet and started out like any other day in @entity21			1
" we are all soldiers and we are all out on a mission , " he said			2
@entity6 , 25 , was a specialist serving with the @entity24 on his second tour of duty in @entity21 when his unit was attacked on the night of october 25 , 2007			1
he recalls himself as an average soldier , saying he did n't do anything that someone else would n't have done			2
according to @entity31 documents seen by @entity1 , @entity6 and his fellow soldiers were walking back to base along the top of a mountain ridge when the enemy attacked from their front and their left			1
@entity43 fighters barraged the @entity44 with ak - 47s , rocket propelled grenades and @entity49 era large machine guns			2
@entity6 saw several of his fellow soldiers go down			1
he ran forward throwing grenades and returning enemy fire to help one soldier who had been shot but was still fighting			0
then he noticed one of the wounded soldiers was missing			0
he ran over a hill where moments before @entity43 fighters were shooting at him to find his wounded friend , sgt. @entity57			2

@entity6 said his actions were not something he thought about but something he was trained to do			1
" after the medevac bird comes in and starts picking people up , it 's not over , you 're not out of @entity21 , you 're not off the side of the mountain , you 're just minus some buddies and there 's no time to talk , you still have to complete the mission , " he said			2
