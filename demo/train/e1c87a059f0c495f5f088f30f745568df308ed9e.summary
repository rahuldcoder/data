@entity0 -- a high - frequency radar in @entity5 detected the march 11 tsunami that devastated @entity7 , raising hopes for the development of a new early warning system , a @entity3 oceanographer said			1
it was the first time a tsunami has been observed on radar , said professor @entity14 , an oceanographer at the @entity3 and an author of a new paper describing the work			1
" we have the hardware set up			0
we have the system operational			0
it 's a software challenge that we show we can achieve " for the @entity22 , @entity14 told @entity1 tuesday			2
his paper appears this month in the journal @entity25			0
a consortium of universities in @entity5 already has a high - frequency radar system set up for the @entity22 to detect changes in the ocean 's currents			1
to develop an early warning system for tsunamis on the @entity22 , software would be needed , @entity14 said			2
such a detection system could provide a 15 - minute warning for a tsunami approaching northern @entity5 and an early warning of an hour for southern @entity5 , where the shallow continental shelf along the coast is bigger , @entity14 said			2
the @entity42 @entity41 and southeast @entity43 would have to set up a system and software from scratch , but an early detection system could provide an hour 's warning for the @entity41 and several hours for @entity43 , where the coastal shallow waters are much bigger , @entity14 said			1
for the past decade , @entity14 and his colleagues have used a high - frequency radar array at the university 's @entity52 to study ocean currents off @entity5			1
that radar array is state - funded , but researchers are concerned about the costs of continuing to operate it , @entity14 said			0
researchers from @entity61 and @entity62 universities in @entity7 and @entity63 and @entity14 used data from radar sites at @entity66 ; @entity67 , @entity5 ; and two sites in @entity61 , @entity7 , to look for the tsunami offshore			1
the radar does n't pick up the actual tsunami but rather changes in currents as the wave travels , the scientists said			0
as the waves enter shallower coastal water over the continental shelf , they slow down , increase in height and decrease in wavelength , the scientists said .			0

a tsunami has been observed for the first time on radar , an oceanographer says
that was the march 11 tsunami that devastated @entity7
the @entity22 already has a high - frequency radar system for the ocean
@entity43 , parts of the @entity42 @entity41 would have to build radar systems from scratch
