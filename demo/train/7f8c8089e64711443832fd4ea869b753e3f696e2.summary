-- prince @entity1 and @entity2 have never been the stay - at - home types			1
a traveler could plan a royal ( and royally expensive ) getaway just following in their footsteps			2
the couple has journeyed to some of the world 's most luxurious spots			1
here are five places to catch the flavor of a royal vacation			1
@entity15 , @entity16 @entity2 and @entity1 rekindled their romance here with a getaway in 2007			1
the private , three - mile - long @entity22 coral atoll is surrounded by clear turquoise water , and is reached by private plane			2
the five - bedroom @entity25 would seem perfect for the honeymooners , but others can book a beachfront suite for a mere $ 1,000 per person per night			0
http://www.desroches-island.com / @entity32 , @entity33 what better place to soak up royal romance than the spot where @entity37 finally popped the question ? the 65,000 - acre conservancy is home to the world 's largest population of the endangered @entity44 's zebra			1
but do n't think the royal couple was roughing it			0
camp " tents " have thatched roofs , verandas and bathrooms , and are arrayed around a central lounge with swimming pool			0
there 's also a masseuse to work out those post-safari knots			1
all - inclusive nightly rates begin at $ 320			0
@entity57 / @entity58 , @entity59 the royal couple 's first official trip will be to @entity59 , but it wo n't be all business			1
it 's believed the active pair will end their trip in @entity69 's @entity68 , following in the steps of @entity1 's grandmother , great aunt and great grandmother , all of whom have stayed at the @entity58 's six - bedroom @entity76 -- the so - called @entity78			1
( cost from $ 2,600 to $ 6,200 per night			0
) the rest of us can at least enjoy the resort 's view over @entity83			2
@entity84 , @entity85 @entity1 's bride seems to be a beach girl at heart , and this 1,400 - acre private island has been her getaway of choice in recent years			2
visitors wo n't be checking into a @entity93 , though			0
rental villas fill nearly the entire island			0
for a touch of royalty , kick - back in five - bedroom @entity99 , which once belonged to @entity100			2
weekly rentals run from $ 18,000 to $ 28,000			0
duchy of @entity103 , @entity104 @entity2 and her family spent @entity106 2009 at her future father - in - law 's place , the 133,000 - acre @entity102 of @entity103			1
the @entity109 stayed in the recently updated , 500 - year - old @entity110 , which sleeps 18 and has a tennis court and heated swimming pool			0
rates run from $ 1,625 to $ 5,700 per night , and you will be doing your part to finance the royal wedding : the @entity102 helps support the @entity118 and his family .			0
