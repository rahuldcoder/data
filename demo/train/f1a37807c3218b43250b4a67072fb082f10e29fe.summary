@entity0 -- the @entity2 on wednesday began sending out to troops a survey of more than 100 questions seeking their views on the impact of repealing the " do n't ask , do n't tell " restrictions prohibiting gays and lesbians from openly serving in the @entity12 military			1
an administration official confirmed to @entity1 that the survey is being sent to 200,000 active duty troops and 200,000 reserve troops			1
the official declined to be identified because the survey has not officially been made public			0
the survey , which service members can expect to receive via e-mail , asks about such issues as how unit morale or readiness might be affected if a commander is believed to be gay or lesbian ; the need to maintain personal standards of conduct ; and how repeal might affect willingness to serve in the military			1
the survey also asks a number of questions aimed at identifying problems that could occur when troops live and work in close quarters in overseas war zones			2
for example , the questionnaire asks military members how they would react if they had to share a room , bathrooms , and open - bay showers in a war zone with other service members believed to be gay or lesbian			0
there also are several questions about reactions to dealing with same - sex partners in social situations			0
the @entity2 established a team to conduct the survey earlier this year			2
president @entity55 , defense secretary @entity56 , and @entity58 chairman adm. @entity57 have all publicly backed a repeal of the current policy			2
@entity2 officials insist the survey is aimed at determining the impact of a repeal -- not whether repeal should happen			1
several members of the @entity58 have said they want to see the results of the survey before they offer their final advice on the impact of a repeal to @entity55 and @entity56			1
in may , the @entity71 approved a plan that would repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy after the military 's internal review is completed and @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57 to sign off on the policy change			1
the @entity77 , however , did not pass the measure			0
according to a senior @entity12 military official with direct knowledge of the review process , the military needs until the end of 2010 to figure out how to implement a repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell " in terms of housing , medical and marriage benefits , as well as issues involving the reinstatement of gay soldiers previously discharged under the policy			0
a major problem might be determining how to reconcile the repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell " with federal law that defines marriage as between a man a woman , the official said			0
in addition to distributing the survey , the @entity2 has also been soliciting opinions in a number of private meetings with troops			1
the results of the review will not be available until december , the official said			0
@entity1 's @entity106 contributed to this report			0
