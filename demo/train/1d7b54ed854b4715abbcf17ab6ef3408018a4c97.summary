" state - run @entity12 said wednesday that @entity1 spoke in an interview after his escape , telling the channel , " i think i will be unable to get into details during this limited period of time and i will postpone it to when i am hopefully in my dear country @entity7 , so i can speak to the media and my own people with ease of mind and tell them about my ordeal over the past 14 months			1
" @entity1 has left the @entity5 and is headed back to @entity7 , the country 's state - run media said wednesday morning			1
" following the @entity28 's efforts and with the effective cooperation of the embassy of @entity31 in @entity32 ... @entity1 left the @entity5 and will arrive in @entity3 via a third country , " the news agency , @entity33 , reported -- quoting a foreign ministry spokesman			1
@entity1 , who is a researcher from @entity3 's @entity37 , mysteriously disappeared in june 2009 while on a religious pilgrimage to @entity39 , according to @entity7 media reports			1
on monday , @entity1 went to @entity7 's @entity41 at the @entity42 in @entity32 and asked to be sent home			1

@entity74 , a member of @entity7 parliament 's @entity76 and @entity75 , said @entity7 officials had turned over the documents to the @entity80 ambassador in @entity3			2
the @entity81 has denied that charge			0
a @entity5 official , who is not authorized to talk to the media about such issues , told @entity0 last month that it would be " ludicrous , absurd and even preposterous " to claim an individual was kidnapped by the @entity5 and held against his will			2

" i am @entity1 , the son of the @entity28 of @entity7 , who with @entity106 's help succeeded in running away from the @entity5 security agents in the state of @entity94			1
i am [ temporarily ] at a safe place and i am trying to do this video but it is quite possible that i may shortly be again arrested by @entity5 security agents			0
" he went on to say : " i am not free here and not allowed to contact my family or other people			0
if i face any problems or if i do not return to my country soon , the government of the @entity5 would be directly responsible for it			0
" @entity0 could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos , nor the identity of the man in them			0
" if he is who people think he is , the @entity5 would be in contact with the person , " a @entity72 official said last month			0
and if he were being held against his will , " how would he have been able to produce any of the videos ? " the official said			0
in the second video that surfaced june 30 and dated june 23 , the man claiming to be @entity1 reassures his family about his well - being			2
" i want to let my beloved family know that i am ok and they should not worry about my health , " he says			0

i want them to be , as always , strong and patient and to pray for my safe return			0
