-- the @entity1 and @entity2 are taking on @entity4 militants on the land and from the air amid fears that @entity8 is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished @entity12 country			1
@entity2 government forces are trying to wrest the southern town of @entity15 from @entity4 militants , and an @entity1 official said @entity1 military - led airstrikes have resumed and top insurgents have been killed			1
@entity1 drone strikes had been conducted in the past in @entity2 , but they had paused amid the unrest			2
@entity0 national security contributor @entity24 , a former @entity24 homeland security adviser , said the current airstrikes are an " indication of the strength and confidence " president @entity30 has in the @entity31 , which directs the strikes			0
" i think it 's a resumption , " @entity24 said of the airstrikes			0
" and i do think it appears to be an intensification			0
some of that may be based on the threat environment and better intelligence			0
" widespread tumult has engulfed @entity2 for months , with thousands of demonstrators who oppose the rule of president @entity44 urging the president 's departure			1
in recent weeks , anti-government tribal forces have battled with troops , and last friday , the presidential compound was attacked , injuring @entity44 and other senior officials , who were taken to @entity51 for treatment			2
a six - nation @entity55 @entity54 alliance has tried to broker a government - opposition agreement that would lead to @entity44 's departure , a move that could end the conflict			2
that initiative has fallen through , but efforts have re-emerged to end differences			0
state - run tv reported on thursday that " the deputy ministry of information calls upon the brethren in the opposition to arise to a level of positive thinking that will heal the wounds and restore the trust among all the players of the political process			1
" but @entity44 long has been mired in another struggle -- the fight against @entity8 in the @entity75 , @entity8 's @entity2 wing , and he has been a key ally of the @entity1 in the fight against the militant group			1
" the @entity2 government has a strong partnership with the @entity1 government , especially in the field of counterterrorism , " said a @entity2 government official who has asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media			1
both @entity2 and the @entity1 have envisioned a nightmare scenario of @entity86 taking advantage of the civil strife and exploiting the absence of @entity44 and other top officials			1
a @entity1 military official with knowledge of the @entity2 campaign told @entity0 that @entity1 military - led air operations recently resumed after a pause of some months and a top militant may have been killed			1
@entity98 , " described as one of the most dangerous @entity8 commanders in @entity103 province , " has been killed in @entity2 security operations , state - run tv reported thursday , citing an official military source			1
the @entity105 reported thursday that @entity1 jets killed @entity98 in an airstrike last friday			2
the @entity1 official also said the @entity1 believes it probably killed @entity98 in an airstrike in southern @entity2 in recent days			1
but he cautioned its " very difficult " to confirm the killing			0
that official said the @entity1 had paused airstrikes because it " did n't have faith in the information available , " to target individuals in @entity2 during that time			1
but the official could not say what led to the improved intelligence picture			0
last month , a @entity1 drone strike attempted but failed to kill @entity120 , the @entity1 - born radical @entity4 cleric who moved to @entity2 and has become a key figure in @entity86			1
that attack came after the @entity1 military swooped into a compound in @entity125 , @entity126 , on may 2 , and killed @entity8 leader @entity127			1
@entity24 said @entity86 is dangerous and the administration is rightly concerned , noting that the chaos in @entity2 " benefits our enemies and not us			2
" the official @entity2 source cited by state tv reported other deaths in security operations , such as " the killing of various commanders and members of @entity8 in @entity139 province			1
" people killed in operations included the " media official of the organization , @entity144 , and the terrorist @entity145 , the commander of the organization in @entity148 province			0
" meanwhile , fighting continued in @entity15 , an @entity139 province town that had been taken over by militants			2
the state tv report said the government had ousted militants from the town			0
" the heroes of the armed forces and with the help of the noble residents managed to clear the city of @entity15 and caused @entity8 serious losses in lives and weaponry , " the state - run tv report said			1
earlier , a senior security official loyal to the @entity2 government told @entity0 that nine @entity4 militants and four @entity2 soldiers were killed in clashes overnight in @entity15			1
medical officials in @entity171 near @entity15 said thursday that more than 40 people entered the hospital , all with wounds from bullets of explosives			2
" dead bodies are still in the streets of @entity15 , but residents have evacuated the city , leaving those injured with no one to take them to the hospital , " a medic at the hospital said			0
recently , a @entity1 official told @entity0 that @entity86 is trying to position itself for greater power and influence , a sign of an evolving power struggle in the militant group since the killing of @entity127			2
" they are using the death of @entity127 as a way to bolster their own image , " the @entity1 official told @entity0			2
the source declined to be identified because of the sensitive intelligence information that has led to this assessment			0
there 's a strong @entity86 presence in @entity139 , and the @entity1 has long felt that the group is a growing threat			0
" they are clearly trying to improve their capabilities , " as they were even before @entity127 's death , the official said			0
he noted the death of @entity127 , coming on the heels of the growing civil unrest in @entity2 , gives the group the opportunity to both bolster its image and operate more freely			0
" we have seen a steady progression of @entity8 presence in @entity2 and efforts by them to organize and become more efficient , " the official said			1
as for @entity44 -- wounded when the mosque at the presidential compound in @entity220 was attacked during friday prayers -- @entity222 , the ruling party spokesmen , said the president will be back in @entity2 " within days and is now in very good health			1
" the future of @entity2 's government remains in question			0
" we do n't know who will emerge in power , " said @entity229 , who holds the @entity231 chair in strategy at the @entity233			0
" we do n't know what kind of power vacuum will exist " and how much it can be exploited , he said			0
" we 're not likely to see a stable @entity2 in the near future			0
" @entity0 's @entity240 contributed to this report			0
