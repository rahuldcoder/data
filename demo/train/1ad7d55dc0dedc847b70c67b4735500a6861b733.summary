@entity0 -- @entity4 @entity3 leaders are aiming to delay a challenge to president @entity9 's controversial immigration executive order until early next year in an effort to avoid a government shutdown next week , multiple @entity4 @entity3 members and aides told @entity1			1
speaker @entity12 announced the strategy in a closed - door meeting of @entity4 republicans tuesday , where it was largely well - received by rank and file @entity3 members , although some conservatives are pressing for changes , according to multiple sources			1
many members say they are still reviewing the details			0
at a news conference afterwards , @entity12 said his members realize their hands are tied on the immigration issue until @entity3 control both chambers of @entity28 in january			1
" i think they understand that it 's going to be difficult to take meaningful action as long as we got @entity34 control of the @entity35 , " @entity12 said			0
@entity36 , the @entity37 @entity3 in line to become the next @entity35 majority leader , reiterated his view that the @entity3 should stop threatening shutdowns			1
" we need to quit that kind of rattling the economy , " @entity42 said tuesday at the @entity44 ceo council			0
the government will run out of money on dec. 11 unless @entity28 acts			1
last year 's government shutdown was politically disastrous for @entity3 and the party is trying to avoid a repeat just as they 're on the cusp of retaking full control of @entity28 for the first time in nearly a decade			1
the @entity3 plan discussed on tuesday calls for the @entity4 to vote on legislation that would fund most of the government through september while only funding the @entity59 , which would carry out key parts of the executive orders , until just sometime in march			1
that would give republicans time to pass legislation blocking the immigration orders			0
@entity4 @entity3 leaders are trying to balance competing priorities in the party			1
they want to mollify conservatives who are furious over the president 's decision to make it easier for millions of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country by providing a clear opportunity for them to try to block the action			2
after hearing about the plan tuesday morning , some of those @entity4 members on the right say they will oppose it because it would continue funding for agencies tasked with granting new visas through march of next year			2
" you just want me to fund the unconstitutional act for 60 days ? kind of like being a little bit pregnant ? it does n't work for me , " @entity92 @entity91 told reporters			2
but other @entity3 -- including leaders in both chambers -- are fearful of tying that move to government funding			1
@entity100 @entity3 rep. @entity99 said now that voters gave his party control of both the @entity4 and @entity35 in the midterms it 's was important to demonstrate that they can govern and not " give any opportunity for buyer 's remorse on the part of the discerning electorate			1
" he said there was a " narrow window " for republicans to show they can run the government before voters size up the parties again before the 2016 election			2
a vote on the bill is likely next week , aides said			1
testifying before a @entity121 on tuesday , homeland security secretary @entity120 urged lawmakers against legislation that would fund his department for a shorter period of time than the rest of the government			0
" that is , in my judgment , a very bad idea for @entity59 because during that period ... , we can not engage in new starts , " @entity120 said			0
" for example , we are back in a presidential election cycle			0
i can not hire new @entity136 agents until i get an appropriations bill passed by this @entity28 -- not another ( continuing resolution ) for a couple of months			1
" @entity140 generally support the president 's immigration orders and oppose the @entity4 plan to fund @entity59 just through march			0
but after meeting with his caucus tuesday , @entity146 @entity145 it would be a " big accomplishment " if the @entity4 passed a bill that funded most of the government and signaled he would support it			0
separately , the @entity4 likely will vote this week on a bill that essentially calls out @entity9 on immigration			2
@entity154 chairman @entity153 is reworking a proposal drafted by @entity156 @entity3 rep. @entity3 of @entity156			2
that bill would allow members to " vent " about their unhappiness with the executive action and assert that what @entity9 did was unconstitutional			0
@entity163 @entity162 rep. @entity162 said the separate vote declaring the president violated the @entity166 by using executive authority on immigration is to demonstrate to constituents that the @entity3 opposed the president 's actions			1
" silence is assent so to not respond in any way is in some fashion to be complicit in it , so this allows members to be on the record and clear about it			0
" however , the bill would have not legal binding authority and the @entity35 is sure to ignore it			0
@entity91 said he would vote for the bill because he opposed the president 's immigration actions , but then he essentially dismissed it , saying , " it 's not going to go anywhere and everyone 's knows it			0
" in addition to the funding strategy , @entity4 @entity3 members are also still considering whether they should sue the president for the issuing the directives that they consider unconstitutional			2
@entity1 's @entity194 and @entity195 contributed to this story			0
