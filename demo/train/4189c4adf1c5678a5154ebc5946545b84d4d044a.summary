@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 countries should invest in broadband infrastructure to improve the welfare of their people , according to @entity8 , co-founder and ceo of @entity10 , the global it services provider			1
the @entity12 entrepreneur , who is often described as @entity12 's equivalent to @entity14 , said access to information will be critical in solving many of the continent 's problems			1
" i 've a very strong belief that @entity4 should take a leadership position in putting up broadband right down to every village and you 'll see the change , " he said			2
" if you give people information you can actually transform @entity4			0
" @entity8 was co-chair of the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) in @entity0 , @entity1 last may			0
with the theme " rethinking @entity4 's @entity37 , " @entity29 's summit focused on the continent 's relationship with major economic partners and looked at its options for a sustainable future			1
in 1976 , @entity8 co-founded @entity10 in a @entity39 garage , along with five others deployed emerging microprocessor technology to create @entity12 's first personal computer			1
he urged @entity4 nations to connect to each other in a similar way to the @entity46			1
" your power to negotiate becomes better if you all come together , " he said			0
connectivity is a familiar issue for mr @entity8			0
his company , which has now grown to become a global enterprise , with 65,000 employees , has been awarded a major contract by the @entity12 government to implement " pan-africa " -- a networking project that will enable @entity4 's 53 heads of state to communicate over videoconferencing			1
mr @entity8 spoke to @entity2 about the business ties between @entity12 and @entity4 and his company 's expansion plans			1
@entity2 : is @entity12 really eyeing @entity4 as an investment opportunity ? @entity8 : there are many traditional links between @entity4 and @entity12 , for more than 40 years			1
if you look at 1949 , local currency here in @entity1 was the @entity12 rupee			0
a lot of @entity4 have gone to @entity12 to study and for medical tourism , because we have great medical facilities			1
our prime minister enjoys also deep connects with different heads of state in @entity4 , so there 's a lot of interest both from the private sector and the government			1
@entity2 : what do @entity12 companies gain by working in @entity4 ? obviously money is the ultimate end but what specifics can they get from @entity4 ? @entity88 : it 's a question of a billion @entity12 people and a billion @entity4 people -- the problems and solutions in @entity12 are absolutely the same as in @entity4			1
so if you actually create products for @entity12 they can definitely be sold into @entity4 and similar solutions can be created			2
@entity2 : what 's the importance of the @entity101 trade ? have you seen a difference in the past few years ? @entity88 : yes , there is a deep shift taking place and @entity12 specifically is very interested in growing its ties with @entity4 in many ways			1
there 's a whole bunch of @entity12 companies that have actually come and set - up training centers in @entity4 and more are coming in			1
@entity2 : the subcontinent is often lauded for where it 's come from and where it 's now			0
why has @entity4 struggled to match ? you said @entity12 has a billion people , @entity4 has a billion people			2
where is that disconnect happening ? @entity88 : its ' probably the fact that @entity12 is one country -- in @entity4 you are looking at 50 odd countries so obviously there are rules , regulations , governments that are different -- that 's really @entity4 's challenge			1
but if all of @entity4 comes together , pretty much like what 's happening in @entity132 , then i think the whole situation will change and they can actually bargain better for cooperation with other parts of the world			2
your power to negotiate becomes better if you all come together			0
@entity2 : what challenges have you come across in your investments in @entity4 ? @entity88 : we have n't really found any great challenges , because for us the conditions are so similar			0
we are quite used to diversity because in @entity12 , although it 's one country , there are 30 different states			2
plus , what we 've seen is a lot of trust between @entity4 and @entity12 because of what 's happened in the past			1
@entity2 : what can @entity4 provide to @entity12 companies , other than just markets ? @entity88 : markets are of course very important , but one of the areas we would be looking at is to have other locations to work out from			2
so maybe one day when we do n't want to do some of the outsourcing work that we do for the @entity165 , @entity166 or @entity132 companies , then maybe we can actually partner with @entity4 companies to actually deliver			0
@entity2 : @entity4 has been long settled with the reputation of providing minerals and raw products			0
do you think there is hope for manufacturing and skills now ? @entity88 : definitely manufacturing because you have to look at your domestic market			0
@entity12 emerged out of the problems in the last years pretty much unscathed , because we have a huge domestic market			0
but the one area where @entity4 can make a big difference is by not just looking at putting up roads -- it should look at putting up internet broadband - type infrastructure			2
one question i 've always answered is why are the poor , poor			0
the reason why is because they do n't have information			0
if you give people information you can actually transform @entity4			0
i 've a very strong belief that @entity4 should take a leadership position in putting up broadband right down to every village and you 'll see the change			2
if you actually make something like that happen in @entity4 , the continent will be transformed .			0
