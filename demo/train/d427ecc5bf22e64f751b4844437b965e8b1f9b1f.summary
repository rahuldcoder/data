-- on november 7 , @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , became the latest addition to the national park family			2
after a long fight by @entity2 residents and officials to have the 77 - foot waterfall recognized , their dreams were fulfilled -- partially -- by monday 's agreement			1
there remain years of work to mold @entity1 around @entity16 standards , but the will , and the funds , can now be brought fully to bear on the project			1
@entity20 : see the parks when @entity23 declared @entity26 the country 's first national park in 1872 , early conservationists could have only dreamed of the vast network of protected areas that grace @entity30 's states and territories today			1
less than 140 years after @entity26 's induction , the @entity16 now operates 397 parks and monuments			1
@entity1 might be years away from completion , but visitors have 396 other options to explore in the meantime			0
and there 's no better time for a park jaunt than this @entity42 weekend , when over 100 national parks will waive their entrance fees			1
from november 11 - 13 , explorers can enjoy the beauty and history of national parks from @entity49 to @entity50 at no charge			1
( many other national parks are free throughout the year			1
) no doubt many visitors will take advantage of this largesse to visit @entity26 , the @entity56 and other crown jewels of the @entity16 , but there are worlds of wonder beyond the well - trodden path			1
why not take a chance on one of the @entity16 's more unusual and lesser - visited locales ? check out the following : @entity65 , @entity49			1
hot and remote , the @entity65 are one of the @entity16 's most inaccessible destinations			1
one thing they are n't is dry ; the seven islands lying seventy miles west of @entity72 received their name from their lack of terrestrial fresh water ( and an abundance of turtles ) , but tropical storms inundate the little archipelago with some regularity			0
visitors must take a ferry or seaplane to the park , but the reward is worth it : renowned for its marine life and snorkeling , the @entity65 offer clean beaches and clear water , as well as an historic @entity30 fortress to explore			0
best of all , you probably wo n't have to share it with many other people			0
@entity20 : 16 awe - inspiring @entity30 monuments @entity97 , @entity98			2
the @entity16 is n't exactly modest in its holdings : from the @entity100 , to @entity102 's @entity101 , to @entity103 -- @entity104 in @entity105 ( the reigning champ at over eight million acres ) , it has its share of massive parks			1
but these spaces contain enough to fill a lifetime , so they might not be the best choice for a weekend trip			2
if you 're not up for getting lost in a vast wilderness , why not go to the opposite extreme and visit the smallest destination in the @entity16 ? commemorating the life of an @entity30 @entity119 hero , this @entity116 includes exhibits and artifacts from @entity123 's military career in the new country he helped to liberate			1
housed within @entity123 's small @entity98 home and measuring in at only .02 acres , the memorial is perfect for a quick historical tour			2
only serious adventurers need apply for an expedition to @entity128 , a swath of land in southwest @entity105 encompassing the volcano that gives the park its name			0
extreme weather , a rugged , remote landscape and various other inconveniences -- like bears -- have earned @entity128 its place as the very bottom rung of the @entity16 popularity ladder , but the natural riches of wild @entity105 are a pot of gold for the few willing to seek out the end of this rainbow			2
sure , by the @entity16 's own estimates only a few dozen people make it out to @entity128 each year , but what an unforgettable experience those determined few must have			1
@entity20 : 8 most complicated countries to visit @entity153 , @entity154			0
from frontier @entity105 to the glittering streets of @entity154 , the @entity16 spans all environs			2
on the opposite end of the spectrum from @entity128 is the @entity153 , located in @entity159			0
the monument preserves the remains of several hundred free and enslaved @entity162 buried in the 17th and 18th centuries			0
the burial ground was forgotten and built over in subsequent centuries , only to resurface in 1991 as a result of construction excavations			0
a monument and visitor center now honor the memories of the interred			0
( @entity171 does not charge admission , but will be closed on @entity42			0
) @entity20 : 10 most interesting beaches @entity174 , @entity175			0
billed by the @entity16 as " the oldest and only remaining all @entity178 west of the @entity179 , " @entity176 was an important outpost for @entity181 moving westward after the @entity182			2
the historical site in @entity175 is comprised of several historic buildings within the still -- living community of modern @entity176			0
the town also hosts historical festivals at points throughout the year			0
many of the @entity16 's most popular monuments are dedicated to familiar figures of @entity30 history			1
@entity196 's three memorials alone attracted over six million visitors in 2010 -- a far cry from the @entity154 home of @entity200 , which received only around fifteen thousand visitors a year before closing for renovations in 2006			2
@entity190 was reopened in september and is now accepting visitors -- and at no charge			0
if @entity200 holds no interest for you , try another of the lesser - visited memorials dedicated to important @entity181 : the @entity211 in @entity212 , @entity213 , celebrates the life of the renowned landscape architect ; the @entity216 , @entity206 @entity205 remembers the storied career of the quintessentially @entity30 poet ; and in @entity220 , the @entity219 stands in remembrance of the early , determined civil rights activist and educator			1
