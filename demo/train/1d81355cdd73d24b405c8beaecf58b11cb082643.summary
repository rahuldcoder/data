-- hating the @entity1 is an @entity3 pastime that transcends political affiliation			1
this past may , disgust for the @entity1 reached an all - time high when @entity6 , director of the @entity1 's @entity7 , disclosed the agency had improperly targeted social welfare organizations seeking special status under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) of the tax code based on their political ideology			1
this revelation resulted in more than three months ( and counting ) of congressional hearings and investigations			0
read the @entity1 inspector general 's report on targeting but in typical @entity24 fashion , the manufactured congressional outrage and grandstanding has served to do little more than obfuscate the real scandal at the @entity1 : that the agency allows social welfare organizations to manipulate federal tax law by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on political ads. anyone who watched television in the lead - up to the 2010 and 2012 elections undoubtedly noticed the slew of vitriolic , misleading campaign ads. some of these ads were sponsored by federal candidates , but many more were produced by groups with innocuous sounding names -- such as @entity40 or the @entity41 -- but massive bank accounts			1
@entity40 , for example , a nonprofit organization cofounded by former @entity46 administration official @entity45 , spent more than $ 70 million on the 2012 election			0
like the groups targeted by the @entity1 , @entity40 is a section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organization , which affords certain tax benefits and -- most importantly -- the ability to keep the names of donors secret			1
federal law requires these groups to operate " exclusively for purposes beneficial to the community as a whole			0
" @entity1 regulations , however , create a loophole in the law by allowing groups " primarily " engaged in these types of activities to benefit from this tax status			1
many 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups have interpreted this regulation to mean they can spend up to 49 % of their funds on political activities -- mostly negative , deceptive political ads. adding to the confusion , the @entity1 has said there is no specific percentage the agency uses to gauge whether a group has engaged " primarily " in social welfare activities , but rather that it considers all facts and circumstances			1
what does that mean exactly ? no one knows			0
when directly confronted about the problem and the agency 's record of inaction , the @entity1 has said only that it is " aware " of the issue			2
but the @entity1 has been aware of and has chosen to ignore this problem for more than 50 years			1
if the agency had revised its regulations at any point in the past as my organization and others requested , the agency might have avoided the quagmire in which it is drowning			0
frustrated with the @entity1 's inaction , in may @entity100 filed a lawsuit against the @entity1 for flouting the law barring 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organizations from engaging in political activity			1
the case is pending in @entity24 district court			0
rep. @entity107 , @entity108 , and other public interest groups filed a similar lawsuit last month			0
because social welfare organizations are not required to disclose their donors , 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups have become the de facto vehicle for millionaires , billionaires , and even corporations who want to remain anonymous while influencing our elections			1
as a result , politically active nonprofit groups spent more than $ 300 million on the 2012 election			0
@entity3 should not only be outraged that our elections are being flooded with anonymous cash , but because of the nonprofit status of these groups , taxpayers are subsidizing their activity			0
with more and more groups seeking to participate in federal elections using money raised from donors who want to remain anonymous , applications to the @entity1 for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) status more than doubled between 2010 and 2012			2
to manage the deluge , @entity6 said the agency relied on code words and other shortcuts to single groups out for extra review			2
while the scrutiny of tea party groups has received the most attention , the @entity1 " be on the @entity144 " ( @entity143 ) list also included the words " progressive , " " occupy , " and " @entity149			2
" flagging any group for further screening because their applications included specific words or phrases was wrong			0
the impact , however , of such misguided actions on our democracy was negligible , particularly compared to that wrought by the @entity1 's failure to stop hundreds of millions of dollars from flooding our electoral system to influence our votes			1
for all of the abuse heaped upon the @entity1 and for all the concern about the @entity143 list , the same thing could happen again if the disparity between the language of the statute and regulation is not addressed			2
agents processing applications of groups seeking social welfare status in the future will remain as confused about the standards as those whose decisions have been questioned this year			1
nevertheless , @entity179 has shown no appetite to pass legislation clarifying the requirements for these nonprofit groups			2
as the 2014 election cycle gets under way , the super rich and corporations with deep coffers will continue to buy our elections , and @entity179 will continue to spend time and resources on a never - ending cycle of investigations into a problem with a fairly easy solution : as @entity179 intended when it first passed the law , prohibit 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organizations from spending money on anything other than social welfare activities			1
as long as members of @entity179 do nothing other than one - up each other 's disdain for the @entity1 , nothing will change			1
and that really is a scandal			0
