-- @entity1 was left frustrated after two lapses gave his rivals hope of stopping the @entity4 from running away with the biggest victory of his golf career in @entity8			1
the 29 - year - old will take a three - shot lead into the final round of the $ 8.5 million @entity13 tournament in @entity14 , but two double - bogeys -- the second at his last hole -- took the gloss off a six - under - par 66 peppered with 10 birdies			1
it meant that @entity22 's sparkling 63 in saturday 's third round put the @entity23 in an even better position to emulate @entity25 -- the only player to defend a @entity28 title			1
" i 'm still a little mad from my double - bogey on 18 , " @entity1 told reporters at @entity30			1
" obviously to have a three - shot lead going into the last day is good and i am looking forward to the challenge			2
i still have to play really well			0
" if you told me teeing off i would shoot six under i would have taken it , but i obviously left a few shots out there			0
i 'm definitely happy with what i shot			0
obviously i 'm just not happy with the way i finished			0
" @entity1 , who had led by five at the halfway stage of the co-sanctioned tournament , is seeking to add to his seven @entity43 victories , the last of which came in @entity45 in january			2
" making two doubles , there 's no excuse for that , " he said			0
" especially the way i 'm playing right now , it should n't happen			0
but 66 is still a good day and i did make 10 birdies , so i hit a lot of great shots			1
" @entity22 was second on 15 under , carding an eagle and eight birdies -- five of them in a row			2
" i guess the only blemish for me , which leaves a bit of a sour taste , was three - putting 17 , and actually missing a couple of opportunities , " said @entity22 , who is chasing the $ 1.2 million first prize to boost his hopes of reaching the @entity61 to @entity63 finale			1
this is the second of four events leading to the 60 - man shootout , with the standings headed by the @entity43 's @entity74 champion @entity73			1
the @entity75 was tied for 58th after his best round this week -- a 67 following 76 and 74			0
he could be overtaken by second - placed @entity77 , who is third in @entity14 after a 64 put him a shot behind @entity22			1
the @entity80 's only major win came at the @entity81 , where he hunted down @entity1 on the final day when the @entity4 @entity84 player also had a three - stroke advantage			1
" from here it looks like @entity1 is going to have to beat himself for anybody to have a chance to catch him , " @entity77 said			1
" race to @entity63 points will be very important to me ; i have a lot to play for tomorrow			2
if not the trophy , second place will certainly be worth my while			0
" former world no. 1 @entity95 shot 67 to be tied for fourth with @entity97 champion @entity96 and @entity99 @entity98 , who both carded 65			0
@entity101 , another player who has topped the rankings , climbed to a tie for seventh with former masters champion @entity105 and another @entity4 , @entity106			2
the @entity107 had been on course for the holy grail of 59 , but had to settle for 62 after parring his last three holes			0
@entity113 @entity97 champion @entity112 was tied for 22nd after a three - bogey , three - birdie 72			0
masters titleholder @entity114 is back home ahead of next week 's @entity118 pga , while world no. 1 @entity25 will return to action for the third race to @entity123 event in @entity124 .			2
