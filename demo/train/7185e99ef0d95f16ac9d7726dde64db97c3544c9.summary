-- fans from across @entity2 will soon be traveling to @entity3 to support their teams during @entity5 , but so too will police officers from each nation to keep an eye on them			1
when their national teams are playing , visiting police officers will be at @entity3 's police headquarters in @entity12 , the nerve - center for security operations during the event			1
@entity3 has a lot riding on the tournament it is co-hosting with @entity19 , and is no stranger to football violence			1
last year 's @entity22 between @entity23 and @entity24 was a high - profile example of how domestic football in @entity3 is still blighted by hooliganism , as violent fans clashed with police and water cannons had to be used to control the crowd			1
even before that incident , @entity32 , @entity2 football 's governing body , had criticized @entity3 for football violence which it said was ruining the country 's reputation			2
however police in the capital have spent years preparing for @entity5 and reducing the potential of trouble from homegrown and international football hooligans			1
like all major international events terrorism is the main security concern			2
" the whole security plan is ready ; the right equipment has been bought , " says @entity45 , press officer for the @entity3 police force			1
" the sites that needed to be renovated for the tournament have also been completed			0
and now it 's a time to put all that we have done into practice			0
" the new @entity54 in @entity12 hosted a friendly match between @entity3 and @entity56 in february this year , when the local police force was able to test their readiness			2
it was called a success by @entity32			0
" we know what we deliver has to be the best , at the top level , " says @entity62 , @entity3 's deputy foreign minister			1
" we are absolutely the best prepared for @entity5 and welcome everybody who wants not only to see football games , but also to see how hospitable we are and how beautiful the country is			0
" @entity3 is following on from lessons learned at recent big @entity2 tournaments , like @entity71 in @entity72 and @entity73 , and @entity75 's staging of the @entity76 in 2006			0
there will be " fan zones " with big screens and entertainment dotted around the major cities , where traveling fans without tickets can watch the matches			0
