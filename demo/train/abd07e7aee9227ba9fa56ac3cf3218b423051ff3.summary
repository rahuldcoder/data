-- twenty - five years ago i read a newspaper article which said that one day , reused syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of @entity7			1
i thought this was totally unacceptable and decided to do something about it			2
sadly , it 's come true			0
the toll from the reuse of syringes now exceeds that of malaria , with deaths due to this practice estimated at about 1.3 million each year			1
every 24 seconds a child dies as a result of receiving an unsafe injection			0
the transmission method is crude -- blood - borne viruses are transmitted from patient to patient as body fluid is transferred by reusing a needle and syringe multiple times			1
in 1984 i was living in the @entity30 , sailing on yachts , almost waiting for inspiration			0
then on a visit home , i read the article predicting the problem and my life changed instantly			0
for about 30 months , i studied all the areas related to the subject , and then it was clear what the ideal solution needed to be			0
my invention , the @entity42 ( @entity44 ) syringe , can only be used once and thereby helps stop the spread of blood - borne diseases such as @entity48 and @entity49			1
i set up @entity50 to globally license @entity51			0
fourteen licensees now distribute syringes to more than 70 countries , and from our sales figures , we can estimate that 9 million lives have been saved			1
this syringe is as cheap as all other standard syringes -- about 5 cents , a tenth of the cost of a @entity63 , to give you an idea -- but can only be used once and will lock and break if a doctor or nurse tries to reuse it			1
outside of our 14 licensees , there are another 10 factories producing single - use syringes in different designs around the world			1
but an invention is only a starting point for change , and so in 2006 i set up the @entity78 to generate awareness , petition for consistent regulation , and ensure compliance			0
( @entity78 takes care never to promote @entity84 , which would benefit @entity50 and its licensees			0
@entity78 does create awareness -- and so demand -- for @entity44 syringes on a generic basis , and our mission is aligned with others who wish to bring about global adoption of safe injection practices			2
) we are a small but expanding team , and are incredibly proud to have single - handedly rolled out one of the largest global health campaigns ever , reaching an audience of over 500 million people in @entity98 in november 2008			1
this unprecedented awareness campaign included 14 press conferences attended by 250 newspapers ; nationwide radio broadcasts ( more than 10,000 ) ; and short film screenings on television ( more than 5,000 ) and in 350 cinemas			0
it featured the moving story of @entity108 , a little boy who contracted @entity48 through a reused syringe			0
as a result of this campaign , the @entity110 made it mandatory for all government health facilities to use @entity44 syringes starting april 30 , 2009			1
to ensure continuing momentum and build on the awareness from the previous activity , another campaign will run in @entity98 in april 2010 , using shocking footage of syringes still being reused in some hospitals			1
we have a dedicated team in place that will launch a new campaign focused on @entity126 next year			2
taking the lessons learned from the experience in @entity98 , and then adapting the framework to suit the different audience and their preferred media , we will initially focus on @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			1
if an injection is given safely , there is no risk of further infection and therefore there are no additional costs linked to further treatment for secondary , treatment - caused infection			1
staff are happier and valuable bed space is kept free			0
hospital staff have reported to my team that for every $ 1 they spend on 20 ad syringes , they can expect , typically , to save $ 280			2
finally , i 'm working to launch a new and distinctive @entity152 logo			0
i 'm asking other @entity44 manufacturers to unite behind it and use it on their packaging , so that a safe injection can be immediately recognized , asked for and administered			0
needle reuse is , for all practical purposes , effectively murder on a global scale			2
medical practitioners are blindly giving unsafe injections because they do n't have the resources to do otherwise , or they simply do n't understand the consequences it can have			0
we need to push for change at the highest levels in society , government and right through to staff at the grassroots level			2
bring it on ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			1

reuse of syringes costs an estimated 1.3 million lives a year , @entity176 says
syringes can spread blood - borne diseases such as *hiv* and *hepatitis* , he says
@entity176 says low - cost syringes that can be used only once are produced
he says @entity98 has mandated use of auto - disable syringes in government facilities
