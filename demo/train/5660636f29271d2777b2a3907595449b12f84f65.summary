-- it could be the spartan living environment , or perhaps growing up in the thin air nearly 3,000 meters above sea level -- or maybe it 's the influence of a legendary local coach			0
whatever its secret , a remote mountain town in @entity8 has produced a string of world - beating distance runners			1
three - time @entity12 champion @entity11 is the current cream of a crop that has helped put @entity15 on the map			1
like many from her area , she was clearly born to run			0
" running is for me my job , but also my source of entertainment , " the 27 - year - old told @entity0 's @entity21 series			1
" it 's because of running that i am well known around the world			2
for me , it 's the ultimate thing			0
" her elder sister @entity29 was an @entity12 silver medalist in 2004 , while younger sister @entity32 was the 2009 world junior cross country champion and a younger brother @entity35 is a promising 800m runner			1
sporting excellence flows through the family genes : @entity11 is the cousin of double @entity12 10,000m champion @entity38 , while she was also inspired by another cousin -- @entity40 , who she often calls her sister , and was an international distance runner			1
they all hail from @entity15 , a town of fewer than 20,000 people set high in the mountains of the @entity49 province , but with a freakish record for track and field success			1
" @entity15 has produced so many great athletes starting from @entity53			2
in @entity56 , @entity54 ( @entity55 ) and i brought home two gold medals each , " @entity11 said			1
" @entity15 has strong runners			1
@entity15 is great and can produce even greater athletes			2
" it has echoes of @entity64 's @entity63 district , another rugged rural setting which has produced a string of sprint champions , including six - time olympic gold medalist @entity68			1
before @entity11 , the great @entity55 -- a three - time @entity12 champion and double world record - holder in the 5,000 and 10,000m -- was the most famous product of the area			1
both were coached by @entity74 in their important formative years			0
inspiring coach " @entity74 knew that my cousin @entity38 ran , he knows that my sisters ran too			1
that 's why he encouraged me to start running and used to tell me that i would be a great runner , he knew i would be a fast runner , " @entity11 said			1
success clearly breeds success -- the peak of which came at the @entity85 as @entity11 and @entity55 both won distance doubles -- and she believes the conveyor belt of talent will keep going			1
@entity55 has suffered injury problems since 2010 , and he had to settle for fourth in the 10,000m at @entity92 as his younger brother @entity93 chased home @entity96 's @entity95 and @entity97 of the @entity98 to claim a bronze medal			2
@entity11 was unable to repeat her @entity56 double , but became the first woman to retain an @entity12 10,000m title and took bronze in the 5,000m as @entity106 - born arch rival @entity105 won back the gold she first held in 2004			1
in addition , @entity11 has won four world championship golds and has also claimed the coveted world cross country title on four occasions , beating the best that @entity8 's great rivals @entity113 could produce			1
early struggles but despite her faultless pedigree , @entity11 's route to the top was not without its difficulties			1
she hoped to further both her education and her fledgling running career by moving to the capital of @entity106 , a grueling 276 - kilometer trip from @entity15			1
she was to live with her @entity40 and sister @entity29 , but missed the school registration deadline by six days			0
@entity40 , recognizing her cousin 's talent , instead enrolled the teenager into the sport club run by the @entity131 in @entity8			1
her early promise blossomed , and it was not long before @entity11 announced herself on the global stage by taking a surprise 5,000m gold at the 2003 world championships in @entity138 , still only 18 years of age			1
at the @entity140 in @entity141 , @entity11 was beaten into the bronze medal position in the 5000m by the more experienced @entity105 and @entity144 of @entity113 , a defeat which rankled despite her young years			2
" our country is not like other countries			0
silver and bronze in our country is no better than finishing fifth or sixth , " she said			0
winning gold at the @entity12 became the overriding goal for @entity11 , who underlined her dominance by winning the 5,000/10,000 double at the 2005 world championships and becoming the first woman to defend a 10,000m world title in @entity157 two years later			1
inspiring husband going into @entity56 , she was further inspired by @entity159 , whom she was to marry after the @entity160			0
@entity159 was twice a silver medal winner in the 10,000m , at the 2004 and @entity85 , and wanted his fiancee to go one better			0
" my husband @entity164 used to tell me that in order to become a great runner , you have to win the @entity12 gold , " she said			1
" when i said that i was tired and wo n't go to training , he would say work hard just for this one			0
" i did not believe then that i won my first @entity12 gold ( in the 10,000m )			1
it was a hard race , a tough race , i broke the @entity12 record , i broke the @entity175 record			2
" going into the 5,000m as the world record - holder , @entity11 sprinted to a golden @entity56 double , while @entity105 was third			2
with her main goal achieved , @entity11 concentrated on her wedding that november , when celebrations lasted over a week as the couple was feted in @entity8			1
she took a four - month break from intensive training and suffered as a consequence , sustaining injuries which she believed threatened her career			0
serious injury " i never thought i would return back to running again			0
i thought i had would never return to competition			0
i was under treatment , i spent a lot of time going back and forth to @entity193 for treatment , " @entity11 said			2
she was seeing renowned specialist @entity195 , who had to keep assuring @entity11 she would recover			2
" he told me that i would return , but i still did not believe i would return back to running			0
it was really hard for me , " she said			0
the doctor 's confidence was well placed , but it took until 2012 for @entity11 to rediscover her best form , just in time for the @entity160			1
a blistering command performance in the 10,000 saw her claim her third @entity12 gold , but her double attempt was thwarted in the 5,000 by @entity105 and @entity204 of @entity113 as she was relegated to the bronze medal position			1
@entity11 shows no sign of winding down her career , but she is involved in several commercial projects , which include building a hotel			2
having earned her own wealth , she takes pride in providing employment in a developing country such as @entity8			2
" we create jobs for those who do n't have any			0
we create opportunities , " she said			0
the next goal @entity11 has never forgotten the help of her family and the sacrifices she has had to make to achieve her success			2
" i remember there were days where i felt could not complete my training program			0
but because i had to finish it , because my coach ( @entity226 ) would advise me that it 's a must to complete the program , i would finish the program , " she said			0
" there were times i got so tired that i would go to bed without eating food , only drinking water			0
to run well and be a good sportsperson , you have to work hard			0
" rising around 6 a.m. , she will do two sessions per day , preparing for the track season with intensive speed sessions as part of a specially devised schedule			0
@entity11 is usually in bed by 9 p.m. and restricts herself to a mostly pasta and rice diet			2
she will eventually move up to the 42 kilometers which make up the longest race on the track and field program -- the marathon being her ultimate goal for the @entity249 in @entity250			0
" i want to do something special , that is historic and unforgettable			0
especially in the @entity12 marathon , i want to compete there			0
i believe that is what is left for me to achieve			0
