-- want to try for a cease - fire to end the burgeoning conflict between @entity3 and @entity4 in @entity5 ? mix a cocktail of three ingredients : urgency , the desire of both sides to climb down ; an agreement that allows them to do so ; and a mediator to bring it all together			1
@entity16 's latest cease - fire proposal , clearly coordinated with ( and accepted by @entity3 ) , ca n't get us there -- at least not yet			1
@entity4 , weak and desperate for a victory , is n't ready to stand down			1
and even if it were ready to do so , any agreement that 's merely a cease - fire wo n't provide a real solution to the @entity3 - @entity4 problem			1
indeed , without a more comprehensive solution to the @entity3 - @entity24 problem , a cease - fire , even if accompanied by more economic openings for @entity5 , will at best offer a temporary respite for these two adversaries			1
sooner or later , @entity3 and @entity4 will once again find themselves back in bitter confrontation			1
we 've seen two prequels to this tragic movie			0
in 2008 - 9 , a conflict over @entity4 ' high - trajectory weapons ended in an @entity3 ground incursion and a unilaterally declared @entity3 cease - fire			1
then again in november 2012 , a weeklong conflict ended in an @entity16 - brokered accord that lasted until the latest outbreak			0
there 's no real end state to this confrontation , in large part because of the diametrically opposed objectives of @entity3 and @entity4 , a resistance organization whose very being depends on continued confrontation			1
yet @entity4 is n't @entity48 or the @entity49 in @entity50 and @entity51			1
over the years , despite their enmity , @entity3 and @entity4 have at times actually managed to find a way to accommodate one another			1
in a perverse way , @entity4 and @entity3 serve one another 's needs			1
@entity4 needs an enemy to maintain its legitimacy and popular appeal			1
and @entity3 may even see advantages in a weakened @entity4 that can rule @entity5 and control the behavior of smaller jihadi groups			1
at the same time , for those @entity3 opposed to a two - state solution , @entity4 ' radicalism and rockets represent an ideal argument as to why @entity3 ca n't make concessions to achieve one			1
and that 's why it is n't at all surprising that this round , like previous ones , will sooner or later have to end			0
@entity3 does n't want to launch a ground incursion , let alone reoccupy @entity5 ; and @entity3 strikes are hurting @entity4 -- and @entity77 too -- while @entity4 rockets are unable to inflict serious damage on @entity3			1
but de-escalation is n't a do - it - yourself project			0
it requires mediation , and for the past week nobody has appeared ready to take on the job			0
the @entity86 is viewed as too biased by @entity3			0
the @entity87 rightly did n't want to jump in until both sides seemed more ready to deal			0
and with no ties with @entity4 , @entity89 is n't especially well - placed to mediate			1
@entity91 has influence with @entity4 , but its ties with @entity3 are too rocky			1
the @entity94 really do n't want to get into the middle of this			0
the @entity98 's @entity97 has little influence with either @entity3 or @entity4			2
the @entity100 do have close ties with @entity4 and might play a role , particularly as bankers to pay thousands of @entity4 employees , a key @entity4 demand			2
so enter @entity16 , the party that brokered the last @entity3 - @entity4 cease - fire in november 2012			1
but as @entity4 rejection of the @entity16 offer makes clear , it 's going to be harder this time around			2
in 2012 , you had a @entity113 government in @entity16 , led by @entity114 , that maintained very close relations with @entity4			2
after all , the @entity113 spawned the @entity24 organization			0
this time around , you have a government led by @entity119 , whose agenda is quite different			0
@entity119 is no @entity113 lover , to say the least			0
his rise to power occurred against the backdrop of what he perceived to be an existential threat from the @entity126			0
and he has made good on his promises of countering islamists at home and in @entity5			2
@entity119 's government has been at the forefront of shutting down @entity5 smuggling tunnels and keeps the @entity134 border crossing closed ( except for a brief opening this past week to let through some wounded @entity77 for medical treatment )			2
this environment of extreme distrust between @entity4 and the @entity16 government complicates matters			2
but @entity119 may have other reasons to engage			0
he must be sensitive to the civilian casualties in @entity5 , which can create political trouble on the @entity16 street , empower @entity16 islamists , and force him to blast @entity3 , which he does n't want to do			2
and by prewiring the cease - fire with @entity3 , he keeps the @entity100 and @entity91 who might take @entity4 ' part in all of this at bay -- for now			1
can the @entity16 pull it off ? this brings us to the deal itself			0
@entity4 entered the conflict badly weakened by a terrible economic situation in @entity5			1
it needs some relief and some kind of victory trophy to justify the destruction in @entity5			1
it has at least three demands : release prisoners picked up in the recent @entity3 @entity169 sweep ; open up @entity134 and eliminate other restrictions on moving people and goods ; and pay salaries for thousands of @entity4 employees			2
( @entity100 has offered to provide money for the salaries , using an intermediary , but @entity3 has thus far blocked these efforts			0
) @entity3 , on the other hand , wants to make sure @entity4 does n't gain too much politically			2
squaring this circle wo n't be easy			0
getting rid of @entity4 ' rockets -- like @entity51 president @entity183 's chemical weapons -- through some kind of international mechanism is likely a bridge too far			2
and a broader agreement that really guarantees long - term stability , with a real economic opening in @entity5 and a formal truce between @entity3 and @entity4 , just does n't seem possible now			1
this is the @entity192 , not @entity193			0
and right now , @entity194 will be lucky to work out a more modest deal			0
@entity4 will lose the political battle too if @entity3 accepts @entity16 's offer and it does n't			2
right now , however , its military wing is resisting			0
clearly , there 's more negotiating in the cards			0
an agreement that eventually delivers a return to the status quo -- quiet for quiet -- is hardly ideal , but it is more real in the world which @entity3 and @entity4 inhabit than a more ambitious peace deal between the two			1
how long the clash will last is anyone 's guess , but a deal is preferable to the events of last week			0
the longer the fight goes on , the greater the chances of some truly horrific incident involving massive civilian casualties			0
that would make escalation , not a deal , inevitable			0
and nobody -- least of all the people of @entity5 -- can afford that .			0

@entity224 and @entity225 : three elements are needed for a cease - fire
they say both sides need to have urgency about ending the @entity5 clash
an *acceptable* agreement and a mediator also must be in place , they say
*authors* : @entity4 is looking for some way to claim a victory from the confrontation
