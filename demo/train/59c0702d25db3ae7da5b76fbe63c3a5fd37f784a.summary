-- so , a judge walks out of a bar ... when the @entity3 decided that @entity4 must choose between his career as a municipal judge and his other career in the entertainment industry , he decided it was n't yet the time to have a last laugh			1
@entity4 has practiced both law and comedy for over 15 years , and in january 2008 he became a part - time municipal judge in @entity14			1
while a judge , he continued to pursue his entertainment career as a standup comedian and actor , including appearing on the tv show " @entity20 " under the name @entity22 , according to court documents			1
@entity4 resigned in person from his judiciary position thursday , just a few hours after the high court issued its unanimous decision			2
i 'm proud of being a judge ; i take great pride in it			0
it is a great life accomplishment , a great career accomplishment , " @entity4 told @entity0 thursday			0
" i do n't like being forced to make a decision			0
" though no longer a judge , @entity4 will continue to be an attorney -- which is permitted -- and moonlight as an actor and comedian			1
he says that over the years he made the decision specifically not to work for big law firms so he could designate his hours as he saw fit and not neglect one career over the other			0
" i 'm going to keep doing what i was doing , but now i 'm not a judge , " @entity4 said			2
according to court documents , @entity4 provided information about his standup routines to the @entity49 on @entity50 following his municipal court appointment			1
after the panel determined that his comedy career was a conflict , he appealed to the state 's high court			2
@entity4 argued that his two careers were completely independent of one another and never overlapped , according to statements put forward in court			1
the @entity3 judges pointed , however , to a writeup in the @entity64 newspaper in which they associated @entity65 , the lawyer , and @entity22 , the actor and comedian			2
" @entity68 , the lawyer , may be free to pursue a parallel career as an actor and comedian			0
once he chose also to serve as a municipal court judge , however , he became subject to the @entity73 , " the judges wrote			1
one canon of the @entity73 requires judges " to conduct any extrajudicial activities in a manner to avoid casting reasonable doubt on the judge 's capacity to act impartially as a judge			1
" @entity4 could be seen in various roles on " @entity89 " -- a show that features social experiments to capture public 's reactions to real - life scenarios played out by actors			1
the judges noted that his roles portraying homophobia , racial profiling and other forms of discrimination could be misleading to someone catching a glimpse of the show before changing the channel			0
his routines at comedy clubs often involve politics and religion			0
" in the course of his routines , @entity4 has demeaned certain people based on national origin and religion and has revealed his political leanings , " the judges wrote			0
" the court can not ignore the distinct possibility that a person who has heard a routine founded on humor disparaging certain ethnic groups and religions will not be able to readily accept that the judge before whom he or she appears can maintain the objectivity and impartiality that must govern all municipal court proceedings			1
" @entity4 maintains that his careers that he loves equally , were always separate			2
" when i 'm a lawyer i 'm focused on that , when i 'm on stage , on set , i focus on that , " he told @entity0			0
" i thought i 've done it pretty well			0

@entity4 held down two careers -- one as a comedian , the other as a judge
@entity134 's @entity3 ruled unanimously that he must choose one or the other
@entity4 -- until today a municipal court judge in @entity14 -- chose comedy
@entity3 ruled that parts of his act could cast doubt on his impartiality ; @entity4 *disputed* that
