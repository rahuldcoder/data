the mission would be led by the military and complement a modest @entity31 training program , based on what was authorized by the @entity33 more than a year ago			1
" @entity14 , @entity12 and @entity13 have agreed to host training sites , and we anticipate the program to train and equip the moderate @entity8 opposition will take approximately 400 @entity2 trainers , with the caveat that this number could fluctuate based on course load , course requirements and other variables , " said @entity34			1
