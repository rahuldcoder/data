@entity0 , the first black man popularly elected to the @entity3 , who died saturday at 95 , and @entity4 , the groundbreaking @entity5 sports anchor who died sunday at 49 , transformed their country 's perceptions of racial identity in distinct ways			1
both challenged expectations by just being black			1
the reactions to their deaths signify the passage of time that separates them			0
when news that @entity4 's valiant and public eight - year battle against cancer ended sunday morning in a @entity24 hospital , many people , especially those who had been @entity5 devotees in the 20 years of @entity4 's tenure at the network , shared the kind of intimate bereavement associated with losing a family member or a close friend			1
in contrast , @entity29 , who had been living in @entity30 , @entity31 , when he died and was roughly 40 years removed from his @entity3 tenure , seemed a figure from so distant a past that people needed to be reminded of who he was and why he was important			1
indeed , in what some call the " age of @entity44 , " it 's hard for many to imagine , much less recall , what a huge thing it was for @entity29 to be elected a @entity50 @entity49 senator from @entity51 in 1966			0
the last two @entity53 senators , @entity54 and @entity55 from @entity56 , achieved their seats a century before the way other senators did , through a majority vote of their state legislature , whose rare indulgence of black plurality came about through @entity64			1
( only after the 17th amendment of the @entity66 was enacted in 1912 were senators elected by a popular vote			0
) nowadays , the fact that @entity29 was elected as a @entity50 back then likely raises more eyebrows among those who ca n't remember that back in the early - to - middle 20th century , the @entity50 remained for many @entity53 the " @entity50 " and was considered more trustworthy than a @entity72 still beholden to a @entity74 segregationist bloc of elected officials			1
@entity29 's electoral triumph was part of the @entity53 advancement in the 1960s			1
more than one black household in @entity81 and elsewhere watched tv with swelling emotion the night of november 8 , 1966 , when @entity29 accepted his victory as " the answer the world has been waiting for , " proving that " the people of @entity51 judge you on your merit and your worth alone			2
" it was a great moment , mitigated by changes that were , by that time , beginning to overtake the @entity50 and the civil rights movement			0
the @entity50 was gradually pulling away from its " moderate - liberal " wing to which @entity29 had invested his political identity , asserting harder conservative values			0
@entity29 , who placed himself in opposition to radicals on both sides of the political spectrum , seemed to more radical black politicians at best a throwback and at worst , an " @entity109 " appeasing the white political establishment			2
even so , @entity29 , who was briefly considered a potential running mate for the 1968 @entity50 nominee @entity111 , became one of @entity111 's unwavering antagonists when the latter proposed two @entity116 nominees whose civil rights credentials he believed to be dubious			0
his was also a staunch , often lonely voice among fellow @entity50 , supporting abortion rights and school desegregation			0
he was denied a third term			0
in later years , he was critical of his party 's rightward trend and was gratified to have lived long enough to have seen his country elect its first black president -- who was , in turn , grateful enough to @entity29 's pioneer steps to give him a presidential gold medal in 2009			2
@entity4 's breakthroughs were quite different from @entity29 's			1
there were no racial barriers to break down at @entity5 when he began working there in 1993			0
but television anchors , whether in network or cable , news or sports , were expected in those days to maintain a smooth , stolid deportment with some elbowroom for empty " happy talk " between story blocks			0
it did n't matter if the anchors were black or white ; indeed , @entity148 was for decades the model for balancing serious news with glitzy gossip			2
@entity5 , by the early 1990s , had stretched the parameters of anchor comportment with such idiosyncratic hipsters as the bombastic @entity155 and the droll @entity156			0
@entity4 gradually made himself stand out among these strong personalities by bringing an up - to - the - minute hip - hop inspired patter as capable of sampling and mixing fragments and phrases as any rap dj. those phrases became riffs that recurred with every highlight tape and the riffs themselves became catch phrases that circulated through the cultural matrix			1
sing along with us now : " cool as the other side of the pillow ! " " and the @entity175 says you got to riiiiiise up ! " " just call @entity177 he 's on a roll ! " and , of course , the ever - present " @entity181 ! " that was always looming over the next home run , slam - dunk or touchdown pass like the rim shot off a drum set			0
it was a style straight out of black musical - theatrical tradition that @entity4 brandished on the airwaves with such slick , causally adorned elegance that even viewers who were total strangers to anything with the hip - hop label got cozy with both the style and the man over two decades			1
throughout , @entity4 made it clear to viewers that while his style was rooted in black culture , he was cosmopolitan and broad - minded in his interests			1
the proud @entity201 could speak with informed passion about the life and death of @entity205 one day and come back the next breaking down the elements of a @entity208 ' " triangle " possession with the concision of a world - class linguist			0
while some @entity53 scoffed at the way he relied on slang and pop argot for his effects , even they never questioned his authenticity , either as a professional broadcaster or as a streetwise observer			1
he helped bring a new archetype to intelligent black style , making doubters and haters alike re-evaluate their misgivings about turn - of - the - century " @entity225 " while inspiring younger minorities to reimagine possibilities in journalism , on - and off - screen			2
@entity29 changed the country as a black man breaking barriers			2
@entity4 changed culture as a black man being -- unapologetically -- himself			1
we 're all better off because of them .			0

@entity0 and @entity4 , two important @entity53 , died
both challenged expectations of what it means to be black and paved way for others
