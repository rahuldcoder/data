passengers lean back as a @entity5 tram -- affectionately called " @entity1 " by locals -- signals its slow approach to the station			1
one by one , riders board through the doors at the back and struggle to pass through the narrow turnstiles			1
jammed bags are a common sight			0
the tram slowly rolls back into action , cruising through the middle of traffic in some of @entity5 's busiest neighborhoods , just as it has for 110 years			1
" the tram is such an icon of @entity5 because it 's closely associated with the big events that have happened here over the last century , " says @entity21 , director and general manager of @entity23			1
" the tram has continued its service and accompanied the city through times good or bad			2
thus it 's very intimately connected to its people			2
" often lacking an on board passenger information system or uniformed station staff , @entity5 's trams can be intimidating for rail virgins			1
but they 're worth figuring out			0
namely because they 're a fantastic way to get to know the city			0
" trams run along some of the best parts of @entity5 , " says @entity21			1
" it 's in the @entity47 with a vantage point [ if you sit on the upper deck of the tram ]			1
they travel at a relatively low speed , so you have time to take the views in			0
" inside the tram , you enjoy a special atmosphere , even poetic			1
" a lot of cities in the world had replaced their tram networks with cars and buses by the 1950s before realizing the importance of the tram in the 1970s			2
they then rebuilt the tram networks , but it 's different			1
so @entity5 is very , very lucky to have the ( older ) tram in this sense			1
" how to ride the tram @entity5 's tram stations usually sit in an " island " in the middle of the street , though a few are on the side of the road			1
stops are marked by stand - alone green signs			0
the tram line runs 30 kilometers on @entity84 , stretching from @entity85 on the western end of the line to @entity88 on the eastern end			2
it runs in only two directions -- eastbound and westbound -- but some routes go further than others			0
it 's really quite simple			2
first , decide which direction you 're heading			2
then , look for the tram that goes to or beyond your station			2
there is a map at the stops			0
for example , if you 're in @entity102 and want to go to @entity103 , all eastbound trams -- those going to @entity106 , @entity88 and @entity103 -- stop at @entity98 , with the exception of the one going to @entity109			1
@entity111 ; sexy , sophisticated , skintight -- @entity114 's iconic cheongsam boarding is through the rear door -- passengers do n't pay until they exit through the front			2
the fare is hk $ 2.30 ( about 30 @entity120 cents per ride ) , regardless of the length of the journey			2
fares can be paid with cash or by swiping one of @entity5 's all - purpose octopus cards inside the tram			1
for comparison 's sake , it costs more than 50 @entity120 cents for a one - stop ride on the more commonly used mtr			1
qr codes are posted at most stations , allowing passengers to find out the time of the next three arriving trams			2
the longest possible tram ride takes around 90 minutes			1
here are a few tram highlights			2
@entity140 street , @entity106 " my favorite section is the loop at the terminal in @entity106 , " says @entity21			1
this route , which actually terminates at @entity106 , is the only section of a tram route that runs through the middle of a wet market			1
" the wet market on @entity155 used to be less organized and vendors would have their stalls set up in the middle of the tramway , " says @entity149 , founder of tram fan club @entity150 and the mini-tram cultural museum , @entity153			1
" when i was young , the tram came and honked ' ding , ding ' and the vendors moved to the sides with their stuff before resuming their original position as the tram left , " says @entity160			2
nowadays , vendors do n't set up in the middle of the tracks			0
stalls can be found on both sides of the street though , meaning shoppers can often be seen zipping from one side the other , dodging trams in the process			2
@entity178 , @entity179 on the western side of @entity84 , @entity178 is packed with dried seafood shops , giving it the nickname " @entity183			0
" " if you go to the @entity183 in the late morning or early afternoon , you can see something very interesting -- shop owners laying large sieves of dried scallops and salted fishes on the side of the road for sun drying , " says @entity160			0
" some even manage to steal a spot on the roof of the tram station			2
" in addition to @entity178 and @entity155 in the east , @entity21 says it 's worth taking time to ride the whole route			1
" there 's the historical area in @entity179 , the business center in @entity102 , the commercial center in @entity103 and the less eye - catching parts of the east of @entity84 , " he says			0
" it gives you a good idea of all different sides of @entity5			1
" the gallery above has more tram route suggestions			0
tram 120 , the oldest running tram @entity21 says @entity23 is looking at dedicating a special car for tourists			1
in the meantime , there are now 163 trams in operation , each with a different number on the front			0
choosing which one to ride requires special knowledge -- not because of where it goes , but because of its history			1
" my favorite is model 120 , the only tram built in the 1950s that survives till now , " says @entity160			1
most of its features are well preserved , including its woven bamboo benches on the upper deck			0
" there is only one worker left in the company who knows how to weave these benches , " says @entity21			0
" there are also two ' party trams ' for hire privately , models 28 and 128			0
car 128 is our second oldest tram			0
" @entity249 are cars built in 2000 -- models 169 and 170			0
" the former management company launched three at that time , hoping it would be the future of @entity5 trams , " says @entity160			1
" but ( the cars ) were heavily criticized by the public as they look too new , too much like a bus			0
so they scraped the idea			0
" future of the tram there are about 30 tram cars built after 2010 now in operation , known as seventh generation trams			1
" most of the public hopes that the tram remains how it is , whereas frequent travelers want it to be more comfortable and modern , " says @entity21			0
" to answer this contradiction , the exterior of the tram shares the same shape as the old tram but it 's almost 100 percent new inside			1
apart from the wheels or controllers that we reuse sometimes			0
these are over 80 years old			0
" tram cars are now made of aluminum instead of wood , so they 're more durable			0
new trams have passenger information systems , more handles and new engines			0
" without government subsidies , we have to stay competitive and offer 21st - century service to our passengers , " says @entity21			0
" it 's not commonly known , but we are now 100 percent made in @entity5 with 150 workers in production and maintenance			1
we are hoping to use our skills to help other cities rebuild their tram networks			0
" a four - day tram pass can be purchased on @entity23 ' website for hk $ 37 ( $ 4.80 ) ; private hire from hk $ 880 per hour ( $ 113 )			1
