-- @entity2 developers , start your engines			1
@entity6 users , start dreaming of how much cooler your desktop or laptop experience could be this summer			1
that 's when @entity2 will launch the latest big cat - themed @entity11 , version 10.8 : @entity13			1
at 8:30 a.m. est thursday , the developer preview version of @entity13 became available to @entity2 's legions of app makers			1
@entity0 was briefed on the new @entity11 prior to the announcement			0
bottom line ? it 's a few more vital steps closer to fully connecting the experience you have on the @entity6 with the world of the @entity24 and the @entity25 -- dumping @entity26 in favor of @entity28 and @entity29 , to take the most radical example			1
it 's almost as if it makes your @entity6 moonlight as an @entity24			2
but it is categorically not the one os to rule them all , if such a thing is even on @entity2 's radar			2
@entity34 10.7 , or @entity38 , launched in july 2011 ; 30 percent of @entity6 users now have it installed			1
( another 50 percent of us still favor @entity40 )			1
coming in the wake of the @entity24 , it was clearly influenced by the success of the device			0
it introduced such @entity47 - like features as multitouch gestures on the trackpad and a " launchpad " of apps that looked just like the @entity24 's home screen			2
some of us began to wonder , with some cause , whether @entity11 and the @entity47 were heading for a marriage down the road			2
the @entity47 moves @entity57 well , here 's the next phase in the relationship , and @entity47 has practically moved in to @entity6 's house			1
if @entity38 was a toothbrush in the bathroom , @entity13 is a chest of drawers in the bedroom			2
reminders , @entity28 , @entity67 , notifications , @entity69 and @entity29 integration â € ” all @entity47 's most intimate stuff is here , and it all pretty much looks the same as it does on the @entity24			2
most of it is designed to sync up so it is exactly the same			0
see also : @entity77 and @entity78 and @entity11 has had to throw out some of its stuff			0
bouncing icons in the dock ? who needs them when you 've got notifications , which appear in classy banners down the side of the screen ? the venerable antique @entity90 software , @entity26 , a 2002 vintage ? a stupid wagon - wheel coffee table , says @entity47			2
instead , here 's @entity28 , which will still let you im your contacts ( if you must )			0
but what it really wants you to do is use @entity2 's seamless texting replacement of the same name			0
admittedly , the thought of being able to immediately text anyone with an iphone for free from your desktop is so unbelievably cool , it can bring on an attack of the vapors			0
you get the sense the @entity6 is going to be happy with its new roommate			0
what 's not to like about @entity111 , which can seamlessly mirror your desktop on an hdtv ? or a separate @entity114 app , where you can attach notes to the desktop like stickies ? or @entity67 , which will mean a lot more cross-device play ? or a " share sheet , " which effectively means developers are going to be able to put @entity29 buttons everywhere ? @entity13 will already let you tweet from all standard @entity11 apps such as @entity126 and @entity127			1
that means you can sit and take photos of yourself and instantly tweet them , to your heart 's content			0
it 's a boon for @entity29 users ( @entity29 readers , not so much )			0
so things are going to be a lot more fun around the edges of the @entity11 -- which is no bad thing			0
at the grand old age of 12 , @entity11 was starting to seem a little too same - y with each iteration			0
this new younger partner is about to give the @entity6 a new lease on life			0
( how much that will cost , we do n't know ; @entity2 is n't announcing a price yet , or a launch date more precise than " late summer			1
" ) but do n't expect @entity47 to go hog - wild and bring its apps on board in future versions			1
@entity2 is giving a hefty push to the @entity6 app store , which benefits from a security feature called @entity155 where you can limit installations to just @entity6 store apps			1
( you might want to do this for your malware prone - parents , say			0
) developers are going to have to make two separate versions of apps they want on @entity6 and @entity47 for some time to come , and that 's just fine with @entity2			1
when it comes to its two operating systems , the company seems to believe living together is good enough			0
so what do you think ? will you buy it ? take a quick gander at a video we put together with material from @entity2 , then a gallery of screenshots -- and last but not least , your chance to chat up a storm about this major @entity6 development in the comments			1

@entity2 : latest @entity6 operating system , named @entity13 , will launch this summer
30 percent of @entity6 users have os 10.7 installed , another 50 percent favor @entity40
developers will *continue* to make two separate versions of apps they want on @entity6 and @entity47
