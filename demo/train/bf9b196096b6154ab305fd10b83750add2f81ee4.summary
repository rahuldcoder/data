-- to hear some @entity3 tell it , three coordinated attacks that killed four prison officials in five hours monday hardly raised anyone 's pulse			1
police arrests two suspects in one of the three attacks			1
they 're used to this level of violence , said @entity14 , director of the @entity15 in @entity16			1
although what happened is normal in @entity16 , @entity17 said , that 's not to say that citizens are not concerned			1
" we 're as scared as ever , " he said tuesday			2
@entity22 , a @entity23 analyst with the @entity25 consulting firm , also has come to expect the violence			2
" what else is new ? " she said when asked about the killings			2
@entity29 , an expert on @entity31 gangs , said all of @entity23 is under attack from organized crime cartels because the region is pinched between @entity36 and @entity37 , the two biggest sources of drugs in the area			1
@entity42 interdiction efforts that have targeted the flow of drugs through the @entity44 also have forced cartels to travel through the @entity15 isthmus , @entity29 said			1
within @entity23 , he said , @entity16 , @entity47 and @entity48 have the worst problems			1
among those three nations , @entity16 stands out			1
" when you talk about a country being hollowed out by organized crime , @entity16 is at the top of the list , " @entity29 said			1
there are two main reasons , he said : geography and an incompetent and corrupt government			1
" @entity16 bunches right up against @entity37 , " @entity29 said			1
" any spillover effect is almost certainly going south			2
" said @entity22 , " the narcos are coming down from @entity37			1
" in addition , @entity29 said , the federal government is not able to control large segments of the country			1
for example , @entity67 state in northern @entity16 , bordered on two sides by @entity37 , is lawless , he said			1
@entity22 made the same point			2
" the narcos control about 40 percent of the territory down there , which is pretty amazing , " she said			0
@entity22 also pointed out that the government has reduced anti-crime spending in the 2010 budget because of the nation 's dire economic situation			1
" if you do n't have resources , you ca n't pay for troops and supplies and intelligence , " she said			0
@entity29 , who just wrote a book on the @entity85 gang of @entity23 , said there are two main criminal elements in @entity16 : drug cartels that deal in large - scale exportation and street gangs that sell drugs at the retail level and are involved in other crimes , such as robbery and extortion			1
in some cases , they work together			0
when those criminals get arrested , they continue their activities on the inside			0
" the prisons , in general , are centers of corruption , " @entity17 said			0
" from inside prison , they direct kidnappings , extortion , drug trafficking			0
" monday 's attacks on the prison officials resulted from efforts to weed out corruption in the nation 's prisons , @entity17 said			2
officials have been clamping down on what goods inmates can receive and the use of cell phones within prison walls			0
they also are transferring some top - level criminals to high - security prisons			0
" what happened is a reaction from gangs who want control of the prisons , " @entity17 said			0
" they 're trying to show strength through force			0
" interior minister @entity134 was quoted in several newspapers tuesday as saying the attacks were in retaliation for the recent transfer of several gang leaders to high - security prisons			2
two arrests have been made in monday 's shootings and the investigation continues , said @entity144 , spokesman for the @entity3 prison system			1
" this was a very structured job ; very well - defined , " @entity144 said from @entity16 , the nation 's capital			1
killed were a prison assistant director , a warden and two guards			2
one guard and a shooting suspect were wounded , as were three citizens			0
one of the wounded was a woman in the eighth month of pregnancy , news accounts said			0
according to published reports in the @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity16 and @entity163 21 newspapers , this is what happened : the first attack occurred around 7 a.m. monday in @entity16 when two gunmen on a motorcycle fired an @entity170 assault rifle at three guards who were transporting a prisoner			1
one of the guards was killed and another wounded			2
a national civil police unit driving in front of the prison detail gave chase and captured the suspects , one of whom suffered a serious leg injury			0
the second attack happened 10 minutes later , when the warden at the prison in the city of @entity186 , in central @entity16 , was gunned down while he ate in front of the hospital general @entity188			1
the warden , @entity190 , was at the hospital to pick up the body of a prisoner who had died after surgery			0
two men and a pregnant 19 - year - old woman were wounded in the attack			0
witnesses told police four men in a green vehicle fired and fled			0
authorities found an abandoned @entity203 nearby that matched the description			0
inside , they found a 9 mm pistol and ammunition for other weapons			0
the third attack occurred around noon on the @entity210 near the city of @entity212 , where @entity213 , 40 , was the prison 's assistant director			0
he and his 31 - year - old driver were killed as they returned to the prison after a trip to @entity16			1
authorities said they found @entity170 shells at the scene			0
@entity212 gov. @entity223 said a prison director and two assistant directors already have been killed in the state , @entity161 reported			2
analyst @entity22 sees little hope			0
" it 's a lose - lose situation , no matter how you look at it , " she said .			0

four killed in three orchestrated attacks , local papers say
analysts blame attacks on flow of drugs through country
@entity16 on route from @entity37 to @entity36 , two biggest sources of drugs in area
analysts also blame @entity3 government they say is incompetent and corrupt
