-- @entity2 police on friday closed their investigation into @entity6 publicist @entity5 's shooting death late last year , concluding that an ex-convict murdered her in a random , botched robbery			1
the suspect , 43 - year - old @entity10 , pulled a handgun and shot himself last december as @entity13 detectives approached him at @entity6 's @entity14			1
but despite evidence even then tying @entity10 to @entity5 's murder last november , authorities kept the case open			2
@entity13 police lt. @entity19 told @entity0 early this year that " we hope to close it soon			1
" that decision came six months later			0
the city 's police department issued a press release friday stating that it had " completed the exhaustive investigation " by determining that @entity10 was " the sole perpetrator of this most heinous crime			0
" " all facts and evidence conclusively indicate that mr. @entity10 acted alone and was in possession of the murder weapon when confronted in @entity6 for questioning " the night he committed suicide , the @entity13 police department said			1
@entity5 , 64 , was driving last fall through a posh @entity13 neighborhood on her way home from a @entity6 movie premiere party when she was shot several times , police said			1
speculation thrived after the shooting , including a theory that a professional hit man had targeted @entity5			0
that was until , at least , investigators began to hone in on @entity10			0
" with mr. @entity10 's background , we believe most likely it was a robbery gone bad , " @entity13 detective sgt. @entity50 said in december 2010			2
" we believe it was a random act			0
" yet authorities continued to look into the case , with police chief @entity57 saying then that the investigation was just " 60 % to 70 % complete			0
" still , through friday , police never indicated that anyone other than @entity10 was ever a suspect			0
detectives scanned 150,000 e-mails and texts belonging to @entity5 , investigated thousands of tips and reviewed thousands of financial documents tied to the victim , @entity13 police said friday			1
they also revisited @entity5 's route on the night of her murder , recovered video footage and conducted numerous interviews with relatives , friends , contacts and others			0
ultimately , the most telling piece of evidence was that the gun that fired several rounds into @entity5 's chest was the same weapon @entity10 used to kill himself when police approached to question him about her death			2
" @entity13 police personnel assigned to this case worked in excess of 10,000 hours to thoroughly investigate each and every tip , theory and legitimate lead in order to bring this investigation to conclusion , " the police statement said .			1

@entity13 police say @entity10 killed @entity5 last fall
they reach this conclusion after police spent 10,000 hours on the probe
@entity10 , an ex-convict , was the only person ever *identified* as a suspect
police say he killed @entity5 in a botched robbery , then later killed himself
