-- weeks after @entity4 's startling admission that he used performance - enhancing drugs throughout his cycling career , the world of sport has been rocked by explosive new allegations about cheating in sports - mad @entity8			1
on thursday , the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) published the findings of a year - long investigation that claimed the use of banned substances such as growth stimulants was " widespread " among professional athletes across a range of sports there			1
in many instances , the report said , the substances are not yet approved for human use			1
in its conclusion , the @entity10 said there are clear parallels between what has been discovered in @entity8 and the @entity29 investigation into @entity4 -- who was recently stripped of his seven @entity32 titles -- underlining the transnational threat posed by doping to professional sport			1
the report stressed that it is not just athletes that are involved , but their support staff , doctors and organized criminal elements			2
what is doping ? it involves an athlete taking drugs or blood products to artificially boost their performance during training and competition			1
what substances are we talking about here ? the @entity10 report identified an evolving market in a new generation of @entity56 ( @entity57 ) -- known as peptides and hormones			1
according to the @entity10 , some of these substances are perceived by athletes to be undetectable , making them attractive to those seeking to gain an unfair advantage			1
-- growth hormone releasing peptides " peptides " stimulate the release of an increased level of human growth hormone ( @entity70 ) , making them popular among athletes and body builders to promote muscle growth			1
they are also used in combination with anabolic steroids -- which also promote size and strength -- to maintain muscle gain			2
they are sold as a cream or in a solution for injection			2
while some peptide supplements are perfectly legal as a recovery aid after exercise , growth - stimulating peptides are classified as a prohibited substance on the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) prohibited list and therefore are banned for use by professional athletes in and out of competition			2
-- growth hormone @entity96 the report also identified the use of @entity100 , a variant of growth hormone with fat - burning properties often taken by athletes to increase their power			2
clinical trials suggest it may even help to repair and enhance muscle formation , according to the @entity10 report and @entity91			1
@entity110 - 9604 is not prohibited by @entity91			2
-- @entity111 ( @entity111 ) like anabolic steroids , @entity111 build strength , bone density and muscle mass by stimulating the body 's androgen receptor , which itself boosts the uptake of testosterone -- the main male hormone -- into cells			0
sarms have a lower risk of side effects normally associated with the prolonged use of anabolic steroids , such as high blood pressure , liver damage , depression , baldness , the development of male characteristics in females and the development of breast tissue in males			0
according to @entity10 report , @entity111 are often used in combination with other @entity139 , including @entity70			1
sarms are a prohibited substance for elite athletes both in and out of competition under @entity91 rules			0
-- @entity146 growth factors ( @entity147 - 1 ) @entity147 is one of the primary hormones necessary for cell growth in the body			0
many athletes use @entity147 for its anabolic effect in muscle and to facilitate the development of cartilage and bone			0
in many cases , athletes will use @entity70 and @entity147 in small doses to reduce the chances of returning a positive anti-doping sample , the @entity10 report says			1
@entity147 is also banned by @entity91			0
-- mechano growth factor ( mgf ) a variant of @entity147 , @entity164 leads to an increase in the muscle cells necessary for adult muscles to continue growth beyond their genetic limit			0
it is often used by bodybuilders due to its role in muscle repair following exercise			0
banned under @entity91 rules , @entity164 is also illegal to possess in many countries without a prescription			0
-- other substances the @entity10 report also identified a number of other performance - enhancing substances -- some being prescription only medicines : @entity186 and @entity187 -- both peptides with anabolic effects , which are both prohibited by @entity91			1
@entity190 -- promotes muscle growth			0
banned by @entity91 , with its possession without legal authority is illegal			0
@entity194 -- used to speed up recovery from injury , it is an unregulated substance banned by @entity91 .			0
