-- @entity1 have become used to the fact that most of the jobs created by @entity4 are in @entity5			1
we know that @entity7 told president @entity8 that " those jobs are n't coming back			0
" recently , an executive at @entity4 said that the company has no obligation to solve @entity14 's problems by moving some of those jobs back to the @entity1			1
as a business , @entity4 has a right to fear that moving the assembly work from @entity5 to the @entity1 will entail raising labor costs so high as to make the company less competitive and profitable			1
but for it to say that it has no obligation to help solve @entity14 's problems is completely unacceptable			1
virtually every piece of technology in any @entity4 product had its origin or was partially developed on the basis of a @entity1 government - funded program			1
in a global world where piracy of products is commonplace , @entity4 , like other multinationals , has continuously pressed the @entity1 government to enforce copyright and patent laws to protect its intellectual property from international theft			1
does @entity4 owe anything to @entity40 ? you betchum			1
skeptics are right to point out that moving the factory assembly operations to the @entity1 is a nonstarter as long as we continue to have free trade with @entity5			1
these kinds of jobs are labor - intensive , and the differential in the cost of labor between @entity14 and @entity5 is just too large			2
but this is not where the real value or the good jobs we want for @entity1 lies			2
the assembly value in an @entity58 is only about $ 7			0
the real treasure - trove is in the parts			0
for example , the displays , the processors , memory chips and other key electronic components comprise nearly half of the value of the @entity58			0
these components require intensive capital and technology investments , but they do not require a great amount of labor			0
in other words , they can all be produced in @entity14			2
indeed , according to a recent study by @entity78 , to supply the @entity1 market , the most competitive location in which to produce these components is the @entity1			2
at the moment , however , @entity4 is not procuring most of these parts in @entity14			1
with a few exceptions , the company is getting them from @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity5 or @entity89			0
let 's take @entity91 , a product made by @entity93 of @entity94 , @entity95 , that is used as the display for the @entity58 and @entity97 as well as many other smartphones and tablets			0
@entity94 can and does make that glass in @entity14			0
but to gain access to @entity5 's market , @entity94 is pressured by the @entity5 government to make @entity91 in @entity5 so that it can be used in any @entity5 factory that makes a product that needs the glass			0
basically , @entity94 must invest and produce in @entity5 , even though , in my estimates , it might be less expensive to make @entity91 in @entity14 and export it to @entity5			0
the same is true for other assembly line parts			0
so what should @entity4 do ? we know that @entity112 , a @entity86 supplier , had started to produce a key processor for @entity4 in @entity114 , @entity115			0
that 's a good first step			0
@entity4 should go further by telling other suppliers that it wants more components to be made in @entity14			1
one advantage for this move is that it can create an environment in which more research and development is possible , which in turn can strengthen overall innovation for @entity4			2
@entity4 should also move some of its assembly operations to @entity127			1
@entity127 labor is n't as cheap as @entity5 labor , but after one adjusts for the differences in the cost of shipping , establishing assembly - line factories in @entity127 should be quite acceptable from a financial and quality perspective			2
by moving more production of advanced components to @entity14 and the human labor to @entity127 , more jobs will be added to @entity14 and help reduce the @entity1 - @entity127 trade deficit , which is about $ 55 billion annually			1
and by having the assembly work just over the border , @entity4 can ensure that costs can be kept under control			2
as @entity4 is trying to get out of the recent controversy surrounding its suppliers ' labor practices in @entity5 , where workers put in more than 60 hours a week , the world 's most highly valued company would do well to consider how best to spend and invest its $ 100 billion cash pile			1
it needs to realize that what is good for @entity4 can also be good for the @entity1 economy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			0

@entity4 says the company has no obligation to help solve @entity14 's problems
does @entity4 owe anything to @entity40 ? @entity157 says yes
@entity166 : @entity4 should tell suppliers it wants more components made in the @entity1
@entity4 can also move some of its assembly operations to @entity127 , @entity157 says
