@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity1 assistant football coach @entity3 stood in front of the @entity5 in march to speak against a proposal to protect sexual identity , he was merely exercising his right as a private citizen , he would later say			1
it came as no surprise that @entity3 , an outspoken born - again @entity12 and a preacher , believes that homosexuality is a sin			0
but his passionate opposition to the proposed amendment to the city 's anti-discrimination policy raised questions as to whether @entity3 was really speaking as a citizen			1
after all , the university 's own anti-discrimination policy does just what @entity3 spoke against : it protects students and staff from discrimination based on their sexual orientation			1
adding to the confusion , when addressing the council , @entity3 gave his address as " one @entity33 , @entity0 , @entity1 , " home turf of the @entity35			1
" the question that i have for you all is , like @entity38 , what are you going to do with @entity40 ? " @entity3 asked the council			0
" you will be held to great accountability for the decision that you make			0
and so , like @entity38 , who did n't -- who kind of waffled around -- he was n't sure			0
he knew what to do , i think			0
but he let political correctedness ( sic ) shape his thinking			0
" the measure passed anyway , by a 4 - 3 vote			0
@entity3 's comments triggered national media attention and calls for his dismissal			2
this week , all eyes were on @entity0 , @entity1 , where the @entity5 held a public hearing on a similar change to its anti-discrimination policy			1
many expected @entity3 to show up at monday 's hearing , particularly because this time the vote would be in his own backyard			2
but that did n't happen			0
instead , @entity3 penned a letter published in the @entity68 newspaper a day before the hearing			0
it stated his support of @entity1 's anti-discrimination policy , despite his personal beliefs			1
" i have and will embrace every player i coach , gay or straight ... but i wo n't embrace a legal policy that supports a lifestyle that @entity79 calls sin , " he wrote			1
@entity3 told the newspaper he stayed away from monday 's hearing to avoid media attention being diverted from the issues and toward him			2
@entity2 's repeated attempts to reach @entity3 for comment went unanswered , and an athletic department spokesman said he would not be commenting further			2
it 's unclear how much pressure the @entity1 has put on @entity3 to keep quiet after the uproar over his public comments in march			1
in an interview with @entity2 , @entity1 chancellor @entity91 acknowledged that @entity3 's views are in stark contrast to the university 's anti-discrimination policy			1
he said he has spoken to the coach , telling him to be clear when he speaks publicly that he 's not doing so on behalf of the school			1
@entity91 said he " absolutely " understands why a gay football player would feel uncomfortable playing on the team now			0
@entity3 's comments , according to @entity91 , brought a " certain level of embarrassment " to the school , and more than 2,500 people have signed an online petition calling for him to be fired			1
but the chancellor said that just because @entity3 has an opinion that differs from the university 's is not grounds for dismissal			1
the coach merely exercised his right to free speech , @entity91 said			2
" if i thought he was discriminating against a football player or anybody else on the basis of sexual orientation , that would violate university policy and would be grounds for some remedy , " @entity91 said			1
" but i have no evidence that he 's done that			2
" one of @entity3 's biggest fans over the years was @entity127 , who was born and raised in @entity128 and , like most @entity129 , bleeds @entity35 red			1
@entity127 , an active member of the @entity12 faith who is also gay , credits @entity3 with helping strengthen his relationship with @entity40			0
" i was in middle school ( and ) my dad invited him to come speak at our church , " said @entity127 , now a first year master 's student at @entity135			2
" he 's a very engaging , dynamic speaker			2
it 's hard not to like him when you hear him speak			2
" but his reverence for @entity3 changed when he heard what the longtime @entity35 coach said to the @entity5			1
" it does n't bother me that he thinks homosexuality is a sin and all that ... i hear people say that all the time , " @entity127 said			0
he heard @entity3 express his position against homosexuality in 1999 on a christian radio program , triggering outrage from the @entity155 , which threatened a lawsuit			0
@entity3 's comments in @entity128 went beyond his opposition to homosexuality , according to @entity160			1
" i do n't agree that along with that he should be preventing any group of people from getting jobs that they deserve and to allow them to be fired from jobs , " @entity127 said			0
" that 's not what the @entity169 teaches			2
" @entity127 said the worst part is that @entity3 's comments make it even more difficult for @entity174 athletes to feel comfortable living their lives openly			0
" there 's a whole community of @entity174 athletes out there that are playing for the teams that we know and love across the country , " @entity127 said			0
" it 's about those athletes and creating an environment in @entity186 athletics that they feel comfortable in			0
" @entity127 and his parents , who are both @entity1 graduates , wrote a letter to the university saying they believe " more should have been said " by university officials to make it abundantly clear that discrimination against @entity174 individuals has no place at @entity1			1
although @entity127 wrote that the @entity1 needs to " take a stand against @entity3 , " neither he nor his parents called for @entity3 's firing			1
in fact , @entity127 believes the university has a unique opportunity to turn the negative situation into a positive one by " publicly show ( ing ) some support , acceptance and advocacy for one of the most marginalized groups in our culture			0
" " i want gay and lesbian athletes to know that we love it when they score a touchdown ... and i want them to know that we hate it when they fumble -- just like everyone else , " @entity127 said .			0
