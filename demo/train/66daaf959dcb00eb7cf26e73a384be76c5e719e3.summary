@entity0 -- want to be an @entity3 superpower ? then an aircraft carrier , it seems , is the minimum requirement for joining this elite club			1
in @entity12 , a retro - fitted former @entity9 carrier dating back to the @entity11 era is the flagship of the country 's hopes for a " blue water " navy -- a fleet that can operate on the high seas thousands of nautical miles from base			1
@entity22 has launched its first home built aircraft carrier as part of a plan to operate three carrier battle groups by 2020			1
and @entity28 -- whose navy is officially classed as a self - defense force -- has controversially unveiled what it has classed as a flat - topped helicopter destroyer , but to @entity12 looks perilously akin to an aircraft carrier			1
this latest piece of must - have military hardware might be expensive to build , logistically complex to operate and costly to defend -- and in the context of drone and submarine technology , some argue , increasingly obsolete - but the aircraft carrier is still regarded as one of the strongest projections of a nation 's military power			1
more image than action ? the carrier race comes amid rising assertiveness of @entity3 's military powers and changing conditions in the region			1
for @entity28 , it 's a counter to the rising power of @entity12 and the threat from @entity55			1
for @entity22 , its carrier flexes its muscle in the direction of @entity59 while @entity12 wants to project power along its trade routes and regional interests			2
just 20 aircraft carriers are active throughout the world and the @entity65 operates 10 of them			2
for many military analysts , however , the value of a carrier lies in having one rather than ever using one			1
@entity70 , @entity71 in @entity72 at @entity73 , says there is a disconnect between what an aircraft carrier projects and what it can actually do			0
" needing an aircraft carrier and wanting one are two different things , " @entity70 told @entity1 , adding that @entity79 -- despite recent headlines -- has had a long history of aircraft carrier operation			0
" @entity22 has operated carriers before ; @entity12 has n't but @entity12 is a new foray into carrier naval warfare / carrier naval operations , " he said			1
" @entity28 interestingly had the world 's first aircraft carrier			2
" costly carrier as an indication of how much a carrier costs , @entity92 is plowing an estimated Â £ 5 billion ( us $ 8 billion ) into its new carrier @entity96			0
it is so large that it is being constructed in sections at six shipyards around the @entity92 before being slotted together at @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102			0
perhaps fittingly for @entity12 's biggest naval gamble , its refurbished @entity9 carrier was once touted to become a casino in @entity106 , a @entity107 ( @entity107 ) of @entity12 and a gambling center			2
" this is really its initial training platform , " said @entity70			0
" it 's unlikely that this carrier would be able to pack the sort of punch that would make it useful as a power projection carrier outside of limited and asymmetric incidents in @entity79			0
" you could conceivably ship it down into the @entity120 for the purposes of intimidating weaker @entity3 nations -- but that carries with it a lot of risks not least the proliferation of anti-carrier anti-sea control platforms in @entity79			0
" vulnerable he said submarines , ship - launched and land - based ballistic missiles all make aircraft carriers vulnerable to attack in the context of modern conventional warfare			2
" the sort of things , interestingly , that @entity12 has been building to keep the @entity138 out of the @entity139 are also being built by @entity3 nations to keep large scale @entity12 naval platforms from being as powerful as they might be in the region			2
" while @entity22 , @entity12 and @entity28 may have deep pockets , the technology and military infrastructure necessary to operate what amounts to a floating military city for thousands of personnel still lags among these @entity3 superpowers			1
military analyst @entity152 , associate professor of political science at the @entity154 , in his book @entity156 , says learning to operate an aircraft carrier is difficult and time - consuming " carrier warfare is one of the only major military innovations requiring high levels of both financial intensity and organizational capital to adopt , " he said			0
" operating a floating airfield and the ship itself , plus coordinating with support ships , is simply a much harder set of tasks than lining up the big guns of a battleship and firing			0
" carrier losses aircraft carriers also have one of the highest attrition rates of any arm of the military			1
according to a study by professor @entity180 of the @entity181 , between 1949 and 1988 the @entity65 and @entity178 lost 12,000 aircraft and 8,500 air crew			0
analysts say that with @entity12 training less than 100 pilots to operate fixed - wing aircraft from carriers , its capacity to absorb losses is low			1
" it 's difficult to train pilots up to land on what is effectively a moving airfield , " @entity70 said			0
" while @entity12 will learn from the successes and failures of every country that has gone before it , it does take a lot of time and @entity12 has less than 100 airmen who are being trained to fly their version of a carrier aircraft			0
" meanwhile , as @entity22 and @entity12 size up each other in the carrier war , analysts say it has to be remembered that both carrier nations have ships that are a third the size of the @entity138 nimitz class ships			1
" for the @entity12 , a lot of it is tied up with a story about itself becoming a great power , " @entity70 said			0
" for @entity12 to be a great power it must be a great maritime power and to be a great power it must have carriers and blue water naval platforms			0

@entity12 , @entity22 and @entity28 have turned to aircraft carriers as an extension of military *prestige*
aircraft carriers are expensive to build , logistically complex to operate and costly to defend
carrier race comes amid rising assertiveness of @entity3 's military powers
military analysts say the value of a carrier lies in having one rather than using one
