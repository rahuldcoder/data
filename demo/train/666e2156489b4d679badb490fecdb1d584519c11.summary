-- small in size , the saints ' relics provide a precious spiritual connection for parishioners at @entity6			1
still , the church 's pastor and police in @entity6 , @entity10 , a river town settled by @entity12 colonists in the mid- 18th century , are mystified as to why someone would steal nine of them			1
they hold little monetary value and would be difficult to sell without their paperwork			0
" we are kind of at a loss , " police sgt. @entity19 told @entity0 saturday			0
the theft occurred sometime between @entity24 and january 4 , when the dollar - coin - sized containers holding the nine relics were found empty			1
those containers are displayed in larger vessels , called reliquaries , that sit on two side altars			0
for many worshipers , saints help them get closer to @entity33 , according to the rev. @entity34			0
@entity34 said the thief or thieves may have thought the relics , along with any small amount of gold or other metal with them , might make the job worthwhile			2
@entity34 said he doubts anyone took the items , which can include portions of a saint 's body or pieces of garment , for religious reasons			2
" if they had taken one ... i can see that , but to take nine of them , it does n't seem practical , " he said			0
" this will probably be something that will turn up somewhere once they realize there 's no real street value , " police chief @entity57 told @entity0 @entity59 affiliate @entity58			0
the church has about two dozen relics , one of which belonged to @entity6 and was placed around the neck of her statue inside the church , said @entity34			1
the relic of the patron saint of @entity74 is now in a secure location			1
the relics have been part of the @entity6 parish since the 1930s and 1940s , when the pastor at that time brought them back from several trips he made to @entity84 and elsewhere in @entity85			1
" some people are really upset ... ( asking ) why somebody would do this , " @entity34 said of the theft			0
searches of area pawnshops have yielded none of the relics , @entity19 said			2
" we are hoping we can get help from the community , by word of mouth or at the church or ( someone who ) saw something			2
" because of its history and decor , the church is popular with tourists visiting the largely @entity107 town , an hour south of @entity59			1
the parish was founded by @entity109 who came from @entity111			0
community leaders tout @entity114 's heritage , charm and historic homes , some of which were built with distinctive vertical log construction			0
@entity121 immigrants who followed the @entity12 founders built rock and brick homes popular with visitors			1
the town of about 4,400 is on the west bank of the @entity128			2
@entity34 said the church , which serves about 1,100 families , will build a database to get a better handle on records and paperwork surrounding the relics			1
leaders also are considering ways to secure the relics by placing them under glass attached to walls			2
for now , he and others are praying for the return of the historic and spiritual items			0
while @entity6 has insurance , the theft of the relics is no ordinary matter			1
" how do we put value on it ? " @entity34 asked .			0
