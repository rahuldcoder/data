eighty years -- that 's about how long it took the state of @entity3 to posthumously pardon the last three of nine men who were falsely accused and wrongly convicted of raping two white women on a train			1
they infamously were called the @entity8 , because the nine black men were just 12 - to 19 - years - old when they were arrested in 1931			2
it turned out that the women , @entity12 and @entity13 , had lied to police about the rapes			0
at one of the trials , @entity16 recanted her testimony , saying she had made it all up			0
still , the all - white jury convicted the boys , one after another			0
forty - three years later , a similar story : this time it was @entity26 , who died recently of cancer			0
@entity26 spent nearly three years in prison in @entity29 after he was convicted in 1974 of a rape and murder that he had nothing to do with , according to the @entity29 @entity33			2
ancient history , you say ? we 've moved past those shameful days of unequal justice , you insist			1
in 2012 , according to the @entity38 , nearly 87,000 " forcible rapes " were reported			0
that 's down 7 % from the number of rapes reported in 2008			1
law enforcement agencies estimate that the number of false rape accusations ranges from 2 % to 8 % annually , or between 2,000 and 7,000 cases each year			1
exact numbers are difficult to track because of the lack of in - depth research on false rape cases and because of the varying definitions of what constitutes an " unfounded " rape claim			1
it can mean the alleged victim did not try to fight off the suspect or suffer injuries , was not threatened with a weapon or the victim and perpetrator had a previous relationship			0
law enforcement experts agree that rapes are widely underreported , and no one is suggesting that violence against women is n't a serious problem			2
but experts do not dispute that false rape accusations can and do happen			1
many of those innocent men end up in prison or with lives shattered			1
one of the unfortunate statistics in 2002 , @entity74 was one of those unfortunate statistics			0
he was just 17 when a classmate , @entity75 , 15 , falsely accused him of raping her at school			1
banks , then a top football talent , spent more than five years in prison and five years on probation for rape and kidnapping			2
he was exonerated after he got his accuser to admit on tape that she lied about the rape			1
banks later explained that his attorney had advised him to take a plea bargain and avoid a jury trial because " ... i was a big black teenager , and no jury would believe anything i said			0
" the @entity91 sued his accuser , and she has been ordered to repay the $ 750,000 she was awarded in a lawsuit against the district			2
it seems more men who insist they have been falsely accused of rape are trying a new tactic : suing their accusers in civil court , mostly for defamation			1
they are seeking to repair their ruined lives , save their careers and clear their names			0
make no mistake , i could never defend men who rape and believe even harsher penalties are needed for rapists			1
but i can understand why some men are opting to fight back			2
and i even agree with this strategy in some cases			0
@entity114 founder @entity113 is fighting back			0
@entity113 is suing his ex-girlfriend , @entity115 , after she accused him in 2012 on @entity116 and @entity118 posts of physically abusing her and raping one of her friends ( who later denied this )			1
recently , it sounded as if @entity127 winner and @entity129 quarterback @entity126 , who was accused of raping a fellow student , and his legal team were also considering this strategy			1
his attorney , @entity133 , said that they have not ruled out a civil suit of their own			2
" his reputation is important to him , " @entity133 said after his client was cleared when the state attorney said no charges would be filed			0
" his career is important to him			0
" the accuser 's attorney has requested a review of the case by the @entity29 attorney general 's office and argues that the @entity148 tried to stymie the rape investigation of the star athlete			1
throughout the investigation , @entity126 insisted that the sex was consensual			2
and his unidentified accuser equally insisted she was raped but was heavily intoxicated and had a " broken memory " of events			2
however , toxicology reports found no drugs in her system and very low alcohol levels			0
complicating the case further , @entity126 's dna was found on the woman 's underwear and a second dna sample , reportedly from her boyfriend , was found on her shorts			1
no simple solution to clearing your name admittedly , my initial reaction to hearing no charges would be filed was relief			0
for me , the case was troubling on both sides			0
and though i 'm no lawyer , i thought : " @entity126 should sue his accuser			1
if he 's really innocent , he should prove it and clear his name			1
" but it may not be that simple			0
@entity180 , a defense attorney and former assistant district attorney in @entity182 , warns that while initiating these lawsuits against accusers may seem like a good way for men who are wrongly accused to get justice , he 'd be hard - pressed to advise any of his clients to pursue this strategy			1
" it 's a very sensitive issue , and these suits should be extremely case specific , extremely rare			2
... you ca n't win these cases , too much backlash , " @entity180 said			1
his advice to @entity126 : " move on with your life , remain above the scandal , and focus on school and following your dream to play in the @entity199			2
" i asked @entity180 what about the thousands of men who are wrongly accused -- just ignore them ? " look , i tell my clients innocent before proven guilty is not reality			1
it 's more of a marketing slogan to promote faith in our justice system ; without that premise , the system would fall apart , " he said			0
he also said it could " discourage too many from reporting real rapes			0
" it sounds to me like ancient history repeating itself			0
it sounds to me like we have a very long way to go before there 's justice for all .			0

@entity227 : 2 % to 8 % of rape accusations are " unfounded "
@entity230 : some men who insist they 've been falsely accused are suing accusers in civil court
@entity230 asks if @entity126 is innocent , should n't he sue his accuser to prove it ?
it 's more complicated than that , she says . you ca n't win , it could end in a backlash
