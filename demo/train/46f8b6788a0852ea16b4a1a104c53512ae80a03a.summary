editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 political analyst , is a nationally syndicated columnist and author of " listening to the @entity5 , " and the forthcoming book , " @entity7 : president @entity8 to the @entity9			1
" he is a commentator for @entity10 and host of a one - hour sunday morning news show			0
as a columnist , i 'm used to writing things that offend other folks			0
it comes with the job			0
and there are times when i have responded to what other folks in the media will say and write			0
again , it 's just what we do			1
there have been a number of things i 've read and heard over the past few months , but one that has totally ticked me off is the recent column by @entity34 's @entity33 in the march 22 issue of @entity36			1
@entity33 uses his column to personally attack @entity38 , the boys head basketball coach at @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41			1
in the despicable piece , @entity33 tries to link @entity38 with a fight in the parking lot after @entity45 destroyed archrival @entity46			1
apparently shots were fired , and in @entity33 's world , it 's all tied to @entity45 beating them 132 - 68			1
so i wonder if @entity33 blames @entity53 for @entity54 upsetting no. 4 ranked @entity55 , this leading to fans going bonkers -- some say riot -- and 28 people getting arrested			1
i 've seen folks fight after one - point losses ; that 's just what happens when dumb folks talk trash in the parking lot			1
they either duke it out with fists , or these days , pull out a gun to make their point			0
@entity33 then has the gall to say that the school district in @entity40 needs to intervene to " stop " @entity38 , even suggesting that @entity45 principal @entity77 should " grow a pair			1
" so what do you propose @entity33 ? tell him not to blow other teams out ? so the next time we see a 59 - 0 or 77 - 0 score in football , are we to scold the coach and tell him he will be suspended if his teams keeps scoring points ? should @entity87 have been put on administrative leave when his @entity89 destroyed my @entity90 77 - 0 ? in fact , last year @entity92 beat my @entity90 65 - 10			1
hey , @entity33 , was n't 45 , 50 , 60 or even 70 enough for @entity87 ? why 77 points ? the @entity95 of the world will remark that , " oh , these are poor high school students			1
their self - esteem will be hurt by this			0
yes , @entity45 has blown teams out by 50 , 60 and even 100 points			0
when you 're good , it happens			0
let me be clear : i 'm not objective on this issue			0
i graduated from @entity45 in 1987 , where i attended the @entity108 of communications			0
i watched @entity45 in 1985 win the football state championship by going undefeated and blowing out teams every week			0
that team set a state record for most points and set about another 20 records			2
they were just as dominating in football as this year 's basketball team			1
what wimps like @entity33 object to is @entity38 teaching his team to press , press and press			1
@entity45 used this strategy to win the @entity126 state championship last year , and this weekend will try to win another title			0
they play all 15 guys and rotate them in and out			0
they wear the opposing team out , forcing them to commit turnover after turnover			2
on the side of their championship rings is the slogan , " 32 minutes of hell			0
" it 's similar to what @entity141 's @entity140 teams were nicknamed , " 40 minutes of hell			2
' guys like @entity33 love to jump on the poor souls campaign			1
but i learned a long time ago that when you put on your uniform and lace ' em up , you stand a chance of getting your butt kicked			0
that 's all a part of the game			2
what guys like @entity33 also do n't understand is that their words matter			1
and by writing such a horrible piece about @entity38 , he is creating an impression in folks ' mind nationally about @entity38 , and that can hurt him down the road			0
right now i 'm reading @entity164 's book , " @entity165 : the @entity167 life of @entity141			2
" it tells the story of the famed @entity140 coach and the battles he had to fight to reach the top of the college basketball world			1
@entity164 tells the story of a number of black basketball coaches who never got a shot at the major jobs because of their race			2
he writes about how coaches like @entity141 were denigrated for the frantic style of play , and assumed it was all about talent and not about coaching			0
but he also told an interesting story of how so many talented coaches at historically black colleges never got a shot at major @entity192 coaching jobs because of their won - loss record			0
they were forced to take guaranteed money games against more talented teams , so when it was time for the @entity200 tournament , the teams had poor records , and that did n't reflect well on the coach			2
bottom line : the record of the coach played a role in getting their next job			2
and sportswriters , as @entity164 writes , tend to shape the views of the public based on what they write , and that can be damaging to anyone 's career			2
folks , for any college looking to revive their basketball team -- @entity141 took a dormant @entity221 team and won the @entity223 title and led them to the @entity200 -- @entity38 would be a great hire			1
his team finished 34 - 1 last year , and this year they are 32 - 0 , and with two games left , can claim back - to - back titles			2
are you telling me that a coach who is 66 - 1 in two years should be , as @entity33 wrote , " dipped in seal butter and dropped into a polar bear 's cage ? " no ! he should be celebrated for being successful			1
the game is about winning , right ? not only that , @entity45 has a great group of kids ( i 've met most of them )			0
they study , are polite , do n't get into trouble and are all - around good kids			0
at the end of the day , they are damn good and folks like @entity33 just do n't like it			1
by the way : @entity33 , who @entity34 pays a ton of dough , wrote this about @entity38 : " he tried to break the record for most 100 - point games in a row ( and failed )			1
" @entity33 , you are dead wrong			1
this past weekend , @entity45 scored 100 points for the 14th consecutive game , tying the national record set by @entity257 of @entity259 team in 1969 - 70			2
( on thursday night , they scored 106 points to set the new national record			0
) a simple fact check would have discovered that			0
it 's no surprise @entity33 was entirely wrong about @entity45 ' @entity38			1
he could not even get this basic fact right			0
@entity33 , use some of that fat @entity34 money , stop reading what others write about @entity45 , and take a simple trip down to @entity40 to see this mighty @entity45 team in person			1
you might learn a thing or two about a team that is full of class and the pride of @entity279			2
i 'm proud of these young men , and even more proud of their coach , who is a role model to them			0
is n't that what we want our coaches to be ? the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 's old high school has nation 's best basketball team
@entity33 of @entity34 wrote a column *blasting* coach for running up the score
@entity2 says there 's nothing wrong with the way team plays
