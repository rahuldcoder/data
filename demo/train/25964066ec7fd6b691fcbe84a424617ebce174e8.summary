@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 said tuesday that the deployment of 30,000 additional @entity6 troops to @entity7 is part of a strategy to reverse the @entity11 's momentum and stabilize the country 's government			1
" there is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown , but the @entity11 has gained momentum , " @entity3 said at the @entity14			1
" @entity19 has not re-emerged in @entity7 in the same numbers as before 9/11 , but they retain their safe - havens along the border			2
" and our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with @entity7 security forces and better secure the population			0
... in short , the status quo is not sustainable			0
" @entity3 said he 'd begin sending the additional troops " at the fastest pace possible " starting in early 2010 " with a goal of starting to withdraw forces from the country in july 2011			2
" the president said additional @entity6 forces bolstered by @entity41 troops " will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to @entity7 forces			1
" senior administration officials said tuesday that @entity3 has a goal of withdrawing most @entity6 forces by the end of his current term , which ends in january 2013			1
watch what the new troops will do in @entity7 it will be the second increase of @entity6 forces in the war - torn @entity51 country ordered by @entity3 since he took office in january			1
in his speech tuesday , @entity3 said his strategy had three objectives : @entity57 a safe haven reverse the @entity11 's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow @entity7 's government strengthen @entity7 's security forces and government the additional troops was one way to achieve these , he said			1
other strategies will include holding @entity7 government leaders accountable for corruption , focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of @entity7 , and securing the country 's border with @entity76			2
" we are in @entity7 to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country			0
but this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of @entity76			0
that is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border , " @entity3 said			0
the president said he rejected the option of committing more forces for an undefined mission of nation - building without any deadlines			0
" i reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost , and what we need to achieve to secure our interests , " @entity3 said			2
" furthermore , the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the @entity7 government			2
it must be clear that @entity7 will have to take responsibility for their security , and that @entity6 has no interest in fighting an endless war in @entity7			1
" @entity3 rejected analogies with the war in @entity113 that divided @entity6 in the 1960s and 1970s			2
" unlike @entity113 , we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action , " @entity3 said			0
" unlike @entity113 , we are not facing a broad - based popular insurgency			0
and most importantly , unlike @entity113 , the @entity6 people were viciously attacked from @entity7 , and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border			2
" @entity3 said the @entity6 has no interest in occupying @entity7			1
" we will support efforts by the @entity7 government to open the door to those @entity11 who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens , " @entity3 said			1
" and we will seek a partnership with @entity7 grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy ; to strengthen those who build ; to hasten the day when our troops will leave ; and to forge a lasting friendship in which @entity6 is your partner , and never your patron			1
" @entity3 spoke to an audience of @entity0 cadets , staff and guests in outlining his strategy that he has deliberated for months , meeting several times with his national security team			0
he recognized that some in the audience had fought in @entity7 , and some would be deployed in the future			0
" as your commander in chief , i owe you a mission that is clearly defined , and worthy of your service , " he said			0
the additional @entity6 forces " will increase our ability to train competent @entity7 security forces , and to partner with them so that more @entity7 can get into the fight , " @entity3 said			1
" and they will help create the conditions for the @entity6 to transfer responsibility to the @entity7			1
" @entity3 also said he is asking @entity41 allies to provide more troops , and that he is " confident that there will be further contributions in the days ahead			0
" " our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in @entity7 , " he said			0
" now , we must come together to end this war successfully			0
for what 's at stake is not simply a test of @entity41 's credibility -- what 's at stake is the security of our allies , and the common security of the world			0
" the new troop deployment would increase the total @entity6 commitment to roughly 100,000 troops in @entity7 , bolstered by more than 40,000 @entity41 forces			1
@entity3 , whom @entity184 had accused of " dithering " over the decision , concluded the deployment needs to be accelerated to knock back the @entity11 , the senior officials said			1
the push for a speedy deployment is surprising because @entity190 officials who defended @entity3 's slow pace of coming to a decision had said the @entity193 would n't be able to get new troops to @entity7 that quickly			1
a @entity193 official noted that , under the new strategy , @entity3 is " trying to do it faster " than the 12 - month timeline initially requested by gen. @entity198 , the top @entity6 commander in @entity7			1
@entity198 wrote in a report in august that a " failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the near - term ( next 12 months ) -- while @entity7 security capacity matures -- risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible			1
" the @entity193 official said @entity3 's six - month timeline for sending the new troops is " very aggressive " and will be challenging for the military to fulfill			2
the official expressed confidence , however , that the military would successfully carry out the order			0
opponents of an increased @entity6 troop deployment complain that the government of @entity7 president @entity215 is corrupt and an unreliable partner			2
@entity3 spoke to @entity215 for an hour by videoconference tuesday to discuss the deployment decision , according to a @entity190 statement			0
" the president also emphasized that @entity6 and international efforts in @entity7 are not open - ended and must be evaluated toward measurable and achievable goals within the next 18 to 24 months , " the statement said			1
share your views on @entity3 's @entity7 decision the decision to send the troops carries significant political risk for @entity3 , who will announce it nine days before he travels to @entity230 , @entity231 , to accept the @entity232			1
his liberal base , which helped him win last year 's presidential election , opposes another troop deployment to @entity7			0
in addition , the deployment , expected to cost an extra $ 30 billion a year , comes amid high unemployment as the economy emerges from a recession			0
that concerns @entity242 and @entity184 faced with competing domestic priorities such as health care reform and job creation			0
@entity6 - led troops first invaded @entity7 in response to the @entity57 terrorist network 's september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity1 and @entity250			1
the invasion overthrew the ruling @entity11 , which had allowed @entity57 to operate from its territory , but most of the top @entity57 and @entity11 leadership escaped the onslaught			2
@entity11 fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along @entity7 's border with @entity76 , battling @entity6 and @entity7 government forces on one side and @entity76 troops on the other			1
@entity19 's top leaders , @entity264 and @entity265 , remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region			0
the conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 @entity6 and nearly 600 allied troops .			0
