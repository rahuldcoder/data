-- when an anonymous donor gave art to the @entity4 as an early holiday gift this month , the staff thought it was junk			1
" across the board they thought it was ugly , " said @entity6 , who sorts the art and collectibles donated at @entity4 in @entity8 , @entity9			1
co-workers told her : " what is that ? and why would anybody want that ? " the art is actually a @entity20 original , by the master surrealist who in his day relished the role of public provocateur with his mind - bending imagery			1
the work is a colored etching , and the framed piece even features the familiar @entity20 motif of a melting watch , placed on the wrist of a pointing hand			1
its title is " reflection " or " reflections , " from " @entity37 , " and the art is signed by @entity20 and numbered " 126/150			1
" the work is also labeled as an " etching and photolithography from collage			0
" @entity6 was familiar with @entity20 , and she researched the work and its attached letter of authenticity			2
she confirmed she had something special , though several co-workers knew nothing of the surrealist , not even his famously flamboyant moustache			0
@entity51 painting returned from abroad " this is probably the real deal , " @entity6 said of her discovery of the @entity20 work			2
" the manager knew who he was right away , and we were both really excited			0
" @entity4 is now auctioning the art on its website			1
as of late friday afternoon , the bidding reached $ 10,505			2
goodwill has noted that the artwork 's paper " has some warping , as if from humidity , " with some discolored speckling to one part of the matting and a few deep scratches and scuffs to the glass and frame , the website says			2
the online auction ends monday at 7:30 p.m. @entity74			0
goodwill does n't know the donor , who managed to sneak away during a busy time at the drop - off facility , @entity6 said			2
but the donor kept intact the back of the frame , which contained an envelope with a certificate of authenticity and registration number from a defunct gallery in @entity86 , @entity87			0
an appraiser retained by @entity4 also confirmed the authenticity of the @entity20 , and the charitable organization also ensured the art was n't stolen , said @entity92 , spokeswoman for goodwill in @entity93 , @entity9			1
the nonprofit provides employment and training programs to people with disabilities and disadvantages , and the group sells donated goods in more than 2,600 stores			0
goodwill held on to the @entity20 for a week in case someone claimed it was accidentally donated , @entity92 said			2
" we do n't know the background of what the circumstances were , " @entity92 said of the donation			0
" it 's a steady stream of people coming in			0
it 's not necessarily documented what every person comes in with			0
" about 74 million people in the @entity116 and @entity117 donate annually to @entity4 , @entity92 said			0
" we have a very busy donation door , and we have several people who work that door , " @entity6 said , explaining how the donor was able to remain unknown			0
when a signed piece of art arrives at a donation center , @entity4 sets it aside for special review , @entity6 said			1
most donated goods are sold at @entity129 , but prizes such as the @entity20 are auctioned online -- to maximize their value , said @entity6 , who works for @entity4 's online department			1
the @entity20 is the highlight of her past six years of working for the nonprofit , in addition to her two years of service in the 1970s , she said			0
until this month , the biggest donations she oversaw were professional 35 - mm cameras that fetched $ 8,400 on @entity4 's auction website , she said			1
to the anonymous donor , @entity6 , 58 , offered a message : " i would say thank you for helping us with our mission because we have a lot of programs that put people to work , and it 's people right here in the communities			1
" the bidding for the @entity20 piece is still short of the most prized art auctioned by @entity4 : a @entity155 oil painting , dated 1924 and also donated anonymously , was sold online by @entity4 in 2006 for $ 165,002 .			1
