-- i recently watched images of president @entity3 and gov. @entity4 pledging to work together to get emergency aid to @entity8 's victims as quickly as possible			1
gov. @entity9 , you 'll recall , gave the keynote address at the @entity12 and spent a fair amount of time lambasting @entity3 during the campaign			1
but as they toured the damaged coastline together , i thought that many women watching across the country would be moved by the leadership of these two men and their willingness to transcend their partisan differences			2
a @entity23 seemed to confirm this : 26 % of women nationally -- more than men , at 18 % -- reported that @entity3 's handling of the hurricane response would be a major factor in determining their vote for president			1
politicians take note : women are often motivated by different things than men			1
opinion : women gain wider access to power and with their votes in tuesday 's election , women sent important messages to president @entity3 and to leaders of both parties			1
a majority of women voted to re-elect the president , while a slightly smaller majority of men voted for @entity52 , according to exit polls			2
@entity3 also won a majority of women 's votes , with @entity52 winning a majority of men 's , in critical battleground states such as @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , and @entity65			1
why did women and men vote this way ? the answer lies in part in their different views about government and the role it should play in our lives			2
first , women were voting for a more affirmative role on the part of the federal government			0
men , more than women , have long said they favor dramatic cutbacks in the size of government			0
women , more than men , worry that cutbacks will go too far ; they are concerned with preserving @entity88 's social safety net for those in needâ € ” programs such as @entity91 , school lunches and child nutrition programs , and @entity94 for elderly and disabled individuals			1
this will be particularly important as president @entity3 and @entity97 work on a deal to save the country from falling off the fiscal cliff			0
women will be watching to make sure that the basic social infrastructure is not threatened			0
second , women care about their own health and welfare , and that of their families and other @entity88			0
consequently , they denied their votes to candidates that showed extremism on issues such as abortion and contraception and backed those who supported women 's right to control their reproductive decisions			2
nowhere was this more apparent than in the @entity120 contests in @entity122 and @entity123 , two conservative states where voters strongly preferred @entity52 in the presidential race			0
but in the @entity120 race the majority of women voted for @entity130 @entity129 , while only about a third voted for @entity132 @entity131 , who in a discussion of his no - exceptions policy on abortion , said in a televised interview in august that " if it 's a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down			2
" similarly , in @entity123 , a majority of women voted for @entity130 @entity144 , helping him defeat @entity132 @entity145 , who said in a @entity120 debate that " even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape , that is something that @entity151 intended to happen			0
" women 's personal views on abortion may vary , but few are not offended by extreme statements like these			0
women voters , in general , would prefer that lawmakers devote their energy to solving the nation 's economic problems rather than regulating and restricting women 's access to contraception and their ability to make reproductive choices			1
finally , women want strong leaders who can work across party lines to solve problems -- which brings us back to @entity9 and @entity3			1
women who were moved by @entity3 's actions along the @entity173 would likely be pleased if he showed the same kind of unifying leadership in @entity176			1
that may in part be why they helped reelect him			0
and they would be equally pleased to see @entity97 set aside its petty bickering and partisan gamesmanship and work with the president to solve the very grave problems our country confronts			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			0

@entity188 : @entity3 , @entity9 working together after @entity8 *resonated* for women voters
she says it 's because women motivated by different things -- like *cooperation* -- than men
she says women voters sent message . first , they want strong social safety net
@entity202 : women *reject* extremism , particularly on reproduction , want problem - solving leaders
