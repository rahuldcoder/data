-- once upon a time , bookshelves were just for books , a spot to proudly show off your full set of encyclopedias before the advent of @entity8			1
these days , homeowners have a more open - minded approach to their shelving			1
the books are still there , but decorating enthusiasts are using them as elements of decor			1
@entity21 magazine editor - in - chief @entity18 said that 's because finding colorful and affordable home accessories is a lot easier than it used to be			1
as a result , " restyling your bookshelves can be a fast makeover that can totally change the look and feel of a room , " @entity18 said			1
in addition to being a collection of well - loved stories , a stack of books can serve as a base for decorative objects			2
" the key to styling out bookshelves is to have a wide variety of objects to play with , " she said			1
all different sizes of books , vases , boxes and framed photos bring a bookcase to life			2
not only that , but the shelves themselves can be part of the arrangement			2
" we 're also seeing people line the backs of the bookshelves with wallpaper or even painting the backs , which gives everything on the shelves more of a cohesive look , " @entity18 said			1
the possibilities seem endless , and therein lies the problem , said e-designer @entity67			2
communicating via @entity69 , phone and e-mail , @entity68 provides interior designs and blueprints for her clients around the world to implement on their own			2
when it comes to decorating shelves , the instructions she provides come with an encouragement to be patient			1
" styling bookshelves is always a tricky process , " @entity67 said			1
" it looks easy but it takes finessing			1
" it 's about balancing the size of the objects placed on the entire bookshelf , she said , paying attention to scale and shape			1
for example , @entity67 places larger decorative items on the top and bottom shelves while keeping items with intricate detail on eye level			2
and since books and picture frames are often rectangular , she breaks up all the angles with other shapes to keep things interesting			2
here 's what @entity106 contributors learned about decorating their own bookcases : -- " i learned that large bookcases eat up accessories			1
i had what i thought was more than enough to fill the shelves			2
it turned out i needed more ! " -- @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116			2
-- " i love seeing bookcases packed full of books , pictures and collectibles in other people 's homes			1
however , i prefer a cleaner , simpler style in my house			1
when there are tons of objects in a bookcase , it can overload the senses and not be relaxing			0
" -- @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133			0
-- " for this bookshelf , i found it helpful to have a wide assortment of objects on the floor in front and then start placing objects ( on the shelves )			1
that way everything is easy to reach and move around			1
" -- @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145			0
-- " @entity146 are natural and sculptural , and i like to showcase them as art. i found mine at a flea market			0
they are definitely a conversation starter when we have guests			0
they also look really cool at night when the library lights are on			0
" -- @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160			0
" i was pleasantly surprised by how finished the shelves looked when we added the glass doors			0
we 'd originally planned to add molding to them to give them a built - in look , but we found we preferred the modern feel the glass doors gave them			0
" -- @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171			0
-- " we have a lot of books , so we need to use our bookshelves for real storage , not just a place to put pretty things that need to be dusted			0
i found everything looks a little less busy if you loosely organize books by color and mix in some meaningful , pretty things			0
" -- @entity183 , @entity184			0
-- " the thing i learned when i set out to decorate these bookshelves was an important one : that with a little bit of effort you can transform something that may not be your style , or in this case , may even have lingering memories associated with it , and make it truly and uniquely your own			1
" -- @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199			0
" i really try to consider how much i love something before i display it			0
using the rule of thumb , ' if you make everything special , then really nothing is special ' " -- @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207			0
" i love playing with ( the bookshelf )			1
... i will be making small changes to take it from @entity211 to more of a @entity213 theme as november approaches			0
" -- @entity215 , @entity216 .			0
