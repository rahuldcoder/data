-- " @entity1 " wants to raise the stakes and improve upon its signature art style and outlandish weapons while broadening the story on the planet of @entity7			1
at a hands - on demo , a pre-alpha build of the new title showed off two classes of characters -- one new and one familiar			1
it also demonstrated how the development team at @entity16 learned and applied lessons from its first title and subsequent downloadable content releases			2
the " @entity21 " class is all about the weapons -- the more , the merrier			2
this tank of a character can wield two weapons at once , bringing more firepower to fights and dishing out the pain			2
the best combinations featured one weapon that could bring rapid fire , but deliver light damage , while wielding another that brought serious hurt , but took its time to fire			2
working together , the two different types of weapons created a consistent kill zone for creatures -- no matter how strong or numerous they were			2
the other class available for play was the " @entity44			2
" this class was featured in " @entity7 " and offered phasewalking ( turning intangible ) as its special talent			1
this time , @entity44 has the ability to trap foes in a force field hovering in midair , making them easy targets for damage			2
the art style remains the same as in the original , with its familiar hand - painted look and dark outlines			1
@entity16 producer @entity59 said the team wanted to improve what it had done to make the characters look great , then extend that look to the surrounding environment			0
it 's almost water - colored with those really harsh , dark edges			1
just like you would see in a comic book , " @entity59 said			0
" a lot of it is drawn right on to the texture models themselves			0
we have a very distinct art style and art guide that all of our artists adhere to			1
" the action takes place five years after the conclusion of " @entity7 " and introduces a new villain to the mix , @entity84			1
@entity59 said bringing an antagonist to the plot gave the team more options to make the story personal for the players			0
" why is he mining ? what is he mining in the planet ? why is that so much more important than finding a vault ( the final object in the first game ) ? " he said			0
" having a villain puts a personal face on it			0
are you racing him for the treasure ? are you trying to keep it from him ? " @entity59 said giving the players a focus also helps flesh out the game 's characters and what motivates them			0
the whole idea was to make the story richer and more fulfilling without changing too much of the gameplay that fans enjoyed			0
senior producer @entity111 echoed those sentiments and said community involvement in the first title and its three downloadable updates was important in figuring out what gamers liked and what worked best			1
invoking @entity120 and @entity119 during the interview , @entity111 acknowledged there were problems they had n't foreseen until after the games were made , but they were things that could be corrected for " @entity1			1
" " in ' @entity7 , ' ( designers thought ) it was just a fact that as a four - player ( co-op ) game , the vehicle had two seats , " he said			1
" you do n't see it as a problem			0
you think they can use two vehicles and everyone likes to drive			0
turns out , it is an elephant ( a problem ) , and you 've got to fix that			0
" little refinements , he hopes , will make the gameplay and the experience even more enjoyable for fans of the franchise as well as new players who are seeing @entity7 for the first time			1
@entity111 built his development team out of people who had worked on the series as well as new talent that he felt were the best at what they do			0
he said it was about having confidence in the people who were putting the game together , trusting them and believing they were smarter than he was about their areas of expertise			0
" get the right people , give them the right mission , get enough resources to do the job , make sure they 're inspired and get out of the way , " he said			0
more than 200 unique types of creatures will be in the way of players as they work their way through the game quests and other missions			0
there are also named creatures who will offer additional challenges -- and loot for those who defeat them			0
also , mechanical enemies are prominent in the game , in addition to all the natural wildlife you can battle on @entity7			1
the player characters from " @entity7 " will also show up in the new game as nonplayer characters , providing backstory and missions for the gamers to complete			1
@entity59 said " @entity1 " is significantly larger , broader and deeper than its predecessor			1
gamers will have to wait until september 18 to find out if this game is more enjoyable than the first .			1

the art style remains the same , with familiar hand - painted looks and dark outlines
the action takes place five years after the conclusion of " @entity7 "
gamers will have to wait until september 18 to get their hands on " @entity1 "
