-- in times of despair , a good meal goes a long way			2
the week of april 15 brought two horrific events : the @entity7 bombings and the @entity8 , @entity9 , fertilizer plant explosion			1
in each city , health care workers jumped into action to help victims of the tragedies			1
in between trying to save lives , these doctors and nurses somehow found the time to support their colleagues across the country			2
what started as a single act of kindness turned into a culinary exchange that shows just how inspiring " paying it forward " can be			0
in the aftermath of the @entity7 blasts , @entity27 , a registered nurse at the medical intensive care unit at @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , wanted nurses in @entity35 to know that the nurses at her hospital were thinking about them			1
during the pre-shift morning huddle on april 20 , she asked if anyone would be willing to chip in a couple of dollars to order food for @entity44 's medical intensive care unit			1
the response was larger than she expected : $ 126 , which she used to have pizza delivered to the @entity35 health care workers			1
" i think doing things like this is important , " @entity49 said			0
" in this day and age , we 've forgotten how to be kind to other people ... and take care of each other			2

... " " it was an absolute surprise , " said @entity79 , vice president of operations at @entity68			0
" @entity82 ( emergency department ) obviously was blown away			1
" attempts by @entity0 to reach @entity65 for comment were unsuccessful			0
after the @entity44 @entity88 staff received their pizzas from @entity31 , they also reached out to @entity68 , sending lunch and dinner to the @entity9 hospital 's icu on april 21			1
a lot of nurses at @entity68 were personally affected by the explosion and had relatives who were injured or lost their homes , so gestures such as this gift " really show the human spirit , " @entity79 said			2
the chain of support did n't stop there			0
enter @entity105 , also known as " the @entity106			1
" he runs a mobile barbecue restaurant called the @entity108 and grill , and a stationary establishment called @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity9			1

@entity35 amputee victims urged to ' slay the monster ' with recovery " i just decided , you know what , let 's go help , " @entity105 said			1
one of the volunteers in @entity8 was @entity126 , whose husband works at @entity68 as a surgeon			0
she told @entity105 about the pizzas that had been sent from the @entity44 emergency department team to @entity68			1
@entity105 decided to help @entity9 return the favor			1
at 4 a.m. tuesday , @entity105 got on a plane to bring barbecue to more than 200 emergency department personnel at @entity44			1
@entity134 allowed @entity105 and his team to fly to @entity35 for free with 50 racks of ribs and 15 briskets			2
several staff members at @entity44 wore cowboy boots for the occasion			2
a few had tears in their eyes as they dug in , @entity105 said			0
" it was unbelievable , " he said			0
" we were tired -- we cooked for three days straight , 18 hours a day			0
i was tired and i was just feeding people			0
i knew these doctors had been working countless hours			0
... they had n't been eating and had n't been sleeping			0
" @entity105 gave @entity65 a @entity9 flag that had traveled the country on @entity105 's mobile smoker			2
the barbecue ambassadors also brought with them a large green @entity68 hospital flag , signed by as many as 500 staff members who wrote encouraging messages on it			1
while the @entity35 health care team enjoyed their barbecue , their counterparts at @entity68 skyped with them , @entity79 said			1
the next day @entity68 received a lithograph of @entity44 , which is now displayed in the administrative area of the emergency department			1
" you share a common bond , especially in such a trying time , " @entity79 said			0
" the whole situation has been extremely therapeutic , i think on both sides , and just so uplifting			0
" @entity105 will continue to pay it forward			0
he 's convinced his corporate sponsors , such as @entity170 and @entity171 , to deliver food every week for the next month to emergency workers in @entity8			2
" in this crazy world that we live in nowadays ... it just seems right , " he said			0
" we 're all just doing our duty as people , as human beings			0
" bombings destroy dancer 's foot , but not her spirit			0
