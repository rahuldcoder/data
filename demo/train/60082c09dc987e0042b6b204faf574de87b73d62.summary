-- @entity1 first , the rest nowhere			2
@entity1 won the @entity3 , the opening race of @entity5 , in spectacular style on tuesday , smashing a classy field by 11 lengths to reassert his claims to be recognized as the world 's best racehorse			1
the fans have come in their droves to @entity5 this week to see another wonder horse , @entity15 , the @entity17 superstar who will make her appearance here on saturday			2
but the performance of the week - arguably the performance of the year - has already been seen here			0
it might just be the race to end all races as the unbeaten @entity1 recorded his 11th successive victory			1
the sir @entity25 - trained four - year - old was sent off at odds of 1 - 10 on tuesday , meaning a $ 10 bet would earn you just $ 1 profit			1
in hindsight , those odds seemed like a good deal			0
long time rival @entity34 , whom @entity1 beat by a comfortable five lengths at @entity38 in may , had been given orders not to let @entity1 open up ground			2
despite the best efforts of @entity34 's jockey , @entity43 , those orders soon proved futile			0
once @entity45 , @entity1 's jockey , opened the tap there was no way any other horse was going to get close to @entity1 , the giant bay increasing his lead with every one of his all - devouring strides			1
still in full flow as he passed the winning post , it is hard to recall a performance like his by any horse in recent memory			0
" breathtaking " , " astonishing " , " brilliant " were just some of the milder adjectives murmured by appreciative fans , even the inexperienced racegoers among them sensing they were witnessing something extraordinary			0
is @entity1 the greatest racehorse of all time ? probably			1
will we ever see his likes again ? do n't bet on it .			0
