-- as the april 15 income tax filing deadline approaches , the top tax expert at the @entity3 for the @entity4 offers his best advice for business people who work for themselves			1
@entity8 , a national tax adviser at the association , answers the tax question he is asked most often and talks about changes in tax rules for small - business owners			1
he also offers advice about how the self - employed can best avoid being audited by the @entity17			1
@entity0 : what should self - employed taxpayers keep at the top of their minds this year ? @entity8 : i think the most important thing to remember is that you have resources			1
the @entity17 is always changing information -- from automobile deductions , to alternative minimum tax limits , to net operating loss carry - forwards			1
it 's tough to keep up with , but you do n't have to remember it , because it 's all out there on the @entity17 web site for you			1
do n't forget , you 've got resources to go out and look for			0
@entity0 : what 's different this year for self - employed taxpayers ? hall : perhaps the most important thing unique to this year is there are so many businesses which were affected by the downturn in the economy , that the @entity17 has expanded opportunities for loss carrybacks			1
the definition of a loss carryback is if you had losses from your business in 2009 , then you may have the opportunity to then take those losses and offset income from previous years			0
that 's certainly something to look into if you had a tough year for 2009 , because it may give you the ability to recover taxes in more years -- namely five -- than you used to be able to , which is just two			0
so if that 's the situation that you find yourself in , certainly look into options for those loss carrybacks			0
it certainly can help you with the tax impact			0
more particularly , for those new to being self - employed or maybe even their first year filing a @entity65 , make sure you look for deductions that do n't appear in your business checkbook			1
it 's very easy to overlook deductions like the deduction for the home office that you use , deduction for the business use of your automobile -- those typically do n't show up in your business checkbook , so if you do n't know to look for them , they 're very easily overlooked , and that 's basically just leaving money on the table			1
@entity0 : what can self - employed workers do to avoid an @entity17 audit ? hall : the no. 1 reason a small business gets audited or asked for additional information by the @entity17 is simple math errors -- the numbers simply do n't add up correctly on the form			1
whether you use @entity91 or @entity92 or the @entity17 online filing , it 's a great idea -- particularly for the new small business -- to make sure you use that software package -- if nothing else -- just to make sure those math errors are eliminated			1
do n't be too afraid of an @entity17 audit			2
obviously , when people think in terms of the @entity17 , they get a little bit antsy			2
nobody likes to get that letter in the mailbox on saturday morning that 's got an @entity17 return address in the upper left - hand corner			2
but if you do , the best thing to keep in mind is pay attention to your tax return			0
do the due diligence that you need to to avoid the little shortcuts of filling in numbers that you do n't have support for			2
if you just take the time to pay attention to the business and do the tax return the way you should , there 's nothing to be afraid of with that audit			0
so at a very minimum -- just to ease the stress of that potential letter you 're going to get form the @entity17 -- just make sure you take the extra time to use resources like @entity128 , like the @entity17 web site at irs.gov , and just make sure you dot your @entity131 's and cross your @entity132			0
and then , if you do get a request from the @entity17 , it wo n't be stressful			2
@entity0 : what are some important tax law changes for tax year 2009 ? hall : always be aware that every year , the @entity17 changes something			2
for example , automobile mileage : the new rate for 2009 is 55 cents			1
make sure you get that one correct			0
the @entity17 always changes the adjusted limits for alternative minimum tax			2
for the standard itemized deductions , all those levels are adjusted for inflation			0
make sure that you get those right numbers			0
using an automated software program -- having that system in place -- will help you keep up with any of those changes that occur as a matter of course with the @entity17 every year			0
@entity0 : what 's the most frequent tax question you get asked ? hall : the first question we typically get , particularly at tax return time , is " what can i do right now to save money on last year 's tax return ? " most tax planning ideas really end with the @entity165			2
but the one thing you can do today to save money on your taxes for last year is to consider making a retirement plan contribution -- whether it 's a traditional @entity171 contribution , a self - employed pension plan contribution , lots of different ways to put money away for your own future			1
the @entity17 recognizes how important that is , and they 'll even give you a tax deduction for it			1
so you can actually reduce the taxes you have to pay right now , just by putting money away for your own future			0
that 's certainly something that should be considered			0
@entity0 : should we expect future tax breaks for small businesses ? hall : the current administration and both sides of the @entity189 and @entity190 all promote the growth of jobs through small business			0
the influences of small business in generating jobs -- which are more and more important these days -- is only going to increase the influence of small business			0
whether it 's legislation for a standard home office deduction , which is pending , legislation for additional health credits and concentration on affordability for health care for the self - employed , which is also pending , there 's lots of legislation out there to benefit small business			1
the more and more small businesses we have , i think more emphasis in @entity213 and at the state level will focus on benefits for the self - employed .			1

use @entity17 to avoid mistakes , says top tax expert at *advocacy* group for self - employed
how to save tax money right now ? consider retirement contributions
look for deductions that do n't appear in your business checkbook
