@entity0 -- a top congressional @entity2 on sunday criticized president @entity4 's expected decision to reverse the @entity7 administration 's limits on embryonic stem - cell research , calling it a distraction from the country 's economic slump			1
@entity13 rep. @entity12 also says the policy reversal could lead to embryo harvesting , which " should n't be done			1
" " why are we going and distracting ourselves from the economy ? this is job no. 1			0
let 's focus on what needs to be done , " rep. @entity12 , the @entity2 whip in the @entity21 , told @entity1 's " @entity24			1
" @entity4 's move , scheduled for monday morning , is part of a broader effort to separate science and politics and " restore scientific integrity in governmental decision - making , " @entity26 domestic policy adviser @entity25 said sunday			1
the @entity7 administration 's 2001 policy bars federal funding for research on embryonic stem cells beyond the cell lines that existed at the time			1
@entity12 , @entity41 , has been among the leaders of @entity2 opposition to @entity4 's economic policies			2
in a conference call with reporters , @entity25 said funding research is also part of the administration 's plan to boost the plunging @entity13 economy			2
" advances with regard to science and technology help advance our overall national goals around economic growth and job creation , " she said , adding , " i think anytime you make an effort to try and separate these pieces of the puzzle , you 're missing the entire picture			0
" because stem cells have the potential to turn into any organ or tissue cell in the body , research advocates say they could yield cures to debilitating conditions such as diabetes , parkinson 's disease and spinal injuries			1
but because work on embryonic stem cells involves the destruction of human embryos , many conservatives supported the limits former president @entity7 imposed by executive order in 2001			1
" frankly , federal funding of embryonic stem - cell research can bring on embryo harvesting , perhaps even human cloning that occurs , " @entity12 said			1
" we do n't want that			0
that should n't be done			0
" the @entity7 policy limited federal funding to work on 60 existing stem - cell lines , but only 21 of those have proven useful to researchers			1
@entity96 voted to roll back those limits in 2006 and 2007 , but @entity7 vetoed the legislation both times , leading to @entity101 charges that he had put politics over science			2
dr. @entity104 , president of @entity105 and co-chairman of @entity4 's science advisory council , said sunday that @entity4 will " endorse the notion that public policy must be guided by sound , scientific advice			2
" @entity4 's order will direct the @entity113 to develop revised guidelines on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research within 120 days , said @entity104 , who joined @entity25 in the conference call with reporters			1
" the president is , in effect , allowing federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research to the extent that it 's permitted by law -- that is , work with stem cells themselves , not the derivation of stem cells , " he said			1
supporters of the ban said researchers could still obtain private funding or explore alternatives such as adult stem cells			2
opponents said the research could be carried out using embryos left over in fertility clinics , which otherwise would be discarded			0
sen. @entity139 , @entity140 , told reporters that reversing the @entity7 ban would " once again say to the rest of the world that we will be the beacon for cures and for hope			0
" she credited her support for federal funding in part for her 2006 election			0
" i think it 's a great moment , and i 'm proud of [ @entity4 ] for reversing that executive order , " @entity139 said			0
sen. @entity155 , @entity156 , said the @entity7 policy imposed ethical limits on science			2
" my basic tenet here is i do n't think we should create life to enhance life and to do research and so forth , " @entity155 said			0
" i know that people argue there are other ways			0
i think we should continue our biomedical research everywhere we can , but we should have some ethics about it			0
" @entity1 's @entity172 contributed to this report .			0
