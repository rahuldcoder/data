the tour bus bounces along one of @entity3 's potholed roads , pop music blasting out over the speakers			1
it 's a catchy tune and even though none of the tourists can understand the lyrics , a few are tapping their feet to the beat			2
the hit song , " without a break , " is by @entity15 , by far @entity3 's most popular band			1
the driver is clearly a fan and plays the dvd several times a day			2
most tourists are busy looking out the window and pay little attention to the video screened at the front of the bus			2
they do n't notice the nuclear missile being launched behind the all - girl band , nor do they see it smash into our little blue planet , blowing up the @entity30			0
" ' without a break ' is about the nuclear destruction of the @entity36 , " says @entity32 @entity31 , who has visited @entity3 four times			1
" tourists dance to it because they do n't know the lyrics , they do n't know what the song is about			2
" travel to @entity3 raises a number of sticky issues , not least of all the ethical issue of supporting a repressive regime			1
for those who opt to go , it 's an opportunity to glimpse one of the most isolated , unfathomable and feared countries in the world			0
" there have been about 6,000 @entity56 tourists this year -- that 's a tenfold increase on a decade ago , " says @entity53 general manager @entity52			1
but when you sign up to visit the @entity3 you have to play by their rules			1
there are strict guidelines in place about what you can and can not do			1
break with the protocol -- or even be suspected of it -- and not just you but the rest of your group will be sent back early			0
or worse , as @entity36 military veteran @entity70 discovered			0
according to his family , the @entity72 , @entity73 , resident had gone on a 10 - day organized private tour of @entity3 in october			1
from phone calls and postcards he sent , the trip was going well and there was no indication of any kind of problem , son @entity76 said			0
the day before he was to leave , " one or two @entity3 authorities " met with @entity70 and his tour guide , the son added			1
they talked about @entity70 's service record , which left " my dad ... a bit bothered , " according to @entity76			0
then , just minutes before his @entity91 - bound plane was set to depart @entity92 in late october , he was taken off the aircraft by @entity3 authorities			1
more : @entity36 ' deeply concerned ' about citizens held in @entity3 , including @entity70 getting into @entity3 unless you 're invited as part of a business delegation , the only way to visit @entity3 is by joining a tour			1
depending on the number of tourists and whether or not it includes @entity36 , two to three trained guides - cum - minders accompany each group			2
aside from the hotels where tourists can roam freely between their room , the bar and the restaurant , a guide accompanies visitors at all times			1
the guides are friendly and accommodating			0
they go out of their way to keep their charges happy -- singing songs and ensuring there is plenty to eat and drink			0
the lavish meals , with a big spread put out for every meal , is all part of the package			0
the @entity3 wants westerners to return home raving about how much they were given to eat			1
@entity36 @entity131 , a lawyer , has visited @entity3 twice and says he liked the guides and asked plenty of questions , but was frustrated when he did n't get a straight answer			1
" their job was to tell us whatever the government wanted us to hear , even if it contradicted what we could see from the bus window , " he says			0
more : touring @entity3 : what 's real , what 's fake ? @entity144 , a @entity145 localization expert for a computer game company in @entity147 , says he got a lot more out of his second trip to @entity3 because he had a better grasp of what was going on			1
he did some research -- mostly online , reading blogs and scouring @entity155 images -- ahead of his second visit to the remote @entity157 of the country and was wise on what to look out for in the region			0
" do n't worry about being lied to , worry about not getting the interesting information , " says @entity144			0
" guides repeat certain random things a dozen times , but when you drive right past the entrance to a concentration camp they wo n't tell you			2
" if you do n't want to bow , stay home a key aspect of any trip to @entity3 is the need to show reverence for past and present leaders			1
this means not only referring to them with respect , but also bowing in front of the statues of @entity179 and @entity180			0
@entity92 has a number of statues , so this can mean laying flowers and bowing several times on a week - long trip			2
for those traveling around the country , there 's a @entity179 statue in every city			0
@entity53 , the longest running and most specialized travel company for the @entity3 , advises tourists in their briefing notes that they will be expected to bow in front of the statues and warns : " if you are not willing to behave at some points as expected by the local customs then we recommend you do not visit the @entity3 , the potential for offense to be taken by the hosts which then adversely affects the tour is too great			1

repeat visitors to the @entity3 quickly realize that the best way to get the most out of a trip is to stick to the rules			1
there 's little point grilling the guides about politics or gulags because you wo n't get a straight answer			0
every tour is a carefully choreographed affair , designed to show the country in its best light , but much can gleaned on the drive between approved tourists sites			1
it 's especially interesting when unexpected events force a sudden change of plan			0
@entity32 tourist @entity31 was on a tour of the north east when road works meant the bus had to take a side road through an old village			2
" the guides got very flustered because all of a sudden they could n't use the road they knew was safe for us to travel , " says @entity31			2
" they even got off the bus and tried to reason with the construction guys , they were incredibly nervous			0
" more : behind the veil : rare look at life in @entity3 he compares a tour of the @entity3 to the film " @entity251			1
" the occasional glitches in the tour , say when the bus breaks down and is forced to make an impromptu stop , are like the scene in the film when the cat walks through twice -- a crack in the @entity251			2

@entity266 , a @entity267 tourist who visited @entity268 for the first time this summer , says it 's one of the safest places he 's ever visited			2
" there are n't many countries where you can leave your bag loaded with cash , cameras and passports and know that it 'll be there when you return , " says @entity266			0
travel blogger @entity281 weighed up the pros and cons of visiting on his site , www.wanderingearl.com			0
the reasons for not going were fairly convincing : money from the tour would support the regime and it 's repressive policies ; foreigners are used as propaganda tools by the @entity3 government by presenting tourists as people who come to pay their respects to the regime and leaders ; it would be a controlled and limited experience ; and there would be little interaction with @entity3			1
but in the end he decided to go and did n't regret his decision			0
" i still believe that the benefits of traveling to @entity3 do indeed outweigh the negatives , " he wrote on his blog			1
it 's quite possible to visit @entity3 and buy into the vision of the country that 's offered , without question			2
@entity31 was stunned by two young @entity32 women who announced at the end of their week - long tour that they were going to tell everyone back home that @entity3 was nothing like what the media portrays			1
" they were so na√Øve , " says @entity31			0
had they forgotten that there are 300,000 plus people who are going to die in concentration camps ? they are n't called @entity325 because people are executed there , they are called @entity325 because you stay there until you die			0
