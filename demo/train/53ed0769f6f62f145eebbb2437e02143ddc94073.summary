-- it 's one of the most famous sets on television right now			1
on the hit @entity5 comedy " @entity6 , " a group of scientists and their friends and neighbors go through the ups and downs of nerd life , while surrounded by memorabilia that would make any collector drool			1
" being on those sets , seeing the detail and production design -- they 're all authentic , " actor @entity16 ( @entity20 ) told @entity0 while visiting the set as the cast and crew prepared to film this thursday night 's episode			1
" everything is 100 % accurate			0
" @entity26 , who plays uber - nerd @entity27 , is not quite as informed on all manners science and comic books , but can appreciate the details			1
" i know that clouds make rain and that @entity34 dated @entity35 and after that , i kinda dry up for what else to say , " he admitted			0
" but you do n't have to understand all of it to feel the excitement of so much creativity and passion and work and the objects on our set all vibrate with that kind of energy			1
it really informs the whole pace of the room			0
" the cast , as well as fan favorite guest star @entity54 , spoke to @entity0 backstage ( which is something of a museum of nerddom all its own , with toys and comic book character posters everywhere ) about some of their favorite parts of the elaborate set , including some things viewers at home might not pick up on right away			1
( " @entity6 " is from @entity65 , which is owned by @entity0 's parent company , @entity66			1
) @entity0 : what 's it like being constantly surrounded by all of these representations of nerd culture ? @entity71 ( @entity72 ) : i 'm a scientist , so i like all that nerdy stuff			1
that was one of the things that struck me was the attention to detail			0
our set dressing and props department are really important to us , and that 's important to the producers as well			1
@entity16 : it 's amazing to still discover new stuff in @entity88 's apartment			1
@entity89 ( @entity90 ) : it 's like a theme park walking onstage			1
i 've spent a lot of time in that living room set , so i know a lot of the stuff in there -- i like how the prop department lines the hallways with all the things we 've used			1
it puts me in the mood when i 'm here at work			0
@entity105 : i feel like i 'm walking through my own house			0
i have a lot of the same action figures and comic books			0
@entity0 : what are some of your favorite pieces of the set ? @entity115 ( @entity116 ) : the " @entity118 " stuff brings me back because i was a huge " @entity118 " fan growing up as a kid			1
there 's really two camps here : " @entity122 " or " @entity118			1
" i 'm very much entrenched in the " @entity118 " camp			0
as a kid , i had dozens of " @entity118 " figurines			0
that 's how i told stories and in a way i 'm still doing that , using myself as the vessel instead of the figurine			1
@entity71 : i 'm a comic book person , i was raised in comic book stores -- when we have the comic book set , i spend my breaks in the comic book set			1
once i saw " @entity141 , " and i was trying to explain it to @entity26 and i was saying " this is a collected ' @entity141 , ' i had to collect them all individually ! " he said , " i do n't care ! ( laughs ) i play someone who cares but i do n't really care			0
" @entity144 ( @entity145 ) : i love the comic book store , that 's the best , because i 'm a huge " @entity147 " and " @entity118 " fan , and they have all these figurines from " @entity147 " and " @entity118 " and i get to be a kid again			1
@entity105 : when we work in the comic book shop set , i want to take a lot of the books home with me			1
there are some incredible @entity158 archive collections that are just used as set decoration			1
i walk in like @entity160 , " this belongs in a museum			0
" @entity144 : we 've had the sword from " @entity166 " and i love it and i want to pick it up , but i know if i destroy it , it 's going to be $ 10,000			1
it 's a heavy thing			1
@entity16 : i am a big " @entity166 " fan -- that sword is a real sword and that was cool			0
there are also some very racy figurines -- these women are really decked out			0
one is sort of a sadomasochistic fever dream			0
@entity177 ( @entity178 ) : when we 're doing stuff in @entity20 's room , there 's a lot of action figures in there			1
i was always very intrigued by how detailed the action figures are , especially the women			0
they are very , very detailed -- they 're like miniature blow - up dolls			2
@entity189 : i do have a unique relationship with ( @entity88 's spot ) on the couch			2
we do a lot of scenes in that apartment set and , as an actor , one of the first things you figure out is where you will physically start a scene on the stage and , nine times out of 10 , i start on the spot on that couch			2
it 's as close as i think i 'll ever get to @entity208 's chair			2
@entity89 : i love being in @entity90 's apartment			2
being in the kitchen , drinking wine , feels like what i do at home			0
@entity115 : i have a bit of a superstitious tradition of decorating my dressing room with things the character would have , so i took quite a lot of set dressing for my dressing room			2
in season 4 , i thought this is enough			0
i started tripping over board games			0
@entity0 : are there any little details that fans might not be aware of right away ? @entity115 : guests are always interested in the stairwell , and that it only goes down about seven steps and there 's a wall there			1
you 'd think they would have given us more room			0
we really have to pack ourselves like sardines to be out of the camera 's view -- the @entity243 magic that is never quite as glamorous as one might imagine			2
@entity89 : people always ask if we eat the food ( during scenes )			0
i must be the only one who really eats the food			0
i save my appetite until we do those scenes -- i want to look real , man ! @entity177 : @entity251 's sheets are the most comfortable sheets and the most comfortable bed			2
i love doing scenes in there -- it 's like nap time ! it 's so comfortable			2
@entity71 : one of my actual genetics textbooks is in the guys ' apartment			0
@entity144 : at the back of the guys ' apartment is a " @entity122 " communicator			0
you ca n't see it but it 's a big deal			2
it 's really cool -- if you look carefully enough you 'll see it			2
@entity105 : one of my favorite things i noticed two seasons ago , is in @entity88 and @entity116 's apartment , all the way upstage where the window looks out into @entity276 , they have action figures up there and one of them is @entity281 , who is articulated so he 's doing the @entity282 " live long and prosper " salute			1
and it 's super-rad because it will never read on television			2
i think it 's such an awesome little detail that of course one of these guys would have done that -- because i would have .			0
