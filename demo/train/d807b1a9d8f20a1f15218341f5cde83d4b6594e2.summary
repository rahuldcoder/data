a company whose video chat service apparently captured audio of @entity5 's shooting said thursday the recording was created at the time the @entity8 teenager was killed this month			1
the revelation from @entity10 appears to bolster a man 's claim that he inadvertently recorded audio of gunfire at the time a police officer shot and killed the 18 - year - old @entity5 in the @entity17 suburb of @entity18 on august 9			1
the video was created at 12:02:14 p.m. that day , @entity19 said			0
@entity5 , who was unarmed , was shot by @entity18 police officer @entity21 shortly after noon			2
" a glide user living nearby was simply using the @entity10 app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed -- to instantly communicate with a friend through our real - time video texting service			2
simultaneously , they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at @entity5 , " the company said			1
the sounds could be a piece in the larger puzzle of what happened during the shooting , which spurred days of protests in the city of 21,000			1
police have said @entity5 was trying to grab the officer 's gun			1
witnesses say the teen was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot			0
investigators are determining whether to accuse the officer of wrongdoing ; no charges have been filed			0
the @entity52 obtained the audio and interviewed the man who made the recording , said @entity56 , a lawyer for that individual			1
the man , who asked that his identity not be revealed , lives near the site of the @entity5 shooting and happened to be using the application at the same time @entity5 was shot , @entity56 said			1
in the recording , a quick series of shots can be heard , followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots			0
forensic audio expert @entity68 analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six , followed by four			0
the significance of the pause witnesses and a friend of @entity21 have given conflicting accounts of what led to @entity5 's death , and the pause could be key in the investigation			1
but it 's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports			0
@entity18 police have alleged that @entity5 robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting , and that he and a friend , @entity90 , were walking down a street when @entity21 approached them in a police car			1
police say @entity21 stopped @entity5 not because of the theft , but because @entity5 and a friend were blocking traffic			1
@entity21 tried to exit his vehicle but @entity5 pushed him back into the car , according to a preliminary investigation , @entity17 police chief @entity97 said			2
read the police reports @entity5 assaulted the officer while @entity21 was in the car , and a shot was fired inside the police car during a struggle over the officer 's gun , @entity97 said			1
@entity90 disputes that , saying @entity21 -- while sitting in the car -- started the scuffle by grabbing @entity5 by the neck , and that @entity5 tried to pull away			2
@entity90 also said that there was no struggle for the gun , but rather that @entity21 drew the weapon and shot @entity5 once at the car			2
@entity90 said @entity21 shot @entity5 again as the teen ran away			2
according to @entity90 , @entity5 was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting			1
but a woman who identified herself as a friend of @entity21 called in to a @entity17 radio show with what she said was the officer 's version of events			0
the caller , who identified herself only as " @entity129 , " said @entity5 -- after going away from the vehicle following the first shot -- turned around , taunted the officer and charged at him			0
her account matches what @entity21 has told investigators , a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told @entity139			0
an autopsy showed @entity5 had six gunshot wounds			0
attorney @entity142 told @entity139 this week he was surprised by the gap in shots			0
" it 's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting , especially with an unarmed victim , because at this point mr. @entity5 is defenseless -- he has no weapon , " said @entity142 , who represented the family of @entity146			1
like @entity5 , @entity146 was an unarmed @entity154 - @entity153 man who was shot and killed by a white police officer			1
that incident occurred in @entity157			0
but if the gunfire heard on the audio is from the @entity5 incident , the pause does n't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer			2
" to be fair , there could be other explanations for that pause , " said attorney @entity164 , co-host of @entity139 's " @entity165			0
" " maybe the officer will say , ' well , i fired and he kept advancing , so i fired again			0
