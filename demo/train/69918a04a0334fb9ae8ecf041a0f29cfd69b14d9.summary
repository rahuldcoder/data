@entity0 , @entity1 -- be prepared , the next big thing facing a green makeover might just be your closet			1
the glitzy world of fashion and design does n't typically conjure up images of sustainability and social consciousness , but if its up to @entity13 , ceo of the @entity14 and chairman of the @entity16 , that 's all going to change			1
in the last month , she has pulled off the largest sustainable fashion summit in the world , and starting this week , she is launching a global social media campaign , aiming to forever change the way we look at our clothes			1
her goal is for all companies in the industry to declare sustainability a key value			2
" i have worked in the fashion industry for nearly 20 years , and it is a wonderful and exciting industry , but it is also one of the largest and most polluting in the world , " said @entity13			1
from the massive consumption of water and fertilizer in cotton production , to the chemical processing at plants , the pollution of local waterways and environments , safety issues for workers , fair wages , child labor and other social concerns -- issues for the fashion industry are enormous , she says			1
" that is why it is so important that we address this ... and because of the size of the industry , even a small change can make a big difference , " says @entity13			1
@entity13 , who founded the @entity14 as the only employee in 2005 , is credited by industry professionals and government ministers for having put @entity1 design and sustainable fashion on the world map			1
last month , she gathered more than 1,000 people -- including @entity62 celebrities , international designers and other industry professionals -- at the @entity65 , to explore sustainable solutions			1
the culmination was a suggested @entity68 for the @entity70 and textile industry , created in conjunction with the @entity72 , and to be presented alongside the @entity73 @entity73 in @entity74 in june			1
" it aims to drill into the supply chain , " says @entity75 , head of partnerships and local networks at @entity78 , " and if the sector responds , it will have a tremendous impact			0
" " there is a movement underway , " says @entity13			2
" it is happening , and we can help shed light on it			0
" that is also the goal of her latest venture launching this week -- an online campaign called @entity93 , or the @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			1
it aims to have the industry join forces around change , and to educate consumers to make conscious choices			2
" the entire field is so heavily knowledge based that it makes it difficult for companies to get started			0
the key is to make ... knowledge accessible and to create networks , because there are solutions			0
" she says new and sustainable fashions are already being made from innovative textiles such as milk fibers , corn , and bamboo			1
among those leading the charge are companies like @entity123 chain store @entity122 with their conscious collection , @entity125 , @entity1 design house @entity126 , and the @entity127 with brands like @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			1
@entity122 's head of sustainability , @entity133 says this is the future			2
" customers are becoming more and more aware and want transparency , which makes companies improve their sustainability performance and make more sustainable products			2
" and , she says , " as a big player we can help drive demand			0
" at @entity126 , which boasts a massive list of celebrity clients like @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and many others -- ethical fashion and the way they reuse , redesign , respin , and recycle leftover fabric from their own collection and that of other design houses is part of the design			0
" as pioneers we feel we have helped set the agenda on an issue that is about much more than just fashion , " says managing director , @entity166			0
" this way , fashion suddenly gets new meaning , becoming a statement , a value , an act			0
" @entity13 agrees , saying it has the potential to push other industries with it , by making it look smart to consider your choices			2
" if all the big brands and strong designers care -- and show and tell that they care -- then people could also begin to think differently about how they spend their money			0
her goal : " to have people join forces to help us change the world			0
" and to her , that change starts in our closets			0
but do n't worry , she says , " the aim is n't for all of us to start wearing brown			0
sustainable fashion can be equally sexy , desirable and fantastic in every way			2
the aim is to create the brilliance with less impact on people and our planet			0
