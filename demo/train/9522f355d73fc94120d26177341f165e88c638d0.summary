-- the steep , picturesque canyons that wind through @entity3 's northern @entity2 have been a draw for tourists , day - trippers and homebuyers for more than a century			1
but when record - setting rainfall began to hit last week , those picturesque canyons became funnels that poured hundreds of tons of water per second into towns like @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 and left hundreds stranded in the mountains above			1
" this flood was a direct result of the large amount of rainfall that occurred in a widespread area , essentially from @entity20 north to almost the @entity27 state line , and for a long duration -- for about a 48 - hour period last week , " said @entity18 , a hydrologist with the @entity19 in @entity20			2
@entity29 are still digging out from those floods , which have been up to 1,000 - year events in some communities			0
a stream of unusually humid air that was sweeping over the area early last week helped fuel the storms			0
high pressure east of the mountains bumped up against a low - pressure system to the west , triggering several days of storms as moist air flowed up the peaks of the @entity44 , where cold air wrung the water out of it			0
the rain began september 10 , with an inch recorded in @entity13			1
nearly two inches fell the next day			2
then on september 12 , @entity13 recorded 9.08 inches of rain -- nearly double the city 's previous one - day record , and almost half its 20.5 - inch yearly average			1
a forecaster in the @entity55 office there called it " biblical			0
" more than 4 more inches of rain fell by the week 's end , bringing the september total to more than 17 inches so far			2
that 's boosted the yearly precipitation figure , measured from october through september , to more than 30 inches to date -- the most in 120 years of record - keeping			0
the biggest rainfall amounts occurred over the foothills of the @entity44 , @entity18 said			2
that water poured down the mountainsides into the major tributaries of the @entity69 -- @entity70 and the @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 rivers			1
how to help " it really originated in the streams that drain off the east side of the @entity78 into the front range of @entity3 , but it all happened fairly quickly , " @entity18 said			1
" even though the leading edge was in the foothills , we did see it very quickly on the 12th in communities like @entity13 and @entity15 and @entity14			1
" the result was six dead and about 200 who remained unaccounted for , though most of those are believed to be alive and well			2
@entity90 reduced its count from 109 people to four still unaccounted for on wednesday , while in @entity93 , to the north , the number remained at 197			1
nearly 18,000 homes have been damaged statewide			0
now the runoff is coursing down the @entity69 into neighboring @entity97 , where forecasters are warning of flooding into the weekend			1
" we 're in the @entity104 area anxiously waiting to see how the @entity69 responds and to see how much of the water reaches us here , " @entity100 told @entity0 affiliate @entity101			1
many in @entity3 returned home to heartbreaking scenes			0
in @entity15 , on the @entity110 15 miles north of @entity13 , high water pushed entire houses around like furniture			1
streets were dotted with snapped utility poles			0
stories of grief , generosity and gratitude the extensive damage may present long - term problems for communities even as workers scramble to make repairs , @entity93 sheriff @entity119 said tuesday			0
questions of how to provide emergency services to areas where roads have been washed out or protect properties where the owners have been evacuated are still being worked out , he said			0
" we have a new normal in @entity93 for months , if not a few years , " @entity119 said			0
@entity0 's @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 contributed to this report .			0

@entity90 says only 4 still unaccounted for
@entity13 saw nearly half its annual rainfall in a single day
" it all happened fairly quickly , " a *scientist* says
@entity97 warily watches the rising @entity69
