-- when the first book of the " @entity4 " series was released in october 2005 , no one could have guessed the phenomenon it would become			1
four years later , 70 million copies have been sold worldwide			0
the books have spent 143 weeks on the @entity10 best - seller list , and the first movie in " @entity12 " grossed $ 380 million at the box office			0
the story , a love triangle between a vampire , a human and a werewolf , has ignited an international frenzy , and the woman behind it all is 35 - year - old author @entity22			1
once a stay - at - home mom , @entity22 says the idea for " @entity4 " came to her in a dream			1
" it was two people in kind of a little circular meadow with really bright sunlight , and one of them was a beautiful , sparkly boy and one was just a girl who was human and normal , and they were having this conversation			2
the boy was a vampire , which is so bizarre that i 'd be dreaming about vampires , and he was trying to explain to her how much he cared about her and yet at the same time how much he wanted to kill her , " @entity22 says			1
" it really captured my imagination			0
" that dream became chapter 13 of " @entity4			1
" @entity0 : get your twilight " primer before the night of the dream , @entity22 says she had lost herself a little in the work of motherhood			1
" i was really burned out			0
i really had gotten into that zombie mom way of doing things where i was n't @entity22 anymore , " she says			1
" [ @entity4 ] was a release			1
that was the dam bursting			0
i 'd been bottling up who i was for so long , i needed an expression			2
" though she 'd been married for 15 years , @entity22 says she did n't tell her husband at first about her new passion			1
" my husband thought i 'd gone crazy			2
i 'd barely spoken to him because i had all these things going on in my head , and i was n't telling him about this weird vampire obsession because i knew he 'd freak out and think i 'd lost my mind , " she says			1
at first , @entity22 was documenting her dream only to make sure she would remember it , she says			1
" the dream was just something i was so interested in , and it was so different from what my everyday was at the time , " she says			2
" i just wanted to remember it so badly			0
that 's why i started writing it down -- not because i thought this would be a great story for a novel			0
" @entity0 : read an excerpt from " @entity4 " though @entity22 had been an avid reader all her life , she says she was never a writer before " @entity4			1
" " it seems kind of presumptuous to me [ to think ] anyone else would want to read the things that are in my head , " she says			1
" i did n't think of it [ as a book ]			2
and then i wanted to see what would happen with them			0
it was just me spending time with this fantasy world , and then when it was finished it was like , ' this is long enough to be a book ! ' " before " @entity4 , " @entity22 says she read every type of book except for horror			1
" that was the genre i just knew i was too chicken for , " she says			0
" i read a little bit of everything			2
... when i was 8 , i was reading " @entity101 " and " @entity102 " and all that , not knowing it was n't my reading level			2
" @entity0 : gift ideas for every reader on your list now that " @entity4 " is a huge success , it 's hard to imagine any literary agent rejecting it			1
but @entity22 says she 'd submitted it to plenty of people before she was signed			1
" i got nine rejections , five no answers and then one ' i 'd like to read more , ' " she says			1
@entity22 says it was her sister who really pushed her to keep submitting it to more agents			1
" she was the only one in the world who knew what i was doing , " she says			0
these days , the " @entity4 " series is more than just a literary hit			1
the first two movies have also created a stir and catapulted three young stars into the limelight			0
@entity134 actor @entity133 , who plays the lead vampire @entity136 , is now an international heartthrob			0
" i knew that the problem was going to be @entity136 , because he 's the perfect vampire , " @entity22 says			1
" how do you cast that from your pool of human actors ? " when producers found @entity133 , @entity22 says it was a perfect fit			2
" he 's got something about him			0
he does n't look like everybody else			0
there 's something unusual , " she says			0
" there are moments where he looks exactly like he did in my head			0
" @entity22 says casting @entity153 , the book 's protagonist , was a bit easier			1
" there 's plenty of people who look like the girl next door , " she says			2
" we were really lucky [ to cast ] @entity161 , who is a phenomenal actress			0
i did n't know if we were going to get that caliber			0
" though twi - hards , as fans are called , know most everything about the series , @entity22 says there is one secret she 's never revealed before			2
" there was a different ending to " @entity171 " originally , " she says			2
" it was a much quieter book			0
it was very much all in @entity153 's head			0
" @entity0 : are you a @entity176 - hard ? take the quiz ! @entity22 says fans have her mother to thank for " @entity171 's " current dramatic ending			1
" my mom 's like : ' you know , @entity22 , maybe a little more action at the end would be a good idea			1
maybe you need that , ' " @entity22 says			2
" and she was right , as usual			0
" find out more about " @entity171 " her mother 's suggestion prompted @entity22 to introduce the @entity190 , an all - powerful coven of vampires living in @entity193 , sooner than she 'd planned			1
" that 's kind of my favorite part now , and it 's there because my mom told me it would be better that way			0
