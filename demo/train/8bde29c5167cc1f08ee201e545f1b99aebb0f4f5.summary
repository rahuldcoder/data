-- according to the conventional wisdom , lame duck presidents ca n't do very much			1
the popular image is that they are killing time , maybe grabbing a beer with the locals , until the new guy or gal comes to town			1
there are many reasons why the lame duck period is so daunting			1
presidents ca n't scare their opponents with the threat of what they will do in or after the next election , while opponents are prepared to double down in their obstruction to destroy the legacy of the @entity21 and prevent a departing president from making gains that will benefit his party			1
for voters , gone is the thrill of the original election			0
now they are well aware of all the president 's flaws and failures			2
at the same time , members of the president 's party in @entity35 are reluctant to take any more big risks for their leader given that he will soon be goneâ € ” and hopefully they will not			2
but the truth is that a lot can happen in the final years of a presidency			0
the notion that this is dead political time does n't hold water			2
while all the obstacles facing presidents in the lame duck period are very real , there are a number of factors that can allow a president to make significant progress at this key moment			1
a crisis is the most important factor			0
stuff happens in politics , and sometimes a crisis creates a window of opportunity for presidential action even when @entity35 has been gridlocked for long periods			0
when major crises occurâ € ” whether economic , humanitarian , natural or national security -- presidents can find that public pressure is so great for government action they can twist and turn @entity35 into action			1
this has happened many times			0
most recently , president @entity69 was able to implement the surge in @entity71 when his policies in 2007 seemed to be failing			2
even though the public had turned against him and @entity35 came under @entity76 control in 2006 , the @entity71 civil war created room for action			0
when the bottom fell out of financial markets in fall 2008 , @entity69 was also able to push through the @entity82 program that bailed out the banks and restored some stability to financial markets			0
on the surface president @entity86 faces a crisis in the @entity89 and @entity90 that will further drag him down			1
this weekend he reached out to @entity92 prime minister @entity91 to try to encourage efforts for peace in the @entity89			1
many people are skeptical that the president will have much luck achieving any kind of breakthrough			1
but if secretary of state @entity101 can manage to broker a cease - fire , combined with some broader accord that stabilizes the situation in the @entity89 , this could be considered one of the president 's greatest triumphs			1
and if @entity86 can bring international pressure to bear on @entity109 and its allied rebels to a point that president @entity112 backs off from his aggressive path , this too could prove to be a credit to the president 's record			1
on domestic policy the multiple court decisions that continue to raise questions about the @entity119 could create an opportunity for president @entity86 to go back to @entity35 to fix and strengthen the legislation			1
international diplomatic pressure is a force that can operate outside the normal political cycle			0
sometimes actions by foreign leaders can emerge to provide huge opportunities for effective leadership			2
this was certainly the case with @entity132 , who pushed hard to complete negotiations over the @entity134 in 1987 even as president @entity135 faced intense push - back from the right			2
the result was that @entity135 regained his standing after the disastrous impact of the @entity141 and in 1987 signed an agreement that is considered one of his most important achievements			0
today , with world events so chaotic , president @entity86 would be eager and receptive to any new voice that emerges from the tumult to help achieve peace			1
midterms can also push elected officials toward agreements			0
voters can shift the political winds in @entity154			0
if @entity157 do extremely well in 2014 , as conservatives hope , the results could embolden the @entity157 and perhaps frighten @entity158 into deals on issues like border control			0
if @entity158 do better than expected , holding back the traditional losses that usually take place , they could end up causing fear among @entity157 that they need to make some deals or they will do even worse in the 2016 election			0
president @entity86 could use that kind of leverage to push through the immigration reform plan that has eluded him			1
when the @entity157 only scored meager gains in the 1998 midterm elections , which came at the height of the effort to impeach president @entity174 , @entity157 came out fearful that they had gone too far and were losing ground as the party of extremism			2
in @entity174 's final years he was able to reach some deals with the @entity35 on deficit reduction that bolstered his own standing			0
finally , part of how the lame duck period unfolds will depend on how much political risk president @entity86 is willing to take to get things done , either through executive action or the legislative process			1
it is possible that in these final years a president can lose some of the inhibitions that shaped his time in office to take a chance on bold moves that upset his own party			2
in 1968 , when president @entity197 was trying to get a 10 % tax surcharge through @entity35 that would help finance the @entity199 even while continuing the war in @entity201 , congressional conservatives insisted on steep spending cuts that were intolerable to liberals			2
after announcing in march 1968 that he would not run for re-election , @entity197 agreed to the cuts and obtained the revenue he needed			0
in 1980 , after having lost to @entity135 , @entity158 agreed to a series of compromises on legislation to protect 100 million acres of land in the @entity212 wilderness , realizing they would get a much worse deal after @entity135 was in the @entity21 , to pass a bill that became a landmark of environmental protection			0
as his second term begins to wind down , president @entity86 could , for instance , continue to move aggressively by using executive orders to achieve more progress on climate change			1
he could also return to discussion of some kind of deal on @entity226 and @entity227 that he has been talking about for years , even though it would certainly anger the base of his party			0
he could tackle some issues , like urban poverty or campaign finance reform , that he has mostly put aside since taking office			0
so watch out for the lame duck period : president @entity86 's supporters should be a little more optimistic about what can happen in the next few years ; while his opponents should n't be so confident that they will rule the roost			1
history shows that the next few years could be a highly creative and significant period in @entity86 's presidency			2
just when things seem most desperate , presidents have sometimes found the space they need in the closing months of their term to make gains			1

popular image is that lame duck presidents are *powerless* , just serving out their term
@entity255 : lame ducks actually can accomplish things , by *responding* to crises
do n't write off the chance of @entity89 breakthrough by president @entity86 , he says
@entity255 : circumstances can create powerful opportunities for change
