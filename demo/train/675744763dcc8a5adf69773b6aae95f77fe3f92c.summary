ahead of a grand jury 's decision on whether to indict a police officer in the killing of @entity5 , @entity0 has both called in the @entity6 and diminished the role of the @entity8			1
@entity0 gov. @entity9 declared a state of emergency monday as a precaution , he said , in the event of unrest or violence			1
it 's unknown when the grand jury will hand down a decision on whether to indict @entity18 police officer @entity18 for his fatal shooting of @entity5 , a teen			1
prosecutors have suggested the grand jury would be done deliberating in mid- to late november			2
at the national level , the @entity23 last week issued a bulletin to law enforcement urging vigilance in the days before the @entity18 grand jury decision , according to a law enforcement official			1
the bulletin did not cite any specific intelligence to suggest there was any ongoing threat to officers			0
it was based on what had occurred during previous protests			0
the bulletin expressed concern over possible violence relating to @entity18 protests and warning officers to be vigilant			2
in addition , it also mentioned that officers should take proper precautions and be vigilant over possible hacking of their personal information , the law enforcement official said			1
' possibility of expanded unrest ' @entity9 said he signed the executive order because of the " possibility of expanded unrest			0
" @entity9 said people have the right to protest peacefully but that citizens and businesses must be protected from violence and damage			0
@entity59 mayor @entity58 said the governor 's plan will bring @entity6 troops to @entity59 , where @entity18 is located , but he said their role is designed to be secondary to local law enforcement			1
as @entity0 prepared to deploy the troops -- officials did not say how many -- the role of the @entity8 in the case of unrest in that city will be reduced			1
it 's her @entity18 -- and it 's not all black and white in the event of unrest in @entity18 , that city 's police will not be at the forefront of a response , @entity9 said in a teleconference with reporters			1
the @entity80 will lead any response , and they will be the ones coordinating with the @entity6 , if needed			0
the governor expects the role of @entity18 officers will be to handle routine calls not related to protests or unrest			2
@entity5 , a black teen , was fatally shot by @entity18 , a white police officer , on august 9			1
the grand jury is weighing whether to indict @entity18			1
share your view from @entity18 ' that ugliness ... can not be repeated ' " in the days immediately following @entity5 's death , peaceful protests were marred by senseless acts of violence and destruction , " the governor said last week			2
" that ugliness was not representative of @entity0 , and it can not be repeated , " said @entity9			0
the state of emergency will expire in 30 days unless extended by another order			0
@entity58 said the exact positions of the @entity6 troops has not been decided , but he said the troops will " not be on the front lines , confronting protesters			0
" they will play a secondary role , he said , and will be partnered with local law enforcement anywhere they are posted			1
while @entity58 emphasized the back - up role of the @entity6 , he said he agreed with the governor 's decision to declare a state of emergency			0
the troops are needed for visibility and deterrence , @entity58 said			0
there are too many unknowns about what the grand jury decision might be and how the public may react , he said			2
@entity58 said it makes sense to be prepared in case there is violence			0
the governor said the goal is to keep citizens safe while protecting people 's right to protest			0
