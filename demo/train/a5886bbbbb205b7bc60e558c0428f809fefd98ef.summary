-- @entity1 wants you to start a revolution			1
the superstar spoke to @entity0 's @entity5 on thursday about her new project , @entity7			1
with it , she is inviting fans to submit original video , music , poetry and photography to fight oppression , intolerance and complacency through art. through @entity7 , she explains , " we have created this platform to give people around the world an opportunity to answer the question : ' what does freedom mean to you ? ' " " i 'm encouraging other people , whether they 're professionals or not , to use their creativity to express themselves , to get a conversation going , to get the party started , really , " @entity1 told @entity5			1
in september , @entity1 revealed what was then only known as # secretprojectrevolution in 10 cities , including @entity33 and @entity34			1
those in attendance were treated to a " call to action " film the singer created with photographer @entity39 , in partnership with @entity41 and @entity42			2
@entity5 caught up with a relaxed @entity1 , who joked that she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after a grueling workout			1
but the artist was clearly passionate about the subject and even asked her son @entity48 to wait a moment while the interview ran long			0
@entity5 and @entity1 had a wide - ranging conversation , touching upon her favorite quote from author @entity53 ( " i do n't separate the human spirit from the artistic spirit " ) to what ever happened to that boy scout uniform @entity1 wore to the @entity59 awards earlier this year			1
( @entity60 of her kids claimed an article of clothing , but " i kept the combat boots , " @entity1 said			1
" i 'll need those for my revolution			0
" ) here are some highlights from the interview : @entity5 : i 've heard you call this project the most important thing you 've done , besides raising your children			1
obviously , i feel a great sense of responsibility being a good parent and raising my children			1
i do n't take that job very lightly			0
who they are , what they become and what they contribute to the world is very important to me			2
no slacking in that area , thank god , but the same goes with this film			0
i 've put in i do n't know how many man hours , i 've poured my own money into it			2
@entity39 has done the same			0
we 've done it for no financial gain , ( and ) also not to promote any product in particular			2
the only reason we 're doing this is because we want to shed light on subjects that need to have light shed on ( them )			0
i do see that the world that we live in is collapsing to a certain extent , and civilization as we know it is caving in on itself			0
i believe that we are at a very low level of consciousness , and we do not know how to treat each other as human beings			0
we are caught up in our own lives , our own needs , our own ego gratification			0
i feel a strong sense of responsibility in delivering that message			0
@entity1 : get the fast facts @entity5 : it seems there is an optimism in what you 're doing			1
i 'm doing it because i believe in the ultimate good of humanity , but a lot of times push has to come to shove			0
i think you 've noticed yourself over the years that , when do people really want to come to the rescue of others ? when there 's a catastrophe			1
when 9/11 happens , or when the floods happen in @entity135 , or when the bombs happened in @entity137			0
what happens ? people come together			2
suddenly , people say , what can i do to help ? what can i do to be of service ? what i 'm trying to say is , why do we have to be pushed to the worst - case scenarios to bring out the best in ourselves to be the best version of ourselves that we can be ? @entity1 is 2013 's top - earning celebrity @entity5 : i went to the opening of " secretprojectrevolution " in @entity34 and you incorporated some words from @entity53			1
i 'm not quoting directly , but he said , only the artist can truly see and describe the human condition			0
i do n't think that 's something a lot of people really think about , but that 's something clearly you believe in very strongly -- that art can actually make a change in people 's lives			1
@entity1 : i believe that			1
and i think that it used to make a much bigger change in people 's lives in the days when people were not censored			1
in the days when branding was n't in charge			0
now , in order for people to get their stuff out there , they have to be associated with a brand and once you start associating with a brand , unfortunately , the brand starts to censor you			2
and then suddenly it 's not your pure vision anymore			2
imagine if someone like @entity185 or @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , whomever , were doing their work and some corporation , some ceo , some branding entity was saying to you , well you can do that , but you 've got to remove this aspect of your work			2
there would no longer be that purity anymore			0
we would n't have their gift			0
we would n't learn from what they had to share with us			0
i 'm all for noncensorship and freedom of expression			0
