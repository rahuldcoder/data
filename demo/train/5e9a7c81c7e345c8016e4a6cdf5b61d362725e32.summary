-- i recall being an undergraduate in @entity4 studies at @entity5 when the @entity6 invaded @entity7 in december 1979			0
i was flabbergasted when then - president @entity8 initially expressed surprise that @entity10 and his cronies decided to undertake that ill - fated adventure			0
just the little i knew of @entity6 history at that time led me to conclude that one should never be @entity15 about @entity16			2
wisely , the @entity8 administration soon implemented a wide - ranging and powerful set of sanctions against the @entity6			0
by comparison , @entity20 is now making @entity8 look like @entity22 with a series of empty threats and " too little , too late " punitive measures against @entity26			1
on february 28 , president @entity20 warned @entity16 not to take military action against @entity28 , and if he did so , serious " costs " would be imposed			1
a few weeks later , @entity28 was annexed to @entity16 and virtually no serious " costs " have been incurred from @entity31 sanctions			1
now @entity20 and our @entity33 allies have virtually conceded @entity28 , but again warn @entity35 that we really mean it this time , that if you take military action in @entity38 outside @entity28 , you will be really sorry ! i think the only thing that has surprised @entity35 is how weak @entity20 's response has been			1
the administration was not prepared for the contingency that @entity35 would act so brazenly			2
but @entity20 's stubborn insistence on a measured , incremental approach seems premised on his belief that @entity35 will , after his frustration and anger clears , come to his senses and seize the proverbial " off ramp " @entity20 and his officials ritualistically refer to , hearkening back to nearly two years of the mantra , " @entity52 must go			1
" we know that @entity52 never left , and i see no evidence that @entity35 wants to take the " off - ramp			2
" surely @entity35 's goals were not limited to getting @entity28 while losing @entity38			1
that does not make sense			0
and since he has met virtually no push back for @entity28 , why would he stop there ? it is not like his views on @entity38 are not fairly well known			1
at the @entity64 @entity63 summit in april 2008 , @entity35 told @entity65 in no uncertain terms that @entity38 was not a real country			1
and now @entity35 has found the appropriate moment to demonstrate to the " trans - @entity70 community " that @entity38 is not a real country by starting to dismember it with impunity			1
in case there was any doubt about @entity35 's views of the illegitimacy of the @entity84 @entity33 security order in @entity33 , his vitriolic speech to the @entity76 in @entity77 on march 18 should clarify it for skeptics			2
i have no doubt that there is nothing @entity35 would rather do than delegitimize the @entity84 order , expose the @entity70 partnership as a sham and deeply degrade @entity31 leadership in the world			2
he has already gone fairly far down that path in four weeks			0
why do @entity31 presidents have such a hard time understanding @entity4 leaders ? first , it starts with our inability to fathom just how traumatic the collapse of the @entity6 was for several generations of @entity4			0
from a clinical standpoint , @entity16 has been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder for the past couple of decades			2
@entity35 resonates with many @entity4 because he is seen as the embodiment of the humiliation , status deprivation and grievances that the country has purportedly suffered			0
making matters worse , he was an intelligence operative virtually abandoned by what he and his brethren view as incompetent @entity6 leadership			0
the ethos of the @entity4 intelligence officer going back to the foundation of the secret police in the early 19th century centers on their special , almost messianic obligation to save @entity16 from itself -- a task only they were adequately trained for			2
these were people who , for example , enthusiastically supported the @entity31 initiative more than 20 years ago to remove nuclear weapons from @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity38 , not because they gave a damn about nonproliferation but because when the day came for @entity16 to restore the " @entity16 , " that task would be much easier with nukes out of the way			1
in the 1990s , many speculated about the danger of a " @entity140 " scenario in which the humiliated superpower would re-emerge in more of a fascist form			0
i am afraid that day has arrived			0
@entity35 's task is to take back what a certain streak of @entity4 nationalism views as not only rightfully , but sacredly , what should be @entity4			1
@entity20 may satisfy some supporters and even some critics by taunting @entity35 and @entity16 as a " regional power " of no great consequence acting out of " weakness			1
" this will only bait the bear to lash out to demonstrate who is really weak and who is strong			0
it is a game that @entity20 is not psychologically equipped to understand , let alone win			0
a @entity4 strike , either after a manufactured provocation or without one , into eastern @entity38 , is inevitable			0
@entity35 smells blood in the water , and nothing we have said or done will deter him			0
economic measures alone are insufficient			0
if @entity20 does not rise to this challenge soon , i fear that @entity35 will happily ruin his legacy and @entity31 credibility , with massive collateral damage for @entity4 and @entity38			1
@entity35 will likely meet his own end if he miscalculates in @entity38			2
it is incumbent for the @entity31 , its allies and most importantly @entity38 themselves , to help @entity35 not miscalculate because if he does , there will be hell to pay for all of us .			1

@entity178 : @entity20 and allies have issued empty threats at @entity35
@entity178 : despite @entity16 's annexation of @entity28 , @entity20 's responses are weak
he says since @entity35 has met no push back for @entity28 , why would he stop there ?
@entity178 : @entity35 may ruin @entity20 's legacy by further *encroaching* @entity38
