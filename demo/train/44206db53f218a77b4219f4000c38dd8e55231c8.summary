whether it 's @entity1 becoming the most popular baby name , or one in 10 babies in @entity4 being @entity5 or the fact that halal meat is being served in @entity9 , a @entity5 story always tends to generate more heat than light			0
indeed , @entity13 is often perpetuated by fear and a sense that @entity16 are taking over our jobs , our homes and our lives , thus leading to a polarizing society and the so - called clash of civilizations			1
and it 's common to see issues such as the name of @entity1 being used by the far - right into vitriolic hate against @entity16			2
take for example the @entity30 headline in january 2014 : " one in 10 babies in @entity4 is a muslim : those practising the religion ' could soon outnumber actively worshipping @entity35			0
' " the article , which was accompanied by an image of two @entity5 women wearing the face veil , showed this pervading sense of online anti-muslim hate emerge with comments such as : " @entity43 , ban the burka now before its too late ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " and " this has to stop this is a @entity47 country the next thing sharia law			0
" improving media practices and media responsibility on portraying and reporting fairly on @entity51 and @entity16 , without bias or discrimination or intent to incite @entity56 prejudice , is important			1
the media must provide a more responsible , objective and proportionate way of reporting on stories			1
unfortunately , though , the stories above are not isolated			0
in @entity62 last year an article entitled , " @entity65 a ding - dong , " again provided a sensationalized and biased viewpoint that seeks to undermine all @entity16 and portray @entity51 in a negative light			2
as a result , we are seeing @entity70 muslims as a group suffer as a result of bad journalism that fuels extremist and far - right fringe groups such as @entity76 and @entity16 for @entity77			2
sadly , stories such as these help to create an atmosphere that has demonized @entity16 and fueled an @entity56 narrative			1
indeed , such reporting and representation of @entity70 muslims also helps create the framework for the " othering " of communities and in particular may influence people 's perceptions of @entity16 , especially when combined with lazy journalism that fails to correctly represent the true facts of each case			1
let 's not forget , for example , the story from 2010 , when windows were being covered up at a central @entity4 leisure center			0
the @entity30 headlined its story : " swimmers plunged into dark after council covers swimming pool windows ' to protect @entity5 women 's modesty			0
" the council revealed later though that the requests to black out the windows had not come solely from the @entity5 community			0
and we also know from previous studies looking at media coverage about @entity16 , in particular post 9/11 , that the weight of news stories -- even if individually factually accurate -- often stereotypes @entity16 in an overwhelmingly negative light			1
for example , a study conducted by academics at @entity117 found that the majority of news coverage post- 9/11 about @entity16 was negative			0
their research into media coverage of @entity70 @entity16 found that at least two - thirds of newspaper articles were focused around stories on terrorism			2
these stories often used the words such as " militancy " and " radicalism " to depict @entity16 in an overtly negative fashion and were a product of a wider @entity56 prejudice which they found across @entity70 newspapers			1
interestingly , they also found that common adjectives used to describe @entity16 included the words " ' radical , " " fanatical " and " fundamentalist			0
" so whether it 's getting stories factually incorrect or describing @entity16 as a security threat , there is clearly a backlash against @entity16 online and offline with threatening comments that are both extremely inflammatory and promote @entity13			1
this negativity is framed within the construct that @entity16 are dangerous people , and creates a " them vs. us " mentality that can be highly damaging for community relations			1
now is the time for action to reverse this trend , and as @entity152 suggests , " sanctions for dishonest and demonizing press coverage of @entity16 " might be one way to ensure that we start to see a balanced coverage that does not demonize or stereotype @entity16 .			0

@entity13 is often perpetuated by fear , sense that @entity16 are taking over our jobs , says @entity164
