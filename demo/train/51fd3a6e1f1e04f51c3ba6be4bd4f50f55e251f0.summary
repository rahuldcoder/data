@entity1 , @entity0 -- it has taken nearly two decades and $ 8.6 billion , but @entity6 's @entity5 finally opened for business thursday morning			1
a general view of the new @entity5 at @entity6 prior to its official opening on thursday			1
when @entity12 touched down from @entity13 at 4:42 a.m. ( 12:42 a.m. et ) , passengers made their way to the 400 - meter - long terminal , the largest freestanding building in @entity17			1
with 60 aircraft stands actually attached to two new buildings , " @entity24 " can handle dozens of planes at the same time -- including the new @entity22 superjumbo -- and can process 12,000 bags an hour			0
all of this is for just one occupant : @entity12			1
it 's a new era for @entity12 and the 30 million passengers who will pass through @entity24 each year			1
both have suffered for years at the four older terminals of what 's been derided as " @entity32			1
" " i 've been very critical of the airport , " @entity12 chief executive @entity33 told @entity2			1
" ( it 's ) because of the problems we have faced as a result of poor infrastructure at the airport			2
" so we now have the infrastructure			0
we have a state of the art baggage system ; we 've got a state of the art terminal building			2
we 've got lounges like you have never seen before and it will be down to us and it will be down to the people at @entity12 to make it a success			1
" part of this strategy is to get passengers to the airport earlier to avoid delays			0
travelers will be encouraged to check in online , and there will only be 54 of the classic check - in desks compared to 96 self - check - in kiosks			0
no passengers will be allowed through if they arrive less than 35 minutes before their flight			0
for those having to wait in the terminal , airport operator @entity62 built @entity24 with 112 shops and restaurants , including @entity17 chef @entity68 's first airport eatery			0
critics say @entity24 is just a massive shopping mall , but the architect says it 's a throwback to old - fashioned travel			0
" we wanted to make the experience of being in an airport exciting			0
we wanted to capture the spirit of travel , " architect @entity76 told @entity2			0
" the greatest stations , whether it is @entity79 or @entity6 , the 19th century stations did exactly that			2
" @entity12 rival @entity82 calls it a gift for @entity12			2
@entity6 expansion protesters say it 's just the latest step in a fierce battle to enlarge the world 's busiest international airport			1
@entity6 sits to the west of @entity6 in a densely populated area			2
there are already plans for a sixth terminal and a third runway			0
supporters say expansion is vital for @entity6 's economy , but environmentalists say expanding @entity6 's three main airports -- @entity6 , @entity102 , and @entity103 -- will only add to harmful climate change			1
more expansion may be years away , but @entity24 will affect most travelers using @entity6			1
many of the other airlines will be shuffled around the other four terminals over the coming months , and next year @entity110 is expected to undergo major renovation			0
" @entity32 " may not be an outdated criticism just yet			0

the new building took more than *15* years to complete following protests
building will carry all @entity12 *traffic*
