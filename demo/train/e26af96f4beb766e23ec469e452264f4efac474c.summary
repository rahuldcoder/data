in a closely watched ruling among those who criticize the captivity of marine mammals , the @entity0 on friday denied @entity6 's appeal of safety citations issued by the @entity9 @entity8 after the death of a trainer			1
a 12,000 - pound killer whale named @entity13 four years ago dragged veteran trainer @entity14 into the water and killed her in front of a horrified audience at @entity6 's flagship park in @entity19			1
after her death , @entity8 cited @entity6 and restricted how humans interact with killer whales during performances			1
those restrictions include a mandate that humans stay out of the water with killer whales unless there are physical barriers to reduce the risk of injury or death			0
@entity6 appealed but the judges , in a 2 - 1 decision , agreed with @entity8 's measures			1
" the administrative record establishes that @entity6 did not lack fair notice because the hazard arising from trainers ' close contact with killer whales in performance is preventable , " judges wrote			2
one judge dissented , saying @entity8 is overstepping its bounds and has no more of a right to impose restrictions on a specialized industry like @entity6 than it does to regulate tackling in the @entity49			2
@entity6 said it was disappointed by the decision and has not yet determined whether it will appeal to the @entity9 @entity51			0
" following the tragic death of @entity14 in 2010 , we voluntarily deployed several new safety measures , including removing trainers from the water during shows			0
in so noting in its opinion , the court acknowledged that there will still be human interactions and performances with killer whales and , according to the court , the decision simply requires that we continue with increased safety measures during our shows , " it said			0
the @entity68 , which includes @entity8 , said it was pleased by the judges ' findings			0
" the @entity0 found that @entity6 knew about the hazards associated with killer whale performances , and that the company did not adequately address those hazards , " the agency said			1
