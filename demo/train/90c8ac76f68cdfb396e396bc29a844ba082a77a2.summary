researchers do n't know how @entity4 spreads although all @entity4 cases have been linked to six countries on the @entity42 , limited human - to - human transmission has been seen among people in close contact with patients , including health care workers			1
although such transmission appears to be limited , health officials are concerned about @entity4 because of its virulence -- it can be fatal in up to one - third of cases , dr. @entity47 , assistant surgeon general for the @entity48 and director of the @entity50 , said friday			1

camels appear to be a link in the @entity4 chain camels may be one clue			2
in a paper published earlier this week , researchers said they had isolated the live @entity4 virus from two single - humped camels , known as dromedaries			1
and in february , scientists published a finding that nearly three - quarters of camels in @entity2 tested positive for past @entity4 exposure			1
mers was also found in a bat in @entity2 , the @entity23 says			0
" the way humans become infected from an animal and / or environmental source is still under investigation , " the @entity6 said last month			0
it may have a seasonal pattern officials have noted a surge in @entity4 cases this spring , and a similar increase was also seen last spring , @entity47 said on friday			2
but they do n't know whether the factors that lead to @entity4 may have a seasonal pattern , or whether the virus changes to become more easily transmissible			2
there are no treatments and no vaccine as of now , doctors can treat symptoms of @entity4 , such as fever or breathing difficulties , @entity47 said			1
however , there is no vaccine and no specific medicine , such as an antiviral drug , that targets @entity4 .			1

@entity4 has shown limited human - to - human transmission
