-- president @entity1 made it very clear : the second term is all about the domestic agenda			1
if only the world would cooperate			2
@entity1 outlined his goals for the next four years , sketching above all a progressive vision of a country with less inequality and more justice			1
and , judging by his inaugural speech , he plans to put his shoulder to the wheel			1
after all , much of the first term was consumed with averting a national economic catastrophe			2
now he can get on with building a legacy , reviving that hope and change he promised back during the 2008 campaign			0
but the most subtly striking part of @entity1 's inauguration speech was how it largely ignored the rest of the globe			1
in his 20 - minute address , he dedicated perhaps one minute to foreign policy			0
@entity29 , he said , will " try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully			0
" he vowed the country " will remain the anchor of strong alliances " and it will support democracy			0
he also declared the @entity37 " must be a source of hope for the poor , the sick , the marginalized , the victims of prejudice ... " and stand for " human dignity and justice			0
" opinion : @entity1 's ringing defense of liberalism beyond that , he did not spare a single word for tens of thousands killed by dictators , as they have been in @entity49 ; nothing about the struggle for liberal democratic rights in places like @entity54 , which sets the tone for the @entity56			1
nothing about repression and thwarting of freedom of expression , the rollback of democratic rights , or the push to destroy existing democracies , statements that could have come as welcome words of encouragement for people who share @entity37 values of freedom and justice in places like @entity54 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 or @entity75			1
the president should keep in mind that millions around the world yearn to know they have the backing of the most powerful country on @entity82			1
as he surely knows , even his words make a big difference			0
and while @entity1 plans to dedicate his efforts to the domestic agenda , a number of brewing international crises are sure to steal his attention and demand his time			1
here are a few of the foreign policy issues that , like it or not , may force @entity1 to divert his focus from domestic concerns in this new term			1
opinion : @entity1 finally meets @entity98 @entity49 unraveling : the @entity99 says more than 60,000 people have already died in a civil war that the @entity102 has , to its shame , done little to keep from spinning out of control			1
@entity105 has warned that the use of chemical or biological weapons might force its hand			0
but the regime may have already used them			0
the @entity102 has failed to nurture a moderate force in the conflict			0
now @entity114 extremists are growing more powerful within the opposition			0
the chances are growing that worst - case scenarios will materialize			0
@entity105 will not be able to endlessly ignore this dangerous war			0
@entity54 and the challenge of democracy : what happens in @entity54 strongly influences the rest of the @entity56 -- and hence world peace -- which makes it all the more troubling to see liberal democratic forces lose battle after battle for political influence against @entity114 parties , and to hear blatantly anti-semitic speech coming from the mouth of @entity132 barely two years before he became president			1
@entity73 's nuclear program : @entity1 took office promising a new , more conciliatory effort to persuade @entity73 to drop its nuclear enrichment program			1
four years later , he has succeeded in implementing international sanctions , but @entity73 has continued enriching uranium , leading @entity99 inspectors to find " credible evidence " that @entity141 is working on nuclear weapons			0
sooner or later the moment of truth will arrive			0
if a deal is not reached , @entity1 will have to decide if he wants to be the president on whose watch a nuclear weapons race was unleashed in the most dangerous and unstable part of the world			1
@entity152 terrorism : a much - neglected region of the world is becoming increasingly difficult to disregard			2
in recent days , @entity114 extremists took @entity37 and other hostages in @entity158 and @entity159 sent its military to fight advancing @entity114 extremists in @entity75 , a country that once represented optimism for democratic rule in @entity152 , now overtaken by militants who are potentially turning it into a staging ground for international terrorism			0
@entity74 repression : as @entity74 president @entity171 succeeds in crushing opposition to his increasingly authoritarian rule , he and his allies are making anti-american words and policies their favorite theme			1
a recent ban on adoption of @entity74 orphans by @entity37 parents is only the most vile example			1
but @entity105 needs @entity74 cooperation to achieve its goals at the @entity99 regarding @entity73 , @entity49 and other matters			1
it is a complicated problem with which @entity1 will have to wrestle			2
a tale of two terms : unfinished business and battles ahead then there are the long - standing challenges that could take a turn for the worse , such as the @entity195 - @entity194 conflict			0
@entity1 may not want to wade into that morass again , but events may force his hand			2
and there are the so - called " black swans , " events of low probability and high impact			0
there is talk that @entity72 and @entity206 could go to war over a cluster of disputed islands			0
a war between two of the world 's largest economies could prove devastating to the global economy , just as a sudden and dramatic reversal in the fragile @entity217 economy could spell disaster			2
@entity206 's is only the hottest of many territorial disputes between @entity72 and its @entity221 neighbors			1
then there 's @entity223 with its nuclear weapons			2
we could see regions that have garnered little attention come back to the forefront , such as @entity29 , where conflict could arise in a @entity230			2
four priorities for the next four years the president -- and the country -- could also benefit from unexpectedly positive outcomes			2
imagine a happy turn of events in @entity73 , a breakthrough between @entity195 and @entity194 , the return of prosperity in @entity240 , a successful push by liberal democratic forces in the @entity244 uprising countries , which could create new opportunities , lowering risks around the world , easing trade , restoring confidence and improving the chances for the very agenda @entity1 described in his inaugural speech			1
the aspirations he expressed for @entity29 are the ones he should express for our tumultuous planet			0
perhaps in his next big speech , the @entity260 , he can remember @entity29 's leadership position and devote more attention to those around the world who see it as a source of inspiration and encouragement			1
@entity1 's second - term priorities after all , in this second term @entity1 will not be able to devote as small a portion of his attention to foreign policy as he did during his inaugural speech			1
international disengagement is not an option			0
as others before @entity1 have discovered , history has a habit of toying with the best laid , most well - intentioned plans of @entity37 presidents			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity285 .			0

president @entity1 devoted nearly all his inaugural speech to domestic issues
@entity290 says there are world crises that will command @entity1 's attention
she says turmoil in @entity56 , repression in @entity74 , tension in @entity221 are *urgent* issues
