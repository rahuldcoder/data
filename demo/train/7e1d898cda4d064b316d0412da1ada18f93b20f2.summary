@entity0 -- whether a political ploy or bona fide proposal , a leaked version of president @entity6 's draft immigration plan raised @entity8 hackles while bringing some additional focus to the debate			1
the draft plan reported over the weekend by @entity12 and confirmed to @entity1 by an administration official included a possible path to coveted permanent residency in eight years for most of the nation 's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants			1
it also called for steps to strengthen border security and the @entity22 system to check the immigration status of workers			2
@entity8 critics pounced , with some objecting to any form of what they label " amnesty " for those in the country illegally			0
others accused @entity6 and the @entity33 of dirty tricks by going public with their draft as a bipartisan group of senators works on a possible agreement			1
conservative sen. @entity40 of @entity41 complained on monday that both the @entity6 draft and the talks involving the @entity45 's so - called @entity44 seek to " confer legal status and work authorization on @entity48 in exchange for promises of future enforcement on which this administration will never deliver			1
" " perhaps this leak , and what it reveals , may mark the beginning of the collapse of this new scheme to force through a fatally flawed plan , " @entity40 said in a statement			2
others accused @entity6 of deliberately floating an unacceptable plan so that @entity8 would reject it , bringing the party further disfavor from @entity65 , the nation 's fastest - growing demographic			1
" does the president want a result , or does he want another cudgel to beat up republicans so that he can get political advantage in the next election ? " veteran @entity8 sen. @entity74 of @entity75 said sunday on @entity77 's " @entity76			2
" to former rep. @entity83 , a @entity84 @entity8 , " a little bit of this is show from everyone , including the president 's side			2
" regardless of how it happened , the leak of @entity6 's plan " plays into the fears " of @entity8 that the president prefers keeping the issue alive for political advantage , @entity86 told @entity1 on monday			1
his wife -- former @entity93 rep. @entity93 of @entity94 -- agreed that the leak added to what she called an already deep trust deficit in @entity0			0
" the @entity99 people would be astonished if they knew how little trust existed between the two parties when we have to work together like this , " @entity93 said on @entity1			0
she acknowledged tossing the president 's plan into the debate was " a good way to move a bill			2
" " you know , come out farther to the left , make the room on the right , " @entity93 said			0
" but in this case , start with that trust			0
" administration officials insisted @entity6 wanted @entity116 to work out an agreement that can win support from both parties			1
" we will be prepared with our own plans if these ongoing talks between @entity8 and @entity125 up on @entity126 break down , " @entity6 's new chief of staff , @entity120 , said sunday on @entity122 's " @entity121			1
" " there 's no evidence that they have broken down yet			2
we are continuing to support that			0
" he added that he hoped the two sides " do n't get involved in some kind of typical @entity0 back - and - forth sideshow here and rather just ... roll up their sleeves and get to work " on writing a comprehensive immigration bill			0
along with the @entity45 talks on possible legislation , @entity33 members from both parties also are involved in their own discussions			1
the draft plan reported by @entity12 calls for an eight - year path to permanent residency for undocumented immigrants , who would face a criminal background check and have to pay back taxes , learn @entity150 and get a new " lawful prospective immigrant " visa			2
on the day after last week 's @entity155 address , in which @entity6 called for comprehensive immigration reform , he met with the four @entity125 senators involved in the @entity44 talks to reiterate what he considers to be the main principles for a final agreement			1
according to the @entity33 , those principles include " continuing to strengthen border security , creating an earned path to citizenship , holding employers accountable and streamlining legal immigration			2
" republicans stung by the overwhelming support for @entity6 from @entity65 voters that helped the president win re-election in november are divided over how to proceed on immigration			1
conservatives generally oppose any breaks for those who came to @entity99 illegally although some , like sen. @entity177 of @entity84 , contend the party must adopt a modern approach to an issue with such strong economic and social impacts			0
@entity177 , who gave the @entity8 response to @entity6 's @entity155 address , displayed the party 's conflicted posture on the issue that night			1
he did n't mention his past support of a route to legal status for undocumented immigrants now in the @entity99 , but advocated a non-specific " responsible , permanent solution to the problem			0
" first , he said , " we must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws			0
" when news of the leaked @entity6 proposal emerged , @entity177 immediately criticized it as " disappointing to those of us working on a serious solution			1
" on the @entity125 side , some of the distrust noted by @entity93 is evident			0
remembering similar bipartisan talks on major issues , such as the @entity207 that spent months working on a health care overhaul in 2009 without every reaching an agreement , they want to make sure @entity116 gets legislation to consider			1
" i know that senator @entity177 was upset with this leak , " @entity125 sen. @entity211 of @entity212 told @entity1 on sunday			0
" i am not upset			0
we 've talked to senator @entity177 and he is fully on board with our process			0
and i am very hopeful that in march we will have a bipartisan bill			0
" @entity211 said the mechanics of politics was obvious : " if a @entity221 , the president or anyone else puts out what they want on their own , it 's going to be different than what you have ( in ) a bipartisan agreement , but the only way we 're going to get something done is with a bipartisan agreement			1
" @entity1 's @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			0
