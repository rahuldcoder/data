@entity1 , @entity0 -- treating flu - stricken children with anti-viral medication including @entity6 and @entity7 could do more harm than good , a new report has warned			1
researchers say not enough study has been done into the long - term effects of anti-virals on children			1
researchers from the @entity15 found that while the anti-virals reduced the duration of illness by up to one day and a half , they had " little or no effect " on the likelihood of the children developing complications			1
the researchers conceded that they did n't know the extent to which their report applied to the current swine flu pandemic , but said , " based on current evidence , the effects of anti-virals on reducing the course of illness or preventing complications might be limited			1
" in compiling their report , published in the @entity33 , the @entity15 researchers searched the world for trials of @entity6 and @entity7 on children under 12			2
they found seven in total ; four relating to flu treatment , and three to prevention			2
they say none offered a big enough study to determine whether anti-virals have any effect on the chances of children developing serious flu - related complications			1
" we 've got very little data to go on			0
these drugs have been used on tens of thousands , in fact millions of children worldwide , and we 've found only four trials of treatments involving less than two thousand children , " said the report 's author , dr @entity57 , a senior clinical scientist at the @entity59 , the @entity15			2
" we did n't find any trials of children under one			0
and none of the trials was big enough to show if there 's any effect on serious complications like pneumonia or being hospitalized , " he said			0
the report found that while anti-virals reduced the duration of flu in children , they had little or no impact on the likelihood of the child developing ear infections or any other condition that may require antibiotics			1
a review of one study into the effect of anti-virals on asthmatic children , who are considered to have a higher risk of developing complications from the flu virus , found that they did not reduce the risk of the asthma attacks			1
the report said that one in 20 children who take @entity6 suffer nausea and vomiting , as indicated in warnings from the drug 's manufacturer			0
" that obviously can be a particular problem in young children and infants where getting dehydrated is a complication of influenza , " @entity57 said			2
the three studies that focused on the use of anti-virals to prevent influenza taking hold , showed that their potential to stop the spread of flu was " fairly small			1
" " we 'd need to treat 13 children with the preventive course of one of these drugs to prevent one of them from getting flu , " @entity57 said			2
the report 's authors suggested governments were too quick to recommend anti-virals as the first defense against the spread of swine flu			0
in the @entity130 , people who suspect they have the virus are urged to phone a government helpline			0
if enough symptoms match the operator 's list , they 're given an online voucher so a " flu friend " can collect a course of @entity6			0
" we 're not criticizing the current @entity141 policy , but we hope they 'll inform perhaps a slight shift in policy in terms of use of these drugs , " @entity57 told @entity2			0
the @entity130 @entity141 said the report was right to suggest bed rest and over the counter remedies for people with mild cases of flu , but added that it was potentially dangerous to deter people with severe cases of flu from taking @entity6 , including children			1
in a statement , a spokesman said : " whilst there is doubt about how swine flu affects children , we believe a safety - first approach of offering anti-virals to everyone remains a sensible and responsible way forward			1
however , we will keep this policy under review as we learn more about the virus and its effects			0
" the @entity173 ( @entity173 ) also adopted a cautious stance			0
the chairman of the @entity173 's general practitioner 's committee , dr @entity178 , said doctors always have to balance the risk of major complications from swine flu with the potential side - effects of anti-virals			2
" while we know they are safe , we do know that vomiting and diarrhea can occur in some children and adults who take them , " he said , adding " the more we learn about these drugs the more we will know how to treat patients with the most up - to - date clinical evidence			0

researchers examined studies into effects of anti-virals on children
found " little or no effect " when used on children suffering influenza
anti-virals were found to shorten duration of flu - like symptoms
@entity130 @entity141 said it had " a safety - first approach "
