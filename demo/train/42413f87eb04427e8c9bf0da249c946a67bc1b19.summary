-- just a few days after @entity3 decried capitalism , @entity2 lawmakers weighed a new way to honor him : putting his face on a coin			1
a proposal to create a commemorative coin as a tribute to @entity12 's first @entity3 passed in @entity2 's lower house on thursday , rep. @entity8 said in a post on his official @entity16 page			1
@entity8 first proposed the measure in april , and it garnered approval from congressional committees earlier this month			0
now the bill will be sent to the @entity23 county 's @entity21 for consideration			0
the goal of the coins , according to the text of the proposed law , is " to commemorate an event of global dimensions , so our present and future generations remember this splendid act in the history of humanity , in which the principal actor is an @entity2			2
" beneath the @entity3 's face , the coins would read , " tribute from the @entity2 people to @entity3			1
" catholic faithful across @entity12 cheered the election of @entity3 earlier this year			1
even though about 480 million of the world 's 1.2 billion @entity45 live in the region , for centuries , the church 's top job had gone to @entity49			0
that changed with the announcement that then - @entity2 cardinal @entity3 , who served as archbishop of @entity53 , would become the new pontiff			1

several years before , @entity62 's government had sparred with @entity3 in a notorious war of words over a gay marriage law the president backed			2
but since his election in march , @entity3 has made headlines by decrying the iniquities of modern capitalism , embracing the poor and people with disabilities and reaching out to gays and lesbians			0
at the same time , the 77 - year - old pontiff has sought to to awaken a spirit of joy and compassion in the church , scolding catholic " sourpusses " who hunt down rule - breakers and calling out a " tomb psychology " that " slowly transforms @entity81 into mummies in a museum			0
" and @entity8 says there 's no doubt @entity3 is already leaving his mark			2
" to this @entity2 who , for being a good pastor to his flock , especially to those who most need him , we all owe a tribute , a great tribute , " @entity8 said in a post about the initiative on his official website , making the case for @entity2 's lawmakers to act			2
" we believe that the way of being , the charisma and the humility of @entity3 have managed to revive global sympathy for the @entity45 , " he said			0
