-- my niece @entity1 is one of the do - gooders with an entrepreneurial bent who 's blurring nonprofit and for - profit activities			1
through micro-lending , @entity9 , creative marketing and a novel kind of stock offering , these disruptors are re-imagining charitable giving and re-purposing investment tools			2
now we need policies and financial instruments to catch up to the movement			2
@entity1 is one of more than 900,000 @entity21 lenders who have made more than $ 440 million in loans to entrepreneurs in 68 countries			2
@entity21 is a nonprofit organization that facilitates micro-loans			1
amounts as small as $ 25 can help someone -- usually a woman -- start or expand a business			2
the effects can be life changing			2
starting with the $ 1,000 @entity21 fund i gave her as a high school graduation gift , @entity1 found time during college to make 30 loans totaling $ 1,700 to entrepreneurs in 17 countries , from @entity38 to @entity39			1
as folks repay the loans , @entity1 keeps making new loans and helping more people change their lives			1
a funding pool that replenishes itself gives @entity21 an edge over typical charities			2
with most cash donations , when the receiving organization spends the money , it 's gone for good			2
there 's a catch : @entity1 can loan money to a grocer in @entity56 , a farmer in @entity39 and a weaver in @entity59 -- but she has not been able to loan money to entrepreneurs in the @entity62			2
because of technical and policy issues with the @entity65 , it 's easier to help entrepreneurs in another country than in our own backyard			1
the bright folks at @entity21 are creating a work - around			1
@entity72 is an experiment in " person - to - person lending			1
" using @entity72 , @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 , sought a loan to expand his barbecue and catfish restaurant			0
@entity82 in @entity83 is seeking a loan to move her home hair salon into a commercial space			0
she expects expansion to create three or four jobs			0
@entity72 comes along as @entity89 is bringing its micro-lending model to more @entity62 cities			0
thirty years after @entity93 laureate @entity92 created @entity94 , which has extended micro-finance to 8 million people in @entity97 , @entity89 now has branches in @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			1
some of the business - charity hybrids are counterintuitive			1
while many nonprofit groups ask local businesses for donations , the reverse is uncommon			1
yet @entity110 emerged from the @entity111 in 2009 with just that notion			0
he created a nonprofit organization , @entity113 , that raises rounds of capital to invest in startup companies			1
one foundation invented a new kind of stock offering to turn neighborhood stakeholders into real stockholders			0
fulfilling its commitment to " resident ownership , " the @entity122 wanted to transfer a chunk of the equity in a commercial development project to residents living nearby			0
it took attorneys six years and 40 drafts to invent a way , and in 2005 @entity133 issued the first - ever @entity134			1
residents purchased all 50,000 units of stock , priced at $ 10 per share			0
in @entity139 , dr. @entity138 began working with mothers who did n't have enough food			0
through witnesses to hunger , she put the mothers in front of elected officials to advocate for federal nutrition programs			0
@entity138 discovered that women from witnesses to @entity149 were also entrepreneurs			0
hustling to put food on the table for their kids , literally , these mothers were earning $ 50 here and there doing hair and nails or babysitting			0
problem is , no one treated these mothers as entrepreneurs			0
their business activities were discouraged or penalized , either because of overly enthusiastic local government regulations or upside - down rules of federal assistance programs			1
the reporting requirements , intended to deter fraud , were not calibrated to accommodate modest income fluctuations associated with their entrepreneurial activities			1
@entity138 is chipping away at change			0
her team is giving mothers technical assistance to bring their micro-businesses into the mainstream			0
she is connecting the women to bank accounts , and @entity138 's nonprofit will match deposits the mothers make into savings accounts and @entity9			1
the federal nutrition benefits should diminish gradually over time , as folks get on their feet			0
at a moment when we need innovative thinking , the old rules still use a bright - line test to force mothers to choose between food and work			1
further , we need more technical and policy advancements that make social investing easy			1
few organizations have the time and resources to chase legal solutions for six years			0
the next generation of leaders must generate breakthrough solutions that can operate at scale			0
a good place to start is @entity205 , which is hashtag - speak for a conference devoted to engaging the 80 million @entity62 millennials in giving and volunteerism			2
next month hundreds of professionals will gather in @entity103 at @entity205 to crack the code on millennials			0
expect millennials to keep blurring the lines			2
if @entity1 can loan $ 50 to a farmer in @entity216 , why not a hair dresser in @entity139 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			1

@entity219 : young people are taking entrepreneurial approach to charity
in many cases , he says , they *'re* blurring the line between for - profit and nonprofit
he says we need policy changes to make social investing easy
