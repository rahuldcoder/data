@entity0 -- protests outside the @entity3 in @entity0 continued into friday , after @entity3 president @entity4 issued what is being seen as a stern warning to @entity7 that relations between the two countries will be shaped by " how they respond to this incident			1
" " i do n't think that we would consider them an ally , but we do n't consider them an enemy , " @entity4 told @entity12 in an interview to be aired thursday night			1
" they 're a new government that is trying to find its way			0
i think that we are going to have to see how they respond to this incident			0
" in the interview , recorded wednesday , @entity4 said that if @entity7 takes actions that " indicate they 're not taking responsibilities , as all other countries do where we have embassies , i think that 's going to be a real big problem			1
" meanwhile , violent protests -- sparked by outrage over an anti-islam film made in the @entity38 and posted online -- marked their fourth day in @entity0			1
the film , which denigrates the @entity39 , has sparked protests across the region			0
clouds of tear gas wafted over the hulks of burned - out cars thursday as hundreds of demonstrators battled police 300 yards from the embassy			2
the demonstrators threw rocks and @entity52 cocktails at police and chanted , " with our souls , with our blood , we will sacrifice for you , @entity39			0
" at least 224 people were injured , according to @entity7 state television , @entity58			1
six things to know about the @entity61 attack images from friday morning showed throngs of people still massed in the area , with authorities stationed in front of them , under a dark sky			2
while there was ample activity and apparent commotion , there was no audible chanting or notable clashes evident between authorities and protesters			0
the protests , and @entity4 's comments , come during a delicate period in the relationship between the @entity38 and @entity7 under @entity82 , the country 's first democratically elected leader since the overthrow last year of longtime ruler @entity85			1
they also come amid heightened tensions at @entity3 diplomatic missions in the @entity89 and @entity90 following tuesday 's attack on the @entity3 @entity92 in @entity61 , @entity93 , that left ambassador @entity94 and three other @entity38 consular officials dead			1
that same day , police and @entity7 troops formed defensive lines around the embassy to prevent demonstrators who had also gathered there from advancing , but not before the protesters had scaled the embassy fence and placed a black flag atop a ladder in the @entity38 compound			2
police arrested four protesters , but the failure of @entity7 authorities to take action sooner has been widely questioned			2
some also questioned president @entity82 's response			2
he initially focused his criticism on the film as an unacceptable slap at @entity116			0
@entity94 's killing shines light on @entity120 sensitivities around @entity39 " the presidency condemns in the strongest terms the attempt of a group to insult the place of the messenger , the @entity39 ... and condemns the people who have produced this radical work , " the president said in a statement posted on his @entity124 page			2
" the @entity7 people , both @entity120 and @entity133 , refuse such insults on sanctities			2
" but after speaking with @entity4 in what the @entity136 described as a review of the " strategic partnership between the @entity38 and @entity7 , " @entity82 directly criticized the attacks for the first time thursday			1
" those who are attacking the embassies do not represent any of us , " he said in comments from @entity143 , @entity144 , where he was visiting the headquarters of the @entity146			0
@entity4 's comments were widely seen as a warning to @entity7 , which under @entity85 was widely considered a staunch @entity3 ally and remains a major recipient of @entity38 foreign aid			1
" i think it was a little bit of a strange choice of words to say that @entity7 is not an ally , " @entity156 analyst @entity155 said			1
" but i think that his purpose is to put president @entity82 on notice that he really has to do what 's necessary to prevent the escalation of these demonstrations in @entity0 to what we have seen , for example , in @entity93			1
" on thursday , @entity136 spokesman @entity169 said @entity4 used the correct " diplomatic and legal terms " in that the @entity38 and @entity7 do not have a formal alliance or mutual defense treaty			1
but , he said , @entity7 remains " a longstanding partner " of the @entity38 , and @entity3 officials have no intention of cutting aid to the country			1
@entity180 police , demonstrators hurt in @entity3 @entity3 clashes @entity183 analyst @entity182 said it was telling that the @entity38 seemed angrier about @entity82 's delayed response than it was when the country 's military government disbanded parliament this year			1
" after getting on ' right side ' of history , security still trumps democracy , " @entity182 posted on @entity189			0
" that 's fine ( and not surprising ) but let 's not pretend otherwise , " he said			0
but sen. @entity196 , @entity197 , said the president 's assessment was largely correct			0
" they have gone from a staunch ally under @entity85 to one which is a country that 's seeking its own way , " @entity196 said			0
he said that the @entity38 needs to have a good relationship with @entity7 , but that it is understandable why many in the @entity38 are displeased with its leaders			0
" they have a pretty big army , " @entity196 said			0
" they could have protected our embassy			0
" thursday 's protests were a continuation of demonstrations that broke out wednesday night near the embassy			1
protesters tried to push through barbed wire fencing protecting the embassy and set fire to two police trucks and a car , according to @entity223 , a spokesman for the @entity224			0
forces pushed back the protesters after the vehicles were set on fire			0
" forces were able to push them down toward @entity231 farther from the embassy street , " @entity229 said , adding that some arrests had been made			0
at least 13 protesters and six police officers were injured in the earlier clashes , @entity7 government officials said thursday			1
reaction to film fuels debate on free speech vs. hate speech @entity1 's @entity241 and @entity242 in @entity0 , and @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			2
