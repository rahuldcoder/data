from wearable technology to space tourism , 2014 will be a year of significant technological leaps			1
we take a look through some of the most ground - breaking developments of the year ahead			1
electric cars take to the track as the name suggests , @entity9 is all about electric power			1
the arrival of this new petrol - free motor racing competition is a significant step for both the car and the environment			2
two years ago motorsport 's international governing body , the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , announced its ambitious plan for an electric car race that would mimic the hugely popular @entity24 series			2
as the arrival of @entity9 looms , experts predict that it could have a big impact on the future of car manufacturing			1
initially , the cars in the competition will be powered by enormous battery engines			1
each battery weighs 200 kilograms , producing around 200 kilowatts of power			0
depending on the speed , the electric engines will last anywhere from a few hours to just 25 minutes and the cars can reach speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour			1
" if you look in the past , a lot of development in the car industry has come from racing , " said @entity9 ceo @entity39			1
" the transfer of technology is potentially very big			0
" space tourism blasts off after a number of false starts and delays , @entity48 is finally poised to lift off in 2014			1
billionaire @entity53 's planned commercial spacecraft underwent a successful test flight last year over @entity55 , making a commercial launch this year a distinct possibility			1
in september 2013 , @entity53 's @entity48 said @entity58 completed an important test , breaking the sound barrier as it climbed from 42,000 feet to 69,000 feet over the @entity61 before descended using its tilt - wing " feathering " maneuver			1
it was the second successful powered flight for @entity58 -- a craft designed to carry up to six passengers			0
initially , @entity48 flights are scheduled to be suborbital , but the hope is to take passengers further into space as the technology is refined			1
already , a host of famous names have signed up to head into near orbit including @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			0
" we could n't be more delighted to have another major supersonic milestone under our belts as we move toward a 2014 start of commercial service , " said @entity53 after the test flight last year			1
wind power blows stronger as scientists look to find alternatives to traditional fossil fuels , a number of major projects , including @entity90 ( in @entity92 ' @entity91 ) and @entity93 ( near @entity94 , @entity95 ) , are vying to become the first offshore windfarm in the @entity97 alongside power from volcanoes , waves , biomass and the sun , wind power is set to become a significant alternative energy source in 2014			2
are we finally heading to @entity105 ? a new type of engine , called the @entity108 ( or @entity108 ) will be tested in space in march			1
if successful it is estimated that it could reduce the time it takes to get to @entity105 from nine months to just three months			0
the technology -- an " advanced plasma space propulsion system " -- will be tested by @entity116 on the @entity117 , taking the prospect of interplanetary exploration one step closer			2
synthetic biology begins to grow @entity122 , the editor of @entity123 , a highly influential online design magazine , says that in his view 2014 's most significant emerging technologies will be in the field of synthetic biology			2
" this emerging field started to hit the headlines at the end of last year and will be huge in 2014 , " fairs say			1
" it involves the creation of new types of artificial life forms that perform useful functions			0
at the smallest scale it could mean man - made microbes that live inside your body and detect illness ; at the largest scale it could mean synthetic creatures that are released into the wild to clean up pollution or attack parasitic species			0
" wearable technology is on trend wearable technology fired some preliminary warning shots in 2013 with the release of the @entity154 and @entity155 smartwatches , but this year will see the arrival of a selection of truly innovative wearable devices			2
most notably , @entity159 is expected to launch this year , offering head - mounted computing that could , ultimately , make smartwatches and mobile phones a thing of the past			1
alongside @entity166 's new high - tech glasses , @entity129 says that in 2014 " technology will migrate onto the body as digital services are miniaturized and embedded in our clothing or worn against our skin			2
we already have @entity159 and wearable fitness trackers , but a vast array of services -- from health monitoring to augmented information ( telling you what 's around you and helping you navigate ) will become commonplace			0
" fairs points to clothing with in - built solar panels , devices that scan your body for disease , and self - repairing trainers as some of the more exciting wearable technologies on the near horizon			0
@entity191 , @entity192 at @entity193 , @entity195 's national laboratory for particle and nuclear physics , agrees			0
" this year 's @entity199 ces show is revealing new wearable technology , but what we 're going to see this year is the development and test - marketing of smart clothing , not just smart gadgets , " @entity191 says			1
" new fibers , new micro-sensors , and new communications protocols will allow your clothes to actually work for you and collect and process information			0
i suspect we 'll see some fashion statements first : clothes that change shape or color			0
then we 'll see clothes that do computing ; first step will be storing information			0
my socks will store today 's to - do list			0
" dark matter @entity191 also believes that 2014 will be a significant year for physics , particularly in the search for dark matter : " dark matter is being searched for in everyone 's sock drawer as well as deep underground and with satellites			1
the underground experiments are likely to find something before the @entity230 turns back on to try " making " it			0
we could see a conclusive discovery of weakly interacting , massive dark matter particles this year			2
that will blow your mind			0
" crowd - funding comes of age mid-way through 2014 new laws ( known as the jobs act ) will allow anybody to buy equity in start - ups through new online crowd - funding marketplaces			2
this will make it almost as easy for individuals to fund new technology ventures as it currently is to support a @entity252 project , bringing a flood of new capital to fledgling tech companies			0
" the ability to aggregate a bunch of individuals around a common funding goal is absolutely game changing , " @entity256 , founder and chief executive of @entity258 , an online trading company said			0
with these new laws in place , the rapid technology developments of 2014 may be dwarfed by innovations in 2015 and beyond			1

2014 will be a year of enormous technological leaps
launch of @entity9 promises rapid development for electric cars
@entity48 plans to launch tourist flights to space
could the @entity108 engine help humans reach the moon ?
