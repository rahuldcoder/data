in our @entity3 series , @entity1 correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events			1
@entity1 senior pentagon correspondent @entity9 reflects on the historic promotion of gen. @entity11 , the first woman to achieve @entity13 's highest rank			1
gen. @entity11 will command 133,000 personnel worldwide in the @entity15			1
( @entity1 ) -- watching @entity13 chief of staff @entity16 swear in his newest fellow four star -- the first woman to achieve the @entity13 's highest rank -- it was hard not to feel something truly historic was happening before your eyes			1
the cavernous @entity24 auditorium was packed with a constellation of multistarred senior officers , mostly men			0
there were broad smiles everywhere			0
it was both a sign of how far women have come in the @entity33 military and a reminder that women are still not full equals to their brothers - in - arms			1
" it 's taken a long time , probably longer than it should have , " @entity16 admitted in his congratulatory remarks			2
gen. @entity11 was beaming as @entity16 and her husband pinned the four stars on each of her shoulders , stars that carry with them the heavy burden of a " historic first			1
" " i did n't appreciate the enormity of the events until tidal waves of cards , letters , and e-mails started coming my way , " @entity11 said			1
" and i 've heard from men and women , from every branch of service ... from moms and dads who see this promotion as a beacon of hope for their own daughters			2
" one such letter came from master sgt. @entity67 , who served with @entity11 at @entity68			1
" now , you get to pin on our nation 's highest military rank , and i get to tell my 5 - and 7 - year - old daughters that they really can be anything that they want to be , even a general in the @entity13			1
" well , almost anything			0
technically , women are still barred by @entity78 from serving in direct ground combat -- a distinction that seems increasingly disconnected from the reality of modern warfare			1
still , i could n't help think how much attitudes had changed from when i first reported on the women in combat debate in 1993			1
@entity87 was president , and defense secretary @entity88 had ordered an end to the ban on women flying combat aircraft			1
the military saluted smartly and began trumpeting the breakthrough , even as some senior officers harbored deep reservations			0
i remember questioning the air force chief of staff gen. @entity97 , who made no secret of his personal opposition to allowing women in the cockpits of his fighter jets , about how he felt			1
" i 'm comfortable with it , and there 's always the small chance i was wrong , " @entity97 said			2
it sounded like self - deprecating humor , but anyone who knew @entity97 knew he really did think there was only a small chance he was wrong			2
at the time -- in the early ' 90s , after @entity113 -- the prevailing thought was summed up by @entity115 , a former member of the @entity116 on @entity117			0
" i do not believe the @entity33 public is ready to see @entity33 's daughters and sisters being paraded in downtown @entity121 as pows			2
and we know that our pilots run that risk , " she said at the time			0
that 's no longer a theoretical question			0
the fact is @entity33 women have been fighting and dying alongside men in both @entity131 and @entity132 -- two wars with no front lines			0
so far , 115 women have laid down their lives for their country in those wars			0
but the reason it took so long for a woman to earn four stars is because most full generals prove their mettle in combat			0
@entity11 , though she served the @entity147 , rose through the ranks of the @entity149			1
" history will no doubt take note of her achievement in breaking through this final brass ceiling to pin on a fourth star , " defense secretary @entity150 said at @entity11 's promotion ceremony , " but she would rather be known and remembered first and foremost as a @entity13 soldier			1
" @entity11 has a proud military history			2
a @entity11 has fought in every @entity33 war since the revolution			2
her great - grandfather , @entity163			0
gen. @entity164 , was the chief signal officer in @entity165 from 1898 to 1901			0
her father , @entity166 , is a veteran of three wars -- @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170			0
but it is the younger generation of @entity172 who are a living testament to the strides woman have made			0
her sister @entity175 was the third female helicopter pilot in the @entity13 , and her niece @entity177 is an @entity179 @entity178 pilot who recently returned from flying combat missions in @entity132			1
" if anyone is worried about the next generation of warriors , fear not , " says @entity11			2
" the bench is loaded with talented sailors , airmen , soldiers , and @entity188			0
and while i know i may be the first woman to achieve this honor , i know with certainty i wo n't be the last			0
