-- at a time when partisan politics are bitter , midterm election races are tight and almost every legislative effort is stalled , who would you expect to take the boldest step in years to address the deadliest war in the world , in the heart of @entity11 ? @entity12 , of course			0
quietly , over the past four presidential administrations , a powerful and deep bipartisan consensus has developed in @entity12 in support of a stronger @entity18 policy toward @entity11			0
the latest manifestation of this cooperation is a small but potent provision addressing @entity23 's " conflict minerals , " folded into the recently passed @entity25 reform bill			1
the trade in four conflict minerals -- tin , tantalum , tungsten ( the @entity31 ) , as well as gold -- fuels the war in eastern @entity23 today			1
it 's been the deadliest war in the world since @entity37 we regularly travel to eastern @entity23 , and on our last trip , we traced the minerals from the mines			2
at the mines , we saw militiamen armed with @entity45 machine guns standing over miners and forcing them to work and pay bribes , including child miners as young as 11			0
we then crossed through army and rebel checkpoints , where smugglers paid off the commanders in @entity18 dollars , and then witnessed how these same minerals were packed into barrels with @entity23 flags on them and loaded onto planes and flown out of the country			2
we 've seen how armed groups on all sides of the conflict are reaping hundreds of millions of dollars per year by controlling mines and trading routes , selling minerals to international traders and smelters , which in turn sell them to electronics and jewelry companies			2
by requiring that publicly listed manufacturers who use these minerals conduct independent audits of their supply chains , this legislation will help curb the conflict minerals trade			1
courageous members of @entity12 from both parties fought hard together with a coalition of faith - based organizations , women 's rights advocates and student groups for the past two years to enact this law , standing up for what is right and bravely battling against special - interest lobbyists			2
but some companies would have you believe otherwise and are using negative tactics to stall reform			0
some critics in the corporate world have accused those campaigning for an end to the conflict minerals trade of advocating for a boycott of electronics companies			1
some minerals trading companies have also argued that @entity12 and the conflict minerals movement will force them to pull out of @entity23 , creating an embargo and hurting miners			1
these statements significantly distort what human rights advocates in @entity23 and the @entity18 are pressing for			0
let 's first be clear : the statements originate with many of the same companies that have been knowingly purchasing conflict minerals for the past decade , according to the @entity112 , and did nothing for years to avoid them			1
the bill and our campaign aim to develop a peaceful , legal minerals trade in @entity23 that will be the real benefit to war - torn communities on the ground			1
we oppose a boycott and , on the contrary , are asking consumers to urge their own cell phone , laptop and jewelry companies to ensure their products are conflict - free			1
companies now have an opportunity to achieve this goal and help @entity23 communities through three key steps : -- tracing : determining the precise sources of their minerals			2
-- auditing : independently verifying these sources and trading routes			0
-- certifying : working with the @entity23 , @entity137 , @entity18 and other governments to develop a certification process that improves upon systems already created for other exports such as blood diamonds			0
these steps are complex , but they are achievable			0
the reality is that the bill will accelerate this supply chain reform , and @entity147 and @entity148 are already starting a forward - looking audit process to purchase tantalum from legitimate mines , including those in @entity23			1
companies have at least 18 months from now to report to @entity12 on their audits , and during that time they will have ample opportunity to trace , audit and certify their supply chains			0
some companies may choose to temporarily stop buying minerals from @entity23 while they reform their supply chains			2
in order to cushion the blow for those mining communities affected by such a decision , a miners ' livelihood fund should be created to offer them real opportunities and help the @entity23 economy through small business , microfinance and agriculture			0
electronics , jewelry and minerals companies should partner with donors to set up this program as soon as possible			0
@entity12 has taken the first step , but we still have a long way to go in ending the conflict minerals trade and the war in @entity23			1
now the @entity183 administration must come through and partner with the @entity23 government to help create a process for conflict minerals that builds on the lessons of the process that excluded blood diamonds from the marketplace , as well as addressing wider issues of army and governance reform			1
and electronics and jewelry companies should support these processes with a fraction of the profits they 've earned from these conflict minerals over the past dozen years			1
consumers , companies and governments can all play a part in ending this deadly trade and cutting off the fuel for the deadliest war in the world			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 and @entity213 .			0

@entity23 's " conflict minerals " used in cell phones , other products , **co-authors** say
financial regulation law requires makers of electronics to audit supply sources
**co-authors** : consumers should urge companies to make products conflict - free
they say @entity183 administration should work with the @entity23 to develop legitimate mining
