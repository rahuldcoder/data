@entity0 , @entity1 and two years ago , agencies @entity8 and @entity10 listened to hundreds of @entity12 voices talking about sexual and reproductive health and rights			1
these were n't the voices of presidents , parliamentarians , politicians , advocates , or activists discussing laws , principles , precepts and policy			2
they were the voices of young teenage girls in @entity3 and @entity1 , speaking directly about their experiences , in a project called " @entity29			1
" though not exclusively so , the prime " risk " in question was teenage pregnancy : the risk of becoming pregnant ; the risks associated with unsafe abortion ; and those associated with poor maternal health provision			1
i was involved as an analyst : reviewing the responses with a view to answering three very straightforward questions			0
first , why are teenage girls from poor backgrounds so at risk of teenage pregnancy ? secondly , what is the impact of teenage pregnancy and early motherhood on these girls lives ? thirdly , what do girls say about the availability of appropriate services and information ? the depth and extent of detail which emerged from what these hundreds of girls said was overwhelming			1
see also : high - profile teen pregnancies in spotlight what was most striking was how attitudes and actions which we would consider extreme were related as commonplace occurrences			0
i talk of rape , incest , abuse and gender - based violence ; of girls routinely pressured by parents into marriage , multiple relationships with " sugar daddy " partners , or sex work to secure the basics of survival ; of the immense physical and psychological trauma caused by years of conflict and the use of rape as a weapon of war ; of unsafe abortion resulting in sickness or death ; of economic independence denied through forced removal from education it is a familiar litany : one which it 's possible to become desensitized to through repetition			2
but as i looked over the transcripts of the interviews , the words of these girls ( so matter - of - factly stated ) , came as a real jolt			2
if you want to know what these girls said , verbatim , i 'd urge you to look at one of the two " in their own words "			2
sexual and reproductive health and rights publications are often hard to read or understand			0
this is elegant in the simplicity of its expression and the clarity of its message			0
it may seem to you to be the wrong message to be highlighting on @entity119 , which should be celebratory			1
@entity119 this year is about " connecting girls , inspiring futures "			1
see also : @entity12 's birth rate : ' why women must be free to choose ' " @entity29 " connected girls : it brought them together to share knowledge and experience and to disseminate their thoughts and opinions and testimony on a world stage			1
critically , it subsequently served to inspire futures : the futures of individuals , and the futures of communities			0
in @entity3 , for example , @entity139 was inspired to set up the exquisitely - named " girls of @entity142 and @entity143 "			2
it answers girls ' needs for a space of their own ( one not dominated by boys ) for learning vocational skills and for continuing their education			0
@entity139 says , " twenty five girls attend the club which is located in the @entity153			0
i help them improve their reading skills and develop good manners			0
my plan is to ensure that every young girl in @entity3 has a quality education and information about sexual and reproductive health -- but i will need more support to make that happen			0
" " the girls of @entity142 and @entity143 , " in microcosm , offers a solution to many of the ills which our analysis of the interviews in the " @entity171 " project revealed , and meets many of the recommendations which the team subsequently made			1
the call was for better signposting to sexual and reproductive health services , for girls - only spaces , for health education and promotion programs to counter myths and misinformation , for confidence and self - esteem building initiatives , and for vocational training to foster economic independence			0
in addition , courses for pregnant teenagers and mothers on baby and childcare , and a concerted drive to reverse policies which prevent pregnant teenagers staying in school , and the foundations for a revolution in teenage girls ' lives are in place			1
what it needs is the will and the support ( the support that @entity139 calls for ) to make it happen			0
i have worked in sexual and reproductive health in @entity12 and around the world for 20 years			1
i am profoundly optimistic that change is achievable , and the more we make the world aware of what young women are forced to endure in countries such as @entity3 and @entity1 , the more quickly that change will come			0
something definitely to be celebrated on @entity119			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222			2

*''* girls at risk " project allows young @entity12 girls to deal with their issues such as teenage pregnancy
@entity222 was able to gain an understanding of the risks young girls face
@entity234 hopes to use @entity119 to better connect young girls and get their voices heard
