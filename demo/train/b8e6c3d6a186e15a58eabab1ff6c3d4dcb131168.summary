he was carrying a small amount of cash , some candy and an iced tea			0
@entity21 told police he shot @entity13 in self defense , authorities said			1
" when you add it up , it just does n't even make sense , " said @entity37 , the @entity13 family 's attorney			1
" @entity13 , a kid , has a bag of @entity44			1
( @entity21 ) had a 9 mm gun			2
@entity13 did n't approach @entity21 , @entity21 approached @entity13			1
so how can he now assert self defense ? " a gunshot can be heard on the 911 calls recorded that night , police said			1
the @entity13 family has sought to make the tapes available , but state attorney @entity52 said tuesday the calls will not be made public until the investigation is complete			2
" @entity13 and his family , interested persons , and the public - at - large are entitled to no less than a through , deliberate and just review of the information provided , along with any other evidence that may or may not be developed in the course of the review process , " @entity52 's office said in a statement			2
" we intend to honor that commitment			0
" the shooting has sparked an outrage in the community , with some accusing @entity21 , who is white , of profiling the black teenager			2
ireporter : ' unconscious racism ' behind shooting ? numerous @entity2 attempts to contact @entity21 were unsuccessful , and it is unclear whether he has retained an attorney			2
police said they have not charged him because there are no grounds to disprove his story of what happened			0
" the evidence and testimony we have so far does not establish that mr. @entity21 did not act in self defense			0
we do n't have anything to dispute his claim of self - defense , at this point , with the evidence and testimony that we have , " @entity29 said			0
@entity29 said the 911 directions asking @entity21 not to confront the teenager are not mandatory instructions			1
" that is a call taker making a recommendation to him			0
he 's not under a legal obligation to do that , so that is not something we can charge him with , " he said			0
" but it would have been a good outcome ... if @entity13 and @entity21 never came in contact with one another			1
" in a letter sent to @entity108 attorney general @entity107 , the @entity105 expressed doubt in the @entity110 and asked the @entity111 to review the case			0
