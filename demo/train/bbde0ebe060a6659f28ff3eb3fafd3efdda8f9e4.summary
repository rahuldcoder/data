-- @entity1 continued their worst start to a season since the @entity5 league was founded in 1933 as they lost 3 - 1 at home to @entity7 , with fans of the @entity10 club further suffering as their city rivals went top of the table			1
already knocked out of the @entity13 and the @entity14 , @entity1 are now 18 points behind @entity7 and second - placed @entity16 , who both boast 29 points , and just four points off the bottom of the @entity22			0
traditionally one of the big three of the @entity5 game , @entity1 have - along with @entity7 and @entity16 - won all but two of the 78 titles in the country 's football history			1
yet a club that won its last league title in 2002 , and which last competed in the @entity32 three years ago ( when suffering a humiliating 12 - 1 aggregate defeat to @entity34 ) , is now in greater danger of suffering the first relegation in its history			2
despite leading at the break after a fine @entity40 goal , @entity1 surrendered in the second half as striker @entity42 had a hand in all three goals -- forcing two own goals either side of netting an 81st - minute penalty to preserve the @entity49 ' unbeaten run			0
after @entity52 defender @entity51 was sent off for saving a goalbound effort with his hand , @entity50 slid home a cool penalty to spark an exodus for @entity1 fans from the @entity59			0
@entity61 coach @entity60 only took charge of @entity1 , who won the @entity64 in the 1960s and lost the @entity14 final in their own stadium in 2005 , one month ago -- becoming the club 's seventh coach in just four seasons			0
" in the second half , @entity1 had great difficulty in keeping up with our game , because we always had a strong and intense style of play , " @entity7 coach @entity71 told his club 's official website			2
" we beat a great team , one that will improve			0
" while @entity7 's @entity49 regained confidence after last week 's @entity32 exit , @entity1 's current predicament makes a mockery of the team 's stated ambition upon its founding -- which was to be " a great club , as great as the greatest in @entity89			1
" elsewhere across the continent , @entity90 extended their unbeaten league run to five games after drawing 0 - 0 at @entity94 -- a result which left the @entity97 side , who lost striker @entity99 to a late red card , three points behind third - placed @entity102 in @entity103 earlier , @entity104 climbed three places to eighth in the table after winning 2 - 0 at @entity107 -- as goals from @entity109 and @entity110 took the @entity112 side just behind @entity113 in @entity103 in the @entity115 , @entity114 beat @entity116 2 - 1 at home to end a run of seven games without a win , as @entity121 and @entity122 scored either side of a dipping @entity125 strike for the visitors .			1
