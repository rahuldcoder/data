-- while president - elect @entity2 will certainly be making history when he takes the oath of office on january 20 , he 'll also be repeating it -- by placing his hand on the same @entity7 that @entity8 used during the inauguration of 1861			1
the 1861 @entity10 against the backdrop of the @entity12 of the @entity13			0
the @entity14 does not require presidents to be sworn in on a @entity7 , though almost every chief executive since @entity17 has chosen to do so			1
presidents have differed greatly , however , on the question of which passage the @entity7 should be opened to during the swearing - in ceremony			1
it brings up the question of what -- if any -- biblical passage @entity2 will emphasize			1
if what is past is prologue , as @entity25 famously wrote ( a quote now engraved in front of the @entity28 ) , he might opt for the popular presidential theme of repentance			0
according to @entity34 , a presidential historian at @entity36 's @entity35 , @entity33 was used for three swearing - in ceremonies : " if my people , who are called by my name , will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways , then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land			0
" in this season of economic distress , however , the president - elect may prefer to follow the lead of @entity49			0
when @entity49 first took the oath of office in 1933 , the country was reeling under the crushing weight of the @entity54			0
" only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment , " @entity49 said in his inaugural address			0
urging his fellow @entity59 to lend a helping hand , @entity49 had the @entity7 opened to @entity61 13 : " and now abideth faith , hope , charity , these three ; but the greatest of these is charity			2
" @entity2 campaigned as someone who would strive to bridge the nation 's bitter partisan divide			1
" we have never been a collection of red states and blue states , " @entity2 said in his election night victory speech			2
" we are , and always will be , the @entity59			0
" if @entity2 wants to stress that theme again on january 20 , he may prefer to follow @entity78 's lead from the 1997 inaugural and open the @entity7 to @entity80 : " thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations , and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach			1
" questions of war and peace are always in the back of any president 's mind			0
@entity2 campaigned in part on a promise to end @entity59 's war in @entity96			1
shortly after winning the @entity97 on a similar pledge to end another divisive conflict -- this one in @entity100 -- @entity101 took the oath with a family @entity7 opened to @entity104 : " and he shall judge among the nations , and shall rebuke many people : and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more			2
" with the polls showing an overwhelming majority of @entity59 convinced the country is on the wrong track , @entity2 might hint at a back - to - basics message by doing what @entity121 did in 1913			2
during his first inaugural , @entity121 opened the @entity7 to @entity124 , which concludes " i have gone astray like a lost sheep ; seek thy servant ; for i do not forget thy commandments			2
" speaking of a return to basics , what about @entity59 's first president ? what did @entity17 do ? almost 220 years ago , in 1789 , @entity134 opened the @entity136 version of a @entity7 to @entity137 -- " @entity138 shall dwell at the haven of the sea ; and he shall be for a haven of ships ; and his border shall be unto @entity144			1
" was @entity59 's first president trying to send a deep , profound message ? not exactly			0
it turns out that , for the nation 's first inaugural , the @entity7 was hastily opened to a completely random page			1
the same thing was done 72 years later when @entity8 was sworn in			1
@entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 will be sworn in using same @entity7 as @entity8
@entity8 's @entity7 was turned to a random page at his 1861 inauguration
many presidents choose to open @entity7 to a *specific* verse
