@entity0 , @entity1 -- at first glance of friday 's @entity5 , you might think the @entity6 has taken over the newspaper			1
@entity9 's colorful character in @entity11 's new film " @entity12 " dominates a faked front page , which includes the paper 's traditional flag and two stories that appeared in the paper last month			1
@entity5 spokesman @entity18 said the " cover - wrap " was an " unusual opportunity to stretch the usual boundaries and design an innovative ad designed to create buzz			1
" @entity24 , a senior journalism scholar at the @entity25 , said tough economic times and lower ads sales have forced newspapers to tear down the ethics wall that separated a paper 's front page from advertisers			1
" the wall became in recent years a fence , but the @entity5 has created a swinging gate , " @entity24 said			1
" what offends my traditional sensibilities is the notion that you would be willing to deceive the reader into thinking that this was the actual front page , " @entity24 said			0
although @entity18 said readers would not be confused by the fake front , several journalists in @entity2 's @entity0 bureau did not immediately realize that the real front page was inside			1
a @entity5 reader who works for a movie marketing company in @entity49 said he felt deceived by the ad			1
he asked not to be identified because his company , which was not involved in the @entity11 campaign , deals with the newspaper			0
" we propose these kinds of ads all the time but have never gotten them approved , " he said			0
" i do n't always agree with what we do			0
" he estimated that the ad would cost " well over $ 100,000			1
" @entity18 would not disclose the price , but he said , " our front page section is our most valued real estate			1
the ad was priced accordingly			2
" the use of real newspaper stories , published previously in the newspaper , to make the ad appear to be a real front page is another issue , @entity24 said			1
" i 'm particularly nervous about them running fake stories that are really real stories , " he said			1
" that seems like a misappropriation of the journalism in the newspaper			0
" an online search revealed that the article on the left column -- headlined " to take reins on health proposal " -- was a slightly altered version of a story written by @entity85 @entity84 reporter @entity83			0
it was published february 18			2
the second article , appearing on the right column of the @entity11 ad , was headlined " @entity90			2
" the original story was published february 19 , with the bylines of @entity5 foreign correspondent @entity93 and @entity95 bureau chief @entity94			1
" if i had written one of those stories , i would be pissed , " @entity24 said			2
@entity2 has received no response from e-mails and calls to the three journalists			0
although they may not be pleased with their work being used in a movie ad -- without the byline -- they have jobs while many of their co-workers have been laid off			2
the @entity111 , the paper 's parent , has ordered several rounds of staff cuts at its newspapers and bureau in recent years			2
some have left in protest of changes in editorial practices aimed at boosting revenue , @entity24 said			0
" there 's been one editor after another that 's walked out the door because they did n't want to cave in to pressure from the top to do the wrong thing , " @entity24 said			0
what he might have objected to five years ago , he could now accept it helps papers survive , @entity24 said			0
but not if it confuses editorial content with ads , he said			0
" every time i see a big ad in my local newspaper i send up a little cheer , " he said			0
when @entity144 paid the newspaper for a wrap - around ad last summer , for the vampire series " @entity148 , " it was not mixed with the flag or editorial content			0
the @entity5 drew criticism in april when it sold @entity152 the right column of its front page , where a lead story is normally placed			1
the network used the space to advertise the debut of its " @entity160 " series .			0

@entity5 ' " @entity12 " ad uses two real stories published last month
tough economy forces newspapers to tear down ethics wall , *expert* says
one estimate has ad costing more than $ 100,000
