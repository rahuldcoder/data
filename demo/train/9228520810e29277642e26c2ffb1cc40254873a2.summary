@entity0 has unveiled a new product , @entity2 , at an event everyone knew would have something to do with phones and apps and operating systems			1
" we 're not building a phone and we 're not building an operating system , " ceo @entity9 said thursday			1
" but we 're also building something that 's a whole lot deeper than just another app. " @entity15 , ok			2
thanks for clarifying that , @entity9			2
in all seriousness , though , here 's the breakdown on home , a feature @entity0 hopes will make it part of everything you do on your phone			1
what is it ? as described by @entity9 and others , home is a " family of apps " that essentially push @entity0 content front and center on your @entity37 phone			1
once the phone " wakes up , " the home screen and lock screen are replaced with something called " @entity41			1
" images and posts from friends will appear as the new screen 's background			1
users can flip through and interact with them -- " like " an update , or post a comment -- immediately without having to open a specific @entity0 app. one touch takes the user to their apps , or back to the last app they were using			1
home 's other big feature was called " chat heads , " which is a basically a tool that combines @entity63 with the phone 's regular @entity65 text - message tool			1
messages pop up regardless of what the user is doing at the time , along with the sender 's profile picture , enclosed in a little circle			2
the user can decide whether to open the message ( without leaving the app or other screen they 're on ) , dismiss it or save it for later with a single touch			0
when and where can i get it ? home will be available in the @entity85 mobile store on april 12 for at least some @entity37 phones			1
users will be able to choose whether to install it permanently , or for a one - off trial session			0
at release , it will only be optimized for @entity93 's @entity92 and @entity94 and the @entity96 line of phones			0
it will run on the @entity99 and the @entity96 when those phones are released , with other phones being added in the coming months			0
@entity0 said a version for tablets will be released " within several months			0
" how about my @entity104 ? your wait might be quite a bit longer			0
or , you know , forever			0
during the event , @entity9 repeatedly talked about how @entity112 's open @entity37 system was the perfect place to build home			1
it 's not unusual for mobile - device makers , most notably @entity116 with its @entity118 tablets , to tweak the system to suit their own needs			2
@entity123 , on the other hand , has a very closed operating system , giving its developers far less leeway in exchange for what the company says is a smoother , better - developed user experience			2
creating something like home for @entity123 's @entity134 system would require an almost unprecedented partnership between the companies			1
" anything that happens with @entity123 is going to happen with partnership , " @entity9 said			0
" @entity112 's @entity37 is open so we do n't have to work with them			1
" still , @entity0 is n't ruling out the possibility , at least not officially			0
" this is a first step and we 're continuing to iterate , " a @entity0 spokeswoman said in response to @entity104 questions			0
" we chose to start building on @entity37 because we could build a more deeply integrated mobile experience			1
we 'll continue to test and iterate on the @entity0 experience across all platforms			0
" what happened to the @entity0 phone i was hearing about ? well , there 's not one			2
while rumors to that effect have swirled for a couple of years , @entity0 has always maintained it was n't " making " a phone			2
but at wednesday 's event , @entity96 unveiled the @entity159 , an @entity161 exclusive @entity37 phone that will be released the same day @entity2 goes live			1
the phone will have home pre-loaded as the default version of its operating system			1
so it 's the closest thing to a @entity0 phone for now			2
unveiled by ceo @entity169 , the @entity159 will be a mid-range phone that looks vaguely like an @entity104 , with a 4.3 - inch screen and dual - core @entity172			2
it will sell for $ 99 in the @entity174			0
folks looking for a high - end @entity96 phone may be more inclined to wait for the @entity96 , which launches on april 19			1
what are folks saying ? " jokes aside , i think home is a very smart thing for @entity0 to do			2
really is a blanket over @entity37			1
need to play with it			0
" -- @entity183 , columnist , @entity184 " wonder when @entity186 and others will introduce their own " super apps " that take over lock screen , home page ...			1
. " -- @entity191 , senior writer , @entity192 " it 's nice - looking enough , for what it is			0
but what it is is an assumption that users want to use @entity0 to filter everything they do with their smartphones ...			0
putting friends first is n't a bad concept for the smartphone experience			0
but @entity0 thinks that friends = @entity0 and @entity0 = friends			0
if this were ever true , it is n't now			0
" -- @entity209 , columnist , @entity210 's			0

@entity2 is a family of apps for the @entity37 system
it puts photos and posts from the site front and center on your phone
" @entity225 " also joins @entity63 and *sms* texts
home will be available on @entity85 starting april 12
