editor 's note : @entity2 , a reformed hoarder , offers her best cures for clutter			1
( @entity6 ) -- 1			1
in my youth , i was fearless			1
i forged strong friendships and created a history for myself that seemed worth remembering			2
so i held on to every trinket from my past			2
but i kept so many of these historical artifacts ( see hair , @entity17 's ) that i did n't have any room for the present			1
i wanted to throw parties and have friends to visit in a home where they could actually sit down			2
so i photographed those hold things , then cleared them out to make space for the next chapters of my life			1
a hefty chuck of what i moved into our home was obsolete computer equipment			2
when i looked at it , i saw dollar signs			2
then my economist friend , @entity35 , reminded me of the fallacy of sunk costs			2
i was sizing up those old computers based on what i had spent rather than their present value : close to zero			2
i sold the lot to a used - electronics store for $ 60 ( not bad , considering ) and got a much needed haircut with the cash			2
@entity46 to stay cool under pressure 3			2
i liked to think of myself as someone who exercised every day by running on a giant motorized treadmill , read all the literary classics , and baked cookies for every special occasion			2
the reality ? i am not a runner , i like to read pop fiction , and cookies are n't really my thing			1
the treadmill , the boxes of books , and some kitchen gadgets all found new homes			2
trust me : you wo n't fix it			1
most of the broken things i had brought with me were shoes			1
heels or straps had come off , and i was convinced i would someday have them repaired			0
my husband held the shoes up in front of me , pair by pair , and asked two questions : " if you saw these shoes in a store today , would you buy them ? " and " if you say yes , how much would you pay for them ? " in all but one case , i admitted that i would n't buy the shoes again			1
and those red kitten heels with the broken sole ? the amount i was wiling to pay was less than the cost of having them fixed			0

do look a gift horse in the mouth			0
my decorating tastes may change over time , but i am fairly certain i will never enjoy a home filled with a series of rhinestone - accented paintings of scary clowns			0
yet i had hoarded these and other unattractive presents because i thought that was the decent thing to do			0
i also was n't sure what i would say if someone noticed his gift missing and asked why			1
well , you know what ? no one has			0
not even the bestower of scary clowns			0
i had a used @entity109 740 @entity108 that was the first car i had purchased after college			0
before i moved @entity112 , i lived in the @entity113 , where it was tough to get around without a car			0
in @entity112 , however , we lived next to a metro station , and there was a grocery store two blocks away			0
the price of parking -- $ 150 a month -- sealed it : the @entity108 was @entity125 - @entity124 @entity6 : 5 ways to develop thick skin 7			0
just admit that you do n't like it			1
as i sorted through my stuff , i became aware of the fact that i did n't even want some of it			1
there were things i did n't exactly like but did n't exactly hate -- and so lived with them out of pure apathy			1
this was the easiest clutter to set free			1
all it took was a little motivation to pack up a few boxes and drop them off at a local charity			0
know what you really need			0
often what we need is only related to the thing we have			0
for instance , i had a huge popcorn maker but could easily pop the modest amount of corn we consumed in a small pot on the stove			0
i also had thousands of documents in bulky filing cabinets			1
but i needed the information on the pages , not the paper itself			1
i kept just the documents i had to have in their original form , scanned and saved others as digital files , and tossed the rest - eliminating 300 pounds of paper			1

let go of the guilt			0
when my grandparents passed away , i inherited a collection of 27 rusty knives , a warped cookie sheet , and a copper bracelet my grandmother had loved to wear			0
i kept all these items for more than a decade			0
eventually i realized that if my grandparents were alive , they would have replaced the cookie sheet and knife set ( and been mortified that my aunts had passed on such dangerous accoutrements )			1
i recycled the kitchen implements , but i kept the bracelet , which i wear and enjoy as much as my grandmother did			0
face it : " one day " almost never comes			0
i justified keeping half my wardrobe on the basis that i would use it one day			0
the hot pink bridesmaid dress from my cousin 's first wedding took up space in my closet for four times the length of her marriage			1
i hate throwing out potentially useful things			1
but we could n't afford a larger apartment ; storing all those " one day " items would cost more than they were worth ; and , an even simpler truth , i have yet to be invited to an event at which a fuchsia dress with taffeta bows might seem appropriate			1
