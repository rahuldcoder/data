as @entity2 president @entity1 opens the @entity3 in @entity4 on february 7 , there will be relief hidden behind his characteristically guarded smile			1
for @entity1 , the past two years have witnessed a remarkable recovery			1
two years ago , @entity1 seemed to be on the ropes			1
tens of thousands of @entity10 were flooding central squares to protest a parliamentary election they said had been tarnished by massive fraud			0
his approval ratings were in free fall , having dropped 15 points since december 2010 , according to polls from @entity10 's @entity19			1
internationally , @entity1 was also on the defensive			1
he appeared to have isolated himself by backing the wrong horse in @entity23 's civil war			2
as rebels closed in on the @entity27 suburbs , many observers thought @entity23 president @entity28 , whom @entity1 supported , would soon be swept from power			1
if so , @entity2 stood to lose its only @entity31 military outpost , the naval station it leased at @entity33			0
the @entity37 , alarmed at the continent 's dependence on @entity2 gas , had raided offices of the @entity2 company @entity39 in @entity40 and the @entity41 and was planning further investigations			2
when built , a projected @entity37 - and @entity45 - supported @entity44 pipeline threatened to pump gas from @entity46 to @entity47 , undercutting @entity2 supplies			0
not since the height of the global financial crisis had @entity1 seemed so embattled			1
today , things look quite different			0
over the following year , the @entity10 protests died away			2
@entity1 's ratings stabilized in the low 60s , a level many @entity54 leaders would envy			1
with a mixture of new repressive laws , prosecutions and co-optation tactics , the @entity58 managed to box in and divide its domestic critics			0
so confident did @entity1 feel by mid- 2013 that he could , without losing sleep , allow the opposition activist @entity66 to run for mayor of @entity10 ( he lost , though with an impressive 27 % ) and pardon his nemesis , the imprisoned former oligarch @entity68 , allowing him to leave for @entity69			1
@entity1 's star has also risen on the international stage			1
in september , he persuaded @entity28 to pledge to give up his chemical weapons , saving president @entity73 from a military intervention the @entity45 leader clearly dreaded			0
@entity76 looks more secure today than he has since protests against his rule began			2
by granting asylum to the @entity81 leaker @entity82 , @entity1 managed -- ironically , given @entity2 's own record of secrecy and spying -- to place himself on the side of a global movement for greater transparency and respect for citizens ' privacy			1
one example : the @entity94 , in a recent editorial , called @entity82 's revelations " a great service " and urged @entity73 to end @entity82 's vilification and offer him " a plea bargain or some form of clemency			2
" in a showdown with the @entity37 over the future of @entity103 in november , @entity1 again came out on top , persuading @entity103 president @entity105 to reject a trade deal with @entity107 to which @entity108 had committed its prestige			1
instead , @entity105 pledged to deepen his country 's trade ties with @entity2 , prompting furious protests from @entity113			1
as for @entity39 , its sales of gas to @entity107 rose by 16 % in 2013 to a record high			0
the @entity44 pipeline failed to line up committed gas supplies			0
according to one of the consortium 's partners , as of june the project was " over			2
" most of these successes are temporary , and time is not on the @entity58 's side			1
fighting continues to rage in @entity23 , and the destruction of @entity28 's chemical weapons has been painfully slow			2
@entity103 will sooner or later integrate with @entity107			0
@entity105 is struggling to stay in power as violence flares nightly in central @entity133			0
@entity39 's buoyant sales reflected an unusually cold winter in @entity107			2
at home , the frustrations that fueled the demonstrations two years ago have not gone away , just lost a focus			1
a major economic deterioration could prompt a new , potentially more consequential wave of protests			2
@entity2 's growth rate has been falling steadily , reaching just 1.4 % by the end of 2013 , the lowest rate of @entity1 's years as president			1
and the @entity58 has no serious strategy to restart the economic engines			0
for now , @entity1 still has reason to feel confident			2
even @entity4 , which could have turned into a political disaster , might well pass off positively for the @entity58			0
the advance bad press has lowered expectations so much that the @entity153 will seem something of a success if they merely take place without the stadium collapsing or terrorists exploding bombs in @entity4 itself			0
the de facto boycott by @entity54 leaders over @entity2 intolerance toward gays will probably buy @entity1 a little support at home since most @entity2 share his discomfort with " nontraditional lifestyles " and do not like outsiders telling them what to do			2
in a recent poll , 73 % agreed the state should ban public displays of homosexuality			0
what explains this turnaround ? @entity1 has benefited more from luck than skill			1
even without new repressive measures , the wave of demonstrations was bound to subside , following the natural ebb and flow of protest movements			0
those that climax without producing leader turnover tend to lose momentum , though some might reignite months or years later			0
in international affairs , @entity1 profited from the mistakes of the @entity54			1
@entity73 , having backed himself into a corner with talk of " red lines " and facing a humiliating veto in @entity196 , had to smile and accept help on @entity23 from the leader he had recently taunted for his " slouch			0
" the @entity37 overplayed its hand in @entity103 , insisting on terms that @entity105 thought would damage him politically			0
@entity1 , offering a bailout with fewer visible strings attached , walked away with the @entity103 leader 's agreement			1
one may debate whether the real mistake in the @entity82 case was the extent of @entity45 spying or the lax security that allowed @entity82 to expose it			0
either way , it was a @entity45 blunder , which landed unexpectedly in @entity1 's lap. at some point , @entity1 's luck is bound to run out			1
both at home and abroad , political challenges loom in 2014			0
still , as he prepares to greet and congratulate the @entity224 athletes , @entity2 's president is on a roll .			0

two years ago , @entity1 was in trouble , with *widespread* protests and falling ratings
@entity231 says @entity1 's fortunes have rebounded as the @entity234 approach
@entity1 's ratings are up and he 's had successes in international issues , @entity231 says
@entity231 : @entity1 faces economy with fading growth , and his luck could run out
