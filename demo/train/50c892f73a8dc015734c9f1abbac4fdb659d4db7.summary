-- do n't pack away those winter coats and hats yet ! we 're in for another blast of cold @entity6 air , which is gearing up to roll across most of the country this week , but it wo n't be as bad as the shocking freeze in january			1
the @entity10 says some places from the central @entity12 to the @entity14 and @entity13 could be having some frosty high temperatures , as low 20 to 30 degrees below normal			1
if you call it @entity19 ( or @entity20 ) , meteorologists say you 'd be wrong -- nor was the first big cold spell of 2014 , strictly speaking , a strike of the @entity23			1
the @entity23 stays anchored over @entity24 , to the north of @entity26 , and does n't move , says @entity0 meteorologist @entity27			2
but its shifting pattern allows cold @entity6 air to spill southward into the @entity12			2
" when it weakens , this allows the cold @entity6 air that is often mislabeled the " @entity23 " to spill southward across the @entity12 border and bring us bone - chilling temperatures , " @entity27 explained			1
so from a technical perspective , " if you 're looking to get ' struck ' by the vortex , you 're out of luck , " he added			0
although this cold snap does n't have as menacing a name , the @entity6 air blast will cause temperatures to plummet 25 to 35 degrees below average east of the @entity44 , @entity27 said			2
temperatures will drop tuesday to 10 to 30 degrees below normal for this time of year in places such as @entity47 and the @entity48			1
then the arctic blast will roll east			0
by the middle of the week , the freeze zone will sweep the @entity52 and the @entity53 , plunging lows into the single digits in @entity56 and @entity57 , among other states			2
it will cover two thirds of the country ; even parts of the @entity62 will drop down below freezing -- but just for a night or two , the @entity10 said			1
there will probably be some snow here and there , but the good news is that things should stay pretty dry , the weather service said			1
many of us will shiver			0
it wo n't be like that original " @entity23 " -- which again , was a misnomer -- which debuted in early january			1
in case you forgot : the country experienced record low temperatures and freezing pipes all the way down to @entity83 when a large frigid air mass broke free from the @entity6 and came down to visit			2
students , say goodbye to snow days meanwhile , along the @entity88 , a warm front will increase shower and thunderstorm activity in that region and the @entity93 states tuesday and into wednesday			0
" by wednesday afternoon , the front begins to push offshore again and heavier precipitation should begin to diminish			0
however , a developing surface wave along this front could clip the @entity98 with some light snows on wednesday before it moves farther out to sea , " the @entity10 said			0
for those of you in the @entity103 , you will probably not experience precipitation tuesday except for possible light snow showers in the higher terrain of the @entity106			0
wednesday , precipitation will move inland through @entity107			0
back in the cold @entity53 , well , maybe @entity108 saw this coming .			0

new : temperatures to drop 20 to 30 degrees below normal in some places
it is not a *repeat* of the " @entity23 " *monster* freeze in early january
it has the same origins , but it 's much shorter - lived
it will cover two - thirds of the *contiguous* @entity12 , the weather service says
