-- the tragedy of @entity2 is not just its staggering toll			1
it 's also the implicit racism that the deadly virus has spawned			1
the anecdotes are sickening , particularly a @entity8 report this week that children of @entity11 immigrants in @entity12 -- little ones with no connection to @entity15 , the @entity16 @entity2 patient who died wednesday in a local hospital -- have been branded " @entity2 kids " simply because of their heritage or skin color			1
in both the @entity21 and @entity22 , @entity2 is increasing racial profiling and reviving imagery of the " @entity25			1
" the disease is persistently portrayed as @entity11 , or @entity25 , or from countries in a part of the world that is racially black , even though nothing medically differentiates the vulnerability of any race to @entity2			1
a @entity34 cover last month showed a picture of a chimpanzee with the headline : " a @entity38 : smuggled bushmeat could spark a @entity21 epidemic			2
" whatever the intent , the picture was wrong			2
turns out the story was probably wrong , too , as a @entity45 investigation revealed			2
the new ebola outbreak " likely had nothing to do with bushmeat consumption , " the @entity45 reported , and there is no conclusive evidence that @entity2 has been passed from animals to humans			1
a theory on animal - to - human transmission with some limited traction centers on dead fruit bats , not chimps			2
" there is virtually no chance that ' bushmeat ' smuggling could bring @entity2 to @entity21 , " the @entity45 concluded			1
but the damage has been done			2
and as panic deepens , the danger is that racism -- on planes and public transportation , in lines , on streets , in glances -- deepens further , too			1
@entity2 is a human tragedy , just like enterovirus @entity71 , which causes sudden muscle weakness and severe respiratory problems , particularly among children			1
it has shown up in almost all the 50 states , with about 500 @entity21 infected so far , far more than ever			2
and it has begun to kill , beginning with a 4 - year - old boy in @entity78			2
five new cases were reported in @entity78 alone on tuesday			0
and there are no antiviral vaccines or cures			0
yet enterovirus @entity83 is known by a scientific name and number			0
( unfortunately for @entity25 , the ebola virus was named after the @entity89 river where the first outbreak was detected )			0
the saga of @entity15 reflects racial perceptions			1
his girlfriend , @entity93 , whom he had reportedly been visiting in @entity12 , had publicly begged for him to be given the same experimental @entity95 medication given to two ( white ) @entity21 missionaries who were infected in @entity25 and recently flown back to the @entity21			0
" i 'm just asking @entity99 and asking the @entity21 government for the same medicine they 're giving people that come from @entity16 , " she said during an interview with @entity0 's @entity98			0
" please , please , please , please , help me save his life			0
they 'll find means to get a medicine to cure him			0
" @entity93 refused to allow her last name to be used for fear of repercussions			0
unfortunately , doctors and the pharmaceutical developer said there was no longer any @entity95 left for @entity15 or any other victim			1
but the imagery that accompanied his plight lingers : whites can be flown to the @entity21 or @entity22 at any expense , while @entity25 are left to die unattended on the streets of @entity16 or @entity125			0
or now , without @entity95 , in @entity12			0
" it 's easy for the world -- the powerful world , who are largely non-african , non-people of color -- to ignore the suffering of poor , black people , " @entity127 professor @entity126 said on @entity129 's " @entity128 " last month			0
it 's easy , she said , to " other - ize " the @entity2 crisis			1
fear too often contorts morality and humanity			0

@entity2 is increasing racial profiling , says @entity145
the saga of @entity2 victim @entity15 reflects racial perceptions , @entity145 says
danger is that as panic deepens , so will racism , she says
