-- identifying the moment when a political regime begins to decompose is as difficult as dating the onset of a recession			1
but in histories of the decline of the order built by @entity9 in @entity10 , last sunday 's parliamentary election is bound to feature prominently			1
despite a campaign marred by what international observers described as " procedural violations , " " apparent manipulations , " and " serious indications of ballot - box stuffing , " the governing @entity12 party failed to prevent a sharp drop in its vote total			1
official results gave it just short of 50 % , down from 64 percent four years ago			0
almost as striking was the surge in backing for three opposition parties that until recently had seemed on their last legs			0
the @entity30 won 20 % , followed by the social democratic @entity32 party with 13 percent and @entity36 's ultra-nationalist @entity34 with 12 percent			1
@entity10 protesters , opposition leader arrested @entity9 's regime is unlikely to collapse anytime soon			1
in many countries , leaders would be delighted to control 53 % of the legislature 's seats -- the share @entity12 will receive after parties that failed to reach the 7 % threshold are eliminated			1
but the election makes it official : the downward slide has begun			2
all previous ballots saw @entity12 increase its vote			0
the party held 70 % of the seats in the last @entity54 , enough to change the constitution at will			0
speaking as results came in , a chastened president @entity56 even uttered the dreaded word " coalition			0
" personally , @entity9 still enjoys the approval of 67 % of @entity10			1
but his ratings , too , have been slipping			0
his peak -- 87 % approval -- came , oddly enough , in december 2007 , the month of the last parliamentary ballot			2
his negatives are also rising , with one - third of @entity10 now disapproving of his performance and 53 % faulting that of the government he leads			1
some members of the disaffected third were evidently among the sports fans at a martial arts fight last month who booed and jeered after @entity9 stepped into the ring to congratulate the winner			1
for @entity9 , himself a judo black belt , it was an unprecedented humiliation			1
the souring mood has two main causes			0
first , the regime 's popularity has always rested on the buoyant economy of the oil boom years			1
from 2000 to 2008 , @entity10 ' real disposable income rose by more than 10 % a year on average			1
the global financial crisis put an end to that			0
last year , massive government spending on pensions and public - sector wages boosted incomes by a little more than 4 %			0
but so far this year , disposable income has fallen			0
@entity9 's appeal has also been eroded by the relentless accumulation of aggravations : bribe - grubbing traffic police , officials who can not put out forest fires or prevent terrorist attacks , a deranged cop who shoots customers in a @entity104 supermarket , and the violence of @entity106 , now spreading across the @entity107			1
these and dozens of similar irritations are heightened by the tin - eared self - congratulation of official pronouncements			0
@entity9 's victory in next march 's presidential election remains all but assured			1
but the last two times he ran , in 2000 and 2004 , three months before the vote his ratings were respectively 79 and 81 % , far above their current level			0
this may be the hardest fight he has faced			0
whatever else they reveal , sunday 's results undercut the image , common in the @entity123 , of @entity9 's regime as an effective authoritarian state			1
in fact , it is a regime that can not even steal an election decisively			2
a massive effort , involving shameless pressures on voters and manipulation of the rules , apparently only managed to improve @entity12 's total by a few percentage points			2
two exit polls put the party 's vote at 46 % and 49 %			2
the respected @entity139 , no stooge of the @entity141 , forecast a result of 51 % , which was higher than the officially announced total			0
rather than a classic authoritarian government , @entity9 's is a peculiar hybrid that has combined genuine popularity with counterproductive attempts to over-manage and eliminate all potential threats			1
continually centralizing power , the @entity141 has progressively lost control			2
barring a return to rapid growth , it is not clear how @entity9 and @entity56 can reverse the slide			1
they will hear conflicting arguments			0
some will urge them to reach out to the middle class with a new package of liberal reforms			0
yet , unless they suddenly become willing to genuinely share power , this probably will not buy them much support			1
four years of @entity56 's tweets about modernization and rule of law have inoculated the elites against empty @entity141 promises			2
at the same time , the elections hardly revealed a hunger for liberal economics or even @entity176 - style democracy			2
the @entity178 party , made up of unimpeachable democrats and civic activists , won just 3 % of the votes			0
another option is to woo the masses with additional bursts of populist spending , at least until the presidential vote is over			0
yet with the budget already swelled by anti-crisis measures , such a strategy is dangerous			0
the long - serving finance minister , @entity190 , was fired last september after publicly criticizing @entity56 's plans to increase military expenditures			2
a third possibility is for @entity9 to trade in his soft authoritarianism for a tougher , more effective model			1
yet , even if he wanted to do this , it is doubtful that he has the kind of skilled and ruthless apparatus that could make it work			2
it is hard to think of extremely repressive regimes that have succeeded in societies as economically developed , highly educated , and rich in communications technology as @entity10 's is today			1
paradoxical as it might sound , authoritarianism in relatively modern countries relies on a significant degree of consent			0
that leaves the most likely outcome a continuing downward slide , perhaps temporarily slowed by improved economic performance or accelerated by striking government failures and scandals			0
the turbulence is just beginning			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			1

@entity217 : @entity10 elections may mark beginning of @entity9 's regime decline
@entity9 's in power , he writes , but even ballot stuffing failed to stop the slide
@entity217 : decline tied to worsening economy , *dysfunctional* police , @entity106
@entity9 must share power or soften his image , he says . repression wo *n't* work
