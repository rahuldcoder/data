" to see this kind of activity happening in our ranks is really heart - wrenching and sickening			1
" @entity21 spoke generally about sex abuse crimes in the military			0
@entity1 investigates trend in military sexual assaults " as i said to our new brigadier general corps when i spoke to them about two weeks ago , ' you can do everything from this point forward in your military career perfectly , but if you fail on this , you have failed the @entity1 ' , " he reportedly said			2
the solider was assigned as a @entity48 and @entity49 program coordinator when the allegations surfaced			1
" there is a distinct possibility , " that some sort of prostitution - related activity was involved , an administration official told @entity0			1
but investigators have not yet determined the scope of that possibility or the potential criminal misconduct			0

he met with @entity21 and directed him to ensure that " all of those who might be involved are dealt with appropriately , " according to @entity65 spokesman @entity64			2

the @entity115 @entity114 has a granddaughter in the @entity1			0
" i see no meaningful distinction between complacency or complicity in the military 's latest failure to uphold their own standards of conduct			1
nor do i see a distinction between the service member who orchestrated this offense and the chain of command that was either oblivious to or tolerant of criminal behavior , " he said			1
military rape victims : stop blaming us the allegations of abuse come soon after an air force officer was charged with sexual battery stemming from an incident in @entity137			2
lt. col. @entity138 , a 1994 graduate of the @entity139 who served tours in both @entity141 and @entity142 , was arrested this month and accused of grabbing a woman 's buttocks and breasts in a parking lot in @entity147 not far from the @entity65			0

" we have the best and the brightest serving in our military			0
we have the greatest military in the world			0
and we ask everything of them			0
we ask them to even die for their country			0
