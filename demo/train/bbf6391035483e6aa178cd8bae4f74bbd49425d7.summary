the successor to @entity2 's troubled @entity1 may be on the way			1
@entity4 , the man who created @entity2 classics such as " @entity6 " and " @entity7 , " says the @entity9 gaming giant is at work on a new gaming console			1
" for the time being , our focus is on the @entity1 hardware , but @entity2 as a whole has groups working on ideas for new hardware systems , " he said , via a translator , in an interview with the @entity14			1
" while we 're busy working on software for the @entity1 , we have production lines that are working on ideas for what the next system might be			2
" ' @entity28 , ' ' @entity7 ' creator says give the @entity1 time one of the most iconic names in video gaming , @entity2 dominated the market with its @entity1 console , which sold more than 100 million units after its release in 2006			1
but the follow - up , @entity1 , with its handheld second - screen controller , failed to make a similar splash			0
the company lost more than $ 15 million in the final nine months of 2013 , largely due to disappointing sales numbers for the @entity44 sales forecast of 9 million @entity1 units in 2013 , the console 's first full year , was slashed to a mere 2.8 million			1
this year has seen a slight uptick in sales , with the release of popular titles such as " @entity50 " and " @entity51			0
" but the console still trails the rival @entity53 and @entity55 badly in popularity			0
things got so bad that there was speculation @entity2 would abandon hardware entirely , instead focusing on developing popular franchises such as @entity28 and @entity7 for other consoles			1
in the @entity14 interview , @entity4 focused on more positive recent news for the company			2
released in october , " @entity73 " has joined the new " @entity50 " title as a hot seller as have " amiibos , " action figures of popular @entity2 characters that can both be collected and used in conjunction with some video games			0
and there have been reports , via the @entity77 email hack , that a " @entity79 " feature film may be in the works			0
while the @entity1 was released a year earlier than last year 's @entity83 and @entity55 updates , it 's unlikely gamers will see a new @entity1 in 2015			0
several major software releases for the @entity1 , including new " @entity86 " and " @entity7 " titles , already have been announced for the coming year , making it unlikely the company would compete with itself with new hardware .			2
