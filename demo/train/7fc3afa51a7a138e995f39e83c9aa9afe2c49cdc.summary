@entity0 -- recent remarks from a @entity5 justice have alarmed those still pushing for an @entity7 to the @entity8 , three decades after an earlier attempt failed			1
congressional supporters of such an amendment say there 's now some urgency to include the concept of equality in the document after justice @entity16 was quoted as saying " nobody ever voted for that			2
" a 1972 proposal fell short of ratification by three states before its 1982 deadline			1
@entity16 , in last month 's issue of @entity24 , said that if " society wants to outlaw discrimination by sex , hey , we have things called legislatures			1
" lawmakers responded thursday on the @entity32 of the @entity33 , across from the @entity5			0
" today , while the @entity37 is reading the @entity8 , we are here to point out what is so troubling about what @entity16 believes , " said rep. @entity34 , @entity36 - @entity35			1
if @entity16 's view spreads to a high court majority , @entity40 said , it " could overturn all of our body of work to protect the rights of women			1
" the key @entity48 supporter , @entity49 democrat @entity47 , said three - fourths of @entity50 assume the @entity7 is already part of the @entity8 -- but because the measure has never been ratified by the states , " the courts might not guarantee it , " he said			1
@entity47 underscored the need to take action , based on the @entity5 's ruling in last year 's @entity59 case against business			0
he said the justices " would elevate a corporate entity to have the rights of an individual , and yet say that women do not have rights as an individual under the @entity8			2
" @entity16 's remarks date to september , during an interview with a @entity72 law professor			0
he is quoted as saying , " certainly the @entity8 does not require discrimination on the basis of sex			2
the only issue is whether it prohibits it			0
" @entity40 said many women 's groups have acted as if prevailing law and practices are enough to assume women have equal rights , but she noted that several prominent groups now have fresh concern			1
" we have waited far too long , " said @entity88 of the @entity89			0
" we 've got to make sure it 's explicit in the @entity8			0
" @entity92 , president of the @entity93 , held up a pocket copy of the @entity8 and read part of the 14th amendment , saying " nor shall any state deprive any person of equal rights under the law			0
" " a man in power like @entity16 insists that the word person in the 14th @entity7 does n't apply to half the population of the @entity50 , " she said			2
lawmakers who passed the 1972 proposal extended a seven - year deadline to 1982 , yet ratification stalled at 35 out of the needed 38 states			1
supporters believe the 35 ratifications could be kept alive by @entity114 if and when another three states endorse that 1972 proposal			2
" the three - state strategy was developed following ratification of the @entity8 's 27th amendment in 1992 , more than 203 years after its passage by @entity114 in 1789 , " notes the website www.equalrightsamendment.org			0
the 27th @entity7 blocks lawmakers from voting themselves a pay raise to take effect during the same session of @entity114 in which it was passed .			0

@entity16 says the @entity8 does not prohibit discrimination by sex
the @entity7 was first proposed in 1923 , but a 1972 proposal was not ratified
