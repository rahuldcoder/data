editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- whenever someone at our office bitches about being overworked , our stock response is " beats digging ditches			1
" while the express intention of the statement is usually not - so - supportive , we think it 's a healthy reminder that at the end of the day , we are all basically professional e-mailers and should be thankful for such			1
the wildland firefighters who work for @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , have no such motivational adages because their job is actually digging ditches			1
on the sides of mountains			1
you ca n't even bitch at these guys for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older , because they 're all private - sector contractors			2
which means if they are n't out fighting forest fires or doing preventative forestry on unburned woods ( basically extreme landscaping ) , they are losing money			0
they are the hardest working men in the tree business			2
@entity30 in the summer is a tinderbox			0
last year the state recorded some 560 wild fires , the majority of which occurred in the seemingly endless sea of trees running across its bottom from the @entity61 to the @entity62			0
humidity is next to nonexistent , which is extremely pleasant , but means that even an errant spark from a chainsaw or the proverbial cigarette butt out the car window can set the entire region ablaze			0
flying into the @entity71 , there is evidence of past wild fires is everywhere : from the miles - long scar of the 2002 " biscuit " fire stretching past the horizon , to the smaller pockets of charred trees crowding the edge of towns to the blue wilderness - firefighter - ribbon bumper stickers flying past on the @entity84 to the elaborate wildfire and firefighter shrines at a local bar			2
see more of @entity88 at @entity9 there are very few places firemen are n't revered as local heroes , but the wilderness firefighters of @entity30 go past people simply risking their lives to help others into a crazy superhero realm where their work regularly prevents entire settlements from being destroyed			1
they 're literally the guardians of their communities			0
incidentally , their work is also very beneficial for the forest			2
we spent a few days following a crew of @entity28 forest - firefighters walk up the sides of what most people would consider a cliff , to chop down underbrush in preparation for a controlled burn			1
this is what they like to call " project work " -- the light stuff they do between fires			0
the work is the hardest and least rewarding work we have ever tried to do			1
unless you consider 12 - hour - plus shifts of backbreaking labor , virtually zero outside recognition , and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards			1

@entity9 follows firefighters as they prepare for a controlled burn
12 - hour shifts involve ditch digging , brush clearing in mountains
@entity9 crew calls it " the hardest and least rewarding work we have ever tried to do "
