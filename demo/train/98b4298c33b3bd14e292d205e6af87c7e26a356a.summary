editor 's note : @entity2 is @entity4 professor of law at @entity5 and co-author of " on reading the @entity8 , " and the author of " no litmus test : @entity11 in the @entity12			1
" a former law clerk for @entity16 @entity15 , he blogs at @entity17			1
@entity2 says judges have a big leg up in dealing with complex @entity16 issues			1
( @entity21 ) -- with the nomination of @entity24 to the @entity16 , president @entity22 has hit the trifecta : as a summa cum laude graduate of @entity27 and an editor of the @entity29 , @entity24 clearly has the intellectual chops to handle the work of the high court			1
born and raised in a @entity35 family in the @entity36 , @entity24 's personal story is an inspiring tale of personal achievement			1
and as someone originally appointed to the federal district court by the first president @entity41 , she will be perceived as , and in fact is , a moderate liberal who should easily win confirmation by a @entity46 @entity45			0
the nomination will nonetheless disappoint some critics who worry that every justice , including @entity24 , if confirmed , will have come directly from the federal appellate bench			1
none of the current justices has ever held any major elective office			0
yet former politicians have served with distinction on the @entity16			1
@entity56 was a state legislator			0
@entity57 was a @entity58 senator			0
@entity59 and @entity60 were governors			0
and @entity62 was president before becoming chief justice			0
it is not difficult to see why political experience would be very valuable for a @entity16 justice			2
the issues with which the court deals frequently have political ramifications , and some legal tests incorporate elements of public opinion			0
for example , in determining whether some punishment is constitutionally barred as " cruel and unusual , " the justices ask whether it comports with society 's " evolving standards of decency			2
" experience going before the people in an election would be useful in gauging public values			0
accordingly , presidents in recent years have sometimes flirted with the idea of naming a politician to the @entity16			2
president @entity86 was prepared to nominate former @entity88 gov. @entity87			0
@entity89 was not an elected official , but her experience in politics appealed to president @entity41 , until her nomination was scuttled by questions about her qualifications and ideology			0
@entity22 was rumored to have considered @entity99 gov. @entity98 for justice @entity101 's seat			1
in the end , however , every vacancy on the court since @entity56 's appointment in 1981 has been filled by a sitting federal appellate judge			1
why ? part of the answer is that a federal appeals court judge has already been confirmed by the @entity45 once , and so is unlikely to have skeletons in the closet			2
but the deeper reason may be that so much of the work of the @entity16 is extremely technical			1
consider a case decided earlier this month involving allegations by taxpayers that their tax consultants had given them faulty advice , thereby subjecting them to penalties owed to the @entity121			0
as the case reached the @entity16 , the issue presented was this : " @entity125 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the @entity126 confer appellate jurisdiction over an appeal from a motion to stay proceedings under @entity131 of the @entity126 when appellants are non-signatories to the arbitration agreement ? " serving as an elected official is unlikely to prepare someone even to understand , much less provide an informed answer to , that sort of question			1
questions of the sort just described make up more than half of the work of the @entity16			1
to say that they are " technical " is not to say that they do not involve real people or that they lack any political overtones			0
for example , just today , the court divided 5 - 4 along ideological lines over the seemingly technical question of whether a state law that barred state court jurisdiction over certain categories of cases could also be applied to bar a lawsuit arising under federal law			0
the ideological split no doubt resulted from the fact that the liberal justices , who gained a majority in the case , are more sympathetic to civil rights lawsuits than the conservative justices are			0
but without a thorough grounding in the minutiae of the law governing jurisdiction , a justice would not even know where to begin in such a case , regardless of his or her values			0
thus , @entity22 's statement that he would look for @entity16 nominees with empathy for their fellow human beings must be understood in context			1
the president never said that empathy was a sufficient quality for a @entity16 justice			2
rather , the ability to understand the human consequences of decisions about seemingly technical legal questions enables a judge to achieve justice within the framework of the law , but only if he or she first has a thorough grasp of that framework			2
that prior step of technical expertise is itself essential			2
it is possible for a legally trained politician to get up to speed on the law 's technical dimensions and serve as a competent or even great @entity16 justice			1
but if one is looking for a predictor , nothing beats distinguished service on a federal appeals court			0
when one adds to that @entity24 's compelling story and her work as a prosecutor , private practice lawyer and trial judge , it is easy to see why the president decided that his best choice for this appointment was to think " inside the box			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity24 pick is strong on personal , professional grounds
he says some had hoped @entity22 would pick someone not an appellate judge
@entity2 : the @entity16 's work has gotten so technical , it requires expertise
