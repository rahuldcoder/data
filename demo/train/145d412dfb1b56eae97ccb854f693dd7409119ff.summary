-- @entity2 president @entity1 claims that goal - line technology is not needed in soccer , stating it would lead to " @entity7 football			1
" world governing body @entity8 will test possible goal - line systems in the coming months after reversing its stance on the widely - debated issue , but the head of the sport in @entity14 is not in favor of the prospective changes			1
when asked about the potential use of goal - line technology during a visit to the city of @entity22 , the @entity17 referred to the popular video - game console when he told the @entity25 website : " then we will have @entity7 football			1
" @entity1 , one of the world 's top footballers during the 1980s , believes more help should instead be offered to referees , highlighting the use of two extra match officials in this season 's @entity33 as a better way forward			2
" the referee has to be helped by clubs , fans , players , media and authorities , " @entity1 said on monday			2
" it is why we have added two assistants for @entity46 games			0
" one referee is not enough , not in the modern era where you have 20 cameras			0
" the 55 - year - old also said the high media presence at modern - day games does not help match officials , with television cameras able to instantly see when mistakes have been made by referees			2
" it is unfair -- the cameras can see everything but the referee only has one pair of eyes			0
every time he makes a mistake , those cameras are there to focus on it			0
" it is why for the past 10 years i have asked to change the job of the referee , to help improve the situation and to give the referees better support			0
" the subject of goal - line technology has long been hotly - debated within football , and the issue came to the fore once again at the @entity79 in @entity80 when @entity82 's @entity81 had a goal not given against @entity84 despite the ball crossing the line .			1

@entity1 questions plans to *experiment* with goal - line technology
the head of @entity14 ruling body @entity2 believes it would lead to " @entity7 football "
the @entity17 instead backs the use of extra officials in matches to help referees
he says high media presence at football matches makes it more *difficult* for officials
