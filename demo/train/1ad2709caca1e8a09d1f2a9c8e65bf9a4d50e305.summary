-- on august 24 , a jury of nine in a @entity3 federal court handed down a ruling that sent shockwaves through the global wireless phone industry			1
@entity7 , the world 's largest phone maker , was found guilty of infringing on key @entity11 hardware design and software elements			0
@entity7 got @entity11 's attention because of its size , but every @entity15 device manufacturer now needs to consider potential exposure areas that could put them in the crosshairs as @entity11 tries to slow @entity15 growth			1
the appeals game will surely play out over the next many months			0
in the meantime , consumers will feel the pain as devices potentially get more expensive and software changes begin to creep into their @entity15 smartphones			2
if appeals rulings uphold the initial verdict , the mobile ecosystem as we know it will look very different in one to two years			2
this would be driven by fundamental changes in the look and feel of non-apple phone hardware , changes to the @entity15 mobile operating system and potentially the emergence of a third popular mobile operating system			1
smartphone market changes coming @entity15 phones account for 56 % of the @entity44 smartphone market			1
friday 's ruling was very sobering for the @entity15 device manufacturers that have driven this growth			1
until recently , smartphone design patent ownership seemed like a gray area			2
the court has now made it clear that , in fact , it is very black and white			0
all phone manufacturers will need to be a lot more careful from here on out when it comes to design , and patents they want to avoid , license or partner on			2
this could result in phones being more expensive for consumers			0
over the next year , consumers lose in this equation			0
@entity15 phone makers will be scrambling to develop temporary workarounds to steer clear of any potentially infringing @entity11 patents			1
the time spent working on these fixes will reduce time spent on development of new , innovative features			2
in the case of @entity7 , it is likely the only device manufacturer with the resources and scale to develop and implement fixes rapidly , mitigating the immediate impact on consumers			0
if there are other phone makers in @entity11 's sights , they will be taking advantage of a much - needed head start to begin developing workarounds now to avoid a lawsuit			1
sure , @entity15 consumers could always turn to @entity11 , but some are turned off by the company 's one phone per year release schedule and continued hesitancy to incorporate the latest mobile advances such as @entity96 and larger screens			1
consumers who want to stay in the open and highly - customizable @entity15 ecosystem could experience some temporary frustration			1
creating the next iconic device this ruling could prove to be the catalyst for major industry change			0
smartphone product roadmaps are all but decided for the next year			0
beyond that , every device manufacturer will be thinking outside of the " rectangular slab form - factor " box in an attempt to create the next big consumer trend			1
this will be easier said than done given that consumers have become accustomed to the current crop of devices			0
device manufacturers know that consumers ca n't tell them what they want , they can only tell them what they do n't want			0
this will result in phone makers traveling into unchartered territory in the hopes of capturing consumer attention and emotion			1
choice will likely also come in the way of new mobile operating system platforms			0
it is no coincidence that @entity129 and @entity130 's stock opened higher the day after the ruling			2
@entity11 stated during the trial that these companies have proven that it is possible to innovate in the smartphone market without copying @entity11			0
of course , @entity11 does have patent and design agreements with @entity129 and both companies have a mutual interest in slowing @entity15 growth			1
as wireless carriers and device manufacturers seek to diversify their product lineup in the wake of the ruling , @entity129 might finally have its day in mobile			1
it is very likely that we 'll eventually see a three horse mobile operating system race among @entity11 , @entity15 and @entity129			1
short term is not pretty , but long term looks good the short - term might not be pretty , but long - term , the industry is poised to break free from the homogenous rounded rectangular slabs with grid - based apps we 're all familiar with today			1
this ruling will encourage accelerated innovation from device manufacturers , which will move beyond the constraints of a single form factor			2
ultimately , the consumer will choose what designs will win and which implementation of hardware and software integration is most elegant			0
today 's constraints will define how the industry will innovate tomorrow			0
it might be a tough road , but there are promising days ahead			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			0

in the short term , the @entity3 verdict could raise smartphone *prices* and development time
@entity15 phone makers will scramble to steer clear of potential patent infringements
manufacturers will be thinking outside of the " rectangular slab form - factor " box
as manufacturers diversify , @entity129 might finally have its day in the mobile *sun*
