-- just a few years ago , not many people would believe that an independent film director would be put in charge of resurrecting one of the most popular superheroes of all time on the big screen			1
yet @entity7 , best known for " ( 500 ) @entity8 , " rebooted " @entity9 " on the big screen : a gamble which paid off to the tune of $ 262 million in the @entity12 this past summer			1
with @entity13 already rumored to play the villain @entity15 in the 2014 sequel , @entity7 spoke to @entity0 about the experience making the hit movie ( out on blu - ray this friday ) , and looked ahead to the next installment			1
( if you have n't seen the movie , be forewarned there are spoilers ahead			2
) @entity0 : now that you 've had a little time to the reflect , what surprised you most about the reaction ? @entity7 : we did a big press tour around the world and it was extraordinary to see the level of enthusiasm			1
in @entity35 , @entity36 and everywhere else , it 's staggering the pervasiveness of @entity9			1
people reacted well to the @entity39 ( @entity40 ) and @entity41 ( @entity41 ) storyline			1
more than action , spectacle , superheroes or anything else , what goes on between two people in a room , whether it 's anger or love or sometimes both is important			1
creating a relatable , emotional space with the characters was crucial			2
that breakup scene -- @entity57 and @entity58 were really great in that			2
i have to take my hat off to those actors for that			2
what was fun was how curious people were about @entity39 's parents			1
the long shadow of that mystery was cast over the film			2
it was really encouraging that that gamble paid off			0
even though we did n't quite solve it			0
@entity0 : what was your favorite reaction to the film ? @entity7 : in @entity80 people were really moved by the crane moment			1
they felt inspired by people coming together			2
it was nice that it came across			0
it came across stronger in @entity80 than @entity86			1
different parts of the world reacted differently to different things			0
@entity0 : what was the most difficult thing to pull off ? @entity7 : you realize how many fans are in that universe			1
the intensity of the fans was really overwhelming for me , and also inspiring , but also intimidating			0
you understand their love of the characters and you want to make them happy , but you want to surprise them as well			0
when i did " summer , " nobody cared			0
i was desperate for some publicity			0
with this there was too much publicity and too many websites talking about our movie			0
you want to make a movie in private to create and experiment but that 's not the way of a big franchise			0
you want to create performances as great as any independent film , it 's not about big or small			2
it 's about finding something special			0
@entity0 : would you ideally hope that this becomes a trilogy ? @entity7 : that 's too far in the future , but i 'm having a great time			1
i 'm having a really great time			0
@entity0 : what themes do you want to explore more in the next movie ? what should @entity129 and @entity130 viewers look for in preparing for the sequel ? @entity7 : there 's a lot more to explore with the parents			1
the @entity41 saga is going to unfold in an interesting way			0
@entity0 : you and @entity139 were confirmed for the sequel			0
is @entity141 likely to return as well ? @entity7 : @entity58 will be back			1
