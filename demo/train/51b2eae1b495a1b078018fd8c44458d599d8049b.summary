-- social media users who denounce drug cartel activities along the @entity5 border received a brutal warning this week : two mangled bodies hanging like cuts of meat from a pedestrian bridge			1
a woman was hogtied and disemboweled , her intestines protruding from three deep cuts on her abdomen			2
attackers left her topless , dangling by her feet and hands from a bridge in the border city of @entity21			2
a bloodied man next to her was hanging by his hands , his right shoulder severed so deeply the bone was visible			2
signs left near the bodies declared the pair , both apparently in their early 20s , were killed for posting denouncements of drug cartel activities on a social network			1
" this is going to happen to all of those posting funny things on the @entity37 , " one sign said			2
" you better ( expletive ) pay attention			0
i 'm about to get you			0
" the gruesome scene sent a chilling message at a time when online posts have become some of the loudest voices reporting violence in @entity5			1
in some parts of the country , threats from cartels have silenced traditional media			1
sometimes even local authorities fear speaking out			0
@entity5 's notoriously ruthless drug gangs regularly hang victims from bridges and highway overpasses			1
and bloggers who specialize in sharing news about trafficking have been threatened in the past			0
but this could be the first time users of such social networks have been targeted			1
investigator @entity65 said he had not encountered a threat against @entity37 users in his four years based in @entity21			1
but the signs of torture -- the cuts , the disembowelment -- were along the lines of what officials are used to seeing in drug - related violence			1
in the case of the two victims found on the @entity21 bridge tuesday , their ears and fingers were mutilated , said @entity82 , who works for the public prosecutor 's office			0
there are no witnesses , and it is a nearly impossible task to identify the perpetrators , he said			0
thirty - six hours had passed since the bodies were found tuesday morning , but no one had come to claim them and they remained unidentified , @entity82 said			1
it will be nearly impossible to determine if the two victims actually posted anything about cartels on the @entity37 , as people do n't usually use their real names online , he said			1
the placards threatened those who report violent incidents through social media networks			1
it listed two blogs by name , @entity105 and @entity106			0
they were signed " z , " a possible reference for the @entity111 cartel , which operates in the area			2
@entity106 is a website that deals exclusively with news related to drug violence in @entity5			1
on the @entity105 forum , where citizens can make anonymous tips , one person wrote : " do n't be afraid to denounce			0
it 's very difficult for them to find out who denounced			0
they only want to scare society			0
" one @entity127 user echoed that sense of defiance in light of the threats			0
" enough ! if we shut up today , we will have lost the ground that we have gained			0
this is the time to show what we are made of , " the owner of the @ @entity127 account wrote			2
in a statement sent to @entity0 , @entity106 said its site is not dedicated to denouncing crime , as are other sites			2
" in addition , we are not in favor or against any criminal group , we only inform as things happen , " the statement said			0
more than 34,600 people have died in drug - related violence since @entity5 president @entity148 announced a crackdown on cartels in december 2006 , according to government statistics			1
other reports have listed a higher toll			0
the latest @entity5 government tally was released in january			1
