-- the lawyer that helped revolutionize the way football 's transfer system works has turned his sights on @entity8 's new system of financial regulation			1
@entity10 , who helped @entity12 footballer @entity11 change @entity14 law in 1995 to allow players to move for free at the end of their contract , is representing a @entity12 licensed agent who has lodged a complaint with the @entity20 over @entity8 's @entity21 ( @entity21 ) rules			1
this season is the first since the rules were introduced and they will come more fully into force in 2014			0
they give @entity8 sweeping powers , including exclusion from the lucrative @entity30 , to punish financially recalcitrant clubs			0
the regulations are designed to prevent big spending clubs spending beyond their means and posting unsustainable yearly losses			0
however the complaint argues @entity8 's " break - even rule " restricts competition -- a key principle of @entity39 -- and will reduce the number of transfers			1
that could potentially lower players ' salaries -- and by implication agents ' fees -- prompting @entity12 agent @entity43 to lodge the complaint with the @entity20			1
unlike " super agent " @entity50 , who represents @entity52 coach @entity51 and forward @entity53 , @entity43 specialises in looking after the interests of a number of young players entering the professional game			0
his two most high - profile players are @entity59 at @entity60 in @entity61 and @entity62 at @entity12 club @entity63			2
" the " break - even " rule also infringes other @entity66 fundamental freedoms : free movement of capital ( as far as club owners are concerned ) , free movement of workers ( players ) and free movement of services ( player agents ) , " said the statement issued by @entity43 and @entity77			1
however @entity8 expects the @entity20 to reject the complaint given the support it has received from a number of @entity14 bodies as well as clubs ahead of the new regulations ' introduction			2
" the @entity20 , the @entity87 , the @entity14 clubs , leagues and players ' union have all been fully supportive of @entity21 and have on many occasions commented positively on this @entity8 initiative , " said the @entity14 governing body in a statement to @entity0			1
" as is well known , the @entity8 rules encourage clubs to ' live within their own means ' , which is a sound economic principle aiming to guarantee the long - term sustainability and viability of @entity14 football			2
" @entity8 believes that @entity21 is fully in line with @entity66 law and is confident that the @entity20 will reject this complaint			1
" in december , @entity101 were handed a season - long ban from @entity8 club competitions after falling foul of @entity21			1
any ban would come into place over any of the next four seasons should they qualify to play in @entity8			0
@entity101 , who were the first high - profile club to be punished under new tougher @entity21 rules , owed player wages and have debts with other football sides as well as the @entity115 tax authorities , claim @entity8			1
however the @entity115 club have lodged an appeal with the @entity118 against @entity8 's decision with a hearing set for may 14 and decision expected sometime in june			2
" it is important to note this complaint does not at all question the legality of the @entity8 rule ( also included in the @entity21 regulations ) that states that any club participating in the @entity8 competition must prove -- before the start of the competition -- that it has no overdue payables towards clubs , players and social / tax authorities , " said the @entity43 and @entity77 statement			1
" in our view , this rule is justified in principle for the attainment of the integrity of the football competition and proportionate to this objective			0
" @entity43 contacted compatriot @entity10 , who is based in @entity143 , after the @entity12 lawyer wrote in the @entity145 about his opposition to @entity21 in march			2
" some of @entity8 's biggest clubs are , unsurprisingly , the loudest supporters of rules that entrench their dominance , " wrote @entity10 in march			2
" the time is right for a strong reminder from the @entity66 's antitrust authorities that football , like any other multi billion - euro industry , must comply with the law			0
" @entity10 added that in a letter dated march 12 , 2012 , competition chief @entity157 had wrote to @entity8 president @entity159 to say that he welcomed the " break - even rule " , stating that " this principle is also consistent with the aims and objectives of @entity66 policy in the field of state aid			1
" the @entity20 must now decide whether to uphold or reject the complaint from @entity43 and @entity10			0
if the complaint is rejected , the @entity12 agent and lawyer could then appeal to the @entity170			1
the process could take between one and three years			0
" any person or party -- as the @entity178 or the @entity179 or individual clubs -- who can prove an interest in the outcome of a case may apply to join into in the proceedings , " said lawyer @entity172 of @entity175 firm @entity173			0
" it sounds like there will be a lot of potentially " interested " parties for this one , " added @entity172			0
" if they all try to get involved the proceeding could be delayed even longer .			0
