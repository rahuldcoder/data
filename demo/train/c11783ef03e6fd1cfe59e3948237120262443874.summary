-- @entity1 and @entity2 have pulled out of the @entity3 due to conflict over proposals for cost cutting in the elite motorsport			1
the umbrella group was formed at @entity2 's @entity10 base in 2008 to help the teams protect their interests in talks with ruling body the @entity16 and @entity17 's rights holders			1
while the @entity20 marque 's president @entity18 was the initial leader of @entity3 , since late 2009 it has been headed by @entity22 chief @entity21			0
@entity23 left @entity3 at the end of the team 's first season in 2010 , and the latest defections mean that nine of the 12 teams on the grid are part of the group			1
@entity33 retains @entity35 drive for 2012 " @entity3 , like the rest of the world , is currently going through a delicate period			0
@entity2 wants to work with all parties for the future of a sport that expresses the highest level of motorsport technology , " the 31 - time world champions said in a statement on friday			1
" we must return to a situation where @entity17 is really a test bed for advanced technological research , the results of which can be transferred to @entity52 cars			2
in addition , we must not forget that this sport must become more user - friendly and more accessible to the general public			0
" furthermore , it can not be the only professional sport where it is practically impossible to do any training : the number of days of testing must be increased so that the drivers , especially the young ones who lack experience and the teams , can be adequately prepared , as well as providing more opportunities for them to come into contact with spectators and sponsors			0
" @entity1 have dominated @entity17 in the past two years , winning the constructors ' title twice as @entity72 became the sport 's youngest double world champion			1
" @entity1 can confirm it has served notice to withdraw from @entity3 , " the @entity77 - based @entity76 outfit said in a statement on friday			1
" the team will remain committed to finding a solution regarding cost saving in @entity3			0
" @entity2 -- whose last world title was the 2008 constructors ' crown -- will also continue to work within @entity17 's @entity87 , which aims to control costs			1
" it was a difficult decision and a great deal of thought went into it			0
it was taken reluctantly after analyzing the current situation and the stalemate when it came to debate on some issues that were at the core of why the association was formed , " the team said			0
" some of the major achievements of the association during these years , also worked out in conjunction with the @entity16 , centered around cost reduction , which was of significant benefit to everyone , the big teams and the small ones			2
" @entity2 was on the front line in this area , even before the birth of @entity3 , and it intends to continue down this route to ensure the sustainability of the sport in the long term			2
" now however , it is necessary to find some new impetus to move it along because @entity3 's drive has run its course , despite the excellent work of current president @entity21 in trying to reach agreement between the various positions for the common good			0

world champion marques withdraw from the @entity17 teams association
