-- " @entity1 " is a film of first - time triumphs : it 's writer / director @entity7 's first feature , and the first acting roles for two of its stars , @entity9 and @entity12			1
the movie follows @entity14 , a father struggling with illness who tries to impart valuable survival skills to his daughter , @entity1 ( @entity9 ) , as a storm disrupts their life in a sheltered community called the bathtub on the @entity24 @entity23			1
@entity12 's performance is raw , unsettling and powerful and all the more remarkable for someone new to acting			1
@entity9 , 8 , also turns in a phenomenal performance in her debut			1
following a limited opening in @entity31 and @entity32 last month , " beasts " has received nearly universal critical acclaim , becoming one of the summer 's most - talked about films			1
it 's carving out space in between superhero flicks and " @entity40 , " the movie about the stuffed talking bear , as it expands into theaters across the country			1
@entity12 , 45 , a baker ( and the owner of the @entity46 in @entity47 ) , will tell you in his cool , @entity50 drawl that he 's taking everything in stride			1
but after the film won the @entity57 's grand jury prize , the @entity54 doors have opened up			1
@entity12 just wrapped his second film , " @entity58 , " working alongside director @entity59 and actors @entity60 and @entity62			1
@entity0 spoke to the baker / actor from @entity32 about his new career on the big screen as well as some theories as to the success of " @entity1			1
" @entity0 : growing up , what types of movies were you into ? @entity12 : i liked the westerns			1

@entity0 : i read that you turned down the role of @entity14 three times			1
@entity12 : reluctantly , i turned it down			1
not turned it down like snubbing my nose turning it down			2
i was obligated to my business ; it had just opened up , and it was hard to leave			2
but it was what they seen in me ... they had me believing that i was the only person who could do this part			2
after i turned them down , reluctantly , three times , they really convinced me that no one could do this part but me			2
they had so much belief to put their whole film , millions of dollars , into my hands			1
when i finally took the part , i remember all three of the producers came into the bakery , the accountants came in with them and they were like , " you got ta do this			1
" they seen something in me			2
i worked things out with my partners and moved out of town			2
i just finished shooting another film , " twelve years a slave			1
" @entity59 directed the movie			2

@entity0 : what was the first day on the " beasts " set like ? were you nervous ? @entity12 : not really			1
i 'm not the type of person			2
... i would n't say i was nervous			0
it was something new to me -- cameras on me , people watching me			0
i 'm more the type of person that accepts challenges , and i believe in myself because i would n't have the success i 've had in business without believing in myself			0
@entity0 : the film takes place in a very specific place , within a very specific culture , after an event we all recognize as a significant storm			1
@entity12 : you have to be from down there to relate to some of the difficulties and challenges that we face , living on the @entity23 , in that region			1
there ( are ) particular parts to that region that are protected to a level where they can always recover , but there ( are ) parts of that region that are forgotten about , unprotected			0
@entity0 : in the course of your life in @entity47 , you must 've come across people who were very similar to the characters in " @entity177			1
i know some resilient people			0
resilient people meaning under the worse circumstances in the world , they wo n't leave the things they love			0
we often have to go through that			0
just like that last situation we had with @entity186			0
a lot of people refused to leave			0
we 're not just going to walk away from these things			0
i stood back , i was in neck - high water and got stranded down there and had to run for higher ground , trying to stay back and protect the things i loved the most			0
i understand a lot of what the people in that movie , who live on that island , what they go through			0
@entity0 : but a lot of people that are not from that area are responding to the film , the performances and the story			1
@entity12 : but you know something ? ... this is a story that has a lot of love in it , passion , a lot of family unity			1
all of these different things , people naturally respond to these things			0
everywhere we went , from the @entity221 to the @entity222 , all the people responded the same to it			0
it 's a movie that you get a lot of feeling when you watch it			0
it 's a movie that everybody can go see , the @entity230 , the @entity231 , the @entity232 , the @entity233 , the blacks , the whites			0
everybody can go see and love			0

i fell in love with the bakery business and went from bakery , to restaurants , to other bakeries			1
that 's all i ever did , my whole life			0
never tried to do nothing else			0
i loved it and i love what i do , where i worked hard and put something together and opened my own business			0
@entity0 : @entity14 is the first person you 've brought to life on - screen			0
