-- nuclear power is so expensive compared with other forms of energy that it has become " really hard " to justify , according to the chief executive of @entity6 , one of the world 's largest suppliers of atomic equipment			1
" it 's really a gas and wind world today , " said @entity11 , referring to two sources of electricity he said most countries are shifting towards as natural gas becomes " permanently cheap "			1
" when i talk to the guys who run the oil companies they say look , they 're finding more gas all the time			0
it 's just hard to justify nuclear , really hard			2
gas is so cheap and at some point , really , economics rule , " mr @entity11 told the @entity0 in an interview in @entity28 at the weekend			1
" so i think some combination of gas , and either wind or solar ... that 's where we see most countries around the world going			1
" mr @entity11 's comments underline the impact on the global energy landscape of the @entity45 shale gas revolution , @entity48 's @entity47 nuclear meltdown and falling prices for some types of renewable power			1
the shale boom has sent @entity45 natural gas prices down to 10 - year lows , a trend some analysts believe will spread elsewhere , while the nuclear industry faces added costs and uncertainty after @entity47			0
at the same time , a 75 per cent fall in solar panel market prices in the past three years has made solar power competitive with daytime retail electricity prices in some countries , according to a recent report by @entity65 , while offshore wind turbine prices have steadily declined			0
such factors pose dilemmas for countries such as the @entity70 , which is trying to build new nuclear plants without public subsidy			0
the ruling coalition is also split over whether to set a new target to make the electricity sector virtually free of carbon emissions by 2030 -- a plan @entity78 , the conservative finance minister , opposes but many @entity79 back			0
mr @entity11 lent weight to the @entity79 argument , saying @entity6 had found existing @entity83 carbon targets helpful			1
" i think standards sometimes really drive innovation , " he said			0
" to a certain extent at least , knowing what the rules are and being able to innovate against it is not a bad thing			0
" mr @entity11 played down the impact of changing energy trends on a company as large as @entity6 , which reported annual profits of $ 13bn for 2011 ( on revenues of $ 142bn ) and sells products for every leading source of energy , from gas and wind turbines nuclear reactors and oil drilling gear , to gas and wind turbines			1
" we 've got them all , so in some ways when you have them all you do n't have to be so smart about anything , " he said			0
analysts estimate @entity6 's nuclear revenues , from a joint venture with @entity48 's @entity114 , at an estimated $ 1bn , or less than 1 per cent of annual global sales			2
mr @entity11 is visiting @entity28 during the @entity116 , which @entity6 sponsors			2
the company will announce on monday that it has made more than $ 1bn in sales from @entity116 host cities since 2006 , including $ 100m from the @entity28 games , where @entity6 has sold several power systems , 120 electric vehicle charging stations and thousands of lights			2
