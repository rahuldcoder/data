-- what do @entity2 , @entity3 , and an " @entity4 " very inventive columnist all have in common ? every now and then , when the situation calls for it , they 've been known to bend , sculpt , or otherwise contort the facts to their liking			1
hey , if it saves @entity12 's mother ... the story goes that , as a child , @entity16 chopped down the backyard cherry tree and then admitted the whole sordid affair to his beloved father : " i can not tell a lie , " he is said to have said			1
" it was i who chopped down your cherry tree			1
" this leads me to a couple of thoughts : first , what were the @entity31 thinking ? color me cautious , but i 've never been a big believer in allowing children direct access to an ax			1
ditto hatchets , swords , tomahawks , muskets , and @entity39			1
second , i can not tell a lie ; had i been in that very same situation , there 's no doubt in my mind that i 'd have looked my beloved father straight in the eye and told a lie			2
and that , my friends , along with the wooden teeth and powdered wig , is what separates me from our first president			2
i could tell you i believe it is imperative that we be absolutely meticulous with the truth 100 percent of the time , but the truth is -- i 'd be lying			2
you see , i live in @entity61 , where manhole covers explode and construction cranes crash from the sky and people slip through the space between the subway platform and the train , and you feel almost giddy with relief on those days when you manage to make it home in one piece			2
the bottom line is this : life is short , time is precious , and i do n't want to spend saturday night watching my friend , the would - be actress , do a walk - on in " @entity79			1
" it 's not that i do n't love my friend , and it 's not that i do n't love " @entity83 " ( okay , that 's a lie , nobody actually loves " @entity83 " )			2
it 's just that i reserve saturday night for slathering my reptilelike feet in @entity85 as my daughter shampoos her @entity88 doll in the toilet			1
but try explaining that to a friend who has just spent $ 200 on a brocade bustle and is flying her parents in from @entity93 for her off - off - off - @entity96 debut			2
my choices ? well , i can sit through " @entity83 " with a lovely couple from @entity99 and a running time of two hours and 46 minutes that i 'll never get back			2
i can pray that one of my undermoisturized feet will suddenly fossilize so that i can use it to knock myself unconscious			2
or i can say , " darn the luck , that 's the night i have to ... " fill in fiendishly fabricated excuse here			0
and , yes , i know , this makes me sound kind of awful , but i ask that you refrain from judging me until you 've endured an evening of musical theater based on the early years of @entity109 , courtesy of this same friend			0
honesty is a delightful policy , but i 'm here to tell you that without at least a few lies , @entity115 with the family would be a thing of the past , first dates would end faster than you can dismiss your biological clock with a jaunty " que sera , sera ... , " every political figure who intentionally linked @entity121 with @entity122 would be forced to resign in disgrace , and any number of plastic surgeons throughout the greater @entity127 area would end their lives in the gutter holding large cardboard signs that read will botox for food			1
ask any man in a healthy relationship , and he will tell you that when his wife comes home with a horrific haircut , it 's a mistake for him to start feverishly skimming the @entity140 for an attorney while muttering , " i think we 've got a lawsuit here			0
the bastard who did this to you will never trim bangs in this town again ! " @entity0 : how you ( yes , you ! ) should live your life no , he must greet her with the simple phrase that @entity156 ( boyfriend extraordinaire , father of the aforementioned shampoo girl ) uses to chill me out whenever i despair			1
he will look up from whatever he 's doing , pause , tilt his head , then casually ask : " are you losing weight ? " @entity162 : a brief one act @entity164 : plastic is destroying the earth ! @entity167 : are you losing weight ? l : the creepy guy who hangs out on @entity171 followed me into @entity173 to announce that i remind him of a young @entity174 ! j : are you losing weight ? l : i 've put on three pounds since breakfast ! j : are you losing weight ? what can i say ? he 's lying , i know he 's lying and yet it works for us			1
i am also a firm believer in lying to chatty cabdrivers ( " sir , i have the kind of menstrual cramps that could turn a lesser woman homicidal , so you need to trust me when i tell you that it 's beyond crucial for us to travel in complete silence " ) , my dental hygienist ( " of course i floss			0
flossing is my life " ) , and my 5 - year - old ( " @entity12 's mother is alive and well			1
she has merely relocated to a breathtaking piece of beachfront property off the coast of @entity199 with her hunky new boyfriend , @entity200 , who is both incredibly wealthy and deeply sensitive to her every need " )			0
@entity0 : what makes a relationship work to this day , @entity206 believes that @entity207 is only open when my parents visit @entity209 ; the shelves are stocked as @entity212 and @entity213 's plane touches down and the doors to the store lock as soon as they head back to @entity217			1
here is the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth : my name is @entity164 , and i am a liar , though a good marketing consultant could probably finesse the word into something a bit more palatable : " @entity228 " might be good , or " @entity229 " could work			1
my mother insists that , at the end of the day , what i am is a storyteller -- and she might have a point			0
@entity235 says that " we tell ourselves stories in order to live			0
" i think that 's right			0
forget what i tell cabdrivers for sport or dental hygienists for spin control or " @entity12 " readers for peace of mind			0
it 's the lies we tell ourselves that determine the particular arc of our stories			1
i tell myself that it 's never too late to master @entity254 and piecrust , that one day i 'll appreciate @entity256 and understand calculus			0
i tell myself that i 'll be able to guarantee my daughter a life of joy and confidence and financial security in a universe that 's just and safe and green			1
to be honest , i have my doubts			0
perhaps i was born predisposed to pessimism or maybe i 've witnessed too much pain , but my mind is forever taking me to the dark side and i am afraid of the dark			0
so i sugarcoat and i gloss over , and i rationalize and , yes , i sometimes fictionalize my little story			0
i tell rose - colored lies because @entity272 only takes a girl so far , because i want with all my heart to believe in something just a bit sweeter than what i see on the 6 o'clock news			1
and because , to tell you the truth , i 've always been a sucker for a happy ending -- even if it means my pants catch fire			0
