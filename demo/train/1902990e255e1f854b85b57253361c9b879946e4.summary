-- it was late morning on saturday and the day so far had been relatively calm			1
fears of widespread bloody clashes during @entity5 's election process had failed to turn into reality			1
we had decided to go to a suburb of @entity9 , an area called @entity10 , where i had heard a group of pro-election campaigners were marching to the @entity10 administration office where voting ballots for that constituency were kept			1
that office had been blocked by anti-election protestors			2
a few hours later , the pro-election protesters arrived but kept a distance of several hundred meters from their counterparts			1
all of a sudden , i heard the sound of firecrackers being thrown back and forth though i could n't work out exactly where the noise was coming from			2
then -- the sound of a gunshot			2
i saw pro-election protesters flinch and throw themselves to the ground			1
things went quiet for a bit			2
then some pro-election protesters started gathering together , and i ran over to see what was going on			1
it was a man sitting on the floor			2
he was shot in the chest , but could still talk			1
what had been a relatively peaceful protest that day turned violent with no warning and this man the first casualty			2
the pro-election protesters started to yell at an anti-government protest group who had just arrived with a big loudspeaker truck on the other side of @entity10 intersection in @entity9			1
one pro-election protester told me the shot was fired from that side			1
i thought i should withdraw , and decided to catch up with my colleagues , who had just crossed the road			2
as i crossed the road , a speaker on the truck said " please keep hidden on the left side of our truck , and walk slowly			2
" i moved behind a square - shaped cement barrier , and thought maybe i could put my camera on top of the barrier and take a steady shot as the truck passed by			1
that 's when a group of three masked men ran from behind the truck			2
i thought , " that 's strange , their leader said to walk along the truck			0
" that 's when i realized the men were running toward me , toward my camera			0
they saw me for sure			0
the group of men reached my position and there was only a low cement barrier between us			0
suddenly they started firing handguns in the direction of the pro-election protesters			1
one man carried a large green bag , which looked to conceal a rifle			0
i was sitting upright , but i dropped my back to the ground immediately			0
all i could think was that i had to keep my camera recording			0
would my lens capture the gunmen ? once i felt like i had gotten the footage , my next thought was : " i should get out of here ? after all , the gunfire was still going			1
" i peeked my head from behind the cement barricade and i asked a nearby man , " can i leave , please ? or should i stay ? " only after i had spoken , did i notice the pistol in his hand			0
" you journalist , do n't film this			0
if i have to destroy your camera , then do n't blame me			0
" so i had to put my camera down			0
apart from myself , there were at least a half - dozen other cameramen who were stuck and trapped along these gunmen , for 40 minutes or more			1
i asked the same man , " is it a good time for us to leave ? " he said okay			0
" keep yourself lower than the barriers and crawl			0
" so we left -- i went first			0
we crawled along the road , keeping next to the cement barriers along the way			0
i crawled past six pistol - wielding gunmen who were mingling with anti-government protesters			1
some gunmen wore masks , some did n't			1
they were firing toward the pro-election protesters the whole time			1
i could feel bullets zipping not far past my ears			0
while crawling , i also saw another two gunmen with rifles , unmasked			1
they , too , were shooting in the direction of the pro-election protesters			1
in the end , it probably took about 15 minutes to reunite with my colleagues at the other side of the road			0
but it felt like forever			0
and though only a small moment in what has been months of protests , it served as a reminder and a warning that the situation is far from resolved in @entity5 -- that passions remain high and that bloodshed is sadly only a moment of madness away .			0
