-- the director of the @entity2 defended friday an agent 's actions in impersonating an @entity6 reporter to track down a suspect -- a tactic criticized by the news agency as " unacceptable			1
" in a letter to the @entity12 , @entity2 director @entity10 said the deception had occurred in 2007 , as the agency tried to solve a series of bomb threats and cyberattacks directed at a high school in the @entity20 area			1
and he rebuffed criticism of the agency 's methods , saying , " we do use deception at times to catch crooks , but we are acting responsibly and legally			0
" @entity10 said the agency had determined that the suspect was a narcissist and so set out to snare him making use of that			2
the agent who posed as an @entity6 reporter " asked if the suspect would be willing to review a draft article about the threats and attacks , to be sure that the anonymous suspect was portrayed fairly , " he wrote			1
as a result of the suspect clicking on a link relating to the fake story , the agency was able to track him down using court - authorized tools , @entity10 said			1
" no actual story was published , and no one except the suspect interacted with the undercover ' @entity6 ' employee or saw the fake draft story , " he wrote			1
" only the suspect was fooled , and it led to his arrest and the end of a frightening period for a high school			1
" @entity2 tactics ' undermine @entity6 ' however , @entity6 executive editor @entity58 slammed the agency 's tactics , according to an @entity6 report			1
" this latest revelation of how the @entity2 misappropriated the trusted name of @entity6 doubles our concern and outrage , expressed earlier to attorney general @entity69 , about how the agency 's unacceptable tactics undermine @entity6 and the vital distinction between the government and the press , " @entity62 said in a statement			1
the @entity75 sent a letter thursday to @entity10 and @entity69 expressing its deep concern over what it said was an " inexcusable " failure to comply with their own offices ' guidelines on impersonation of the news media			2
" the utilization of news media as a cover for delivery of electronic surveillance software is unacceptable			0
this practice endangers the media 's credibility and creates the appearance that it is not independent of the government , " it said			0
" it undermines media organizations ' ability to independently report on law enforcement			0
it lends itself to the appearance that media organizations are compelled to speak on behalf of the government			0
" ' @entity103 disinformation ' in a letter sent to the @entity106 last week , the @entity6 requested @entity69 's word that the @entity106 would never again misrepresent itself as the news agency , an @entity6 report said			0
the @entity6 also asked for policies to ensure the department does not impersonate other news organizations in the future			0
" the @entity2 both misappropriated the trusted name of @entity6 and created a situation where our credibility could have been undermined on a large scale , " @entity6 general counsel @entity113 wrote			1
" the @entity2 may have intended this false story as a trap for only one person			0
however , the individual could easily have reposted this story to social networks , distributing to thousands of people , under our name , what was essentially a piece of government disinformation			0
" @entity10 's letter said the methods used in the case were " proper and appropriate " under @entity106 and @entity2 guidelines at the time -- but acknowledged that higher approval levels would probably be needed for the use of such a technique today			2
" every undercover operation involves ' deception , ' which has long been a critical tool in fighting crime , " his letter concluded			0
" the @entity2 's use of such techniques is subject to close oversight , both internally and by the courts that review our work			2
