-- @entity2 executives love a movie franchise : a series of films with an in - built audience who return time and again to enjoy their favorite characters , stories and themes			1
such box - office gold is usually based on pre-existing properties , for example comics ( " @entity16 " et al ) , novels ( " @entity18 " ) -- even theme - park rides ( " @entity19 " )			2
but the strong interest that followed the death of actor @entity22 last weekend has been boosted by his crucial role in an unlikely franchise whose appeal has built steadily during the past decade , especially outside the @entity27			1
the six " @entity29 " films have spawned a globe - trotting , block - busting series , generating $ 2.4 billion in ticket sales alone since the turn of the century			1
back then few predicted that a mid-budget actioner with little - known actors set in the hi - octane world of @entity38 street - racing would still be going strong 12 years later			0
how did it happen ? released in june 2001 , " @entity45 " was a testosterone - fuelled boys - with - toys movie set around a cat - and - mouse game between an undercover cop ( @entity22 ) and his prey ( @entity44 )			1
" i remember being in @entity47 when @entity48 ( former co-chairman of @entity50 ) called to say they 'd just had the most amazing test screening of a film we 'd never heard of , called ' @entity45 , ' recalls @entity55 , former president and @entity56 of @entity57 , the distribution joint - venture between @entity50 and @entity59 which released the first three films internationally			2
" it seemed pretty domestic at the time , " continues @entity55 , now president @entity62 for @entity63			0
" it was about @entity38 street - racing , it had a relatively unknown cast , but there was a chemistry there between the lead characters and it really worked with young audiences around the world			0
i was pleasantly surprised by the international box office of the first film			1
" " @entity45 " raced to an impressive $ 145 million in the @entity27 during the lucrative and crowded summer season			1
an international release was delayed till fall to market the film as a fresh success that had swept the @entity27 while also ensuring it avoided competition from bigger rivals			0
international grosses were low compared to domestic -- but they were strong for a $ 38 million movie skewed to an @entity88 audience			1
but the chemistry between @entity22 and @entity44 that engaged audiences was missing from the next two sequels			2
for the second installment , 2003 's " @entity92 , " @entity44 was absent ( focusing on two potential franchises that positioned him as the clear star ) although @entity22 remained front and center			1
while @entity27 box office was down on its predecessor , international grosses jumped 75 % : a domestic franchise clearly had global appeal			1
as before , the @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 proved powerful markets , while @entity105 saw sales more than double , mirroring the series popularity with @entity110 audiences in the @entity27 @entity50 sat up and took note , setting the third film -- which starred neither @entity22 nor @entity44 -- in @entity113			1
at the time it made sense : @entity115 has its own street - racing scene and in 2006 was the biggest international market			0
it was also a territory the franchise had yet to crack			0
" @entity45 : @entity123 " worked for the @entity115 market , boosting box office by 28 % from the previous film			1
but while @entity115 grew , other major markets shrank and @entity88 box office halved			1
without @entity22 or @entity44 the franchise had lost its spark and seemingly run its course			1
by 2009 , with the careers of the original cast floundering , @entity44 -- now a producer -- helped orchestrate the return of all four key players from the original cast for " @entity29			0
" international success had to be the focus if the franchise was to be revived : domestic success was no longer a guarantor of franchise longevity			2
nervous executives were still unsure the package would work and skipped a release into the overheated summer market , targeting instead an @entity146 rollout and building on the success of the first feature ( the film 's tagline was " @entity152			0
it worked and audiences returned , with fresh growth in all the franchise 's previous key markets and new support in @entity159 , a traditional haven for action movies			0
" the relationship between @entity22 and @entity44 's characters was at the heart of the franchise , " explains box office analyst @entity161 of @entity163			1
" so as soon as it brought those two guys back together they were on a money train			0
" that chemistry and rivalry between @entity22 and @entity44 needed to be maintained			2
how ? by turning the movies from street - racing series into a globe - trotting action franchise rooted in frenetic auto action			2
thus 2011 's " @entity184 " became a heist caper set in @entity179 with @entity22 and @entity44 working together instead of in opposition : global appeal broadened still further by bringing back multi-national characters from across the franchise			1
but with @entity22 and @entity44 both on the wrong side of the law the series now needed a new opponent			1
enter former wrestler and human mountain @entity190 aka " @entity190			0
" " we initially designed the role for @entity195 , " @entity44 explained in an april 2011 interview			0
" one of my fans on @entity198 said i would love to see you and @entity190 in anything together			0
it really was the best choice in the world			0
" " @entity184 " became a major international player and from its late april release it landed a knockout blow on superhero slugfest " @entity208 " across several territories			0
it was also the first of the franchise to venture into the high - ticket giant - screens owned by @entity63 , its bangs and ballistics sitting well with the format 's male - heavy audience			2
by the time the @entity100 - set " @entity225 " opened in may 2013 , expectations were heady : the first film had been a domestic - weighted surprise ; the second a solid sequel ; the third a flop ; the fourth an all - or - nothing reboot ; the fifth a take - a - chance change of direction			0
the sixth was primed to be a guaranteed blockbuster			0
grossing $ 550 million at the international box office alone , " @entity225 " has become the third highest grossing film of the year worldwide behind " @entity231 " and " @entity232			1
" seventy percent of its $ 788m gross has come from overseas : as with its predecessor , @entity235 was the top grossing market ( $ 66m )			2
such heady figures were vital to sustain a movie series whose production costs had ballooned from $ 38m in 2001 to $ 160m in 2013			2
but @entity22 's death has now left the future of the franchise in question : @entity50 announced this week that production has shut down on the seventh instalment " so we can assess all options available to move forward with the franchise , " which was due to release on july 11 2014			1
many of the cast are already signed up for an eighth episode			0
" the latest was the biggest yet and the series looked set to grow and grow , " says @entity161			0
" the franchise is giddy and fun and i think it will be a real challenge for them to continue in the wake of @entity22 's death and the manner in which it occurred			1
" @entity261 contributed to this report .			0

" @entity45 " movie franchise has taken more than $ 2 billion worldwide through ticket sales
the future of the series is now being considered following the death of star @entity22
more than 60 % of its box office has come from international , boosted by @entity235 in recent years
the series floundered for several years when its two leads were absent
