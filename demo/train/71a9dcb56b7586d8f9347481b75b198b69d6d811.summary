-- in the tech world , paying a celebrity to love your product can sometimes backfire			0
on wednesday , @entity6 superstar @entity5 took to @entity7 to announce a nightmare of the mobile age : " my phone just erased everything i had in it and rebooted			1
one of the sickest feelings i 've ever had in my life ! ! ! " here 's the problem : that phone was , presumably , the @entity16 that the @entity18 star is paid big money to endorse			0
his was just the most recent in a series of public missteps by celebrities who have been increasingly called upon to create buzz for tech products			1
@entity5 quickly deleted the tweet and soon thereafter -- presumably with some help from his friends at the @entity30 gadget company -- posted this : " close call			1
wheew ! got all my info back			0
" it 's not the first time a celebrity , an endorsement deal and @entity7 have merged to create an awkward gaffe			0
just this month , @entity41 host @entity40 took the @entity42 with a smartphone from @entity44 , a major sponsor of the awards			1
but , backstage , she was caught tweeting @entity41 thoughts from her @entity47			1
@entity49 @entity48 claimed she was hacked last year ( the @entity50 ? ) when she apparently sent a tweet from an @entity47 just days after she was named a " creative director " for @entity53			1
and in 2012 , @entity54 ( or one of her staff ) raved about the new @entity57 tablet -- in a tweet using @entity7 for @entity59			0
sometimes , competing loyalties collide when gadget endorsements are involved			1
in march 2013 , " @entity63 " star @entity62 tweeted some ( sponsored ) praise for @entity66 's @entity65 , a dvr system			2
turns out , @entity68 , which airs " @entity63 , " was locked in a lawsuit with @entity66 and other dvr makers over the systems ' ability to skip ads. she did the obligatory tweet delete			0
@entity66 accused @entity68 of making her			0
and the beat goes on			0
@entity79 , a brand adviser to @entity81 companies and author of " @entity83 : @entity88 , " said such flubs are " a major risk " companies run when they sign up celebrity endorsers			2
but do n't expect the practice to go away anytime soon			0
@entity79 also said that , even in these faux - pas cases , the endorsements pay off			2
" we learned that the positive effect seems surprisingly stronger than the negative effect , " he said , citing research conducted for one of his books			2
" in reality , this means that the @entity41 viewers are much more likely to remember @entity40 's @entity44 endorsement , including the @entity44 name , and ( are ) hardly judging on the brand if a celebrity messes around with the situation			1
" and while celebrity tweets make the headlines , @entity79 said , the prevalence of social media now means they 're not the only ones we look to to decide what we think about a product			1
" the concept of conventional celebrity endorsement has expanded from just engaging the superstars to everyone from the 10 - minutes - of - fame person to even people who have carved out some niche audience on a very focused topic , " he said			0
" we 've all more or less turned into personal brands -- and thus we 're all more or less likely to witness ourselves in a brand endorsement role in the future			2

@entity5 tweeted a *complaint* about the smartphone he endorses
on social media , other celebrities have *bagged* on the brands they promote
@entity40 used @entity44 *onstage* at @entity41 , @entity47 backstage
expert says positive endorsements still *outweigh* such flubs
