@entity0 , @entity1 this is the new normal in @entity0 : protests , day and night , for more than 70 days now			2
sometimes it 's hundreds of demonstrators , sometimes just a handful			2
but they 're always outside the @entity8 , clamoring for the indictment of officer @entity10 in the shooting death of unarmed teenager @entity12			1
and with new details about the investigation leaked , tensions are escalating			0
on monday night , two protestors were detained by @entity18 police -- including @entity20 sen. @entity19			1
she was detained as she blocked traffic in the middle of the street while protesting outside the @entity0 police department			1
now , there are fears about what could happen next			0
" everybody is planning for whatever the grand jury decides , " said @entity28 , racial justice director at the @entity29			0
" certainly there are lots of us that planning peaceful protests for should it not be indicted			0
certainly there are other people that have other ideas at hand			2
" one protester put it succinctly : " if there is not an indictment , excuse my @entity47 , all hell is going to break loose			1
" new details revealed @entity12 's blood was found on the officer 's uniform and inside his police car , law enforcement sources told @entity2			1
those sources corroborated details first reported by @entity56			2
" that tends to support any testimony that there was some kind of scuffle in the police car , " said @entity2 legal analyst @entity57			0
" and if so , that tends to support officer @entity10 's testimony and his justification for using deadly force			1
" at least one of the wounds @entity12 suffered is consistent with a struggle and appeared to be fired at close range , according to a different source with first - hand knowledge of the investigation			1
at least six shots a private autopsy conducted for the @entity12 family showed that @entity12 had been shot at least six times , including twice in the head			1
but @entity57 said the newly released details about @entity12 's blood in the officer 's gun and on his uniform might only go so far in helping the officer 's case			1
" ultimately , that officer will have to come up with justification not for firing his gun the first time , but for each and every bullet that came out of his firearm -- whether at the car or away from the car , " he said			2
@entity12 's death is the subject of two inquires : one by a @entity18 grand jury considering whether @entity10 should be charged , and the other by federal investigators looking into whether any civil rights violations occurred			1
timing of the leak as anticipation mounts over the grand jury 's decision , the new details leaked by a federal source to the @entity56 could be strategic , a former @entity104 official told @entity2			0
" it could be really for , in part , a beneficial purpose , to start leading those community leaders and those leading the protests to believe that there wo n't be an indictment , " said @entity110 , former assistant director of the @entity111			0
" it may be over time , that will have a beneficial effect of no riots , no battles in the streets again			0
" @entity126 reported from @entity0 ; @entity127 reported and wrote from @entity128			0
@entity2 's @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 contributed to this report .			0
