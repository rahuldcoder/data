@entity2 , @entity1 historic talks set to begin on wednesday between the @entity5 and @entity1 could lead to " re-established relations , " but dealings between the two countries can not be considered normalized until the @entity5 trade embargo is fully lifted , a @entity1 official said tuesday			1
the official , a high - ranking member of @entity1 's foreign ministry , spoke to @entity3 and a handful of other media on condition of anonymity			0
a @entity5 delegation arriving in @entity2 on wednesday will first discuss migration accords and then begin negotiations on repairing five decades of strained relations that are expected to lead with the restoration of embassies in @entity22 and @entity2			1
the talks are set to conclude on thursday			0
most likely additional discussions would take place in @entity22 and @entity2			0
the @entity5 broke off diplomatic relations with @entity1 in 1961 over concerns that @entity29 's revolution was increasingly aligning itself with the @entity5 ' then - mortal enemy , the @entity31			1
last month , @entity1 and the @entity5 agreed to exchange prisoners and engage in the first formal negotiations to restore diplomatic relations since the rupture that led to the failed @entity35 , the @entity36 and other fraught conflicts of the @entity38			1
last week , president @entity39 eased some sanctions , including many of the restrictions that prevented @entity5 from visiting the island			1
for the first time , @entity5 will be able to travel to @entity1 by booking flights directly through @entity5 airlines and will be permitted to use @entity5 credit cards for transactions there			1
" they will be welcome , " the @entity1 official said of the wave of @entity5 expected to soon take advantage of the relaxed regulations			1
but the @entity1 foreign ministry official said while those steps are positive signs , they did not go far enough and @entity1 officials would push for the lifting of all trade sanctions and the so - called " wet foot , dry foot " policy that allows @entity1 who reach @entity5 territory to stay in the country			1
a @entity5 official who spoke on background monday said only the @entity68 could change those laws			0
the @entity5 official said the @entity71 negotiators , led by @entity5 assistant secretary of state @entity72 , will argue that caps on diplomats stationed in @entity2 should be lifted to increase staffing numbers , as should the restrictions currently placed on @entity5 diplomats that forbid them traveling more than 25 miles from the interests section			1
@entity1 should also have unfettered access to a future @entity5 embassy , the official said			2
but the @entity1 official said first @entity22 should abandon efforts to support the island 's dissident community , which @entity1 authorities say works with @entity5 officials to topple the island 's single - party communist government			2
@entity5 officials have said human rights concerns and efforts to strengthen @entity1 civil society remain key @entity5 policies in @entity1			2
the @entity71 is also carrying out a review that could lead to removing @entity1 from the @entity5 list of countries that sponsor state terrorism			2
the @entity5 official said it was possible that embassies could be reopened before that review was complete			0
but the @entity1 official said it would be contradictory to re-establish diplomatic relations without first removing @entity1 from the terrorism list			0
countries on the list face political and economic sanctions			0
in a twist worthy of a spy thriller , a @entity110 intelligence - gathering ship on tuesday arrived in @entity2 , docking in plain view in the city 's port			0
the @entity115 , a @entity117 class intelligence ship , visited @entity1 twice in 2014 , apparently to conduct electronic eavesdropping on the @entity5			0
the county 's state - run media made no mention of the ship 's return tuesday , but the @entity1 official said any navy was welcome to dock on the island as long as it had " peaceful intentions			0

@entity5 delegation in @entity2 will begin negotiations on repairing five decades of strained relations
