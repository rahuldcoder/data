-- why stay in a humdrum hotel when you can sleep in a sewer pipe in @entity4 ? or a salt palace in @entity6 ? here are 15 of the world 's most memorable accommodations 1			1
@entity9 ( @entity10 ) originally a research laboratory , this fully underwater hotel sits at the bottom of the @entity14 in @entity10 's @entity15 , and can only be reached by scuba diving down six meters			1
the lodge can accommodate two couples and has showers , a microwave and a fridge			0
the real attraction are the fish ; the lodge is like a goldfish bowl in reverse , where you sit and watch angelfish , parrotfish , barracuda and snappers peering in at you through the window			0

the drainpipes are two meters in diameter and two and a half meters long , with a porthole , a front door to close and a cozy nest to snuggle into , which includes a low - slung futon , bedside lamp , woolly blanket and light sleeping bag			1
it 's novel , it 's bold , and the best part is that you pay as much , or as little , as you want			1

@entity66 ( @entity67 ) being suffused by the northern lights from the inside of a glass igloo is one of the more novel ways of admiring one of nature 's most stunning phenomena			1
located within the @entity77 , deep in the snowbound @entity79 area of northern @entity67 , the cabins are built from ice or glass ; both are surprisingly warm , but somewhat lacking in privacy			0

many people have been in the doghouse , but few can say that they 've actually slept in one			0
then again , the @entity84 , while shaped like a dog -- albeit a dog nine meters high -- is no kennel			1

the @entity147 ( @entity148 ) regarded as one of the most romantic hideaways in @entity151 , the @entity147 certainly fits the bill for most lovebirds			1
the former dovecote , which fell into disrepair in the early 20th century , has been restored and converted into a cozy self - catering place that can sleep up to four people , though it 's ideal for two			1
within the one - meter - thick walls are a glass - fronted balcony bedroom , glorious wooden lantern roof and a sauna			1

@entity200 ( @entity6 ) at the @entity200 , the walls , floors , beds and chairs are made entirely of white rock salt			0
set on the eastern shore of the @entity208 , a vast expanse of white salt 3,650 meters above sea level , it 's great for stargazing and watching sunset colors reflect off the salt lake			2
the hotel has a spa and salty golf course			0
@entity200 , @entity208 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity6 ; +591 6842 0888 ; rates from $ 100 for a single 9			0

@entity241 's @entity240 ( @entity242 ) on @entity242 's idyllic @entity243 at the end of a pine - tree clad valley lies the village of @entity247 , where the hoteliers specialize in a different type of accommodation -- tree houses			1
these simple wooden bungalows set amid the branches have long been popular with backpackers in the region and are growing in popularity			0
@entity241 's , one of the original lodges , now operates more than 100 bungalows , plus a few larger cabins and dormitories			2
@entity262 's is unashamedly hedonistic -- people come to party , hard , with the potential for disaster offered by a potent combination of mass drinking and accommodation several feet off the ground just adding to the fun			2
@entity241 's @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity242 ; +90 ( 0 ) 242 892 12 50 ; from @entity275 ( $ 20 ) 11			2

@entity276 ; $ 15,000 per person for one - week package , including transportation , two nights in an underwater suite , scuba diving and wine tasting 12			2
@entity305 's @entity304 ( @entity306 ) while a cave sounds like a questionable place to stay the night , much less pay to stay the night , @entity305 's @entity307 in @entity306 is n't about masochism or asceticism , or even being cheap			1
with prices starting at $ 260 a night , @entity305 's @entity313 is no mere hole			2
guests stay in a carpeted , fully furnished room 21 meters below the surface , dug into a cliff face of 65 - million - year - old sandstone			2
there 's a tv , dvd player and selection of movies , but guests might find themselves more fascinated with the walls , a " geologist 's dream " with a " 360 - degree view of cross-bedding , petrified and carbonized wood and plant fragments , " according to the hotel			1
while reaching the cave ( there 's only one , with bedding for four ) requires a short hike , these " difficulties " also mean maximum privacy ... unless you count the ring - tailed cats that are said to occasionally visit			1
@entity305 's @entity304 , 5001 @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity306 ; +1 505 860 3812 ; from $ 280 per night 13			2
