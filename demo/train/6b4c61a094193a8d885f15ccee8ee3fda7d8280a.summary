@entity0 , @entity1 -- i am sitting here in front of my computer , looking at the headline that former @entity9 football coach @entity8 has died , and i honestly do n't know how or what i should feel			1
if he had passed a year ago , it would be a no - brainer			0
for a @entity16 soldier who dedicated more than 50 years to one institution and one wife during a time in which examples of both grow rarer by the decade , it seems flags should be flown at half staff			1
but then there 's @entity26			2
and then there 's @entity8 's silence and then ... well with all due respect to the @entity8 family , his loved ones and the @entity9 community , uninterrupted mourning becomes difficult			1
now for those reading this column expecting a glowing obituary for a renowned coach who truly deserves one , you may want to click elsewhere as this is not that kind of a piece			1
and for anyone hoping i rip @entity8 to shreds , again you will need to look elsewhere			1
i am writing for those of us trapped in the middle -- for those who watched the @entity9 story unfold without the ability to see the world in black and white			1
i am genuinely saddened to hear a wife has lost her husband and children have lost their father			0
but that mourning for the @entity57 subconsciously shifts to mourning the innocence of the little boys that could have been saved had @entity8 fought to protect them with as much vigilance as he used to protect his good name in the aftermath of the scandal			2
it 's unfair to blame @entity8 for what @entity26 is accused of doing , but it 's impossible to accept @entity8 did anywhere near to all he could by simply alerting two university officials to one incident			1
years passed and the coach did n't utter one word about what he knew about @entity26 to the media but he managed to address the media on his front porch within hours of his firing			2
if you 've ever held a crying child in your arms , it 's hard to see @entity8 as a victim of the media			1
but if you 've ever made a mistake , if you 've ever mishandled a difficult situation , if you 've ever done something you 've regretted , then it should be hard to characterize @entity8 -- a man who has done so much good outside of football -- as a pariah			1
and therein lies the rub : what do you do when a wonderful man who made a terrible mistake dies ? how do you properly honor an admirable life without whitewashing the egregious shortcomings that ruined the lives of others ? i see the @entity9 students paying tribute to @entity8 in front of his statue on campus and wonder how many would still do so if they had young children of their own to protect			1
how many would do so if they were one of @entity26 's alleged victims			0
i am not directly tied to the scandal at @entity110 , so i was n't among those who were wronged and thus it 's not really my place to judge or forgive			0
but who among us can forget ? though the coroner 's office will say cancer was the cause of death , those who know the story well will say @entity8 died of a broken heart , a sad ending for a man who truly deserved better			1
and then you think about the children who allegedly grew up broken because of @entity26 's acts and @entity8 's silence and you wonder who deserved better than them ? but this kind of conflict is not unique to @entity8			1
i look at the way people lionize president @entity136 and i wonder how they feel about @entity136 letting years go by without publicly addressing the @entity138 epidemic ( possibly because the disease initially was seen as primarily affecting gays ) or that he vetoed a comprehensive anti-apartheid act that would have placed sanctions on @entity143			0
i watched the response to the manslaughter verdict against @entity147 's doctor and marveled at the passion people had for justice for a likely drug addict who was twice accused of child molestation			2
if @entity147 was n't such an amazing artist , would the people outside of the courthouse decked out in glitter and holding signs be so forgiving ? and did they really forgive @entity147 for his alleged trespasses or did they simply chose to ignore them because they got in the way of their neatly packaged narrative ? @entity8 has died , and i do not know how to compartmentalize the good from the bad			2
just as i am incapable of thinking about @entity136 without seeing the thousands and thousands of ailing @entity165 he did n't even try to help			0
or how hard it is to listen to a @entity147 song and not wonder about the boys he was accused of molesting -- or how hard it is to watch reruns of " @entity173 " and not recall the racist rant from the actor who played my once favorite character , @entity178			0
that 's the good thing about 24 - hour media : it is hard to keep dirty little secrets			0
but this is also the bad thing			0
in a lot of ways , life was easier when we did n't know as much			0
we could have mourned a hero like @entity8 and not feel conflicted			2
if you do feel conflicted			0
some people can see the world in black and white			0
i 'm not one of those people			0

@entity202 says @entity8 was a renowned coach who gave his life to @entity9
*ordinarily* , he says , you would fly flags at half staff for such a man
@entity202 : @entity8 's *failure* to speak out *forcefully* to stop child *sex* abuse scars his *reputation*
but @entity202 says many other great men have *exhibited* terrible flaws
