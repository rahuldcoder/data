@entity0 -- the @entity4 created and controls a paramilitary force of 3,000 @entity6 that conducts clandestine missions targeting @entity8 and @entity10 fighters in @entity11 , a @entity3 official told @entity1 on wednesday			1
the official described the force as " well - trained " and " effective			0
" " you 're talking about one of the finest @entity6 fighting forces , which has made major contributions to security and stability , " the official said			1
the official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the topic			0
the @entity23 were first revealed in a new book by @entity25 , associate editor at the @entity26			1
" @entity27 , " which lays out deep divisions in the @entity30 administration over @entity6 strategy , will be released monday			0
according to that book , by the end of a 2009 strategy review , @entity30 concluded that the task in @entity6 could not succeed without wiping out @entity8 and @entity6 @entity10 havens operating with impunity in the border tribal areas of @entity11 , the @entity26 reported wednesday			1
" we need to make clear to people that the cancer is in @entity11 , " @entity30 is quoted as saying in @entity25 's book , the @entity26 said			1
a @entity4 spokesman would not comment on the paramilitary force			1
the counterterrorism teams were first formed around 2002 and operated only within @entity6 , current and former @entity3 officials told @entity1			1
according to a former senior intelligence official , the idea was " to find people who would blend into the @entity6 society to do a lot of the clandestine work " in that country			2
there is some coordination between the @entity4 's paramilitary force and @entity3 military forces , according to a senior defense official			1
the official said some level of coordination is necessary , so that friendly forces know when and where each unit is operating			0
" we are constantly in contact with our allies in both @entity11 and @entity6 , as well as our @entity3 inter-agency partners , " the official said			1
the border region is key for anti-terrorism efforts and the @entity3 military has been working with both @entity11 and @entity6 as part of a crackdown against militants along the border , with @entity3 troops operating on the @entity6 side , the defense official said			1
" we still believe that ground zero for @entity8 's operations and planning is the border area between @entity6 and @entity11 , " the defense official said			1
as the border area in @entity11 became more of a safe haven for @entity8 , the @entity10 and other extremists , the counterterrorism teams ' mission expanded into @entity11			2
the former intelligence official said the border is a tribal area where people on both sides easily move back and forth			0
" @entity6 can cross the border in ways @entity3 can not , " said the official			2
a former @entity3 counterterrorism official said a team would enter @entity11 to gather intelligence and to provide targeting information to help the @entity4 take out suspected terrorists with missiles from unmanned aircraft			2
this official said only a very few senior @entity11 leaders were aware of the teams and wondered what the fallout might be within @entity11 , suggesting the @entity4 's @entity6 army could be " at tremendous risk " if it continues to operate in @entity11			1
" @entity11 will be on the lookout for them now , " said the former official			2
but @entity11 officials refuted the claims that @entity4 - controlled forces are operating within @entity11			2
" @entity11 will never allow boots on its soil , " @entity116 spokesman @entity115 said , referring to foreign troops			2
" this is one of our red lines			0
" a senior @entity11 military official added that there are 954 checkpoints along the border that are manned by @entity11 security forces			1
he said it would be " next to impossible for a group of people to enter @entity11 to chase @entity8 and @entity10 militants			0
" the official did not want to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media			0
@entity8 in @entity11 remains a lethal enemy for the @entity3 , a counterterrorism official said this week			0
but with the help of allies , the @entity3 has been able to score " lots of successes " against the group , said the official , who also requested anonymity			0
that includes the success of @entity3 unmanned predator strikes in @entity11 regions along the border with @entity6			1
since the @entity30 administration took office at the beginning of 2009 , missile attacks on suspected terrorists in @entity11 have increased dramatically			0
the @entity3 has " cut into their ability to plot , plan and train , but they remain very dangerous , and they are still the hub to all spokes , the heart of @entity8 , " the @entity3 official said			0
" no one 's even close to saying it 's over in @entity11			0
in fact , we not only have to keep up the pressure there , we have to spread it to @entity8 's nodes and affiliates elsewhere			0
" @entity1 's @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
