an analysis of video of hospitalized @entity9 released by state - run tv suggests people are not suffering from a chemical weapons attack , nor are they being treated as though they were in such an attack , the @entity17 military official said			1
" the actions in the video do n't match up to a chemical weapons response , " the official said , adding that @entity9 hospitals may have a shortage of the supplies that would be expected to be used in such an attack			1
analysts believe it 's possible people in the video were deliberately exposed to a " caustic " agent such as chlorine			0

" he also stressed the investigation must include " unfettered access , " something that has not been possible in some previous attempts to investigate claims of violence			0
@entity113 's promise of an investigation into the claims followed a formal , written request by @entity128 's government for an independent investigation			2
while @entity113 told reporters at the @entity1 he was aware of the rebel claims of a chemical weapons attack by the government , he did not say whether those claims will also be investigated			1
a senior administration official , traveling with @entity16 in @entity108 , told reporters the @entity17 supports a @entity1 investigation but said that it should include allegations by the @entity9 government and the rebels			1

not be limited to any one allegation , " said the official , who also spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason as the others			0
the @entity17 , meanwhile , continues to monitor @entity9 's chemical weapons very closely , the official said			1

@entity9 has denied the allegation			0
the @entity164 prohibits the production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons			0
