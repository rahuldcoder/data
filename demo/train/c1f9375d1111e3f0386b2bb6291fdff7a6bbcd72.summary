@entity0 -- what a difference			0
@entity3 assumed the presidency four years ago on a day full of history and hope			1
the second time around there is less hype , far lower expectations , and no illusions about the capital 's political climate			0
" i just want things to work , " then president - elect @entity3 told @entity1 in an interview days before taking office in 2009			1
to revisit that conversation is to be reminded that on many of the big issues on the original @entity3 agenda , @entity0 did anything but work -- or at least work together			1
@entity3 's address : full text his signature first - term achievement -- health care reform -- was accomplished despite near unanimous @entity28 opposition			1
many other priorities he listed just before taking the oath of office four years ago are still waiting for serious attention - or progress -- as he begins term two			1
" the deficit levels i 'm inheriting -- over $ 1 trillion coming out of last year -- that is unsustainable , " the president - elect said in his final interview before the 2009 inauguration			2
yet deficits in each of his first four years topped $ 1 trillion			2
more of his first inaugural wish list : " let 's get a handle on @entity43			2
let 's get a handle on @entity48			2
" four other priorities for @entity3 's next four years deficits , @entity43 and @entity48 are now carrying over to the second - term agenda			1
new to the list is a promise to push an assault weapons ban and other gun controls			0
what do all of these have in common ? they are issues ripe for confrontations with @entity28 , especially at a time the @entity28 's conservative base is determined to reassert itself			0
yet that wish list also puts the president at odds , to varying degrees , with members of his own party			0
liberals , for example , vow to resist any major @entity48 changes			1
@entity71 and conservative democrats , especially those with tough re-election prospects in 2014 , are hardly rushing to embrace new gun controls			0
inaugural poet : my story is @entity79 's not to mention a varied and unpredictable portfolio of international challenges -- from a volatile @entity82 to evolving economic and security challenges in an @entity84 increasingly defined by @entity85			0
and then there is this : the ticking clock of any president 's second term			0
how long will it take before the lame duck debate begins in earnest ? second term priorities " they wo n't have more than a year , 18 months tops , " said the veteran @entity28 strategist @entity96 , who in addition to her deep campaign experience served as a top adviser to president @entity100 and his vice president , @entity101			0
her own experience in the second @entity100 - @entity101 term shapes her early take on the political climate as @entity3 begins his fifth year in office : " with the six - year itch midterm and a 2016 open primary looming , it will be all positioning all the time			1
" as in the first four years , the strength of the @entity79 economy will determine more than anything else how much room the president has to advance his top priorities			0
a unified voice rises from a divided place : mr. president , please fix @entity79 education			0
@entity122 adviser @entity121 lists those as first - term priorities that , in his view , not only carry over to the next four but will shape whether the second @entity3 term is a success			1
" how do we position the @entity79 economy for the 21st century ? " is @entity121 's one sentence take on the president 's second - term challenge			1
a tale of two terms @entity3 's preparations included a recent session with presidential historians to discuss not only the climate he faces , but the historical differences for past presidents given the opportunity to serve a second term			1
president @entity3 is the fourth of the last five presidents to get a second term			2
the others - @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity100 - all had major events that undermined their political standing			2
for @entity147 it was @entity152			0
@entity148 had the gift of a booming economy , but any thought of making progress on major generational challenges , like @entity48 and @entity43 , were sidetracked by the @entity159 scandal and the impeachment saga			1
@entity3 in select company @entity100 began his second term with opposition to the @entity164 on the rise , and was further damaged by the deeply held view that his administration failed to properly respond to @entity168			2
to @entity96 , a fierce @entity28 critic , a major early second - term challenge for @entity3 will be to change what she sees as a political reflex that has undermined his ability to work with @entity28 leaders in @entity175			1
" second terms exacerbate both strengths and weaknesses , " she said			0
" if you are humility challenged , self - reverential and self - righteous like @entity3 , you get even more hubris and demonize rather than debate your opponents			2
" @entity183 on @entity3 at start of second term : ' in simpatico ' @entity3 aides bristle at suggestions he is responsible for the trust deficit with the @entity28 ; they say @entity28 made a decision very early on in the first term to oppose virtually every @entity3 initiative			1
in their view , the burden is on the @entity28 in term two to show a more cooperative tone and mindset			0
@entity96 also raised an operational challenge for second - term presidents : high turnover in senior positions , from the @entity201 staff to key @entity203 positions			1
" anyone who has n't left is exhausted , " she said			0
" anyone who is new is not top drawer			0
" @entity3 's second - term priorities			1

at the start of his second term , @entity3 has major issues left undone from his first
deficits , @entity43 and @entity48 are carrying over into his second - term agenda .
education . science and technology advances also are issues that may shape next four years
