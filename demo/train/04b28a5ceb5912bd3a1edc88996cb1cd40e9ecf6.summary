-- they 're not just constant characters on a television screen , these candidates who every four years seek the presidency			1
they 're not present only to give us something to talk about for months on end			1
" what you feel like on certain days is a slow - moving target , " said @entity9 , reflecting on the unsuccessful campaign when he sought reelection to the @entity12			2
they grin and wave at crowds , asking for our votes while implying eternal sunniness			2
to reveal that they are vulnerable to hurt would seem to be an admission of weakness			2
" i did n't like it , " @entity24 said , speaking of being defeated when he ran on his own for president			1
but i never let my feelings be reflected publicly			1
i never let it out			0
it 's not my nature			1
" the candidates know that only one person can win a presidential election , and that the loser , no matter how accomplished , will forever be associated with the fact of his defeat			1
sometimes it is the incumbent ; sometimes it is a challenger			0
the feeling of emptiness is the same , although the men who have lived in the @entity12 and have then been denied a second term understand especially well just what it is they will be leaving behind			0
news : polling center -- down to the wire " i think when i lost the reelection campaign for the presidency , " @entity47 said , " i think i did my best , and although @entity50 was pretty -- well , bitter -- after the loss , i was not			0
i had to spend a long time assuaging her disappointment -- i 'm sure she would agree with this if she was here in the room right now -- and i said to her , ' @entity50 , we have a good life ahead of us			0
' " in my conversations over the decades with men who have served as president of the @entity66 and who have had to leave office before they wanted to , we have spent significant time talking about the emotions that accompany the leave - taking			1
these are men who have reached a pinnacle the rest of us will never come close to achieving			0
yet when they are turned away , their past accomplishments can not fully soothe the sting			0
on tuesday night , two men of considerable talent , soaring ambition and lifetimes full of triumphs will find out which one of them has been selected for a job they each covet , and which one has been rejected			0
either @entity84 or @entity85 is certain to be wounded to his core , even while the other man is celebrating to wild cheers			0
news : if @entity84 wins a second term ... very few people have known what it is like , on that highest of levels , to be seen as having failed			1
" if i had feelings , " @entity95 said , " i probably would n't have even survived			1
" his own final leave - taking , of course , was different from an election - night defeat			1
he had lost the presidency on a november night in 1960 , then won it on november nights in 1968 and 1972			0
he might well have assumed that the defeats of his life were all past tense			0
and then came the resignation at the height of the @entity108 crisis in august of 1974			0
he was defiant -- proudly so -- in not wanting to be seen as actively seeking sympathy			1
" i never wanted to be buddy - buddy , " he said			0
" not only with the press			0
i do n't believe in letting your hair down , confessing this and that and the other thing -- saying , ' @entity118 , i could n't sleep , because i was worrying about this or that			1
' i believe you should keep your troubles to yourself			0
news : if @entity85 wins ... " that 's just the way i am			1
some people think it 's good therapy to sit with a close friend and , you know , just spill your guts ... so perhaps the younger generation should go in every time they are asked how they feel about this or that , and they should reveal their inner psyche -- whether they were breast - fed , or bottle - fed. " not me			1
" the first president @entity9 , in talking about the pain of losing to @entity141 in 1992 , also bristled at the memory of being expected to reveal to the public his private feelings : " i did n't feel comfortable with all this ' @entity144 ' and @entity145 , " he said			1
he imitated the voice of a hard - bitten political adviser : " ' @entity150 has been on @entity145 , you got ta show ' em you can communicate with the youth			0
' i kept being told ... " he let his voice trail off			1
@entity47 , recalling his 1980 loss to @entity153 , told me : " so , yeah -- i think there is a lot of misapprehension about who a person is , even when he 's being looked at all the time			1
... a lot of the reporters who almost sort of condemned everything i 'd done and said , and they were insinuating that i did n't have any intelligence , i did n't have any judgment , i did n't have any moral convictions ... i mean , it was n't unanimous , but it was there			1
and even the reporters who were most negative about me , in my post-presidential years they have said , ' wow , this guy has finally listened to what i said about him as president , and he 's changed his ways now , he 's got a little bit of sense , a little bit of judgment			1
... ' " opinion : stand up for centrist candidates @entity47 laughed , with more than a hint of harshness			2
" i do n't think i 've changed , " he said			2
on tuesday night , the man who loses will have to assure his supporters that he and his family will be just fine			2
@entity188 told me that her husband , after his defeat , did his level best to give that impression			1
" he really did try to be very stoic in his face , " she said			0
" he told us that there always has to be a winner and there always has to be a loser , and that you should n't be in politics if you are n't aware of that			1
we did n't talk a lot about it , because there was no sense in dwelling on it			2
we both felt pretty terrible			0
but we could n't change it			2
" the real anguish tuesday night will take place behind closed doors			0
in the 1972 election , @entity214 , who died last month at the age of 90 , was wiped out by @entity95			1
@entity214 's press secretary , a novelist and former @entity220 reporter named @entity221 , later recalled what it was like to be in @entity214 's hotel room that evening as @entity214 was , line by line , editing his concession speech : " his eyes welled over and a tear fell that was so large it splashed when it struck the top of his hand			2
a terrible sound came from him that was like a giggle except that it was as much a sob as a giggle			0
he said : ' i do n't know why i do that when i 'm sad -- why i laugh			2
' he moved quickly toward the bathroom			0
[ @entity214 's wife ] @entity240 , beginning to cry again , said : ' @entity9 always does that			2
he always laughs when he feels most badly			0
... ' " they are not just names and moving images on millions upon millions of smart phone screens , these people who ask us to make them our president			0
and one of them , on one november night every four years , finds out what it is like to be told : sorry			2
we 've decided to go with someone else			0
opinion : @entity254 -- it 's the losing campaigns i remember most the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			1

@entity260 : candidates who lose a presidential race have deep , if *unexpressed* , feelings
he says many challengers lose , but losing incumbents he 's talked to also had complex emotions
@entity24 said it was n't his nature to *outwardly* *lament* defeat ; @entity95 defiant , not seeking sympathy
@entity260 : someone wins , someone loses ; it 's painful to be told by voters : you 're not the one
