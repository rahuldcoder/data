speaking through tears , the former @entity24 host detailed the progression of his illness and the symptoms he suffered			1
@entity1 said he struggled to remember names , faces and conversations			2

" while i was at @entity24 , the pain would get so bad that my camera crew , our executive producer @entity38 and i , had worked out hand signals so they would know when to take the camera off of me , " @entity1 said			2
" we did n't know at the time what was causing me to feel as though , out of nowhere , my hands and feet , or arms and legs would feel like someone had just crushed them , set them on fire or pushed broken glass into them			0
" @entity1 said he rarely slept , but was never tired			2
after taking a test for people with traumatic brain injury and testing in the bottom 10 % , @entity1 said he was told he would no longer be able to function in about five to 10 years			1
