after months of delays , a " @entity1 " conference meant to broker an end to the @entity5 civil war has been scheduled to begin on january 22 in @entity1 , @entity6 , the @entity7 said monday morning			1
" at long last and for the first time , the @entity5 government and opposition will meet at the negotiation table rather than the battlefield , " @entity7 @entity8 ban ki - moon said during a news conference			1
he added that the goal of the conference includes " the establishment , based on mutual consent , of a transitional governing body with full executive powers , including over military and security entities			0
" while he dubbed the @entity7 - brokered meeting a " mission of hope " and called on both sides to cease violence and release detainees in preparation for the talks , he did not say which parties will attend -- a subject that helped push back the conference for months			1
@entity34 , the @entity7 and @entity35 special envoy to @entity5 , echoed @entity8 's sentiments in a later statement to reporters in @entity1			1
in regard to the release of detainees , @entity34 specifically mentioned two bishops who were abducted earlier this year , asking , " why are they still kept ? " @entity46 , the @entity48 bishop of @entity45 , and @entity49 , the @entity51 orthodox metropolitan of @entity45 and @entity52 , were abducted at gunpoint in april while en route to @entity45 , the @entity44 says			0
while @entity8 declined to answer questions regarding his statement or elaborate on which opposition groups would attend , @entity34 said later that the government and rebels have been asked to name their delegations by the end of the year			1
in response to questions , @entity34 said @entity64 and @entity65 could be " possible participants " at @entity67 more specifically on @entity64 , he said , " i do n't think i can comment on that			1
i think we said several times that the secretary general of the @entity7 and the secretary general of the @entity35 are in favor of inviting @entity64			1
" he added , " not all the people who want to come to @entity1 will be able to come , but they should know this is not an event			0
and in this process , i 'm sure that everybody who wants to participate in rebuilding what i call the new republic of @entity5 will be able to do so in the course of the process			2
" the conference would bring representatives from @entity5 's government and elements of the opposition to negotiate an end to the fighting that has wracked @entity5 since march 2011			1
yet the opposition is hardly a single group ; it consists of numerous factions that often oppose each other			1
the @entity94 - linked groups @entity95 in @entity96 and @entity97 have made substantial gains in @entity5 in recent months , especially in the north , tilting the balance away from more moderate factions of the rebel @entity102			2
@entity5 's brutal war within a war gains momentum the conference had been held up in part because many branches of the @entity5 opposition said they would n't attend , or would n't participate without preconditions			1
nineteen largely @entity112 rebel groups , for example , last month flatly rejected participating			0
some groups wanted @entity5 president @entity115 to step down before talks			2
" the conflict in @entity5 has raged for too long			2
it would be unforgivable not to seize this opportunity to bring an end to the suffering and destruction it has caused , " the @entity7 said in an online statement monday morning			0
@entity94 advancing in @entity5 , one town at a time @entity125 , a spokesman for @entity7 @entity8 ban ki - moon , declined to say monday who has guaranteed they will attend			2
but he said : " given how long it has taken to get to this point , " just the setting of a date " is a good sign			0
" @entity1 is a successor to @entity135 , a june 2012 meeting in which international parties laid out a peace plan for @entity5 that calls for a transitional governing body			2
it left open the question of whether @entity115 must leave power			0
the @entity143 and @entity144 announced in may that they would try to bring the warring parties to a second conference in @entity1 to implement the plan			0
but the second @entity1 conference was delayed several times			2
in november , the state - run @entity149 reported that @entity5 government officials would attend the conference without preconditions and with the goal of stopping violence in the country			1
the @entity5 conflict began in march 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the @entity161 movement			1
it is now a full - blown civil war			0
the @entity7 estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict , and another 9 million have been displaced			0
international inspectors , meanwhile , are trying to ensure that @entity5 eliminates its chemical weapons stockpile by the middle of 2014			0
@entity5 agreed to do so under international pressure earlier this year			0
more than 11,000 @entity5 children killed in civil war rebels : @entity5 airstrikes kill at least 40			0

envoy says @entity64 and @entity65 could be " possible participants "
conference had been delayed several times , in part over who would attend
@entity5 opposition contains numerous factions , some opposed to each other
conference aims to end violence that has raged since march 2011
