" i 'm in love with cities i 've never been to and people i 've never met			0
" it 's a quote that you may have seen online , attributed to best - selling author @entity7			1
the sentiment is certainly thought - provoking , but there 's one problem : @entity7 never wrote it			1
the writer , whose hit book " @entity13 " was made into a hit movie last summer , made the revelation in a @entity18 video he posted on tuesday , after only recently having realized what he said was a mistake			1
" when i saw the quote , i assumed it came from [ my book ] ' @entity24 , ' " he said			2
" people kept sourcing it as coming from ' @entity24			0
' " the quote originally popped up on the social network @entity28 , which like other social media is a haven of quotes , both real and not - so - real			1
because of what he says was a mistaken belief , @entity7 sold posters of the quote , attributing it to himself			1
he said he did not remember writing the line , but he does n't remember writing a lot of things he wrote years ago			0
in the video , he said , " instead of blindly assuming something i 'd written , something the @entity42 said i wrote , i should have done some research			0
" he was alerted to the fact on @entity47 , learning that a teenage fan of his , @entity48 , had come up with the quote in 2009 , and @entity7 was then given credit by many people online as the quote went viral over the years			1
@entity7 was upset that @entity53 was being accused of stealing his quote : " i 'm the thief ! " he proclaimed			1
( oddly enough , @entity7 said he determined he had never written the line after illegally downloading and digitally searching a copy of " @entity24 " for the quote			1
) @entity7 fell on his sword in the video , and added that internet culture as a whole is guilty of this sort of thing			1
" we do an epically bad job of acknowledging one another 's work and checking our sources			0
" @entity7 is retroactively paying royalties from sales of the posters to @entity53 , who learned about the quote being misattributed a few years ago , but did n't think much of it			1
" they were just little graphics with the quote on top of images , typical @entity28 stuff , " she said			0
once posters of the quote were sold , " i felt a bit hurt , " said @entity53 , who is now 18			2
@entity53 tried to reach out to @entity7 to no avail , but last week her friend posted about it to @entity47 and @entity7 responded			2
" i 'm still in a state of shock about the situation , actually , " she said			0
" i never expected any of this to happen			0
i 've always looked up to @entity7 as a role model			2
i know that if this happened to me with another person or company , nothing of this caliber would have occurred			0
he is the prime example of a wonderful person			0
" attempts to reach @entity7 through his publicist were not answered .			2
