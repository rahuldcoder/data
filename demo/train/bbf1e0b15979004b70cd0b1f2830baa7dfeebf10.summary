@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 for boys in northern @entity1 is anything but average			1
nestled amid the bucolic charm of the @entity0 's fertile terraced fields and steeply rising crags it looks idyllic			1
but if you get up close , a harsher reality becomes clear			0
two army check - posts scrutinize visitors entering the sprawling site			0
once inside , the high razor wire - topped walls around the classroom compounds create a feeling reminiscent of a prison			0
the boys here , aged 8 to 18 , were all militants at some point			2
some are killers , some helped build and plant improvised explosive devices , and others were destined to be suicide bombers until they were captured or turned over to the @entity1 army			2
all of them are at the school to be de-radicalized			0
ninety - nine percent of the boys , i am told , have never heard of @entity34 , despite the fact he was killed by @entity36 in the next valley over from here			0
what has radicalized these boys instead , the school 's director says , is what turns teenagers the world over to crime : poverty , poor education , limited prospects and often lack of parental control			2
it is in this setting that the boys have made ready recruits for @entity56 scouts who wean them on tales of the @entity59 drone strikes that have killed scores of @entity1 women and children over the past few years			1
exclusive : @entity63 admits to secret drone deals the walls of the school , i learn , are not so much to keep the boys in , but to keep the local @entity56 out			2
a few years ago they held sway in the @entity0 , and while the army has since reclaimed control , the militants remain a threat -- particularly for the teachers			1
the boys here are being schooled in basic math and literature			0
@entity80 and sports are also encouraged , as is art. physiologists evaluate the boys and offer council , and a religious scholar is attempting to draw them away from extremist ideology and back towards mainstream @entity87			0
for @entity1 it is a new approach to radicalism that has been forged out of necessity			0
the director tells me the need for more resources in @entity0 is huge			0
just a few days before our visit , a dozen more child militants were arrested by @entity1 officials			2
the @entity99 on drones , @entity102 lawyer @entity101 , recently visited @entity1 and told me : " the consequence of drone strikes has been to radicalize an entirely new generation			1
" read more : @entity59 drone program by the numbers in early march he spent close to a week in @entity1 meeting government officials and tribal leaders , some of who claim to have lost family members in strikes			1
since 2003 there have been more than 350 drone strikes in @entity1 , but no one has a reliable figure for precisely how many have been killed			1
the @entity120 estimates that in @entity1 , drones have killed between 1,953 and 3,279 people since 2004 -- and that between 18 % and 23 % of them were not militants			1
the nonmilitant casualty rate was down to about 10 % in 2012 , the group says			0
a study by the @entity127 estimates that since 2004 , @entity1 has had 365 drone strikes that have killed between 2,536 and 3,577 people -- including 411 to 884 civilians			1
@entity59 president @entity131 has maintained the strikes are necessary for defeating @entity133 and the @entity56 , but others including @entity101 have their doubts			2
read more : @entity59 drone kills 4 , @entity1 sources say he said : " through the use of drones you may win the immediate battle you are waging against this particular faction or that particular faction ... but you are losing the war in the longer term			1
" @entity101 's legal insights will form the basis of his report to the @entity150 , expected later this year			1
for the @entity59 , at least , it could make for a damning read			0
@entity101 says the drone strikes are illegal under international law as they violate @entity1 's sovereignty and fly in the face of @entity1 government calls for them to desist -- and that they also legalize @entity133 's fight against @entity59			1
he said : " if it is lawful for the @entity59 to drone @entity133 associates whereever they find them , then it is also lawful for @entity133 to target @entity59 military or infrastructure where ever ( militants ) find them			1
" until now the @entity59 has used its own lawyers to give legitimacy to the covert war being waged by drones			0
now @entity101 believes it is time to challenge them			0
" there is a real risk that by promulgating the analysis that is currently being developed and relied up by the @entity59 they legitimize , in international law , @entity133 , by turning it in to an armed belligerent involved in a war and that makes the use of force by @entity133 and its associates lawful , " he told me			0
the boys of @entity3 are at the sharp end of the drone debate and are living with its consequences			2
and in the relative safety of these classrooms , there 's little doubt change is long overdue			0
drones killing innocent @entity1 , @entity150 official says			1

@entity3 in @entity1 's @entity0 works to de-radicalize local youth
