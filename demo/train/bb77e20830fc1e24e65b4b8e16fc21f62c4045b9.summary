@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 president @entity3 arrived in the northern @entity1 city of @entity0 to a scorching spring day , and a distinctly chilly reception			1
@entity3 , in @entity1 with other world leaders for @entity10 talks , stepped off his flight from @entity12 to be greeted by @entity1 's deputy defense secretary , a junior minister in prime minister @entity15 's cabinet			1
standing nearby was a much bigger political personage , @entity1 attorney - general @entity17			2
@entity17 made no attempt to greet the @entity4 leader			1
not long after , though , @entity17 was filmed enthusiastically welcoming @entity21 's @entity20 and @entity23 president @entity22			0
if @entity3 had seen the local @entity25 newspaper in the short limousine trip to his hotel he would have noticed a giant front page graphic of a @entity4 bear complete with fur cap , matching up to a boxing kangaroo , above the headline " @entity33			2
" inside , splashed across two pages , was quote after quote from @entity15 , revealing details of his 20 - minute conversation with @entity3 on the sidelines of the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) meeting in @entity42 last week			0
@entity15 said he told @entity3 that he should stop trying to " recreate the lost glories of tsarism or the @entity45 , " and he accused @entity4 of stepping up its aggression , which was part of a " regrettable pattern			2
" @entity3 is clearly an isolated figure by @entity51 leaders in particular at the two - day @entity10 , after reports that @entity4 troops and heavy weapons are being sent across the @entity4 border to separatist rebels in eastern @entity57			1
@entity59 prime minister @entity58 warned @entity4 on friday to change its course regarding @entity57			1
otherwise , he said , " the relationship that @entity59 has with @entity4 , that the @entity62 has with @entity4 , the relationship that i hope @entity1 has with @entity4 , will be very different			1
" and @entity1 continues to show its anger towards @entity4 over the downing of @entity67 , which claimed the lives of 28 @entity1 citizens when the plane went down over @entity57			1
add to that a flotilla of four @entity4 naval vessels off the coast of @entity1 , and tensions in @entity0 are running pretty high			1
@entity3 for his part remains unrepentant , and apparently unruffled			0
he told the @entity4 news agency in an interview on the eve of the saturday and @entity10 that sanctions against @entity4 are against the principle of the @entity83 and undermine " the whole system of international economic relations			2
" that is unlikely to cut much ice here			0
@entity57 is not officially on the agenda but it looms large over this gathering			0
the summit brings together the leaders of the @entity92 , @entity59 , @entity21 and @entity93 -- countries that have been leading the sanctions against @entity4			2
the @entity10 is a grouping whose job is actually to focus on financial and economic matters			0
indeed , the stated aims of host @entity1 is to launch a new road map to boost global economic growth by two percentage points above the existing targets by 2018 , mainly through infrastructure spending , streamlined financial services , and a crackdown on tax laws			0
but that 's playing second fiddle to a real - time diplomatic drama unfolding in @entity0			0
the heat is on , and it 's not just the unseasonably warm weather .			0
