-- " my mama always said you 've got to put the past behind you before you can move on			0
" @entity6 words were never spoken , mr. gump			0
but this summer , we 've been ignoring @entity10 's sage advice and looking back at summers past in search of a little nostalgic kick			2
first , we revisited the " freedom summer " of ' 64 , then the " me " summer of ' 74 and finally the totally tubular summer of ' 84			0
now , as the end of the season draws near , let 's revisit some of the most notable moments from 20 years ago , the summer of 1994			1
inspirational movies reigned supreme , electro - pop and boy bands ruled the radio , and the " @entity25 " was the talk of the country			1
here 's more on the summer that was : blockbusters and summer 1994 were like peas and carrots " @entity36 " taught moviegoers young and old about the circle of life via the coming - of - age adventure of a young lion cub named @entity35			1
with a little musical help from his friends , a warthog , a meerkat and @entity42 , the movie became a roaring multiplatform success : after its june 15 release , the animated musical earned multiple @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 nominations and was the highest - grossing film worldwide that year			2
meanwhile , the domestic box office was dominated by a simple man			1
his name ? @entity54 , @entity55			1
that summer , we also met " @entity61 " in a live - action film that was received poorly by critics but ran the box office for several weekends after its may 27 release date			1
thirty - two writers famously worked on the script , but one key line still remained : yabba - dabba - doo ! " @entity68 " was another sssssmokin ' late - summer hit : the slapstick comedy starring @entity70 and @entity71 made more than $ 23 million on its opening weekend of july 29			2
and no summer movie season is complete without an action film -- or three : " @entity74 , " " @entity75 " and " @entity76 " all screeched onto the big screen in the summer of ' 94			0
soulful and @entity79 tunes @entity79 pop group @entity80 showed no signs of stopping with two hits that summer : " @entity83 " and " do n't turn around			0
" listeners swore by the soulful harmonies of @entity86 's " i swear , " which dominated the @entity90 charts for 11 straight weeks			2
during the week of august 6 , the top spot went to " stay ( i missed you ) " by the bespectacled @entity93 after the song 's appearance in the post-grad film " @entity97			2
" @entity93 was usurped after three weeks by another all - male vocal group , @entity98 , and their single " @entity99			2
" meanwhile , @entity101 viewers were going " @entity108 " for @entity102 and @entity103 , who played two schoolgirls cutting class in @entity107 's music video			1
baseball players cry foul , and @entity111 fever @entity113 's @entity112 ended their 54 - year wait for the @entity115 with a defeat of the @entity117 in game seven of the finals on june 14 , 1994			1
three days later , on june 17 , legendary golfer @entity120 made his final appearance in the @entity122			0
@entity111 fever was at an all - time high in a notoriously soccer - averse nation : not only did the @entity125 play host nation with a cumulative attendance of 3,587,538 , but the home team advanced to the round of 16 for the first time since 1930 with the help of popular players like @entity133 and @entity134			1
as soccer fever cooled , @entity136 frustrations heated up			2
players went on strike august 12 over a proposed salary cap			0
they would strike for 232 days ; it was the first year without a @entity141 since 1904			0
summer of scandals -- and @entity144 speaking of the @entity111 , @entity146 player @entity145 was sent home early after he tested positive for the drug ephedrine			1
this was not the first time @entity145 faced drug trouble : the famed soccer player was suspended for 15 months by @entity153 in 1991 over alleged cocaine use			0
in a more tragic turn of events , @entity156 player @entity155 was gunned down in the streets on july 2 after accidentally scoring a goal for the @entity125 and ultimately eliminating his nation 's team			1
cartel bodyguard @entity163 confessed to the murder , but it is widely speculated that he did not act alone and was employed by a cartel that lost significant money betting on @entity156			0
in @entity169 , the tabloids were aflutter after the @entity170 admitted in a televised documentary to committing adultery with @entity173			0
the documentary was supposed to paint @entity170 in a sympathetic light after his very public separation from princess @entity176 after 11 years of marriage			0
and then , of course , there 's @entity144			1
on june 17 , 1994 , the @entity181 winner and @entity182 led police on a low - speed chase on @entity186 freeways after the killings of his ex-wife @entity188 and her friend @entity189			1
the now - legendary white @entity190 has been burned into the brains of the collective @entity125 audience , as the events unfolded on live television before 95 million viewers			1
@entity188 would be charged and found not guilty of murder			0
and that 's all we have to say about that .			0

twenty years ago , the @entity125 played host to soccer 's @entity111
" @entity55 " and " @entity36 " reigned supreme at the box office
@entity144 led police on a low - speed chase through @entity186
