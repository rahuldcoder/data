-- can you really go home again ? " @entity7 " is just the latest to trade on our love of nostalgia by revisiting a past hit			1
" @entity16 " debuted in 1994 and the combination of the @entity10 brothers as directors and stars @entity13 and @entity14 was cinema gold			1
the film went on to become a cult classic			1
but is it possible to recapture that type of magic 20 years later ? after all , these days @entity14 is more well known for his dramatic role on @entity24 's " @entity23 " and neither he nor @entity13 are as young as they used to be			1
so far critics have n't found a lot of evidence that the pair can go home again in terms of replicating what made the first film beloved ( and yes we remember the 1995 animated tv show " @entity36 " and the 2003 movie prequel " @entity38 " )			2
" the charm of the original , to the extent that the original was an enjoyable character farce that led to better things for all participants , is long gone , " writes @entity39 for @entity40			2
" this is not the ' @entity7 ' sequel we needed , but it 's the one we deserved for inexplicably clamoring for a second installment in the first place			1
" @entity53 of @entity54 writes " sporadically very funny , mostly very tedious , and sometimes truly vile , this 18 - years - too - late sequel nonetheless exhibits a certain puerile purity of purpose , and should accrue healthy profits playing to the nostalgia of the dumb and the dumb at heart			1
" but good or bad , @entity61 will always return to the well be it with television or movies in the hopes that they can rally those who have held on to their fond memories for years			1
here are a few examples			2
" @entity70 " fans loved this former tv show so much that they helped fund a movie just to catch up with the characters			2
the series about a teenaged private detective ended in 2007 but the " @entity70 " motion picture landed in theaters in 2014 after a successful @entity80 campaign			2
it did n't break any records at the box office , but the faithful did n't seem to care			2
" @entity85 " look up " cult classic " and " @entity85 " will be right there			2
the @entity88 ended in 2006 after three seasons of low ratings despite critical acclaim			0
@entity92 stepped up and made dreams come true in 2013 with a fourth season			0
word is there are plans for a season 5			0
" @entity99 " it took 23 years to get a sequel to the wildly popular 1960 horror film " @entity103			1
" original star @entity104 also appeared in the 1983 followup as the now - rehabilitated killer , @entity106			0
in 2013 @entity107 premiered a prequel series titled " @entity109			0
" @entity110 : @entity111 " the original " @entity110 " was released in 1982 , also known as the early days of @entity113 special effects			0
things had gotten much more advanced by the time " @entity110 : @entity111 " came out in 2010			0
sci - fi geeks were so ready for it and thrilled to see @entity117 reprise his role as software engineer @entity119 , whose son @entity120 ( played by @entity121 ) finds him in a virtual world 20 years later			1
" @entity123 " " @entity124 " practically owned the 1990s			0
the @entity126 series followed the exploits of @entity128 and his friends and family from 1993 to 2000 and viewers could n't get enough of the young love between @entity128 and his crush @entity134 ( played by @entity135 and @entity136 respectively )			0
many from the original cast were on board for the new series " @entity123 " which premiered in june 2014 and found @entity128 and @entity124 now married and the parents of a pre-teen daughter named @entity143			0
" @entity144 " no show has been more aptly named than this one			0
the @entity24 series about a washed - up tv actress desperate to get back into the game never gained traction and only lasted one season in 2005 despite a devoted fan base			0
over the years even more folks discovered the show within a show and there were cries to " bring back @entity144 " played by " friends " actress @entity158			1
that happened in november 2014 when the network brought it back years later for a second season			1
it just goes to show that it 's never too late			0
now who 's ready for the sequel to " zoolander ? "			1

" @entity7 ' is a sequel 20 years after the fact
the reviews have not been *great*
@entity61 loves to revisit old shows and movies
