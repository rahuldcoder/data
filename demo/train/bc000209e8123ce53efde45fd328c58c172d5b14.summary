-- thirty - nine years ago , @entity1 was decided			1
with the passage of nearly four decades , the landscape of abortion has changed in a way that should trouble even those who consider themselves pro-choice			1
right now , 10 states and the @entity9 have no statutory time limit on when abortions can be performed , while five more states allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester ( about 27 or 28 weeks )			1
yet , we know that by 28 weeks , the great majority of fetuses would survive birth			1
in other words , we allow the killing of viable infants in our country			1
this is a fact that progressives ( including me ) would rather not address			0
as two @entity28 abortion doctors face murder charges for allegedly performing late - term abortions , the issue now has a pair of human faces			1
drs. @entity33 and @entity34 were arrested after the discovery of what are alleged to be several viable fetuses in a freezer chest			1
the story only got stranger on @entity41 , when a clinic apparently owned by @entity43 burned to the ground in @entity45			0
important facts are still unknown , and the doctors have asserted their innocence regarding any late - term abortions			0
there has been relatively little discussion of this case in progressive circles			0
it 's no wonder that we would rather look away			0
the abortion debate has largely devolved into professional activists screaming at each other on television and at street protests			1
we do n't want to be like those people			0
we are also haunted by the ragged remains of the @entity64 opinion in @entity1			1
despite being disavowed by subsequent opinions and some of the individual justices , one part of that precedent lives on in the statutes of some states and the practices of several doctors : the assertion in @entity1 's majority opinion that " viability is usually placed at about seven months ( 28 weeks )			1
" the scientific claim that viability ( the ability of a fetus to live outside the womb ) " usually " occurs at 28 weeks has been undermined by medical advances over the past 38 years			1
children who would have died if born late in the second trimester in 1973 would more than likely live if they were born now			2
a @entity85 study in 2009 found that preterm babies born late in the second trimester who are given intensive care survive at surprising rates : 53 % of those born at 23 weeks live , 67 % at 24 weeks , and by 25 weeks , 82 % of the babies survive			2
( @entity85 's health care system makes it possible to reliably track survival rates , but the type of care provided there is similar to that available in the @entity97 )			2
in the same way that the law had to change to accommodate advances in dna evidence that can exonerate those on death row , state laws must change to accommodate that with modern medical care , a child born at 27 weeks is very likely not only going to live , but live a fairly normal life			2
we progressives tend to revere science , and there are few scientific proofs more convincing than those former preterm infants who live and thrive all around us			0
though late - term abortions are only a small fraction of the total number of terminated pregnancies , it remains a defining issue for our society			0
as someone who works against the death penalty , trying to save the lives of people who have committed murder , i have a moral obligation to set my feet , breathe in deeply and honestly admit that prosecutors are morally in the right to pursue cases where they believe viable fetuses are being aborted in violation of the law			1
a life is ended , and that is murder , if the facts so prove			0
some will see any accommodation on abortion as " appeasement " of conservatives , but this attitude is nothing less than the adoption of hard - line evidence - ignoring tactics that progressives so often ( and properly ) decry in groups such as the @entity149			2
we may disagree about whether life begins at conception , but it is now irrefutable that life is viable at 27 weeks			2
to deny this plainly observable fact is akin to denying the existence of evolution or global warming			0
much as @entity160 ( who was executed in @entity162 last year despite troubling exculpatory evidence ) and @entity164 ( who received a stay of his execution in @entity167 to allow dna testing to be pursued ) personified the problems with the death penalty , there are those who do so just as starkly when we ponder late - term abortion			2
for me , that person is named @entity175			0
on a hot summer day in @entity178 , @entity167 , his proud grandfather carried him across the street for me to meet , months after his birth at about 24 weeks			0
his eyes were clear in the @entity167 sun , he was wrapped in a blue - and - white blanket , and he was surrounded by love			0
he was , and is , a person , and that matters as much as @entity160 and @entity164			0
follow @entity187 on @entity188 join the conversation on @entity190 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			1

@entity193 : *39* years after @entity1 , time limits on abortion should be *rethought*
some states have no statutory time limit ; others allow abortion up to the end of second trimester
@entity193 says medical *technology* makes some fetuses viable in second trimester
