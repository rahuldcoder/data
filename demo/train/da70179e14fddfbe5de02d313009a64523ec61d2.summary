@entity0 -- it should have been a happy day for @entity3 : he had been accepted to college , with scholarships to help pay for it			2
but when he told his parents , his mother started to cry			2
" i was puzzled why she was crying after hearing such great news , " said @entity3 , who was to attend @entity11 in @entity12			2
" that was when she started to explain to me we were undocumented , that we had overstayed our tourist visas			1

as this year 's immigration reform efforts began , @entity39 - @entity19 advocacy groups laid out their priorities to the @entity56 negotiating a bill in the @entity58 , along with other key legislators like house speaker @entity60 and minority leader @entity61			1
their priorities in the immigration debate include establishing a humane pathway to citizenship , restricting the use of electronic employment verification systems such as @entity68 and reducing visa backlogs			2
the groups are also trying to fight efforts to increase the number of business - related visas at the expense of those that allow immigrants to join resident family in the @entity19 and change the policy of deportations for minor offenses			1
the @entity82 , based in @entity0 , has been focused on family visas			0
" @entity89 and others have been very public on eliminating the married adult children category and brother - sister category , " @entity84 , president and executive director , said of the @entity87 senator from @entity88			2

springtime for immigration reform ? the law has severely affected the @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 communities , @entity125 said			1
" it is a complicated question but has a good deal to do with issues with refugee resettlement issues in the ' 80s			0
many were dealing with mental health issues from the ( @entity153 ) war			0
almost all @entity142 refugees had lost a relative in the genocide , and many had seen relatives killed or starved to death			0
" post-traumatic stress disorder and depression rates among @entity142 refugees are over 80 % , @entity125 said			2
" yet mental health services were n't available when they arrived			2
most were resettled in neighborhoods with high unemployment and poverty rates along with drugs and high incarceration rates			0
in the absence of a strong family support structure , many joined gangs when they were in high school and picked up convictions			0
" @entity125 wants more discretion when dealing with deportation cases rather than having someone 's fate decided simply by a look at their convictions			0
" these are actual people with names and stories and families , " @entity125 said , " and it 's our job to make sure their voices get heard			0
" the @entity190 - based @entity189 has also been meeting with legislators and organizing @entity39 to talk with their congressmen about issues like immigration			1
the institute has been collecting and posting personal stories from @entity39			1
for example , @entity197 wants to bring her son from the @entity20 to live with her in the @entity19 " applications where her son 's is categorized normally take 11 - 12 years , " @entity197 's story says			1
" in the interim they have tried to spend every @entity205 together for the past 8 years since @entity197 came to the @entity19			1
it 's a form of bonding ; a pact that only gets more painful and emotional every goodbye time -- and expensive			0
" as for @entity3 , he 's making do , whatever ultimately happens in @entity0			0
