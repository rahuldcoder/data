if the concept of being awakened by a complete stranger sounds good to you , as opposed to , say , creepy or disconcerting , then @entity0 is the app for you			1
originally launched in 2011 , @entity0 has finally made its way to the @entity8 's @entity7 , after a reported nine - month wait			1
it 's also available for @entity12 and @entity13 phones and , according to the company , already has 1.5 million users in 80 countries			2
they call it the " social alarm clock " and " a friendly community of people who wake each other up in the morning			2
" and the concept is that simple			0
if you set an alarm through the app at , say , 6 a.m. you 'll get a call from another user waking you up when that time comes			2
likewise , if you 're in the mood to be the waker , not the wakee , ( " @entity34 " and " @entity35 " in the app 's parlance ) you can go to the app , see how many people are ready to rise and shine and click to be the person who delivers the news			1
connections are made through the app and no one ever sees another user 's phone number			1
the length of a call is limited to one minute , and users are encouraged to sing songs , tell jokes , recite poems or use otherwise creative ways to kickstart their slumbering community members ' days			0
if no " wakies " are on the app when you 've set an alarm , @entity0 sends you an automated robo - call to do the job			1
it 's worth noting that , on the app 's social feed , it 's not uncommon to see folks who have awakened to the sound of a stranger 's voice trying to track down that stranger , or vice versa			1
so that 's all well and good			2
but ... why ? why get a stranger to wake you up instead of , you know , an alarm			1
" a lot of people keep snoozing alarm clocks and still ca n't wake up , " @entity73 , @entity74 's ceo and co-founder , told @entity76			1
" our research shows that a one - minute talk to a stranger wakes your brain up with a 99 % guarantee			0
when someone asks you questions in the morning your brain has to wake up to answer			0
also you try to be kind , you try to turn on your social pattern of behavior			0
after the call you ca n't sleep anymore even if you had a short sleep			0
" but what about the creep factor ? is there anything stopping someone from calling up and being abusive or rude ? there are in - app tools to report abuse , but @entity73 says it 's never really been a problem			2
wakie is free , but there are plans for a premium version in the works			0
@entity73 told @entity76 that version may allow conversations up to five minutes , as well as letting users choose the gender of the person who calls them			0
which starts to sound a bit too much like a wakeup dating app to us -- though there are worse ways to have early morning chats with romantically minded strangers , we suppose .			0
