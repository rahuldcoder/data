@entity0 -- it 's hard to believe that this area of @entity0 was once a dilapidated and neglected quarter of the @entity6 capital			1
with shiny new stadiums and visitor facilities nestling among the lush landscaped grounds , every detail of the 500 - acre @entity8 has taken into account environmental concerns , prompting 2012 organizers to bill it as the first sustainable @entity15			1
@entity16 , head of sustainability for the @entity18 , was part of the original team that drafted @entity0 's successful bid			1
sustainability was a key reason why @entity0 was chosen , he says , and provides a golden opportunity to show what can be achieved			1
" if you can put sustainability at the heart of a project which is the largest logistical exercise in peace time -- across 26 different sports , with thousands of people attending and millions watching -- then you can do it anywhere , " @entity16 said			1
see more : @entity1 's aiming for gold many of the park 's bridges have been constructed using gabion walls ( steel mesh filled with stones and rubble ) providing a visual reminder of the @entity44 ' green goals			2
" there 's a huge emphasis on reuse and recycling , " says @entity16			1
" all the buildings that were knocked down , all that rubble was sort of crushed up and used as the fillings of these gabions for the new bridges			0
" the @entity55 and several canals which wend their way through the park used to be badly polluted , he says			0
today , after an intensive program of clearing and widening , wildlife is being encouraged to return			0
watch : @entity0 's new " @entity63 " " creating a shallower profile in the wetlands further up ( the river ) has allowed larger areas of wildlife habitat to be created			2
at the same time that 's providing flood mitigation benefits to thousands of properties in the local area , " @entity16 says			1
in addition to over 300,000 wetland plants , organizers have planted more than 4,000 trees and 130,000 plants and bulbs			0
" one of the key things about this site is how you 've got natural park lands as well as more formal gardens			0
unlike previous games people are going to really feel they are in a park , " @entity16 said			0
@entity0 2012 organizers are also proud of the park 's sporting arenas built for the @entity44			1
behind the velodrome 's timber - clad frame , cyclists will race for gold round a track made from sustainably - sourced @entity97 pine , while @entity100 's striking wave - shaped roof on the @entity101 has been temporarily adorned with " wings " providing seating for 15,000 spectators			0
" that 's great for the games , but after we 'll bring it down to 2,500 seats for legacy mode , as it turns into a facility for the local community , " he said			0
temporary seating and venues , like the 12,000 - seat @entity115 , will accommodate nearly 300,000 spectators during the games -- a figure without precedent at any previous @entity15 , according to organizers			2
all eyes will be on the @entity123 come the opening ceremony on july 27 with the 80,000 - seat arena being the sustainable centerpiece of the @entity44			2
constructed using just a tenth of the steel required to build @entity131 's " @entity130 " , the stadium weighs in at just 4,500 tons , becoming the lightest @entity123 ever built			0
parts of the tubular steel roof has been built using surplus gas pipelines , @entity16 says			0
he and his team have used recycled materials wherever possible , which is not only cheaper but also cuts carbon emissions and energy costs			0
the complexities of the addressing sustainability have been a constant challenge @entity16 says , but his efforts appear to have paid off			2
@entity0 2012 " can build the confidence to wider society that sustainability is not a theory but infinitely do - able , " said executive director of the @entity144 , @entity145 during a visit in april this year			1
" thrilled " at the results he and his team have managed to produce , @entity16 is hopeful the park will be attracting visitors long after the @entity15 has left town			1
" it 's not about two weeks ... it is what this site will be like 20 to 30 years down the road , " @entity16 said .			2
