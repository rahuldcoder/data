@entity0 -- just before @entity3 invoked her @entity4 right not to answer questions in front of a @entity8 committee investigating wrongdoing in the @entity11 tax - exempt office she ran , she gave an opening statement insisting her innocence			1
" i have not done anything wrong			0
i have not broken any laws			0
i have not violated any @entity11 rules and regulations , " said @entity3 at the hearing			1
she has since been placed on administrative leave			1
but that statement angered @entity24 @entity23 chairman @entity22 and others on the committee , causing him thursday to threaten to recall @entity3 and force her to answer his questions , believing she had , in fact , waived her constitutional rights			1
what it means to take ' @entity4 ' " she just testified			1
she just waived her @entity4 right to privilege , " @entity33 @entity32 rep. @entity32 , a former federal prosecutor , said to applause during wednesday 's hearing			1
" you do n't get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross-examination			0
that 's not the way it works			0
" after consulting with counsel , chairman @entity22 has concluded that ms. @entity3 's @entity4 assertion is no longer valid			1
she remains under subpoena , the @entity23 is looking at recalling her for testimony , " oversight committee spokeswoman @entity48 told @entity1 thursday in a statement			1
@entity22 's office declined to explain what his counsel 's legal basis was for deciding that her @entity4 assertion is no longer valid			2
but @entity57 and several legal experts think @entity22 was wrong			2
" i 'm surprised that chairman @entity22 's taken that position , " @entity60 @entity59 rep. @entity59 , @entity61 told @entity1 on thursday			2
" first , all the law that i 've read says that she did not waive her right			2
as a lawyer i do n't believe she waived her right			0
and i believe that we as a committee should honor one 's right , and as a matter of fact			0
" some legal experts agree			0
" the only true ways to " lose " one 's rights under the @entity4 are , one , for a court to find that the claimant does not have a reasonable fear of prosecution , because nothing she says could in fact become a helpful link to a prosecution , or two , to get an order of immunity that guarantees that nothing she says will in fact be used to prosecute her , " said @entity74 , a conservative attorney who helps head the law firm @entity75 's appellate and constitutional group and who was once nominated by president @entity79 to the @entity80			1
" the first is unlikely here , and no one is offering to do the second			0
" it is true that high - profile congressional hearings are equal parts official proceeding and political spectacle			0
and the very act of being called to testify before @entity107 can create an impression of guilt in the court of public opinion , even though the congressional panel is n't issuing any kind of legal ruling			0
in these instances , it might be best to show up with an attorney for the benefit of appearances for the folks back at home watching on television , but plead the " @entity4 " on sticky legal questions			2
but even in front of @entity107 , experts say , a witness does n't necessarily lose @entity4 protections by speaking first			1
" one can invoke the @entity4 at any time			2
giving a preamble or any kind of statement does n't void that , " said @entity127 , an associate professor who teaches constitutional law at @entity129 in @entity130			1
" now does it look suspicious ? yes			0
does it undermine the person 's credibility ? yes			0
" former @entity140 ceo @entity139 , former lobbyist @entity141 , retired lt. col. @entity142 , baseball player @entity143 and @entity146 crashers @entity144 and @entity147 all invoked @entity4 privilege before @entity107 due to concerns that anything they may have said could have been used against them in court			2
and , like @entity3 , many of them offered some type of statement before or after taking @entity4			1
" i think what she did was unconventional , " said @entity157 , a former federal prosecutor who now practices at the law firm @entity158			0
" but it 's hyper technical to say she waived her @entity4 privilege			1
" @entity1 's @entity163 and @entity164 contributed to this report .			0

*lawmakers* , constitutional *scholars* *debate* whether @entity169 waived the " @entity4 "
@entity24 , some attorneys say rights were waived when she gave statement of innocence
*democrats* , many constitutional law experts say right not to self - *incriminate* stands
@entity3 was placed on administrative leave thursday
