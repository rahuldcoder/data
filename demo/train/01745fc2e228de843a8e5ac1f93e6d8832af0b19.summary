@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 hunts the @entity0 beaches on the @entity5 of @entity1 almost every day			1
" beachcombing , or metal detecting , or relic hunting is in my blood , " said @entity3 , a retired government worker who hits the sand between october and april			1
" there are so many shipwrecks up here , it 's just beautiful			0
" @entity3 drives his pickup truck right onto the beach using the access road near the @entity17			1
with a metal detector and shovel in tow , he 's uncovered everything from antique coins to wedding rings			1
yet his biggest discovery came in december when he located the remains of a historic shipwreck			2
the wreckage , hidden under the sand for centuries , became fully exposed after a winter of brutal @entity31 , making it the oldest shipwreck found off the coast of @entity1			1
but historians had to act fast to recover the ship , according to @entity36 , site manager of the @entity17			2
" this winter , it just got smacked			2
after awhile the ocean was going to take it back , " @entity36 said			0
" the fact that we got it off the beach makes us excited because we got to save it			0
" @entity3 and other beachcombers had discovered a number of relics near the shipwreck 's beach grave site , including coins believed to be from the reign of @entity52 in @entity53 and @entity54 in @entity55 , lead bale seals used for identification , and spoons dating to the mid- 1600s			1
@entity3 said he feels a personal connection to the discovery			1
" this shipwreck is a part of me , and some of the other hunters , too , that have been hunting around it for years , " @entity3 said			1
" i 'm just so glad that they decided to save it			0
" the rough currents and shallow sand bars off @entity1 's @entity5 have destroyed thousands of ships in what is sometimes called the " graveyard of the @entity72			0
" however , it is rare to find the remains of a shipwreck -- particularly a wooden vessel -- intact			2
throughout winter , the @entity0 beach shipwreck would repeatedly get uncovered and covered again			1
the waves would also move it along the coastline , causing damage			0
" i 'm glad we got to it when we did			0
... it may have covered back up and survived another summer , " @entity3 said			1
" but next winter it would have been the same thing over and it eventually would have gone to pieces			2
" @entity3 , who used to work as a government auditor , wanted to make sure his discovery was salvaged , so he personally lobbied @entity1 state sen. @entity89			1
after numerous phone calls and e-mails appealing to @entity89 , a beach lover himself , he was successful			2
in april , volunteers from the @entity94 , @entity95 , the @entity96 and area residents helped free the wreck from the sand and tow it near the lighthouse			0
archaeologists originally thought the wreck could be the @entity103 , a @entity106 @entity105 ship from the late 18th century that originally ran around in the southern @entity107 off @entity109 's coast			0
the @entity103 drifted to the @entity5 , where it was looted once it hit shore , then disabled by the looters so it would n't resurface			0
after further examination of the ship 's 12 - ton skeleton -- complete with wooden peg fasteners -- archaeologists determined that it was not the @entity103 , but most likely a merchant 's ship dating to the mid- to late - 1600s			0
that makes it the oldest shipwreck found along the state 's coast			1
" history is the one thing we have that has a reasonable amount of certainty attached to it , " said @entity128 , director of @entity129			0
" it tells us where we 've been , it tells us what 's happening , and it 's a directional sign for where you need to go next			0
" before the @entity142 discovery , the oldest shipwreck found along the state 's coast was @entity144 , the presumed flagship of @entity146 the pirate said to have run aground in 1718 , according to the @entity129			1
the remains of the @entity142 wreck and some of its artifacts will be moved to the @entity152 on @entity153 , @entity1			0
@entity3 and the other beachcombers are entitled to keep the coins and other artifacts found near the ship they discovered			1
" it 's very exciting to find something from this time period , " said @entity159 , director of the @entity1 @entity95 for the @entity160			0
" and amazingly we found it in this beach environment			0
it appears this wreck has been sitting here for 350 years almost undisturbed until this winter			1
" @entity159 said the discovery would never have happened without @entity3			2
" @entity3 was probably more responsible than anybody to get this wreck off the beach , " @entity159 said			1
" he created enough of a stir to get various organizations involved			0
" @entity177 , @entity3 and his colleagues collected various artifacts that would have otherwise not survived			2

@entity3 finds shipwreck while on his regular beachcombing route
he and other beachcombers had found numerous coins and other items from the wreck

@entity3 lobbies a state senator to get wreck removed so it could be studied and preserved
