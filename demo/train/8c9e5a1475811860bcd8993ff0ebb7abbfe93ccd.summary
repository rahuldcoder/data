@entity0 -- @entity4 gov. @entity3 signed into law a measure that will allow undocumented immigrant students to receive privately funded scholarships administered at public universities and community colleges , officials said tuesday			1
the law was needed because the @entity12 and @entity13 systems avoided giving the private scholarships to their undocumented students , citing vagueness in laws , said @entity18 , legislative aide to the new law 's author , assemblyman @entity19			1
also , community colleges in @entity4 often raised money from private sources and diverted those funds to independent nonprofit groups , which in turn gave those funds as scholarships to undocumented students , @entity18 told @entity1 on tuesday			1
under the new law , community colleges will be able to give those privately financed scholarships directly to undocumented immigrant students , @entity18 said			1
since 2005 , bills containing an identical measure were vetoed four times by gov. @entity36 , a @entity37 , but on monday , @entity3 , a @entity38 , ceremoniously signed the law on the back of @entity19 , who has long championed the proposal , @entity18 said			0
@entity19 , @entity41 - @entity0 , told @entity1 on tuesday that the new law will help boost the @entity4 labor force with educated workers , especially as a million college graduates who are baby boomers are projected to retire by 2025			2
he also said " thousands " of undocumented students will now be able to achieve their personal dreams			0
" education is for life , but their legal status will change , " @entity19 said of the undocumented immigrant students			1
" something is going to happen that their status is going to change " some day , he added			0
the new law is called @entity4 's @entity57			2
it differs from a proposed federal bill called the @entity60 -- or @entity61 -- @entity57 , which would create a path to citizenship for immigrants who entered the @entity65 illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the @entity65 for at least five years , obtained a high school or general education development diploma and demonstrated " good moral character , " according to a @entity72 fact sheet			0
" signing this @entity57 is another investment in people , " @entity3 said at monday 's signing			0
@entity76 , executive director for the @entity77 , a regional immigrant rights organization , praised the new law			0
" while many states have chosen to legislate hate and division by approving anti-immigrant laws , @entity4 's governor sends a strong message that investing in today 's student population , regardless of their immigration status , is smart , practical , and the right thing to do , " @entity78 said in a written statement			2
the law requires undocumented immigrant students to have attended a @entity4 high school for three or more years , to have attained a diploma or a ged , to have filed an affidavit with the college stating they have applied for a lawful immigration status or will apply as soon as they are eligible to do so , @entity18 said			1
the new law also applies to citizen or resident students who may have left the state and want to return to a @entity4 higher education institution ; they too have to meet the same high school attendance and diploma or ged criteria , @entity18 said			2
the @entity12 system 's 10 campuses have about 670 undocumented students who could benefit under the new law , @entity18 said			0
the @entity12 system has a total enrollment of 237,000 , according to a @entity19 statement			0
figures for undocumented immigrant students in the @entity13 and community college systems were n't available , @entity18 said			1
@entity19 has also introduced a @entity115 , which would allow undocumented immigrant students to receive state - funded financial aid at higher education institutions , @entity18 said			1
that measure , which passed the @entity119 in june , is scheduled for a vote in the @entity121 on august 25 , @entity18 said .			0

public colleges in @entity4 have raised funds for private scholarships
but the private scholarships did not go directly to undocumented immigrant students
a new law now allows for the award of such privately financed scholarships
