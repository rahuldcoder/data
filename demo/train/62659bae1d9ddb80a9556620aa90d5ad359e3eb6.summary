@entity0 , a group that plans to send humans on a one - way trip to @entity4 , has announced its final 100 candidates			1
they have been selected from 200,000 applicants and will go on to further testing later this year , which they expect to include team - building exercises and later , isolation			2
eventually , 24 will be selected to make up six crews of four , which @entity0 says they hope to launch to the @entity4 every two years from 2024 , with the aim of starting a colony there			1
the @entity17 non-profit hopes to use existing technology to carry out the mission			2
however , the planet has always been a difficult target for exploration , with only around half of all unmanned missions succeeding			2
the journey itself is expected to take around seven months , and a recent @entity28 study found that , should the first explorers succeed in landing , using current technology they would likely survive just 68 days			2
so what kind of person chooses to go to @entity4 on a one - way mission ? the list of 100 finalists includes scientists and academics as well as those who are just seeking the ultimate adventure			1
we spoke to two of the @entity43 hopefuls			2
for @entity45 , a chemistry graduate , who currently works as a secondary school lab technician , it is a lifelong passion for space that led to her decision to apply			1
" i have always been interested in space ; i grew up in the 80s watching shuttle launches , but always used to think that space travel was just for the @entity53			2
when the opportunity came up i had to put my name forward			2
" but she admits that not everyone has been happy with her decision to apply , and the risks associated			0
" generally the reaction has been overwhelmingly positive from my friends and family since i told them i was down to the final 100 , but it 's going to be difficult for my mum			1
i have n't told her yet , " she says			0
@entity45 explains that when she first applied in 2013 , her mum told her she did n't want her to go as she knew she would be selected and that she would never see her daughter again			1
" i am very divided by it , but the way i see it , i have a responsibility to more people , " @entity45 says			1
she believes that the whole purpose of the mission is to inspire a new generation and that she has a responsibly to those who come after her			0
and she is unfazed by those who claim the whole idea is improbable : " @entity76 are always ridiculed , but i am doing this for something better , which will hopefully benefit more people than just staying at home and keeping my mum happy			1
" opinion : how will space explorers cope with isolation ? it is this sense of responsibility and passion for the plans which drove @entity45 through her selection process			1
her initial video application included a speech she had rehearsed several times , talking about how @entity0 is all about doing something for the greater good			1
she also had to take a standard medical examination and then a 15 - minute interview , where @entity45 was quizzed on past @entity4 missions and plans for @entity0			1
she succeeded in answering every question correctly			0
as for the risk -- " of course i am scared , " she says			0
" it 's something that has never been done before , it 's a leap into the unknown			0
when people ask me why i am going to @entity4 to die , i say we are all going to die , but it 's important what you do before you die			1
" " i applied because it is the ultimate opportunity , " explains @entity108 , a 27 - year - old manager who describes herself as somebody who does n't want to lead the ordinary " nine - to - five " kind of life			0
" i want to be able to go down in history , " she says			0
" i want to be able to say i made a difference to the future of mankind			0
" @entity108 does n't have a background in science , but says she is driven by the challenge			0
it 's an aspiration shared by her family : @entity108 's brother also applied but was not selected for the final 100			1
" my brother is pretty jealous , but the rest of my friends and family are proud and excited			0
" the only exception is @entity108 's boyfriend , who does n't want her to go			0
@entity108 thinks it was her teamworking skills which saw her through this far -- in her current job she works as part of a group of four , the same size as the planned @entity0 crew			1
but she 's not pretending a trip to @entity4 is going to be a walk in the park			1
" when i think about it seriously i am petrified , " she says , " but that does n't put me off , it drives me forward			0
" though she admits she does n't know if she is the right person for the job : " nobody can say 100 % how they will react until training			2
" like many who applied , the chance to join the small group of people who have left our planet is the biggest draw for @entity108			0
but there are still questions over whether the mission will even happen			0
as well as the @entity28 study raising doubts over the technology , @entity0 must raise an estimated $ 6 billion , which it hopes to achieve through various methods , including crowdfunding , sponsorship and sales			1
" i definitely think it will happen , but in terms of the current roadmap , i just do n't know whether it will happen on time , " she says			0
" a lot will depend on the unmanned missions planned for 2018			2
" not daunted by the prospect of leaving behind friends and family , @entity108 believes that the one - way trip is what needs to be done if we are ever to colonize @entity4			1
" @entity178 will be a test of character , but we will still have contact through emails -- it 's not game over			0
" astronaut set to spend one year in space			0

@entity0 announces 100 candidates for @entity4 colony
first launch is planned for 2024 , to land in 2025
there are doubts over the *feasibility* of the project , but " *pioneers* are always ridiculed , " says @entity4 hopeful @entity45
