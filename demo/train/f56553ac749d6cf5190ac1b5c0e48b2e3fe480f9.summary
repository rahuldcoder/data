-- @entity1 documented some of the biggest global weather stories of the year , and captured some amazing photos in the process			1
click through the gallery above to see some of their most compelling photographs of 2012			1
and if you 're wondering how you might be able to capture images like this , it just so happens that @entity0 meteorologists @entity13 and @entity15 recently joined the @entity17 community on @entity18 for a discussion on that very topic			1
read their top 13 weather photography tips : 1			1
when it comes to weather photography on @entity17 , timing is everything , according to @entity13			1
oftentimes people will submit great weather images , " but it 's a day or two after the event			1
by then we have moved on to new stories , " he said			1
give lightning photos visual context			2
lightning photos tend to be a common subject in weather photographs , and @entity13 says at times they start to look similar			1
" what makes a lightning photo unique is what else is in the picture			2
[ like ] an iconic building for instance , or a harbor in @entity48 , " he said			0
but why does a building matter in a weather photo anyway ? @entity13 says things like a building or a harbor add to the overall context of the photograph			2
" it makes it easier to tell the story on tv , and relates it to the viewer			0
the @entity64 suffered a prolonged drought that not only stunted the growth of crops like corn and wheat , but dried out essential bodies of water , bringing parts of the @entity73 to extremely low levels			0
despite the visible signs of drought , it can be one of the hardest things to capture through photography , @entity15 said			0
the best way to convey drought is by capturing the texture , like photographing a dried up lakebed			2
" most people never see the bottom of a lake , " he said			0
" [ it ] puts the whole drought into perspective			0
when it comes to capturing weather , it is important to see the whole picture			1
@entity13 suggests using wide angle shots to help put the photograph in context			1
" show more of the sky and not necessarily focus on what you think is important , like zooming in on a funnel cloud and ignoring the rest of the storm , " he said			0
that epic weather moment can happen literally in a flash			2
if you want to increase your likelihood of capturing a great weather shot , you have to shoot multiple photographs , according to @entity15			1
" you never want to shoot only one photo , " he said			0
as quickly as weather changes , it also moves			2
standing in one location may not be the best method when it comes to capturing a weather photograph			1
" move around and get a little bit of a different perspective , " @entity15 said			0
adding more perspective gives your photographs more depth and context , he explains			2
a slight change in saturation , a little color boost or @entity130 - type filter on a weather photograph can totally change its meaning			1
@entity13 says to avoid adding filters when capturing weather photographs			1
edit with darkroom tricks only			0
here is @entity15 ' rule of thumb for editing weather photographs : " only do in post-production what you could have done in a darkroom , " he said			1
" simple contrast , exposure , cropping and white balance are all you really should ever do , unless you are working on something for an art exhibit			0
weather is dynamic , but sometimes the shot you are looking for might not happen right away			2
patience is fundamental , according to @entity15 , who also suggests using a remote camera set - up prior to a weather event			1
after setting up your camera , @entity15 says it 's all about waiting			0
it may take awhile , but eventually you will get the strike you are looking for			0
if you want to capture weather photographs , @entity13 suggests monitoring the @entity166 and @entity167			1
" they will provide accurate forecasts one to three days out for tornadoes , wind , hail , etc. , " he said			0
do n't just hold hail			0
@entity174 is a big weather event , and happens in many parts of the world			2
it 's common for people to photograph images of themselves holding up pieces of hail , but those images do n't place the storm in context			2
@entity15 says hail is great to photograph when it is in perspective of the people it is affecting			0
he suggests photographing hail if it damages crops or breaks windshields , for example			0
time - lapses are a bit trickier to create , but they are a great way of capturing the whole storm , according to @entity13			1
" we love time - lapses , " he said			1
" it allows us to show an entire storm unfold in a few seconds			0
" he says the best events in which to use time - lapse photography are snowstorms or a hurricane 's passage			1
weather is dangerous , and when it comes to photographing it , @entity15 says it 's important to be cognizant of general weather safety			2
" know your surroundings and the safest place to be , " he said			0
sometimes you do n't even need to be out in the storm to capture that perfect shot			0
@entity15 suggests using a camera with a remote timer			0
" i put my camera -- with a manual setting -- on a tripod ... set the aperture ... and focus on infinity or an object i want to be the center of [ my ] story , " he said			0
now get out there and put those tips to work ! you can share your images in our severe weather or winter weather assignment .			1
