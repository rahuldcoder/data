the @entity16 story endures because deep down , people want to believe in improbable beauty and equal access to happily ever after			2
you know how it goes : a kind young girl alone and far from home is placed in a hostile environment , ignored and abused			2
against all odds , she finds the power of her imagination , transforms into a graceful beauty and becomes the belle of the ball			2
@entity6 's ascent into media stardom mirrors this legendary narrative			1
this is from @entity35 : " i admit it			0
i ca n't go more than three days without looking at a picture of her			0
" that 's one of the scores of daily posts on every social media platform about the breakout actress , mostly from women and girls of color			1
the image of @entity51 is feeding an old hunger familiar to the hearts of women of @entity56 decent and quenching a newfound thirst for everyone else			0
she added , as they say in the fashion world , a " pop of color " to the neutral landscape of types in the 2014 awards season			1
the beginning of @entity6 's fairy - tale rise to @entity5 's new it girl began with her brilliant portrayal of @entity70 , a filthy , psychologically abused and violently beaten slave in the best picture winner , " 12 years a slave			1
" and yet in a matter of months , the prevailing image of her is an exquisite beauty queen conquering every red carpet and glossy fashion page she 's graced			2
and there have been many			0
the @entity80 were @entity6 's first major glamorous arrival			1
she did n't take home the best supporting actress award for which she was nominated , but from @entity84 to tumblr , she reigned on all the best - dressed lists			1

and she has been slaying every other appearance ever since			0
@entity5 can be a hostile and stubborn place for diversity : only 31 black people have won an @entity7 in the 85 - year history of the @entity7			1
it can be especially treacherous and narrow when it comes to images of women			0
and the women on the silver screen set the gold bar for the standard of beauty for much of the world 's media			1
analyze any parade of actresses on any major awards show red carpet , and the message is clear : the criteria for a position in the elite clique of beauties are to be white and thin , with hair that blows in the wind			0
though @entity6 certainly has a near - fatless body , her deep , rich skin tone and the length and texture of her hair are a sharp detour away from the standard			1
unfortunately , it 's not rare that just one woman of color was nominated for major acting awards this year			1
out of her many nominations , in addition to her @entity7 win , she 's also won the @entity139 for best supporting actress , the @entity141 for outstanding supporting actress and the @entity143 for best supporting actress			1
other black women who have won the @entity7 in the best supporting actress category are @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			1
what stands out about @entity6 is that she is top - model gorgeous , classically trained and impossibly elegant and has an indisputable @entity56 name			2
she 's the first black @entity56 to ever win			0
nyong'o can wear practically any gown that has ever been on a couture runway			0
she fits the high - fashion role while simultaneously expanding it			0
she is old - @entity5 elegant and new - school @entity56			2
at the @entity7 , it was her dark , luminous skin and short , tightly coiled hair that made the billowy cornflower princess gown by @entity163 look so dreamy			2
like art and life , beauty without contrasts is n't interesting			0
@entity168 is a ravishing contrast against the pale landscape of beauty possibilities most women and girls are given from @entity5 and high - fashion media			1
she represents a possibility of another kind of dream girl			0
