@entity0 , @entity1 -- a prominent @entity1 political activist was shot and wounded wednesday , the day after the national government declared a state of emergency amid violence - plagued protests in @entity0 , a police official said			1
unidentified people in a pickup truck opened fire on @entity12 , a local leader of the pro-government " red shirt " movement , outside his home in @entity17 in northeastern @entity1 , said police official col. @entity18			1
his wounds are n't life - threatening , @entity18 said			1
police suspect the shooting may be politically motivated , he said , but they have n't ruled out a connection to @entity12 's " personal conflicts			1
" the attack is likely to fan tensions in @entity1 's political crisis			2
in @entity0 , demonstrations against prime minister @entity29 have been hit by attacks with explosives in the past week that have killed one person and wounded dozens			1
the violence , whose perpetrators have n't been identified , prompted authorities to impose the state of emergency , which went into effect wednesday and lasts 60 days			1
the emergency decree gives authorities the power to impose curfews , detain suspects without court permission , censor media and declare parts of the capital off - limits			0
political divide the red shirts -- who draw their support from the populous , less affluent northeast of @entity1 -- support @entity29 's government			1
on the other side of the country 's political divide are the anti-government protesters , who are loosely allied with the opposition @entity60			0
since the protesters began their campaign against @entity29 's government in november , at least nine people have died and hundreds have been wounded , according to authorities			2
in a bid to resolve the crisis , @entity29 dissolved parliament last month and called for new elections to be held february 2			1
but the move has done little to appease protesters			0
they have called on @entity29 to step down from her caretaker position and be replaced by an unelected " people 's council , " which would see through electoral and political changes			0
they want the elections postponed , and the @entity60 has said it will boycott the vote			0
protesters remain on streets @entity1 's national security chief , lt. gen. @entity82 said the emergency decree had been considered because " we are predicting that ( the ) situation might get more violent " as the vote nears			1
" we are witnessing more gun shootings and bomb incidents on the streets of @entity0 , " he said			2
thousands of protesters have remained on the streets ahead of the elections			1
the latest round of demonstrations , which began last week , was aimed at shutting down @entity0			2
they have succeeded in disrupting traffic at major intersections in the city , but their numbers have fallen significantly since the initial rallies			0
protest leaders have said they want to rid @entity1 of the influence of former prime minister @entity103 , the older brother of @entity29			2
@entity103 was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas			0
if he returns , he risks a two - year prison sentence on a corruption conviction , which he says was politically motivated			0
they say @entity29 is merely a puppet of @entity103 , a divisive figure who built his support on populist policies that pleased residents of the north and northeast			0
@entity29 has repeatedly denied her brother calls the shots in the government			0
the protest movement in @entity0 began as an angry response to a botched attempt by @entity29 's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for @entity103 's return			2
@entity1 's worst bout of civil unrest took place in 2010 , when the government -- run at the time by the @entity60 -- ordered a crackdown on red shirt protesters , leaving about 90 people dead			1
@entity2 's @entity136 reported from @entity0 , and @entity137 reported and wrote from @entity138			0
@entity2 's @entity139 contributed to this report .			0
