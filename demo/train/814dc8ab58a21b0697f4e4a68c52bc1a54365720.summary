" on @entity45 , @entity1 said he was " @entity46 better listening to @entity47 " in a picture that showed the shirtless singer apparently lounging in a hospital room with a pair of headphones on			1

" not even @entity1 's 19th birthday on march 1 would be a high point of the " boyfriend " singer 's less than stellar week			2
