if you vote for the @entity6 in 2013 , who knows who you will end up with ?

in a jab at her rival , @entity4 complained in an interview with @entity0 affiliate @entity131 this week that no one had approached her to mount a leadership ballot in a traditional manner			0
" call me old - fashioned , but the way in which these things are normally done is a challenger approaches the leader of the @entity6 and asks them to call a ballot for the leadership , you shake hands and then a ballot is held , " she said			2
@entity4 called for any challengers to put their names on the ballot , which would be the last one she would call to challenge her position			0
