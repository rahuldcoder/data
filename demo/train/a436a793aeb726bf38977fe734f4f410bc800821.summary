can someone please explain to me the details of @entity3 ? and when i say " someone , " i 'm looking at you , president @entity5 -- or at least members of your administration			1
i ca n't fathom how @entity5 , one of the best orators of modern - day politics , could be such a poor advocate for what 's arguably the crowning legislative achievement of his administration			1
i can assure you that if there were a law named after me -- such as " @entity16 " or " @entity17 " -- i would be crisscrossing the country explaining it so people would understand and support it			1
sure , most of us get the broad strokes of the @entity3 commonly known as @entity3 : the individual mandate , coverage for the uninsured , children on parents ' policy until 26 , carriers can not deny you coverage or charge you more due to a pre-existing condition			1
but the law is close to 1,000 pages and will spur hundreds , if not thousands , of regulations			0
what else does the law offer , and how will @entity38 be able to gain access to its benefits ? will @entity3 help primary care ? we hear about state health insurance exchanges going into effect in october , but in the same breath we hear that many governors wo n't implement them			1
we hear about the individual mandate obligating everyone to buy health insurance by 2014 or face a penalty , but then we hear the @entity5 administration has delayed the requirement that employers with more than 50 employees be required to provide health coverage until 2015			0
it 's remarkable that there 's such confusion surrounding a piece of legislation signed into law more than three years ago -- in march 2010			0
and i 'm far from alone on this			0
a poll in april found that 40 % of @entity38 did n't even know if @entity3 is still in effect , which translates into roughly 130 million @entity38 not even knowing if the law still exists , let alone understanding the details of it			1
even more concerning is that a recent poll of doctors found by a wide margin that they are " not at all familiar " with how certain key provisions of the law will be implemented			0
and astoundingly , it appears that @entity77 members of @entity78 do n't even fully grasp how @entity3 will be put into effect			1
that point was made crystal clear when @entity77 sen. @entity82 , one of the early champions of the law , recently labeled the rollout of @entity3 " a huge train wreck coming down			2
" in response , @entity5 's chief of staff has been spending time over the past three months giving presentations to @entity77 in @entity78 so they can better understand the law			0
who loses out under @entity3 ? what 's even more surprising is that @entity5 has allowed the void of information from his end to be filled almost unchallenged by @entity97 , who have been actively working to define the law in the worst possible terms			1
unless @entity5 is mimicking the rope - a - dope fighting strategy made famous by @entity101 , his administration 's outreach to the public on @entity3 has been an abysmal failure			1
the consequence of @entity5 ceding the battlefield can be seen in a new poll that found 54 % of @entity38 disapprove of the law and a record - high 39 % want @entity78 to repeal it			0
the poll also found just 13 % of @entity38 say the health care law will personally " help me , " but 38 % believe the law will personally " hurt me			0
" maybe it was these poll numbers or perhaps being pushed by members of his own party , but it seems that @entity5 is finally aware of the public relations nightmare and possible policy failure staring him in the face			2
the administration has recently started organizing faith - based and community groups to help get out the word			0
the federal government just launched a multimillion - dollar campaign to educate people about coverage options under @entity3			2
it has even secured the support of the people at the @entity135 comedy website to produce videos with well - known comedic actors explaining @entity3 -- because nothing says " comedy gold " like a law about health insurance			1
@entity5 meets with celebs who want to promote @entity3 but why did n't @entity5 utilize his great communication skills to explain this law to us sooner ? why has n't he traveled across the country waging something akin to his election campaign to sell his program ? and it 's not like @entity5 does n't see the value in taking his ideas directly to the @entity38 public to build support			1
indeed , we saw @entity5 use this very tactic last week as he kicked off the first of a series of speeches regarding his proposals to strengthen and grow the economy			0
the president did mention @entity3 in that speech , pointing out that " the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down			2
just last week , @entity168 announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50 % less than what they pay today			0
" and what 's even more bizarre is that polls show strong support for many key provisions of @entity3			2
the president could have ( and should have ) been touting these popular parts of the law for years , given that 61 % of @entity38 favor allowing children to stay on the policy until they are 26 and 82 % like the ban on insurance carriers from denying coverage for those with pre-existing conditions			0
could it be that @entity5 is n't waging such a campaign because even he ca n't explain this mammoth program in a way that will attract support ? is it possible that the president 's idealistic dream of what @entity3 was intended to be has been replaced three years later by an administrative nightmare ? the real reason why the @entity5 administration has remained largely invisible as @entity97 have pummeled @entity3 may never truly be known			1
but it 's clear that @entity3 needs a massive infusion of pr care if it is going to succeed			2
watch : two sides of @entity3			0

@entity205 says the administration has done a poor job of explaining @entity3
he says the plan has many popular features , but the public does n't fully understand it
a failure to explain has left room for @entity97 to *distort* it , he says
@entity205 : administration has belatedly moved to tout the benefits of @entity3
