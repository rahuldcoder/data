-- if you gave most folks the choice between their smartphone and their nondominant hand , many of us would wave a one - palmed goodbye to mr. @entity9 / @entity8 , weld our iphones to our wrists and grimly welcome an existence of terminator - like efficiency			2
yup , we 're addicted to those little bleating beasts , so much so that we fold them wholly into our workaday lives , blindly committing a cornucopia of social indignities with zero cognizance			1
conversely , we look down our noses at those who commit the very same phone faux pas , hypocritically musing over their every social slight			1
well , my friends , it 's time to stand up and take notice			2
we 're not asking you to wholly throw out the litany of bad habits below ( that is entirely impossible , and we will have executed at least four of 10 before the week is out )			2
we merely ask you to be more aware of when you 're about to do something that , if done to you , would send you into a frothy fit of rage			2
the @entity36 may be sailing toward us on the wings of fall , but the aforementioned bionic scenario is still a ways off ( we hope )			2
let 's all try not to do these : 1 )			2
walking while texting we know that @entity43 totally needs to know that you 'll be 15 minutes late to his ' 70s - themed fondue party ( because you had a polyester - induced wardrobe crisis ) , but we 're pretty sure that the owner of that baby carriage that you upended in your fervor to alert @entity51 does n't give a fig about your sartorial issues			1
and that kid 's later - life bed - wetting will be completely your fault			2
pulling out the phone at the dinner table or pulling out the phone ( for any extended period of time ) during any social situation , really			1
yeah , we know that the notion of beating your brother - in - law at @entity66 has been haunting your very dreams , but your friend / family member / other of varying degrees of significance is probably much more interesting			1
if that is not , in fact , the case , consider hanging with your brother - in - law instead			0
returning a call with a text unless you 're in a movie theater , at work or in the middle of an important life moment , said action makes you appear socially awkward			1
crop - dusting it 's friday night and you want to rage ! systematically , you scroll through all of your contacts , shooting them nearly identical messages : " what @entity87 up 2 2nite ? ? ? " whoever answers first -- or whoever answers with the best , most exciting plans ( jello shots and football and girls ! ! ! ) -- is the winner			1
and you have won , too ! you won the role of " @entity97 " among your disgruntled friend group			0
messenger - pigeoning you 're watching that brand new show starring the unmatchably quirky @entity100 on @entity101 when a pal texts you , asking what time you want to have dinner later			0
you think to yourself , " 7:30 ... " you commence watching @entity100 dance and twirl			0
three hours later , you text back , " 7:30			0
" and thusly , you have transported humankind from a time of instantaneous communication to an era when we had to wait for rats with wings to deliver fecal - stained parchments across the sea			0
drunk dialing / texting you already lost most of your dignity when you entered that dance contest after slamming five tequila shots			0
retain the remainder and give your phone to a friend			1
lifecasting in lieu of living you may have a problem if : your first thought when gazing up at a sun - splashed sky , rippling and luminescent like a melting watercolor , is " i have to @entity132 that " instead of , " oh , pretty sunset			0
" similarly : when any semi-intelligent musing becomes worthy of a tweet			0
digital dallying you stopped physically seeing this dude / chick about three weeks ago , but you still text him / her every once in a while ( " @entity145 , it 's like unseasonably warm today ! " ) , you still comment on all of his / her stuff on @entity143 and you 're currently engaged in a vigorous game of @entity147			1
you have , in essence , become a @entity150 -- a presence on his / her phone that s / he keeps just barely alive by typing and texting			1
very soon , however , your keeper will likely let you die , because you , like a @entity150 , are annoying and useless			1
conversations in public " yeah , i do think you should dump him			0
cheating is just really , really unforgivable			0
also , i mean , you do n't want to get crabs , right ? oh ... i 'm sorry , i thought you were looking for my input , seeing as how you 've been sitting next to me at this coffee shop for the last 30 minutes , babbling into your earpiece about @entity164			0
on that note , yeah , i think there 's a cream for that			0
taking your phone into the bathroom we 're sad that we even need to include this one .			1

there are lots of ways to commit social faux pas with you 're phone
unless you 're at work , do n't reply to a phone call with a text
do n't be a @entity150 -- a presence on his / her phone that 's just barely alive
your friend / family member is probably much more interesting than that text
