@entity0 , @entity1 -- of all the amazing @entity0 , @entity1 , musicians , my favorite could be @entity6			1
@entity6 performs on the @entity8 stage at the @entity9			1
he cut his teeth at age 4 playing with legends like @entity13			2
at 19 , he toured with @entity14			2
and now , at age 23 , @entity6 is getting ready to play with @entity16 and release his latest cd			1
he 's played every venue in @entity0 you can think of			1
i had the chance to catch up with him at the 40th annual @entity9 this week			1
the following is an edited version of that interview			2
@entity2 : you ca n't ask for better weather , better crowd , and to be the face of @entity30			1
how does it feel ? trombone shorty : well , it feels great			1
i 'm happy to be in my city and get a warm reception like that from the audience			0
and i 'm honored to be on the poster this year , because when they first called me , i thought it was a joke			2
i thought i had to put in at least 20 more years of work			0
so for me to be one of the youngest on there ever , i 'm happy			0
i 'm like a kid in a candy store			0
i just want to find ways to help the city , and one of the ways to do it is right here at the @entity9			1
@entity2 : what does it mean to be here , especially this kind of crowd , on the 40th anniversary [ of the festival ] ? the economy has been bad , but can you put a price tag on what it does to the spirit ? ts : everywhere i go around the world , we have fans of @entity0			1
sometimes we go places , and people do n't really know who we are , but they know @entity0 , and once we say we are from @entity0 , we have a lot of supporters			1
to be here on a wonderful day and to have a big crowd of people coming out to help @entity0 is a wonderful thing			1
@entity2 : tell me about your band , the education you got and these young guys playing with you			2
what you are going to mean to the city as you age and get the recognition that you deserve ? ts : i just want to spearhead and lead a new style of @entity0 music			1
a lot of people have been doing the same thing for years , and i just want to be one of the people who create the next 50 years of @entity0			1
and my band , most of them i got from @entity0 ( @entity0 creative arts ) , where @entity91 , @entity92 and most of those guys graduated			1
some of them i met from @entity95 , and we all got together			0
i was a natural musician first , then i went to school , and i got the best young musicians i saw around town , and we have been playing in this band for nine or 10 years now			2
@entity2 : i 've seen you the last several years , and you seem much more comfortable as a front man			0
not just playing the horn great but leading the crowd , singing			0
am i right reading into that ? ts : i wanted to become a better entertainer , and i learned from my brother @entity107			0
and i 've been studying some tape of @entity109 and different people			0
i 've just wanted to see what i could do			0
i just wanted to make people comfortable with seeing a horn			0
because if you see a horn on a poster with some guy , you automatically think it 's a sit - down jazz thing			2
and coming from @entity119 [ @entity0 ] , everything has been about dancing and second - lining and partying and everything			1
that 's where i am from , so i just wanted to take that and put it with this style of playing			0
@entity2 : tell me what your favorite food is			0
do you get to sample a lot of it ? ts : i got ta say the crawfish monica and the crawfish bread			0
i eat it every day			0
last year i got sick from eating like 10 of them !			0
