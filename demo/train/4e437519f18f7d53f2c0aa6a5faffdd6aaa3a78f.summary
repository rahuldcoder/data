-- nearly two years ago in june 2010 , the war in @entity2 surpassed the @entity3 to become the longest war in @entity6 history			1
although the @entity6 ousted the @entity8 from power and killed @entity10 last year in @entity11 , it is clear that recent incidents , including the tragic killing of civilians by a @entity6 soldier , are costing @entity6 the hearts and minds of the people of @entity2			1
as a result , there should be real concern that the lives of nearly 2,000 @entity6 troops and more than 14,000 @entity2 civilians who have been killed during this decade - long war could have been lost in vain			2
the most recent blow to the @entity29 mission in @entity2 is the dreadful story of an @entity6 soldier who apparently " went rogue " in a night - time shooting massacre and allegedly murdered at least 16 innocent civilians , including nine children and three women , sunday morning near a @entity6 base in southern @entity2			1
" i am deeply saddened by the reported killing and wounding of @entity2 civilians , " president @entity37 immediately said in a statement			2
" i offer my condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives , and to the people of @entity2 , who have endured too much violence and suffering			0
this incident is tragic and shocking , and does not represent the exceptional character of our military and the respect that the @entity6 has for the people of @entity2			2
" the killings come after several copies of the @entity55 were accidentally burned last month along with garbage and other materials seized from a detainee facility at @entity59			0
president @entity37 apologized to @entity2 president @entity60 , calling the burning " an inadvertent error , " but the subsequent furor led to violent protests and physical attacks in which 39 people died , including several @entity6 soldiers , and hundreds were wounded			2
in january , four @entity6 soldiers were caught on videotape standing over some @entity2 corpses and urinating on the bodies while laughingly saying things like " have a great day , buddy			1
" @entity6 officials denounced the actions and made clear it was unacceptable conduct , amounting to a violation of both the @entity80 and @entity6 military law			0
in light of these three high - profile and polarizing incidents in @entity2 within the last three months , prominent journalist @entity82 wrote that " after the @entity55 burnings , i can not see a future for @entity6 forces in ( @entity2 )			1
the pressure to quit before 2014 will grow			0
" he also said " our cultures are far too far apart to mesh ; and the more we insist on succeeding with an unwinnable transition , the deeper into the mire we go			0
" @entity2 is well - known as the " graveyard of empires			2
" it cast off the imperialist likes of @entity97 , @entity98 and the @entity99 , the @entity102 @entity101 colonial empire and most recently , the @entity104 communist empire			0
" no outside force has , since the @entity106 invasion , ever pacified the entire country ( of @entity2 )			0
... even @entity97 only passed through , " former @entity6 secretary of state @entity109 wrote in october , 2009			0
we have spent more than an entire decade trying to win the hearts and minds of the people of @entity2 , we should remember the words of a 2009 @entity116 policy paper which reminded us there is " a reason why ( @entity2 ) has been described as the ' graveyard of empires , ' and unless @entity6 scales down its objectives , it risks meeting a similar fate			1
" as we look back over our 10 - year mission in @entity2 , we should remember that we have successfully struck back at @entity10 and @entity124 , helped transition a more - than - slightly corrupt civilian government into power and somewhat improved the plight of women within the borders of @entity2			1
but we should also concede that the stories of a rogue soldier 's killing spree and @entity55 burnings could be the lasting legacies of the longest war in @entity6 history -- and should be overwhelming reasons that we need to leave @entity2 right now by beginning our troop withdrawal			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			0

@entity142 : @entity144 has lasted longer than @entity3 , anger growing
@entity142 : @entity2 abhor soldier 's massacre , @entity55 burnings , soldiers urinating on bodies
@entity2 has been called the " graveyard of empires , " he says , and for good reason
@entity142 : @entity6 killed @entity10 , routed @entity124 ; time to count successes and leave
