-- they will say this is about one person			0
they will attempt to distance themselves from the controversy			0
they will even try to claim the whole conversation is a distraction from the " real issues			0
" and yet they never shy away from using this same conversation to fire up their base , or hurl attack ads or raise funds			0
the truth is the " legitimate rape " comment made by @entity21 rep. @entity20 -- as in pregnancy from " legitimate rape " is rare -- is not a @entity26 anomaly but rather another disturbing glimpse into the viewpoint too many social conservatives have about women 's health and reproductive rights			1
and if abortion is not among the " real issues , " why is the @entity26 platform committee considering adding a ban , with no mention of exceptions , to this year 's to - do list ? @entity20 defies calls to withdraw from @entity40 race last march , in a discussion in the @entity43 about whether women purchase separate abortion - only policies , @entity26 state rep. @entity41 suggested women should plan ahead for rape the way he keeps a spare tire			1
a few weeks later , @entity52 state rep. @entity51 , a @entity26 , said some women might fake being raped in order to get free abortions			1
former presidential hopeful @entity56 suggested doctors who perform an abortion on a woman who becomes pregnant from an attack should be thrown in jail and this year suggested rape victims who become pregnant from an attack should be forced to keep the baby and " make the best out of a bad situation			0
" and we 're to believe @entity20 is just a one - off			2
more than 200 @entity26 members of @entity70 joined him in co-sponsoring @entity72 , the @entity72 , when it contained language restricting the exception for federally funded abortions to " an act of forcible rape or , if a minor , an act of incest			1
that 's not too far from " legitimate rape " so vice presidential hopeful @entity83 can try to backpedal away from @entity20 as fast as he can , but his name is still on the record in support of that bill , with that language			1
he can say he 's in line with @entity90 and would not ban abortions in the case of rape , but it 's his name attached to @entity94 : @entity95 , which would have done just that			1
@entity26 platform committee approves tough anti-abortion stance no wonder @entity90 chose @entity83 as his running mate ; he admires the speed with which the congressman from @entity104 flip - flops			1
so yes , the current general election conversation may be largely about @entity106			0
the dialogue may eventually work its way back to the economy and jobs			0
but do n't think for a second that social issues -- particularly abortion -- are not in the @entity26 's sights			2
since the tea party helped pull the @entity26 back into power in 2010 -- under the guise of controlling government spending -- close to 1,000 anti-abortion bills have been introduced across the country			2
i ca n't think of anything approaching that number of bills with the goal of creating jobs in that same time span , can you ? at a @entity130 " tele - town hall meeting " in december , @entity56 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 all said they would work to outlaw all abortions , regardless of the circumstances			0
you can fully expect a @entity70 to move quickly to ban all abortions , regardless of circumstances			1
and given that a would - be president @entity90 said , " i will protect a woman 's right to choose , " when he was running for @entity141 governor in 2002 , only to become an anti-abortion advocate while running for president , there 's no telling which side of the issue he will fall on , on any given day			2
opinion : @entity26 policy is the scandal , not just @entity20 some social conservatives talk of protecting religious freedom , but what they are really seeking is a theocracy that places limits on freedom based on a version of @entity160 that fits their liking			1
that language is also being considered for the @entity26 's national platform			2
some speak of fighting abortion because of their religious convictions and then belittle the trauma caused by rape			0
they think they can make this controversy all about @entity20 , as if @entity83 's legislative history is just going to disappear			1
as if @entity41 never suggested women should plan ahead for rape the way he keeps a spare tire			0
as if none of us are paying attention			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2

@entity179 : @entity20 's " rape " comment offers glimpse into some conservatives ' views
he says @entity20 's views *politically* *embarrassing* , but such views *voiced* by others in @entity26
he says @entity83 's name on anti-abortion bill making odd *distinction* about " forcible rape "
@entity179 : you can expect a @entity26 @entity70 to move quickly to ban all abortions
