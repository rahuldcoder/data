-- tens of millions of online note - takers found themselves worrying about their security monday , as questions remained about a weekend hack of @entity6			1
the online note - taking and archiving service began requiring its 50 million users to reset their passwords saturday after announcing it was the victim of a security breach , making it the latest tech company in recent weeks to fall victim to hackers			1
in a blog post , the @entity18 - based company said its security team " has discovered and blocked suspicious activity on the @entity6 network that appears to have been a coordinated attempt to access secure areas of the @entity24			1
" the company said no user content or financial information was accessed			1
but the hackers were able to access user information , including user names , e-mail addresses and encrypted passwords			1
@entity6 said the encryption coding they use to protect passwords is " robust , " but still sent the password warning to users of the service , which is popular among college students and others who rely on taking notes for later use			1
@entity44 analyst @entity43 said in a blog post that it remains unclear how long the hackers had access to @entity6 and how they managed to get in			1
" what 's not good news , " he wrote , " is that the hackers now have access to the usernames and email addresses of @entity6 customers			1
it is easy to imagine how this information could be abused -- for instance , the hackers could send out spam emails to those users claiming to come from @entity6 , and trick them into visiting a malicious website			2
" and , of course , it 's another cautionary tale about the risks which can exist with trusting the cloud to look after your personal information			0
" like many services , @entity6 stores data on remote servers instead of the user 's computer			2
this allows them to be accessed from multiple computers and other devices			0
@entity6 warned users of the possibilities @entity43 noted			0
he argued that their message -- warning users not to click phony security e-mails while sending out a security e-mail of their own -- could confuse users			0
complicating matters is that the legitimate @entity6 e-mail pushes users first to a website with the domain name " mkt5371 " before taking them to evernote itself			2
@entity43 wrote that this is a service @entity6 is likely using to track how many of its users changed their passwords and says not to worry			0
" that 's a technique commonly used in a normal marketing email communications , but looks very out of place in an email about a security breach which tries to hammer home the point to ' never click on reset - password requests in emails , " he said			0
last week , customer support tool @entity104 announced it was hacked , with the breach exposing the e-mail addresses of users of three other websites -- @entity112 , @entity113 , and @entity114 , all of which use @entity104			2
@entity115 , @entity116 , and @entity117 last month said they were the victim of hackers , and @entity114 said in january that it , too , was hacked			1
reports that surfaced last week suggested that a gang of hackers based in @entity122 was behind at least some of the attacks , using a website frequented by developers who use @entity116 's mobile operating system to worm their way into companies where they hoped to steal valuable information			0
@entity6 launched in 2008 as a way to archive images , documents , notes and other data online			0
a version for businesses is available in more than 30 countries			0
@entity0 's @entity139 contributed to this report .			0
