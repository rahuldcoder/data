-- " @entity1 " director @entity0 is n't the type to be cowed by literary pedigree , not even that of @entity5			1
his movies , including " @entity7 , " are like watching a three - ring circus			2
they revel in surface , spectacle and sensory overload			1
they 're audaciously , passionately artificial and at the same time unabashedly romantic -- post-modern pop medleys aimed at the heart , not the brain			2
perhaps @entity0 even identifies with @entity5 's @entity17 ; after all , they 're both decadents			1
but @entity5 was n't @entity17 , and @entity17 could never have written such a novel			2
it takes an observer like @entity1 ( @entity22 ) to distill the finer sentiments from this sorry tale of the super-rich , and @entity0 is n't that			1
he 's an extrovert who wants to thrill us and immerse us in his giddy daring			0
the last thing he wants to do is sit back and watch			0
there are no two ways about it : " @entity1 " is misconceived and misjudged , a crude burlesque on what 's probably @entity39 literature 's most precious jewel			1
shopping gatsby : 15 items you 'll love warning bells go off right from the first shots of a cgi version of @entity47 's @entity46			2
the camera is in a state of constant agitation , while the actors -- and they 're good actors -- seem to have been instructed to vamp			0
either that , or they decided it was the only way to compete with the film 's garish hot deco			0
but let 's give @entity0 his due : the man does cut a good teaser			1
the idea to swap @entity62 for @entity63 and ragtime for rap was a bold and brilliant choice			0
casting @entity67 as the glamorous , elusive billionaire @entity17 and @entity22 as his modest , admiring neighbor was right on			0
@entity70 as @entity71 was n't as inspired			2
she gets the sadness of the character but not the flip side of her personality , and she 's just not a bright enough spark to keep @entity17 's torch burning for so long			0
and shooting in @entity78 ? look at " @entity79 " and " @entity80 " : it could have worked			0
yet @entity0 seems utterly bamboozled by the technique , as if it 's thrown off his rhythm			1
the early scenes especially are likely to induce motion sickness , and not just because @entity87 is getting drunk on @entity47 's high society			0
we know @entity0 can throw a wild party , but the movie does n't build or grow ; it just keeps hitting the same high notes until we go numb to the din			1
and if he 's lost in the loud revelry , @entity0 is completely out of his element in the more intimate scenes			1
the reunion between @entity17 and @entity71 is played for laughs ( and it gets a couple , too ) , but @entity0 shortchanges whatever it is that pulls these lovers together			1
for such an elaborate display of courtship , it 's a remarkably unsensual affair			0
@entity5 's " @entity1 " will endure this indignity as surely as it outlasted previous versions with @entity110 and @entity111			1
it 's a shame , though , since the novel 's depiction of a society dancing on the edge of a precipice is so timely			0
it 's hard not to feel angry at the waste .			0

@entity0 is known for sensory overload with his movies
" gatsby " needs an observant *storyteller* , which @entity0 is n't
the adaptation is misconceived and misjudged
nevertheless , the novel will endure this indignity
