@entity0 , @entity1 -- as @entity4 women artists , @entity5 and @entity6 , feel they are fighting against multiple stereotypes			1
they are caught between conservative attitudes at home and western critics who expect them to address women 's rights in their work			1
" they want you to talk about very limited things like sexual oppression , search for identity and if you do n't fit these criteria you 're excluded and you are not considered a good artist , " said @entity13			2
@entity13 , a photographer , has another reason for being wary of people 's expectations : she is a princess , a granddaughter of the first king of @entity4			1
she avoids being photographed or showing her face in interviews to allow her to travel the world anonymously without bodyguards			0
her work has taken her to @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and all around the @entity37 , capturing striking black - and - white photographs of people and landscapes			1
@entity6 , a single mother who brought up her two sons in @entity43 , creates abstract art , often geometric black - and - white drawings			1
she said : " people kind of concentrate on you and give you more attention because you have female @entity4 artists , but it 's kind of upsetting because it 's related to stereotype , and i think what we are doing is changing this stereotype			1
" her work includes " infinite square , " in which she uses the word @entity56 -- the @entity58 word for @entity59 -- to create geometric shapes and lines connecting the artist to a timeless world unlimited by borders			1
@entity6 said : " i am trying to say that i am not a prisoner of a moment or a place			2
my work is -- i would say -- eternal			0
it 's not restricted to an event or an experience or anything			0
it 's spiritual , it 's higher than senses			0
" @entity13 and @entity6 , along with other @entity4 artists , displayed their work at the @entity79 exhibition of modern @entity4 artists in @entity81 last year and more recently in @entity0			1
the position of @entity4 women has gained attention worldwide after @entity85 announced in september that women will in future be allowed to serve as members of the @entity89 , the appointed consultative council that advises the king			1
he also said women will be allowed to run as candidates and nominate candidates in the next set of municipal elections			0
they could not participate in municipal elections that were held last month for only the second time in the kingdom 's history			0
women are also subject to male guardianship laws , in which they have to seek permission from their husband , father or even son to work , travel , study and many other activities			2
@entity4 women have been campaigning for the right to drive			1
last month @entity85 revoked a flogging sentence of 10 lashes for a woman allegedly arrested for driving a car			0
@entity113 , who founded the @entity114 earlier this year to campaign for greater rights , welcomed @entity85 's announcements but said they did not go far enough			2
" we are afraid that it 's not going to happen the way we want it to , " she said			0
" also we think that this decision is good but it 's not enough			0
" @entity123 said she still wanted to see the end of male guardianship , the introduction of laws to protect women from violence and discrimination , and driving licenses for women			2
she said : " we suffer every day			0
the improvement process is so slow we wish the next step wo n't delay more			0
" the king mentioned very impressive and effective words in his speech towards women 's dignity and rights , we hope it 's an obligation to give @entity4 women back their dignity step by step			1
" @entity13 , too , wants to see an improvement in women 's rights , but believes sometimes the issue of driving has distracted from more important issues			1
" i would like to see women in the judiciary system as far more important for me			2
a car will come naturally if she is a supreme court judge or traveling without a permission			0

critics expect our work to address women 's rights , says @entity5
having women judges is more important than driving , she adds
people stereotype us as @entity4 women , says artist @entity6 - @entity6
