-- from a wing of the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , to the provincial capitol building in @entity8 , @entity9 to a spa resort in @entity11 , @entity2 's architecture has changed landscapes across the globe			1
in a partnership spanning more than 40 years , @entity2 and her husband and partner @entity14 both designed iconic buildings and changed attitudes with their theories and books			1
their efforts earned a @entity23 -- considered the greatest accolade in architecture -- for @entity14 in 1991			1
but , although the couple had always worked in partnership , @entity2 's name was not included in the prize			1
now , 22 years on , a group of young women architects is leading a campaign to retroactively include @entity2 on the prize			1
their petition has been signed by more than 11,000 people at time of writing , including no fewer than nine @entity23 laureates : @entity38 ( 2000 ) , @entity39 ( 2012 ) , @entity40 ( 2004 ) , @entity41 ( 1984 ) , @entity42 ( 1996 ) , @entity43 ( 1998 ) , @entity44 and @entity45 ( 2001 ) and @entity14 himself			1
@entity14 , now retired from architecture , wrote : " @entity2 is my inspiring and equal partner			1
" the campaign was inspired by a video message @entity2 recorded for the @entity50 's " @entity51 " lunch in @entity6 in march in which she raised the idea of an inclusion ceremony to recognize her in the prize			1
the message was picked up by @entity58 graduate architecture students @entity59 , 29 and her colleague @entity60 , 30 , who had just revived the school 's women in design group			2
watch : the woman behind @entity6 's @entity65 the architect at the age of 81 , @entity2 is still busy and in demand at architecture events , giving lectures and writing			1
she has just returned from @entity72 where she spoke to 3,000 people at the release of the @entity76 edition of her latest book , " having words			2
" her lifetime 's work includes not only several iconic buildings , but influential theories of architecture , books and teaching			2
her seminal book " learning from @entity88 , " written with @entity14 and @entity89 and published in 1972 , has been in print ever since and is still a standard text for architecture students			1
it argues that architects should take greater account of the tastes of ordinary people and move away from large , self - aggrandizing buildings			2
@entity2 told @entity0 that , as a woman , she had felt excluded by the elite of architecture throughout her career			1

" " by the 90s , we had to tell them we were not going to suffer in silence			0
" i watched the advent of women in my field			0
early on , if i went to a conference there would be one woman and one black in a hall with 500 white men			0
" she added : " i think what happened to me could still happen , some of the inequities remain			0
" she said the @entity23 was based on the fallacy that great architecture was the work of a " single lone male genius " at the expense of collaborative work			1
" it was n't just an oversight			0
they made a conscious decision not to include me , " she said			0
the campaigners @entity58 graduate student @entity59 was reading architecture blogs in her living room when she came across @entity2 's video message to the @entity50 and responses to it			2
" i felt there needed to be a support network to help make it a reality because i believe she deserved equal recognition , " she said			0
she contacted her colleague @entity60 who had just revived the @entity152 and the pair immediately began working on a change.org petition in march			2
now , the @entity156 campaign has generated over 11,000 signatures , nine of which are @entity23 winners			1
both young women were impressed by @entity2 as a pioneer female architect and through " learning from @entity88 " , which they had read during their studies			1
" she is a legend , " said @entity164 , adding that her omission from the prize had been " institutionalized sexism "			0
" our agenda is about recognizing equal creative participation in the field of architecture , " said @entity164			0
" our interest is not in disrespecting the @entity23 , but drawing attention to joint enterprise			2
it 's about raising awareness and creating a culture of intent to include not exclude people			0
" @entity59 added : " i would like to see the profession become more egalitarian			0
it 's important for this generation to speak out and ensure that there is some sort of responsibility by institutions to foster an environment that reflects what we want the profession to be			0
