@entity0 -- @entity3 war veteran @entity2 described his purchase of recreational marijuana -- legally -- as a historic moment wednesday			1
" it 's huge , " he said at a marijuana store along a light industrial corridor outside downtown @entity0			1
" it has n't even sunk in how big this is yet			0
" indeed , before the @entity13 opened at 8 a.m. mt , more than 100 people were waiting in snowfall and cold under gray skies to be the next buyers of recreational pot under a landmark law voters approved in 2012			1
the dispensary was one of a handful that opened to lines of waiting people on @entity24 , with scores more expected statewide in coming months			1
do you smoke pot ? tell us about it @entity2 was selected to be the first buyer at the @entity13 because he was a @entity32 from 2000 to 2006 who now suffers post-traumatic stress disorder after two tours in @entity3			1
he ca n't obtain medical marijuana in @entity37 because @entity38 is n't a qualifying condition for that treatment , he said			0
" this is what we worked so hard for the last few years , " he said of the voter - approved constitutional amendment that led @entity37 to become the first state in the nation to open recreational pot stores to anyone age 21 and older			1
" it 's mind - blowing			1
" @entity2 , 32 , bought an eighth of an ounce of pot , plus chocolate truffles laced with marijuana			1
those treats are called " edibles " at the store			0
the price : $ 59.50			0
the marijuana alleviates the anxiety and stress that come from @entity38 , he said , adding that he 'll smoke the pot wednesday evening			2
at several recreational weed stores , buyers waited in line for three or four hours to be a part of opening - day history			1
despite the hundreds of people queuing on public sidewalks , no significant problems emerged wednesday , @entity0 officials said			1
" i want to thank the businesses and consumers alike for acting responsibly and with great accountability today , " @entity0 mayor @entity73 said in a statement			1
" @entity0 is a progressive city , a vibrant city , and it 's incumbent on all of us to continue getting this right			1
" long lines even three hours after the stores opened , one downtown @entity0 dispensary had a line of about 100 people outside the front door to the corner			1
the snow had stopped falling by then , and the gray skies were clearing to blue			0
while patrons -- young and the old , men and women -- waited patiently in line , the demographic at the downtown dispensary tilted more toward 20 - and 30 - somethings			2
when many buyers emerged from the store and nudged through the line , they raised their bags of newly purchased pot above their heads			1
people waiting on the sidewalk cheered them			2
even though recreational weed is now legal , some purchasers declined to disclose their last names			2
one woman , @entity108 , who did n't want to use her surname , said she waited in line for almost three hours to buy her cannabis			2
she and a male companion bought a small amount , she said , just to commemorate the occasion			0
" we voted for it , and now it 's here , " @entity108 said of the recreational marijuana law			2
" we just went in and celebrated the new law			0
it 's a new day			2
" she did n't mind the long wait at the @entity124			0
" everybody is cool and mellow and nice			0
so it 's all good , " she said			2
some motorists passing the pot shop honked and cheered the queue of buyers , who whooped in return			1
one motorist , however , shouted a disparaging remark about the " potheads , " and the crowd muttered raspberries in response			0
buyers whiled away the hours in line by talking aloud about the benefits of marijuana as a remedy for hangovers , headaches , sleeplessness and low appetite			1
then a young woman in a passing suv slowed and interrupted them by asking , " what 's going on , guys ? " " legal pot sale ! " a man in line shouted			1
" oh , i need an eighth ! " the young woman shouted back excitedly			0
in fact , around 11:30 a.m. mt , @entity157 , whose family owns and runs the dispensary , announced to the waiting people on the sidewalk that he was being forced to limit sales to an eighth of an ounce to each person , though under the new state law , a resident can buy up to an ounce			2
the dispensary will close at 7 p.m. mt , but @entity157 said he may have to start turning people away at 4 p.m. the line had gone out the front door , down the street and around the corner by 2 p.m. mt , when more than 400 people had made purchases			1
in all , @entity157 counted buyers from several states and countries			2
buyers showed ids from @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 -- and even @entity189 and @entity190			1
other prospective weed buyers came from @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 , though the @entity194 man , 21 , walked away because he had to catch a bus for his tour of @entity198			1
south of downtown , the @entity199 was encountering the same phenomenon : 700 people in line took numbers , but employees said they might not be able to serve all of them by the close of business			1
the atmosphere at the dispensaries was clearly celebratory and cheerful			0
for example , about 10 miles outside of downtown , one man said he had waited in the snow since 2:30 a.m. for the @entity217 dispensary to open at 8 a.m. when asked how he felt after making the first sale there , he responded : " i 'll feel better in an hour			1
" applauding , criticizing the new law even before the weed went on sale , enthusiasts were anticipating the end of an era			2
" @entity230 is over , " blared a flier for @entity228 festivities at @entity229 in @entity0			1
" celebrate cannabis freedom in style			0
" as many as 30 stores throughout @entity37 will sell recreational weed			0
of the estimated 30 stores , 18 are in @entity0			1
" with @entity240 next to implement marijuana legalization and other states strongly considering enacting similar laws , we believe this marks the beginning of the end of the nation 's decades - long war on marijuana and its harmful human and fiscal toll , " @entity236 , a director at the @entity237 , said in a prepared statement			2
but not everyone was applauding			0
" legalization -- with all of the @entity198 - style promotion that will accompany it -- is the last thing people in recovery , parents , communities -- and even our nation -- need right now , " @entity253 said on its website			2
a total of 136 stores received state licenses last week , but most apparently had not obtained approval yet from their local governments to open on january 1			0
in 2012 , @entity37 voters approved the sale of recreational marijuana , as did voters in @entity240			2
but @entity37 is the first to have the pot shops up and running under regulations recently established by state and local governments			1
@entity37 voters ' approval in effect amended the state 's constitution to allow for the retail sale of recreational pot. the state already allows medical marijuana			1
limits to marijuana consumption not all of the state is participating in the new law			0
a community can decide not to allow the shops , and in fact , most of the state geographically has n't , including communities such as @entity297 and @entity298			2
proponents of the new law were dealt a setback last week when @entity0 and state officials threatened to shut down a private party at a dance club scheduled for january 1 celebrating the end of the prohibition against cannabis -- an event billed as " @entity309			1
" the organizers canceled the party because officials said it would violate a @entity0 ordinance prohibiting the public consumption of marijuana			1
cannabis can only be smoked on private property with the owner 's permission			2
under the new state law , residents are now able to buy marijuana like alcohol			0
the cannabis purchase is limited to an ounce , which is substantial enough to cost about $ 200 or more			0
people from out of state can buy up to a quarter - ounce			0
in a vivid example of how recreational pot is a new reality for the state , @entity0 officials posted public signs in the tourist - populated corridor known as the @entity334			1
the street signs read , " @entity336 in @entity0			1
" " you must be 21 or older to have or use retail marijuana , " says one bulletin on the sign			0
but further below it , the sign warns readers that " it is illegal to use , display or transfer marijuana on the @entity334			0
" one of @entity37 's main media outlets , the @entity347 , has even devoted a website to the history - making moment and its ongoing impact			0
" the culture of cannabis , that 's what we 're here to talk about , " says the newspaper 's " @entity354 " page			0
" as marijuana 's coming - out continues , we 'll report journalistically from our homebase in @entity0 , @entity37 -- the site of recreational marijuana 's first legal sale in the modern world on jan. 1 , 2014			1
" this week , @entity367 authorities banned all marijuana on the airport grounds			0
medical marijuana had been legal to bring to the airport as long as it did n't go through security checkpoints , said airport spokeswoman @entity373			0
but a total ban was implemented to avoid confusion as the recreational pot law rolls out , she said			0
officials are concerned that a large influx of people may take marijuana to the airport and transport it across state lines			0
so if a visitor brings marijuana to the airport and leaves it in the car to pick up a relative at the terminal , that visitor will be breaking the law and could face a fine of up to $ 999 , @entity373 said			0
@entity37 becomes the first place in the world where marijuana will be regulated from seed to sale			0
pot is the third most popular recreational drug in @entity198 , after alcohol and tobacco , according to the marijuana reform group @entity402			0
@entity1 's @entity403 and @entity404 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity0 mayor says pot shops , buyers behaved " responsibly and with great accountability "
pot buyers at one shop come from @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity190 , @entity189
700 people in line take numbers at another pot shop , but can it serve so many ?
" what 's going on ? " a curious *passenger* asks ; " legal pot sale ! " a man in line replies
