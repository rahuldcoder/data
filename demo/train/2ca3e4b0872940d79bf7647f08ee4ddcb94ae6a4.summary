-- president @entity1 will convene a summit monday at the @entity3 of the heads of every key @entity6 nation -- except three : ebola - plagued @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
and as of now , the @entity6 @entity11 epidemic , the largest on record , is not officially on the summit agenda			1
as their epidemics spin out of control in a contagion more than three times larger than any prior @entity11 outbreak , presidents @entity20 of @entity7 , @entity21 © of @entity8 and @entity22 of @entity9 are staying home			1
they are taking drastic measures in hopes of slowing the spread of the deadly hemorrhagic disease : banning public gatherings , closing schools , deploying their armies to stop attacks on health workers and maintain quarantines			0
it is tragic that @entity20 , @entity36 and @entity22 will not be able to plead their nations ' cases at the @entity3 summit because their countries desperately need help			2
there is great danger that the fear of the virus spreading globally will stigmatize @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity8 , and that their @entity6 neighbors -- especially @entity48 -- will try to ward off @entity11 by isolating the countries in ways that will hurt their fragile economies , further imperiling the health of their people			1
it is time to take a cold , clear look at the implications of this out - of - control epidemic and think carefully about what steps the international community should take next			2
the outbreak began in @entity8 in march and has spread slowly , inexorably in the three desperately poor countries for months			2
it reached dangerous epidemic scale in june , but only as july draws to its end has it registered with urgency with international media and political leaders			0
why now ? because two @entity71 volunteers are fighting for their lives in the region , and a third @entity71 succumbed to @entity11 in @entity74 , @entity48 , having acquired his infection in @entity7			1
the specter of @entity11 spreading via air travel to @entity48 , the most populous @entity6 nation , prompted the @entity80 government to issue a national medical alert this week			1
the fear also threatens the creation of a vast cordon sanitaire -- or barrier -- around the three afflicted countries			0
short - term focus on @entity11 control can not be disconnected from a longer term commitment to economic and technical support of these nations ' health care systems , roads , schools and general development			1
these countries face @entity11 today , but they also contend with @entity98 fever virus , which also causes hemorrhagic disease			2
there also are mosquitoes carrying yellow fever and malaria , and a long list of microbial dangers are always lurking in their rainforests			0
to show how ill - equipped these nations are to battle disease , per capita spending on health care , combining personal and governmental , amounts to only $ 171 a year in @entity9 , $ 88 a year in @entity7 and $ 67 a year in @entity8 , according to the @entity112			1
there is also a dire shortage of health care workers			0
before the @entity11 epidemic claimed the lives of several of the nations ' leading physicians and nurses , @entity7 had 0.014 physicians per 1,000 people ; @entity9 's doctor - to - patient ratio was 0.022 and @entity8 's was 0.1			1
to put that in perspective , rich countries have a thousand times more physicians per capita			0
in the @entity71 , there are 2.5 doctors per 1,000 people			0
when this @entity11 epidemic eventually ends , the health budgets of these nations will have been bankrupted , and many of their most skilled and courageous physicians , nurses , @entity131 volunteers and hospital workers will have perished			1
@entity48 is the tipping point			2
were @entity11 to take hold in that country , spreading from person - to - person in a densely populated , chaotic city such as @entity74 , the worldwide response would swiftly spin into uncharted political and global health territory			2
consider the following : @entity48 physicians are on strike nationwide ; hundreds of girls have been kidnapped from their schools and villages over the past six months by @entity150 militants -- and none has been successfully freed from their captors by the @entity154 government			0
@entity48 is in the midst of national election campaigning			0
president @entity158 's government is , at best , weak			0
the nation is torn apart by religious tension , pitting the @entity162 north against the @entity164 south			0
islamists in the north have long distrusted @entity167 medicine			0
they have opposed polio vaccination and have kidnapped and assaulted central government health providers			0
@entity48 , the most populous nation in @entity171 , has just surpassed @entity171 as its richest			1
it has a large , elite class that is highly mobile			0
its international airports buzz with activity as hundreds of thousands of @entity48 travel all over @entity171 , take college studies in @entity176 and @entity177 , visit second homes in @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and other cities , and conduct business on the international stage			1
@entity9 , @entity8 and @entity7 are three of the poorest , most remote nations on @entity186 while @entity48 is @entity171 's muscle , hustle and oil			1
one way or another , @entity1 must take advantage of monday 's @entity171 summit to press the case for calm and appropriate responses			1
these would include specific @entity197 financial commitments to @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity8			1
the possibility that the epidemic might take hold in @entity48 must be confronted , and plans of action must be considered			2
the world can not afford to make decisions in the heat of panic about such things as international airport closures , withdrawal of foreign oil workers , negotiations for outbreak responses with northern imams , hospital and clinic infection control training across thousands of @entity48 health facilities , deployment of international assistance teams for rapid diagnostics and lab assistance and countless other contingencies			2
roughly 70 % of diagnosed @entity11 patients in this epidemic have perished			2
the potential for global panic is genuine			0
if responsible leaders worldwide hope to stave off hysterical reactions to the virus and bring this epidemic to a halt , serious contingencies and agreements must be reached immediately			0
please , president @entity1 , do not squander the opportunity to place such contingency planning on your monday summit agenda			1
as @entity239 talk show host @entity238 asked me on her show , " ca n't the @entity3 put @entity242 and @entity22 on @entity243 , to plead their case to the summit ? " that would be a start .			0

president @entity1 's @entity171 summit does not have @entity11 epidemic on agenda
record - breaking epidemic hits *poverty* - stricken @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9
@entity255 : we need to make long - term commitment to @entity11 - struck nations
@entity260 : @entity261 urgently needs to *address* this and plan for the worst if it hits populous @entity48
