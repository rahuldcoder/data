-- with a straight face and a shrug , world motorcycling champion @entity1 details the danger involved in reaching the sport 's dizzying pinnacle : " i had my first injury at age seven			1
" for most of the last 18 years his body has absorbed a litany of crashes -- some at speeds of 150 miles per hour as he contests the elite @entity14 competition which he has now won twice			1
" on my wrist , maybe twice , and as for my collar bone -- five , six times			2
my head , so many			0
" he catalogs these events as if reeling off a shopping list , pausing briefly to explain that one of them , at a @entity23 circuit in 2008 , left him unable to remember anything for " two or three days			1
" the riders , whose bikes cost millions of dollars , get so close to the ground when racing that they not only touch the tarmac with their highly - padded knees , but also their elbows			1
" too much pain , too many injuries , " @entity1 told @entity0 's human to @entity32			1
" it 's almost 20 years that i have injures , have crashes			0
it 's normal when you are a rider , it sometimes happens , no ? " given this gruesome roll call , it is a wonder the @entity44 's mind is n't submerged by dread as he tears round the track but it is with a softer , more sensuous tone that @entity1 explains his relationship with the motorbike that so often puts him in harm 's way			1
" it 's like dancing , " he said			0
" when you dance with a girl , you do n't think			0
just hear the music and just move			0
" at the beginning when you do n't know how to dance you have to think how to put the feet and how to move your body			0
" but when you do it for so many times , then you do n't think			0
just flow , no ? that 's the same for the bike on the track when you are a professional rider			1
" change of tack @entity67 to such an ingrained in - race mentality has come from his history of hard knocks , but his past also pivots on a decision to race smarter , not faster			1
the crash which accounted for his temporary memory loss marked a watershed in his career			0
it was the fifth consecutive meeting in which he 'd toppled off his bike			0
it signaled a necessary change of approach that paved the way for him to realize his dream of becoming @entity14 champion in 2010 and 2012			1
" i was an aggressive rider in the past , " he explained			1
" then the first year in @entity14 i still was an aggressive rider			1
i injured myself many times			1
" in 2008 i had my fifth consecutive crash in @entity92 in 2008			0
and i hit my head in one crash twice or three times , bump bump bump bump ... so much			0
i did n't remember anything for about two or three days			0
" so at this time i told myself , ' i have to change			0
' or change my way of riding			2
i became more calm , more clever , or thinking ( about ) more things i do on the bike , or i stop riding			2
" and now i 'm much more different			0
i 'm different and normally i do n't crash so much			0
last year i crashed maybe twice			0
" broken ankles if the frequency of these crashes is hard to compute , the desire for @entity1 and his peers to race at all costs is even more mind - boggling			1
after a nasty smash during practice ahead of the @entity112 @entity14 in 2008 -- his self - confessed reckless period -- @entity1 broke both his ankles			1
yet he still took part in the race , securing fourth place			1
he had to be lifted off his bike once he 'd finished			0
@entity1 's new stealth on the track was evident in the 2010 season as he charged to his first @entity14 title			1
he won nine grands prix and showcased his new - found maturity by finishing on the podium in 16 out of 18 races			2
it marked the realization of a dream that was formed at five years old and , alongside his first ever world title in the 250cc division , it is @entity1 's proudest achievement in a sport that has dominated his life			1
bike - mad upbringing if his epiphany at five sparked a desire to win the world title , his love for bikes came even earlier growing up in @entity140 , part of @entity23 's @entity142 and also the home of tennis star @entity144			1
" i started to practice at three years old with a bike that my dad started to build , handmade , for me , " he said			2
" my first race was at three years old , but i did n't have the license			2
i was crying because i wanted to race			2
the boss of the race saw me crying and he said , ' okay , you can race			2
but i did n't have the license , so i had to wait two more years to get the license			0
" i started at five to race constantly			1
trial , motocross , minicross , scooter , pocket bikes			2
everything i could do , and my father could offer me			0
" and then in 1997 , i started to race around all of @entity23 in world racing			1
then at 14 i signed with @entity162 , a @entity23 brand , for the 125cc world championship			1
" ' the most important thing ' he revs himself up ahead of races by listening to @entity167 rockers @entity166 ( " because it gives me a lot of power " ) but afterwards @entity1 needs to take the edge off the adrenalin rush			1
" i do some meditation , some yoga			0
i stay relaxed , just breathing and not thinking anything for five minutes			0
and i finish completely relaxed			0
" @entity1 's rise through the ranks of motorbike racing now sees him @entity178 -- a place he intends to maintain when the 2013 season kicks off in @entity181 this april			1
" the competitive goal must be trying to fight again for the world championship , " he said			2
" but i always try every year to grow as a rider , and especially as a person			2
" to improve my weak points , and try to keep the good points i have			0
but to grow -- grow as a person , and as a rider			2
it 's the most important thing			0
