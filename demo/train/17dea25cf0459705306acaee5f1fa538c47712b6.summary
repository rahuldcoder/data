-- it 's like a scene out of " @entity3			1
" rows upon rows of giant robot arms weave in and out of a tightly packed assembly line of unpainted car skeletons			1
there are no humans in sight -- just huge machines working in jerks and spasms , but quickly , each massive arm doing something different			2
some spew sparks and fire , some brush , some drill			2
others wipe or probe with their strangely shaped tips			0
from a second floor glass bridge inside @entity30 's @entity29 plant , our tour group stares down at production lines on either side of us , noses pressed to the glass			1
" ninety - six percent of the production process is completed by robots , " says our guide , who may or may not be a robot herself , if her monotone delivery is a hint			1
" thirty workers take care of the robots			0
they have an average life of 10 to 12 years			0
" the robots , that is			0
this giant factory full of giant robots produces cars for the world 's best selling automaker -- @entity30 sold 9.98 million vehicles in 2013			1
" we need to talk about your @entity52 reports			1
" studied at universities and schools around the world , the @entity52 is considered by many to be the most well - run and efficient self - correcting production system in the world although @entity30 has been remarkably transparent about its renowned system -- opening its plants to anyone who wants to observe or study them -- emulators ( automotive and beyond ) have struggled to match its remarkable success			1
" many companies have focused on tangible ' artifacts ' of the @entity30 approach , " says @entity67 , senior lecturer at the @entity68 and co-author of the @entity71 article " decoding the dna of the @entity52			1
" " very few have recognized and incorporated the high speed learning dynamic that is essential			0
the differential results between the tool - oriented imitators and the behavior - oriented emulators are profound			0
" the company itself officially explains its system this way : " the practical expression of @entity30 's people and customer - oriented philosophy is known as the @entity52 ( @entity52 )			1
this is not a rigid company - imposed procedure but a set of principles that have been proven in day - to - day practice over many years			0
" future on display located two train rides and a short cab trip from @entity100 , the tour begins at the @entity101 , a bland - looking building at the automaker 's headquarters			1
while 50 % of the company 's 69,000 employees are located in this area , between the train station and @entity30 's headquarters there 's hardly anyone in sight			1
the building 's exterior looks pure , corporate generic			2
inside its glass doors , however , things get futuristic			0
hologram engine displays , alien - like vehicles and @entity122 1 - winning cars glisten on the floor			2
fascinating as they all are , one exhibit demands my attention -- a slender , blue and white robot that starts playing the trumpet			0
i 'd heard about this robot , with its piston - powered lungs and rubber lips ; i was n't prepared for how stirring its music would be			0
the notes are tender , the vibrato , achingly human			0
if i were a musician , i think , i 'd be worried about the future of my profession			0
alongside the trumpet - playing robot is a scaled - down replica of the @entity52 , a safety simulator that works like an arcade game and a new @entity145 bike			1
auto pilgrims after the museum , it 's time for the @entity29 plant tour , located 15 minutes away			1
we 're taken there , of course , on a @entity30 bus			1
all phones and cameras are left behind in lockers			0
the tour is well off @entity160 's mainstream tourist path -- most visitors have to travel several hours out of their way to get here			1
there are nine people in my @entity166 - language tour group -- a mix of nationalities			2
all are rapt with attention throughout the tour			2
@entity172 , a traveler from @entity173 , arrived on the train from @entity175 the same morning			0
he tells me he once ran a chocolate factory in @entity173 that adopted the @entity52 ; he 's always wanted to check out the production line in person			1
" it 's so amazing to see how calm and easygoing the atmosphere is in spite of the incredible quality control , " he says			2
three @entity184 engineers who are backpacking through @entity160 say the @entity30 stop is a priority of their trip			1
during the bus ride , our guide tells us a quirky fact about @entity30 's name			1
although the founding family 's name was @entity195 , the name of the company was switched to @entity30 as the latter requires eight strokes to write in @entity160 , and eight is considered a lucky number			1
mama the welding factory is the site of the terminator - like scene of robotic arms working as fire and sparks shoot over car frames			2
this plant produces 70,000 cars per year , or approximately 400 per day			2
that breaks down to a vehicle being completed every 135 seconds			1
more than 30,000 parts go into each car , and the plant houses 760 robots			1
after the welding plant , many more human workers fill the assembly line			2
we walk through a series of bridges above the workers , who glance up occasionally and smile at us while working on car guts			2
constant " ding dong " sounds chime in the background , making us feel like we 're in a giant video game arcade			0
these sounds are actually part of a " @entity230 " pull system			0
they signal that something has gone wrong or a problem has been detected and a worker has called for a supervisor			0
yet the lines keep moving quickly			0
another geeky fact shared by our guide : @entity30 invented a " doorless system , " meaning they take the doors off the cars so that workers can get in and out of the car more quickly to assemble parts			1
the doors are re-attached later in the assembly line			0
at the end of the tour , we play a series of timed games meant to demonstrate the remarkable skills required of @entity30 's plant workers			1
one involves looping ropes on pegs , and screwing and unscrewing bolts			0
another feels like a less - colorful version of @entity261			0
the entire tour takes two and half hours			2
when it 's time to head back to the museum and visit the gift shop , i find a large display featuring boxes of car - themed curry , of all things			1
i buy one , of course -- at least under factory conditions , everything @entity30 produces looks incredible			1
