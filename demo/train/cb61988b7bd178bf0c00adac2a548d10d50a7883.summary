is a 36 - year - old virgin and impatient to do something about it			1
but he 's also a good @entity4 , which complicates matters			2
and then there 's his domestic situation : he spends most of the day horizontal , in the iron lung , a cylinder that looks a bit like a torpedo tube , that helps him breathe			0
since he was struck with polio as a child , @entity1 ca n't survive outside this apparatus for more than four hours at a time and even then requires a gurney to get about			1
he tries not to let it cramp his style , but this is not a lifestyle conducive to courtship and seduction			0
we 've seen films about severely disabled artists before ( @entity27 picking up a paintbrush in " @entity29 , " @entity30 writing his autobiography a blink at a time in " @entity33 " ) but rarely about their sex lives			0
based on poet and journalist @entity37 's memoir " @entity38 , " " @entity38 " has a different set of priorities			0
it 's a given that @entity1 can write , but whether he can get it on with a woman , that 's another question entirely , and a far more intriguing proposition			1
a romantic crush on his caregiver comes to nothing , she does n't love him " that way , " but someone recommends professional help : a sex surrogate			0
@entity54 ( @entity55 ) , married , discreet , patient and practical enough to take a very nervous and over-excitable client through his paces over half a dozen assignations			0
it 's a @entity61 © that actors playing disabled always win accolades , but these are also technically demanding roles , so why not ? @entity2 , known for breakout roles in indie hits " @entity73 , " " @entity72 " and " @entity68 , " is terrific here : emaciated , bony , funny , his voice high - pitched and nasal , both confident in himself and oh so vulnerable			1
it 's good to see @entity55 back too in what feels like her best movie role in a decade ; she 's forthright , tender and ultimately left high and dry by an unusually abrupt third act			0
kudos to @entity79 and @entity80 as well , for their deft comic underplaying as another of @entity1 's nurses and the motel receptionist curious to know the nature of this weekly therapy			1
as are we , and this light but poignant crowd - pleaser of a movie does n't disappoint on that score			0
writer - director @entity92 , a veteran who has worked mostly ( but intermittently ) in tv , builds on the sexual candor pioneered largely by cable series and @entity97 - style comedies over the past decade or so			0
typically , that involves full - frontal nudity for @entity55 , but not for @entity2			1
this conventional chauvinism aside , and adopting confessionals with @entity1 's long - haired priest ( @entity103 ) as a comic safety valve , the film is refreshingly frank about the nuts and bolts of physical intercourse , as well as the more complex emotional exchange that is taking place			1
what 's the difference between a surrogate and a prostitute ? @entity114 does n't want the money upfront , and she does n't want repeat business either ( six sessions and that 's it , she warns him )			2
but what passes between them is too intimate , too personal to be strictly business , at least from where @entity1 is lying			2
does @entity114 see it differently ? @entity92 suggests she too is touched by the experience ; not by the sex itself , but rather the effect it has on @entity1 , and his ability to put it into words			2
is that just movie romanticism ? maybe so , but " @entity38 " is a very different kind of love story , breaking taboos lightly , with sensitivity and humor .			1
