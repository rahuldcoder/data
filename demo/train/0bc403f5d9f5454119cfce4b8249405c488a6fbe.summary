-- we are well into the fall season , so by now , you probably have had your fill of pumpkin and @entity7 beers , so now is the time to give a fresh hop beer a try			1
@entity12 is harvest time for the hop growers of the @entity15 , where a majority of hops are grown in the @entity18 while most of the hops picked are dried and preserved , some hops are spared from the drying kiln and sent directly to brewers within 24 - 48 hours			1
these hops are referred to as " wet hops			1
" whole fresh hop cones provide a more grassy and juicy aroma and flavor to the beer by retaining precious lupulin oils from the hop flower			1
@entity31 hop beers are the ultimate example of farm - to - glass , and are designed to celebrate the agriculture of beer			1
@entity36 in @entity37 and @entity38 obviously have an advantage in getting the freshest picked hops , but more and more breweries outside of the hop growing regions are going to extreme lengths to get the freshest hops into the brew kettle			2
i gathered as many of these " freshies " as i could get my hands on for a taste test , along with a group of fellow beer lovers , and have listed the cream of the crop			2
these harvest ales wo n't be available much longer , so you better hop to it and try some today			2
please share your favorite wet hop beer in the comments below			2
@entity62 -- @entity63 @entity63 has been brewing up wet hop beers since 1996 , so they have got it down			1
they even produce a wet hop beer from hops grown on their estate in @entity69 , @entity70			1
the fresh @entity72 and @entity73 hops give this balanced beer some citrus and herbal notes , but they 're not overpowering			2
definite pine and grassy notes crop up at the end , but the sweetness from the malts calm things down a bit			0
born yesterday @entity84 -- @entity85 this was the clear front - runner this year in the wet hop category			0
the freshness of this pale ale really shines through from beginning to end			0
tropical fruits and pine hit you across the face right upon opening it up , and it should , considering the lengths that @entity85 went through in order to get this beer in your hands as fresh as possible			0
the wet hops are truly the star of this pale ale			1
harvest ale -- @entity106 who knew that one of the best wet hopped beers would be straight out of @entity110 , @entity111 ? it 's a brilliantly juiced up ipa with intense pine and tropical fruit flavor			2
the fresh hops shine all the way through to the finish			0
according the brewery , fresh hops from both @entity38 and @entity111 were used in this year 's batch of their delicious harvest ale			0
@entity124 ' @entity123 -- @entity125 this ipa features fresh cut @entity127 hops trucked in straight from the fields in nearby @entity130 , @entity38			0
tropical notes are again showcased in this one , along with heavy pine and subtle bread - y sweetness			0
@entity134 and crisp , and a very easy drinker for 7.2 % alcohol by volume			0
@entity125 also serves up a fresh hop pale ale called @entity139 , which is worth a try as well			1
so @entity140 , @entity141 -- @entity142 each year @entity142 pays tribute to the hop by featuring a single wet hop that is flown down on a midnight plane to @entity147 from @entity130			0
this year @entity142 features @entity148 , which is a heavily aromatic hop that gives lots of earthy pine and passionfruit characteristics			0
this brew tastes like a freshly mowed lawn of pine needles , with a fruity slightly bitter finish			0
it is a truly another one hop wonder from @entity142			0
@entity159 -- @entity160 this is one juicy fresh hop beer , which is surprising given its very drinkable 4.7 % @entity162			1
@entity163 's @entity160 uses only seedless hop cones in this session @entity112 to deliver a citrus - y but not at all bitter brew			1
@entity168 to @entity169 -- @entity170 a very ambitious undertaking by @entity169 to get a whopping six tons of fresh hops hauled in refrigerated trucks from @entity174 to their @entity176 , @entity177 , brewery for this fresh hop offering			1
tons of grapefruit and a pungent hop aroma lead the way , alongside @entity169 's signature malts , provide a bread - y sweetness			2
fresh hop -- @entity186 another early adopter of the wet hop movement , @entity186 give us a pale ale with grassy hop flavor with heavy grapefruit and a little pine on the finish			1
@entity196 bitterness and an all - around well balanced beer			0
warrior ipa -- @entity198 probably the only wet hop beer on the list not featuring @entity15 hops			1
warrior is made with fresh wet cascade hops from the high altitudes of @entity204			1
once harvested , the hops are loaded onto a small plane and flown about an hour to the @entity207 in @entity208 , @entity204			0
heavy - handed ipa -- @entity210 @entity210 from @entity211 put out three separate versions of their heavy handed fresh hop @entity112 , with each one featuring a single hop			2
this year they have released them in @entity217 , @entity72 and @entity73			0
we were able to get our hands on the @entity73 version of this beer			0
the @entity222 was probably sweeter than most of the fresh hop beers we tried , with a caramel flavors with a citrus twist .			1
