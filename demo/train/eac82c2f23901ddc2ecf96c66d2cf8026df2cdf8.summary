@entity0 -- a single man stood silently in @entity0 's @entity3 for hours monday night , defying police who broke up weekend anti-government protests with tear gas and water cannon and drawing hundreds of others to his vigil			1
for more than five hours , he appeared to stare at a portrait of @entity13 , the founder of the modern @entity15 state			0
police eventually moved in to arrest many of those who joined him , but whether @entity18 -- a performance artist quickly dubbed the " standing man " -- was in custody was unclear early tuesday			1
@entity15 has been wracked by more than two weeks of protests against the government of prime minister @entity23			1
but many of those who joined @entity26 late monday said they were standing only for peace , not taking sides			0
monday 's hushed tableau came two days after police swept into @entity3 and neighboring @entity31 to clear out @entity33 protesters			1
the demonstrators tried to return to the park on sunday , only to be driven back by police			2
trade unions put fresh pressure on @entity23 earlier monday , mounting a nationwide strike			1
but a crowd that marched on @entity3 dispersed when faced with riot squads backed by water cannon			1
the protests started at the end of may over authorities ' plans to turn @entity31 , central @entity0 's last green space , into a mall			2
they quickly turned into large anti-government demonstrations that included calls for political reforms			0
' there is a level of desperation ' while the protests are unlikely to threaten the rule of @entity23 , who has been one of @entity15 's most popular leaders and is credited with overseeing a decade of economic growth , they are raising questions about what critics say is an increasingly authoritarian style of governing			1
@entity66 : wedding in the midst of teargas some groups of demonstrators have shifted to protesting in their local neighborhoods in the city , putting up barricades			0
meanwhile , the atmosphere in confrontations between police and protesters is turning uglier			1
" now it feels like there is a level of desperation , " said @entity78 , who was vacationing in @entity0 from @entity79 for the past week			0
" the police seem more comfortable with using aggression			2
" since saturday night , 116 people have been detained during protests in @entity87 and 242 people have been detained in @entity0 demonstrations , said @entity90 , general secretary of the @entity91			2
@entity23 remains defiant , accusing outsiders of taking advantage of the protests over the park			1
on sunday , thousands of his supporters gathered at a rally a few miles from @entity3 , waving flags and singing songs at a rally that was widely viewed as a re-election rally for the prime minister			1
@entity23 sought to contrast his supporters with the protesters			1
" hundreds of thousands in here are not like the vandals with petrol - bombs in their hands , " he said			0
one - day strike after the weekend tumult , the trade unions added their clout to the demonstrations with their one - day strike			1
the unions involved have hundreds of thousands of members across sectors that include public services and utilities such as electricity and water supply			0
they do n't , however , have enough members to shut those industries down altogether			0
under the @entity23 government , @entity15 workers have been " domesticated like animals by being kept hungry , " one worker at a union office in @entity0 said			1
" @entity31 made us realize we are not animals in a herd ; we are individuals , " said the worker , who did n't provide his name			0
the previous strike during the anti-government demonstrations took place near the start of this month			2
@entity23 complained saturday that demonstrators were not meeting him halfway			1
" we have reached out with our hands , " he said			0
" however , some people returned their fists in response			0
can you shake hands with those who reach out with a fist ? " he also ridiculed the protesters ' assertions that they are environmentalists , calling them " thugs " and citing their honking of horns as evidence of " noise pollution			2
" and he accused demonstrators of inciting sectarian violence by attacking a woman in a headscarf , kicking her , dragging her on the ground and snatching her head cover			0
@entity23 praised his government 's performance over the past 10 years , citing a rising standard of living , a quintupling of the central bank 's reserves and plans to build an airport			1
root of protests the unrest began in @entity0 roughly three weeks ago , when a small group of people turned out to protest government plans to bulldoze @entity31 and replace it with a shopping mall housed inside a replica of 19th century @entity177 barracks			1
protesters said the plans represented a creeping infringement on their rights in a secular society			2
@entity15 was founded after secularists defeated @entity185 @entity177 forces in the early 20th century , and many modern - day secularists frown on @entity177 symbols			0
the protests broadened into an outpouring in the square and throughout the country as security forces cracked down on demonstrators			0
the unrest also brought political risks for @entity23 , a populist and democratically elected politician serving his third term in office			2
journalist @entity200 and @entity1 's @entity201 reported from @entity0 , and journalist @entity202 reported from @entity87			0
@entity1 's @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 in @entity0 and @entity206 in @entity87 contributed to this report .			0
