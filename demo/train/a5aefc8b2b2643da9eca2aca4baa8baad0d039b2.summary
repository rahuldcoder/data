it 's a question that 's been burning ever since the moment gunmen stormed the @entity4 office of @entity5 : are there other attackers out there ? it 's very likely , @entity10 prime minister @entity9 said			1
" we are doing everything we can to dismantle what appears to be a network			2
... no doubt there was complicity and networks and maybe finance also , " he told @entity1 's @entity17			1
investigators are still trying to piece together who was behind the @entity24 terror attacks that killed 17 people			2
clues have emerged tying the attackers to a man who was once @entity29 's top recruiter in @entity30 , and to training with @entity32 in @entity33			2
@entity34 and @entity35 , blamed for wednesday 's attack on @entity5 magazine , are dead			2
so is @entity38 , who authorities say killed a police officer , carried out an attack at a kosher market and might have shot a jogger			1
it 's not clear how many people might have helped them plot last week 's attacks			2
but @entity9 said they could n't have done it without help			1
" i do n't really believe in the idea of the lone wolf , " he said			1
a key player who could help unravel details is @entity56 , @entity38 's partner and alleged accomplice			2
early reports said she was by his side during the hostage siege at the kosher market			2
but now , investigators believe she was far from @entity4 when the attacks unfolded			0
@entity56 arrived in @entity67 from @entity68 on january 2 -- five days before the first attack in @entity4 , @entity67 's @entity66 news agency reports			0
@entity56 stayed at an @entity72 hotel and then traveled to @entity73 on thursday , @entity70 said			0

there investigators discovered @entity83 flags , automatic weapons and detonators at an apartment rented out by @entity38 , @entity56 's partner and suspected co-conspirator , @entity10 's @entity79 reported , citing authorities			1
authorities are looking into whether @entity56 helped prepare the attacks before leaving @entity10 , @entity9 told @entity1			1
and there 's another concern , a @entity92 intelligence official told @entity1 : now that she is believed to have escaped to @entity73 , @entity56 could be used in propaganda videos to gloat about the attacks			0
@entity10 was on its highest alert level monday as people went back to work and children returned to schools following the attacks			1
at least 10,000 soldiers and 8,000 police officers will be deployed across the country , @entity10 media reported			1

a @entity119 employee is credited with helping hide some hostages in a walk - in freezer , which he turned off			0

some 3.7 million people marched in anti-terrorism rallies sunday across @entity10 , including 1.5 million in @entity4			1
about 40 world leaders joined in the march in the @entity10 capital			1
police said no incidents had been reported despite the record number of people involved in the @entity4 rally			2
still , @entity10 law enforcement officers have been told to erase their social media presence and carry weapons at all times because terror sleeper cells have been activated in the country , a police source said			1
investigators are looking into whether the attackers last week were part of a larger cell and , if so , when it may strike again , @entity9 told @entity1 's @entity17			0
the threats go well beyond @entity10			1
the @entity172 and other @entity92 law enforcement agencies responded to a threat from @entity83 after someone released again a september message that tells followers to " rise up and kill intelligence officers , police officers , soldiers , and civilians " -- specifically naming the @entity92 , @entity10 , @entity182 and @entity183 as targets			1
