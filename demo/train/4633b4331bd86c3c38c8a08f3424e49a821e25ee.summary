yes , the @entity0 was a war for oil , and it was a war with winners : @entity3			2
it has been 10 years since @entity0 's bombs first landed in @entity6			0
and while most of the @entity10 - led coalition forces have long since gone , @entity8 oil companies are only getting started			1
before the 2003 invasion , @entity12 's domestic oil industry was fully nationalized and closed to @entity8 oil companies			1
a decade of war later , it is largely privatized and utterly dominated by foreign firms			2
from @entity19 and @entity20 to @entity21 and @entity22 , the @entity18 's largest oil companies have set up shop in @entity12			1
so have a slew of @entity10 oil service companies , including @entity26 , the @entity28 - based firm @entity29 ran before becoming @entity31 's running mate in 2000			2
the war is the one and only reason for this long sought and newly acquired access			0
full coverage : the @entity0 , 10 years on oil was not the only goal of the @entity0 , but it was certainly the central one , as top @entity10 military and political figures have attested to in the years following the invasion			1
" of course it 's about oil ; we ca n't really deny that , " said gen. @entity43 , former head of @entity44 and military operations in @entity12 , in 2007			2
former @entity51 chairman @entity50 agreed , writing in his memoir , " i am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the @entity12 war is largely about oil			0
" then - sen. and now defense secretary @entity59 said the same in 2007 : " people say we 're not fighting for oil			1
" for the first time in about 30 years , @entity8 oil companies are exploring for and producing oil in @entity12 from some of the world 's largest oil fields and reaping enormous profit			1
and while the @entity10 has also maintained a fairly consistent level of @entity12 oil imports since the invasion , the benefits are not finding their way through @entity12 's economy or society			2
these outcomes were by design , the result of a decade of @entity10 government and oil company pressure			0
in 1998 , @entity82 , then ceo of @entity20 , said , " @entity12 possesses huge reserves of oil and gas - reserves i 'd love @entity20 to have access to			0
exclusive : @entity88 on ' terrible mistake ' in @entity12 in 2000 , @entity3 , including @entity90 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , spent more money to get fellow oilmen @entity31 and @entity29 into office than they had spent on any previous election			2
just over a week into @entity31 's first term , their efforts paid off when the @entity97 , chaired by @entity29 , was formed , bringing the administration and the oil companies together to plot our collective energy future			1
in march , the task force reviewed lists and maps outlining @entity12 's entire oil productive capacity			0
planning for a military invasion was soon under way			0
@entity31 's first treasury secretary , @entity109 , said in 2004 , " already by february ( 2001 ) , the talk was mostly about logistics			0
not the why ( to invade @entity12 ) , but the how and how quickly			0
" in its final report in may 2001 ( @entity114 ) , the task force argued that @entity116 countries should be urged " to open up areas of their energy sectors to foreign investment			0
" this is precisely what has been achieved in @entity12			0
here 's how they did it			0
the @entity127 's oil and @entity128 met from february 2002 to april 2003 and agreed that @entity12 " should be opened to international oil companies as quickly as possible after the war			1
" @entity131 : @entity12 suffocates in cloak of sorrow the list of the group 's members was not made public , but @entity137 -- who was appointed @entity12 's oil minister by the @entity10 occupation government in september 2003 -- was part of the group , according to @entity142 , a journalist and author of " fuel on the @entity145 : @entity146 in @entity12			2
" @entity147 promptly set about trying to implement the group 's objectives			0
at the same time , representatives from @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity151 and @entity26 , among others , met with @entity29 's staff in january 2003 to discuss plans for @entity12 's postwar industry			2
for the next decade , former and current executives of western oil companies acted first as administrators of @entity12 's oil ministry and then as " advisers " to the @entity162 government			1
before the invasion , there were just two things standing in the way of @entity8 oil companies operating in @entity12 : @entity168 and the nation 's legal system			1
the invasion dealt handily with @entity168			0
to address the latter problem , some both inside and outside of the @entity31 administration argued that it should simply change @entity12 's oil laws through the @entity10 - led coalition government of @entity12 , which ran the country from april 2003 to june 2004			1
instead the @entity178 waited , choosing to pressure the newly elected @entity162 government to pass new oil legislation itself			1
did @entity12 give birth to the @entity182 ? this @entity183 , partially drafted by the @entity8 oil industry , would lock the nation into private foreign investment under the most corporate - friendly terms			1
the @entity31 administration pushed the @entity162 government both publicly and privately to pass the law			1
and in january 2007 , as the '' surge " of 20,000 additional @entity10 troops was being finalized , the president set specific benchmarks for the @entity162 government , including the passage of new oil legislation to " promote investment , national unity , and reconciliation			1
" but due to enormous public opposition and a recalcitrant parliament , the central @entity162 government has failed to pass the @entity183			1
@entity202 , a member of the parliamentary energy committee , even quit in protest over the law , saying it would cede too much control to global companies and " ruin the country 's future			0
" in 2008 , with the likelihood of the law 's passage and the prospect of continued foreign military occupation dimming as elections loomed in the @entity10 and @entity12 , the oil companies settled on a different track			1
bypassing parliament , the firms started signing contracts that provide all of the access and most of the favorable treatment the @entity183 would provide -- and the @entity31 administration helped draft the model contracts			2
why women are less free after @entity0 upon leaving office , @entity31 and @entity228 administration officials have even worked for oil companies as advisers on their @entity12 endeavors			1
for example , former @entity10 ambassador to @entity12 @entity240 's company , @entity241 - @entity239 , " provides international oil companies and multinationals with unparalleled access , insight and knowledge on @entity12			2
" the new contracts lack the security a new legal structure would grant , and @entity162 lawmakers have argued that they run contrary to existing law , which requires government control , operation and ownership of @entity12 's oil sector			1
but the contracts do achieve the key goal of the @entity97 : all but privatizing the @entity162 oil sector and opening it to private foreign companies			1
they also provide exceptionally long contract terms and high ownership stakes and eliminate requirements that @entity12 's oil stay in @entity12 , that companies invest earnings in the local economy or hire a majority of local workers			0
@entity12 's oil production has increased by more than 40 % in the past five years to 3 million barrels of oil a day ( still below the 1979 high of 3.5 million set by @entity12 's state - owned companies ) , but a full 80 % of this is being exported out of the country while @entity162 struggle to meet basic energy consumption needs			1
gdp per capita has increased significantly yet remains among the lowest in the world and well below some of @entity12 's other oil - rich neighbors			0
basic services such as water and electricity remain luxuries , while 25 % of the population lives in poverty			0
share your story of the @entity0 the promise of new energy - related jobs across the country has yet to materialize			0
the oil and gas sectors today account directly for less than 2 % of total employment , as foreign companies rely instead on imported labor			0
in just the last few weeks , more than 1,000 people have protested at @entity19 and @entity299 @entity298 's super-giant @entity296 oil field , demanding jobs and payment for private land that has been lost or damaged by oil operations			0
the @entity162 military was called in to respond			0
@entity51 up with the firms , a leading coalition of @entity162 civil society groups and trade unions , including oil workers , declared on february 15 that international oil companies have " taken the place of foreign troops in compromising @entity162 sovereignty " and should " set a timetable for withdrawal			1
" closer to home , at a protest at @entity20 's @entity321 headquarters in 2010 , former @entity316 officer @entity315 , member of @entity317 , held up a sign that read , " dear @entity20 : thank you for dishonoring our service " ( @entity114 )			0
yes , the @entity0 was a war for oil , and it was a war with losers : the @entity162 people and all those who spilled and lost blood so that @entity3 could come out ahead .			2

@entity331 : opening up @entity12 to foreign oil companies was main goal of @entity0
plans for @entity8 oil exploration in @entity12 were drawn up years before 2003 invasion
@entity31 administration pressured @entity162 government to pass law allowing foreign firms in
@entity59 in 2007 : " people say we 're not fighting for oil . of course we are . "
