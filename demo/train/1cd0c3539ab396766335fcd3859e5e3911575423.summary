editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of history and public affairs at @entity6 's @entity5			1
he is completing a book on the history of national security politics since @entity10 , to be published by @entity11			0
@entity2 writes widely on current events			1
@entity14 says it 's not enough for @entity16 to oppose @entity18 's plans , they must offer their own ideas			1
@entity20 , @entity21 ( @entity22 ) -- one of the best @entity24 movies , " @entity25 , " played in movie theaters at the height of the @entity28 in 1932			0
in the film , the comedian @entity29 played the new president of @entity32 , @entity25			0
during one of the most memorable scenes , @entity29 introduces himself to faculty and students by singing about his philosophy of governance : " your proposition may be good / but let 's have one thing understood / whatever it is , i 'm against it ! / and even when you 've changed it or condensed it , i 'm against it / i 'm opposed to it / on general principle			0
i 'm opposed to it			0
" if @entity16 want to rebuild their party after the calamity of 2008 , the party leadership needs to avoid the @entity25 approach to politics			1
when @entity18 proposed his economic recovery bill last week , the first words to come out of @entity58 's @entity57 's mouth sounded a bit like @entity61			0
with the economy imploding and the international economic crisis worsening , @entity57 said : " right now , given the concerns that we have over the size of the package and all of the spending in this package , we do n't think it 's going to work			2
and so if it 's the plan that i see today , put me down in the ' no ' column			2
" senate minority leader @entity74 has been more restrained in his response , leaving open the door to compromise			0
if @entity57 is simply acting as dr. no to get a better deal , @entity16 can come out of the negotiations over the economic recovery bill as partners , planting the seeds for a new @entity16 approach toward dealing with economic matters			1
but if @entity57 's plan is for his party to act as an oppositional force -- trying to block , delay and prevent legislative action -- then the @entity16 could find itself in big trouble			1
if the @entity16 do n't agree with @entity18 's approach , given the severity of the crisis , they need to offer an alternative rather than just sitting still			1
to be sure , there is the possibility that if the economy continues to deteriorate after a bill has passed and the public loses faith in @entity18 , the @entity97 @entity16 could reap the benefit from their opposition			1
they could say " we told you so			0
" but even that would be a high - risk maneuver , particularly given the state of public opinion about the @entity16			1
even if a bill passes and the economy continues to struggle , voters would be looking at a @entity16 that did n't have anything better to offer			1
the public likes hard - working politicians			0
president @entity119 's @entity118 ideas did n't always work -- some like the @entity121 were downright failures -- but voters valued a president who tried to offer arguments about how to end the crisis and who rolled up his sleeves to make the nation better			0
the election of 2008 revealed that the @entity16 lacks the kind of big ideas that @entity133 used in 1980 to bring the conservative movement into power			1
the various factions of the conservative movement came together around the themes of anti-communism , deregulation and tax cuts			0
@entity133 did n't just sell tax cuts for the wealthy as good in themselves , but connected them to supply - side economics , which claimed that cuts would stimulate investment , generate economic growth and ultimately bring more revenue into the coffers of @entity151			0
even after the @entity153 collapsed , @entity16 leaders found ideas to sell their movement to the public			1
@entity157 and a cohort of young @entity16 focused on sharp attacks about the dangers of government intervention and corruption of government			2
for a short time it seemed that under @entity168 , the war on terrorism would provide a new thematic focus to @entity16 efforts			2
but this was not to be			0
the controversies over @entity173 and the continued dangers in countries such as @entity176 undermined @entity16 claims of superiority on national security policy			2
controversies over the erosion of civil liberties and due process in the pursuit of terrorism also weakened their claims			0
when the economy collapsed in fall 2008 , @entity16 ' arguments about the wisdom of tax cuts and deregulation were made suspect			1
@entity193 might not always like government , but they dislike being broke even more			0
sen. @entity195 struggled in his campaign , not just because of the weaknesses of his campaign , but because his party seemed to lack any answers as @entity201 and @entity202 spun out of control			0
furthermore , the fact that the federal government continued to expand under @entity168 -- both when @entity16 and @entity206 controlled @entity207 -- made it difficult to sell @entity16 arguments about the dangers of big government			1
back in the 1970s , when @entity16 felt as if they were in the political wilderness , they invested a great deal of their resources into the market of ideas			2
conservatives built think tanks like the @entity219 , established talk radio shows , and financed academic scholarship about conservatism so that when opportunities arose in the elections of 1980 and 1994 , @entity16 had something to say			2
at some point , @entity16 have to tap into the 1970s enthusiasm about generating ideas if they want to rebuild their party and win over the hearts and minds of voters			2
simply reviving the philosophy of the 1970s wo n't work			0
rather the @entity16 needs to offer new arguments and new policies to achieve economic recovery			1
if they repeat what happened in the 1930s , when @entity16 sounded a lot like @entity29 and just said no as @entity119 rebuilt the nation , they are likely to remain on the outskirts of power for decades to come			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity14 .			2

@entity14 : @entity97 @entity16 are signaling they will oppose stimulus plan
he says *republicans* are in trouble if they simply act as an opposition force
@entity206 gained sway for decades by seeking to improve the economy , he says
@entity2 : if @entity16 opposes stimulus plan , it should offer alternatives of its own
