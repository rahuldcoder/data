-- @entity2 's prime minister repeated saturday that he has a " high degree of confidence " that acoustic signals detected in the @entity6 are from at least one of the two black boxes from the missing @entity9 plane , but predicted that finding them remains a " massive , massive task			1
" " it is likely to continue for a long time to come , " @entity12 told journalists in @entity14 , where he was on a diplomatic visit			1
@entity18 officials appreciate @entity2 's " transparency and candor " in the search for @entity22 , he said , adding " i think it 's to our country 's credit that we 've approached it that way			1
" more than 35 days since the plane vanished from radar screens early march 8 during a flight from @entity31 , @entity9 , to @entity14 , the search continued			1
up to 11 military aircraft , one civil aircraft and 14 ships will assist in sunday 's search for the missing airliner , the @entity2 's @entity32 said			1
the @entity38 planned a visual search area totaling approximately 22,203 square miles ( 57,506 square kilometers )			1
the center of the search area lies about 1,367 miles ( 2,200 kilometers ) northwest of @entity42			1
during friday 's search , only a small number of the objects sighted from aircraft and ships were recovered ; as has been the case throughout the effort , none was linked to the @entity52 aircraft , according to the @entity32			1
still , the @entity54 commander leading the @entity56 effort to find @entity22 said he was " optimistic " about how the search is proceeding			1
the four pings detected in recent days were continuous and consistent with what a black box would emit , said @entity61			0
" we 've ruled out that it was anything natural , or anything from commercial shipping , or anything like that			0
" " i agree with the prime minister , " @entity62 said			0
" families skeptical but the optimism was not universal			0
relatives of the 239 people who were aboard the plane when it vanished met friday with @entity77 and government officials			0
the mother of @entity80 , the 19 - year - old @entity81 man who used a fake passport to board the plane , came away unimpressed			1
" i feel the @entity9 government has forgotten about all things @entity22 , " his mother told @entity0 on saturday			2
" these days there is not news			0
they only keep saying , ' we are searching			2
' " on saturday , searchers aboard the @entity2 vessel @entity91 were planning to continue towing the ping locator -- referred to as a @entity93 -- at a walking pace through the water in hopes of picking up new signals from either or both of the locator signals that were attached to the plane 's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder , @entity62 said			2
the more signals they can locate , the more investigators say they can narrow the search zone			2
" we have to stick with the @entity93 for just a little while longer to make sure we have exhausted every ounce of power coming from the battery through the black boxes , " he said			0
the batteries were certified to last 30 days , but the beacon manufacturer predicted they would last days longer			0
once the searchers have concluded that there is no hope that the batteries could still be powering the beacons , searchers will lower into the water the @entity121 - 21 , a sonar device , to scour the ocean floor			0
the @entity121 's pace is slower than that of the @entity93 , he said			2
four pings , one dud on april 5 , the @entity93 detected two sets of underwater pulses of a frequency close to that used by the locator beacons			0
three days later , last tuesday , it reacquired the signals twice			0
all four signals were within 17 miles of one another			0
a fifth ping , detected thursday by a sonobuoy dropped from an airplane , is " unlikely to be related to the aircraft black boxes , " @entity2 chief search coordinator @entity137 said a day later			1
tracking pings is only one early step in the hunt to find the plane 's data recorders , wreckage and the people aboard			2
imagining the search underwater as the focus narrows , more questions surface in search for @entity9 370 the hunt for a flight 370 ping : how they are doing it how deep is deep ? imagining the @entity22 search underwater @entity0 's @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 and journalists @entity161 and @entity163 contributed to this report .			1

a mother 's *lament* : " they only keep saying , ' we are searching ' "
@entity12 predicts a long slog
" we 're optimistic , " @entity54 commander says
