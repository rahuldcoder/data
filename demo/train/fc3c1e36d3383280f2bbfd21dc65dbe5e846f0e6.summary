an elephant leg as a trash can			2
a crocodile skin for a bathroom carpet			2
a bear skin to help a man project power in the bedroom			2
these are just some of the objects confiscated by @entity11 customs officers and documented by @entity12 , a photographer and filmmaker at @entity14			1
for @entity12 , the illegal wildlife trade symbolizes the devastation that can result from human thoughtlessness , " which , like locusts , can destroy all we have around us			1
" @entity12 first learned about the illicit trade when he was a teenager in the 1990s			1
he was shocked by the stories he heard			2
but it was seeing an exhibit of trafficked animal goods -- items seized by customs officials at an airport in @entity28 , @entity11 -- that prompted him to embark on his photographic project " @entity31			1
" " i am not an idealist , but in our world we have the belief that we are the only valuable existence on @entity37 -- and this is not acceptable , " @entity12 said			1
" the relation of men towards animals and nature is a reflection of the characteristics of the whole human population , as we still allow crimes against animals and nature			2
we do not understand that respecting the planet translates into respect of the people for themselves			1
" let us keep balance and let us use only what we need to live by			2
cutting off the leg of an elephant and using it as a trash can is a testament to our hypocrisy			2
" @entity12 's pictures were mostly taken over a two - week period , although he anticipates taking more in the future			1
some of the specimens shown were confiscated years ago at the @entity28 airport , which placed its exhibit in the middle of the departures terminal to raise awareness of the problem			1
@entity12 's images are not a story about a particular airport , he said , but they reflect a wider issue			1
" through these photographs , i will try to sensitize people and make them aware that they are often part of the problem , " he said			1
" this project aims to show human arrogance and folly and to build in us humility			2
" in my work i often use the sense of peace and tranquility in the photographs			0
hence the idea of a black background -- i wanted to isolate these exhibits to give them the rank of authenticity and pain			0
" i wanted to pass on , as well , how uncomfortable i felt when i had to touch and set up these exhibits to be photographed or listen to horror stories of the customs officers			0
" one story that stood out in particular for @entity12 was that of a rapid decline in a seahorse species surrounding @entity99			1
" this decline came suddenly , out of nowhere , " he recounted			0
" a short time afterwards , the @entity11 customs officers intercepted a cargo of dried seahorses			1
it turned out that some @entity99 company exported them to @entity11 as dietary supplements , a total of 27 tons of seahorses			1
" how many seahorses had to die to produce 27 tons of powder ? millions			0
that almost threatened the extinction of the entire population , perhaps even more than one species			0
" it shows how easy it is to cause irreparable damage to nature and how stupid we are			0
" @entity11 customs officers have done well in combating the trade , @entity12 said			1
they no longer find cardboard boxes filled with hundreds of turtles , or parrot cages containing tied - up birds , or containers of snakes and lizards that are stuffed so full that only half survived the trip , he said			0
now , smuggling efforts are more likely to involve someone trying to transport a baby monkey or pass off a serval -- an @entity137 wild cat -- as a domestic cat , he said			0
social media follow @ @entity140 on @entity141 to join the conversation about photography			0
" at first glance , it seems therefore that it is better			0
but it is not , " @entity12 said			1
" this illegal trade is running as before , even faster , only ever more discreetly			1
" before , this trade flourished in markets and pet stores , while today traders often use the @entity152			0
it is not only convenient , but also safer			0
the merchant offers for sale one or two pieces , sends them by courier , and if there is a setback , the loss is small			0
" the criminal responsibility is smaller too , because it deals with smuggling a single specimen			0
illegal transactions favor the @entity152			2
a global network does not recognize borders			0
" today , @entity12 said , anyone with an internet connection can visit the traffickers ' websites			1
" the only limitation is language , " he said			0
" one who knows languages can buy everything			0
" @entity12 is a @entity11 photographer			1
you can follow him on @entity141 and @entity177 .			0
