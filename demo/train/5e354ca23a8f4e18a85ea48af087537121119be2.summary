-- a new digital map helps you find the @entity3 among us			2
@entity5 made a shocking confession , @entity7 and @entity8 advanced the world of wearable tech with souped - up gloves and you 'll never have to take another lonely selfie , thanks to @entity15			1
it must be @entity17 on the @entity18			1
in what 's become an annual tradition , the tech world embraced the tomfoolery of april 1 with all the gusto you 'd expect from clever geeks with time on their hands between hackathons			1
and the results this year were solid			2
as usual , @entity29 led the cheeky charge with a spate of gags spanning its many web and mobile services			1
first came the rollout of @entity36 , which turns the @entity37 and @entity39 versions of @entity40 into a big version of the classic " catch ' em all " video and card games			2
according to the gag -- or are they serious ? it 's so hard to tell today -- applicants who find all 25 @entity3 hidden around the world will be considered job finalists by @entity29 and given the job title " @entity54			1
" " it 's always been important to us to have the most qualified employees at @entity29 , " @entity55 , the company 's vice president in charge of maps , says in a video			1
" now , using the technology created by the @entity40 team , we 've prepared the most rigorous test known to man to find the world 's best @entity54			1
" to play , users just need to open the newest version of @entity40 on their phone , tap the search bar and press start			0
the @entity40 accounts on @entity72 , @entity73 or @entity74 will be providing hints and tips			0
@entity72 announced @entity77 bombs with @entity15 , a tool by which everyone 's favorite knight - riding , lifeguarding @entity82 crooner may magically appear in photos they upload to the site			1
@entity88 will now work with @entity89 , the @entity87 team announced , letting web users who cling to those old - fashioned things called " words " know what these cheerfully annoying little icons mean			0
( @entity95 : a pair of clapping hands means " yay ! " ) " if somebody were able to just explicitly say , ' hey , i 'm flirting with you ' or ' hey , i 'm mocking you , ' that would just make my life a lot more efficient , " joked @entity98 , head of market research for @entity100 , in a @entity5 video			0
and speaking of @entity29 - owned @entity5 , the site made a big @entity109 's confession : all those viral videos ? fakes			1
" since 2005 , @entity5 's staff has worked tirelessly behind the scenes , meticulously crafting the viral videos and internet memes you 've come to know and love , " the announcement reads			1
" from mainstream hits like @entity125 and @entity126 to your obscure web forum favorites , our staff of writers , producers and directors has shaped the pop culture moments that matter in our digital lives			0
" the announcement , in a @entity5 video , naturally , lifts the lid on the videos that " we " will make popular in the coming year			0
among them : clocking , an only slightly more ridiculous cousin to planking , @entity137 , i.e. @entity5 users " hilariously ruining their bread when they try to spread cold butter on it , " and @entity144			0
but @entity29 were n't the only ones putting us on			1
the gadgety folks at @entity147 rolled out a host of gag items , from a car charger powered by the flux capacitor from " @entity160 " to a tie that fires lasers to mr. @entity154 , a machine that will help you grow " @entity159 " - level facial hair in mere moments			1
wearable tech is the big thing in the mobile world right now , and two big tech players advanced the game by moving mobile to your hands			2
@entity7 unveiled @entity169 , which includes a flexible led screen on your palm , a 16 - megapixel camera on your finger and 5g connectivity			1
meanwhile , @entity8 countered with the @entity176 , which straps the new @entity8 @entity177 to your forearm and provides the ability to " like " things on @entity73 by giving an actual thumbs - up with your hand			1
@entity184 announced that it 's expanding into the professional world with @entity186 , which lets you rent desk space from fellow office workers around the world who may have just popped out for a cup of coffee or bathroom break			2
@entity194 , the gadget - repair service , annouced they had been bought by @entity196			0
" as part of the deal , @entity196 made a commitment to produce the most replaceable electronic devices and personal computers on the market , " they said			0
" device is more than a year old ? @entity205			0
visit any of our @entity207 locations and an army of well - groomed young people will happily take your money and congratulate your excellent taste			0
" and @entity214 , the @entity215 scientific - research organization credited with helping to launch the @entity216 , announced that all its communications will be displayed from now on in the ( much - mocked ) font @entity218			2
so , let us remind you that everything you read on the @entity18 tuesday might not be true			0
in fact , that 's advice that should maybe be heeded the other 364 days of the year , too			2
those are n't nearly all of the gags floating around the web on tuesday			0
what are your favorites ? let us know in the comments .			0
