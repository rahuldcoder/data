@entity0 -- opposition leader @entity4 has not been named @entity6 's prime minister , but is " the logical choice , " the interim president 's spokesman said saturday , contradicting statements earlier in the day by officials in @entity4 's political party			1
the move comes as anger grows among supporters of deposed president @entity14 -- including the @entity15 -- who have decried the military 's move to push him from power , and raised fears of widening violence			1
@entity4 met with interim president @entity22 for two hours saturday afternoon , and " discussions and consultations are ongoing , " presidential adviser @entity21 said on state - run tv			1
" tomorrow we expect to name the prime minister and the ministers			1
" if @entity4 is selected , it would signal a secular shift just days after a military coup ousted the nation 's first democratically elected -- and @entity33 -- president			1
the country stands divided between those who support the return to power of @entity14 and those who applaud the military takeover and accuse @entity14 's government of having edged toward an @entity33 and autocratic rule			1
each side accuses the other of thwarting democracy			1
and on saturday , each side was trying to present a unified front , as violence between @entity14 's supporters and his opponents and the military swept across the country , leaving at least 30 dead and more than 1,400 wounded , according to state - run media			2
the possible appointment of @entity4 , the defacto head of the opposition movement in the days leading to wednesday 's ouster of @entity14 , has been discussed as a possibility among supporters in recent days			1
@entity4 , the former head of the @entity60 's nuclear watchdog agency , ran in the country 's first election in 2012 but withdrew after criticizing the interim government for failing to bring about a " real democratic system			1
" how @entity14 's supporters , who supported the deposed @entity33 president 's rule , react to the new government will be key for post-coup @entity6 , where the military suspended the country 's constitution and dissolved parliament			1
@entity4 : @entity14 's ouster was needed so @entity6 can not ' fail ' in an interview with @entity1 on thursday , @entity4 called @entity14 's ouster a " reset " of the 2011 popular revolution that toppled @entity78			1
" either we risk a civil war or ... take extra constitutional measures to ensure that we keep the country together , " he said , explaining the military 's conundrum			2
" this is a recall , and it is nothing novel			2

and pro-morsy demonstrations continued around the @entity96			2
the @entity99 , responding to " rumors and lies , " said on its @entity101 page that there was no division among its ranks over its decision to back " the demands of the @entity6 people " over the government			2
" these rumors are completely and utterly untrue , " it said			2

crowds of @entity14 supporters converged for a second consecutive day saturday outside the @entity89 complex , where @entity14 was reportedly being held , according to a tweet from the party			2
" @entity144 , @entity144 , president , " the crowds were said to be chanting			1

" either we risk a civil war or ... take extra constitutional measures to ensure that we keep the country together , " he said , explaining the military 's conundrum			0
" this is a recall , and it is nothing novel			0
" but @entity14 failed to fix the nation 's ailing economy or stop spiraling crime , both of which worsened during his tenure			0
he was seen by many as increasingly autocratic			0

" we can not repeat the same mistakes that we made at other times in our history by supporting the removal of freely elected governments , " the ranking member of the @entity287 told @entity1 affiliate @entity288			0
