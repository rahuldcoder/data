as the political situation in @entity2 worsens with deaths on @entity5 's streets this week , @entity0 takes a look at the root causes of the protests , and what the latest developments might mean for the country 's political future			1
who is protesting and why ? unlike the 2010 protests , which saw red - shirted supporters of ousted prime minister @entity16 turn out in force , this time around it is opponents of his younger sister @entity20 's government who are protesting in the capital			1
as with previous protests , the country is largely divided between a younger , educated urban middle - class and a conservative class of poor rural voters , largely from the north of the country			2
it is the former group who have taken to the streets and are currently battling the police after months of deepening political division			2
the protestors , led by @entity37 -- a deputy prime minister in the previous @entity40 - led government -- rejected @entity20 's poll in early february and are calling for the creation of an unelected " people 's council " headed by a premier appointed by @entity2 's king			1
what triggered the current crisis ? @entity20 's prime ministership was largely stable until her party attempted to pass a controversial amnesty bill in november			1
the bill would have nullified former prime minister @entity16 's corruption conviction and would have allowed him to return to the country			0
the policeman - turned - tycoon has been living in exile in a number of different locations , most recently @entity60 , since he was removed in a bloodless coup in 2006			0
he briefly returned to @entity2 in 2008			0
later that year , he was convicted by a @entity2 court of corruption and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison over a controversial land deal			0
courts have also frozen billions of dollars of his assets , but he is believed to still have a great deal of money held elsewhere			0
what is @entity16 's role in the current crisis ? while he technically plays no part in the current political situation , the deeply - divisive @entity16 is never far from the heart of @entity2 politics , communicating with supporters via social media and video messages			0
with his younger sister in power since 2011 , his influence remains strong			0
critics say @entity20 is @entity16 's proxy but she insists she has always been independent			1
the current protests were sparked by attempts by her government to enact the amnesty law that opponents said was designed to protect him and others , facilitating his return to the country -- and ultimately , to an active role in @entity2 politics			0
why are @entity2 protests in the news so often ? the country has had a restive history since the dissolution of its absolute monarchy in 1932			0
there have been a dozen military coups d'etat over the years , most notably in 1947 , and again in the 1970s , which led to the creation of a new constitution			1
the most recent military coup was in 2006 , which led to the ouster of @entity16			1
civilian rule was restored with a @entity16 - linked civilian government in charge but protests in 2008 -- including the blockade of the capital 's airports -- eventually led to the creation of a coalition government			2
2009 - 10 saw @entity120 supporters , known as the red shirts , take to the streets and demand fresh elections , eventually leading to @entity20 's election -- which brings us to the current situation			1
what impact did the february 2 election have ? under pressure , @entity20 dissolved parliament and called for new elections at the beginning of february			1
these were disrupted by protestors , particularly in the capital and in the south of the country			0
ahead of the elections , @entity37 -- the leader of the protests -- urged his supporters to boycott the poll and recently petitioned the @entity142 to annul the election			2
they were not successful and while the results are still in doubt , the country is being ruled by an interim government headed by @entity20 , but one that lacks absolute authority			1
what role is the @entity2 king playing in all this ? despite the turbulent nature of @entity2 's democratic political scene the country is home to the world 's longest - serving monarch			0
@entity159 , aged 86 , is universally revered in @entity2 but prefers to remain ostensibly neutral in matters of government , although he called for national unity in his birthday speech in december			0
what caused the latest flare - up ? after a period of relative calm -- and a feeling that appetite for the protests was dying down -- trouble has flared up again this week as police in the capital tried to reclaim official government sites occupied by protestors			0
reacting to the attempted eviction , around 6,000 demonstrators were estimated to be on the streets of the city tuesday			2
an outbreak of violence that day saw five people -- including at least two protestors and a police office -- killed in central @entity5			1
following police action in which tear gas was fired in an attempt to disperse crowds of demonstrators in the streets , people among the protesters began firing guns at police , who responded with both rubber bullets and live fire			0
15,000 police are said to have been mobilized in the latest operations			0
seventy - three people -- both police officers and opposition supporters -- have been wounded in recent clashes			2
will the military step in ? up until now the military has resisted calls from the protestors to intervene on their behalf , and it seems that its current leadership lacks the appetite for regime change			2
however , the country 's army chief , general @entity213 , has not ruled out the possibility that the military will intervene if violence on the streets of @entity5 worsens			1
what 's the story with the rice - pledging scheme ? the political crisis took on a new twist when a subsidy program that benefited rice farmers -- part of @entity20 's base -- was decried as corrupt by opposition leaders			1
the scheme was a centerpiece of @entity20 's election platform and has been beset with payment problems			1
@entity20 criticized her opponents for politicizing the issue , but this week the country 's @entity235 ( @entity235 ) announced their decision to charge her with " dereliction of duty , " which could have serious implications for her retention of the premiership			1
she is expected to answer the charge on february 27 , according to the @entity243			2
is @entity2 safe ? in the run - up to the elections several countries issued travel advisories for tourists and in the wake of this week 's fatalities it is likely that these precautions will be used more frequently			0
reports of office closures in @entity5 on tuesday and wednesday have been received by @entity0 as the situation on the ground escalates .			1

*disputed* election at beginning of february did little to pacify opposition
