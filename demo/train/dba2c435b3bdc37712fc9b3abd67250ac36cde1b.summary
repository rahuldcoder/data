-- cold water and nude beaches do n't necessarily mix well			1
add to the equation a very conservative society and the idea of a nude beach seems rather ambitious , if not impossible			1
in a surprisingly creative tourism push , officials in north east @entity8 are aiming to set up @entity11 's first nude beach , with the first clothes to be shed in 2017			1
it 's an effort to boost tourism to the peninsula 's east coast beaches , which lose out every year to the west coast in luring summer visitors from the capital @entity20			1
although the east coast has more beautiful , sandy beaches , the water tends to be colder , the season shorter and the distance from @entity20 is greater than the beaches to the west			2
the massively popular annual mud festival is also held on the west coast			0
skinny dip - friendly " this is part of our plans to create beaches with specific purpose , like a beach for families , a beach for couples , a beach for pets , and yes , a nude beach , " said an official from the municipality 's @entity31 at a seminar on tuesday , according to the @entity34			1
calls by @entity0 to officials were not answered on thursday			2
somewhat surprisingly , this is not the first time the subject has been broached by government officials			2
and in the past it 's the public that 's shuttered the idea			0
@entity8 tried to launch a female - only nude beach in 2005 , while @entity57 also deliberated , but ultimately scrapped , a nude beach idea due to public outcry			1
the same happened to a @entity61 proposal in 2009			0
which beach ? officials have not yet decided which beach may be the first to go nude			1
they are also deliberating over a trial operation for foreigners only			2
the premise is foreigners will be much more comfortable with the concept than locals			0
" @entity72 actually love nude beaches when they 're traveling abroad , but the problem with having one within @entity11 is the fact that @entity11 society is so interconnected , " @entity20 - based travel reporter @entity71 - woo told @entity0			1
" they wo n't be able to comfortably go to a nude beach due to the thought that people they know will find out about it quite easily			2
" that threat is reinforced given the country 's has second - highest smartphone penetration rate in the world ( 73 % , just behind @entity87 ' 73.8 % ) and a staggering 82.7 % internet penetration rate			0
early reaction to the concept was skeptical			0
twitter user @ amudoan : " doubtful that people will actually go			0
and even if they do , it 'll be 99.99 % guys			0
" @ @entity96 tweeted " why do n't they just call it a men 's sauna ? " ( both comments translated here into @entity101 ) .			0

@entity8 eyes clothes - free *options* in attempt to *attract* tourists
plans for nude beaches in @entity11 have been *discussed* since 2005
