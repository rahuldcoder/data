@entity0 -- @entity2 , who made the @entity4 - winning movie " the @entity5 " on the @entity7 war , is in the preliminary stages of making a movie about the killing of @entity11 and has gotten access to top @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity16 officials about the raid			1
that has rep. @entity19 , the @entity20 chairman of the @entity21 , demanding investigations by the @entity14 and @entity16 inspectors general into what , if any , classified information about special operations tactics , techniques and procedures were leaked to filmmakers			1
on wednesday , the @entity13 called @entity19 's claims " ridiculous			1
" " when people , including you in this room , are working on articles , books , documentaries or movies that involve the president ask to speak to administration officials , we do our best to accommodate them to make sure the facts are correct , " press secretary @entity31 told reporters			0
" we do not discuss classified information , and i would hope as we face a continued threat from terrorism , the @entity21 would have more important topics to discuss than a movie			1
" @entity31 said the filmmakers have met with @entity13 officials and that " the information that this @entity13 has provided about that mission has been focused on the president 's role			1
" " there is no difference in the information that we have given to anybody that is working on this topic from what we gave to those of you in this room who worked on it in the days and weeks after the raid itself , " @entity31 said			0
" someone wrote out a statement for @entity31 and he has no idea what he talking about , " @entity19 told @entity1 in an interview			0
@entity71 , the @entity14 's director of entertainment media , said he had had one meeting with @entity2 and her team about her movie since @entity11 was killed			2
that was a preliminary discussion involving @entity71 , the filmmakers and @entity78 , the undersecretary of defense for intelligence , that mostly involved the decision - making process in the @entity14 regarding the raid			2
" we go to great lengths not to reveal classified information , " said @entity71 , whose main duty is as a liaison with @entity86			1
@entity14 spokesman col. @entity89 said @entity2 's team did have other meetings at the @entity14 that did not involve @entity71 , but they were ordinary script research meetings that the @entity14 provides to established filmmakers on a regular basis			2
one of the issues that @entity19 , @entity97 - @entity96 , expressed concern about is that the movie would be released in october 2012 , just before president @entity100 , who gave the order to raid @entity11 's compound , will stand for re-election			2
the timing of the release three weeks before the election " puts a cloud over the whole project " and is " a breach of faith " with the military and intelligence community , @entity19 said			1
in a statement issued wednesday , filmmakers @entity2 and @entity114 denied any political motivation in a project that began years ago			0
" our upcoming film project about the decade - long pursuit of @entity11 has been in the works for many years and integrates the collective efforts of three administrations , including those of presidents @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity100 , as well as the cooperative strategies and implementation by the @entity14 and the @entity16 , " the filmmakers said			1
" indeed , the dangerous work of finding the world 's most wanted man was carried out by individuals in the military and intelligence communities who put their lives at risk for the greater good without regard for political affiliation			0
this was an @entity143 triumph , both heroic and nonpartisan , and there is no basis to suggest that our film will represent this enormous victory otherwise , " the statement said			0
the @entity16 issued a statement about its role in helping moviemakers , saying such public outreach has gone on for years			0
" our goal is an accurate portrayal of the men and women of the @entity16 , their vital mission and the commitment to public service that defines them , " the @entity16 statement said			0
there was a @entity16 ceremony on june 29 in recognition of all those who assisted in the @entity11 raid , but the @entity16 would not say if any of the filmmakers were among the nearly 1,300 people in attendance .			0
