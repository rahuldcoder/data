-- @entity1 is the king we @entity2 just ca n't seem to make our minds up about			1
the monarch who reigned from 1483 to 1485 became , a century later , the blackest villain of @entity7 's history plays			0
the three most commonly known facts of his life are that he stole the crown , murdered his nephews and died wailing for a horse at the @entity14 in 1485			1
his death ushered in the @entity17 dynasty , so @entity1 often suffers the dual ignominy of being named the last " medieval " king of @entity20 -- in which medieval is not held to be a good thing			1
like any black legend , much of it is slander			0
@entity1 did indeed usurp the crown and lose at @entity14			1
he probably had his nephews killed , too ; it is unknowable but overwhelmingly likely			1
yet as his many supporters have been busy telling us since it was announced monday that @entity1 's lost skeleton was found in a car park in @entity34 , he was n't all bad			1
in fact , he was for most of his life loyal and conscientious			0
to fill you in , a news conference held at the @entity38 on monday confirmed what archaeologists working there have suspected for months : that a skeleton removed from under a parking lot in the city center last fall was indeed the long - lost remains of @entity1 news : @entity1 : is this the face that launched 1,000 myths ? his official burial place -- under the floor of a church belonging to the monastic order of the @entity54 -- had been lost during the dissolution of the monasteries that was carried out in the 1530s under @entity58 a legend grew up that the bones had been thrown in a river			1
today , we know they were not			0
what do the bones tell us ? well , they show that @entity1 -- identified by mitochondrial dna tests against a @entity68 descendant of his sister , @entity69 -- was about 5 - foot - 8 , suffered curvature of the spine and had delicate limbs			1
he had been buried roughly and unceremoniously in a shallow grave too small for him , beneath the choir of the church			0
he had died from a slicing blow to the back of the head sustained during battle and had suffered many other " humiliation injuries " after his death , including having a knife or dagger plunged into his hind parts			2
his hands may have been tied at his burial			0
opinion : what will the finding of @entity1 mean ? in other words , we have quite a lot of either new or confirmed biographical information about @entity1			2
he was not a hunchback , but he was spindly and warped			0
he was buried where it was said he was buried			0
he very likely was , as one source had said , carried roughly across a horse 's back from the battlefield where he died to @entity34 , stripped naked and abused all the way			2
all this is known today thanks to a superb piece of historical teamwork			0
the interdisciplinary team at @entity34 that worked toward monday 's revelations deserves huge plaudits			0
from the desk - based research that pinpointed the spot to dig , to the digging itself , to the bone analysis , the dna work and the genealogy that identified @entity1 's descendants , all of it is worthy of the highest praise			1
hat - tips , too , to the @entity121 , as well as @entity34 's @entity122 , which pulled together to make the project happen and also to publicize the society and city so effectively			0
however , should anyone today tell you that @entity1 's skeleton somehow vindicates his historical reputation , you may tell them they are talking horsefeathers			1
news : back from the grave , @entity1 gets rehab @entity1 got a rep for a reason			1
he usurped the crown from a 12 - year old boy , who later died			2
this was his great crime , and there is no point denying it			0
it is true that before this crime , @entity1 was a conspicuously loyal lieutenant to the boy 's father , his own brother , @entity146 it is also true that once he was king , @entity1 made a great effort to promote justice to the poor and needy , stabilize royal finances and contain public disorder			1
but this does not mitigate that he stole the crown , justifying it after the fact with the claim that his nephews were illegitimate			2
likewise , it remains indisputably true that his usurpation threw @entity20 politics , painstakingly restored to some order in the 12 years before his crime , into a turmoil from which it did not fully recover for another two decades			0
so the discovery of @entity1 's bones is exciting			1
but it does not tell us anything to justify changing the current historical view of @entity1 : that the @entity17 historians and propagandists , culminating with @entity7 , may have exaggerated his physical deformities and the horrors of @entity1 's character , but he remains a criminal king whose actions wrought havoc on his realm			1
unfortunately , we do n't all want to hear that			0
@entity1 remains the only king with a society devoted to rehabilitating his name , and it is a trait of some " @entity121 " to refuse to acknowledge any criticism of their hero whatever			1
so despite today 's discovery , we @entity189 are likely to remain split on @entity1 down the old lines : murdering , crook - backed , dissembling @entity193 monster versus misunderstood , loyal , enlightened , slandered hero			2
which is the truth ? somewhere in between			0
that 's a classic historian 's answer , is n't it ? but it 's also the truth			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			0

@entity204 : @entity1 's remains found ; some see chance to redeem his bad reputation
@entity204 says the bones reveal and confirm his appearance , how he died and his injuries
nothing changes his rep as a usurper of the crown who likely had nephews killed , @entity204 says
@entity204 : @entity1 good or bad ? truth likely somewhere in between
