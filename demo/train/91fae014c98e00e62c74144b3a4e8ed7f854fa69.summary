however , officials from the co-hosts hit out at the program			0
@entity192 , a @entity7 @entity193 spokesman , told @entity98 it was " cheap journalism , " while @entity194 , @entity11 's ambassador to @entity195 , said it was " unbalanced and biased reporting about the situation in @entity11			1
" but @entity198 , executive director of the @entity200 organization , said there was still plenty of work to be done in both countries			0
" i think we know the situation in domestic football in both @entity7 and @entity11 and i 'm afraid the documentary hit the nail on the head -- it 's a very bad situation , " he said			1

" aside from allegations of racism , the choice of @entity7 and @entity11 as hosts of @entity30 's @entity128 international football competition -- an event which @entity30 says will see 1.4 million fans travel to the region and a further 150 million television viewers tune in worldwide -- has drawn criticism from lawmakers of many @entity231 nations , with some refusing to attend the tournament			1

" this is a mistake made by some politicians when they express their opinion without digging into the case			0
no one accuses @entity236 of her political decisions			0
@entity236 is accused of a concrete crime , " @entity245 said			0
" there was no government decision which she is referring to when she signed an unfavorable gas contract for @entity11			2
she falsified that government decision which means she committed the fraud			0
so it 's not a political decision			0
" the situation prompted the @entity263 to announce they would be effectively boycotting the event : " no ministers will be attending group games at @entity10			1
" we are keeping attendance at later stages of the tournament under review in the light of ministers ' busy schedules ahead of the @entity277 and widespread concerns about selective justice and the rule of law in @entity11 , " their statement read			1
foreign secretary @entity281 went further in an interview with the @entity173 , saying the @entity195 government did not want its backing of the @entity132 football team to be interpreted as " giving political support to some things which have been happening in @entity11 which we do n't agree with			1
