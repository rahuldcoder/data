with the annual post-thanksgiving multiplex malaise setting in and just one big new movie in theaters , the box office results remarkably resembled those of a week ago			0
@entity6 and @entity8 star in " @entity9 , " which stayed at no. 1			1
so , yep , you guessed it : four @entity9 was no. 1 with $ 18.2 million , according to sunday 's estimates			1
that brings the holiday comedy 's two - week sum to a sweet $ 70.8 million -- and it restores my confidence in @entity8 and @entity6 as box office draws			2
for now , at least			0
the rest of the top five is comprised of the same movies we 've been seeing for a while now			0
@entity25 moved back up to the no. 2 spot with a tidy $ 13.2 million haul ; its three - week sum is $ 138.6 million			1
@entity29 ( no. 3 ) followed with $ 9.7 million , a huge and surprising 64 percent decline from its impressive @entity32 weekend sum			1
@entity33 declined 53 percent to bank $ 7 million at no. 4			1
and @entity34 ( no. 5 ) grossed $ 6.6 million and crossed the $ 500 million mark worldwide			2
among major new releases , the biggest was hardly the baddest : punisher : @entity2 ( no. 8 ) grossed a mere $ 4 million in 2,508 theaters , a tally that 's way off from the $ 13.8 million that @entity39 premiered with in 2004			1
more punishment : the @entity44 franchise reboot failed to defeat even last week 's action disappointment , @entity45 which was no. 7 with $ 4.5 million			1
ouch ! meanwhile , the other sorta - substantial new movie , @entity47 ( no. 9 ) , fared a bit better , bringing in a decent $ 3.5 million in 686 locations			2
but the indie drama @entity50 failed to take any prize ( except , perhaps , that of @entity53 ) , grossing just $ 370,575 in 893 venues -- a redonkulously low average of $ 415 per theater			2
@entity57 , the only real news of note came in the ultra-limited - release sphere , where the buzzy drama @entity62 debuted with a tremendous $ 60,049 average in three theaters in @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			0
the @entity69 contender will roll out wider in the coming weeks			0
overall , the slow box office was actually up more than 6 percent from the same , even slower frame a year ago , when @entity72 produced disappointing returns			0
that makes this the fifth straight " up " weekend of the fall season , and all things considered , it should be enough to spread some holiday cheer in @entity77			0
