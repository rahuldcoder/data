-- @entity1 once labeled the conditions as " inhuman " and three - time defending men 's champion @entity3 suffered a dramatic meltdown in a quarterfinal match in 2009 so it 's with a degree of trepidation that the world 's elite go into the @entity11 with a heatwave forecast for @entity13			1
temperatures are predicted to reach a blistering 42 degrees celsius tuesday ( @entity15 ) and remain at that level until the weekend			1
while the opening grand slam of the season has an @entity20 -- in place since 1998 -- it is rarely invoked and players simply have to make do			1
@entity3 , who had to retire with heat exhaustion against @entity24 when defending his 2008 crown , has become renowned for his supreme fitness levels and claims to be ready for any challenge			1
" i am expecting to play in big heat			0
you always have to expect it because you ca n't really predict @entity13 's weather , it 's changing a lot , " @entity3 told gathered reporters on the eve of his title defense			1
" i remember the 2008 , 2009 and 2010 tournaments , there were several days i played in extreme heat			2
so i know how tough it is			0
" but it 's the same for myself and my opponent so you have to adjust to it , " he said			2
given a favorable draw , avoiding the likes of world number one @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 until at least the final , @entity3 is unlikely to be troubled by the weather or his first round opponent @entity53 of @entity54 on monday			1
after that the level of the opposition and the heat is expected to rise with @entity59 @entity58 looming large as his main threat			2
@entity58 extended @entity3 in a five - set fourth round clash last year which many considered the outstanding match of 2013			1
this time around they can not meet until the semifinals by which time forecasters are predicting a return to more manageable conditions			2
@entity1 , playing her first grand slam since @entity71 last year , remains wary of conditions after being reminded of her 2007 three - setter against @entity75 's @entity74 , after which she made her outburst			1
" i do n't think anyone can prepare themselves for that type of heat , " she told reporters			0
" when you try to put in that effort , that maximum effort to give as an athlete , it 's pretty difficult for a longer period of time			0
" @entity49 , himself back in action after a layoff for surgery , is also not relishing extreme temperatures despite preparing for the championships in @entity95			1
" the difference between 32 degrees or whatever in @entity95 and 40 , it 's a huge difference			1
" it feels very different on the court			0
the court gets so hot , the air is extremely hot as well , " said the @entity100			0
if he can get the better of conditions , it is likely that both @entity50 then @entity48 would stand in his path if he wants to repeat last year 's men 's final showdown with @entity3			1
defending champion @entity108 and top seed @entity109 are strongly favored to meet in the women 's final and both claim to be unperturbed about the rising temperature gauge			2
" i 've been here playing for , what , last eight years			0
it 's not a new thing to play in the heat			0
i actually enjoy that , " said @entity108			0
" i mean , not all the time probably , but it 's nice to get some sun. " @entity109 tweeted earlier this week to complain about then cold conditions in the @entity121 capital , but claims to be ready for whatever awaits			2
" i 've been training my whole life in the heat			0
i think i 'm pretty used to it			0
but obviously the heat in @entity13 is just completely different than any other heat , " said the @entity126			2
" but it 's okay			0
i 've just got to be ready to play under any circumstances			0
" for the record , the hottest @entity11 was in 2009 when the average daily temperature was @entity133 , with @entity3 the most high - profile victim .			1

high temperatures expected for @entity11 tennis championships
temperatures set to reach 42 degrees @entity133 in @entity13
tournament has an ' @entity20 ' *policy*
men 's champion @entity3 fell victim to conditions in 2009
