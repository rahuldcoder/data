-- president @entity1 has had a tough year			1
although he began in january well aware of the immense problems that second - term presidents have historically confronted , it still does n't seem that he was fully prepared for what was to come			0
the past 12 months have found the president struggling to protect his domestic policies from attack and to maintain control of the national agenda			2
@entity1 began the year enjoying the glow of his reelection against @entity13			1
the year ended with his approval ratings plummeting ; more and more @entity15 reported that they did n't trust @entity1			1
many of the main items on his agenda -- tax reform , gun control , immigration reform , and climate change -- are languishing			0
what factors made this year so difficult ? the toughest challenge that president @entity1 faced has been the continuing ruthless opposition he has encountered on @entity27			1
congressional republicans have maintained their aggressive stance toward the administration , using the legislative process to achieve their objectives			0
the most tangible example of this strategy has been their threat to not raise the debt ceiling to force the president into several weeks of confrontation over the budget			1
even as their own party approval ratings plummeted , @entity40 displayed a fierce determination to move forward with their strategy			1
part of the problem stems from the fact that @entity47 @entity40 play to their activist base , which will shape the primaries in their safe districts , rather than to independent voters			1
tea party republicans control enough of the @entity53 to force the speaker into their corner if he wants to keep his job			0
although @entity1 held his ground on the final outcome of the debt ceiling battle , the budget brinkmanship consumed a huge amount of valuable political time			1
if @entity64 passes the current budget deal , it will create a temporary pause in the budget wars , but the battles have already taken their toll republicans used other tactics as well			1
they stifled @entity1 's federal judicial nominations and executive appointments , until @entity74 became so frustrated that they changed the filibuster rules ( a true sign of desperation in the upper chamber ! )			1
@entity47 @entity40 refused to move forward with an immigration bill with bipartisan support sent to them from the @entity74 , and conducted many hearings about the president 's health care program trying to find scandal in a story about poor implementation			1
that brings us to @entity1 's second challenge in 2013 , one that did not come from his opponents but the failures of management and organization of his own administration			1
after his health care program had survived judicial and legislative challenge , all eyes turned to see what the @entity99 would look like when the government launched the federal online health care exchange on october 1			1
the results were not pretty			0
the website was filled with problems			0
the system kept crashing when people tried to sign on			0
it gradually became clear that the site was not even prepared to disseminate the information about who purchased insurance to the insurers			0
investigative stories soon revealed that high - level officials had been aware of these problems long before the web site went live , and failed to properly prepare			0
two months later the administration was able to get the system running relatively smoothly , as far as we now know			0
but the embarrassment of the first weeks had its cost on @entity15 's confidence in the program , as well as in the president			1
political scientist @entity126 has reminded us that @entity129 policymaker @entity128 , an iconic figure in the 1950s and 1960s , once said that @entity131 was 1 % inspiration and 99 % implementation			0
in a toxic political atmosphere , @entity1 caused huge problems for himself with the way that he handled the 99 % of the job			1
and @entity1 has continued to struggle in the politics of perception			1
this has been a weakness of this administration from the start of his first term			0
@entity1 is a politician who maintains an unending belief in rationality			1
he refuses to embrace the frenzied media environment where it is often difficult to tell fact from fiction			0
since taking office , @entity1 has continued to hold firm to the idea that over time voters will pay attention to the facts , and that the candidate with the best argument will win			1
sometimes , particularly on foreign policy , his outlook has proven to be correct			0
but on many other occasions he has seen how quickly the national conversation can shift as the president stood silent			2
when @entity1 persuaded @entity64 to pass an economic stimulus bill in 2009 , the administration did little to sell the program			1
even though it was a modest program , heavily weighted toward tax cuts rather than government spending , conservatives branded it as a failed big - spending program that did nothing for the economy			0
when @entity64 passed a health care program in 2010 that left the private insurance system fully intact and avoided anything looking like a national health insurance plan , the @entity47 stood still as @entity40 defined the bill as big government gone wild			1
it was especially important that the @entity47 respond aggressively this year before the rollout , but it did not			2
the public never got fully behind the law , let alone understood it			0
the president has also allowed small stories to shift public discussion			2
most recently , he delivered a major address on inequality in @entity15			2
the speech was meant to outline an agenda for the rest of his presidency and provide a framework for the policies that he would pursue			0
within a few days of the speech , however , many reporters had refocused on new pseudo-scandals , such as the revelation that @entity1 once lived with an uncle who was almost deported as a result of a drunken - driving arrest			2
administration officials might rightly complain that these kinds of stories have little to do with the underlying issues facing the nation , but they still reflect the kind of media environment all presidents face			0
from marketing their programs to fighting back against smaller scandals , the president 's team needs to do a much better job in the politics of information			0
in apparent recognition of this failing , the administration is adding @entity223 , @entity224 , and @entity225 to the @entity47 team			0
in the realm of national security , @entity1 also struggled in the face of the ongoing disclosures over the @entity232 surveillance program			2
major leaks have revealed the extensive spying that the @entity15 has undertaken within the @entity15 and overseas , revelations that have angered many of the president 's supporters who had believed he would do things differently than president @entity240			2
the one area where the president has experienced slightly more positive outcomes are in foreign policy			0
in confronting a series of crises -- including @entity248 's use of chemical weapons against rebels and @entity252 's nuclear buildup -- secretary of state @entity253 has put in place a series of temporary deals that aim to curb these threats			1
although the verdict is out on both of these , and each deal can backfire on the administration if they do n't work out , for the time being the @entity47 has calmed the storms			0
@entity1 's supporters should hope that the tough moments of the year turn into learning moments for the president , hardening him for the coming year and giving him a better roadmap about how to push for his agenda in the upcoming year			1
they might take some solace from president @entity270 , who enjoyed some of his most important accomplishments in his final years in office -- the signing of the @entity275 with the @entity276 -- as well as president @entity277 , whose approval ratings skyrocketed in his final years			0
the good news for the president is that there is time left to win back public support and build on his record for the history textbooks			2
he also can gain some optimism from the fact that he is facing a deeply divided @entity40 whose approval ratings are even worse than his			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity290 .			2

@entity290 : president @entity1 suffered many reverses in 2013
he says the glow of reelection faded fast , as @entity1 faced *relentless* opposition from @entity40 in @entity64
budget battles consumed valuable time , and the rollout of @entity99 was a major embarrassment , he says
@entity290 : *diplomatic* deals on @entity252 and @entity248 provided some progress , but they may not hold
