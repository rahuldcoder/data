" all the children feel so scared when they cut the electricity , " said @entity2 , who shares the tight space with others whose homes were hit by artillery			2
" they just keep holding their mothers			0
" for the more than 1.8 million people squeezed into a territory about twice the size of @entity18 , chaos has always infringed on the daily rhythms of life			1

" plant workers said the facility took fire for three days before tuesday 's strike			1
on sunday , they said , the plant 's administration building took a direct hit			2
the @entity110 has said that a deliberate strike on the plant would be a violation of humanitarian law			0
before the fighting , most of @entity0 's power actually came from @entity22 , but transmission lines on both sides of the border have been damaged by either @entity22 missiles or @entity123 rockets			1
repairs on the lines could take a week , but no agreement has been reached on when that work can begin			0
last month , one @entity22 politician called on the government to permanently cut electricity to @entity0 , especially since the @entity48 owe tens of millions of dollars in electric bills			1

she has not left her house in a week			0
there is enough food available to residents , @entity184 said , but safety was a bigger concern			2
" we only eat when we remember to eat , " she said			2

" her internet service was restored thursday , @entity184 said			0
in the darkness and isolation of war , she blogs about life			0

" to my surprise , my brother is still awake			0
he comes to wish me a ' good ' night before he goes to sleep			0
stuck to his ear is a small radio that bewitches his face as he tells me that 20 people from @entity210 family were collectively murdered in @entity211			0
" she never wants to see that small radio again			0
" it bears nothing but news of death and has the ability to bewitch the face of its holder ( often holding it like they 'd hold a cellphone ) to fuming with anger , torn with sadness , ridden with fear , and rarely , filled with hope , " she wrote			0
