@entity0 -- while house speaker @entity3 is n't overtly ruling out picking a fight with president @entity5 over a spending bill , he is laying out an alternative strategy to avoid a government shutdown			1
during a closed door meeting on wednesday with @entity10 , @entity3 tried to " gently hold members ' hands and walk them away from this , " said one @entity15 source who was in the room			1
the debate is about whether @entity15 should attach a measure to defund @entity19 to a must - pass spending bill			1
the government runs out of money on september 30 , the end of the fiscal year			0
gamesmanship intensifies ahead of congressional recess some conservatives are pushing hard for a confrontation with the @entity5 administration over the issue , but other @entity15 members warn it could backfire , and place blame squarely on @entity15 if the government shuts down			1
@entity3 and top @entity35 leaders mapped out a plan with their members on wednesday to spend the five - week august recess touting what they 've done to chip away at @entity19 so far and to emphasize the issue will be a major focus this fall			1
" we 've got a strategy , " @entity3 told @entity10 @entity15 at their last meeting before the summer break , according to another @entity15 source in the meeting , adding that the @entity15 effort over july to delay key provisions of @entity19 has " arguably been the most important moment in the three years since the law was signed			1
" a summary of the plan provided by two @entity15 sources describes following up on earlier votes to delay @entity19 with more votes -- " a series of well - placed targeted strikes that will ultimately dissolve the @entity19 coalition and topple the president 's train wreck of a law , " says the plan			2
opinion : explain @entity19 at last @entity3 promised his colleagues more of those votes though he did n't specifically comment on the push to strip @entity19 funding as part of any stopgap spending bill			1
but he urged members to stick together and said , " this strategy is achievable			0
and it 's our best shot at actually getting rid of @entity19			0
executing this strategy does n't mean we ca n't do other things on @entity19 as well			0
this is designed to be a strategy we can build on			0
" @entity10 @entity15 aides recognize that there will be increased pressure on @entity3 and other @entity15 leaders to force a standoff with the president at the end of september over funding for his signature health care law			2
several conservative senators popular with the @entity15 base - including @entity90 of @entity91 , @entity92 of @entity93 , and @entity94 of @entity95 -- and a bloc of about 71 @entity10 @entity15 are saying they will refuse to vote for a measure that funds the government if it continues to fund @entity19			2
there is little enthusiasm for that approach by other @entity15 senators			0
@entity104 @entity15 rep @entity103 acknowledged there is a division among congressional @entity15 on the strategy , but predicted many of his colleagues would ultimately decide that threatening a government shutdown was a bad course of action for the party			1
" when people really start to think about the consequences of shutting down the entire federal government and inconveniencing and harming , quite frankly , millions of @entity117 -- millions out of work , tens of millions denied services they need -- you change the debate from @entity19 to the government shutdown			1
that 's just not a good strategy , " @entity103 told reporters after the meeting			0
source : @entity5 was ' rude and dismissive ' in exchange with @entity129 among the party 's loyal supporters outside @entity133 there is still an intense focus on using every means necessary to stop the health care law from going into place			0
a coalition of 50 outside conservative groups including the @entity139 , the @entity140 , and @entity141 sent a letter to @entity3 and @entity10 majority leader @entity143 demanding they pass a bill to fund the government but not allow any money for @entity19			1
" the best and last chance for @entity10 to stand up and thwart this law before its new entitlements kick in is during the upcoming funding debate , and the @entity10 should live up to the moment and pass a bill funding the government but denying any funding for @entity19 , " the letter states			2
@entity139 announced wednesday it is organizing a series of town hall meetings in nine cities across the country to urge the public to pressure lawmakers to support the effort			0
while these groups ratchet up the pressure , several @entity15 aides say they do n't have a good answer for @entity15 members on what the next step would be			2
even if the @entity10 decided to combine an @entity19 defunding provision with a spending bill the @entity171 - led @entity170 wo n't pass it , so the question remains on what leverage if any @entity10 @entity15 would have			1
" they have no answer -- that 's telling , " one senior @entity15 aide told @entity1 , adding what @entity3 and others laid out is " a strategy that 's showing results -- getting @entity171 to vote for bills			2
" the skirmish inside the @entity15 is simmering now , but is sure to heat up as @entity139 and other groups press @entity3 and other leaders over the august recess			0
it will hit full boil when the @entity10 returns in september and is only scheduled to be in session nine days before government funding runs out at the end of the month			0
@entity192 : @entity5 trying to get upper hand in looming showdown but multiple @entity10 @entity15 aides say they are hopeful that they can move members to support a so - called " clean " short - term funding measure -- without any provisions on policy issues -- at a level negotiated in the 2011 budget agreement			1
@entity15 want that bill to come in at a funding level that takes into account the forced spending cuts put in place by the sequester , but @entity171 are saying they want the spending level to be higher , at the level without those cuts			0
@entity15 aides believe @entity171 could be open to signing on so that both sides can punt the debate over how to deal with those across the board spending cuts into the late fall when broader budget negotiations will take place around a vote to raise the nation 's debt limit			1
@entity3 's office is sending members home for the recess with talking points on the " strategy to end @entity19 " along with a @entity228 presentation			2
these describe the plan to hold more @entity19 votes designed to pick off @entity171 support for the law , step up oversight about the administration 's implementation of the law and ramp up communications efforts around the issue			0
mindful of the tense divisions and appetite from the @entity15 base for a high - profile fight about @entity19 , @entity3 will continue to say publicly that all options are on the table			1
after the meeting he repeated his public position to reporters , saying , " we 've made no decisions about how we 're going to proceed " on the funding bill			0
@entity3 throws polling punch on president			0
