visitors to the houses of @entity2 on friday may have seen more than they bargained for			1
protesters against new rules limiting online pornography gathered to simulate some of the now - banned sex acts , including " face - sitting			1
" the campaigners aimed to highlight what they say are arbitrary and sexist changes to the law that do n't distinguish between consensual and nonconsensual acts between adults			1
but to spare onlookers ' blushes ( and a potential brush with the law ) , those taking part in what was dubbed the # @entity17 on @entity18 remained fully clothed			0
the new regulations , which came into force on december 1 , ban various acts being depicted in online pornography produced in the @entity27 , including face - sitting , female ejaculation and spanking , in part to protect children from being exposed to potentially harmful content			1
however , they do not make it illegal for people to watch videos produced outside @entity27 or to perform the acts themselves			1
one of the protest organizers is @entity40 , winner of the @entity27 sex worker of the year title in 2013 and a free - speech advocate			1
she told @entity44 that the bill could be perceived as being sexist because the banning of certain acts appears to target women 's sexual enjoyment			2
" this is about censorship , and what the government is doing is they 're censoring our consent -- so yes , it does affect women , but it also affects every man and every woman , " she said			0
" it affects anybody who enjoys these particular activities			1
" consenting adults @entity40 says she believes the law will be ineffective and will impinge on people 's personal liberty and right to freedom of expression			0
" the whole point of the law was to protect people against violent acts of sex , but who can state what is violence when you 've got consenting adults ? " she said			1
the law wo n't stop people from performing the banned acts , she said			1
" all it 's doing is adding more frustration and concern to the public that we are coming away from democracy " and moving toward more government control			0
her @entity92 event page for the protest reminds people to bring a mat to lie on and to learn the words to @entity98 's " @entity99 " song			0
' canary in the coalmine of free speech ' @entity103 , a lawyer specializing in sexual liberties and obscenity law , has also opposed the new regulations			2
" @entity107 is the canary in the coalmine of free speech : it is the first freedom to die			0
if this assault on liberty is allowed to go unchallenged , other freedoms will fall as a consequence , " he wrote on his blog			0
what he describes as a " declaration of state censorship " will affect millions of consenting adults who choose to view @entity27 pornography , he said			2
it will also impose an unnecessary barrier to trade , hitting independent content producers within the @entity27 and costing the @entity126 tax revenue , he said			1
besides these issues , @entity103 said , the law " is practically unworkable as it can be circumvented by proxy servers ; and has implications for all forms of freedom of expression on the internet			0
" speaking to @entity44 at the protest in central @entity137 , he said ideas on social values and sexual morality among the general public were about 15 years ahead of those held by those making the laws			0
" free speech is fought on the fringes , and it 's the mainstream which is at risk of falling if the fringes are n't protected , so this is a very strong free speech issue , " he said			0
@entity40 also warned that the new regulations would affect smaller , independent @entity27 pornography producers rather than the big websites			2
one lawmaker , @entity152 of the @entity153 , put forward a motion in @entity2 last week calling for the new measures , set out in the @entity156 2014 , to be annulled			0
the protesters hope that by causing a stir outside @entity2 , others may back their case for it to be dropped .			2
