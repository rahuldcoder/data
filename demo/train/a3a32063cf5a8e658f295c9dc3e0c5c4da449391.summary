-- former @entity3 seal @entity1 said in an interview with the @entity5 that he was the one who fired the final shot to kill @entity7 in 2011			1
two special operations sources confirmed to me that @entity1 was one of the shooters in @entity7 's room			1
but did he really kill @entity7 ? and , ultimately , does it even really matter who shot @entity7 since the @entity2 raid in @entity16 , @entity12 was so clearly a team effort			1
@entity1 has told his story before in a lengthy profile in @entity20 in 2013 in which @entity1 was described not with his real name but only as " the shooter			2
" in the @entity20 piece , @entity1 / the shooter was said to have encountered @entity24 's leader face - to - face in the top - floor bedroom of the compound in @entity16 where he 'd been hiding for more than five years			1
@entity22 said the @entity24 leader was standing up and had a gun " within reach , " and it was only then that the shooter fired two shots into @entity7 's forehead , killing him			1
that account was in conflict with the narrative from another raid participant in a wildly successful book , " @entity39			0
" another member of the secretive @entity41 , which executed the @entity7 raid , told @entity0 the story of the shooter as presented in @entity20 is false			2
according to this serving @entity41 operator , the story is " complete bs			0
" twenty - three seals and their interpreter launched the assault on the bin laden compound just after midnight on the morning of may 2 , 2011			0
they shot and killed @entity7 's two bodyguards , one of @entity7 's sons and the wife of one of the bodyguards			1
they also wounded two other women			0
the first three seals to make it to the top floor of the compound were " the point man , " " the shooter " profiled by @entity20 , and @entity39 , the seal who wrote " @entity39 " under the pseudonym @entity67			0
what actually happened the night of the raid , according to the @entity41 operator who i interviewed , is that the " point man " ran up the stairs to the top floor and shot @entity7 in the head when he saw what looked like @entity7 poking his head out of his bedroom door			1
the shot gravely wounded @entity24 's leader			0
having taken down @entity7 , the point man proceeded to rush two women he found in the bedroom , gathering them in his arms to absorb the explosion in case they were wearing suicide vests , something that was a real concern of those who planned the raid			2
two more seals then entered @entity7 's bedroom and , seeing that he was lying mortally wounded on the floor , finished him off with shots to the chest			1
this account of @entity7 's demise is considerably less heroic than the shooter 's version in @entity20 , in which he says he shot @entity7 while he was standing up and only after he saw that the @entity24 leader had a gun within reach			1
the @entity41 operator who spoke to me says there is no way @entity100 could have seen a gun in @entity7 's reach because the two guns that were found in the bedroom after the shooting were only discovered after a thorough search and were sitting on a high shelf above the frame of the door that opened to the room			1
the seal operator also points out there was a discussion before the raid in which the assault team was told " do n't shoot the guy ( @entity7 ) in the face unless you have to " because the @entity126 would need to analyze good pictures of @entity7 's face for its facial recognition experts to work effectively			1
yet the shooter in the @entity20 story says he shot @entity7 on purpose twice in the forehead			2
a @entity135 official familiar with the details of the raid said the @entity41 operator 's version is in line with what happened			2
that account " has it right in my view , " the official said			0
the @entity41 operator also tells @entity0 that the shooter was " thrown off " the @entity147 , the core of the @entity41 group that carried out the @entity7 raid , because he was bragging about his role in the raid in bars around @entity154 , @entity155 , where @entity41 is based			2
in the @entity20 article , the shooter complains he is receiving no pension , since he left the military four years before the minimum 20 years required to be eligible			0
after the article appeared , @entity0 spoke with @entity160 , the @entity20 writer who says he passed along @entity0 's written questions about the shooter 's role in the raid to his story 's main character			0
the shooter did not respond to those questions			0
@entity168 , a spokeswoman for @entity20 , said via email the magazine stood by its story			0
" the @entity20 article , ' the shooter : the man who killed @entity7 , ' in the march 2013 issue , is based on information from numerous sources , including members of @entity178 himself , as well as detailed descriptions of mission debriefs			1
" according to present and former members of @entity41 , the " point man " who fired the shot that likely mortally wounded @entity7 will never " in a million years " speak publicly about his role in the raid , and they lauded his courageous decision to throw himself on the two women in @entity7 's room			1
the new account of the @entity7 raid provided by the serving @entity41 operator is essentially the same as in @entity195 's " @entity39			1
" @entity195 says he was one of the first to run into the bedroom and he saw that the point man 's shots had mortally wounded @entity7			1
@entity195 says he then shot the dying @entity24 leader as he lay on the floor			0
present and former members of @entity41 say they regard @entity195 as more credible than the shooter			0
balanced against that , according to a story filed by @entity0 's @entity207 last year after the publication of " @entity39 , " the head of @entity135 special operations , adm. @entity203 , contacted members of the navy seal team that killed @entity7			1
according to @entity212 officials , the @entity2 said @entity7 was standing in his bedroom when he was shot , and they believed that he posed a threat because there were weapons in the room			0
this account tends to bolster the story @entity220 told @entity20			0
in a previous @entity0 story about the @entity20 profile , i noted that i was the only outside observer allowed to tour @entity7 's @entity16 compound before it was demolished in late february 2012			1
during that tour , i looked around the bedroom where @entity7 was killed			2
the @entity12 military officers who were guiding me pointed out a patch of dark , dried blood on the low ceiling of @entity7 's bedroom			1
this patch of congealed blood seems to be consistent with the shooter 's story that he fired two shots at the forehead of a " surprisingly tall terrorist " while he was standing up			0
at the time , the precise location of @entity7 when he was shot was not a matter of dispute			2
but the blood patch could also be consistent with the account that it was the " point man " who first shot @entity7			2
the point man is 5 feet 6 inches tall and was shooting upward at a tall man as he poked his head out of his bedroom			0
the compound is , of course , now gone , so it is no longer possible to reconstruct what happened the night of the raid based on forensic evidence			0
finally , by all accounts , it was a confusing situation the night of the raid			0
one of the seal team 's helicopters had crashed , and there was a firefight with one of @entity7 's bodyguards			1
all the electricity in the compound and the surrounding neighborhood was off on a moonless night and the @entity2 were wearing night vision goggles , which only allowed them limited vision			0
what seems incontrovertible is that the point man , the shooter and @entity195 were the first three seals to assault @entity7 's bedroom			1
but to determine exactly which of them killed him might never be possible			0
what is certain is that it was a team effort			1
five days after the @entity7 raid , members of the seal team who carried out the mission briefed president @entity287			2
according to those in the room , the seal team commander explained to the president , " if you took one person out of the puzzle , we would n't have the competence to do the job we did ; everybody 's vital			0
it 's not about the guy who pulled the trigger to kill @entity7 , it 's about what we all did together			2

three years after @entity7 's death , @entity1 says he was the one who killed him
@entity304 says the killing was a team effort and there is some dispute over what happened
