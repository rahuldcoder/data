-- the @entity2 administration is asking a special federal court to allow its secret storage of telephone records to be extended beyond the current five - year limit			1
in a legal brief filed with the @entity9 that was revealed wednesday , the @entity7 said several civil lawsuits over the government 's so - called metadata collection program require it to preserve those records			1
" when litigation is pending against a party ( or reasonably anticipated ) , that party has a duty to preserve -- that is to identify , locate and maintain -- relevant information that may be evidence in the case , " said federal officials , noting that evidence would likely be used at a trial , which may not be held for months , even years			2
current surveillance court orders require the @entity24 or telecommunication companies that gathered the phone records to destroy the material within five years			1
the court is likely to grant the request , but may seek assurances the agency would not access the material for intelligence - gathering purposes , absent a warrant			2

it includes phone numbers called and their location			0
the exact percentage of metadata being collected has not been revealed publicly			0
monitoring of actual conversations requires a separate warrant			0
president @entity2 last month cited privacy concerns when announcing that such data should no longer be held by the government , but instead be turned over to the domestic telecoms or a private third party			1
@entity24 would still have access to the calls to track potential terror connections			0
he ordered the intelligence community to formulate such a plan by march 28			0
the mission of the @entity68 court , named after the @entity68 that created it , is to decide whether to grant certain types of government requests -- wiretapping , data analysis , and other monitoring for " foreign intelligence purposes " of suspected terrorists and spies operating in the @entity78			1
the once - secret approval of collecting bits and pieces of information from electronic communications comes quarterly from judges at the court			2
to collect the information , the government has to demonstrate to a judge that it is " relevant " to an international terrorism investigation			0
there were 1,856 applications in 2012 to the @entity9 for electronic surveillance and physical searches for " foreign intelligence purposes , " the @entity7 said			2
the current case is in re : application of the @entity97 for an order requiring the @entity99 ( @entity100 14 - 01 ) .			0
