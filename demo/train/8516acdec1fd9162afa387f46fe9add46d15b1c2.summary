editor 's note : @entity2 has a business partnership with @entity4 , which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to @entity2			2
@entity8 , who plays @entity9 on " @entity9 ? " would make approximately $ 145 , 051			2
the guys from @entity12 's comedy series " @entity13 " have it pretty good			0
lounging by the pool every day , buying ( and selling ) movies , last - minute trips to @entity18 , driving luxury cars , private jets with @entity21 to @entity22 , @entity23 ... no big deal			0
what i 'd like to know is how do they afford it ? last i checked , @entity29 , whose character is an up - and - coming actor , was making a good chunk of money ; but he 's also spending a lot			0
he 's paying his half - brother , @entity36 - nominated @entity35 " to be his personal chef and trainer ; he finances @entity40 's career as his manager ; and as for @entity42 ... well , he spends whatever money he has on illegal substances			0
so how do they do it ? @entity48 -- they 're fictional characters			0
in real - life , money does n't grow on trees like it seems to on @entity53			1
would our favorite characters ' lavish lifestyles make it in on the other side of the tv screen ? here 's a look at what some of this year 's emmy - nominated tv characters would make in the real world : @entity64 , " @entity65 " -- forensics expert real - life median salary : $ 47,680 , according to the @entity68			1
@entity65 ( @entity69 ) only uses his job as a forensic blood spatter analyst as a cover for his night - time job -- as a serial killer who kills bad guys			2
even though he earns a decent amount , we 're pretty sure money is not his top priority -- it 's getting rid of the bad guys			0
@entity82 , " @entity9 ? " -- vice president , real estate firm real - life median salary : $ 145 , 051 , according to @entity86			1
the " old " @entity9 ( @entity8 ) was only concerned about money , cars and designer clothes , which her six - figure salary supported			0
but " new " @entity9 has far different interests , which include becoming a better person while living -- for free -- at mom and dad 's			0
whichever lifestyle she continues , it 's likely it wo n't break her bank account			2
@entity100 , " @entity101 " -- creative director , advertising agency real - life median salary : $ 41,379 , according to @entity86			1
as a successful businessman in the 1960s , @entity100 ( @entity105 ) would probably make less than today 's median salary			1
despite that , he certainly made enough to cover the expenses of his " picture - perfect " lifestyle -- featuring cigarettes and liquor , a wife and two kids , and his extramarital affairs			0
@entity117 , " @entity118 " -- waitress real - life median salary : $ 15,850 , according to the @entity68			1
presumably @entity117 ( @entity120 ) does n't rake in much additional money from tips from her services at @entity118 , the financially - failing restaurant where she works			0
something tells us she 's not in it for the money -- she just wants to be near @entity129 , head pie maker and apple of her eye			0
@entity134 , " @entity135 " -- chiropractor real - life median salary : $ 65,890 , according to the @entity68			1
that salary combined with free room - and - board at his brother 's house on the beach , @entity134 ( @entity138 ) is probably doing just fine supporting himself and his son			2
what we ca n't figure out is why his brother @entity147 ( @entity148 ) , a mediocre jingle writer , is the one with the @entity150 villa and not @entity134 , the well - to - do chiropractor			1
@entity151 , " @entity152 : @entity153 " -- detective , special victims unit real - life median salary : $ 58 , 260 , according to the @entity68			1
@entity151 's ( @entity158 ) salary as a detective in the @entity153 leaves a little room for personal luxury -- if she ever chooses to put herself before her job and indulge in herself a little			2
@entity163 , " @entity164 " -- high school chemistry teacher real - life median salary : $ 49 , 420 , according to the @entity68			1
@entity163 's ( @entity168 ) salary as a high school chemistry teacher is n't quite enough to pay for his chemotherapy treatments ; good thing he 's got a drug - dealing gig on the side that brings in enough to foot his hospital bills -- and then some			1
dr. @entity175 , " @entity176 " -- psychotherapist real - life median salary : $ 180,000 for a psychiatrist , according to the @entity68			1
" a penny for your thoughts , " is an understatement for @entity175 ( @entity181 )			2
even though she 's technically retired from her position as a therapist , based on this salary , she probably secured a nice nest egg and does n't need to charge her only client , @entity189			1
@entity129 , " @entity118 " -- head pie maker , general manager real - life median salary : $ 21,241 , according @entity193			1
@entity129 ( @entity194 ) probably makes a little more than this as the owner of his restaurant , which is near broke			0
to pad his pockets in the meantime , @entity129 helps a private investigator bring murder victims back from the dead to gather details to solve their murders , collecting reward money in the end			0
that should be enough to buy pie ingredients for a lifetime			0
@entity210 , " @entity211 " -- @entity212 , women 's gym real - life median salary : $ 55,201 for a health and fitness supervisor , according to @entity86			1
as the owner of a women 's gym , @entity210 ( @entity217 ) probably makes upward of this listed salary			2
whatever it is , it 's certainly enough to fund her text message costs for her weekly votes to " @entity225			0
the information contained in this article may not be published , broadcast or otherwise distributed without the prior written authority			0

@entity64 , a forensics expert from " @entity65 , " would earn $ 47,680 in real life
@entity163 from " @entity164 " deals drugs to support his teacher 's salary
dr. @entity175 from " in treatment " would make $ 180,000 as a psychiatrist
the jingle writer in " @entity135 " probably would n't own an *oceanside* villa
