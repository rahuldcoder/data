setting off from @entity15 on saturday , many of the cars taking part in the biennial , 3,021 - kilometer ( 1,877 - mile ) @entity13 to @entity14 look more like ping - pong tables on wheels rather than conventional cars			1
however , the spirit of adventure and quest for more energy efficiency is what drives the teams of volunteers , university students and organizers			1
" we think about it in terms of the land - based version of ocean yacht racing , " says @entity28 , the event director			2
" really it 's about how much you can do with how little			0
we 're looking for the ultimate efficiency in electric cars			1
" this year is the 11th race and @entity28 is happy to point out that while most of the cars do n't resemble anything else that will be rumbling down the @entity5 highways this weekend , some of the innovations pioneered by the vehicles over the years have made it into the mainstream			1
energy - efficient , " low - rolling resistance " tires that are on the market now were used by @entity50 in @entity13 events of the early 1990s , and since the inaugural event in 1987 the electric motors have improved in efficiency by at least 30 % , says @entity28			1
some of the motors being used by teams have been engineered to work at 98 % efficiency in turning electricity into motor power			1
" that could drive a washing machine , ceiling fan or even electric vehicle , " says @entity28			0
" there are many uses for a motor like that in our daily lives across a range of applications			0
" for the top teams , though , the aim is to get to @entity14 first and worry about the legacy of the technology later			1
@entity79 's @entity78 car is one of the favorites to win this year 's competition			1
as winners of the events from 2001 to 2007 , @entity79 , made up of students from the @entity86 in the @entity87 , hope to claim back the crown they lost in 2009 to @entity91 's @entity90 's team			0
to aid their attempt , @entity92 is made of a carbon fiber also used by some @entity96 cars , making it 10 % lighter than its predecessor in 2009			2
and like @entity96 , strategy is expected to be important in giving each team the edge			0
each team has to extract enough power from a battery with just 5 kilowatt hours of capacity ( 10 % of the power competitors are anticipated to need to complete the race ) , while also judging when to charge it up for the next day			2
" the biggest challenge is to drive non-stop , but we 've got a good chance , " says @entity79 's @entity108			0
for others , making a solar car more appealing to the public is a greater priority than seeing the checkered flag first			2
to highlight that solar cars are getting closer to the real thing , @entity118 in @entity120 's @entity119 has shunned the sleek , aerodynamic design seen by @entity122 and others in favor of something more recognizable with two doors and two seats			1
that the @entity119 can still effectively compete the race is thanks in part to improvements in solar and motor technology in recent years , and a new competition rule that has reduced the solar panel capacity allowed on each car by 25 % compared to 2009			1
" they 've got to use that energy wisely to get up hills and get out from under clouds , " says @entity28			2
" by keeping some reins on some of these keys factors , we 're seeing some very clever ways in addressing them			0
" but for all the goodwill and innovation on offer , when the rubber hits the road it will still be a race			0
" our aim as a team is to win , " says @entity108 from @entity79			0
" although personally , for each of us , it 's about the experience and adventure , learning and preparing for the future			0

solar - powered car race from @entity15 to @entity14
aim is to highlight the ultimate in *renewable* energy - efficiency
teams from 21 countries *compeiting* in the 11th competition
cars will reach speeds over *100kmph* using same power that runs a toaster
