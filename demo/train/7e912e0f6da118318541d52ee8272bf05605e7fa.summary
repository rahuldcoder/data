" we simply can not tolerate at any time having someone with terrorist ties working at a nuclear plant , period , " sen. @entity12 , a @entity14 @entity13 , said in a written statement saturday			2

the @entity45 said it was working with the @entity24 to determine whether @entity25 had access to any sensitive areas of the nuclear plants where he once worked , spokeswoman @entity44 said			1
