-- a group of native @entity2 occupied the grounds of the old @entity6 monarchy 's royal residence wednesday , vowing to stay and do the business of the kingdom 's government			1
a member of the protest group @entity11 unlocks the palace gate			2
" it is through a greater realm than ours " that the group took this action , said @entity13 , elected leader of the group , called @entity11			0
" today and every day , we will be here to assume our role			0
" group members left the palace grounds wednesday afternoon , but vowed to return thursday morning , the @entity23 reported			1
" we 'll be here at 6 o'clock in the morning , " @entity13 told the newspaper			0
the group is one of several in @entity30 that reject statehood and seek to return to the constitutional monarchy that effectively ended in 1893 when a group of politicians , businessmen and sugar planters -- aided by the @entity38 minister to @entity30 -- overthrew the kingdom 's government			1
the monarchist groups say that the kingdom was overthrown and annexed into the @entity38 illegally			1
@entity30 's office of the attorney general did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment on wednesday 's action			1
the staff of @entity49 , built in 1882 and now operated as a museum , shut down the building to visitors			0
the 60 or so protesters occupied the grounds , chaining the gates and stationing guards there to explain to visitors the purpose of the action			1
the group later reopened the gates , but remained on the grounds and the building was kept closed			1
" it saddens my heart to have to turn away visitors , " said palace staff member @entity63 , who added that although she , too , is a native @entity6 , she does not understand the actions of the group			1
@entity63 also said that the group appeared peaceful and she was not concerned about security			2
@entity71 , a visitor to @entity30 from @entity72 , told @entity74 's @entity73 that he was " disappointed " he would n't be able to visit the ornate palace and " learn about the culture of the @entity77			1
" " we wanted to come here precisely because we thought we 'd learn something about the history of @entity30 and the last queen and the monarchy , " said @entity71 , who said he had reservations for the visit			2
" but we 're leaving tomorrow so we wo n't get to see the palace			0
" but @entity71 also said he " kind of understood " the actions of the group			0
@entity72 and @entity30 , along with @entity87 and the @entity88 , were annexed into the @entity38 in 1898 after the @entity89			1
@entity87 and @entity72 remain territories of the @entity38			2
the @entity88 gained independence after @entity92 , and @entity30 became the 50th state in 1959			1
although the monarchy was not overthrown until 1893 , its fate effectively was sealed six years earlier when the same group that forced the overthrow imposed a new constitution on @entity99 , who was forced to sign it under threat of arms			0
the document dramatically reduced the authority of the monarchy and instituted voter requirements that limited voting to wealthy businessmen and @entity6 landowners , barring 75 percent of the native hawaiian population and all @entity110			2
when @entity113 @entity112 ascended the throne after the death of her brother in 1891 , she began work on a new constitution that would have effectively reversed the 1887 document			0
with the help of @entity121 , the @entity38 minister to @entity30 , the elite group that had changed the constitution in 1887 opposed the queen 's actions			1
two years later , under threat of @entity38 troops , she yielded her authority , saying , " until such time as the @entity129 shall ... undo the action of its representative and reinstate me in the authority which i claim as the constitutional sovereign of the @entity135			2
" the queen was later imprisoned in @entity49 for eight months for her participation in an attempted 1895 revolt , until she relinquished her claim to the throne in return for her release			0
she died in 1917 at 79			0
in 1993 , the @entity143 approved , and president @entity144 signed , an apology to the people of the @entity135			0
the document " acknowledges that the overthrow of the @entity148 occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the @entity38 and further acknowledges that the @entity6 people never directly relinquished to the @entity38 their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands , either through the @entity148 or through a plebiscite or referendum			1
" although it was used as a seat of government for decades after the deposition of @entity112 , the palace fell into disrepair			0
when the last of the government office moved out and into new facilities adjacent to the palace in 1969 , restoration work began			0
it opened to the public in 1978			0

group does not recognize @entity30 as a @entity38 state
