-- on december 15 , 2001 , @entity2 border troops came across some 30 @entity4 fighters in a mountain pass			2
they had fled the @entity7 bombardment of @entity8 , @entity9 's last stronghold in @entity10			1
the group turned out to be members of the @entity4 leader 's security detail , and @entity7 intelligence swiftly dubbed them the " @entity16			1
" they were transferred to @entity7 custody in @entity18 and then moved to the @entity19 in @entity20 early in 2002			0
it soon transpired most of the " @entity16 " were from @entity22 , a country where @entity4 has an even greater presence today than it did before 9/11			1
analysis of many profiles of @entity19 detainees suggest that becoming a member of @entity4 in @entity22 in the late 1990s was relatively easy , which may explain why ( after @entity10 and @entity28 ) @entity22 comprised the third largest group held there			1
the documents , compiled by the @entity7 @entity31 at @entity19 , show that : -- a network of @entity4 recruiters was able to operate in @entity22 with virtual impunity			1
-- @entity36 religious institutes in @entity22 influenced many to take up jihad and join @entity9			1
-- many of the recruits had little education and few opportunities			0
the documents were obtained by @entity43 and published this week			2
several religious institutes in @entity22 were fertile @entity4 recruiting grounds , according to the documents			1
they included @entity48 in @entity49 , the @entity50 in @entity51 and the @entity52			0
the founder of the @entity50 , @entity54 , is described in the documents as " one of the most influential @entity22 @entity58 leaders who preached and financed jihad			2
" ( he was also an influence on @entity9 's thinking , but consistently opposed violence against other @entity63			1
) from the @entity50 , recruits were taken to a training camp in @entity22 where they would learn assassination techniques and bomb - making			2
rarely did the @entity22 authorities interfere			2
in fact , the documents suggest @entity22 officials could be bribed to provide medical releases and alter travel documents			1
recruiters also had money to assist with airline tickets			0
@entity4 expands presence in @entity22 one of the recruiters was @entity78 , a @entity22 who " had access to the identities of many @entity4 - related travelers and plausible knowledge of the detainees ' travel times and locations , " according to the documents			1
@entity87 , who died in 2001 , and other radical imams in @entity22 also provided money to several of the jihadists who would end up among the " @entity16			1
" many of the young @entity22 who ended up in @entity9 's security detail were capable fighters but poorly educated			1
@entity94 failed 11th grade three times and worked as a bus driver before turning to jihad			0
another detainee never made it past seventh grade , while @entity102 finally got his high school diploma at 22			0
several had odd jobs and felt unable to support their families			0
frequently , recruitment into @entity4 was a family affair			0
among those captured in that freezing mountain pass in @entity2 was a 21 - year - old by the name of @entity113			0
his brother was also an @entity4 fighter and he allegedly had ties to several @entity4 members responsible for the attack on the @entity118 in 1998			0
@entity119 and his brother were both bodyguards to @entity9			0
2010 : @entity118 crew praised at memorial the @entity22 recruits were given similar basic training before being deployed to the front near @entity127 to fight against the @entity128 as members of @entity4 's elite @entity130			1
they later became @entity9 's bodyguards , according to the profiles			1
the documents say several of the " @entity16 " also took part in a close combat course that @entity9 used to select militants for special operations			1
some of the @entity22 were fast - tracked for advanced training			0
@entity139 would later train for an aborted @entity4 operation in southeast @entity141 to hijack airliners and crash them into @entity7 military bases in the region			0
@entity9 planned to use @entity22 in the operation because they could easily travel to the region , according to another detainee			2
others ran training camps or safe houses			0
@entity150 was one ; he was at large until 2008 , when he was killed in @entity22			0
the @entity19 documents might be solely of historical interest were it not for @entity22 's chronic instability today , and the growing presence of @entity4 in the @entity156 in the provinces of @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160			1
even though @entity22 security forces have stepped up operations against @entity4 in the last year , @entity7 officials describe @entity4 in the @entity156 as the most effective operational arm of the group			1
@entity166 , assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism , said in december the group was " increasingly active " in reaching out to find terrorist recruits , even in the @entity7 , and was " the most operationally active node of the @entity4 network			2
" it was in @entity22 that the alleged @entity174 " underwear " bomber was recruited and trained in 2009			0
@entity4 in the @entity156 militants have killed dozens of @entity22 soldiers and police ; earlier this month @entity180 militants briefly occupied a town in southern @entity22 and raided an ammunition factory			2
the @entity19 documents suggest that @entity22 remains a recruiting ground for @entity4 , with one written in 2008 saying @entity22 sheikhs " continue to recruit @entity22 youth to participate in hostilities against @entity7 and coalition forces			1
" that 's perhaps why today so many @entity22 are left at @entity19			2
the risk of sending them home to a volatile country with a history of jail breaks and a vibrant @entity4 franchise is too great			0
of the 112 @entity22 taken to the detention center over the past nine years , nearly 90 are still there			0
( the @entity196 , which has seen all the @entity19 documents , reports that 23 have been sent back to @entity22 and two died in custody			2
) few of those left are likely to be leaving anytime soon .			0

@entity43 releases documents on @entity4 detainees from @entity22
among the detainees are the " @entity16 , " part of @entity9 's security detail
documents describe several religious institutes in @entity22 as recruiters for @entity4
