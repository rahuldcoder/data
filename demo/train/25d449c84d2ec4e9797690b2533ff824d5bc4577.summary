@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the foothills of @entity1 's @entity6 mountains , artists are partnering with doctors and scientists to create life - changing products			1
in a small strip of commercial buildings in this town northeast of @entity14 , you 'll find @entity16 's @entity15			2
the modest lobby opens up into a pristine production lab filled with skilled glassblowers , blue - flaming torches and dazzling glass models of the human heart , brain and vascular system			2
" it 's science , and it 's art , " said @entity25 , @entity16 's production manager			1
@entity16 's @entity15 makes the glass organs and vascular models used by medical - device manufacturers in preliminary testing to determine whether their products will work in real - life situations			1
for example , a medical company could request a glass model be built to spec for testing a new heart - valve catheter			1
@entity16 's glassblowing team would then create a heart connected to a vascular system connected to a custom opening in the femoral artery of the leg			1
the company then uses that model for research and development to test catheter deployment			0
" a lot of these models are @entity51 approved for these companies so that they can use it as a true proving ground to get to the next level of testing , " @entity25 told @entity2			2
when @entity2 visited the shop , @entity25 was working on one of his more remarkable pieces -- what he calls a " demonstrator heart model			2
" he uses ct scans , medical illustrations and even casts taken from cadavers to create an anatomically precise model of the human heart			0
each component of the model is made by hand to customer specifications			0
" sometimes doctors want an aneurysm in them , sometimes they want diseased hearts , " @entity25 said as he spun molten glass			1
" so each one is unique			0
" the glass hearts also have educational value			1
cardiologists can connect the models to a water pump to simulate blood flow			1
and medical students use the glass tubes to practice catheter or stent placement			0
although demand from the science and medical industry can fluctuate , @entity25 says @entity16 's @entity15 has shown steady growth			1
" we ship all over the world from @entity94 to @entity95 to @entity96 , " he says , " so we have been able to expand into global ( markets ) instead of regional			0
" the now - international company has humble roots			0
@entity16 , the company 's founder , started glassblowing more than 30 years ago in the @entity101			1
like many artists , he started out making simple glass toys and figurines to sell at malls			1
@entity16 quickly realized there was n't a lot of money to be made in glass art , so he focused on scientific glassware			1
" @entity16 always had grand ideas , he was always one to push the envelope , " says @entity25 , who is @entity16 's nephew			1
" he was never satisfied with small			0
" @entity16 passed away last year , but his legacy as an artist and entrepreneur lives on			0
it was after he took a more business - like approach to glassblowing that he caught a big break			0
a medical manufacturer asked him to make angioplasty balloon molds out of glass			0
@entity16 's @entity15 was born			2
" the ' a-ha ' moment was when he found out that he could turn a metal part that was made in the medical industry into glass and he could produce it for way cheaper than anyone else , " @entity25 said			1
prices for @entity16 's glass organs today start at several hundred dollars			1
in 1994 , @entity16 moved the blossoming business from the @entity101 to @entity0 , where then 13 - year - old @entity25 started an apprenticeship			1
" after doing four summers with him , i said , ' this is what i love to do			0
this is a great medium to work in , ' " he said			0
later , after graduating college , @entity25 joined the company full time			2
he likes that the work combines creativity with helping advance the state of medical research			0
" it 's art , it 's handcrafted and it 's used for something that could potentially save someone 's life , " he said with a smile , " it makes me feel good that i 'm involved in helping people			1
" before @entity2 arrived at the shop , the glassblowing team assembled a full - scale human model named " mrs. @entity157 , " or " mrs. e " for short			2
the model began with just one piece , the center of the brain			0
then the team built out the rest of the brain and added a heart , veins , lungs and vascular components for the arms and legs -- all created by glassblowing			0
" this is the collaboration of all the years of making different models and taking all that knowledge and putting it into one cohesive piece of glass , " said @entity25			2
yes , pieces of mrs. e have been broken			0
and if you 're thinking of buying a full - body glass model like mrs. e for yourself , be prepared to spend around $ 25,000 .			0
