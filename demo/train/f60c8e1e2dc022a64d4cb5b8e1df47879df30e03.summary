-- i wear the burqa for the simple reason that i am a @entity4 and the @entity5 says that i must wear the full veil in order to be modest			1
i am proud of my @entity4 faith and my modesty			1
i am proud to follow @entity11 's law			0
nobody ever forced me to wear the full veil and i have been wearing it for around 10 years now			1
in fact , very few of my friends actually wear one			2
there are , of course , situations in which some men force their wives or daughters to wear the burqa but , believe me , these cases are a very , very small minority			1
for those of us who are believers , we just want to do @entity11 's will and live by the sacred text , so what any man says has nothing to do with that			0
i am testament to that as i do n't have a husband and i practice my religion freely , that 's why i 'm always shocked when people say it 's the husband who forces his wife to wear a burqa			1
it is actually the case that a lot of men in @entity45 do not wish their wives to wear the full veil because when they go out , they are insulted or attacked and their husbands do n't want them to be put in that situation			1
i first started wearing the full veil when i was a teenager but i stopped for a while because when you 're young , you do n't want to be set apart , you want to look like everyone else			2
but later after seeing what was happening with terrorist attacks involving @entity4 all over the world , i decided to become more conscious and find out more about my faith			1
in the process , i found myself becoming more spiritual and decided to start wearing the burqa			0
now , my liberty is being threatened with this law proposed by the @entity45 government			2
if this law is passed , it will be a great injustice			0
it is very unfair that they are even considering this law			0
perhaps the @entity45 authorities are terrified that women will start dressing like this , despite evidence to the contrary			2
why am i , as a @entity4 woman , targeted unfairly , when there are less than 2,000 of us in @entity45 who wear the burqa ? where is my freedom of clothing or expression ? @entity45 prides itself as a country that upholds the rights of man but where are my rights ? why am i not free to wear what i want ? many cite security reasons because they ca n't tell who is under the veil			1
but myself and a lot of women who wear the burqa are always happy to identify ourselves when asked			2
in the past , i have taken off my veil when it is asked of me -- as long as it 's a woman who does it			0
my religion demands that i cover my face in front of any man who is not either my brother , father or husband			0
i have been wearing the veil in @entity45 for years and it has never been a problem , i use public transport like everyone else and i 've never had any problems			1
although , it can be quite strange when i 'm on a bus for example and people say to me : ' you poor thing , we feel sorry for you			0
' and i wonder exactly why they feel sorry for me			0
i 'm very happy wearing the veil and it makes me spiritually fulfilled as i 'm practicing my religion , so i do n't really see it as anything to pity me for			0
i really believe that @entity45 is scared of @entity4 , which is the motivation for this law , but people should n't generalize as not all @entity4 are the same			1
yes , some have done terrible things , but it is done in the name of man , never in the name of @entity11			0
i , as a @entity45 @entity4 woman , have nothing but love in my heart towards all people			1
and whatever the outcome , if @entity45 succeeds in banning the veil on its streets , i will never take mine off			1
my freedom means a lot to me and if this law is passed , i would rather move to another country where i can worship in peace			0
i obey the laws of @entity11 not the laws of man			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			2
