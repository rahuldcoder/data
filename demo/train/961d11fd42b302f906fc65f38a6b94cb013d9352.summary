-- for 20 years , it has circled quietly above us , capturing a dark , secret world billions of light years away			1
from black holes to primordial galaxies , the @entity5 has provided out - of - this - world images of space where no human has ever gone			1
@entity11 , the @entity12 and the @entity13 celebrated @entity5 's 20th year in orbit on saturday by releasing another stunning photo caught by the iconic telescope			1
the striking color shot shows a small portion of the @entity19 , " one of the largest seen star - birth regions in the galaxy , " according to @entity11			2
former @entity11 astronaut @entity23 , who flew on three service missions to @entity5 , said that inside those newborn stars " are the chemical elements ... that make up people			0
" time.com : greatest hits from @entity5 " the carbon and oxygen in our bodies was all built inside of stars , " he said , " @entity5 is answering fundamental scientific questions that in the end tell us about our earth , our solar system and ultimately how we were formed			2
" the photo , captured february 1 and 2 , is one of more than 500,000 images that @entity5 has taken -- captivating scientists and astronomy enthusiasts alike -- since it was launched into orbit by the space shuttle discovery on april 24 , 1990			1
" i never would have believed in 1990 that the @entity5 would have turned out this great , " said @entity48 , associate administrator of @entity11 's @entity49			2
" i knew it was going to be great , but it has just exceeded all of our expectations			0
" among its most famous findings , @entity5 has : -- helped astronomers discover dark energy , which exerts a repulsive force that works against gravity ; -- helped determine the age of the universe ( about 13.75 billion years old ) ; -- acted as a virtual time machine , providing glimpses into how the universe might have looked millions of years ago and helping shed light on how the giant galaxies we see today were formed ; -- helped identify the atmospheric makeup of planets beyond our solar system			1
@entity48 cites supermassive black holes , the largest type of black hole , as another of @entity5 's most prominent discoveries			1
" when @entity5 was launched in 1990 , supermassive black holes were a fantasy , a theory -- something you saw on ' @entity81 , ' " @entity48 said			0
" one of our goals was to ... find at least one and prove it exists			0
" as it turns out , @entity5 surprised us , " he said , " not only did it find one but it basically showed us that supermassive black holes are pervasive throughout the universe ... and they clearly play a role in the evolution of a universe			0
" despite its age , @entity5 is 100 times more powerful today than at the time of its launch , @entity11 says , thanks to its most recent visit by astronauts , including @entity23 , on a service mission last may			0
" we had hoped to get 10 to 15 years out of it with frequent shuttle visits every two and a half to three years , " @entity48 said			0
" as it turns out , we 're now 20 years into this program , and thanks to the work of @entity23 and the crew in the last mission , we 're looking forward to at least another five years and maybe even another seven , eight or nine or 10 years more			2

@entity5 helped to determine age of universe , shed light on how galaxies were formed
