-- @entity3 -- the 85 - year - old @entity4 detained by @entity2 authorities earlier this fall -- has been " deported , " @entity2 's state news agency @entity1 reported early saturday			1
his son announced late friday that he is on his way home to the @entity4			2
" we are absolutely delighted to confirm that @entity3 is on his way home , " @entity10 said			2
a senior @entity13 administration official said soon after the @entity2 announcement that @entity4 authorities have @entity3 " in hand			1
" @entity18 spokeswoman @entity17 subsequently tweeted that @entity4 @entity20 officials met " @entity3 at the airport in @entity22 and provided all appropriate consular assistance			1
" @entity24 showed him smiling as he walked past a cavalcade of reporters through the @entity29 capital 's airport			1
the out - of - the - blue release became all the more real for @entity3 's relatives in the @entity4 shortly before 8 p.m. ( 11 p.m. et ) , when they talked with @entity34 by phone , his family said			1
the @entity1 report stated that investigators determined that " @entity3 entered the @entity2 with a wrong understanding of it and perpetrated a hostile act against it			2
" " taking into consideration his admittance of the act committed by him on the basis of his wrong understanding ( and the ) apology made by him for it , his sincere repentance of it and his advanced age and health condition , the above - said institution deported him from the country from a humanitarian viewpoint , " the official @entity2 report added			1
on thursday , @entity17 said @entity4 officials had spoken the previous day with relatives of @entity3 and @entity57 , another @entity4 being held in @entity2 , but added little else			1
hours later , @entity17 issued a statement saying @entity60 was " pleased that mr. @entity3 has been allowed to depart the @entity2 and rejoin his family			1
" " we welcome the @entity2 's decision to release him			2
this positive decision by the @entity2 throws into sharper relief the continuing detention of ... @entity57 , " she added			0
" ... we call on the @entity2 once again to pardon and grant mr. @entity57 special amnesty and immediately release him as a humanitarian gesture so that he too can return home to his family			2
" coincidence or not , the news of @entity3 's release came on the day that vice president @entity73 was in @entity74 , where he was to lay a wreath at a memorial for veterans of the war that pitted @entity2 against its southern neighbor as well as the @entity4			1
@entity73 told reporters in @entity74 that he " played no direct role " in the release			0
he added that his office offered to let @entity3 fly home with him on @entity85 , but @entity18 officials said he 'd take a direct commercial flight to @entity88			0
" it 's a positive thing they 've done , " said the vice president , who talked saturday morning by phone with @entity3 , according to another @entity13 administration official			0
" but they still have mr. @entity57 , who has no reason being held in the @entity2 ( and ) should be released immediately			0
" former @entity97 gov. @entity96 , who has undertaken private diplomatic efforts with @entity2 seemed more perturbed over @entity3 's detention than he was pleased at his release			1
" while the release of @entity3 is welcome news indeed , he never should have been detained in the first place			2
the @entity2 should also release @entity57 as a humanitarian gesture , " @entity96 said in a statement			0
according to his family , @entity3 went on a 10 - day organized private tour of @entity2 in october			1
from phone calls and postcards he sent , the trip was going well and there was no indication of any kind of problem , son @entity10 said			0
the day before the @entity116 , @entity117 , resident was to leave , " one or two @entity2 authorities " met with @entity3 and his tour guide , the son added			1
they talked about @entity3 's service record , which left " my dad ... a bit bothered , " according to @entity10			1
then , just minutes before his @entity22 - bound plane was set to depart @entity125 in late october , he was taken off the aircraft by @entity2 authorities			1
for weeks , the @entity125 government did n't explain why they were holding @entity3			0
an explanation came a few days ago , when state media published and broadcast what they described as the @entity134 veteran 's " apology			0
" in fact , that word -- " apology " -- was written atop the first of four handwritten pages detailing his alleged indiscretions			0
in the note -- which was dated november 9 -- @entity3 talked about his having advised the @entity143 , part of the " intelligence bureau " fighting against @entity125 during the @entity134			0
he detailed how he commanded troops to collect " information " and wage various deadly attacks			0
" after i killed so many civilians and ( @entity2 ) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the @entity2 during the @entity134 , i committed indelible offensive acts against the @entity2 government and @entity2 people , " @entity3 said , according to that @entity1 report			2
the reported message also touched on his return 60 years later to @entity2 , admitting that he " shamelessly ... had a plan to meet any surviving soldiers and pray for the souls of the dead soldiers			0
" his statement ended : " if i go back to ( the ) @entity4 , i will tell the true features of the @entity2 and the life the @entity2 people are leading			2
" this public apology -- which @entity167 , professor @entity166 characterized as " highly scripted political theater " -- left some wondering what would happen to @entity3			1
would he join @entity57 , an @entity4 arrested in @entity2 in november 2012 who last may was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after @entity2 's government found him guilty of " hostile acts " and attempts to topple the government ? or would he be released ? as @entity166 said days ago : " when it comes to @entity2 , nobody knows very much			1
" @entity125 has long been regarded by many as a repressive state , with its insularity , sharp restrictions on speech and other freedoms , and decades of saber - rattling primarily targeting its chief foes , @entity74 and the @entity4			2
its isolation is exacerbated by widespread uproar over its nuclear program			0
the @entity191 nation 's reported quest to create a nuclear weapon , as well as its resistance to international monitoring of its activities , have resulted in economic sanctions , compounding difficulties in getting enough energy and food for its people			0
but there have been some indications of change of late			0
is @entity3 's release signal even more of an opening by @entity125 ? will it lead to even more of a thaw ? given the ups and mostly downs in these relationships , it 's hard to tell now what will happen			1
still , this news affects the global political landscape , at the least it appears that the @entity216 -- including @entity34 's wife , @entity218 , who last month told @entity0 that " we need to have @entity34 back at the head of the table for the holidays " -- should be complete once again			0
@entity0 's @entity223 and @entity224 contributed to this report .			0
