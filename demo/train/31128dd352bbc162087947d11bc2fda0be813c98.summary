-- the last white president of @entity2 said the post-apartheid land is still trekking toward prosperity for all and a better democracy			1
" fact is that in @entity2 , transition is taking its time , " @entity7 said in an interview aired thursday on " @entity9 , " hosted by @entity0 's @entity10			1
" i 'm convinced it 's a solid democracy and it will remain so , but it 's not a healthy democracy			1
" two decades ago , @entity7 joined with then - @entity18 leader @entity17 to end the notorious system of racial separation known as apartheid			1
their efforts led to a @entity24			2

" any democracy in which one party has 65 percent of the vote and all the other parties share in the remaining 35 is not healthy , " said @entity7 , who spoke with @entity10 during a summit of @entity33 laureates in @entity34			1
" on paper , we have a wonderful constitution			2
we 've had a number of successful , free elections			2
we 've had peaceful handover of power from one president to the other			2
so we really comply with the definition of a good democracy			2
but the party political situation needs to be normalized			2
" @entity51 said the system is failing to deliver to the people			2
" the main failure , why we have n't made better progress , " he said , " does not lie in any way whatsoever in the agreements we reached , which we negotiated between 1990 and 1994 and 1996			2
we agreed upon a good constitution , which is a transformational document			2
" it is practical policies which have failed to bring a better life to the masses , which led to the enrichment only of the few , also amongst the new black elite			2
the middle class is growing fast , but somehow or another , the quality of service delivery had deteriorated substantially			0
education has actually moved some steps backwards			0
" @entity51 cites high unemployment as a grinding problem , with a rate of 50 percent among blacks between ages 18 and 34			1
he was asked about a proposal by activist @entity78 for whites to pay a wealth tax , given their heritage of privilege			0
" i think already , if you analyze who pays tax , the tax structure is quite stringent on high - income earners , " he said			1
" inasmuch as the white forms the biggest percentage of high - income earners , they pay tax comparable to what very rich people pay in other countries			1
" the whites in @entity2 do n't mind putting their hands in their pockets			1
they realize that all of us share a joint destiny , a common destiny , that we need to win the war against poverty			0
there is n't a resistance against paying tax			0
" there is irritation if the high taxes paid are misspent			0
if there is not a frugal administration of the finances , if millions and millions are spent on non-worthwhile get - togethers and on luxury cars and on this and on that			1
there is not a resistance against being part of the solution by putting their hands deep in their pockets			0
" asked about a statement from @entity78 calling the @entity18 worse than the apartheid regime , @entity7 said he was " slightly surprised			1
" " i think it explains that those who say it 's only the whites who are concerned about what is happening at the moment , it demolishes that assumption			1
it proves that moderate , well - disposed , serious black @entity2 are as concerned about the loss of its moral compass by the present @entity18 leadership			1
" @entity17 became president of @entity2 on may 10 , 1994 , after decades of white minority rule			1
@entity51 said he and @entity17 have been " close friends			1
" " not the closest in the sense that we see each other once a week			0
but he 's been in my home as a guest ; i 've been in his home as a guest			2
when i go to @entity146 , my wife and i will have tea with him and @entity150 , his wife			0
no , we call each other on birthdays			0
" @entity17 is age 93 and @entity7 is 76			1
" there is no animosity left between us , " he said , even though there once were tensions " the main cause for the tensions when there were tensions between us was the ongoing political violence , " @entity51 explained			0
" his accusations and personal attacks upon me , as if i were responsible for it , as if i were looking away and allowing it to happen , not recognizing that extensive efforts which i made to identify the culprits			0
so that was the main cause of the tension			0
" he said he first met @entity17 when he was brought " under the cover of darkness " to his office from a prison where the longtime activist was being held			1
" i have read , of course , everything i could read about him beforehand			0
i was impressed , however , by how tall he was , by the ramrod straightness of his stature , and realized that this is a very special man			0
he had an aura around him			0
he still has an aura around him			0
he 's truly a very dignified and a very admirable person			2
" @entity51 said it was true that @entity17 said he had to persuade his associates " to sit down with the enemy			1
" " i had to convince some of my supporters in the same vein , " he said			0
" but can i say that from the beginning , in the negotiations , i realized that he was also a good listener , reaching out to the one speaking , trying to understand what lies behind what was being said			0
i felt it that first evening			0
and both of us later wrote in our respective autobiographies , after that very first meeting , we could report back to our constituencies , i think i can do business with this man			0
" @entity10 noted that @entity17 had once called @entity7 " a man of integrity " but had taken it back , regretting that @entity7 had never renounced the principle of apartheid			1
@entity51 said he was n't aware @entity17 said he " never renounced apartheid			1
" " i have made the most profound apology in front of the @entity217 and on other occasions about the injustices which were wrought by apartheid , " he said , referring to the panel established to help uncover past government errors and abuses and to foster amity			0
he said he has n't issued an apology for " the original concept of seeking to bring justice to all @entity2 through the concept of nation states , " the creation of separate black and white states			1
" in @entity2 it failed , " he said			1
" and by the end of the ' 70 's , we had to realize , and accept and admit to ourselves that it had failed			2
and that is when fundamental reform started			0
" he was then asked if apartheid failed because it was unworkable , or because it was simply morally repugnant			0
" there are three reasons it failed , " he said			0
" it failed because the whites wanted to keep too much land for themselves			0
it failed because we ( whites and blacks ) became economically integrated , and it failed because the majority of blacks said that is not how we want our rights			0
" still , @entity7 would not back off his belief in the validity of the original concept of " separate but equal " nation states			1
" i do n't apologize for saying that what drove me as a young man , before i decided we need to embrace a new vision , was a quest to bring justice for black @entity2 in a way which would not -- that 's what i believed then -- destroy the justice to which my people were entitled			1
my people , whose self - determination ( was ) taken away by colonial power in the @entity268			2
" that , @entity7 said , is how he was raised			1
" and it was in an era when also in @entity271 and elsewhere , and across the continent of @entity2 , there was still not this realization that we are trampling upon the human rights of people			1
so i 'm a convert			0

@entity7 is the last leader of white - ruled @entity2
he says the @entity18 is too powerful and that is a problem
there 's grinding unemployment in the country , he says
he says he and @entity17 are " close friends "
