@entity0 , @entity1 -- in february 1984 , a group of tech enthusiasts gathered in @entity5 , @entity6 , to share thoughts on three subjects -- technology , entertainment and design			1
it was the start of the acronym ( and the organization ) @entity14 , which marks its first three decades this week with a conference in @entity0			1
one speaker back in 1984 , @entity16 , the founder of @entity18 's @entity17 , predicted that devices with touch screens would come into widespread use , more than 20 years before @entity24 's @entity23 delivered on that bet			1
on wednesday , the 1,300 attendees at this year 's conference will be shown a video with clips from @entity16 's 1984 talk , along with snippets of @entity14 that predicted advances in the use of robots , development of a driverless car , and technology that enables scientists to grow human body parts			1
each of these predictions has come true , notes @entity14 's @entity42			1
one that largely has n't , at least in any practical sense , is the personal flying car , @entity42 said in an interview with @entity2			0
( one conference included a presentation on a small plane that can be driven on roads , but it has n't come into widespread use			0
) " it 's a very @entity53 concept , " she said			0
" i am waiting for that flying car			0
" @entity16 gave the first talk monday at the @entity57 conference , adding a prediction that knowledge -- the ability to speak a language or absorb @entity63 's plays -- will one day be ingested through a pill			1
he is one of many @entity14 " all - stars " invited to reappear on the conference 's stage			1
among them : " @entity80 " author @entity71 , @entity70 founder @entity69 , inventor @entity72 , robotics expert @entity73 , educator @entity74 , gen. @entity75 , @entity77 founder @entity76 , and sir @entity78 , who invented the @entity79			1
others speaking at this weeks 's conference , titled " @entity83 , " include @entity84 and @entity85 , @entity86 , author @entity87 , and former rep. @entity88 and her husband , astronaut @entity89			1
on tuesday , @entity90 , co-founder of the anti-corruption group @entity91 , will reveal the wish for which she was recently awarded the $ 1 million @entity93			0
@entity14 's breakout moment while much of this year 's conference harks back to @entity14 's start in 1984 , the organization really did n't assume its current form -- and its expansive public footprint -- until eight years ago			1
in 2006 , @entity14 's leadership decided to put its archive of recorded talks online for free			1
the thinking was that there were limits to how much impact a talk could have if its audience was only a thousand people , even if those people were influential ones			0
as @entity42 recalls , it was considered a risky and even radical move			0
" there was a lot of skepticism , " she says			0
" people worried that it might capsize our business model because we were running an expensive , somewhat elite conference			0
conventional wisdom would tell you that if you have sort of a luxury item , an expensive conference , you have to keep your prices high and your commodity scarce			0
" but @entity42 says @entity14 never got the pushback some expected from people who had paid thousands of dollars to attend the conferences			2
" they welcomed it , " she said			0
" they longed to share the talks with friends and family who could n't be there in the room			0
" and it did n't discourage people from going to @entity14 , she said			2
" we raised the price of the conference by 50 % , to $ 6,000 , and we ended up selling out a year in advance with a thousand - person wait list			2
... that really was a lesson for us in the power of openness			0
" @entity14 followed up by allowing independently organized groups around the world to hold " @entity154 " conferences , propagating its 18 - minute video format			1
@entity14 staff members can reel off the resulting numbers : 1.9 million @entity14 video views a day , 1,600 - plus @entity14 online , 9,000 @entity154 events in 157 countries			1
making of a @entity14 a @entity14 -- most of the main conferences have more than 60 of them -- is typically a carefully curated and rehearsed presentation by a thinker , an expert or an artist who 's passionate about his or her subject , which can range far beyond the original " technology , entertainment , design " boundaries			1
shot by as many as eight cameras , with professional set design and lighting , the video builds to an emotional ( and intellectual ) climax and is intended to be shared widely			0
what it is not is an hour - long college lecture , a panel discussion or a question - and - answer session with the audience -- all of which might make for a less dramatic and far less shareable product			0
some critics have argued that @entity14 reduce complex subjects to a string of bullet points or promote a naive utopian view of the infinite possibilities of technology			2
that 's not the way @entity42 sees it			0
a graduate of @entity198 , where she edited the student newspaper , she was working as a vice president at the online arm of @entity202 when she attended her first ted in 1998			0
" i absolutely fell in love with it from my first moment there			0
i felt like i had found my world and found my people			0
... i think one of the reasons it spoke to me was that @entity14 is sort of uniquely designed for people who have a wide range of interests			2
" @entity42 is a passionate advocate for conference sessions that hop from one discipline to another			0
" for me that 's what @entity14 is			1
it 's not a single talk or even a collection of talks , it 's the range of territory that we cover			2
... and if we 've curated it right , what happens to people in the audience during a @entity14 session is that you can almost feel your brain lighting up in different areas			2
so when you see a designer speak , followed by a poet , followed by a physicist , followed by an entrepreneur , followed by a great musical performance ... it helps us create connections between the ideas that are coming at us			0
" people with a wide range of interests are often cast as dilettantes or often looked down upon for what is seen as a lack of focus , " @entity42 says			0
" i see it as an existence of breadth , and one of the things you find really unites people who attend @entity14 , or people who watch @entity14 talks regularly , is that they do have a great interest in a wide range of areas			1
" " interestingly , there 's a lot of evidence that that is the kind of thinking we really need today , that the great challenges of our times can not be solved by experts working in their individual areas , but rather by people who can gather information from a wide range of fields and bring them together			2
" @entity14 's evolution the year that @entity42 first went to @entity14 was also the first time that @entity279 , a magazine entrepreneur , attended			1
and in 2001 , having sold his company , @entity279 purchased @entity14 through his nonprofit @entity281 from @entity14 co-founder @entity282			2
@entity279 begins each conference with the incantation " it 's time for @entity14 " and shares hosting the sessions with @entity42 and other staff members			1
@entity42 helps curate the conference and also oversees @entity14 's media arm , which includes a recently relaunched @entity14			1
she sees the arc of @entity14 's lifespan as going from a " closed conference to an open platform for spreading ideas			1
" indeed the organization 's motto is " ideas worth spreading , " and the new website makes that tangible			2
a widget on each video allows a user who has shared a talk with others to see how many views the talk has gotten from those who have clicked on that person 's link			0
through the site , @entity14 speakers can provide suggestions for further reading and for ways to take action on the issues raised in their talks			1
the boom in online video still , the heart of what @entity14 offers is the short , tightly edited online video itself , and @entity42 acknowledges that what was once unique to the organization has become available elsewhere			1
" over the years , the format of a recorded talk has gone from a novelty to a bit more of a staple online			2
i think that 's great news for everyone			0
" as for the criticism @entity14 has gotten , @entity42 says , " the more people you 're influencing , the bigger target you 'll become			2
it 's a natural part of growing up as a media organization			1
" " we work very concertedly with all of our speakers to make sure that their talks are deeply substantive and authentic			2
so there 's no formula for a great @entity14 talk			1
... we always make it very clear to our speakers that it is essential that they not dumb down their material			0
" @entity42 says the aim is to have the audience " stretch up , " and to help make that possible , she cites the advice often attributed to @entity351 : " make things as simple as possible but no simpler			0
" and , she adds , " it 's important to remember what a @entity14 is			1
a @entity14 is n't a scientific paper and it is n't a full - length book			1
it 's a short talk meant to reach an intelligent general audience			0

@entity14 got its start as a conference in @entity5 , @entity6 , 30 years ago
today the organization has a big media footprint , with 1,600 - plus talks available online
many predictions made on its stage have come true , including *popularity* of touch screens
speakers at this week 's conference include @entity377 , @entity86 , and @entity78
