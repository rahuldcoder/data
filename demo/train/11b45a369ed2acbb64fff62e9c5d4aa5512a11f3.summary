@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 tv channels could advertise abortion services for the first time under new advertising rules proposed thursday by an ad industry group			1
the new proposals will also allow condoms to be advertised more widely on television			2
the @entity12 , the industry body responsible for writing and enforcing advertising rules in @entity4 , said the commercials would be for pregnancy advisory services that give information about a range of options to pregnant women , including abortion			1
if an organization does not offer information about abortion , it would have to make that clear in the ad , @entity12 spokeswoman @entity20 said			1
abortion clinics , which require referrals from doctors or hospitals , would not be allowed to advertise under the proposed rules , @entity20 said			1
there would be no restrictions on when such ads could air on @entity4 television , she said , but programmers would have to keep the sensitive topic in mind and not schedule the ads around religious programs , for example			1
" it 's a sensitive product , so it would have to be scheduled sensitively , " @entity20 told @entity2			0
the proposal is among a number of updates to current advertising standards that the @entity46 and @entity12 , its broadcasting arm , published thursday after an 18 - month review			0
" each year the @entity4 public ( sees ) millions of advertisements , many of which are memorable , " the committee said			1
" the advertising codes aim to make sure that they are memorable for the right reasons			0
" the public now has until june 19 to comment on the proposals before they come into force , likely in 2010 , the committee said			2
the new proposals also contain a change on advertising condoms on television			2
under current rules , condoms generally can not be advertised on tv before 9 p.m. in order to protect younger viewers , the committee said			0
new rules would relax the restrictions on advertising condoms , with the only requirement that they not be shown around programs intended for children younger than 10			0
the change came after @entity78 , a member of the @entity79 , requested the change and noted that @entity4 had the highest teenage pregnancy rate in @entity82 along with spiraling rates of sexually transmitted diseases , the committee said			1
@entity78 reported a survey that showed young people believed tv was one of the most effective ways of encouraging them to use condoms			0
" the presence of condom advertisements on television continues to be a subject of complaint to the ( @entity97 ) , but numbers are very low , " the committee said			0
" nevertheless , @entity12 has to balance public sensitivities against a public health problem that is clearly urgent			0
