-- as @entity1 continues to rise as lead survivor -- and decision - maker -- in the @entity6 's economic mire , the @entity4 would do well to take a lesson from the country 's economic model , particularly in manufacturing			1
losing 4 million jobs over the past 10 years , @entity4 manufacturing has hovered at roughly 12 % of @entity4 's gdp , less than half its percentage in the 1950s			1
in @entity1 , however , manufacturing is well on its way toward 25 % of gdp			1
president @entity18 's pledge this week to lower manufacturing sector taxes to 25 % , and january 's @entity4 manufacturing growth numbers , the highest in seven months , will certainly help stem the tide			1
but , clearly , a word to the wise is in order			0
with @entity4 experiencing the highest income inequality since the @entity26 , a gap that mushroomed primarily in the past 30 to 40 years because of trade , tax and labor policies , the answer is in our workers			1
consider @entity4 trade policies , which undermined @entity4 's working class through the outsourcing and offshoring of @entity4 manufacturing and the erosion of labor protections			1
consider its tax policies , which moved wealth from the majority to the minority , thanks to tax loopholes such as low capital gains and dividends taxes , thus favoring nonlabor wealth creation			0
consider its labor policies , which failed to increase minimum wages for the majority of @entity4 : minimum wage is worth less now -- adjusted for inflation -- than it was in 1968 when the inequality trend started to take off			0
opinion : nostalgia for factory jobs that will never come back the way @entity4 has treated its workers has helped to create a highly precarious socioeconomic reality : one out of every two @entity4 is in poverty or low - income			1
according to the @entity63 , roughly 50 million @entity4 are living below the poverty level and surviving on an average annual income of less than $ 22,500 for a family of four			0
another 100 million @entity4 are living in the low - income bracket , living on average annual income of less than $ 45,000 for a family of four -- hardly the @entity4 dream			2
couple these trends with the devastating financial crisis , which hurt those whose wealth was in basic stocks and first - time home purchases -- as opposed to the wealthy who invested in insurance - backed securities , derivatives and credit default swaps -- and you 've bottomed out @entity4 's working class			2
this is where the @entity4 can learn from @entity1			2
how @entity1 stayed economically healthy , while maintaining a strong working class , might offer a lesson or two for @entity4 's woes			2
unlike the @entity4 , @entity1 recovered quickly from the economic slump in 2009 , mainly because @entity1 industry managed to keep its skilled work force during the crisis			1
this was possible because the @entity1 government sponsored short - time work , or a reduction of working hours , thus avoiding layoffs			2
this measure was possible only where decent wages and management - union trust existed , what @entity1 call a " social partnership "			2
even now , despite some growth in nonunionized companies and income inequality , the export - oriented manufacturing model of social partnership is strong			0
those who believe unions , high wages and workers rights are a burden for business should consider that this sector has been @entity1 's most successful			1
exports , mainly manufacturing , grew by 2.3 % ( even with 2009 data included ) , higher than the average growth rate of the @entity1 economy over the past 10 years at 1.1 %			1
here 's how they did it : instead of trying to outcompete global markets in cheap goods , @entity1 industry specialized in high - quality products and kept its share in a growing global market , as other @entity128 countries , @entity129 and the @entity4 lost shares to @entity131			1
the @entity1 manufacturing strategy is based on making existing products better again and again , or as a @entity135 ad put it : " we are inventing the car			0
" this strategy is possible only with highly skilled and highly motivated workers and requires managers who promote a constant evolution of improvement in products and processes			0
this change - oriented management is successful because strong union representation on the shop floor , in the form of " work councils , " and on supervisory boards ensures that workers ' interests are always considered			0
in the face of global competition , @entity1 manufacturing workers ' representation remains strong			0
it has proved to be successful because it has incorporated the knowledge of workers and their representatives , countering change with fewer conflicts			0
contrast this with @entity1 's services sector , where wages are much lower and the power of unions is much weaker			1
growth , not coincidentally , is much weaker , too			0
politicians across the @entity170 , but particularly in @entity171 , would be well - advised to take a look at the @entity1 manufacturing sector			1
the @entity4 is only facing increasing global competition			0
if @entity4 wants an economic tide that lifts all boats , the answer is in its workers			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

@entity4 manufacturing lost 4 million jobs over past 10 years , *accounts* for only 12 % of gdp
writers : @entity1 recovered quickly from the economic crisis by keeping its skilled work force
@entity1 industry is 25 % of its gdp , they write , and *focuses* on high - quality goods
writers : @entity1 industry has unions , offers high wages and is its most successful sector
