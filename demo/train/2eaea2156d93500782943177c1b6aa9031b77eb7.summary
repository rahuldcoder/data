@entity0 , @entity1 -- with the hotel front desk clerk busy checking me in , her co-worker picked up the ringing phone			1
" do we have any foreign journalists staying here ? " she repeated the question being asked at the other end of the phone			0
" no , " she replied , before the clerk helping me threw her a look			0
" oh yes , three just got here			0
" with the local authorities now presumably alerted to our presence , any hope we had of maintaining a low profile at the start of our reporting trip to cover the most anticipated trial in @entity1 in recent memory had ended			2
we arrived in the eastern city of @entity0 on tuesday , two days before the local @entity23 was set to try disgraced @entity25 leader @entity24 , who was once tipped to be a future president but now faces charges of bribe - taking , embezzlement and abuse of power			1
@entity24 's spectacular downfall -- complete with tales of murder , corruption and betrayal -- triggered the greatest political crisis for the ruling @entity36 in decades			1
during his trial , the charismatic and controversial politician is expected to make his first public appearance since april 2012 when he was stripped of his top party posts			1
timeline : the @entity24 scandal given the high drama and political stakes , it seems prudent for @entity1 's top leaders to pick one of the country 's blandest cities for the spectacle			1
@entity0 is far away -- more than 780 miles ( 1,200 kilometers ) -- from @entity51 , @entity24 's former powerbase , or other places where he had held senior positions			1
the presiding judge is said to be a tested and reliable official in the eyes of @entity58			0
coincidentally , @entity60 province -- with @entity0 being the capital -- is also home to the ancient sage @entity64 , whose philosophy emphasizes respect to authority -- an idea that nervous local officials probably wish " unruly " foreign journalists would learn quickly			1
the courthouse sits at the end of a narrow , tree - lined downtown street , surrounded by high - rise apartment buildings			2
all looked normal and quiet as we exited the car , if not for the dozen soldiers unloading plastic barriers from trucks across the street from the court 's main gate			2
a press pen was in the making			0
while our cameraman tested satellite signal strength for potential live shot locations , an official directed us to a nearby hotel , where the government had set up a media center			2
after going through a metal detector and a hand - wand inspection , we entered the building and reached the first position in what seemed to be an assembly line for the credential application process -- involving passport check , form distribution , information verification , data entry and photo - taking			1
five steps later , we were told our press cards would be ready the following afternoon			0
but officials there did n't seem to know much else about the " open " trial -- questions about likely courtroom access , live broadcast opportunities or press conferences went unanswered			2
almost as soon as the trial date was set last weekend , we had been calling the court trying to apply for a spot inside the courtroom -- only to be kicked around by different departments			1
as night fell tuesday , we started live broadcast near a side entrance to the court			0
a notice posted in the bulletin board by the gate announced @entity24 's trial information			1
pedestrians stopped to snap photos of the notice with their phones			0
meanwhile , i received a text message from human rights activist @entity129 , elder brother of the blind lawyer @entity131 , who had intended to " witness " the trial			0
he said , after he got off the train , state security agents awaiting him at @entity0 's west railway station forced him to return to his home village some 125 miles ( 200 kilometers ) away			1
@entity138 , another prominent rights advocate , tweeted that the authorities in @entity0 had tightened their grip over all activists ahead of the trial			2
the day before the trial brought a new excitement and a degree of chaos to the courthouse 's doorstep			0
despite a heavy police presence , some @entity24 admirers -- he retains considerable support in @entity51 and elsewhere in @entity1 -- showed up in the morning , along with onlookers and petitioners with various grievances -- all eager to take the rare opportunity to share their stories and opinions with the gathering foreign reporters			1
" during chairman @entity169 's time , everyone was equal and we had no corruption -- ' singing red and smashing black ' was achieving that and benefited people , " declared a 66 - year - old local resident who only identified herself as ms. @entity162 , as she referred to @entity24 's famous campaign to revive @entity165 ideology and crack down on crimes			1
" he 's not a god or perfect , but the masses supported him , " she added			0
" they ca n't just condemn him to hell -- i want him to have a fair trial			0
" " why bother ? " scoffed 62 - year - old retired worker , named mr. @entity180 , who stood next to her			0
" @entity24 's a victim of political struggles			1
" " you think he actually believed in this ' singing red and smashing black ' stuff ? it was all for appearance 's sake , " he continued and turned sarcastic			2
" we ordinary people should just feel happy to be fed and clothed , and watch whatever news they put on tv			0
" as the crowd grew larger and louder , the police decided to intervene , shooing off the speakers for disrupting traffic and ordering reporters to stay inside the designated media zone across the street			0
but an elderly petitioner 's cry for help briefly caused new commotion			0
wearing a paper headband with the character " wronged " written on it , the woman kept yelling at policemen who were dragging her away in front of news cameras : " i 'm 80 years old and have a heart condition -- stop pushing me ! " the atmosphere among the assembled press was just as excitable -- at one point a number of reporters rushed to the city 's west railway station as a rumor circulated that a train carrying @entity24 would be arriving			1
by late afternoon , a legion of newly accredited journalists -- almost all from overseas media as most domestic outlets are barred from covering politically sensitive events -- had settled in			0
some journalists questioned whether a day spent running around in the summer heat to cover a trial where the outcome is all but certain was really worth it			0
the conviction rate for first - and second - instance criminal trials in @entity1 -- where the party controls the police , prosecution and courts -- stood at 99.9 % in 2010 , a @entity230 report cited the @entity237 as saying			2
the only " unknown " in the @entity24 case seems to be the sentencing			2
after a long day of stakeout and live reports , we finally headed back to the hotel two blocks away from the court			0
as we walked into the @entity247 , part of a sprawling mixed - use development , i was reminded by the sign that the hotel 's @entity1 name is @entity253 -- a nod to the property 's owner , the @entity258 - based @entity257			1
the real estate conglomerate -- headed by @entity1 's richest man -- saw its business take off in the 1990s , propelled by land deals with the local government when @entity24 was mayor of the coastal city in northeastern @entity1			1
@entity265 is not implicated in the @entity24 case , but it seems -- despite the top leaders ' best efforts to choose a " neutral " location for the trial -- @entity24 's shadow looms large even in @entity0 .			1

@entity24 set to be tried at the local @entity23 in @entity0
former political star faces charges of bribe - taking , embezzlement and abuse of power
@entity0 is far away -- more than 780 miles -- from @entity51 , @entity24 's former powerbase
it will be @entity24 's first public appearance since april 2012 when he was stripped of his posts
