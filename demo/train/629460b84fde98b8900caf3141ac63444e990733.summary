-- i have a dog			0
a dog who , as i write this , is curled up quietly on the sofa , probably dreaming about dog things : chasing squirrels			0
his fake doggy girlfriend in @entity12 whom he 's never actually met			1
and , just like every other night , before we go to bed , i 'll open up the back door so he can prance out into the yard to drop a toaster - sized stinker on my lawn			1
which i 'll promptly pick up some time next month			0
this entire routine required a learning curve that took all of about a week when he was just a puppy			0
but some of my friends have kids			1
kids who , as i write this , are likely not curled up quietly on the sofa , dreaming about kid things			1
because they 're wildly romping around the living room , pooping in their pants			2
and , at least to me , this constant cleaning and changing of said pants seems far more gross and burdensome than occasionally stepping outside with a @entity38 grocery bag firmly wrapped around my hand			0
there 's no right answer here			2
i 'm just a little unnecessarily kid - phobic			2
they 're expensive , they tell boring stories , and most of them require guidance and understanding			2
@entity49 just wants a rawhide			0
but , back to my original point , training my dog to go outside only took a matter of days			2
whereas teaching children to properly use the bathroom literally takes years ! however , there 's a new product soon to be on the market that might just make the baby - vs. - toilet experience a little easier , if not completely ridiculous			1
it 's called the @entity61			1
because , if there 's one alphabet letter that needs to be prison - shanked and dropped into a shallow grave it 's the lowercase i. that , and the capital r. do n't ask			1
for $ 40 you get a fairly normal - looking , plastic , child - sized toilet with a removable bowl			2
which is great for potlucks			0
but the @entity61 also has an adjustable stand specifically made for mounting an @entity75 so your child can play games and watch videos while learning to make @entity80			1
the creator of this product , @entity83 , recently debuted the @entity61 at the @entity84 in @entity85 , and it 's become a popular story on several different websites , primarily because we now have a strong candidate for the most reckless idea ever			1
but never mind the fact that most people probably do n't want their @entity75 within 30 feet of a child , much less one who 's learning to drop a deuce			1
kids probably do n't need this much stimulation			2
mind you , i do			0
but i 'm an adult			2
and it 's gon na be a while			0
alas , the primary goal of mounting an @entity75 within the @entity61 is simply to get your kid to actually spend more time on the toilet learning how to properly go			1
and , perhaps to some parents , if utilizing technology works , so be it			0
the ends justify the means			0
all hail the @entity61 ! still , what if this ultimately leads to some weird social conditioning where , even as the child gets older , he simply ca n't do his business without having expensive electronics right there in front of him -- a serious mental crutch			1
sort of like @entity123 's character , @entity122 , from " @entity124 , " who , after being released from prison , famously could n't " squeeze a drop " without asking permission			0
with the @entity61 , a kid gets socially conditioned to hold something shiny with a lithium battery to go to the bathroom			1
which could some day turn ugly			0
" damn , @entity134 , have you gained weight ? " " i lost my @entity137			1
" other critics of the @entity61 have argued that toilet training is an important bonding moment between a parent and his or her child -- that introducing games and movies diminishes the experience			1
i 'd argue feces diminishes the experience			0
but if you want to blame " @entity151 , " go right ahead			0
all in all , it 's just sort of a silly idea , bribing children to use the toilet with the promise of touchscreen entertainment , perpetuating this need for visual stimulation literally all the time			1
but , on the other hand , we all do it			0
whether it 's an iphone at work or a copy of @entity167 at home , let he who is without a magazine in his bathroom cast the first stone			1
i honestly do n't care			0
and @entity49 just wants a rawhide .			0

the @entity61 lets kids entertain themselves on an @entity75 during potty training
@entity179 *wonders* : is this product a little short - *sighted* ?
@entity179 : what if , when you 're an adult , you lose your @entity137 ? can you still go ?
it 's a silly idea , but then again , look at your bathroom *diversions* now , he says
