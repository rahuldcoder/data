-- @entity2 's much - awaited military offensive in @entity3 was launched more than a week ago , and followed an attack on @entity6 airport that left at least 36 people dead			1
due to the strategic calculations of the @entity2 state , @entity3 has steadily fallen into the hands of motley militant networks , and has become a mountainous zone for the @entity2 @entity13 to recruit , regroup and launch attacks against the country			1
the @entity16 conducted a similar operation in the @entity18 in 2009 , not too far from the tribal areas , that has been a relative success in reclaiming territory			1
it is unclear which direction the latest operation will go			0
but a major humanitarian crisis is brewing in the wake of the new offensive			1
as of wednesday , the government had registered over 450,000 internally displaced people ( @entity31 ) who have been fleeing the area in view of the aerial bombardments and warnings by military authorities			1
there are fears the figures could be much higher			0
desperate need for shelter the military has taken extraordinary steps , especially in terms of its public relations efforts , to minimize the fallout in public perception			0
it 's issuing press releases , specifying how many terrorists have been killed , and giving a count of aid distributed			0
yet , thousands of families still need immediate support in terms of livelihood , shelter and basic amenities			2
while the @entity60 has stepped in to provide aid , distribution systems have a long way to go in meeting the scale of demand			0
beyond @entity3 , the @entity66 population follows the age - old custom of accepting and looking after " guests			1
" predictably , many families fleeing the violence are being absorbed into the towns and villages of @entity73 , in neighboring @entity74 ( @entity74 ) province			1
@entity73 town is straining under the pressure of a massive population influx			1
while local @entity66 and civic groups have been engaged , the response of the government authorities has been slow			1
the disaster management authority ( @entity83 ) in the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) , underfunded like most government agencies , is battling with the magnitude of the crisis			1
government response the government has established one camp in @entity73 , but many more facilities are needed , especially during the hot summer season			1
a meager grant is being offered to each family for their multifarious needs , but very few have received it so far			0
the political opposition that rules @entity74 has complained of a funds shortage , and voices in the media have criticized the federal government 's inordinate focus on domestic political squabbles and high profile infrastructure projects , ignoring the plight of homeless people			1
the minister in charge of the government response â € ” the federal minister for states and @entity112 retired lt gen @entity113 -- has said " every reasonable need of the @entity31 will be taken care of in the best possible manner and money is not an issue			2
" however , he also urged fellow @entity2 to " open their pockets			1
" few places to go @entity2 's ethnic politics also impedes free movement of @entity31			2
while the country 's constitution allows for freedom of movement for its citizens , the provincial governments of @entity125 and @entity126 have restricted the inflow of migrants from the north			0
the provincial government of @entity125 says that it is already dealing with two million " aliens " and has attributed the rise of militancy in the port city @entity6 due to earlier in - country migrations			2
similarly , @entity126 , the home province of @entity2 's prime minister , has refused to host the displaced people			1
this policy has been termed illegal by political leaders and has caused resentment not just among the @entity31 but @entity2 's @entity66 population in general			2
marginalized population the people of @entity3 -- and the tribal region @entity84 -- have been stranded between the military and the militants for more than a decade			1
they have dealt with historic marginalization , underdevelopment , high poverty levels and , of late , the polio epidemic			0
an estimated 160,000 children are vulnerable since the @entity13 banned immunization in @entity3 two years ago , terming immunization as a " western conspiracy			1
" a major worry nationally is that the polio virus may spread faster than it has in recent months			0
according to government officials , @entity2 has reported 65 polio cases from @entity84 this year of which 50 alone pertained to @entity3			1
challenge and opportunities these grave challenges require leadership and effective interagency coordination			0
@entity2 's prime minister @entity169 has set up a high level body that monitors the day - to - day situation			2
but , it is the local authorities that need more funds and broader mandates			0
the risks of aggravating the already marginalized people are manifold			2
increased radicalization is one since the area is an open field for charities affiliated with extremist organizations			0
there are opportunities as well			0
free of @entity13 diktat , there is a greater scope for immunization campaigns for the children now			2
there is also an opportunity to rebuild @entity84 , which has been governed since the @entity192 times as a remote outpost of the empire with little or no rights for the local population			0
earlier reform efforts led nowhere			0
political and administrative reforms must follow the military operations			0
local governments and courts are needed for the area			0
@entity2 's tribal belt has to evolve from its current status as a " strategic , " semi-colonial arena to a democratic polity			2
this requires a civil - military consensus			0
for now , the country must tackle the growing numbers of homeless and avoid another catastrophe in the making			0
fleeing @entity2 crowd border towns , asking ' why were n't we warned ? '			1
