-- teams in @entity3 are trying to track down anyone who came into contact with patients infected with the ebola virus , which has killed at least 14 people there this month , authorities said monday			1
" this is very , very important , to trace every contact and to watch them for an incubation period of 21 days , " @entity11 spokesman @entity10 said			1
the teams -- consisting of officials from @entity3 's ministry of health , the @entity17 @entity16 and the @entity11 -- are part of an aggressive approach to try to stamp out the outbreak of the highly infectious virus			1
@entity3 president @entity25 spoke on state and private television sunday urging his countrymen to be cautious			1
" i therefore appeal to you to be vigilant			0
avoid shaking of hands ; do not take on burying somebody that has died from symptoms which look like @entity34			1
instead , call the health workers to be the ones to do it			0
and avoid promiscuity because these sicknesses can also go through sex , " he said			0
this month 's outbreak in western @entity3 initially went undetected because patients did not show typical symptoms , health minister dr. @entity42 told @entity0 on sunday			1
patients had fevers and were vomiting , but did not show other typical symptoms , such as hemorrhaging			2
the ebola virus is a highly infectious , often fatal agent spread through direct contact with bodily fluids			1
symptoms can include fever , vomiting , diarrhea , abdominal pain , headache , a measles - like rash , red eyes and , at times , bleeding from body openings			0
but diagnosis in an individual who has only recently been infected can be difficult since early symptoms , such as red eyes and skin rash , are seen more frequently in patients who have more common diseases , according to the @entity16			2
@entity3 's @entity72 declared the outbreak in @entity75 district saturday after getting confirmatory results from the @entity77 identifying the disease as ebola hemorrhagic fever , @entity81 strain			1
the fatality rate for those infected with that strain is about 65 % , @entity10 said			0
" one can recover , but there 's no medicine that can help one recover , so you just have to pray that your own body is strong enough , " he said			0
patients with symptoms of @entity34 infection had been reported early in the month in @entity75 district			1
some people delayed seeking treatment , in part , because they believed that " evil spirits " had sickened them , according to a report from district health authorities			2
" this caused civil strife among the community , requiring police intervention to quell the animosity , " the @entity97 said			0
an emergency team of 100 volunteers was undergoing training monday to help spread the word in vulnerable communities about the disease and its transmission , the @entity3 @entity103 said in a statement			1
@entity112 , also known as @entity112 , was helping set up an isolation center at @entity75 's hospital			0
national health authorities say that in addition to the 14 deaths , at least six other people have been infected			1
nine of the deaths were from a single household in the village of @entity123 , according to @entity11			2
a medic who had treated other victims is among the dead , @entity42 said			0
officials were trying to determine the extent of the outbreak , @entity16 spokesman @entity127 said sunday			0
the @entity132 - based organization was sending about five people to join @entity16 staffers permanently based in @entity3 , he said			1
" these outbreaks have a tendency to stamp themselves out , if you will , if we can get in and ... stop the chain of transmission , " he said			0
in @entity75 , a national task force has been mobilized in an effort to stem the outbreak			0
as of monday , two people with the virus remained hospitalized in stable condition , said @entity11			1
one was a 38 - year - old woman who had attended to her sister , the medic who died , and the other was a 30 - year - old woman who had helped bury another victim			0
though both patients had symptoms that included fever , vomiting , diarrhea and abdominal pain , neither had shown signs of hemorrhaging , the ministry said sunday			2
one patient suspected of being infected with the virus ran away from a hospital sunday morning , but was tracked to her home and returned to the hospital in @entity75 , @entity166 , a spokeswoman for the @entity3 @entity103 in @entity168 , told @entity0 in a telephone interview			1
" the concern is where she could have gone to when she ran away , " she said			0
health officials urged the public to report any suspected cases , to avoid contact with anyone infected and to wear gloves and masks while disinfecting bedding and clothing of infected people			2
officials also advised avoiding public gatherings in the affected district			0
the @entity11 did not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to @entity3 because of the outbreak			1
the @entity17 @entity189 in @entity168 issued an emergency message for @entity17 citizens that said the outbreak appeared to be centered in @entity193 , @entity75 district , although one suspected victim is reported to have traveled to @entity168 for treatment at @entity196 , where he died on july 22			0
it urged avoiding contact with dead animals , especially primates , and refraining from eating " bushmeat			2
