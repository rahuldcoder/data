-- word on the cobblestone street is @entity3 is the " new @entity4			1
the landscape of this northern part of @entity8 is less cultivated			1
and , last i checked , the @entity10 did n't happen here			2
plus , " @entity3 " is still a little - known proper noun and " @entity4 " has moved into adjective territory			1
show me an @entity14 suburb and i 'll show you a " @entity4 " kitchen , if not an entire foreclosed development named " @entity18			1
" earlier this year when @entity20 -- the strip mall home of endless breadsticks -- wanted to make itself more appealing , it announced it was making over its restaurants in the style of @entity4 farmhouses			1
now , i do n't know if they serve shark in @entity4 , but the region has certainly jumped it			1
that 's not going to happen to @entity3 anytime soon			1
no , it will continue to hide in plain sight			0
right in the middle of @entity35			0
a small peninsula the shape of a crudely drawn heart tucked behind the boot of @entity40			1
capped by the @entity41 , bottom dangling in the cartoon blue of the @entity43			0
eventually the tour buses and cookbook authors will arrive en masse , but for now the region is so sparsely populated that sometimes with its raw grandeur and new highways it can feel like an imaginary world in a video game where you build your own civilization			2
turns out civilization has existed in @entity3 since at least the @entity54 , when people lived in " gradines , " fortified castles built on the tops of hills			2
houses and walls from that time are still visible as are the many structures left behind by all those who have ruled this region : the @entity65 , the @entity66 , the @entity67 , the @entity68			2
you name them , and they probably killed people and built churches here			0
the @entity40 controlled the area until 1947 when it was ceded to then - @entity73 after the @entity74 now it is part of @entity8			1
for the modern invader , @entity3 comes in two flavors : coastal paradise and rustic hilltop hamlet			2
because the region is only about 50 miles wide and 60 miles north to south you can have both in the same day			2
the coast is necklaced with tourist towns and fishing villages			0
from glamorous @entity84 , a 19th century playground for @entity68 nobility , to @entity87 , a gritty port town with an ace up its sleeve : a stunning @entity66 amphitheater built between 27 b.c. and 68 @entity91 ( once used for gladiator fights , the arena is still used for , depending on your point of view , less menacing entertainment from the likes of @entity98 and @entity99			0
) but the most beautiful coastal town in @entity3 , and possibly all of @entity8 , is @entity101			1
a perennial contender for the best - place - to - watch - a - sunset , @entity101 is a stunner of pastel homes , polished stones and blue water			0
the town flag could very well be one of the bathing suits or dish towels that charmingly flap along the laundry lines strung throughout this picturesque but lived - in little peninsula off a peninsula			0
@entity101 feels very @entity40 ( it has been described as " a bit of @entity118 spilled on a hill " ) right down to the fashionably dressed women accompanied by tidy men in leather loafers and colorful sweaters hugging their necks			2
the town 's narrow alleyways and courtyards house several great restaurants and numerous places to have a drink while the sun disappears			0
day and night it 's the ideal venue to run the @entity134 triathlon : swim , eat and lounge at a cafe			0
but that 's not my favorite part of @entity3			1
and it 's not the part that people are thinking of when they label this area the " new @entity4			1
" they are referring to the heart of the heart - shaped peninsula			0
the verdant interior filled with surprises like mistletoe brandy , hilltop hamlets and @entity152 , the smallest town in the world			0
although the air is perfumed by the nearby sea , inland @entity3 is a world away from the coast 's busy beaches and ice cream stands			1
take any exit off the highway and you 'll find one tiny village after another , each with its own shambolic charm and unique architectural legacy			0
ever since the @entity66 ripped out cypresses and replaced them with olive groves , this area has been renowned for its cuisine			0
@entity173 called @entity3 olive oil the second best in the world ( after @entity40 olive oil , of course ) and contemporary foodies geek out over the area 's distinguished grape varietals and artisanal hams and cheeses			1
@entity3 's forests are filled with game , but the most hunted creature in the region is the truffle -- a noble fungus immune to cultivation that fetches up to $ 2,000 a pound			1
they come in black and white ( the latter is more prized ) and they come on top of steak , shaved on pasta , drowned in olive oil and blended with rice			0
a well - prepared local lunch here rivals any meal in @entity35			0
recently i was enjoying one of those meals in the mesmerizing town of @entity206 , a medieval hamlet on a hill that 's home to 30 galleries and a summer jazz school that bestows an intermittent bebop soundtrack to the ancient landscape			0
as i sat in the shaded stone courtyard taking in the soft breeze and lazily scraping up the last bits of lunch from my plate , it occurred to me that this must have been what @entity4 was like before the @entity222 movies , the cookbooks and the hordes of tourists : @entity4 when it was still under - the - radar and affordable			2
before the @entity20 had ever laid eyes on it			0
" no , @entity3 is not the new @entity4 , " i thought			1
" it 's the old @entity4			1

@entity8 's @entity3 peninsula *inspires* *comparisons* with @entity40 's @entity4 region
while there are *similarities* , this *pocket* of @entity8 has n't suffered a tourism crush
its villages are less cultivated , less wealthy and *delightfully* *unspoiled*
