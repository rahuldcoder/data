-- carefully constructed looks that borrow from another time are all the rage on the streets of @entity5 and @entity6			1
but with vintage and thrift clothing stores popping up on every corner , the vintage look of the @entity8 almost ca n't be helped			1
since 2006 , @entity13 blogger @entity12 has been documenting the evolving street style in her hometown			1
she has watched the neighboring cities shed a @entity18 style and celebrate the rise of local designers			1
after moving back to @entity6 once she finished college in @entity24 , @entity21 found her style evolving as well			1
" the blog was really bare bones at first , " @entity21 said			2
" i had a point - and - shoot camera , and took photos of everything			0
i think i 'm a little more edited now			0
i have a grasp of my own personal style			2
dressing up in @entity33 " there 's a difference between 25 and 31 , as well , " @entity21 said with a laugh , referring to her age			2
the individualism in the @entity8 challenges @entity21 to capture as much of it as she can			1
feminine lace and crochet meet up with menswear and masculine footwear to create a mash - up of different styles			0
" we are a really interesting , creative city , " @entity21 said			2
" i do n't think a lot of people know that			0
" below , @entity21 describes the basis for @entity8 style			1
@entity0 : what was the 2006 fashion scene in @entity6 like when you started the blog ? @entity21 : i had noticed around that time the local fashion scene was picking up -- a lot of local designers and more fashion shows popping up			1
people thought more about what they were wearing			0
they were evolving from a @entity18 aesthetic to more of a regular fashion aesthetic			2
colorful layers of style on @entity71 's streets we kept that grassroots feeling at the base of how we evolved , but now it 's kind of a hodge - podge			1
@entity0 : how would you compare the style now ? @entity21 : i think people are really budget - conscious here , so thrifting is big			2
there are so many styles , but it 's largely ' budget - friendly creative '			1
we 're just getting to be more open to paying high - fashion prices , but it 's a little hard for a lot of people here to get their minds around it			2
but they 're creative , and always carry a retro element			2
we do have a big hipster contingent in the city , so that affects the style			0
the high - waist / accentuated waist has been very popular and it goes back to the retro feel of @entity6			2
when you have a lot of people thrifting , you 're going to end up having clothes from another time			0
@entity0 : is the local designer scene still alive and well ? @entity21 : i just found out one of our local designers is going to be on @entity110			1
we 've had five people from the city in @entity110			0
we also have a big fashion show each spring called @entity114			0
it 's a runway show mixed with a rock concert			0
and then we have @entity117 , a collective support group for local designers			1
i know they want to start sewing cooperatives , where designers help each other sew their collections			0
there is a huge support network for local designers here			1
get smart : @entity127 street style @entity0 : who are some of the favorite local designers and where do the style - inclined shop ? @entity21 : @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 are a handful of designers			1
you can find some of their designs at @entity142			0
as far as thrift stores , rewind , @entity143 and @entity145 's @entity144 are all popular			1
they kind of pop up all over			0
all of the sudden , you 're going down the street and then there 's another vintage store			1
@entity0 : what are you looking for when you scout street style ? @entity21 : someone catches my eye first			1
i get a better overall , thoughtful look at them and decide if it hits me more in my brain and not just my eye , then i approach them			0
my personal style tends towards kind of boyish , almost menswear - inspired			0
that always catches my eye , but also outfits where a lot of pieces come together			0
but at the same time , i 'm developing an appreciation for seeing the beauty in one simple dress			0
