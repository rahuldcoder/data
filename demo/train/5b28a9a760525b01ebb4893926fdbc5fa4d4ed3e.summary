-- comic book fans are n't the only ones expected to assemble in theaters friday			0
judging by its early international box office take , " @entity11 " -- the superhero equivalent of a musical supergroup -- should blow away the competition , kicking off the summer movie season as a hit with a wide spectrum of moviegoers			1
early tracking estimates see it as possibly beating " @entity16 's " then - record opening weekend from 2008 , which " @entity17 and the @entity18 " overtook last summer			0
not to be outdone , the final chapter in the @entity22 trilogy , " @entity20 , " also has high expectations of its own to meet on july 20			1
( " rises " is from @entity24 , and the @entity22 character is part of @entity27			1
they are both owned by @entity28 , also @entity0 's parent company			0
) compared with these two superheroes , " @entity32 " is practically ancient history			0
it too set a box - office record in 2007 for biggest opening weekend			1
@entity35 hopes to recapture some of that magic with the release of " @entity39 " reboot on july 3 , a holiday weekend			1
the upcoming trio of films is a far cry from recent years when movies such as " @entity44 " and " @entity45 " took a chance by introducing lesser - known superheroes on the big screen with very different results			1
this summer the question is not , " will superhero movies be big , " but " how big will they be ? " you can hardly ask for safer bets than @entity54 , @entity22 and a powerhouse superhero team			1
so will this be the moment that superhero movies reach their peak of popularity ? " this summer will blow 2008 ( the year of ' @entity44 ' and ' @entity16 ' ) out of the water , " predicted @entity59 of @entity22 - on - film.com			1
" it might have it beat , ( even ) if only ' rises ' was being released			0
" author and professor @entity65 , speaking from the viewpoint of the fan of " @entity11 " ( he runs @entity64 ) , agrees			0
" there 's no doubt that with so many epic franchises all rolling out this year , guys in capes -- and webs -- will be hauling in a lot of loot at the box office			1
no wonder @entity77 wisely held off till next year			0
" at the same time , each of these movies faces the challenge of potentially not living up to expectations			0
" at this point , my only fear is that the hype ( around ' @entity11 ' ) will prove to be too much , and people 's expectations will rise too far for the movie to possibly meet them , no matter how good it is , " @entity65 said			0
@entity89 of @entity90 said : " ' @entity11 ' has that challenge of going beyond the superhero crowd and to a more mainstream action crowd , but it seems to me that they have successfully done that			0
excitement seems to be there among all groups and around the world			0
i see ' @entity11 ' breaking the $ 1 billion mark at the worldwide box office			2
" as for " rises , " @entity59 voiced one simple fact of life when it comes to movie franchises : " how many third films in a series have been good ? " ( even so , he said he thinks the new @entity22 movie has the potential to be better than the last one , which is often credited for the expansion of the @entity114 ' best picture category to 10 films			2
) " ' @entity20 ' will have to enter the marketplace without the @entity122 factor , " @entity116 said , referring to the star 's death before the release of " @entity16			0
" " however , the last film was so well - loved that the new film will benefit from those coattails			2
" if anything , the " @entity39 " reboot , with its new cast and creative team , including @entity129 in the title role , seems to have the most challenges of them all			1
" it 's only been five years since the previous trilogy ended , but if they make a solid film , then people will come and the movie could last , " @entity89 said			0
@entity65 added , " ' @entity39 ' must hit a home run , to justify the series reboot so very soon after the previous trio of @entity54 films			2
" not that @entity35 is sweating it too much : it has already hired hotshot screenwriters @entity145 and @entity147 to pen a new @entity54 sequel			0
one does n't have to be a genius to guess that not only will there be many more superhero films in the future , but also this summer wo n't be the last moviegoers see of the @entity11 and @entity22 on the big screen ( not to mention the individual @entity11 -- " @entity156 , " " @entity157 " and " captain america 2 " -- which are already in the works			2
) " the genre has been popular for decades and is here to stay , " @entity89 said			1
" the main factor will be for studios to release the right number of comic films each year and to not overdo it as any genre can be hurt by an overabundance of product			2
i think the marketplace can handle three to four superhero films per year			0
" share your " @entity11 " review but can @entity173 live on a few main superhero characters alone ? the chances of a " @entity45 " sequel look slimmer with each passing day , " @entity176 " plans fell through several years ago , and it 's anyone 's guess as to how next year 's @entity77 reboot , " @entity182 , " will be received			1
what about that @entity27 ' " @entity189 " film ( which , if not for a 2008 writers ' strike , might well have beaten @entity188 's " @entity11 " to the screen by a good many years ) ? one person who had something to say about that possibility was " @entity11 " writer / director @entity193 ( who once tried his hand at " @entity176 " ) , at a recent press conference			1
" @entity27 has a harder time of it than @entity188 because their characters are ( from ) an old , a bygone era , where characters were bigger than we were , " he said			1
" and ... they 've amended that , but @entity188 really cracked the code in terms of ' they 're just like us			2
' so a dose of that sort of veracity that @entity188 really started with ' @entity44 , ' i think you should use that as your base			1
" @entity193 pointed to 2002 's " @entity39 " as a model of a successful superhero film by staying true to the comic while also being entertaining as a movie			1
@entity65 had a few ideas for the next big superhero on the screen , even if " @entity189 " does n't pan out			0
" i think the @entity222 ( from @entity27 ) has the potential to be a big hit , given his rogues ' gallery and great years of history to work with , " he said			2
" for @entity188 , @entity228 could be their ' @entity16 , ' at least to a degree			0
and it would be great to see their ' cosmic ' characters break loose on film -- @entity234 , @entity235 , ms. @entity236 and so on			0
" no matter what @entity173 comes up with next -- there are still rumors of an " @entity241 " film out there and a reboot of " @entity244 " -- fans know that after this summer the movie studios will keep trying to assemble the right elements for a superhero blockbuster .			1

@entity173 bringing back box - office *juggernauts* @entity44 , @entity22 and @entity39
2012 may be a peak year for superheroes on film , with much more to come
writer - director : @entity27 characters often face more challenges than @entity188
