since the report 's release , the total number of released detainees has risen to about 560 , @entity23 officials said			2
@entity23 statistics indicate that there was a slight increase in the release of detainees from @entity9 at the end of 2008 , and the number of released detainees turning to or suspected of turning to the insurgency is almost double , from 7 percent a few years ago , @entity23 officials familiar with the information told @entity1			1
the report said that between december 2008 and march 2009 , nine former detainees were added to the confirmed list ; six of them had been on the suspected list			0

the report categorizes as " confirmed " any former detainee identified as involved in terrorist activity by a preponderance of evidence -- such as fingerprints , dna , photo match or reliable or well - corroborated intelligence			2
" what 's clear is we are not seeing recidivism on the decline , " said a defense official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue			0
@entity23 spokesman @entity102 declined to say what officials think is the reason for the increase , but said the @entity3 monitors released detainees as well as it can			0
the @entity23 's report on recidivism identified almost 30 former detainees confirmed or suspected to have gone on to fight , including @entity32 and @entity34 , and includes examples of what these men did after their release			0

within four months , the @entity3 military said , he was recaptured in @entity126 attacking @entity3 troops there , with paperwork that said he was a @entity131 member in good standing			0
@entity134 , who was released from @entity9 in december 2007 and set free in @entity126 , has become a powerful @entity131 military commander in southern @entity126 , and the @entity3 suspects he is responsible for several attacks on @entity3 forces there , the military said			2
a senior @entity3 military official last may said he believes @entity134 is using his @entity9 experience to build on his " rock star status " among the @entity131			0
the @entity3 military had no updated information on the status of @entity134 for this story			0
