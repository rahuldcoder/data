-- much has been made in recent years about @entity2 's growing gap between rich and poor			1
i 'm sure you feel beaten over the head with statistics comparing the struggling 99 % with the top 1 % of earners , those chosen few whose economic and political clout of rich few has increased to levels not seen since the @entity13			2
so i 'll spare you the stats and simply ask one question that 's not considered nearly often enough in the @entity17 era : is @entity2 's current income distribution fair ? forget about how we got here			1
forget the @entity21 suits and the cardboard - holding protesters			2
pretty much delete 2007 to 2013 from your brain			0
is the system fair ? and what information do you need in order to decide ? for intellectual guidance , i 'm turning to the work of the late philosopher @entity35 , whose 1971 book " @entity37 " was written about eight years before this rich - poor gap in the @entity2 started to widen			1
@entity35 argues , in a roundabout way , that a society is unfair if its citizens would not agree to be randomly reassigned to another income class			2
@entity43 , an associate professor at @entity44 , explained it to me this way : imagine you 're moving to a new country , but when you do , you will randomly be assigned to any income level that currently exists in that society			2
would you move ? if so , it 's fair			0
if not ? well ... this idea is great as far as thought experiments go , but how should i know whether i would make that gamble ? like most @entity2 , i tend to come into contact with people who are very much like me , economically at least			1
most of my friends have gone to college			0
many hold jobs in highly skilled industries			0
there 's a range , and i do live in a neighborhood with a serious homelessness problem , but i do n't engage the full spectrum of modern @entity2 wealth -- from the very poor to the extremely rich -- in my day to day life , and i bet that you do n't either , if you 're honest			1
it 's hard to assess the state of inequality if it 's partly invisible			2
would i play that @entity35 lottery ? i 'm not sure			0
so i 'm going to test this theory in real life			0
and i 'm going to call it the @entity77 , named for the philosopher whose work inspired this journey			1
this week , i 'll be going to an undisclosed location , which happens to be the most unequal place * in @entity2			1
i 'm going to meet people from all five income brackets , spend time with them , trying to get a real understanding of the economic challenges they face			2
step away from the statistics			0
and then i 'll decide : is this the @entity2 i want to live in ? do you ? does everyone in this country have a more or less equal chance of success if they work hard and want to get ahead , as politicians from both parties argue they should ? consider this a referendum not on this undisclosed place but on inequality in @entity2 writ large			1
the @entity77 and the stories that will follow originated with you			1
this summer , i asked readers of this column to vote on five stories you wanted me to cover as part of the @entity107 project			1
income inequality was the top pick , with 16,789 of 32,546 voters putting this issue in their top five			1
this test is just the start of a big conversation on the topic			2
i invite you to follow the journey on a @entity119 called " @entity77 , " or on @entity120			1
i 'll be tweeting with the hashtag # rawlstest			0
if you have questions about the project or for the people i encounter , please ask			0
at the end of the experiment , i 'll ask you to consider this fairness question with me			0
then , if needed , we can get into the messy details about what would make our society better			0
until then , think about the @entity35 lottery and whether you might play it			0
and wish me luck ! * data note : there are many ways to measure the " most unequal place " in the @entity2			1
by one measure , which i 'm not disclosing for fear of giving away the location , i 'm in the most unequal place in the country			1
by others , i could be in @entity145			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity148 .			0

income inequality will be the focus of the next @entity107 story
16,789 of 32,546 @entity0 voters picked the topic ; it was the top choice
@entity157 is traveling to the most unequal place in @entity2
