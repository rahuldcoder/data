he spent more than 21 straight hours railing against any government funding for @entity3			1
then @entity4 sen. @entity4 of @entity5 joined the other 99 senators from both parties in voting wednesday to move ahead on a spending plan expected to do just that			1
the rare 100 - 0 vote on a procedural step means the spending measure that would avoid a partial government shutdown next week now can be amended by @entity14 to restore funding for president @entity17 's signature health care reforms , which had been eliminated last week by @entity18			1
@entity4 led a group of tea party conservatives in trying to block @entity14 consideration of the spending legislation because @entity24 majority leader @entity23 made clear his caucus would remove the provision that defunded @entity3			1
however , @entity4 came under strong criticism from fellow @entity4 for that strategy , which called for @entity4 senators to filibuster the @entity18 measure that -- in its original form -- would defund programs under the @entity3 passed in 2010 and upheld by the @entity33 last year			1
@entity34 up over @entity36 shutdown battle the confusion of @entity4 's strategy was apparent wednesday when he voted with @entity14 for the @entity39 to take up the measure less than two hours after his marathon speech against it that began tuesday afternoon and continued overnight and through the morning			1
an aide to @entity4 told @entity44 chief congressional correspondent @entity43 that the senator always intended to allow formal consideration of the @entity18 measure , adding that @entity4 would vote against it once @entity14 restored the @entity3 funding			1
however , nothing in @entity4 's words or actions preceding the vote indicated that was his intention			1
instead , he had urged his colleagues to unite against the spending plan , saying voting for it was tantamount to supporting @entity3			1
" any senator who votes ( to move forward with debate on the @entity18 measure ) is voting to give @entity23 the authority to fund @entity3 , " @entity4 told bash on monday			1
after wednesday 's vote , @entity4 told reporters that his long night sought to unite republicans to block any funding for @entity3			1
" coming into this debate we clearly were not united , " he said			0
" there were significant divisions in the conference			0
i hope those divisions dissolve ; that we come together in party unity " with all 46 republicans preventing a final vote on the spending plan once @entity14 amend it to fund @entity3			1
@entity4 and other tea party conservatives wanted to prevent the @entity14 from taking up the spending measure passed last week by the @entity4 - controlled @entity18 that makes continued government funding contingent on denying any money for @entity3			1
how this affects you while his drawn - out floor speech did not constitute a filibuster , it was intended to rally opposition to the state goal of @entity14 to restore the @entity3 funding			1
however , @entity4 lacked support for his tactics from @entity14 @entity4 leader @entity88 of @entity89 and other influential veterans including sens. @entity91 of @entity92 and @entity93 of @entity94			1
in the end , @entity4 voted with them to open the spending plan to revisions by the @entity24 - led chamber			1
@entity23 called @entity4 's all - night speech a " waste of time " as the nation faced a possible partial shutdown of the government if @entity104 fails to authorize government spending beyond monday , when the current fiscal year ends			1
to @entity23 , the tactic reflected a perspective that a " bad day for government " amounted to a " good day " for tea party conservatives			2
earlier wednesday , @entity93 told @entity44 that a better idea would be to get the bill back to the @entity18 as soon as possible so the @entity4 majority there can offer a compromise			2
" @entity18 members are already talking about how they might respond if the defunding component ends up being stripped out , " @entity93 said , adding he hoped that the @entity14 would " give the @entity18 some time to respond in a thoughtful way			2
" with @entity3 markets for the uninsured set to open on october 1 , which also begins the new fiscal year , @entity4 opponents consider this their last best chance to undermine or amend the health care reforms			2
a possible @entity4 counter-proposal floated by @entity93 would delay its full implementation for a year			0
he noted that @entity17 already postponed another component affecting business implementation of health care reforms for a year			0
under the process planned by @entity23 , a final @entity14 vote on the revised spending plan would occur over the weekend to leave the @entity18 a day at most to reconsider it			1
however , @entity23 said wednesday he wanted the @entity14 to complete its work on the measure as soon as possible			2
@entity4 , as he approached the conclusion of his overnight speech , thanked the @entity14 staff and others " who have endured this @entity145 death march			1
" when he began at 2:40 p.m. tuesday , @entity4 said he intended to " speak in support of defunding @entity3 until i am no longer able to stand			2
" he filled the ensuing hours with a blend of political rhetoric and emotional pleas for republicans like @entity93 to unite in opposition to @entity3			0

' @entity169 ' gets a reading on tuesday night , he read the dr. @entity173 children 's classic " @entity169 " to his daughters			0
as he reached 18 hours of holding the @entity14 floor on wednesday morning , @entity4 compared his anti-obamacare effort to the " @entity178 " films			1
referring to having heard someone use the phrase " rebellion against oppression , " @entity4 said those words " conjured up to me the rebel alliance fighting against the empire			0
the empire being the @entity188 , establishment			0
" " and indeed immediately on hearing that phrase i wondered if at some point we would see a tall gentleman in a mechanical breathing apparatus come forward and say in a deep voice , ` @entity158 , i am your father			0
' " @entity4 said his effort " is a fight to restore freedom to the people			0
this is a fight to get the @entity188 establishment , the empire , to listen to the people			0
and just like in the ' @entity178 ' movies the empire will strike back			0
but at the end of the day i think the rebel alliance , i think the people will prevail			0
" later , he called for @entity14 @entity4 to show the same courage as their party colleagues in the @entity18 in making a stand to defund @entity3			1
he alluded to the risks faced by the signers of the @entity213 , noting they were mostly wealthy landowners who faced hanging for treason for their actions			0
what 's @entity4 's deal ? at 9 a.m. wednesday , @entity4 was alone on the floor , except for the presiding officer , @entity24 sen. @entity220			1
@entity220 and @entity4 engaged in some hostile exchanges , with the @entity223 @entity222 accusing @entity4 of trying to deny health care coverage for tens of millions of currently uninsured @entity225 while enjoying the benefits of a federal health care program			0
@entity4 responded that @entity3 was flawed and hurting the country , and the focus should be on a better solution instead of continuing on with a failed system			2
what you need to know about the possible shutdown two sides battle it out on social media earlier , @entity4 sought to define his battle as purely about principle , saying : " this fight is not about any member of this body			2
this fight is not about personalities			0
" " look , most @entity225 could not give a flying flip about a bunch of politicians in @entity188 , " he said			0
" who cares ? almost all of us are in cheap suits with bad haircuts ! who cares ? " supporters cheered him on through social media , and # @entity255 became one of the most popular hashtags on @entity258			0
but supporters of the health care law made themselves heard as well			0

" 5 strange things about debt ceiling politics key @entity4 critical of @entity4 strategy @entity4 also has been the target of criticism by some top @entity4			0
@entity4 infighting over how best to prevent a government shutdown while defunding @entity3 escalated tuesday as @entity271 publicly dismissed @entity4 's more confrontational strategy			1
@entity4 's @entity4 critics believe his strategy is politically suicidal , arguing there is no way to stop @entity3 as long as @entity14 maintain control of the @entity14 and @entity17 is in the @entity18			1
they believe that trying to do so by forcing a shutdown -- or preventing an increase in the debt ceiling next month -- will backfire by harming the economy and damaging the @entity4 brand			2

the @entity18 rejects negotiations on the debt issue , saying something as fundamental as ensuring the good credit of the @entity225 must be above politics			0
