@entity0 -- as @entity2 in the @entity3 cheered the death of @entity5 , president @entity6 on thursday called the fate of the former @entity2 leader both the end of a " long and painful chapter for the people of @entity2 " and the hallmark of a successful @entity3 foreign policy			1
in the first official government remarks on the killing of a longtime foe who was behind terrorist attacks against @entity3 citizens , @entity6 pledged @entity3 support as @entity2 builds a democratic system from the ruins of dictatorship			2
" you have won your revolution , " he said to the @entity2 people			2
@entity6 also praised the efforts of @entity3 military personnel who took part in the @entity31 - led military mission that launched thousands of airstrikes in support of @entity2 's rebel forces			1
" without putting a single @entity3 service member on the ground , we achieved our objectives , " @entity6 said in heralding a strategy that " demonstrated what collective action can achieve in the 21st century			0
" in an obvious reference to @entity43 and the crackdown on dissent by president @entity46 , @entity6 noted that @entity5 's death proved " once more that the rule of an iron fist inevitably comes to an end			1
" " across the @entity54 world , citizens have stood up to claim their rights , " the president said			0
" youth are delivering a powerful rebuke to dictatorship , and those leaders who try to deny human dignity will not succeed			0
" his statement , delivered in the @entity63 , followed hours of silence by top government officials as initial reports that @entity5 had been captured or killed emerged from @entity2			1
it was a very different scene hours later outside the @entity69 , as dozens of people waved and wrapped themselves in the @entity2 flag while cheering @entity5 's death			1
many sang to the beat of a drum thursday evening , while one celebrant held a hand - drawn sign showing a newborn baby drawn over the outline of @entity2 -- symbolizing a country reborn			2
secretary of state @entity80 was in @entity81 when she said " wow " after an aide handed her a @entity83 that spoke of @entity5 's capture			1
at the time , she stressed the reports were " unconfirmed " and noted similar stories had proven false , politicians were less reticent , especially as it became more clear that @entity5 was in fact dead			2
sens. @entity90 and @entity91 , both foreign affairs veterans , were among several legislators who remarked about @entity5 's death long before @entity6 issued his statement			1
@entity91 , an @entity96 @entity95 who lost to @entity6 in the 2008 presidential election , called it a " great day " and said the administration he previously criticized for withholding full @entity3 military capacity in @entity2 " deserves great credit			2
" " obviously , i had different ideas on the tactical side , but ... the world is a better place , and the @entity2 people now have a chance , " @entity91 told @entity1			2
@entity90 , a @entity109 @entity108 , said @entity6 's policy of building a @entity31 - led coalition for the @entity2 mission " demonstrated clear - eyed leadership , patience and foresight by pushing the international community into action			1
" " though the administration was criticized both for moving too quickly and for not moving quickly enough , it is undeniable that the @entity31 campaign prevented a massacre and contributed mightily to @entity5 's undoing without deploying boots on the ground or suffering a single @entity3 fatality , " @entity90 said			1
rep. @entity126 , the chairman of the @entity69 intelligence committee , cheered the news that @entity5 's " brutal regime is finally over			1
" at the same time , the @entity130 @entity95 stressed what he deemed an urgent need to secure " @entity2 's large stockpile of chemical and other advanced weapons " in this period of transition			2
vice president @entity138 noted that the @entity3 role in the campaign cost no more than $ 2 billion and that no @entity3 lives were lost , saying : " this is more a prescription about how we ought to deal going forward			2
" we do not have to do it ourselves			0
... the @entity31 alliance worked like it was designed to do , " @entity138 told @entity1 's @entity145 in @entity146 , calling @entity5 " one bad guy			1
this was real burden sharing			0
" according to figures from the @entity152 and @entity153 , the total bill as of september 30 for the @entity3 role in the @entity2 campaign was about $ 1.3 billion			0
however , @entity156 sen. @entity156 of @entity157 complained that @entity6 's strategy unnecessarily extended the conflict by withholding full @entity3 involvement and firepower			0
" if the @entity3 had gotten involved early , aggressively and decisively , today would have happened months ago , " @entity156 said			0
" sometimes you do n't just have to do the right thing			0
you have to do the right thing at the right time , and i think this administration failed to do that			0
" the news of @entity5 's death marked the end of the seven - month @entity31 - led @entity2 campaign initially spearheaded by the @entity3 to prevent @entity5 's forces from attacking @entity173 , the opposition stronghold			1
@entity31 secretary general @entity174 announced thursday , hours after @entity5 was killed , that the alliance " will terminate our mission " in the @entity178 nation			1
@entity180 visited the @entity2 capital of @entity182 this week , making her the highest - level @entity3 government official to go to the country since 2008			0
in a @entity1 interview in @entity81 as the reports of @entity5 's death were emerging , @entity180 said @entity2 's governing @entity188 did n't want to begin the process of forming a new government until @entity5 was captured or killed , fearing " security problems			1
" while challenges remain for @entity2 , @entity180 said that @entity5 's absence -- meaning that he can not marshal popular support , pay for mercenaries or lead a guerrilla warfare campaign -- would make " a big difference			1
" " ( his death brings ) a lot of legitimacy and validation and relief to the formation of the new government , " she said			0
the killing of @entity5 also raises anew the question of whether a @entity2 convicted of helping bomb @entity207 in 1988 , killing 270 people , would be forced to resume serving a prison sentence in @entity211			1
@entity212 returned to a hero 's welcome in @entity2 two years ago after his humanitarian release from a @entity211 prison due to advanced cancer			2
he is still alive today , and some @entity3 legislators have mounted a vigorous campaign for his return to prison			0
house speaker @entity222 , an @entity223 @entity95 , said the @entity3 can be a " willing friend and partner " to @entity2 's new government if it can " resolve all issues associated with @entity5 's terrorism - sponsored activities			1
" to the brother of a victim of the @entity233 bombing , @entity5 's death represents justice delayed but not denied			1
@entity235 said that when his brother @entity239 died , " i promised him and myself that i would n't let it go , that there would be justice			0
" " today is an example that after 22 years , finally justice is done , " @entity239 said			0
" i owed him that			0
and i feel that the @entity2 people have helped me fulfill my promise to him , an example that we 've been able to do that			0
" @entity1 's @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 contributed to this report .			0
