-- @entity2 president @entity1 said sunday that a critical phase in the transfer of security authority from international to domestic forces would begin march 21 , a precursor to a planned full handover three years hence			1
@entity1 made the announcement during a speech at the @entity11 , an annual gathering of diplomatic and military leaders from @entity15 and other nations			1
" we are determined to demonstrate @entity2 leadership and ownership of the transition process , " he said			2
@entity24 secretary - general @entity23 , in an interview conducted with conference organizers and posted on its website , explained this move next month marks the start of " a gradual transition to lead @entity2 responsibility -- province by province , district by district			1
" thus , @entity2 may take over full control in some locales relatively soon , while the process may take much longer elsewhere			2
" i 'm very optimistic about this timetable leading to @entity2 ( security ) responsibility all over @entity2 by may 2014 , " said @entity23			1
" but i have to add , that obviously this development will depend on conditions on the ground			0
" during his speech , @entity1 credited the influx of 70,000 international forces in 2010 for improving the situation and helping @entity2 security forces			1
he frequently mentioned the fight against the @entity49 terror group , but did not mention the @entity50 -- which was ousted from power in 2001 , for harboring @entity49 , and has been behind many attacks since			0
" we have regained the initiative , " @entity1 said			2
" security in the country is better than it was a year before , and the year before that			0
" in a letter to troops late last month , @entity59 gen. @entity58 voiced a similar sentiment , saying the surge " inflicted enormous losses " on militants and weakened terror networks			0
it came at a steep price : last year was the deadliest for coalition and @entity59 troops in @entity2 since the war began			1
there were 708 such troops killed , of which 498 were @entity59 service members			0
@entity58 , the top @entity59 commander in @entity2 , said insurgents were now on the defensive in @entity2 , and pointed specifically to progress in @entity78 , where one - fifth of the @entity2 population lives			2
still , he cautioned that past success does n't guarantee a smooth road ahead			0
" in sum , 2010 was a year of significant , hard - fought accomplishments , " @entity58 wrote			0
" the year ahead is likely to be a tough one , too			0
" president @entity84 has promised to begin a gradual withdrawal of @entity59 troops from @entity2 starting in july , a pledge he reiterated during his recent @entity88 address			1
during the speech sunday , @entity1 also acknowledged issues of corruption in @entity2 , focusing especially on contracts that fell outside the @entity78 government 's control			1
the president outlined efforts to curb abuses , which is the past he said had " undermined the capacity of the state rather than building it			0
" " with the @entity59 and @entity24 , we 're overhauling the system to make contracting an instrument of good rather than bad governance , " he said			0
by 2015 , @entity1 predicted that @entity2 will have " binding agreements with the @entity59 and long - term partnerships with @entity24 " -- noting that the shift in security responsibility does not mean a clean break with international forces that have been engaged there for nearly a decade			1
as to @entity24 's role , the current head of the military and political western alliance said he expected that some of its troops may still be in @entity2 even after 2014			2
" i ... foresee a continued international presence , beyond the date when our combat mission ends , with the aim to assist the @entity2 , " @entity23 said			1
@entity1 closed his speech sunday by again thanking other nations for committing financial resources to @entity2 , as well as the human sacrifice many have made			1
and he urged them to continue to help , claiming @entity2 's prosperity and security was vital to the interests of the region and the world			2
" some journey is left and that journey will not be easy , " @entity1 said			0
" but it 's a journey worth taking			0
