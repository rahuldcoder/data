ending energy poverty is central to my vision of a resurgent @entity3			0
i am an entrepreneur -- one born , raised , and educated in @entity3 , creating businesses that span the continent			0
i have experienced how lack of reliable power has constrained human potential and stifled economic growth			1
currently , 589 million of my fellow @entity3 have no access to electricity and many millions more lack reliable access			1
this holds back education , drives up the cost of business , and negatively impacts healthcare			0
we are a continent of entrepreneurs , some of the smartest in the world			0
but how many aspiring business people can really succeed , and create critical jobs , if they do not have light or the cost of electricity is more than 55 % of the operating costs of their business ? last week i joined officials from the @entity32 agencies , @entity31 , @entity33 and @entity34 , along with representatives from @entity32 corporations @entity36 and @entity37 , in testifying before the @entity32 @entity38 on the progress of president @entity42 's @entity41 initiative			1
the program , launched last july , has set a goal of generating 10,000 mw of additional power in the next five years , and targets an initial six countries , my home country @entity44 included			2
@entity41 calls for $ 7 billion in @entity32 financial support and has already leveraged an additional $ 9 billion in private - sector commitments			1
recognizing the centrality of power to @entity3 's ability to sustain its own development , @entity51 is now looking to enact legislation that would ensure that the @entity58 initiative defines the future of @entity32 engagement on the continent			1
the @entity62 last month passed the @entity63 which seeks to double the target of new generation capacity to 20,000 mw			0
the @entity38 is expected to introduce its own legislation in the coming weeks			0
in both houses of @entity51 there is broad - based bipartisan support			0
@entity41 has already served to focus the @entity32 private sector on @entity3 as the new frontier for energy investment and has encouraged @entity74 countries not selected as @entity41 countries to undertake reforms of their regulatory structures , so as to participate in future power deals and partnerships			1
my own company , @entity83 , through our subsidiary , @entity84 , committed to invest up to $ 2.5 billion to generate @entity86 of electricity over five years , 20 % of the @entity32 government 's initial goal			1
our first transaction has been the @entity92 power plant in the @entity94 region of @entity44			2
the initial investment in the @entity97 plant was $ 300 million			1
when we first took over the plant in november 2013 , its power output was less than @entity100 ; today , that has been more than doubled			0
we project that @entity92 power plant will be generating @entity103 by the end of this year			0
we are also partnering with @entity37 and @entity36 on a 1000 @entity106 expansion costing $ 1 billion usd			2
we are on track to fulfill our commitment to @entity41 and we will be producing the equivalent of almost half of the current total output in @entity44			2
in 2015 , we will begin plans to generate power in other @entity115 and @entity74 countries			1
the program also has allowed @entity74 businesses to show to the world that they can be equal partners in the process			2
we are bringing capital and know how , creating genuine partnerships , which benefits all sides			0
i coined the term " @entity125 " to describe our approach to business -- our belief that long - term investment in key sectors , like in power , can create economic prosperity and social wealth , benefiting investors and @entity3 's development future			1
yet @entity41 must be viewed by the administration and @entity51 as only a start			2
the initiative is valued at $ 7 billion and @entity3 's power infrastructure needs are estimated to be $ 300 billion			1
so there is more that we all need to do			0
@entity51 should pass legislation before the end of this @entity51 to secure the expansion of access to electricity in @entity3 as a development and foreign policy priority			0
given the long - term nature of investments in the power sector , these policies must by codified so that they carry over to the next @entity152 and the next @entity51			0
like the @entity154 more than a decade ago , such legislation would lay the foundation for a new @entity32 - @entity3 relationship : one based on partnership for mutual economic benefit and the empowerment of the private sector			1
the @entity32 government should also continue to encourage policy reforms by @entity74 governments and institutions			1
there is no amount of capital investment or entrepreneurial zeal that will provide affordable and sustainable access to electricity for @entity3 's one billion people , without the full buy - in and energetic support of @entity74 governments			1
@entity51 should also make engagement with the @entity74 private sector a priority in oversight and new policy - making			2
public - private partnerships are critical to developing the @entity74 continent , particularly in the power sector			1
it is important to recognize the revolution that has taken place in the @entity74 private sector -- a sea change in terms of innovation , know - how and governance values			2
@entity191 has taken up the challenge			0
we have a long way to go , but like all long journeys , the journey to infrastructure sufficiency begins with the first step -- or , in this case , the first $ 300 million			0
we believe that the @entity41 initiative , which places @entity3 as partners in their own development , will help the continent to emerge as a strong player in the global economy and we are confident that history will remember those who played a role in making it happen			1

he has *pledged* $ 2.5 billion to @entity32 president @entity42 's " @entity41 " initiative
