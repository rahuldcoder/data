-- tar balls believed to be from the undersea gusher in the @entity3 have reached the shores of @entity6 's @entity5 , a foundation that monitors the watershed reported monday			1
the area affected covers a stretch of up to five miles near the city of @entity14 , northeast of @entity10 , said @entity15 , executive director of the @entity16			0
she estimated the amount of oil that has reached the lake at less than 100 barrels , with no hydrocarbon smell			2
" they are about the size of a silver dollar , maybe a little bigger , kind of dispersed in long intervals			1
it 's not as dense as it could be , so we 're thankful for that , " @entity15 said			0
cleanup crews had collected more than a half - ton of the tar balls -- 1,020 pounds -- by monday evening , and the oil will be tested to confirm it came from the undersea well that has been spewing into the @entity3 since april , the @entity30 in @entity31 said monday night			1
but @entity15 told @entity0 , " they 've got to be from the spill			0
" tar balls had previously been spotted in @entity39 , which connects the lake with @entity41			1
officials in @entity10 and @entity44 parishes have been using heavy booms , barges and skimmers to defend @entity5 since the early days of the disaster , but @entity15 said high waves and strong easterly and southeasterly winds have complicated the effort			1
" the main thing is that they are an indicator that it could be coming more so this way , " she said			0
state officials have closed a swath of the southern part of the 630 - square - mile lake to fishing following the discovery , but there was no sign of impact to wildlife as of monday , @entity15 said			1
the @entity67 reported sunday that a shift in weather patterns could send more oil toward sensitive shores in @entity41 and @entity6 , and bad weather over the past few days has significantly hampered cleanup efforts			2
@entity15 said that pattern was expected to persist for at least three more days			0
federal officials have estimated that between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels ( 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons ) of oil have been spewing into the @entity3 daily since april 20 , when the drilling rig @entity78 exploded and sank in about 40 miles off the @entity6 coast			2
efforts to plug the gusher have so far failed , and oil from the spill has been reported as far east as the central @entity84 .			0
