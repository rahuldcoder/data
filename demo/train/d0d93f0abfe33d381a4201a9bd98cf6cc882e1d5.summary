@entity0 -- immigrant rights activists are calling on @entity4 retailers to stop selling two controversial " @entity7 " costumes that have surfaced for @entity6 , saying the outfits are a broadside attack on illegal immigrants			1
the " @entity7 " costume was being offered by retailers including @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
the " @entity21 , " manufactured by @entity22 , includes an orange jumpsuit , similar to prison garb , with " @entity7 " stamped in black across the chest ; a space alien mask ; and a fake @entity20			1
the " @entity26 " also includes a space alien mask , this time with a dark handlebar mustache and a baseball cap			1
the @entity27 said it began receiving e-mails from concerned legal immigrants on friday			1
in response , @entity27 wrote a letter asking several retailers , including @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 , to stop offering the costume			1
as of saturday afternoon , @entity13 had pulled the products , and some links to the costumes on other sites were no longer functional			2
@entity13 said the " @entity7 " costume was inadvertently uploaded to its web site due to a data entry error			1
" it is never our intent to offend the consumers with the products we offer , " a company statement said			0
the makers of the costumes could not be reached for comment on saturday			0
@entity50 - @entity49 , the director of communications for @entity27 , said he initially thought the costume was a stab at harmless satire			2
but when he saw the @entity20 , he realized it was an swipe at illegal immigrants			1
" this was an ignorant attempt to poke fun at a small community , " said @entity49			0
political satire and @entity6 often merge			0
costumes depicting former well - known political figures are often seen along side those depicting @entity66 or @entity67			2
to some , the attempted humor of the costumes falls flat			0
@entity70 said both of his parents were illegal immigrants in the @entity4			1
he felt the costumes were offensive because they depicted illegal immigrants as " not one of us			1
" " i have a lot of illegal immigrant friends , " said @entity70			2
" if i showed them that costume , it would really hurt them			0
" despite the controversy , some stores say the costumes have been a hit			0
" it 's a very well - recommended costume , " said an employee at @entity87 's , a costume store in @entity0			2
the store has sold seven costumes for $ 39.99 apiece and is set to receive another shipment			0
@entity93 , the president of @entity94 , said he intends to buy the costume , and calls the reaction unfounded			0
" the only people getting upset are the hyper - sensitive , over-politically correct , pro-amnesty , illegal alien - supporting nuts , " said @entity93			1
" you ca n't attack people 's freedom in this country			0
" " i think having a costume like that is distasteful , " said @entity103 , outside of @entity87 's			0
" but if it 's not illegal , i think it 's alright for them to sell it			0
