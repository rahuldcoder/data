-- the garden is overflowing with weeds and trash is riotously strewn across the lower floors			0
upstairs , a makeshift curtain dangles by a string while an assortment of shelves and cupboards clutter the untidy space below			0
not quite what you 'd expect from a $ 1.1 million ( £ 650,000 ) property -- but that 's the price sought by the overseas owners of a house in @entity18 that until recently was the domain of illegal squatters			1
the three - bedroom home came on to the market in the @entity24 area of the @entity26 capital last week and is described by estate agents as " spacious " and an " exciting opportunity " for potential buyers despite the obvious need for " modernization			1
" clearly , the owners are hoping to cash in on the city 's red - hot property sector			2
but $ 1.1 million ? " @entity24 as an area has witnessed a phenomenal uplift with property prices almost doubling in certain regions of the area , " said @entity35 , managing director of @entity36 , the estate agents in charge of selling the house when contacted by @entity0			1
" for example in november 2012 , our company sold a three bedroom period mid-terraced , in need of some modernization but nothing too major , for £ 350,000			0
" " properties on that same street with an identical footprint are now currently on the market and achieving prices in the region of £ 650,000 ( $ 1.1 million )			1
this is not an isolated case but can be seen to be true of most properties within the locality regardless of style and size			0
" it 's not just @entity24 feeling the heat			0
property prices in @entity18 increased by an average of 18.5 % year on year in may according to the @entity26 @entity68 , their fastest annual rise in 11 years			1
this stands in comparison to a rise of 6.5 % across the rest of the @entity26 , leading some experts to conclude that the capital 's property market is overheating			2
relatively low numbers of affordable new homes being built , generous government lending schemes designed to make deposits more affordable for first - time buyers and an influx of foreign investors plowing vast amounts into @entity18 's most salubrious districts have all played their part in the booming prices			2
while @entity24 is n't traditionally one of the city 's most exclusive neighborhoods , its favorable location , good transport links as well as its up - and - coming vibe has ensured its status as a desirable spot			0
@entity35 still believes there 's more to come from the area given the underlying market conditions and high - demand for property -- although he cautions that other parts of @entity18 may soon start to cool off			1
" although prices have gone up in general , this is the one part of @entity24 that has not yet peaked , " he said			0
even still , @entity35 acknowledged that it is highly unusual for owners to put their property on the market in such an unkempt manner			0
" i would never advocate that any vendor puts their property on the market in such a condition unless they are open to offers that reflect the state and cost of remedial works , " he said			2
" ( but ) such is the strength of the market at the moment that there are many who will still purchase the property as is , demonstrating that property ( and especially in @entity18 ) is still the number one choice for many not only as a home but also as a sure investment			1
