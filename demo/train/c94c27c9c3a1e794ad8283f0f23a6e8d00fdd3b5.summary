-- perhaps more important than the newest mystery surrounding @entity4 contractor @entity3 -- who paid the purported seven - figure sum to the @entity8 victims ' families who blessed his release from jail ? -- will be the political reaction within @entity8 , where the populace is already outraged over @entity3 ' fatal shooting of two men there , analysts said wednesday			1
the other potential impact of the " @entity3 , " as one analyst dubbed it , is whether it will damage diplomatic relations between the @entity21 and @entity8 , in which @entity21 depend on @entity8 in fighting terror and the @entity8 enjoy substantial @entity21 aid			1
" there is the curious question of who made the payment			0
i suppose it 's going to remain a mystery for a while , " said @entity28 , director of the @entity30 , and @entity31			0
" his presence there and the story about his presence were kind of a mystery from the start , " @entity28 added			0
" now his presence in @entity8 ends with one more curiosity			2
i think the fallout from this is far from over			0
it will be interesting to see what the reaction is in @entity8			2
it 's been the lead story " in media there , he added			0
@entity3 was released under a @entity55 practice called diyat , or compensation , which is enshrined in @entity8 's penal code and allows victims ' families to pardon a murderer with or without being paid " blood money , " said the former chief justice of @entity8 's @entity64 , @entity65			1
although the origins of the payments in the @entity3 case are a significant political matter , the more imminent concern is whether average @entity8 will accept how " blood money " was paid to the victims ' families , analysts said			1
" what we 're watching for , " analyst @entity80 of the online global intelligence firm @entity81 said in a statement , " is to see which way public sentiment rules : whether it will accept this resolution as acceptable or whether they will be outraged and take to the streets			0
" on wednesday , it was n't known who paid the compensation to the families , and there were conflicting accounts over how much			1
a lawyer closely connected to the case said the payment was $ 1.4 million , but @entity94 province law minister @entity93 said that $ 2.34 million was paid to the legal heirs by the @entity21 government			0
a @entity21 official not authorized to speak for attribution insisted that the release of @entity3 was a decision made by the @entity8 and that there was " no quid pro quo " between @entity103 and @entity104			1
it was @entity8 officials who worked with the family in making the arrangements for what is referred to as " blood money , " the official said			1
the @entity21 " did not sit across from the families " to work out an arrangement , but the official acknowledged that there were " interagency discussions and a policy decision " for the @entity21 to agree to the arrangement , the official said			0
the official said " cooperation continues " between the @entity21 and @entity8 despite the recent controversy			2
" @entity124 happen periodically , " the official said , pointing to the @entity3 incident and the public disclosure of the name of the @entity4 's chief of station in @entity104			1
the @entity21 relationship with @entity8 " has evolved over the years " and " increasingly has the ability to withstand these kinds of disagreements , " said the official			2
secretary of state @entity129 , who said " we are very grateful " for the families ' decision , which enabled @entity3 to leave @entity8 , stressed that the @entity21 government did n't pay any compensation to the families , and she would n't say whether the @entity8 or a third party did			1
" we also have a @entity138 investigation that has begun into what happened in @entity140			0
and we 've communicated our strong support for the relationship between @entity8 and the @entity21 , which we consider to be of strategic importance , " @entity141 said during a press conference wednesday			2
analyst @entity146 , the former @entity4 station chief in @entity104 , said the @entity55 practice allowed both countries to save face in a difficult controversy			1
" it had become such a huge domestic political issue in @entity8 , and both sides had a very strong interest in finding some way out of the corner that they had been painted into , " @entity146 said			2
in recent years , the @entity21 government has compensated families accidentally injured during counterinsurgency warfare , said @entity146 , who 's now chairman of @entity160 , a financial advisory firm in @entity161 , @entity162			0
" let 's not forget that the @entity21 government has frequently paid blood money to people who have fallen victim to collateral damage in @entity168 and @entity169			1
so albeit that the details of this case are quite extraordinary and quite different from the usual ones in @entity169 and @entity168 , the idea of paying blood money under @entity55 is not new , " @entity146 said			1
in @entity177 , @entity178 , where @entity3 lives , his wife , @entity175 , defended him in an interview with reporters outside her their home			2
" i knew it was self - defense			0
he 's not a @entity186 as the @entity187 said , " @entity3 ' wife said			2
" he 's not an agent			0
he 's not any of these kind of crazy things that have been portrayed of him			0
" after being released from jail where he had been held since january , @entity3 was taken to @entity194 , @entity168 , on wednesday , where he was resting and receiving a medical exam , said the @entity21 official who asked not to be identified			1
@entity93 , the @entity94 province law minister , first told @entity8 media wednesday that the victims ' families did not want to press charges and added that @entity3 would be free to go			1
the statement came just hours after the @entity21 was charged with murder in connection with january shootings that left two @entity8 men dead			1
@entity93 later said that $ 1,169,500 was paid to 11 legal heirs of one victim and the same amount was paid to eight legal heirs of the others			0
the court asked the legal heirs whether there was any pressure on them to make this agreement , and they told the court that they forgave @entity3 on their own free will , @entity93 said			0
@entity3 claimed self - defense in the shootings and asserted the two men attacked him as he drove through a busy @entity140 neighborhood , but @entity140 police chief @entity224 said " it was clear - cut murder			1
" many @entity8 wanted @entity3 to be tried , and hard - line @entity8 clerics demanded that their government not release @entity3 to the @entity21 government			1
on wednesday , @entity3 appeared in the @entity140 court after the payment was made and was acquitted of the charges , in accordance with diyat , said the lawyer closely connected to the case			1
the court released @entity3 from two cases , the double murder and the carrying of an illegal gun			2
in the gun charge , the court fined @entity3 $ 250 and credited him with time served in jail , @entity93 said			0
the amount of diyat was not paid in front of the court to the legal heirs because the court needs only affidavits from the legal heirs saying that they have pardoned the accused , @entity93 said			0
@entity250 , the @entity21 consul general in @entity140 , escorted @entity3 after his release , @entity93 said			0
the @entity21 had been seeking the release of @entity3 from a @entity140 jail on the grounds that he has diplomatic immunity			0
@entity21 officials originally said @entity3 was a diplomat and later revealed that he is a @entity4 contractor , intensifying the already highly charged situation			1
@entity0 's @entity259 and @entity260 and journalist @entity261 contributed to this report .			0
