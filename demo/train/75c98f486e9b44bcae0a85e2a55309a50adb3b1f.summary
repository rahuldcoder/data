-- some mothers choose what their children will eat			1
others choose which children will eat and which will die			1
a @entity8 boy begs for food			1
one child dies from hunger every six seconds , an aid agency says			0
those mothers forced to make the grim life - or - death choices are the impoverished women @entity15 , executive director of @entity17 , encounters during her frequent trips to @entity8			1
@entity15 says @entity8 are so desperate for food that many mothers wait to name their newborns because so many infants die of malnourishment			1
other @entity8 mothers keep their children alive by parceling out food to them , but some make an excruciating choice when their food rationing fails , she says			1
they have to choose among their children , " says @entity15 , whose nonprofit group was formed to fight childhood malnutrition			1
" they try to keep them alive by feeding them , but sometimes they make the decision that this one has to go			0
" the rev. @entity40 declared in his @entity42 acceptance speech that " i have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies			0
" four decades later , @entity40 's wish remains unfulfilled			0
the global food market 's shelves are getting bare , hunger activists say -- and it will get worse			1
food riots erupted across the globe this year in countries such as @entity55 and @entity56			2
food pantries in the @entity58 also warned that they were running out of food because of unprecedented demand			1
the news from the @entity62 is even grimmer : a child dies of hunger every six seconds , and hunger now kills more people every year than @entity67 , malaria and tuberculosis combined			0
as @entity70 is marked , more people are asking : why are so many people starving and what , if anything , can be done to eradicate hunger ? the end of food ? @entity15 thinks hunger can be conquered			2
her group produces " @entity77 , " energy dense , peanut butter food that 's designed to ensure @entity8 children survive childhood			1
@entity77 is easy to make , store , preserve and distribute , she says			0
" it just takes the will to do it , " she says of eliminating hunger			0
" look at what we did for @entity88			0
we did n't have enough money for infrastructure , schools , but all of a sudden , we had all of this money for @entity88			2
" @entity94 , author of " @entity95 : the @entity99 for the @entity100 , " says the right to food should be seen as a human right			1
but , he says , powerful corporate food distributors control too much of the world 's food supply to ensure a robust global food supply			1
@entity94 says " 2008 was a record year in terms of harvest			0
there 's more food per person in 2008 than there 's ever been in history			2
the problem is not food , but how we distribute it			2
" other causes for the rise in global hunger have been documented			1
they include : surging oil costs have made it more expensive to harvest , fertilize , store and deliver food			1
the rise in droughts and hurricanes worldwide has wiped out crops and made farming more difficult			2
the world is running out of the raw materials -- water , oil , good farmland -- needed to keep the food system intact			1
" a lot of people have begun to understand at various levels that the food system , as it is , ca n't go on , " says @entity136 , author of " @entity137			1
" every time an @entity58 bites down on a steak or hamburger , they 're contributing to global hunger , @entity136 says			1
as other countries become more affluent , they 're copying our meat - heavy diet			0
the problem : it takes so much grain and other resources to produce meat , he says			0
" if the rest of the world were to eat like we do , the planet would collapse , " @entity136 says			0
" there 's been this unspoken assumption that the rest of the world wo n't eat meat like we do			2
that does n't go over well in countries like @entity168			2
" fixing our food system would be similar to weaning ourselves of our addiction to oil , @entity136 says			1
it 's going to require innovation , heavy business involvement and changes in public policy			0
people are going to have to find ways to grow food with less fertilizer and water , and use less energy to store and transport food , he says			2
much of this innovation will have to be driven not just by activist and aid workers , but by savvy business people , he says			0
" it 's going to have to be profitable or the market wo n't be interested in it , " @entity136 says			2
" and if the market is n't interested in it , it 's not going to happen			0
" in the meantime , @entity15 offers some of her own solutions			0
she says the practice of big foreign aid agencies shipping in food to poor countries like @entity8 needs to be modified			1
food has become too expensive to produce , ship and store , she says			0
" you ca n't count on big aid agencies showing up to save everybody , " she says			1
" not everybody can do it , and when they do it , it 's not soon enough and not long enough			0
" she suggests that more groups teach local farmers in poor places how to produce their own crops			0
in @entity8 , for example , her group employs 22 @entity8 who make @entity77 and teaches other farmers how to grow crops for the mixture			1
" instead of throwing fish in the crowd , we should be teaching people how to fish , " she says			0
until that day takes place , @entity15 , who is a pediatrician in @entity225 , @entity226 , will continue to make her trips to @entity8 , where mothers are forced to make their grim choices			1
" it 's the most difficult thing i 've ever done , " she says			0
" you realize how absolutely blessed you are by the fate of your soul coming down the chute in the @entity58 , " she says			2
" you wonder : why did this happen to me and not to them ? ' ''			0
