@entity0 -- after appearing briefly on the @entity5 administration 's short - list to run the @entity6 , homeland security secretary @entity2 now has to survive a congressional grilling on the president 's new immigration policy			1
testifying before the @entity10 on tuesday , @entity2 said he is " fully comfortable " that president @entity5 's executive action on immigration reform is within the president 's legal authority			1
@entity2 helped draft the president 's plan to shield up to 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and will make undocumented criminals a priority for deportation			1
" many of these individuals have committed no crimes and are not enforcement priorities			0
it is time that we acknowledge this as a matter of official policy and encourage eligible individuals to come out of the shadows , submit to criminal and national security background checks , and be held accountable , " @entity2 told the committee			2
republicans on the committee , starting with chairman @entity38 , questioned the authority and timing of @entity5 's executive action on immigration and the impact of @entity5 's action on illegal immigration			1
" the president 's unilateral actions to bypass @entity51 on nov. 20 undermine the @entity52 and threaten our democracy , " @entity38 , @entity46 , said in a statement before the hearing			2
@entity38 questioned the timing of @entity5 's decision to act on immigration reform , which came after the midterm elections , calling it " more of a political decision than a policy decision			1
" @entity2 would not comment on @entity5 's statements before he decided to use his executive authority on immigration , when @entity5 suggested he may not have the authority to act unilaterally to reform the immigration system			1
instead , @entity2 stressed that administration officials " spent months " with lawyers to ensure all executive actions on immigration are legal and said the @entity68 was repeatedly urged by members of @entity51 to hold off on executive action for months			2
and the incoming chair of the @entity68 's top oversight committee @entity73 rep. @entity73 hit @entity2 with a " gotcha " question during his speaking time			2
@entity2 found himself at odds with a statement @entity5 made just last week during an immigration speech while responding to hecklers " what do you say to someone who believes the president took action to change the law ? " @entity73 said			1
" we did not change the law , " @entity2 replied before @entity73 played the clip of @entity5 at the event last week , saying : " what you 're not paying attention to is i just took an action to change the law			1
" " so you say he did n't change the law , but the president says he changed the law , " @entity73 said			0
" somebody plays me an eight - word excerpt from a broader speech , i know it to be suspicious , " @entity2 retorted to laughter			0
@entity2 rejected rep. @entity104 's claims that @entity5 's immigration action would lead to a surge in illegal immigration , insisting that the order will prioritize recent illegal migrants			1
" recent arrivals are priorities for removal , " @entity2 said			0
" wherever i go i intend to highlight the fact that these new reforms prioritize recent illegal entrance			0
" the @entity5 administration had placed @entity2 on a short - list to replace outgoing defense secretary @entity118			1
but an official said tuesday that @entity2 is no longer in contention for the job			2
@entity2 stressed that he wants to work with @entity51 to pass comprehensive immigration reform , but another @entity123 rep. @entity123 said the issue is " a lack of trust of the @entity128 people in the administration to enforce the laws			2
" " why would you pass another law when the administration fails to enforce the current laws that are on the books			0
why pass another one that 's not going to be enforced either ? " @entity123 said			0
" i think congress can pass a bill when the @entity128 people start regaining trust in the administration to actually to their job and enforce the laws that are already on the books			0
" @entity2 pushed back and pinned the lack of a comprehensive bill on @entity51 inaction			0
" the president has said that would be his preference			0
the problem is we have no partner in @entity51 , " @entity2 said .			0
