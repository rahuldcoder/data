@entity0 , @entity1 -- a federal lawsuit was filed tuesday against @entity0 police over a september raid at a gay club , on behalf of 19 patrons who say they were forcibly searched and detained			1
the suit , filed by the gay - rights group @entity9 , names @entity0 police chief @entity10 and 48 officers who were at the @entity13 bar the night of september 10			1
" the @entity14 dispatched about 20 to 30 officers to the @entity13 , including its ' @entity17 ' unit dressed in @entity19 gear , " according to a statement from @entity9			1
" but inside the bar , the @entity14 found no public sex , no drugs or illegal weapons			2
" no patrons were charged with any crime , the organization said			2
during the raid , patrons were made to lie face down on the floor while background checks were run on everyone , the statement said			1
" @entity13 bar patrons heard anti-gay slurs ; were forced to lay in spilled beer and broken glass ; and one was forced to lie on the floor even though he had injured his back in the @entity42			1
" some of the patrons were restrained with handcuffs , and officers used excessive force , including shoving some people to the floor and kicking others on the floor , the lawsuit says			2
authorities searched everyone on the property , seizing their driver 's licenses or other identification , the suit says			2
" these actions were taken without particularized reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that any individual patron , let alone every person at the establishment , was involved in criminal activity whatsoever , " said the suit , filed in @entity60 for the @entity61			2
@entity0 city attorney @entity68 said in a statement monday that the city had not been served with the suit or had an opportunity to review it , so he would not comment			1
@entity68 's office told @entity2 on tuesday that its response was the same , as it had not seen the suit			0
the only charges filed were against @entity13 employees , for allegedly violating the city 's law about unlicensed adult entertainment " because four dancers were observed , in the words of the arresting officers , allegedly ' wearing underwear ' and ' dancing , ' " the lawsuit said			1
" imagine if the police walked into a @entity89 and see someone shoplifting , and because they see what they think is a crime taking place in @entity89 , they take everyone at @entity89 , throw them on the floor , spread their legs , put their hands in their pockets , take their ids , put their name in the computer , simply because they 're out of place or someone else may or may not be doing something wrong , " co-counsel @entity105 said at a news conference tuesday			0
the suit seeks damages and alleges that police violated the patrons ' constitutional rights and that the individual officers committed false imprisonment , assault , battery and trespassing			1
it also requests a jury trial			0
" the illegal activity going on in the @entity13 that night was committed by the @entity14 , " @entity119 , supervising senior staff attorney in @entity9 's southern regional office , based in @entity0 , said in the statement			1
" if it is @entity14 procedure for elderly men and wounded veterans to be thrown to the floor and harassed simply for being in a bar having a drink after work , then @entity14 should change its procedures			0
" " people have asked me why i 'm doing this , " plaintiff @entity132 told reporters			0
" i 'm not doing it because i have a vendetta against the police			0
i work for a police department			0
i 'm an emergency communications officer			0
i do my part to make sure these officers go home			0
i do n't work for the city of @entity0			1
" i was in the bar drinking beer , playing a video game , and i was dehumanized and humiliated and laid on the floor for no reason , " he said			0
" that 's why i 'm doing it			0
" the suit alleges undercover officers entered the bar before 11 p.m. and had a drink , then later " began screaming at patrons and employees to ' hit the floor ' and get down on the ground			1
" " several plaintiffs were in terror and feared for their lives , believing that the @entity13 was being robbed or invaded by criminals or gay - bashers who might kill or injure them , " the suit continues			1
other officers came in , including the " @entity166 , " a special force that provides " aggressive police presence " in areas with high drug use , the suit said , citing the @entity14 web site			2
many of the officers in that unit were wearing black , paramilitary - style clothing not immediately recognizable as police uniforms , the suit says			2
while lying on the floor , some people asked permission to move away from the broken glass and were told to " stay down and shut the [ expletive ] up , " the suit alleges			0
in all , they lay on the floor for 30 minutes to more than two hours , as they were released one by one or in small groups , the suit says			0
those who asked questions were also told to shut up , threatened with arrest for disorderly conduct or " threatened with violence and physical harm , " the suit says			0
" some were retaliated against by being forced to remain at the @entity13 long after they had been searched			2
" all persons at the @entity13 complied fully , promptly and peacefully with all demands made by the officers , no person at the @entity13 offered any physical resistance to the officers whatsoever , and none was charged with obstructing the officers in any way , " the suit says			1
police have said that if they go into a bar , it is procedure to have patrons lie on the floor and be searched , and everyone 's identification is taken and checked , @entity119 told reporters			1
" they did n't say this the night of the @entity13 raid ... this happened like a month later , " he said of the police comments			1
" they had plenty of time to figure out all the facts , and they knew they were going to be meeting with the media , and it was ultimately recorded , and they specifically went on record and said , ' this is what we always do , this is standard operating procedure , ' and that 's what makes this case so outlandish			0
" @entity2 's @entity237 and @entity238 contributed to this report .			0
