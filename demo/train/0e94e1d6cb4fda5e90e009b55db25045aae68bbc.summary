the @entity0 and @entity8 agreed that one policeman was among the dead and five officers were among the wounded			1
one eyewitness told the @entity53 that the blast could have been deadlier			2
" the march was delayed by 10 minutes , then just as people started to move , we saw the explosion go off just 100 meters away , to our left and on the road side			1
it seemed like the device was hidden in the snow near a tree , " @entity61 told the newspaper			2
" luckily a truck was maneuvering there , and it took most of the shrapnel			2
i saw two dead , lying in blood , just next to the truck , which was completely torn apart by metal shards			2
can you imagine if it had been later ? my wife and i went to the march with our baby daughter and our older son			2
" the explosion is a suspected terrorist act , said @entity85 , head of the @entity86 of @entity1 's @entity87			1

some 49 people died on february 20 , 2014 , and close to 100 more suffered gunshot wounds when , according to protesters , government snipers opened fire on them			0
two days later , president @entity107 fled the country , prompting @entity1 to declare " victory in the @entity95 " and promise a new day for a country long torn between its neighbors , @entity101 to the west and @entity15 to the east			0
@entity7 has been the target of numerous attacks in recent months			0
according to a @entity117 report , the @entity0 has declared that 700 separatists have been detained in the city , and several attacks have struck @entity1 's second - largest city since october			0
among them : a grenade attack on military warehouses on october 19 ; a november explosion at a pub popular with local volunteers and activists ; a @entity130 bombing at a furniture store ; a january bombing at a courthouse that injured 14 ; and a february bombing of a notary 's office			1
in response to the attacks , police have begun guarding @entity7 's " strategic infrastructure " and have upped security at supermarkets , @entity117 reported friday			1
sunday 's attack came a day after @entity146 secretary of state @entity145 , appearing in @entity144 , blasted @entity15 for its " land - grabbing in @entity1 " and threatened additional sanctions			0
" we are confident that over the next few days we are going to make it clear that we are not going to play this game , not going to sit here and be part of this extraordinarily craven behavior at the expense of the sovereignty and integrity of a nation , " he said			0
@entity158 has repeatedly denied that it is arming separatists and sending its own troops over the border , but @entity145 said satellites and other technology show it 's " no secret " what is happening in @entity1			0
" we know to a certainty what @entity15 has been providing to the separatists , how @entity15 is involved with the separatists , " he said			0
a ceasefire that went into effect february 15 remains in doubt , as a separatist offensive to take the key strategic town of @entity173 ended only wednesday when rebels took over the town			0
shelling also picked up last week in the city of @entity178 and clashes have been reported around the southern port city of @entity181			0

the ceasefire agreement -- signed february 12 in @entity192 , @entity193 , among the leaders of @entity1 , @entity15 , @entity195 and @entity196 -- aimed to curb this violence			0
it is supposed to be followed by the withdrawal of heavy weaponry to create a buffer zone , the release of prisoners and steps toward new elections			0
