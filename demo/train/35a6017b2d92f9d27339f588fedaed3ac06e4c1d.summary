-- five days ago , @entity1 was n't worried about a thing			2
and it was n't because he did n't have a reason to be			0
the pop star has been under investigation for alleged involvement in a january 9 egg attack on a neighbor 's home -- one that caused an estimated $ 20,000 in damages -- but you would n't know it from his tweets			0
after police raided his @entity17 , @entity18 , home and seized his security footage and @entity21 , @entity1 was on @entity22 sharing photos of a snowy vacation with friends			1
his carefree attitude was emphasized in an @entity22 post he captioned , " worried about nothing			0
' " while the media has been running in circles over allegations ranging from drug abuse to public urination , @entity1 's social life -- at least as depicted on his social media accounts -- never faltered			2
here 's a breakdown of how @entity1 's been spending his free time in the days leading up to his arrest : getting new ink @entity1 has gotten so many tattoos that they can make up their own guide			1
on january 12 he shared a photo of a freshly inked compass -- maybe he was feeling a little lost			0
@entity44 for the past week , we 've heard little from @entity1 that did n't include him hanging out with friends			1
@entity48 has it that the star has been thoroughly enjoying his break from concerts and work commitments			0
lounging ( sometimes shirtless , because why not ? ) nothing says wealth like a near - empty chest of drawers and a selfie taken in slippers -- at least , that 's how we 're interpreting this @entity22 post from five days ago			2
or maybe he 's trying to signal that his shorts were hanging a little low because of all the cash in his pockets ? the prior shirtless snapshot is a little easier to figure out -- the kid is always thinking of his fans			0
pranking friends no one knows whether it 's @entity1 's butt that 's mooning a snoozing @entity73 -- one of @entity75 's regular pals -- or someone else 's , but he did feel comfortable sharing the bro prank with the world			1
smoking @entity80 cigars and shooting hoops we know that @entity1 flew down to @entity83 on a monday , and the reports of what he 's being doing there -- aside from his recent arrest -- include spending $ 75,000 in a strip club			1
@entity1 has n't confirmed that bit of gossip , but we do know he 's recently lit up at least one @entity80 cigar and been to @entity93 's @entity83 - area skate park			1
tagging @entity1 's love for graffiti art has only increased in recent years -- and sometimes it gets him into trouble			2
yet it was n't tagging his initials that got him popped by the cops in @entity83 ... cruising in a @entity102 we all know how this turned out			0
but before the police arrived , @entity1 and his car companion -- who 's been identified as model @entity108 -- were captured enjoying a night drive , an image shared on @entity1 's friend @entity22 account			1
all of which leads up to the early hours of january 23 , when @entity1 was arrested on charges of drunken driving , resisting arrest and driving without a valid license			1
obviously , given the circumstances , we can imagine that the star wo n't be sharing any @entity122 updates for a while .			0

@entity1 was arrested in @entity83 , @entity125 , on january 23
in the week and a half leading up to his arrest , he 's been vacationing with friends
on @entity22 , he first shared photos of a snowy *getaway*
his friend @entity134 also posted photos of the two in @entity83
