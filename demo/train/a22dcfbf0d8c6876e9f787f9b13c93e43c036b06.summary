@entity0 -- @entity4 authorities monday arrested dozens of demonstrators in @entity6 as protests spread to the provincial capital and other cities in @entity10 despite tightened security and reports of martial law , activists told @entity1			1
" several hundred people , mostly students and ordinary @entity6 residents , gathered at @entity19 around 11 a.m. monday , chanting slogans and holding signs demanding legal rights for the @entity10 people , " said @entity14 , director of the @entity16 - based @entity15			1
" paramilitary troops dispersed the crowd after an hour and dozens were arrested			1
" sources in the city told him the protest turnout was much smaller than planned , @entity14 said , as officials sealed local campuses and shut down social media			2
he added that , in addition to @entity6 , the government has also deployed paramilitary troops into @entity36 , @entity37 and other cities , putting more areas in @entity10 under de facto martial law			1
local officials continue to dispute activists ' accounts , even as state - run media reported some conciliatory gestures by the government			2
" there was no protest in downtown @entity6 , " @entity47 , an official with @entity10 's foreign affairs office , told @entity1			1
" everything is normal and there is no martial law			2
" " all students are free to move around , " echoed @entity54 , a spokesman for the government of @entity57 prefecture			2
" journalists are welcome here , but you need to apply for permission first			0
" @entity57 is the site of one of the largest protests last week , as an estimated 2,000 @entity66 students took to the streets to show solidarity with a @entity66 herder , who was struck and killed by a @entity4 coal truck driver			1
in an unusual move , @entity10 's @entity73 chief visited the @entity57 area friday to meet with students and teachers , the @entity71 reported			1
@entity78 said authorities had detained the suspects in the herder 's death and promised swift punishment to those found responsible , according to the newspaper			0
the government has also sacked a top local official and pledged to better manage the mining industry to reduce its impact on herders ' livelihood			0
the @entity0 - based @entity92 , a mass - circulating tabloid , ran an editorial tuesday , calling some demands of " largely peaceful protesters " in @entity10 " reasonable " while accusing @entity97 media of exaggerating ethnic clashes in the region			1
activists acknowledge officials ' effort to calm tensions , but doubted their sincerity in resolving the dispute long term			0
they say the government 's push in recent years to expand coal mining in areas traditionally used for grazing has threatened the very existence of @entity66 herders and their culture			0
" officials just temporarily shut down a coal mine where the herder was killed , " @entity14 said			0
" @entity78 still stated development must go on , so they wo n't halt coal mining and production in the area forever			0
" the grassroots and peaceful nature of the @entity66 demonstrations has made it difficult for authorities to justify a harsh crackdown , he added , noting @entity0 's more heavy - handed responses in the past to protests by @entity132 and @entity134 muslims			2
" by carrying out this non-violent movement , @entity135 are gaining confidence in people power , in its ability to demand changes , " he said			0
the @entity4 government has hailed @entity10 as a " model autonomous region " with rapid economic growth -- spurred by the mining industry -- and ethnic harmony			1
with the recent unrest gaining international attention , @entity0 is playing down the ethnic dimension			0
" local authorities are trying to balance environmental protection and economic development , " @entity150 spokeswoman @entity149 commented tuesday on the herder 's death			0
" overseas parties who try to use this incident to stir up trouble have ulterior motives			0
" @entity135 have lived in the area for centuries , but the @entity163 -- who arrived in large numbers after the founding of the @entity167 in 1949 -- now make up almost 80 percent of @entity10 's population .			1
