@entity0 -- @entity2 walks briskly across a hospital lobby toward a group of high school students waiting to meet him			1
" welcome , " he said , panning their faces , " i work with gunshot patients			2
how many of you know somebody who 's been shot ? " hands spring up into the air from roughly half of the more than 20 students			2
without flinching , @entity2 continues his introduction			2
" what we 're going to do today is take you behind the scenes , pull back the curtain and let you see what we do in treating gunshot patients , " he said			2
it 's all part of the @entity28 program that @entity2 helped create to reduce violence in what is supposed to be the @entity0			1
inside @entity33 's trauma center , these high school students will relive the final minutes of life of a teenager who was killed by gun violence			1
among @entity39 's largest cities , @entity0 's homicide rate is the worst			1
guns are the weapons of choice , with more than 80 % of homicides committed with a firearm , according to the most recent police statistics			1
african - americans make up 85 % of the victims " statistics suggest that as a young , black man , you have a greater chance of being shot and killed in @entity0 than you would have if you were a soldier serving in the conflicts in @entity53 or @entity54 , " @entity2 said			1
" that 's absurd to me			2
" despite the daily gun violence plaguing @entity59 cities like @entity0 , @entity60 or @entity61 , it 's the mass shootings at a school or a theater or a public event -- like the tragedies in @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 -- that trigger outrage and a serious , nationwide discussion on gun violence			1
" the tragedy of the parents is n't greater in @entity67 than that of a parent of someone who was shot elsewhere , " @entity2 said , expressing sadness for the lives lost in the school shooting			1
" at the end of the day , their kids are n't coming home , and there 's no way to compare that anguish			2
" @entity67 has made us stare the ( gun ) issue in the face and ask ourselves if this is the price we 're willing to pay			1
" despite emotions , little happens legislatively after mass shootings ' white noise ' standing with students in a hallway leading to the hospital 's trauma bays and holding an @entity99 , @entity2 tells the story of 16 - year - old @entity101 , who was shot 24 times			1
" that young boy stood over @entity101 and fired 10 more shots into him , " he said , the sound of gunshots playing in the background			2
a few students gasp , while others stand stoically with hard - to - read expressions , as @entity2 leads them into the trauma bay			2
one by one , he places 24 red stickers on the body of a student volunteer lying on a gurney			0
" he had a bullet wound here ... @entity101 had a bullet wound right here ... @entity101 had a bullet wound right here , " @entity2 says , as he places each sticker on the student			0
across the @entity59 , more than 5,700 children and teens were killed by guns in 2008 and 2009 -- a number that would fill more than 200 public school classrooms -- according to data compiled by @entity127			1
that number includes 173 preschoolers , nearly double the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty during the same time			0
responding to last month 's @entity135 school shooting , president @entity133 created a task force led by vice president @entity137 charged with developing " concrete proposals " for dealing with gun violence no later than january			1
@entity133 exploring executive orders to combat gun violence among those serving on the vice president 's task force is @entity0 police commissioner @entity144 , whose city had a bloody start to the @entity147 with five homicides in the first 48 hours			1
@entity0 has seen a slow uptick in its homicide rate			1
last year , 331 people were the victims of homicides , up from 324 in 2011 and 306 the year before that			1
but last year 's toll marks a 15 % drop compared to 2007 , when the city earned the nickname " @entity158 " after suffering more than one murder a day			1
the fact that most of those killed in @entity0 are victims of gun violence is emblematic of a national trend : federal data for 2011 shows that more than 67 % of all homicides in the @entity59 were carried out with a gun			1
so where 's the nation 's outrage ? @entity172 , inner - city gun violence has become " white noise , " said @entity174 , founding director of center for the @entity175 at @entity176			1
" at this point it 's like , ' oh , another six people got shot and killed over a week in a poor black community			0
business as usual , ' " he said , shrugging his shoulders			0
" @entity39 says , if the urban communities do n't care enough about it , then why should we ? " @entity174 hopes that will change in the wake of the mass shooting in @entity67 , @entity135			1
" if this ( @entity67 ) is not enough for all of us to come together and say that something needs to be done , i do n't know what is , " he said			0
" our kids are dying and they 're leaving us way too soon , and we have the power to do something about that if we so choose			0
" a look at @entity59 gun laws ' i hurt the same way ' @entity203 , born and raised in the rough and tumble section of @entity205 on the southwest side of @entity60 , is no stranger to gun violence			1
@entity203 , who spent 14 years in prison for murder , is now on a mission to save lives			0
he is featured in the documentary " @entity216 , " which follows the lives of three community activists fighting to interrupt the fervent violence in @entity60			2
the shooting in @entity67 spurred the nation to respond , from prayer vigils and donations to around - the - clock news coverage of the event			2
although moving , the reaction was also sobering , @entity203 said			0
" a kid growing up in the ' hood has different expectations than a kid growing up in @entity67 , " said @entity203 , who works with ex-offenders at the faith - based nonprofit @entity225 in @entity60			0
" we have worldwide attention on this tragic event in @entity135 , but it shows us how we value life , and it 's a shame murder is n't treated the same across the board			2
" " i hurt the same way you hurt			0
murder should n't occur , and i say that as someone who took a life , " @entity203 said			0
" all lives are precious , and one is not worth more than the other			0
" every single day in the @entity59 , 13 young people between the ages of 10 and 24 are the victims of homicide , according to federal data			1
more than 80 % are killed with a firearm			1
in @entity0 , the majority of homicide victims are african - americans between the ages of 15 and 24			1
" every time there is a loss of life , we have to remind ourselves that these are often children			0
and we have to ask ourselves where have we failed to protect this child ? " said @entity259 , director of the @entity260 and @entity261 at @entity176			0
the indifference toward urban slayings often comes down to " victim blaming , " said @entity259 , author of " @entity267 , wrong time : @entity269 in the lives of @entity271			1
" " we 're using shorthand and stereotypes to draw a conclusion , " @entity259 said			0
" there 's something undeniably different when we have this scale of horrible in @entity135			0
and there 's something undeniably horrible about a killing a day			0
" trauma , poverty and unsafe neighborhoods must be included in the gun control debate , said @entity284 , co-director at the @entity260 and @entity261			2
both @entity259 and @entity284 want to explain the cycle of violence , not excuse it			2
as an emergency room physician , @entity284 said he regularly sees the carnage of gun violence , and added that it 's not enough to " treat them and street them			1
" " @entity296 people hurt people , " @entity284 said matter - of - factly			0
" it really is what 's perceived by society as what 's deserving			0
a veteran who has served our country deserves services , but the empathy is not there for young people who are chronically exposed to adversity			0
" " the assumption is that they 're bad kids , ( without ) giving society any responsibility , " he said			0
back at @entity33 , the students head from the trauma bay to a classroom for a discussion before they visit the hospital 's morgue , @entity101 's last stop			0
more than 7,000 students have come through the @entity28 program			0
@entity323 , the hospital 's chief trauma surgeon and a co-founder of the program , said she and @entity2 are committed because the cost of violence is too high			1
" i really think it 's our responsibility to prevent these kids from coming in			0
so as much as i may get frustrated on any evening , it really ca n't stop us , " @entity323 said			0
" we really want to teach them the preciousness of life , that in an instant your life can be changed forever			0

@entity0 has the worst homicide rates among large @entity59 cities
more than 80 % of homicides there are committed with a firearm
yet it takes a mass shooting to trigger attention to gun violence
indifference toward urban slayings comes down to " victim blaming , " says one author
