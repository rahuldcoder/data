-- they 're rich , powerful and @entity2 'd			0
one of them is bff with secretary of state @entity5			0
and they 're putting president @entity7 on notice : stop the @entity10 oil pipeline or else			1
or else what ? well it depends on who you ask			0
take @entity15 , for instance			0
she 's a major @entity18 fundraiser and co-founder of @entity21 clothing company			0
this is a woman who 's used to hosting political fundraisers and entertaining multimillionaires			0
she 's often described as one of @entity28 's closest friends -- donating to her 2008 presidential campaign			2
back then , she led a group of holdout @entity28 supporters before finally throwing her support to @entity7 after the ' 08 @entity18 convention			1
on tuesday , @entity15 could have been rubbing shoulders with the president at a swanky $ 5,000 - a - plate luncheon			0
instead , she joined an estimated 1,000 people out in the street protesting against the pipeline			2
" if he does n't oppose this , i certainly could not get behind him in a big way , " she said thursday			0
over the years , she guesses she has raised more than $ 1 million for @entity18 causes and candidates			0
will she be helping out @entity7 's re-election ? " i 'm doing fundraisers for several people coming up in the next few months , but the ( @entity7 campaign ) has n't asked me , and i have n't volunteered -- and i do n't know what 's to come , i really do n't			1
" @entity15 was n't the only rich and powerful political donor at tuesday 's demonstration			0
@entity53 , president and co-founder of @entity55 and @entity56 , was there , too			0
@entity7 's decision , he said , " will really be the clearest most unambiguous statement of whether or not he cares about protecting the @entity59 as he said in his campaign			1
" @entity10 is a proposed 1,700 - mile pipeline that would carry crude oil from @entity63 , @entity64 , to refineries in @entity66			1
environmentalists fear the pipeline will poison underground water supplies			2
pipeline operator @entity70 says the project would pose no threat , create jobs and spur the sagging economy			1
@entity7 has said the decision whether to begin pipeline construction rests with the @entity77 , but opponents say the final call is in the president 's hands			1
the administration 's decision is expected before the end of the year			0
@entity15 said she 's spoken about the @entity10 issue recently with her friend the secretary of state at a social gathering a few weeks ago			1
" she knows that it 's important for the people to speak out , " @entity15 said			0
in 2010 , @entity28 said the @entity77 had not yet completed its analysis of the pipeline 's environmental effects , but it was " inclined " to " sign off " on the project			2
at the demonstration @entity15 , who has seven grandchildren , held a poster that said , " another outraged grandmother against the pipeline			2
" " i do n't say that i know president @entity7 , but i 've had several conversations with him , " @entity15 said			1
" i feel that the environment is not a priority for him , and it should be			0
" @entity7 re-election campaign press secretary @entity105 would n't respond directly to @entity15 's comments , but he did offer a written statement that said , " the president has done more to wean us off of foreign oil and transition the nation to a clean energy economy than any other -- investing in renewable energy and high - speed rail , building a smart grid and reaching a historic agreement with the automakers on fuel economy standards that will save us from importing millions of barrels of oil from the @entity123			1
when @entity125 compare the president 's record promoting clean energy and @entity125 's energy security to those of the leading @entity132 candidates , who do n't even believe that climate change is an issue that we need to address and would cede the clean energy market to @entity137 , there will be no question about who will continue our progress			1
" political test the environmental community sees the @entity10 pipeline as more than a threat to water in the heartland			1
they see it as a political test of @entity7 's 2008 campaign promise to cut @entity125 dependence on polluting fossil fuels and to slow climate change			1
allowing the project to move forward , they say , makes a statement that the @entity157 is willing to bow to the wishes of the powerful oil industry			2
@entity53 's business has donated $ 5 million to groups that oppose the pipeline			2
a self - described " big and enthusiastic " @entity7 supporter in 2008 , @entity53 said he made $ 4,400 in personal donations to the president 's first campaign			1
he also was among 1,200 pipeline protesters who were arrested outside the @entity157 last summer			2
but @entity53 has n't given up hope			0
he still has a photo of himself with @entity7 hanging on his office wall			1
@entity172 environment adviser arrested in pipeline protest basically , he says , if the pipeline starts going , the money stops flowing			2
" i would still vote for him , and i would work to defeat his opponents , " @entity53 said , " but nothing more			0
" it 's not the first time disgruntled @entity18 have threatened to withhold their support for @entity7			1
during debt ceiling negotiations with @entity184 in july , the @entity182 demanded that the president press @entity184 to raise taxes on higher income earners and protect entitlements -- or else lose the committee 's support			0
members of the group threatened not to contribute to or volunteer for the president 's re-election campaign unless the @entity157 met its demands			0
last summer , the liberal group @entity197 , which supported @entity7 in 2008 , expressed frustration with the president over what it said was his inability to hold firm against @entity132 in debt ceiling battles and on environmental issues			1
environmentalists acknowledge the @entity157 has made some positive steps , including new vehicle fuel efficiency standards aimed at saving energy and cutting pollution			0
but if @entity7 allows @entity10 to go forward , they say there will be political repercussions			1
donors like it consultant @entity214 say the campaign will have a hard time motivating its base in an election where turnout may be critical			1
" even if the @entity220 says we should still go out and support the president , people will say , ' why should we do that when he did n't stand up for us when he really had the chance ? ' " in 2008 , ex-google software engineer and philanthropist @entity225 watched from the audience as @entity7 delivered his nomination acceptance speech promising to fight climate change and pollution			1
now @entity10 offers a chance for " @entity7 to do the right thing , and then give a great speech about how we need to stop investing in environmental degradation and nonrenewable energy sources and start investing instead in renewable energy , " @entity225 said			1
" then i would certainly be inspired to make a contribution			0
" protest organizers admit their message has been overshadowed somewhat by the nationwide @entity243 protests			0
but rather than compete for media attention , the two groups have been helping each other to some extent , joining forces at protests and offering moral support , organizers said			0
nonetheless , the @entity252 groups are preparing a new demonstration set for november 6 , a year before @entity254 , when thousands of pipeline opponents plan to form a human circle around the @entity157 .			2

campaign donors to @entity7 : stop oil pipeline
supporters say @entity10 pipeline is good for the economy
pipeline threatens *groundwater* , opponents say
