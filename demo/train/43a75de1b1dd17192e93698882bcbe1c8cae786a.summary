-- @entity1 says that after more than three years of a @entity4 presidency , the @entity2 is uncharacteristically pessimistic about the future of its children			1
the @entity9 presidential nominee said thursday at the @entity10 that @entity2 's immigrants would always arrive confident that they could build a better life , and " that in @entity2 their children would be more blessed than they			2
" " but today , four years from the excitement of the last election , for the first time , the majority of @entity2 now doubt that our children will have a better future , " @entity1 said			1
fact check : trimming the @entity23 the facts : polls do appear to show a recent , downward trend in optimism for kids ' futures , and four polls from two different organizations since 2009 indeed had a majority of adult respondents saying they do n't expect today 's children to be better off than their parents			1
but these results are n't unheard of			1
a poll also showed this type of result some 16 years ago			0
let 's start with the more recent surveys			0
consider this set of four @entity44 polls , from january 2009 to this year			0
january 2009 : 47 % said today 's children would n't be better off than their parents			2
october 2009 : 62 % said so			0
march 2011 : 60 % july 2012 : 65 % the question for the july 2012 @entity44 poll was : " will today 's children be better off than their parents ? " the national survey of 1,000 adults had an error margin of + / - 3 %			0
similarly , an april 2011 @entity52 / @entity51 poll had the pessimists in the majority , with 55 % saying it was either somewhat unlikely or very unlikely that " today 's youth " will have a better life than their parents			0
here 's how those @entity52 / @entity51 numbers looked from 2008 to 2011 ( sample of 1,013 adults , with a + / 4 % margin of error ) : february 2008 : 33 % somewhat / very unlikely december 2008 : 42 % march 2009 : 40 % january 2010 : 38 % october 2010 : 48 % april 2011 : 55 % @entity52 also keeps a collection of older , @entity67 / @entity66 poll results that used the same question : october 1996 : 42 % january 1998 : 34 % december 2001 : 27 % january 2003 : 31 % reports of majority pessimism , however , are not unique to the last three years			1
the @entity71 reported it in 1996 , and near - majority pessimism in 2002 and 2006			1
here are some @entity71 results : 1996 : 55 % said children will be worse off			1
1999 : 36 % 2002 : 50 % 2006 : 50 % the 2002/2006 @entity71 surveys asked : " when children today in the @entity2 grow up , do you think they will be better off or worse off than people are now ? " the 2006 survey polled 2,250 people and had a margin error of + / - 2 %			1
the 1996 and 1999 surveys asked : " looking to the future , do you think most children in this country will grow up to be better off or worse off than their parents			2
" conclusion : surveys in the past three years , from two different organizations , show the majority of respondents do n't expect today 's children to be better off than their parents			2
but a poll from a third organization also showed this level of attitude back in 1996			0
fact check : ' you did n't build that ' -- a theme out of context @entity0 's @entity102 and @entity103 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 says most @entity2 " for the first time " doubt that children will have better future than them
some polls indeed have shown this level of doubt since 2009
but majority pessimism is n't unheard of ; @entity71 recorded it in 1996
