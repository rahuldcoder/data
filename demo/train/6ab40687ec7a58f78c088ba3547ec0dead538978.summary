-- on the morning of august 5 , my uncle , @entity3 , and five other innocent people were gunned down in our place of worship , the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
the tragedy left us wondering what it will take to stem the growing tide of hate crimes and violence plaguing our nation			2
the @entity17 is holding a hearing on domestic terrorism on wednesday , and i hope it will do more than simply offer my community a chance to vent frustrations and appeal for sympathy			1
my hope is that the hearing provides an opportunity for @entity27 to come together and identify solutions			1
we need to be aware that the killings in @entity9 , as well as recent attacks on the mosque in @entity32 , @entity33 , and more than a dozen others across the country , will continue if we turn a blind eye to domestic terrorism			1
it is a significant , growing threat to our safety and freedom as @entity27			1
we must ensure our safety within our own borders before we can hope to address violence elsewhere			0
according to the @entity46 , between 1980 and 2001 , two - thirds of terrorist attacks in @entity27 were carried out by @entity48 @entity27 extremists			1
that rose to 95 % between 2002 and 2005			0
a recent study by the @entity51 found that non-islamic @entity27 citizens were behind 10 attacks from 9/11 through 2011 , while jihadists carried out four			1
during the same time , 11 white supremacist , anarchist or right - wing extremists were caught with biological or chemical weapons -- anthrax , cyanide , ricin or sarin -- and four attempted to acquire them			0
the study found not a single jihadist terrorist possessed or tried to acquire chemical or biological weapons			0
eleven years after 9/11 , who are the terrorists ? even more worrying is that radical right groups are growing explosively , according to the @entity69			1
yet appallingly , our government has not only failed to increase its efforts to monitor this threat , but in 2009 , it decreased efforts , leaving only one staffer in the @entity77 's domestic terrorism unit , according to @entity78 , a senior domestic terrorism analyst from 2004 to 2010			1
we know there are at least 1,018 domestic hate groups in the @entity27 today , many of which promote and explicitly call for violence against those of a different skin color , religion or ideology			1
how long can we keep our heads in the sand , and how long must we sit by as more innocent people die because a person decides that he wo n't tolerate the cultural or religious diversity of our nation -- our melting pot ? a coward killed my uncle			2
a coward , not because he went into a place of worship and took the lives of six unarmed people , and not because he took his own life rather than facing the consequences of his actions			0
he was a coward because he did n't have the courage to see the humanity of the people around him			0
he -- like all terrorists -- killed people because they were not like him , because they were different			2
the reality is we are all different from one another , and that means we are all potential targets for such violence			0
this problem affects each and every one of us , so it 's imperative that we act decisively , and act now			2
this is not a problem that is simply going to go away			0
the government agencies charged with defending our freedom and safety must make it a priority to fight terrorism not just abroad , but right here at home			1
and we as the citizens must rid ourselves of the hate speech and the xenophobia -- including @entity134 -- that divides us			0
this is particularly true of our leaders			0
opinion : what if @entity27 stops policing the world ? we can not give into the cowardice of prejudice			2
as the great @entity146 once said , " we are a nation of many nationalities , many races , many religions -- bound together by a single unity , the unity of freedom and equality			0
" together we can -- together we must -- address this challenge by calling on our elected officials to do their duty : defend the safety and freedom we as all @entity27 cherish			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			0
