-- october has been the deadliest month for the @entity2 and @entity3 militaries fighting in @entity4 as well as @entity6 workers trying to organize an election runoff			1
surely the surge in deaths serves to underscore why @entity4 matters			1
for all the debate happening away from the battlefield , here are a couple of important bottom - line questions : is the world prepared to see the @entity16 and their opportunistic allies @entity19 return to power in @entity4 ? are people prepared for the terrorists ' dream - photo - op of @entity24 and @entity25 sitting smiling together in @entity26 ? and here 's what 's at stake : the @entity30 fortunately has been free of terrorist attacks on its major cities in the last few years , but it was not so long ago that the @entity36 bombings ; mass murder in @entity38 ; mayhem in @entity40 in 2008 ; the murders of @entity42 and @entity43 ; the @entity45 bombing ; the shoe bomber and , of course , 9/11 and the attacks on the @entity49 changed our world and our way of life			1
together , those events created pervasive fear and anxiety , not to mention a change in our lifestyle caused by security measures in airports , trains , banking transactions and office buildings			2
what all of these events have in common is that the perpetrators all came from , visited , were financed by , or were led by terrorist organizations operating in @entity4 and @entity69 , especially the ungovernable territories on those countries ' border			1
the @entity76 administration , in the view of some , may have gone too far in responding to these events by creating an all - encompassing " war on terrorism			2
" however , for the eight long years @entity2 and @entity3 countries have been at war in @entity4 , this war , uniquely in modern history , is still supported by all the world 's major powers , the neighbors of @entity4 , and mostly by the people of @entity4 , who dread both insecurity and a return to the brutal horrors of the @entity16			1
if the threat of new terrorist attacks is not enough , what about the threat of a nuclear catastrophe ? look at @entity69 this week			0
horrific bombings in the frontier town of @entity99 and elsewhere have also killed scroes of people , just as @entity2 secretary of state @entity102 arrives to firm up security and development co-operation with that country			1
while foreign policy and intelligence experts continue to worry that terrorism , @entity111 extremism , the continued threat of renewed war between @entity69 and @entity114 , plus the presence of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries , could prove a combustible mix in the not - too - distant future			0
this is not scare - mongering ; it 's simply the reality that what happens in @entity125 could affect all of our lives			0
that 's why all of us must be concerned by the outcome of the war that is being fought today in mountains of the tribal areas in @entity69 and the plains of @entity4			1
many of the soldiers and officers i speak to in @entity4 say the best way to beat back the threat of @entity16 insurgents is with boots on the ground and additional military resources , as well as a proper development assistance for the @entity4 civilians			1
the @entity4 people need protecting and enabling			1
i have been reporting from @entity4 since 1996 and the one thing i 've noticed over the years is that every @entity4 asks foremost for security			2
then next on the list is development to help them earn a decent living and raise their families			0
they also want a decent government			0
they know this will take years of patience and effort			0
they know it will be a hard slog			0
after all , they have been at war for 30 years now , during which the traditional , honor - bound society they had for decades has all but vanished			0
though it is true that fierce tribal traditions mean some @entity4 distrust even the tribe next door , not to mention foreign troops , over and again , @entity4 men , women and children have told me they do not see the @entity2 and @entity3 forces as occupiers , rather as armies from countries who came to help them ... but who have fallen short of their promises			1
this fear and disenchantment is what the @entity16 feeds on today			2
they want the @entity2 and @entity3 out , they try to convince the people those outsiders are occupiers bent on harming them			1
and yet , if you look at the current trends and the latest polls in @entity4 , despite massive governmental corruption , abuse and dysfunction , the majority of the people want nothing to do with the @entity16			1
polls show only a tiny minority support them			0
and that is mostly because they are desperate for security and safety , something the @entity30 has failed to follow through on after roundly defeating the @entity16 and @entity19 in seven weeks after 9/11			1
and across the border in @entity69 surveys show @entity25 has lost his luster among @entity212 youth			0
support for @entity111 extremists is dropping			0
the @entity69 government is finally fighting back against the extremists who threaten the future of this mostly moderate @entity212 country			0
under pressure , the militants are lashing out in parts of the country			0
see @entity222 's special report on " @entity223 " unfortunately , at this crucial moment , people in @entity2 and @entity225 are tiring of their governments ' support for the war in @entity4 and the battles in remote parts of @entity69			1
the agonized debate over strategy in @entity234 hides the sad fact that since sending the @entity16 and @entity19 packing , shortsighted @entity2 vision snatched defeat from the jaws of victory			1
the @entity76 administration mostly ignored @entity4 while diverting its attention and resources to @entity244			2
now that the @entity2 is finally refocusing on the war in @entity4 it 's an opportunity to look at what is at stake : the urgency of finishing the job in @entity4 pitted against the real war - weariness of western voters			1
this is the dilemma of the modern world where the latest of life 's challenges such as the financial crisis , unemployment , new flu pandemics , health care , and the housing market dominate daily life			2
getting the job done in @entity4 will take years in time and resources			2
it will require faith and patience			0
the mass media is not the best place to reflect that			0
it does not usually focus on the hard slog , instead it is constantly in search of the new and the now			0
but the next time there is a major terrorist attack , in all likelihood it will have been generated by an organization somewhere near the border of @entity69 and @entity4			2
again , people will ask : why were n't our leaders and the media there to warn us of the dangers ? as a member of the media i believe that 's our job : to report the facts .			0
