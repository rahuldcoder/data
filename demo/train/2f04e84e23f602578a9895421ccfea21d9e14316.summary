@entity0 -- the @entity2 struggled tuesday , speaking in somber tones , when confronting one of its toughest criminal sentencing questions : whether two men convicted of killings committed when they were 14 deserve life in prison without the possibility of parole			1
the justices seemed to find little agreement on how young is too young in these rare instances , and whether it would be cruel and unusual punishment to forgo the chance that these now - adult inmates may someday be rehabilitated			1
" what 's the definition of a child ? " asked justice @entity19 , trying to draw a constitutionally acceptable line on mandatory sentences for underage murderers			1
" it seems to me some of the issues that we have suggested justify a different treatment of juveniles have to do with mental development , " said chief justice @entity26			1
" and those same issues would be taken into account by a jury in considering which of a list of offenses the juvenile should be convicted of			1
" the high court in 2005 banned the death penalty for those under 18 who commit aggravated murder			1
then , five years later , the justices said juveniles found guilty of non-homicides could not receive life without parole			0
now the spotlight turns on the youngest of killers and the question of whether a national consensus has developed to treat them differently regarding a lifetime of incarceration			1
the separate appeals involve an @entity57 boy who , with an accomplice , robbed a neighbor and then beat the man to death and set his house on fire ; and an @entity65 youth who was part of a group of teens who robbed a video store where the clerk was blasted to death with a shotgun			2
both were tried and convicted as adults and received the minimum sentences allowed under state law for felony capital murder			2
there are about 2,500 prisoners serving life sentences without parole for crimes committed as juveniles , at least 79 of whom are 14 years or younger , according to the @entity85 , which is representing the two men before the high court			1
attorney @entity88 urged the justices not to " give up " on child offenders , who he said are fundamentally different from adults			2
he said while they must be held accountable for their actions , youths are also works in progress , emotionally and developmentally			0
" these deficits in maturity and judgment and decision - making are not crime - specific			2
all children are encumbered with the same barriers that this court has found to be constitutionally relevant before imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole or the death penalty , " said @entity88 , who is based in @entity99 , @entity57			1
" these differences are even more pronounced in young children			0
" justice @entity110 jumped in			2
" once you depart from the principle that we 've enunciated that ( the ) death ( penalty ) is different , why is life without parole categorically different from 60 years or 70 years ? you 'd be back here next term ( challenging ) a 60 - year sentence			1
" he wondered aloud whether it would be fair to argue 14 - year - olds deserve less time behind bars than a 15 - year - old			1
@entity88 said firmly all those under 18 at the time of their crimes deserve the chance for parole someday			2
he said the often - terrible facts of a murder can overwhelm any mitigating factors like a defendant 's age , especially for jurors who may be unaware that a young person 's brain development , living environment and self - control are often not complete			1
" you would say that a person of 17 years and 11 months , who commits the worst possible string of offenses -- and demonstrates great maturity -- still can not be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole ? " asked @entity19 , sounding skeptical			1
" what justifies an absolute ban at a certain age and a modified ban above an age ? " added justice @entity150			1
@entity110 said 39 states allow juveniles to receive life without parole for certain murder offenses			0
" the @entity161 people have decided that that 's the rule			2
and the federal government allows it			0
so i 'm supposed to impose my judgment on what seems to be a consensus of the @entity161 people ? " later , the @entity57 solicitor general said states deserve discretion to set punishments for the worst of offenders , even teenagers			0
" the government 's primary goal here is expressing the retributive judgment about the wrongfulness of murder and why it 's different , " said @entity176 " they do n't want to roll the dice on convicted murderers			1
society acts with particular revulsion when a convicted murderer commits a crime again " after being released from custody , he said			2
" how do you go back to justifying , " said justice @entity193 , " the mandatory nature of life imprisonment without parole , given that not every juvenile is equal and not every murder is equal with respect to them ? " justice @entity200 pressed the question further , asking , " what 's the minimum age , in your opinion , or is there any constitutional minimum at all in respect to which you could give " life without parole to a young killer			1
" i mean , you could have an instance of a 10 - year - old or an 8 - year - old			1
i mean , is it totally up to the states , or is there a minimum ? " @entity200 said			0
@entity176 ran into trouble when backed into this legal corner , suggesting , " if i were the state up here trying to defend a 12 - year - old ( getting life without parole ) , i would argue that that was the line			1
so a 12 - year - old -- well , no -- well , yes , " he finally decided			1
" do you see the difficulty ? all right			0
so now put yourself in my position , " responded @entity200			0
" do you want to say 12 ? do you want to say 10 ? do you want to say 9 ? because as soon as whatever you say , i 'm going to say : and why not 14 ? " he added			2
justice @entity228 -- as he has in many divided cases -- may prove to be the deciding vote			2
but he seemed troubled about articulating an appropriate age limit			2
" now , we have some quite compelling stories of rehabilitation in this case			0
i do n't know if they 're isolated ; i do n't know where they are in the statistical universe of how often rehabilitation is demonstrated and is real			0
what do i look at ? what 's a judge supposed to do ? " he asked @entity88			1
" you 're just forcing us into a bipolar position			0
we 're either going to say that you ca n't prevail at all or that everyone under 18 can not get life without parole			0
i do n't see this middle course			0
" complicating matters , several justices noted differences between the two cases before them			0
@entity176 noted the murder committed by @entity257 in @entity57 was especially " gruesome			0
" the boy and his accomplice had smoked marijuana with the victim in his trailer			0
the 52 - year - old man burned to death after the mobile home was set ablaze			1
in @entity267 's case , he was originally outside as a lookout when the @entity270 , @entity65 , robbery took place			0
it was a 15 - year - old boy who shot the female clerk when she refused to turn over money			1
the actual shooter later pleaded guilty and received life with the possibility of parole			0
@entity88 said there was a real question whether @entity267 had an " intent to kill " during the botched robbery , perhaps allowing for a lesser sentence			0
but the @entity65 assistant attorney general said the sentence of life without parole was still appropriate , arguing the defendant could have received the death penalty if he had been an adult at the time of the crime			1
" a legislative judgment has been made with regard to drawing a baseline for all murderers , whether they are juvenile murderers , whether they are getaway drivers , " said @entity293			0
" and when you counsel or aid or do anything that gets you liability for being a capital murderer , then that is the minimum sentence " -- life without parole , with no exceptions			0
the cases are @entity257 v. @entity57 ( 10 - 9646 ) and @entity267 v. @entity309 ( 10 - 9647 )			0
rulings are expected within the next three months .			0
