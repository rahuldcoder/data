@entity15 is a half - sweet and fruity red wine , low in tannins			2
my @entity14 mother , whose family once owned vineyards in the area , would bring me here amid the musty aroma of oak barrels and the waft of red onions on zsiros kenyer -- bread topped with lard , onion and paprika			2
the wine would be decanted unceremoniously into a huge two - liter recycled @entity34 bottle			2
' not the rubbish you get in supermarkets ' for her , the wine in the @entity39 recalled her student days in the city 's college and her family 's connection with the area			1
" your grandfather made white wine like this , " she said when tasting a glass of @entity48 , another local favorite			2
" this is proper cellar wine , not the rubbish you get in the supermarkets			2
" they take wine very seriously in this part of northeastern @entity14 , close to the edge of the @entity61			1

among them is @entity114 , a golden wine produced in @entity65 's @entity117 district that carries the aroma of linden flowers and a rich sweetness			1
others include @entity97 ( better known as the anti-vampiric " bull 's blood " )			0
synonymous with @entity65 , @entity97 is one of @entity14 's most famous red wines , known for its ruby color and spicy notes			1
the wine comprises a blend of at least three of 17 red grape types from the @entity65 district			1
it varies between wineries , but the @entity134 grape , supposedly brought over during the @entity73 occupation , often anchors it			0
@entity137 and its more than 200 wine cellars are easily reached from the center of @entity65 via the miniature train that departs from @entity142			1
each cellar has its own distinct flavor			0
the ones located at the base of the valley pulse at night from local activity and live gypsy music , while others are more spartan , pulling in the crowds with quality wine			0
the @entity153 , at number 19 , is by far the most spectacular , a cathedral to wine carved under the hill			0
it 's worth visiting for the architecture alone , or for its pince lepeny , a buckwheat pancake filled with ham and cheese -- perfect to soak up the alcohol			0
and , of course , at the top of the hill , at number 28 - 29 , there 's the @entity5			0
these days there 's no need to bring your own recycled @entity34 bottle			0
