-- a transsexual woman has won on appeal the right to marry her boyfriend , a decision poised to rewrite @entity7 's marriage law			1
the appellant -- known only by the initial " w " -- is a post-operative male - to - female transsexual who was refused the right to marry because she did not quality as a " woman " under @entity7 law			1
the @entity14 ruled 4 - 1 monday that the restriction was unconstitutional			0
the 37 - year - old woman -- who had a government - subsidized sex change operation -- had twice lost her case at lower courts			1
" i may have born a man but after transgender surgery at a government hospital more than five years ago , i 've lived my life as a woman and been treated as a woman in all respects except as regards my right to marry , " @entity9 said in a statement to local reporters through her attorney , @entity23 , according to the @entity24			1
" this decision rights that wrong , and i 'm very happy the court of [ final ] appeal now recognizes my desire to marry my boyfriend one day , and that desire is no different to that of any other woman who seeks the same here in @entity7			2
" the court decision will not come into effect for 12 months to give the @entity7 legislature the opportunity to address the portion of the law deemed unconstitutional			0
" we should make it clear that nothing in this judgment is intended to address the question of same sex marriage , " chief justice @entity47 and judge @entity48 wrote in their majority decision			2
