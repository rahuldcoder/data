regardless of how the @entity1 rules on health care reform , the justices have one thing in common , and one thing in common with a growing cohort of @entity6 : they are aging			1
@entity6 faces an unprecedented wave of aging as members of the iconic baby boomer generation turn 65			0
this year alone , 4 million @entity6 will join the growing ranks of senior citizens			1
the @entity14 strengthened the @entity16 system that this growing senior population relies on			2
health care reform reduces the cost of prescription drugs , brings down costs for patients using private @entity16 supplements and increases access to free preventative services			2
the @entity14 makes health care more affordable for senior citizens and ensures that doctors are compensated fairly for their services			1
while @entity16 certainly needs adjusting , if the law is overturned , the challenges of @entity16 financing will only get worse			0
for the millions of senior citizens and about - to - be seniors in @entity6 the improvements brought by health care reform are just an important first step			1
we must protect the progress made by the @entity14 , but much more is needed to support our rapidly growing older adult population to help them live independently , at home and in our communities with dignity			2
a vital home care work force has developed to meet these needs , and its interests are inextricably bound to the future of health care			1
the average hourly wage of a home care worker in the @entity6 is less than $ 10 per hour			2
poverty wages and a lack of benefits , training and career pathways mean turnover is constant			0
the work force can barely meet the current need for care , supports and services , let alone what 's to come			0
more families are turning to immigrant women of color to provide care for their loved ones			0
these women work tirelessly to feed and bathe our nation 's senior citizens , serve as a go - between with family and doctors , count medication , even take care of pets , and yet they are denied basic wages , let alone benefits , worker protections and pathways to citizenship			1
in fact , one out of two direct care workers supplements his or her income with food stamps , @entity92 or public benefits , compounding our overall challenge			0
news explainer : health care 's big four issues : what the justices are tackling we need to create more jobs in @entity6 , address the need for home care , and improve the quality of care jobs all at the same time			1
in so doing , we can create precisely the type of economic growth we need in this moment			0
these are issues that concern us all including , ultimately , @entity1 justices			2
of course , the @entity1 justices have lifetime appointments that include access to the @entity114 , one of the largest insurance pools in the country , which ensures the jurists are n't subject to the sorts of limits for pre-existing conditions and inflated premiums that most insured @entity6 have long faced			1
and if they choose to leave the bench , the justices can opt to keep their coverage -- meaning they wo n't have to rely on @entity16 to nearly the extent most elder @entity6 do			0
news : timeline of the health care law but someday , they may want an in - home care worker to help them through the challenges of aging			1
the @entity14 was a great leap forward in improving a health care system that is n't working well for senior citizens , workers or any of us			1
with our senior population growing by the second , or every eight seconds to be exact , we need to move forward quickly toward more improvements , not roll back the ones we 've made			0
according to polls , the @entity6 people know that the @entity1 wo n't rule based on the @entity149 alone			0
politics clearly influence such decisions			0
but if the justices would just think of themselves as senior citizens and soon - to - be - seniors , they would uphold the @entity14 for the sake of older @entity6 , care workers and our shared future			1
@entity158 : the real people behind health care reform			0

@entity162 : like the rest of us , @entity1 justices are aging , will need good health care
she says @entity14 improves *availability* , costs of care for senior citizens
she says home care workers a growing need as boomers age , but wages and protections *lag*
*writer* : @entity6 should *foster* and value home care workers ; even justices may need them one day
