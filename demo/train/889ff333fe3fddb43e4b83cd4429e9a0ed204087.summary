@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's become a daily routine for @entity1 living near @entity5 : a casual conversation interrupted by an air - raid siren , then a furious rush to find cover , and finally -- if all goes well -- a flash in the sky indicating an incoming rocket has been intercepted			1
while @entity1 are protected by the relatively new @entity15 missile interceptor system , it has n't abated the fear that one of the dozens of rockets fired from @entity19 - controlled @entity5 into @entity1 in recent days will strike nearby			1
more details on @entity15 schools and businesses in southern @entity1 near the @entity24 territory of @entity5 are closed , as @entity19 militants and the @entity1 military mull their next move			1
just a few miles from @entity5 in the southern @entity1 city of @entity0 -- which has been repeatedly targeted by militants in recent days -- @entity29 and @entity30 decided to move their family into their parents ' apartment building to protect their three kids from incoming rocket strikes			1
" it ( has ) a safe room , it 's got thicker walls and it 's more or less blast resistant , " explained @entity38			0
his two daughters pass the time on their grandparents ' sofa , reading books and drawing flowers and colorful butterflies			2
the monotony is constantly interrupted by the sound of explosions outside			0
@entity38 says it 's unclear if the rocket landed or if it was intercepted			2
victims in @entity5 too young to understand either way , the fear is the same			1
" it 's really frightening especially when we 're in school and hear a ' boom ' and there 's bombing , " said 11 - year - old @entity58			2
wedged between a crowded bookcase and the metal door to the apartment 's small safe room is pile of cushions and blankets heaped on the floor			2
that 's where all three children will sleep for the foreseeable future			0
the @entity78 , like many other @entity1 families , are taking no chances that their family will be protected by the @entity15 -- which has shot down approximately half of the nearly 600 rockets that have struck @entity1 since the conflict began wednesday			1
" we ca n't go on like this , " said @entity0 mayor @entity83 , who drives the streets of his city checking on residents			1
" we have 131,000 people here and 26,000 children			0
they are constantly under threat			0
" @entity93 , who was playing backgammon at a pizza place downtown , echoed the mayor 's thoughts			0
" they do n't want peace , " said @entity93 , speaking of the people in @entity5			1
" how would you feel if your children were constantly scared ? " the city 's residents have experience dealing with how to quickly move to air raid shelters and some , like @entity93 , have a " @entity111 " app for their smart phones that tracks rocket attacks			0
@entity1 and @entity19 : how the conflict reignited " we do n't want war but there are people all the time shooting at @entity1 and we are quiet -- we stay quiet -- and the world does n't see the truth , " @entity93 said			1
and it 's not just in southern @entity1 where nerves are frayed			2
in @entity122 -- some 50 miles away from @entity5 -- sirens went off on a calm friday evening , startling @entity124 who sent video to @entity126			1
@entity124 said people ran for safety -- most apartments in @entity122 are equipped with bomb shelters -- and later , the distant sound of a rocket exploding could be heard			1
" you feel very vulnerable and you 're really not sure where to go , because you do n't know where they will land , " he told @entity2			0
" i 'm a @entity137 , so we do a lot of praying			0
" in @entity1 's second most populous city , @entity140 , life was relatively normal last week as explosions could be heard from the current conflict			1
" @entity140 is quite in a routine mode			2
there 's no panic , but the streets are half empty , " explained @entity145 , who submitted photos to @entity126			0
" many are in their homes			0
there is tension over the city and many are confused			0
" many still do n't know what to do in case of an attack			0
" @entity159 reported from @entity0 and @entity160 from @entity161 .			2
