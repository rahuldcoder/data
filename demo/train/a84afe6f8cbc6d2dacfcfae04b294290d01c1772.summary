-- when you 're shopping for an ipad 2 , you have a dozen configurations to choose from , and some recent discoveries will make this decision much easier for you			1
to configure your ipad 2 , you have 12 options as you decide on color , storage and , most importantly , data connection -- @entity11 , or @entity12 - only			1
it turns out that if you 're one of the millions of people who own an @entity16 phone or an @entity17 , you do n't need a 3g model , which will save you a big chunk of cash			1
smartphone hotspots the most recent @entity22 ( the @entity23 and the @entity17 , when upgraded to the latest version of @entity25 ) and the vast majority of @entity16 smartphones now officially support wireless - hotspot capability , which turns the handset into a @entity12 connection that can be shared with multiple devices , including the ipad 2			1
more on tablets and e-readers from @entity0 so if you go with a @entity12 - only model and you want to hop on a cellular connection , you can activate the hotspot option on your smartphone through your carrier , pay $ 20 per month and connect the @entity32 to that			1
that 's not as seamless as having @entity11 built into the @entity32 , but it will save you the extra $ 130 you 'd plunk down on a 3g model			1
plus , you 'd have to pay at least $ 15 a month just to use an @entity32 's 3g connection anyway			0
jailbreaking for free hotspots if you 're down with getting a little dirty , you can use your @entity16 phone or @entity17 as a hotspot without paying monthly fees by hacking your device			1
for @entity16 phones , you just have to root ( aka jailbreak ) the device with a tool called @entity55			0
for rooted @entity16 phones , there are unauthorized apps called @entity59 and @entity60 , which offer free hotspot utilities			2
you can also flash your device and install @entity63 , a different @entity16 skin that includes a built - in hotspot feature			1
for the @entity17 , all you have to do is jailbreak with any of the tools out there			0
( @entity70 note that if you do update to the latest version of @entity25 , you ca n't jailbreak yet			0
) jailbreaking will install the @entity74 app , which gives you access to the underground @entity74 app store			0
there , you can download the unauthorized app @entity77 , which costs a one - time fee of $ 20 , and does n't charge you monthly			0
@entity81 transplant the @entity12 @entity32 does n't have built - in @entity81 , but if you want to use that beautiful @entity83 app for navigation , you still do n't need a @entity85 , so long as you have an @entity17			2
it turns out that if you hotspot with an @entity17 , the connection transfers the gps to the @entity32			2
just connect the @entity32 to the @entity17 's hotspot , then launch the @entity83 app , and you 'll see the blue dot tracking your location			0
( we 're not sure if this works when hotspotting with an @entity16 phone -- if you can confirm , let us know in the comments			1
) @entity98 another surprise is that if you turn your smartphone into a wireless hotspot , you can connect to it with your @entity32 and use @entity98 videoconferencing			0
that 's interesting because typically you ca n't use @entity98 over a @entity107 connection ; it 's supposed to only work on a @entity12 connection			0
because a hotspot shows up as a @entity12 connection , you 're basically tricking the @entity32 2 into using a 3g connection for @entity98			2
