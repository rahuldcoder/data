editor 's note : @entity2 is executive director of the @entity4 @entity3 , a nonprofit organization that seeks to protect people 's rights			1
a lawyer from @entity8 , he was educated there , in @entity9 and at @entity10			0
@entity2 says conviction of @entity13 's ex-president is a warning to those who deny human rights			1
( @entity17 ) -- @entity13 are celebrating an extraordinary victory this week : the conviction of their former president , @entity20 , for death squad killings carried out during his rule in the 1990s			1
the @entity13 @entity23 found him guilty of egregious human rights abuses , including the massacre of innocent civilians , and sentenced him to 25 years in prison -- a stiff message to other leaders that justice can eventually catch up to even the most powerful			1
it is one of the first times a nation 's own independent courts have convicted a former leader for such serious human rights crimes and it sets an important precedent for a region that suffered so much from political violence and rights violations			1
equally significant , the ruling came after a lengthy televised trial , which was clearly fair to the defendant -- despite @entity13 's previous history of authoritarianism and weak rule of law			2
@entity20 came to office in 1990 on the promise of crushing a vicious @entity54 insurgency but , in the process of restoring order , he corrupted and weakened @entity13 's most vital government institutions -- including parliament , the courts and law enforcement			1
just a few years ago , @entity20 had near - total control of @entity13 's judiciary			1
for a decade , his government used bribery , extortion , and intimidation to concentrate power in the presidency , subverting the democratic process and eliminating normal checks by the judiciary , legislature , and media on government abuses			0
he led @entity13 from 1990 to 2000 , presiding over the war with the @entity77 guerrillas and the @entity78			2
he was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads			1
@entity20 is to be tried separately on multiple corruption charges			2
the landmark decision fits within a global trend of increasing accountability for former heads of state			0
just 20 years ago , it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book			2
in the late 20th century , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , to name just a few , were never brought to trial			0
since then , however , the tide has turned			0
in october 1998 , @entity100 police arrested general @entity101 on a warrant from a @entity9 judge for human rights crimes			1
the arrest and the subsequent decisions by the @entity107 to reject @entity101 's claim of immunity were a wake - up call to tyrants everywhere , but more important , they gave hope to victims elsewhere that they too could bring their tormentors to justice			2
in country after country , particularly in @entity118 , victims were inspired to challenge the amnesty laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and , often , to remain in power			0
thanks to these efforts , former leaders in @entity127 , and @entity128 have also faced human rights trials			1
@entity101 's arrest also strengthened a nascent international movement -- spurred by the killings in @entity133 and @entity134 , and facilitated by the end of the @entity136 -- to make certain the worst abuses are punished			0
after the creation of @entity141 tribunals for the former @entity142 and @entity134 , the world established the @entity143 ( @entity143 ) to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so			0
the @entity143 is now investigating crimes in the @entity150 , @entity151 and the @entity152 , and in march the court indicted president @entity154 of @entity155 on charges of crimes against humanity in @entity158			0
the @entity20 case stands out , though , because it was @entity13 's national court system which demonstrated the will , capacity , and independence to try its former president			1
a second panel of the @entity23 will now review an appeal by @entity20			0
one can hope the second panel will be as transparent and fair as the first			0
even after this verdict , impunity for past atrocities continues to be a major problem in @entity13 and throughout the region			2
it is likely , however , that yesterday 's verdict will help give momentum to efforts currently underway in many @entity118 countries to bring other human rights violators to justice			1
the verdict will also send a powerful message to current heads of state who may be tempted to use abusive tactics to resolve their political problems			0
as @entity20 discovered yesterday , crimes they may be able to get away with while in power can come back to haunt them years later			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity13 court verdict in @entity20 case sends strong message
@entity20 was convicted for allowing death squads to murder innocents
since @entity101 case , @entity199 says , courts have been holding leaders accountable
@entity199 : leaders who deny human rights may suffer for it years later
