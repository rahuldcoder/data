-- a video of a frail and unamused looking @entity2 surrounded by @entity4 president @entity3 and other officials has prompted cries of political exploitation by the government			1
in the footage released by the @entity10 , the 94 - year - old @entity2 sits in a chair at his @entity13 home , barely moving and never smiling as leaders from the governing @entity15 arrange themselves for a photo opportunity			1
at one point @entity2 's grandson takes a picture with flash , causing him to close his eyes and purse his lips			2
the former president is sensitive to flash photography from his years laboring in quarries during his imprisonment under the country 's apartheid government			0
@entity3 says @entity2 is in " good shape , " but the footage seems to show him looking anything but -- and the stunt provoked outrage from many in @entity4 who accused the @entity15 and @entity10 of parading the country 's anti-apartheid hero on television for their own benefit			1
" very sad seeing the footage of @entity2			2
and who was the idiot who took a pic of him with a flash ? disgraceful			0
leave him alone " , tweeted @entity13 radio dj @entity44 , using the clan name by which @entity2 is widely referred to in @entity4			1
another @entity48 user , @entity47 , wrote : " after everything @entity2 has done for us this is how they treat him			2
like an animal at the zoo			0
shame on the @entity15 ! " " [ a ] fter months of attacking media for ' invading ' @entity2 's privacy , @entity15 today released an invasive video of a clearly ailing and grim @entity2 , " tweeted journalist @entity55			1
one @entity13 radio station wrote : " the way # @entity2 was paraded on @entity61 this evening was horrible ! grotesque ' journalism '			1
all involved should hang their heads in shame ! " @entity2 endured 27 years in prison before becoming the country 's first black president in 1994			2
he has become increasingly frail over the years and has been hospitalized three times in the past five months , most recently for a lung infection in march			0
the @entity15 may have been critical of the media in the past for not respecting @entity2 's privacy since his withdrawal from public life , but the party rejected any criticism of monday 's house call			1
" the @entity15 has noted the determined efforts by some sections of our society to degrade the visit of the @entity86 to comrade @entity2 , " party spokesman @entity79 said in a statement			1
@entity79 said the visit " was in line with the accepted norms of @entity89 that we value our elderly , " and the party " stands by its statements that president @entity2 is in good health and in good spirits			2
" " @entity4 are called upon to appreciate that @entity2 is 94 years old ; he will thus be frail and not as active and energetic as we all fondly remember him			1
there is no reason to be alarmed by the visuals of an elderly person who clearly is receiving the necessary care and attention			0
" @entity55 countered on @entity48 : " @entity15 misses point			2
@entity105 was because of its political exploitation of @entity2 ; not because of ' fear ' of the images			0
" another user , @entity109 , wrote : " [ @entity110 ] he # @entity15 has no compunction about using a 94 year old frail man to canvass for votes - anything for nostalgia			1
" the video released monday was the first of the former leader since his birthday last july			0
@entity2 , a @entity120 winner , has a history of lung problems dating back to when he was a political prisoner on @entity124 during apartheid			0
he contracted tuberculosis during his imprisonment			0
he underwent treatment for a lung infection and had surgery to remove gallstones over the @entity133 holiday in 2012 , one of his longest hospital stays since his release from prison in 1990			0
@entity138 and @entity139 contributed to this report .			0
