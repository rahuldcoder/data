-- @entity1 was a bit of a travel late bloomer , but the " @entity5 " host has more than made up for lost time			1
born and raised in @entity7 , @entity8 , " i was never a foreign exchange student and did n't even have a passport until ' @entity5 , ' " says @entity1 , 52			1
the show has been " a life - changing experience			1
" since the competitive reality series debuted on @entity18 in 2000 , the @entity15 - winning host and executive producer has n't stopped traveling all over the world			1
" i 've been underwater at 60 feet with a shark and found myself sitting out in an @entity22 game reserve with zebras running past me , " says @entity1			1
" i really began to understand simultaneously how unique i am and how i 'm one grain of sand in this giant beach we live on			1
it really did help shape me			1
" the 28th " @entity5 " season finale airs live on wednesday , may 21			1
the cast and crew work hard , shooting two seasons of the @entity18 series over 78 days of the 95 days they 're on location			1
anytime there 's a break , " we play hard , " says @entity1			1
and where they get to play is pretty spectacular			1
@entity1 shared his top 10 favorite spots in the world with @entity0 , some of which are places the show took him			1
@entity49 anytime he had a break during shooting " @entity5 " seasons 10 and 16 on @entity49 , an island nation in the western @entity51 , @entity1 headed to the water to scuba dive			1
" of all the places we traveled , if you 're into ocean and scuba diving or just snorkeling , it 's one of the greatest spots in the world , " he says			1
@entity62 , a popular ( and advanced ) diving spot where you can descend at least 20 feet and clip onto a rock , is a favorite dive			1
" you do n't go anywhere , " he says			1
" the entire sea world goes past you , and it 's the most amazing aquarium in the world			1
" another favorite spot is @entity74 , the home of hundreds of thousands of jellyfish that have lost the need to sting because they do n't have to fight predators			1
" you 're swimming with these jellyfish , and it 's like being on a psychedelic trip , " he says			1
@entity86 stargazing and waking up to wildlife outside his tent at the @entity90 in @entity86 were two of @entity1 's favorite memories of season three			1
" you 've never seen stars like you see in @entity22 , " he says			1
" there 's no ambient light ... when you really see what 's up there , it 's mind - blowing			1
" he 'd head back into his tent to sleep			1
come morning , he would open his tent zipper one click at a time			2
" you did n't want to scare off the wildlife that you hoped was waiting outside your tent			2
it was not uncommon to find zebra and giraffes			2
" " a lion chased a zebra through our protective fence into camp and killed the zebra , and two other lions came to help with the kill , " he says			2
@entity119 looking for a remote desert island ? " @entity5 " location scouts found a perfect spot in the @entity119 in the @entity123 for season 13			1
the @entity126 culture of the islands celebrates the sea and offers a relaxed way of life			2
known especially for coral reef lagoons , kayaking and beaches , the islands also offered @entity1 and the crew a chance to know the locals			2
" the majority of our crew lived with local families			2
you could eat ( at work ) or you could eat with them			2
" @entity1 picked up a bit of the relaxed local attitude			2
" you ca n't help but be impacted by a different lifestyle			2
you do realize there are lots of ways to live			2
" @entity152 's best new skyscraper is ... 4			2
@entity153 , @entity154 formerly a retreat for @entity157 royalty , @entity153 is now the @entity1 family 's vacation spot during spring break			1
that 's because @entity1 married @entity162 , who had two children from a previous marriage , in 2011			2
they all often head to @entity153 when the children , @entity167 , 10 , and @entity168 , 7 , are on spring break			2
" there 's something about @entity153 , " he says			2
" i feel so at home and grounded and connected to the earth ( there )			2
i love the weather and the water			2
@entity162 and i have talked about if we ever lived somewhere else , this would be the place			0
@entity179 , @entity180 every season in the @entity179 , it rains so much that the water levels rise and drop by 40 feet in a matter of weeks , says @entity1			0
the season six crew stayed at the @entity187 , a hotel built on stilts			0
when they arrived , there was no water around the hotel			0
during the shoot , it rained so much they ended up surrounded by water , by design			0
@entity1 says the @entity179 is the spookiest place he has been , and not just because of his childhood fear of crocodiles			0
" there are more insects and snakes and weird animals -- i did n't know what they wereâ € ” than i 've ever seen before			0
and there are piranha in the water			0
" and those crocodiles ? traveling to the @entity211 -- the ceremony where players are eliminated -- required traveling down a river in a skinny , motor - equipped canoe			0
" we would take these canoes , and i 'd shine a flashlight on the shore and see pairs of red ( crocodile ) eyes dotting it , " he says			0
" i 'd be almost petrified the canoe would tip over			0
" do n't worry about him , though			0
" i like being out of my comfort zone , " he says			0
" i do n't know that i would ever visit again , but it 's on the kids ' bucket list			0
" that means he 'll probably be back			0
@entity232 outback " @entity5 " season two took the cast and crew into the outback , where @entity1 often woke to a family of kangaroos outside his tent			1
" we think of them as friendly , but know they are lethal and massive , " he says			0
" one could literally kill me with one kick to my head while yawning			0
" absorbing a bit of @entity232 culture , @entity1 also returned home to @entity247 worrying less about everything			1
" @entity232 have a different way of living : ' no worries ' comes from a place of truth			1
they do n't worry nearly as much about things as we do			0
" " it 's had the greatest impact on my life , how i raise my kids and how the show works , " he says			0
" anyone who has hung out in @entity232 knows what i mean			1
of course i care and am competitive , but i am also going to do it while tossing back a beer			0
" weirdest rock formations around the @entity267 7			0
@entity268 , @entity269 growing up in @entity8 , @entity1 's family piled into the family station wagon for an annual ski vacation in @entity268 , @entity269			1
there 's something about the @entity275 that 's completely familiar to him , down to the expressions on his parents ' faces as they waited in line to rent skis			0
" our parents did that trip every year , and i can remember my dad telling me years later that family adventures and vacations are a lot of work ... but they are never not worth it , " @entity1 says			0
" i can remember all the times we loaded up in our station wagon to drive through the snow - covered mountains so we could have family vacations			0
@entity295 , @entity296 when @entity1 performed his parents ' vow renewal ceremony for their 50th anniversary in @entity296 in 2009 , he had no idea he 'd be returning for a similarly important event two years later			0
that 's when he flew @entity162 and her children to @entity296 , where he was shooting season 19			0
when they arrived at @entity295 , he took @entity167 and @entity168 aside to let them know he was asking their mother to marry him and to ask for their help			0
the children quickly changed clothes and helped to lead her to @entity1 , who proposed			0
they married four months later			0
@entity314 , @entity315 while @entity1 spends a good amount of time traveling , he also very much appreciates what 's available in his own backyard of @entity247 , especially the beaches			0
" there 's such a fun vibe on the ( @entity314 ) boardwalk with some great people - watching , " he says			0
" all kinds of people show up : businessmen , surfers , moms , kids , all creating a crazy rhythm			0
the rings in @entity314 are a great little escape ... i just chalk up and swing away			0
around the world you 'd think @entity1 and his family would be tired of him traveling when he gets home from shooting halfway around the world			1
standing in front of the 10 - foot by 6 - foot map in their hallway , with pushpins marking where everyone has been , the family keeps talking about taking a month to go around the world			1
where would they stop ? for sure , @entity351 , @entity352 and @entity353			0
the rest of the trip is still up in the air			0
while he knows there 's plenty he has n't yet explored at home , " the other view is we have just one shot , and let 's say by plane , by train , by bus , by car , by scooter , by skateboard , we 're going to experience the world , " he says			1
" do we learn something we want to bring back home ? or did we find we are perfectly happy with the way things are ? " where do you think @entity1 and the cast and crew of " @entity5 " should go next season ? share your thoughts in the comments below .			1
