one hundred years ago monday , @entity0 launched the most successful third party presidential bid in @entity4 history , declaring , " we stand at @entity6 , and we battle for the @entity7 ! " it was the culmination of the @entity9 in @entity10 on august 6 , 1912			1
and its influence still echoes through our politics today			1
@entity0 , the former president , had tried and failed to wrest the @entity14 nomination from his successor , @entity15			1
his supporters believed that the nomination had been stolen by the conservative power brokers and declared their independence			0
and so the @entity9 was briefly born			1
known as " @entity0 " party , after @entity0 's declaration that he felt " as strong as a bull moose , " supporters saw it as defending the legacy of @entity25 against the big business establishment that had taken over the @entity14 after the @entity27			1
the @entity28 -- the populist party whose base was in corrupt , big - city bosses and the states of the former @entity34 -- were also an unappealing alternative			2
" the old parties are husks , with no real soul within either , divided on artificial lines , boss - ridden and privilege - controlled , " @entity0 declared , " each a jumble of incongruous elements , and neither daring to speak out wisely and fearlessly what should be said on the vital issues of the day			1
" @entity0 's @entity9 definitely did not shy away from taking fearless stands on the vital issues of the day			1
the party 's platform backed giving women the right to vote , the abolition of child labor , minimum wages , social security , public health standards , wildlife conservation , workman 's compensation , insurance against sickness and unemployment , lobbying reform , campaign finance reform and election reform			1
with socialist , communist and anarchist forces gaining momentum across the @entity67 , this was a platform dedicated to @entity0 's wise belief that " reform is the antidote to revolution			1
" the assembled crowd was not radical , described by the famed @entity74 newspaper editor @entity73 as " successful , middle class country town citizens , the farmer whose barn was painted , the well - paid railroad engineer and the country editor ... women doctors , women lawyers , women teachers			2
proletarian and @entity84 were absent			0
" in other words , this was a @entity87 , middle - class revolt against special interests on the far left and far right			0
among the @entity90 in the crowd were former @entity28 and @entity14 , including future @entity93 @entity92 , columnist @entity94 , " wise - use conservationist " @entity95 , @entity96 and settlement house pioneer @entity97 , who became the first woman to give a nominating speech at an @entity4 political convention			1
the energy of the occasion left an indelible impression on a generation			0
the best recent recounting of the convention comes in @entity110 ' " @entity109 , " the third volume of his essential work of @entity4 biography			2
in the moment , @entity73 described @entity0 " charging down the hotel corridors , stalking down an aisle of the @entity117 while the crowds roared , walking like a gladiator to the lions			2
" in contrast to the upcoming conventions in @entity124 , @entity125 , and @entity126 , @entity127 , the atmosphere was one of real , not canned , drama -- electric and unexpected			0
" can we imagine a convention today erupting in ' @entity134 ' just impromptu ? " asks @entity130 , the @entity131 's executive director			2
" we 've come to a place where putting out fresh ideas is dangerous in politics			0
candidates do n't want to give an agenda			0
@entity0 campaigned with an agenda			2
he told the convention , ' use me up and cast me aside			0
' take all of these ideas and run with them			0
... the goal was moving along the @entity9 's vision for what the new @entity4 in the 20th century should be			1
" roosevelt and the @entity9 were not successful in their effort to win the @entity151 in 1912			2
but they won 27 % of the popular vote -- an all - time high for third parties in presidential elections -- and @entity0 won 88 electoral votes to @entity15 's eight			1
the @entity28 cannily nominated their own progressive candidate , @entity157 , and he won the election in a landslide against the divided @entity14			2
but the ideas @entity0 and the @entity161 fought for did succeed in time			1
some , such as expanding the right to vote , enacting @entity163 and ending child labor , seem obvious to modern eyes			0
others , such as the fight for expanded health insurance , remain contentious civic debates			0
and concerns about the disproportionate influence of big business and other special interests on @entity4 elections and policy seem ripped from modern headlines			2
the political fault lines of the 1912 elections endure to this day as well			0
president @entity179 has explicitly tried to cast himself as the inheritor of @entity0 's progressive party fight in a @entity74 speech earlier this year			1
the @entity14 still contains competing establishment and reform factions , most recently seen in the factional split between @entity187 and @entity188 in 2000			0
and certainly there remain many independent - minded @entity4 who feel frustrated and politically homeless when faced with the two parties today			1
they are reformers in a world of radicals and reactionaries			0
politics is history in the present tense , and the study of history can inspire us to aim high in our own lives			1
in honor of the 100th anniversary of the 1912 election , the @entity0 birthplace in @entity201 has mounted an exhibit focused on his @entity207 campaign			1
enclosed are speeches , campaign cartoons and political posters			0
( full disclosure , i 'm on the advisory board of the @entity131 )			0
perhaps most striking is the sight of @entity0 's still - faintly bloodstained shirt , where bullet holes mark the october 1912 assassination attempt , alongside the gun the would - be killer fired			1
the bullet 's velocity was stopped by an eyeglass case and a thick manuscript , for a speech which @entity0 characteristically insisted on giving before going to the hospital			1
" i have altogether too important things to think of to feel any concern over my own death , " @entity0 declared			2
" i am ahead of the game anyway			0
no man has had a happier life than i have led			0
" one hundred years later , @entity0 's vigorous citizenship and heroic sense of politics still inspire			1
if we understand the lessons of his life correctly , it can still instruct			0
