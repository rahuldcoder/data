@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity7 hopeful @entity6 and his accuser had consensual sex the night she told police he had sexually assaulted her , the attorney for the @entity5 star quarterback said thursday			1
@entity11 said his client 's dna was found on the clothing of the woman , who nearly a year ago said she was raped			1
@entity16 , which first reported the dna development , said the @entity0 crime lab determined that the possibility it was someone else 's dna would be one in 2.2 trillion			1
@entity11 and state attorney @entity21 confirmed two dna samples have been taken in the case , one from @entity6 and the other from a witness			1
" i will tell you from day 1 , december of 2012 , our defense ( has ) not changed whatsoever , " @entity11 told @entity26			0
" these dna results had no effect on it			2
it had no effect on the testimony on the eyewitnesses that were there			0
" the case grew more curious thursday when the recently retired police chief of the @entity41 told @entity2 he was unaware there was a rape investigation against @entity6 , who has led the @entity44 to a no. 2 national ranking , until he learned about it in the media			1
@entity48 , who left the post in october , said when he was the city 's top cop that he always knew about cases involving athletes , even if the players were n't charged			1
" i 'd like to know why it did n't make it to me , " he said			2
" it could be because the victim did n't want to prosecute			2
but that 's a question i have			2
" the case began in december when the woman , a student at @entity5 in @entity1 , reported she had been sexually assaulted			1
a month later she accused @entity6 of the alleged rape			1
@entity41 interim chief @entity62 told reporters wednesday night that the accuser " broke off contact " with them in february and did n't want to go forward with the case			1
the news conference followed a statement from the family of the accuser criticizing the department 's investigation			1
the lengthy message , which was printed by the @entity74 newspaper and other media , blasted the lead detective on the case			2
the accuser 's family said detective @entity79 warned her attorney that @entity1 is a " big football town " and her life could be miserable if she pursued the case			1
@entity79 has not responded to several @entity2 requests for comment			0
@entity11 , @entity6 's attorney , said he believed the case was closed months ago			1
but @entity62 said the case is still open			2
" we hope to move it forward as quickly as we can in coordination with the state attorney 's office and bring closure to it , " he said			1
no one has been charged in the investigation , and @entity21 said his office has yet to interview the accuser			0
he will meet with his staff friday , he said , to determine their next steps			0
@entity48 called @entity79 a good investigator and said he finds it hard to believe the detective would pressure an accuser			0
the story became public when some media outlets put in public records requests for the alleged victim 's complaint			1
@entity1 police have released a heavily redacted incident report documenting a sexual assault allegation in early december 2012			0
the family 's statement said they never leaked information about the case , a response to @entity11 's comment last week that the timing of the media discovering the case -- in the middle of the college football season -- was " very suspect			1
" @entity48 also questioned the timing			0
the woman 's attorney strongly disputed that thursday			1
" we did not want this to blow up in the press , " @entity128 told @entity2			0
" everybody is asserting about the timing and implying the victim ( tipped off the media ) , that 's not the case			2
she was in classes at @entity139			0
she had to leave school and come back home because of this			0
" she found it " inherently contradictory " that @entity48 said @entity79 was a good detective , but @entity48 said he was left unaware of the case			2
@entity48 said his former department never gave athletes preferential treatment			0
police are aware of the perception , he said			0
" so anytime we got a case involving an athlete we would go above and beyond in our investigation			0
it 's almost to the contrary of what people perceive , " he told @entity2			0
