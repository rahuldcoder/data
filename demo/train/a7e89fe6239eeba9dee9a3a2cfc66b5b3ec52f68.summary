-- fresh bilateral talks have started in @entity2 this week between the @entity3 and @entity4 over @entity6 's nuclear ambitions -- but it is unlikely that the @entity9 group will lift major financial sanctions before the july deadline for this round of negotiations			1
instead , the most likely scenario appears to be an extending of the current interim agreement			0
although the @entity16 recently verified that @entity4 has eliminated its second stage uranium enrichment capacity , which was something of a significant concession , @entity6 is unlikely to gain a permanent lifting of oil and banking sanctions by way of return			1
nevertheless , there is still a clear trend towards a break between commercial and nuclear diplomacy			1
even if the latter stalls , the former is a train that has left the station -- and that will constitute the decisive and irrevocable breakthrough in the end			0
as the nuclear talks continues the cat - and - mouse pattern begun more than a decade ago , commercial engagement is heading into uncharted -- and likely irreversible -- territory			1
the ink is not yet dry on november 's @entity40 , which was intended to ease sanctions : @entity42 has promised to buy 500,000 barrels per day of @entity4 crude oil , lifting its exports by 50 % and adding $ 1.5 billion a month to @entity4 's struggling economy			1
a $ 20 billion barter deal is in the works , exchanging @entity4 oil for @entity42 industrial goods and food			1
with @entity53 revealing a deep fissure between the @entity55 and @entity56 , it is unlikely that @entity42 would comply with any extension of sanctions anyway			0
@entity4 's foreign minister @entity59 has firmly declared that there will be no agreement until all sanctions are lifted			1
the rest of the world is taking him at his word as well			1
at the @entity68 's annual meeting in @entity69 this january , @entity4 president @entity66 met with @entity70 and with @entity72 president @entity71 , followed by a large @entity74 business delegation -- including major firms such as @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 -- visiting @entity6 in february			1
@entity79 has resumed car part shipments to @entity4			1
clearly , the business community moves faster than governments			0
@entity83 already does more than $ 20 billion per year in trade with @entity4 , and is responsible for most of the $ 16 billion direct foreign investment into @entity4 during 2013 double the volume in the previous year			1
in february @entity83 's commerce minister @entity87 signed an agreement in @entity6 aimed at doubling non-oil trade in the coming years			0
@entity83 - @entity4 trade and investment volumes have fluctuated due to sanctions -- and with the @entity3 withdrawal from @entity95 all but complete , both countries are accelerating plans to deepen the " new @entity102 " rail and highway corridor across the only country that separates them			1
no doubt the next @entity95 president , who faces empty coffers as @entity3 aid slows to a trickle , will welcome his neighbors ' initiative			0
there have been plenty of other willing sanctions busters			0
@entity112 has sold close to $ 10 billion in gold to @entity4 in exchange for much needed gas			2
@entity116 and other @entity118 republics have conducted oil swap deals with @entity4 in which they ship crude across the @entity122 to @entity4 terminals and @entity4 delivers oil to their clients via its @entity128 terminals			2
the message is clear : sanctions are a false piety , and while they have been disastrous for an economy which might be on a par by now with @entity112 or @entity135 , they do n't seem to have damaged @entity4 's nuclear program any more than fresh sanctions on @entity42 over the @entity53 crisis will hurt its military			1
the @entity16 has said that @entity4 's centrifuge count , necessary to enrich uranium , has risen from 300 to 19,000 , with a potential timeline to test a nuclear weapon of anywhere from one to three months			1
some experts argue that even a military strike on one of @entity4 's major nuclear facilities at @entity149 or @entity150 would only delay nuclear weapon breakout capacity by six to 12 months			1
as far as global companies are concerned , therefore , blocking them from making commercial inroads into @entity4 makes little , if any , logical sense			1
while @entity3 prides itself on doing the " heavy lifting " of conflict and diplomacy to liberate @entity162 and contain @entity4 's nuclear program , the rest of the world seems to simply want @entity163 to get out of the way			1
today 's dynamic is reminiscent of when @entity165 opened up to the rest of the world in 2003 : once @entity168 had pledged to abandon its nuclear program , @entity167 raced into the country to make deals , with then @entity173 prime minister @entity172 lobbying for years on behalf of then - leader @entity174 and @entity176 business interests			1
observing how @entity162 's oil sector has played out is also instructive			0
@entity3 sacrificed more than 4,000 lives on @entity162 soil in order for @entity181 , @entity42 's @entity182 , @entity184 's @entity183 , and @entity185 to dominate the country 's production and exports			0
the @entity4 dynamic is similarly shifting from isolation to tug - of - war : whoever builds the most " @entity102 " connecting commercially to @entity4 wins			2
a simple look at a map will suffice : @entity4 is a large and centrally located nation with thousands of years of regional ties -- and a large diaspora -- which serve to keep the country connected			2
it is not @entity198 ( not that isolating @entity198 has led to regime change either ) : decades have been wasted pretending that a central civilization such as @entity4 could be contained , or believing that it is deeply irrational , a cause rather than a country			2
bringing @entity4 fully into the global economy is an opportunity few are willing to resist any longer : even @entity3 companies			2
@entity207 , @entity208 and other @entity3 food producers and traders have been among the chief beneficiaries of loopholes and exemptions in existing sanctions			0
now others want in on @entity4 's lucrative market , not least oil and industrial giants eager to access and overhaul @entity4 's decrepit energy infrastructure			2
under the vague provisions of the @entity2 agreement , @entity220 and @entity221 now claim they have the right to inspect and repair @entity3 - made aircraft engines used in @entity4 's civilian aircraft			2
if one year from now @entity4 remains close to developing a nuclear weapon , then we can expect that @entity42 , @entity83 , @entity229 , @entity112 and other nations will nonetheless have moved well ahead in exploiting the current thaw to lock - in long - term deals with @entity6			1
furthermore , the @entity167 temptation to tap @entity4 's energy supply and access its flows through the @entity236 and other gas pipelines will prove overwhelming , especially in the aftermath of @entity42 's ever unpredictable aggression in eastern @entity167			2
the @entity3 stands little chance of unwinding these commercial arrangements , even if @entity4 proves recalcitrant on the nuclear front			1
instead , @entity176 countries should understand that their leverage can be more effective if applied to a dynamic of engagement than one of containment			0
the @entity3 should add its weight to this tug - of - war over @entity4			2
if the @entity55 fully lifts sanctions for the first time in decades , it can strongly re-shape @entity4 's economic and diplomatic constellations			2
the @entity3 should , as it has done in @entity254 , allow @entity3 companies to invest directly except with blacklisted individuals and entities , and with certain additional reporting compliance requirements			0
after decades of leading isolation and sanctions , president @entity259 had an impactful visit to @entity263 in 2012 and @entity3 companies now enjoy a privileged status in @entity254			0
@entity4 's recent cancellation of a $ 2.5 billion @entity268 project for the joint development of the @entity271 oil field project is a very strong sign that an open @entity4 will choose @entity176 quality goods and services over @entity83 's often under - whelming technology			0
places like @entity277 , whose long - standing @entity4 trade has been curbed substantially due to sanctions , would likely have a greater role in the race for the economic and strategic spoils in @entity4			0
indeed , the @entity285 has just concluded a high - level agricultural and industrial delegation to @entity4 that explored both investments in @entity4 and facilitating @entity4 exports			0
in a more regulated framework , @entity277 will become the offshore hub for @entity4 's rehabilitation for at least a decade or more , a safe city to negotiate with @entity4 counterparties , a location where investors can place collateral for transactions rather than with @entity4 banks directly			0
this would also make it easier to monitor a large portion of the investment into @entity4			0
@entity303 , which in recent years has been a back - channel mediator between the @entity3 and @entity4 , has just unveiled plans for a 1,000 km gas pipeline to @entity4 , making it another crucial @entity308 ally in overseeing the evolution of @entity4 's energy sector			0
lifting sanctions would not suddenly make @entity4 or @entity4 pro-western rather than playing the country 's central geography to multi-align in all directions with @entity83 , @entity42 , @entity229 , @entity167 and others			0
but it would empower a stronger commercial constituency inside @entity4 to keep access to its markets open -- and more openly oppose @entity6 policies that risk undermining their gains			1
this hardly amounts to an anti-nuclear lobby , but would certainly constitute one with a lot more to lose by supporting the regime 's agenda			0
@entity4 will only accept such a path as a genuine two - way street			0
as such , it must hold up its end of the bargain -- or face fully justified @entity176 measures -- from sabotage to cyber-attacks to airstrikes -- to delay its nuclear program			0
but @entity3 should not delude itself : even a nuclear @entity4 is one most of the world will do business with .			1
