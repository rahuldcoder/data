the security camera footage broadcast by @entity1 shows a grisly scene : a black man in @entity4 , @entity5 , being fatally run over by a pickup truck after he was viciously beaten in a motel parking lot on a sunday morning in june			1
prosecutors say a group of white teens chose the man at random			1
they say the alleged ringleader , an 18 - year - old now charged with murder , laughed about it afterward and boasted in a phone conversation about how he " ran that n --- -- over			0
" when we 're confronted with such a shocking act of violence , we search for answers			0
we want to know what 's in the hearts and minds of the attackers			1
we wonder what motivates someone to extinguish a life for no other reason than the color of the person 's skin			1
and , in an odd way , some people take comfort in the fact that it happened in @entity5 , with its legacy of @entity38 segregation and terrorism aimed at the @entity42 - @entity41 community			1
we want to see the crime as simply a reflection of a @entity46 state still haunted by its racist past -- something that could n't happen in other parts of this country			2
in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , a 37 - year - old @entity56 immigrant , was stabbed to death in 2008 when he was attacked by a gang of white teens who decided to hunt down and attack @entity59 for sport -- or as they called it , " beaner hopping			1
" in @entity66 , @entity67 , three men and a woman with white supremacist tattoos went into a predominantly @entity69 neighborhood on july 3 , 2009 , looking for a " nonwhite " to hurt			0
they attacked a @entity69 man in an alley			2
yelling racial slurs , they reportedly stabbed him three times			0
in @entity78 , @entity79 , the opening night of the state fair this month turned to mayhem when dozens of black youths began attacking white people			2
a 16 - year - old boy detained by police said he and others attacked white people because they were " easy targets , " according to the @entity86			0
we ca n't pretend that what happened in @entity5 that june morning could n't happen elsewhere			1
it already has , and it will again			0
the social fabric in our country is fragile , and the fault lines are often defined by race			1
our communities and schools are increasingly segregated			0
@entity97 and our economic woes are leaving many young people without hope for the future			1
and we 're seeing a backlash against the nation 's changing ethnic makeup			2
all of this provides fertile ground for bigotry and violence to take root and flourish			0
meanwhile , our political system seems paralyzed , incapable of protecting the interests of working people , much less pulling us together			0
messages of hate and bigotry can be found not only on the fringes of our society but virtually nonstop on television , talk radio and the @entity119 , where certain groups of people are demonized and held up as scapegoats for our problems			0
too many of our politicians pour fuel on the fire by exploiting divisions in our society -- fostering an us - versus - them mentality and casting entire groups of people as " the other			0
" despite the promise of the @entity136 presidency , it 's time to realize we 're not living in a " post-racial " society			2
it 's time to speak out against bigotry and to call out those in public life who encourage hate and violence with their words			2
and it 's time to invest in the future of our nation and its youth -- to provide hope and opportunity to the next generation			1
our future depends on it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 @entity158 .			1

he says @entity41 's social fabric is fragile , and fault lines are defined by race and ethnicity
