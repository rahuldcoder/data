-- life had not quite worked out the way @entity3 had planned			1
a few years ago the whole world was laid out at the 21 - year - old @entity7 striker 's feet			1
@entity8 , as he is known by his coaches and teammates , was considered one of the most naturally talented players ever to emerge in @entity7 soccer			1
he was quickly brought into the national team set up , playing in every game at the @entity18 - 17 @entity17 finals			2
at the age of 16 he was the second youngest player ever to be drafted into the @entity20			2
perhaps prophetically , the youngest was @entity21 , a name that has become a euphemism for talent unfulfilled			2
luck , nerve , injury , temperament : no one could explain @entity31 's decline after being called up to the @entity7 under - 20 squad			1
but decline he did as he went from @entity33 to @entity34 and then to his hometown club , the @entity35 in the @entity36 -- the second tier of @entity7 soccer			1
the decline appeared terminal when he was released at the end of last season			2
. and then out of the blue an email arrived from the country of his birth -- @entity47			1
" it said that @entity47 would like to invite me to play for the national team , " @entity8 told @entity0 , speaking from his hotel room in the capital @entity50			1
@entity52 calling @entity8 had left @entity47 with his parents when he was eight			1
he only remembers blurry snippets from his life there , while he does not speak much of the language , just a few words and phrases			2
he still does not know quite what to make of how things have turned out			2
his entire life had been geared towards one day playing for the full @entity7 men 's national team			1
now there was another potential future on the @entity67			2
" i did n't think they wanted me to go right away but then they kept emailing me , " added @entity8			2
" eventually i replied back , thinking it might be something for the future			2
a couple of times we had contact over the phone			2
then i realized they were serious			2
" soon @entity8 was flying to the high altitude of @entity50 and into @entity47 's squad for the @entity81 , a biennial tournament considered one of the toughest , and most entertaining in world soccer			1
the story of @entity85 's @entity84 @entity47 had once been champions of @entity52			1
but a devastating series of famines and wars killed millions of people in the 1970s and 80s			2
soccer took a back seat until last year when the @entity93 came from nowhere to qualify for their first @entity94 in 31 years			1
coach @entity95 has masterminded their shock qualification -- @entity47 having somehow made it through after losing 5 - 3 against @entity98 in their first match			1
but @entity95 knew that , in a continent that provides some of the best players to the best clubs in the world -- with top @entity106 players playing for the likes of @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 -- experience in foreign leagues would be needed			2
eventually that trawl led to the @entity20 and to @entity31 , who was handed his first start in a warm - up match against @entity117			1
" it was a special moment to score , " @entity8 said of his first - half strike in a 2 - 1 victory			2
" it will live with me for the rest of my life			2
" a @entity35 winter after emigrating to the @entity7 the @entity3 family settled in the wintry climes of @entity127			1
his father made a living at a driving school , while @entity8 soon discovered that he had a talent at soccer			2
" it was the @entity7 , the land of opportunity , so it was a chance to be raised in a better environment to have that opportunity in life , " he said of the family 's reasons for emigrating			1
" but for any kid growing up in @entity52 , soccer is the first sport they play			1
i was never really serious but i started playing club teams , i was doing good and realized i should stick with it ... everything for me then was all about playing for the @entity7			1
" he tried his hand briefly at @entity149 -- as a kicker his record for a field goal was 34 yards -- but soccer was always his first love			0
it was after @entity3 had been called up to the @entity20 residency program at the @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159 that @entity31 started to dream of the world stage			1
" i always wanted to play for the @entity7 national team , " he said			1
" i got an @entity163 - 15 invite to stay in @entity159 and from day one it was special , playing pre-season against @entity20 teams			2
i realized i could make it			0
we were already playing professional teams			0
i thought , i could be there one day			0
i would n't be where i was today if was n't for @entity7 soccer			1
" @entity8 graduated seamlessly through @entity7 soccer 's national youth teams , playing at the @entity18 - 17 @entity17 in @entity174 before being called up to the under - 20 team , the last step before becoming a full international			1
" @entity8 was one of the most talented players to come through the @entity7 @entity179 and 20 teams , " said @entity180 , the current youth academy director at @entity34 , who was coach of the @entity18 -20 @entity7 national team at the time			1
" but [ he ] was not able to make the step to the highest level			0
[ @entity31 ] signed as one of the youngest players in the history of @entity20 , only @entity21 was younger			0
technically very sound ... but [ he ] was not able to adapt to the professional game at the highest level			0
" the next big thing ? what went wrong ? " i 'll be honest , i did n't have any injury when i was at @entity34 and i 'm not someone to blame other people for things in the past , " explained @entity8			0
" i was doing good but as time goes , growing up with so many coaches -- @entity34 has had eight coaches in five years -- it effected my playing time			2
" when a new coach came in i 'd get a rhythm , they 'd get fired and then a new one came in			0
all of a sudden you have to rebuild trust			0
it kind of kept happening			0
" after @entity31 tried to get his big break in @entity208 , but that did not work out either			0
" i was here and there in @entity212 and @entity213			0
i did n't find a place where i really fitted in			0
it did n't go the way i wanted			0
you have to live with it and learn			0
" then came the call from @entity47			1
" the weather was very difficult especially coming from the cold and suddenly i 'm in high altitude , " he said of his arrival in @entity224 , whichat 2,355 meters above sea level is the fifth highest capital city in the world			0
" it was tough in the first week			0
but i 've got used to it			0
it was time to play for my country , the country i was born in			0
" young americans @entity8 is not the only @entity7 soccer player that has made the move to a different national team			1
during qualification for the @entity244 , national teams from @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 , among others , have scoured @entity7 soccer 's talent network looking for second and third generation immigrants to bolster their teams			1
an american soccer star playing for @entity240 " there are a growing number of @entity7 playing for other national teams but it 's almost a second choice , " said @entity250 , a @entity251 blogger , who runs @entity252 abroad , a website detailing the foreign adventures of @entity7 soccer players			1
he has seen a huge number of players coming through the @entity7 system before turning up in the most unlikely of places from @entity47 to @entity263			1
as many as 400 play in @entity208 alone			0
" there 's so many different ethnically diverse people in the @entity7			1
soccer is new but we 've always been athletic people			0
we have state - of - the - art fitness and dieting			2
it 's quite attractive to foreign coaches , " he said			0
" if soccer can make it work in this country it could have revolutionary effect on global football			0
" now @entity8 has the chance to put his career back on track			0
currently a free agent , a good @entity94 could secure him a contract back in the @entity7 or even in @entity208			1
first there is the task of negotiating a tough group containing reigning champions @entity287 , former champions @entity288 and @entity290			0
" technically they are very , very talented , " @entity8 said of his teammates			0
although he can not speak @entity293 , he communicates with @entity294 in @entity295			0
" they have a different style of playing			0
no one thought @entity287 would win the @entity94 last year but they shocked everybody			1
" shop window true life did not quite work out as expected for @entity3			1
but sometimes that is not necessarily a bad thing			0
@entity307 coach @entity306 recently argued that the @entity94 is the last tournament in world football where unknown players and teams can emerge to be stars			1
" this time in @entity52 you will have @entity47 , " he said			1
" if i ask you to name five @entity47 players , i am sure you will have a problem			1
" @entity306 's quotes have been used by @entity95 to motivate his team further			0
but the chance to play against some of the best players in the world , and get his career back on track , is motivation enough for @entity31			0
" it 's a great opportunity for me , " he said			0
" soccer can change the the way rest of the world view @entity47 and @entity47 soccer			1
after the goal i scored people recognize me in the street			0
i hope i do that on the big stage			0
" " only @entity335 knows			0
i 'll leave it up to @entity335			0
