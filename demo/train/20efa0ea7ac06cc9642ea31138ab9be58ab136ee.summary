-- in a @entity4 slum , more than one in four children under 5 will die , but in a wealthier part of the @entity8 capital , the mortality rate is one in almost 67 , according to a @entity10 report released tuesday			0
a woman lies next to her sick child at a medical center in @entity14 , @entity15 , in july			0
the @entity16 2008 aims to spotlight disparities in health care across the globe , and as the @entity4 example illustrates , the differences exist not only between the @entity22 -- they can occur just across town			2
@entity10 roundly criticizes the organization , finance and delivery of health care and calls advances in the field " deeply and unacceptably unequal , with many disadvantaged populations increasingly lagging behind or even losing ground			1
" the report says that a citizen of a wealthy nation can live up to 40 years longer than someone in a poor country , and of the 136 million women who will give birth this year , about 58 million ( 43 percent ) will receive no medical assistance during childbirth or the postpartum period			1
@entity42 executive director @entity41 said the sharp inequities in the cost and access to health care often speak to larger societal ills			2
" high maternal , infant and under - five mortality often indicates lack of access to basic services such as clean water and sanitation , immunizations and proper nutrition , " she said in a statement			0
who director - general @entity58 insists the dilemma is not just a matter of haves versus have - nots			0
" a world that is greatly out of balance in matters of health is neither stable nor secure , " she said in a statement from @entity64 , @entity65 , where the report was released			2
the difference in annual government expenditures on health care is more canyon than gap , according to the report			1
while the wealthiest nations dole out as much as $ 6,000 per person each year , some countries are unable or unwilling to spend more than $ 20 per person			0
however , while calling for wide - ranging reforms in the delivery of primary health care , the report notes that it is n't always a matter of government expenditures			1
@entity86 and @entity87 both spend less than $ 100 per person on health care			1
but while the health - adjusted life expectancy in @entity87 is under 30 years of age , @entity86 's is almost 70 -- a figure comparable to the @entity94 , which spends more than $ 2,500 a person on health care			1
" when countries at the same level of economic development are compared , those where health care is organized around the tenets of primary health care produce a higher level of health for the same investment , " the report says			2
who defines primary health care as being " universally accessible to individuals and families in the community by means acceptable to them , through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford			0
" the organization 's report -- titled " @entity118 -- now @entity125 " -- calls for a move toward universal coverage to reverse a trend over the last 30 years in which disparities in the levels of health care have actually widened			1
@entity127 coverage , the report says , would lower the risks of disease outbreaks for everyone , not just the impoverished			0
currently , the most common means of paying for health care is out of pocket , which @entity10 says is the " most inequitable method for financing health care services			1
" the report says more than 100 million people fall into poverty in a given year because of health care bills			1
another problem , the report says , is that doctors tend not to focus on prevention			0
" rather than improving their response capacity and anticipating new challenges , health systems seem to be drifting from one short - term priority to another , increasingly fragmented and without a clear sense of direction , " according to the report			0
but the report also handed out accolades , most notably to @entity153 and @entity154			2
who applauded the @entity157 's 17,000 " health houses , " which serve about 1,500 people each			0
the report credited the centers with boosting @entity153 ' life expectancy from 63 to 71 years between 1990 and 2006			1
and in @entity154 , the nation 's " polyclinics " have yielded one of the longest life expectancies ( 78 years ) of any developing country , the report says			0
the report called for all sectors of society to help determine how health care is allocated , and it singled out the @entity94 for spending just 0.1 percent of its health budget on health systems research -- the kind of research that policymakers use to decide how money is spent			1
the report also points to the pharmaceutical industry 's impact on health care in the @entity94 , where the average expenditure on prescription drugs in 2005 was $ 1,141 per person -- twice the average in @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 , and 10 times the average in @entity190			2
to combat the problems facing global health care , @entity10 says in its report that nations must improve coverage and delivery , as well as policy and leadership			1
it acknowledges that primary health care is n't cheap , but asserts that the " investment provides better value for money than its alternatives			0
" " the legitimacy of health authorities increasingly depends on how well they assume responsibility to develop and reform the health sector according to what people value -- in terms of health and of what is expected of health systems in society , " the report says .			0

health care disparities make world " neither stable nor secure , " @entity10 director says
report : 43 percent of women giving birth this year will do so without medical help
@entity86 , @entity87 have 40 - year gap in life expectancy despite expenditures
report applauds @entity153 , @entity154 for finding ways to improve health care
