-- just days after signing a bumper multi-year deal with @entity4 , @entity1 made an embarrassing early exit in @entity6 along with stablemate @entity7			1
the world 's top two golfers were supposed to usher in a new era of dominance within the sport for @entity4 , but neither man made the cut on a disappointing day			1
the world @entity15 finished on six - over , while @entity7 missed out after being hit with a two - stroke penalty for rules of infringement			1
@entity20 finished top of the leaderboard on eight - under following a round of 69 , but it was @entity1 and @entity7 who caught the headlines			1
@entity4 unveils @entity1 : @entity7 's heir apparent @entity1 , playing with his new @entity4 clubs for the first time , had not missed a cut since the @entity31 in @entity32 last june			1
but after starting the day well down the field following an opening round of 75 , the @entity33 failed to battle back , despite reverting to his old putter			0
" i just felt like the greens that i 've been practising on are a lot faster than these , " he told reporters			0
" the @entity4 putter is great on that , but getting to here it 's just a weight issue more than anything else			2
" i can feel the head of the one i used today a little bit better , but the change was to no avail			0
" i 've got a few weeks off now to work at it and try and get my game in decent shape for the @entity54			0
" @entity1 had vowed to improve on his opening round and hit three straight pars , but three bogeys in the next four holes left him floundering on six - over			1
birdies at eight and nine allowed some respite , but bogeys on the 10th and 14th ended his chances of making the cut at the course where he finished second last year			2
@entity1 teams up with @entity7 at @entity4 he said : " i knew it was going to be a tough week with everything going on , but i was just looking forward to getting to the golf course and getting back to what i do and what i 'm comfortable with			1
" it just did n't work out like that			0
i hit the ball really well last week in practice in @entity75 and just sort of gradually got worse this week for some reason			2
woods eyes long rivalry with @entity1 " but i 'm going to spend the weekend here and practise and work at it with @entity82 ( coach @entity81 ) a little bit			2
" it 's very disappointing			2
you really want to get off to a nice start at the start of the season , but i 've got to realise that it is only the start of the season			0
" as long as i feel like my game is in good shape heading into @entity93 ( the @entity94 on april 11 - 14 ) that 's all i 'm worried about			2
" what kind of @entity4 poster boy will @entity1 be ? woods fared little better after he was hit with a two - stroke penalty for rules of infringement in the sand at the fifth hole			1
and after finishing one one - over for the day , @entity7 said he just fell short following a poor start			1
" it 's tough because i did n't get off to a very good start today and i fought and got it back , " he told reporters			0
" i was right there and i felt that if i had close to even par , i had a chance going into the weekend , being only eight back			0
evidently it was n't enough			0
" meanwhile , world number five @entity112 , will take a one - shot lead into the third round after moving clear of @entity116 @entity115 , @entity118 's @entity117 and @entity120 's @entity119			1
" i felt like my game definitely sharpened up , " @entity112 said			0
" when you have perfect distance control you know you are swinging it well			0
