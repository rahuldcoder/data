oops , she did it again			0
some fans of @entity3 are accusing the singer of lip - syncing to her song " perfume " during her @entity9 show			2
according to gossip site @entity12 they did n't , @entity11 ' mouth is moving but the audience is mostly hearing singer @entity16 's version of the track			1
@entity18 points out that @entity16 -- best known for her hit song " chandelier " -- is credited as one of the writers of " perfume			1
" an acoustic version of the song as performed by @entity16 is big on @entity26			1
" if you listen closely to the performance video , you can make out some of @entity11 ' vocals under @entity16 's more charactered voice , " @entity27 writes for @entity18			1
" that 's because , most likely , @entity11 uses @entity16 's track as an in - monitor guide when she sings			1
only this time it was put into the house mix , making for an embarrassing accident			0
" it 's not the first time @entity11 has been called out for the vocalizations during her @entity9 show , which is part of a two - year residency			2
in reviewing the show for the @entity46 , writer @entity44 points out that the singer 's show appears to take its title , " @entity49 , " literally			2
" whatever the scale of the number ... the singer 's presence felt so diminished -- her dancing a tentative shadow of what it used to be , her vocals apparently lip - synced for the majority of the show -- as if to make the production 's title seem a taunt , " @entity44 writes			0
while her manager @entity63 initially denied that @entity11 was n't singing live during the show , he later backtracked during an interview with @entity66			1
" to put on the show that she puts on , it 's virtually impossible to sing the entire time and do what she does , " he said			0
" she 's singing on every song , basically , when she has the ability to sing			0
there 's no way you can dance for 90 minutes straight and sing the entire time			0
