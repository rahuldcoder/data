@entity0 -- @entity2 ruled at the @entity3 over the weekend			1
it was a reminder of how central the theme of travel has long been to tattoos			1
how so ? consider the vintage designs that proved so popular among the thousands of inky fans gathered from all over the world at the three - day meet			1
it 's the classic iconography of the sailor 's bicep -- signifiers , in other words , of the professional , inveterate traveler			0
traditional swing " there 's definitely a swing back to traditional			0
the fashion is the old @entity32 marine styles , " @entity27 , co-organiser of the convention , told the @entity29			2
but another trend on show had an equally strong travel imprint			2
along with " [ t ] he old - school sailor stuff ... the @entity43 are really in vogue now , " @entity36 , a second - generation tattooist at the show told the paper , referring to designs thick with swords and samurais			0
such oriental themes hark back to the allure of the exotic , when wearing a tattoo so often symbolized that you 'd been somewhere foreign -- possibly very foreign -- and were therefore also probably a little suspicious			1
now all a tat need signify is that you know how to find your way to a trendy inner - city tattoo parlor			0
could it be that a return to rootless maritime themes and the mysterious east are an attempt to restore a demimonde thrill to a practice that 's becoming so mainstream that the next radical statement could be to go entirely tattoo - free ? or to tattoo your head -- another unmissable trend at the convention that one artist present called a potential " life - ruiner , " and something she , like many of her fellow practitioners , never offered			1
scrubbed clean seen as one of the great follies of youth , tattooing -- especially when it 's on someone 's head -- can make you want to scream , " you ca n't scrub it off ! " except that you can			0
painful and expensive it might be , but lasering can now return a tattooed body to a blank , if slightly smudgy , canvas			0
leaving you to travel the world in search of new tattoos			1
judging by the skilled artists present , by invitation only , at the convention , electrifying designs are on offer in a growing number of countries around the world			2
and to think you just used to sew little flags on to your backpack to show all the places you 'd traveled to .			0
