-- pop star @entity1 filed suit on wednesday against @entity3 , claiming he was not paid for his image on merchandise from the hit television show , " @entity7 , " in which he starred			1
" for nearly 40 years , defendants have swindled mr. @entity1 out of his rightful share of the profits from @entity7 , and when mr. @entity1 has inquired as to the matter , have lied to him so as to continue to conceal their deception , " said the lawsuit , filed on wednesday in @entity9			1
" mr. @entity1 has reason to believe , and does reasonably believe , that defendants have been perpetrating a scam " and " will continue to go to any and all lengths necessary , no matter how despicable , to avoid upholding " his contract , the suit said			2
named as defendants are @entity22 , and subsidiaries @entity24 and @entity25 the suit , which alleges fraud and breach of contract , demands " in excess of millions of dollars , in amount to be determined at trial			0
" a @entity3 spokeswoman said the company does not comment on matters involving litigation			1
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity1 , 61 , said he simply wants what 's owed to him			1
" it 's just a matter of being fair , and doing the right thing , " @entity1 said			2
" i have no other alternative if @entity3 is not going to be reasonable			2
" he told @entity0 that his former manager told him he has only been paid about $ 5,000 for merchandise			1
" i 'm going to let a jury decide if @entity1 is entitled to his fair share , " he told @entity0			2
under his 1971 contract with @entity24 , @entity1 was supposed to get 15 percent of net merchandising revenues for the use of his image , voice or likeness , and no more than half of that for items in which that if other cast members appeared			1
" mr. @entity1 quickly became a teen idol , " the suit , filed by attorneys @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , states			1
" at the height of the show 's success , he received an average of 30,000 letters from fans a week ; having the largest fan club in the world in its day , surpassing even @entity71 and @entity72			0
" the suit said the show , which aired from 1970 to 1974 , was one of the first -- if not the first -- to be merchandized on a worldwide scale with board games , magazines , coloring books , paperbacks , posters , pillow cases , toy guitars , dollars , lunch boxes , beach towels , pencil cases , comic books , children 's ' clothing , and music sales			0
" all of which , it has been reported by knowledgeable news sources , generated nearly $ 500 million for defendants , " the suit said			0
despite promises in his 1971 contract to provide financial statements for merchandising , @entity3 has " either never provided such accountings and reports , or provided such accountings and reports only begrudgingly , inconsistently , inaccurately and fraudulently			1
" in a letter sent to @entity3 in may , @entity1 's attorney @entity103 , requested a full accounting of the merchandise			1
" we are formally requesting an accounting and payment for any and all sale , exploitation , or other use of @entity1 's name , likeness , voice or other exercise of such merchandising rights , " states the letter to @entity108 , executive vice president of legal affairs for @entity109			1
" in that regard , we also request a prompt and full accounting and payment of proceeds for any merchandise that was sold , exploited or otherwise used subsequent to the rights period set forth in the agreement			0
" @entity108 responded in a letter that @entity3 " could not ( and so far as we know did not ) enter into any new merchandising licenses " using @entity1 's " name , voice and likeness rights " after the show went off the air			1
" we have searched for copies of the merchandising net proceeds rendered to mr. @entity1 in the 1970s , but have been unable to locate them , " the letter said			1
" however , we did find some correspondence ... showing that mr. @entity1 's representatives audited such statements			0
therefore , they must have been rendered to him			0
" any potential claims , the letter said , are invalid because the " statutes of limitation " had expired decades ago			0
asked why he waited so long to raise the merchandising issue , @entity1 said he did n't have a copy of his contract until , after a string of moves and business managers , he found it in a box that he had n't opened since the 1970s			1
besides his claims that he was cheated out of merchandising revenues , he said new merchandise from the show has continued to be produced in the last 10 years			2
he said , since the merchandising rights reverted to him one year after the show went off the air and he was entitled to profits from the show , he was supposed to also get paid for any new merchandise			2
for example , @entity1 showed @entity0 a " @entity7 " toy bus and model kit with a 2001 copyright			1
the company that manufactured the toy , @entity170 , has since been sold			0
but a spokeswoman for the new company confirmed that the toy was produced in 1998 and again in 2001 with @entity3 's permission			2
a toy hamster that sings " @entity175 " also has a 2001 copyright from @entity177 , a company vice president , told @entity0 that @entity179 got permission to use music from a @entity3 subsidiary			0
still another " @entity7 " toy bus has a 2003 copyright from @entity25 , which is @entity185 , a @entity3 subsidiary			1
a @entity3 spokeswoman had no comment when @entity0 asked about these recent copyrights			1
the only other cast member reached by @entity0 from " @entity7 " who said he received money from merchandising is @entity193 , who replaced @entity194 as @entity195 is the second season			1
@entity193 said he received about $ 1,100 , after his mother demanded payment from the studio			0
the other cast members contacted by @entity0 said they either did n't have a merchandising clause in their contracts or do not remember getting paid			0
@entity1 's comments to @entity0 follow interviews earlier this year with cast members of " @entity206 , " who are suing @entity208 over the same issue			0
actors @entity210 , @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 , as well as the widow of actor @entity216 , filed a $ 10 million suit in april , claiming @entity208 , which owns the show , failed to pay them for " @entity206 " merchandise , which is still being sold around the world			2
after the lawsuit was filed , @entity208 sent checks to the actors totaling $ 43,403			2
but @entity224 , the actors ' attorney , said he would not cash the checks while the case is pending because that would imply his clients agree with @entity208 that is all they are owed			0
" in a statement , @entity208 said it agreed the actors are owed money for the merchandise , but dispute the amount			0
in a court filing , the company said the actors are " attempting to generate a lucrative litigation windfall by riddling their complaint with unsupported and overreaching causes of action " for fraud and breach of good faith			0
@entity208 said this was " all done in a transparent attempt to introduce the specter of punitive damages " in the case			0
but the actors fired back in court papers , saying " although defendants routinely rebrand their corporate images , they should not be permitted to rebrand the truth			0
" for @entity1 , he said the issue with " @entity7 " is the same -- where did all the merchandising money go ? " i 'm asking for fairness , i 'm asking to be treated with respect as opposed to , ' we do n't owe you anything , ' " @entity1 said .			1
