@entity0 -- @entity3 's parents wanted a safe place for their son to attend school where he would n't be harassed for being gay			1
they found that place in the @entity8			0
" it 's just been really accepting in my experience , " says @entity3 , a high school junior			1
he says he 's " never really dealt with bullying issues " in middle school or high school			1
" the amount of positive reaction to @entity17 issues is really amazing			1
" @entity19 administrators admit that by no means has bullying been eradicated from their schools			0
however , they firmly believe that they are leading the way in creating a safe environment for all students			0
in january , the school board unanimously passed a unique resolution instructing administrators to track bullying incidents related to the harassment of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender students			1
the measure also requires all staff to be trained on @entity17 issues			1
it injects @entity17 topics into the curriculum , which includes adding an @entity17 component to sex ed. they will eventually add an elective high school course on @entity17 history			1
just a few miles away , another @entity0 - area school district has attracted national attention for its policy that deals with lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender students much differently			1
neutral or not ? the @entity47 , just outside the @entity48 , made headlines in recent years after seven students committed suicide between november 2009 and may 2011			0
parents and friends say four of those students were either gay , perceived to be gay or questioning their sexuality			1
they say , at least two of them were bullied because of their sexuality			2
the school district says there is no evidence that the suicides were linked to bullying			1
nevertheless , it stirred public debate over the school 's sexual orientation curriculum policy			1
the district 's curriculum policy , adopted in 2009 , bars teachers from taking a position on homosexuality in the classroom and says such matters are best addressed outside of school			1
it 's become known as the neutrality policy			1
@entity78 - @entity77 , which encompasses the @entity48 ' northwestern suburbs and is the state 's largest school district , is the only @entity84 school district known to have such a policy			1
in july , gay rights advocates filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of a group of students challenging the neutrality policy			1
the @entity90 and the @entity91 told @entity1 that the lawsuit is currently in mediation			0
while the school district refrained from commenting on specifics in the lawsuit , it issued a statement in july noting that " @entity99 has been recognized as a pro-active leader in the state of @entity102 on bullying prevention			1
" the school district is also in the middle of a federal investigation into " allegations of harassment and discrimination in the @entity110 based on sex , including peer - on - peer harassment based on not conforming to gender stereotypes , " according to a district memo			2
superintendent @entity115 says the neutrality policy -- which has attracted just as many local supporters as it has critics to heated school board meetings -- is a reasonable response to a divided community			1
" it 's a diverse community , " @entity115 told @entity1 earlier this year , " and what we 're trying to do , what i 'm trying to do as a superintendent , is walk down the @entity121			2
" the school district has a separate , comprehensive bullying prohibition policy , and @entity115 said there is no link between the suicides and bullying			1
" we have no evidence that bullying or harassment took place in any of those cases , " the superintendent said			0
@entity115 emphasized students need to report bullying , and he acknowledged " gay students in our district struggle with bullying and harassment on a daily basis			2
" @entity145 , 16 , knows that all too well			0
he says he was a target for bullies because his father , a middle school teacher in the @entity149 , is gay			2
@entity145 's story @entity151 had adopted @entity145 just before he started high school			2
" it upsets me a great deal , " says @entity145 , a middle school theater teacher			2
" for him , being a kid from the foster system ... i was just really upset that he was n't being allowed to celebrate the fact that he had a family now			0
" @entity145 said the harassment went on for a full year before he even told his dad			0
" students would say stuff to me ... like ' hey , did your dad rape you last night ? ' you know , just make those kinds of jokes at me , " @entity145 said			0
the bullying was n't just directed at him			0
he says it was a general hostility toward people who are -- or are perceived to be -- @entity17 or who come from homes where a family member may be @entity17			2
" i pulled him out of [ that school ] , " @entity145 said			0
@entity145 now attends another school in the @entity78 - @entity99 district with smaller class sizes			2
he says he has n't had any problems			0
@entity145 , an adviser to his school 's @entity182 , says when he first started working at the school , several teachers suggested he keep his sexuality to himself for his own job security			1
he decided it did n't make sense to keep quiet			2
risking his job is a gamble he says he has to take because the issue is too important			0
" i just compare it to what these kids ' personal stories are , and they 've got stories far worse than anything that 's happening to me , " @entity145 said			0
in his adviser role , @entity145 says he receives phone calls , texts and @entity203 messages several times a week from students who feel like they are at a dead end because of bullying or uncertainty regarding their sexuality			0
@entity145 believes the school district 's neutrality policy has indirectly taken the side of the bullies by not supporting these kids			1
" some of the things we 've put in place [ have ] just created a scary environment , " @entity145 said			0
making it better @entity219 used to bully kids when he was in school , calling other boys " gay " for no particular reason			2
" if you did something on the athletic field that was n't masculine or manly , you 'd use the term ' that 's gay ' or the ' f ' word -- the other ' f ' word , " @entity219 recalled			1
today , @entity219 is the director of @entity232 's @entity231 , which seeks to " integrate equity , diversity , and inclusion into all aspects " of the school district			1
@entity219 says his past is why he believes so passionately in putting an end to bullying , particularly of students who are perceived to be gay			0
" what 's important for me is acknowledging that that happened and making it better for another generation of students , " @entity219 said			0
the @entity232 has taken many steps to address the issue of bullying @entity17 students , including training its staff on tracking bullying of these students , injecting @entity17 topics into the curriculum , hosting an " @entity257 " lgbt support program , and implementing a bullying prevention curriculum called @entity259			1
" it 's very special , " @entity219 said			0
" i think we 're a national leader when it comes to making sure that students and families in the school system @entity264 are being treated and valued equally amongst all students			0
" anti-bullying curriculum is woven into subjects like math , history and literature throughout each day , and staff from the teachers to the bus drivers are trained on how to create role play scenarios , says coordinator @entity277			0
ultimately it comes down to how each teacher feels they 're best able to infuse the lessons into their already planned lessons on other topics , she says			0
high school junior @entity3 says he notices bits and pieces of an @entity17 inclusive curriculum on a regular basis			1
" in my @entity290 class right now , at the end of the year we 're gon na be reading a book called ' @entity293 , ' which is all about a bisexual character living in @entity295 , and it hinges on a lot of his relationships , " he said			0
" and there are a couple of other books like that that deal with lesbianism			0
" his parents support the school 's proactive stance in teaching tolerance and offering support of @entity17 students like their son			1
however , they say any policy is ultimately " a piece of paper " that wo n't work unless the message is embraced by everyone			2
" it is our public officials , it 's our media , it is each of us individually saying it 's not ok to be hurtful to somebody else , " said @entity319			2
" whether its @entity17 or other issues kids experience , they should be able to be safe , and we should n't have to even think that we have to talk about that			1
" @entity1 's @entity333 , @entity334 , and @entity335 contributed to this report			0

@entity3 's parents wanted to make sure he was n't bullied for being gay
they *enrolled* him in a public school that has taken steps to teach @entity17 tolerance
a few miles away , another district is under *scrutiny* for its " neutrality " policy
that policy bars teachers from taking a position on homosexuality in the classroom
