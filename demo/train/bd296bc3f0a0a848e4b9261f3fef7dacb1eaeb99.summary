@entity0 -- rep. @entity2 , an @entity3 war veteran , kicked off a push wednesday to persuade @entity5 that the president should repeal " do n't ask , do n't tell , " the policy that prevents openly gay troops from serving in the @entity5 military			1
rep. @entity2 , a veteran of the @entity3 war , says it is time to end " do n't ask , do n't tell			0
" @entity2 , @entity12 , appeared along with several gay , lesbian and straight service members to launch the initiative			2
" we can not afford to wait any longer " for the policy 's repeal , @entity2 said at the @entity17 in @entity0			1
" now is the time to change this , when our military is stretched so thin " with wars in @entity3 and @entity23			1
a " @entity26 " tour , sponsored by the @entity25 , will travel across the country , sharing stories of gay , lesbian and straight servicemen and - women in hopes of garnering support for the @entity35 , which would repeal the law that established the policy			1
the act would allow gay and lesbian @entity5 to serve in the military without concealing their sexuality			2
@entity25 president @entity41 said in a statement , " we must repeal this discriminatory policy and ensure that our military can recruit and retain the best and the brightest troops regardless of their sexual orientation			1
" president @entity46 has said he wants @entity47 to repeal the law , but gay rights groups have been angered that the president has not done more to hasten the change			1
since @entity46 took office , 287 service members have been discharged for being gay , according to the @entity55 , which supports the repeal			2
the bill , introduced by @entity58 in 1993 and signed into law by president @entity60 , ended the protocol requiring service members to state their sexual orientation			1
but @entity58 now says the time has come to review whether the policy is still necessary			1
" sixteen years have now gone by , and i think a lot has changed with respect to attitudes within our country , and therefore i think this is a policy and a law that should be reviewed , " @entity58 said			1
" i am withholding judgment , because the commanders of the armed forces of the @entity5 and the @entity75 need to study it and make recommendations to the president and have hearings before the @entity47 before a decision is made , " he added			1
the military 's top uniformed officer , adm. @entity81 , said wednesday that it 's clear the president wants the law changed and that he is beginning to work with his staff on how a repeal would be implemented			1
but , he advised , with two wars ongoing , that the decision not be hurried			2
" when i talk about looking at this in the future , we have a force that 's under extraordinary stress , and it 's a force that , you know , should this occur , i think we need to implement in a way that is -- that recognizes the challenges and the stress that we 're under right now , " said the chairman of the @entity75			2
" but , if it does occur , when it does occur , you know , i 'll certainly lead it and carry it out			0
" defense secretary @entity104 recently said he is looking for ways to make the policy " more humane , " including letting people serve who may have been outed because of vengeance or a jilted lover			0
but there is plenty of opposition to the repeal			0
in the spring , more than 1,000 retired officers signed a letter organized by @entity117 and general officers for the @entity35 urging @entity46 to uphold the law			2
" we believe that imposing this burden on our men and women in uniform would undermine recruiting and retention , impact leadership at all levels , have adverse effects on the willingness of parents who lend their sons and daughters to military service , and eventually break the all - volunteer force , " the letter said			0
the recent shooting death of a sailor has also raised questions about acceptance of gays among troops			0
the family of seaman august provost of @entity143 , @entity144 , said they believe that he was killed because of his sexual orientation and his race			1
but a spokesman for @entity149 , where the shooting took place , said there was no indication early in the investigation that the killing was a hate crime			0
still , @entity157 , a straight veteran of @entity158 and the founder of @entity5 women 's veterans , said she believes that not much would change in the military if " do n't ask , do n't tell " were repealed			0
@entity162 appeared with @entity2 at the event wednesday in @entity0			0
calling them service members of a " new era , " @entity162 said , " gays have been and are already serving openly			0
... allowing discrimination and bigotry to continue is what disrupts cohesion			0
" there is no clear timeline for when the bill will be debated in @entity47			0
@entity46 has said he will sign the repeal if it comes to his desk .			0
