-- according to a time / @entity3 research poll released last week , 40 percent of @entity1 believe that marriage is becoming obsolete , up from just 28 percent in 1978			1
in that same poll , only one in four unmarried @entity1 say they do not want to get married			1
and among currently married men and women , 80 percent say their marriage is as close as or closer than their parents ' marriage			1
these seemingly contradictory responses reflect the public 's recognition of a new and complex reality			0
on the one hand , marriage as a voluntary relationship based on love and commitment is held in higher regard than ever , with more people saying that love is essential to marriage ( consider that in 1967 , two - thirds of college women said they 'd consider marrying a man they did n't love if he met other criteria , such as offering respectability and financial security			1
) but as an institution that regulates people 's lives , marriage is no longer the social and economic necessity it once was			1
people can construct successful lives outside marriage in ways that would have been very difficult to manage 50 years ago , and they have a far greater range of choices about whether to marry , when to marry , and how to organize their marriages			1
this often makes them more cautious in committing to marriage and more picky about their partners than people were in the past			1
in the 1950s , when half of all @entity1 women were already married in their teens , marriage was an almost mandatory first step toward adulthood			1
it was considered the best way to make a man grow up , and in an economy where steady jobs and rising real wages were widely available , that often worked			0
for a woman , marriage was deemed the best investment she could make in her future , and in a world where even college - educated women earned less than men with a only a high school education , that often worked for her too			1
marriage was also supposed to be the only context in which people could regularly have sex or raise children			1
divorced or unmarried men were routinely judged less qualified for bank loans or job promotions , sexually active single women were stigmatized , and out - of - wedlock children had few legal rights			0
today , however , there are plenty of other ways to grow up , seek financial independence , and meet one 's needs for companionship and sex			2
so what might have seemed a " good enough " reason to enter marriage in the past no longer seems sufficient to many people			2
marriage has become another step , perhaps even the final rather than the first step , in the transition to adulthood -- something many people will not even consider until they are very sure they are capable of taking their relationship to a higher plane			2
couples increasingly want to be certain , before they marry , that they can pay their bills , that neither party is burdened by debt , that each has a secure job or a set of skills attesting to their employability			2
many are also conscious that as rigid gender roles erode , marriage demands more negotiation and relationship skills than in the past			1
they often want firsthand experience with how their partner will behave in an intimate relationship , which is why the majority of new marriages come after a period of cohabitation , according to census figures			0
these higher expectations are good news for many marriages			2
people who can meet the high bar that most @entity1 now feel is appropriate for the transition to marriage -- people who delay marriage to get an education , who have accumulated a nest egg or established themselves in a secure line of work -- typically have higher quality marriages than other @entity1 , research shows , and their divorce rates have been falling for the past 25 years			1
but these higher expectations pose difficulties for individuals with fewer interpersonal and material resources			2
over the past 30 years , job opportunities and real wages have declined substantially for poorly educated men , making them less attractive marriage partners for women			2
when such men do find stable employment , they often tend to be more interested in a woman with good earnings prospects than someone they have to rescue from poverty			0
today , several studies have shown , economic instability is now more closely associated with marital distress than it used to be			2
if a low - income woman finds a stable , employed partner , she will likely be better off by marrying			0
but if the man she marries loses his job or is less committed and responsible than she had hoped , she may end up worse off than before -- having to support a man who ca n't or wo n't pull his own weight			0
so the widening economic gap between haves and have - nots that @entity1 has experienced in recent decades is increasingly reflected in a widening marriage gap as well			1
today two - thirds of people with a college degree are married , compared with less than half of those with a high school degree or less			0
those who begin married life with the most emotional and material advantages reap the greatest gains in those same areas from marriage			2
the very people who would benefit most from having a reliable long - term partner are the ones least likely to be able to find such a partner or sustain such a relationship			0
this is a troubling trend that deserves attention from policy - makers			0
but the problem does not lie in a lack of family values			0
the poor value marriage just as highly as anyone else , and they may value children even more			0
unfortunately , they are now less and less likely to believe they will be able to live up to the high expectations of modern partnerships , even if they are in love			0
there is no easy fix for this problem			0
but the good news is that families still matter to @entity1 , including those who are not married			1
according to the @entity3 poll , 76 percent of @entity1 say family is the most important , meaningful part of their life			1
seventy - five percent say they are " very satisfied " with their family life			0
and 85 percent say that the family they live in today , whatever its form , is as close as or closer than the family in which they grew up			0
we have a lot of challenges ahead of us , but that 's comforting news			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

40 percent of adults in study say marriage becoming obsolete , yet most say they want to marry
@entity227 asks , why the *disconnect* ?
she cites *changed* gender roles , raised expectations for financial stability in marriage
@entity227 : widening economic gap in @entity1 is reflected in marriage gap
