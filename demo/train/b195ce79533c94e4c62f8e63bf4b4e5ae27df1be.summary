-- accusations of lies and counter-lies dominated the intensifying november election campaign thursday , with surrogates and spokespeople for president @entity7 and certain @entity9 nominee @entity8 trying to cast the other as dishonest and secretive			1
while neither candidate engaged directly in the political back - and - forth , their teams and supporters launched new attack ads and criticized the opposing contender with increasingly sharp rhetoric			0
senate majority leader @entity18 , @entity19 , said @entity8 could n't be confirmed as a dogcatcher because he refuses to make public more of his past income tax returns , while @entity8 adviser @entity22 labeled as a lie some @entity7 ads that accused the former @entity26 governor of outsourcing jobs when he headed @entity28			1
" another day , another @entity7 campaign falsehood , " said the headline of a statement by the @entity8 campaign			1
@entity8 was scheduled to speak later thursday at a fundraiser organized by former vice president @entity34 , while @entity7 declined an invitation to address the @entity37 national convention in @entity38 , sending vice president @entity39 instead			1
@entity7 's campaign blamed a scheduling conflict for his unavailability to speak to the nation 's largest @entity44 advocacy group			2
the president 's schedule for thursday initially appeared wide open , but a senior administration official confirmed thursday morning that @entity7 and the first lady were being interviewed by @entity50 later in the day			1
at the convention , a short videotape from the president urged delegates to " keep standing with me			0
" on the campaign trail , the competing charges of lying involved claims by each camp that the other candidate has been more responsible for sending @entity61 jobs overseas , as well as a longstanding and previously discredited accusation that @entity8 remained at the private equity firm for three years longer than he has said			1
@entity8 says he ceded control at @entity28 in february 1999 in preparation to run the @entity67 in @entity68			2
however , the @entity69 reported thursday that documents filed with the @entity71 stated that @entity8 owned 100 % of the company until as late as 2002 @entity0 confirmed that an @entity71 filing from 2001 also listed @entity8 as the " sole shareholder , sole director , chief executive officer and president of @entity28			1
" in addition , @entity0 obtained from a @entity80 official a @entity28 filing with the @entity26 secretary of state 's office in 2001 that listed @entity8 as @entity28 president as well as a director			1
the document was @entity28 's annual foreign corporation report for calendar year 2000 , signed by @entity28 treasurer @entity88			2
@entity8 's campaign spokeswoman , @entity89 , said the @entity69 article " is not accurate " and insisted the candidate left his management role at the company in 1999 " as @entity28 has said , as gov. @entity8 has said , and as has been confirmed by independent fact checkers multiple times			1
" @entity95 , @entity28 managing partner , told @entity0 on thursday that @entity8 had " absolutely no involvement with the management or investment activities " of the firm after his february 1999 exit , but continued to be the sole stockholder			2
" due to the sudden nature of mr. @entity8 's departure , he remained the sole stockholder for a time while formal ownership was being documented and transferred to the group of partners who took over management of the firm in 1999 , " @entity95 said			1
" accordingly , mr. @entity8 was reported in various capacities on @entity71 filings during this period			2
" the timing of his end date at the firm remains an important focal point in the presidential race , as @entity8 argues he left the company before it was involved with the shuttering of certain businesses that led to job losses			2
@entity7 's re-election campaign quickly seized on the @entity69 report , arguing it was possible proof that @entity8 " has n't been telling the truth " about his exit from @entity28			1
" either @entity8 , through his own words and his own signature was misrepresenting his position at @entity28 to the @entity71 , which is a felony , or he was misrepresenting his position at @entity28 to the @entity44 people to avoid responsibility for some of the consequences of his investments , " said @entity7 deputy campaign manager @entity130			1
" if that 's the case , if he was lying to the @entity44 people , then that 's a real character and trust issue that the @entity44 people need to take very seriously			0
" the @entity8 camp reacted quickly , with campaign manager @entity145 calling @entity130 's remark " a reckless and unsubstantiated charge " that was " so over the top that it calls into question the integrity of their entire campaign			2
" " president @entity7 ought to apologize for the out - of - control behavior of his staff , which demeans the office he holds , " @entity145 continued			1
" campaigns are supposed to be hard fought , but statements like those made by @entity130 belittle the process and the candidate on whose behalf she works			0
" the nonpartisan group @entity166 said it previously looked into the matter of when @entity8 left @entity28 and concluded there was insufficient evidence to show that @entity8 was still managing the company , even part - time , during his time with the @entity173			1
" we would reassess our judgment should somebody come up with evidence that @entity8 took part in any specific management decision or had any active role ( not just a title ) at @entity28 after he left to head the @entity173 , " said @entity174 , the director of @entity166			2
@entity174 added : " but in our considered judgment , nothing in the @entity69 story directly contradicts @entity8 's statements , which he has certified as true under pain of federal prosecution , that he ' has not had any active role ' with @entity28 or ' been involved in the operations ' of @entity28 since then			1
" @entity7 's campaign also has been calling on @entity8 to release more than the two years ' worth of tax documents he has already made public , suggesting the candidate may be hiding important details about his finances			1
in a statement thursday , @entity130 questioned whether @entity8 was concealing his tax documents " because there is still more about this period and beyond that he does n't want people to know			0
" the chief of the @entity203 ' campaign arm said thursday it was reasonable for people to ask for more information about @entity8 's personal financial records			1
" his personal finances , the way he does things , his record , are fair game , " @entity209 @entity9 @entity208 told @entity0			1
so far , the former @entity26 governor has released his 2010 tax records and an estimate for 2011 , but he has filed an extension for his 2011 taxes			0
in an interview on @entity221 on wednesday , @entity8 said he 'll release the most recent information " as soon as they 're prepared			0
" @entity8 has an estimated net worth of more than $ 250 million			0
meanwhile , @entity8 's campaign released a new television ad thursday accusing @entity7 of spreading " dishonest attacks " that @entity28 specialized in advising companies on outsourcing while @entity8 was its head			1
the new @entity8 ad noted that @entity166 said there is " no evidence " that @entity8 was directly responsible for shipping jobs overseas while he headed the company			0
@entity7 's campaign has pressed the point in its own attack ads , and the president told an @entity241 crowd tuesday that " gov. @entity8 has experience owning companies that were called ' pioneers ' in the business of outsourcing			1
" in an interview thursday on @entity248 , @entity22 of the @entity8 campaign said the @entity7 ads " have been shown to be demonstrably false and that 's , you know , that 's another way of saying a lie , obviously			1
" @entity22 's comment showed the growing role of surrogates for the candidates in launching campaign attacks			0
@entity18 , who said wednesday that @entity8 would fail to win @entity261 approval as a @entity263 member because he wo n't reveal more than two years of his tax returns , went a step further thursday			0
" he not only could n't be confirmed as a @entity263 secretary , he could n't be confirmed as dogcatcher , " @entity18 said			0
" as a dogcatcher , you 'd at least want to get a look at his tax returns			0
" meanwhile , house speaker @entity271 , @entity272 , went after @entity7 during his weekly news conference , accusing the president of giving stimulus money to companies that did business overseas instead of in the @entity61 during a recession			2
however , a fact check by the @entity280 showed there was little evidence that companies receiving federal money used it to pay workers overseas			0
@entity7 got some good news thursday , with the number of people filing for initial unemployment claims falling to a four - year low			2
but the president remains vulnerable on his handling of the economy , identified as the biggest issue on the minds of voters , because of the 8.2 % unemployment rate and weak growth			0
a top independent conservative group , @entity300 , announced thursday it was going up with its second straight television commercial slamming @entity7 over the high unemployment rate			0
the group , which was co-founded by conservative operative @entity304 , says the commercial is part of an $ 8 million ad buy targeting battleground states			0
@entity300 is the sister organization to @entity309 , the independent super pac that backs @entity9 causes and candidates			0
@entity300 has spent tens of millions of dollars to run ads critical of the president and supportive of @entity9 lawmakers and candidates in crucial @entity261 contests			2
in his remarks to the @entity37 , @entity39 focused on voting rights , arguing that @entity9 were making it more difficult for people to vote			1
by implementing laws requiring voters to present official identification at the voting booth , @entity39 said , the @entity9 sees " a different future , where voting is made harder , not easier			2
" @entity80 have said that such laws are politically motivated and intended to suppress minority voting			0
@entity9 have said the laws prevent fraud and protect the integrity of the system			0
the issue was a hot topic this week at the @entity37 convention , where attorney general @entity334 spoke tuesday and lambasted states that have considered or attempted to implement such laws , including @entity209 , @entity336 and @entity337			0
appealing to the group 's founding , @entity39 on thursday urged the crowd to " remember what ( the @entity37 ) at its core was all about			1
" " it was about the right to vote , because when you have the right to vote , you have the right to change things , " he said			0
@entity39 's speech came one day after @entity8 was booed during his own remarks to the group when he vowed to repeal the @entity352 , @entity7 's signature health care law			1
in comparison , @entity39 drew thunderous applause thursday after trumpeting health care reform and emphasized that the law ensures coverage to " 8 million black @entity61 who never would have had insurance			0
" @entity0 's @entity359 , @entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity365 and @entity366 contributed to this report .			0
