@entity0 -- prosecutors hope to determine by @entity3 whether @entity5 's first family broke any laws regarding a gift - giving scandal that has engulfed gov. @entity8 and tarnished the once - sterling reputation of the @entity11 politician , a source with knowledge of the matter told @entity1			1
lawyers for @entity8 and his wife met with prosecutors in the city of @entity19 on monday as the @entity20 sought clarity over previously undisclosed gifts given to the governor and his family by the chief executive of a troubled dietary supplement company			1
@entity8 had no comment on the meetings			2
the desire to reach some kind of conclusion about the direction of the investigation in coming weeks revolves around the @entity5 election in november to chose @entity8 's successor			1
the @entity20 generally avoids bringing cases against politicians if it might impact an election			0
that race is one of the nastiest gubernatorial contests in the country			0
it 's between @entity11 attorney general @entity44 , who has his own ties to the man behind the @entity8 scandal , and @entity49 @entity48 , a heavyweight political fundraiser , businessman and close friend of @entity53 and @entity54			1
it has been a stunning turn of events for @entity8 , a well mannered former star in @entity11 politics who rose from state legislator to @entity5 attorney general to governor			1
@entity8 's future was so bright not long ago			1
he won the governorship handily in 2009 and had maintained his popularity in a southern presidential battleground state that votes blue , but just barely			0
his fundraising acumen , message discipline and understated charm helped lift him to the chairmanship of the @entity73 in 2011 , a post other governors have used as a springboard to a presidential campaign			0
he was mentioned as a possible running mate for @entity77			0
" clearly @entity8 has had a great interest in national office			2
it was clear following his landslide victory for governor , " said @entity80 , columnist for the @entity81			0
but things came apart this year over revelations about the first family 's ties to @entity89 , a friend and campaign contributor			2
questions center on gifts : $ 15,000 for catering costs for @entity8 's daughter 's wedding , $ 15,000 for clothing purchases for his wife , @entity97 , and $ 6,500 for a @entity99 watch			1
@entity100 also bought stock in the company and promoted its products at a luncheon at the governor 's mansion in @entity107			1
a key question remains : did @entity8 accept things of value in exchange for official acts -- which he denies -- or did he willfully turn a blind eye to gifts for his wife ? @entity8 maintains he did n't know about the gifts or the stock and has denied wrongdoing			1
@entity8 said he has already repaid @entity89 tens of thousands of dollars and said he has broken no laws			2
he and his allies have cautiously defended the lack of disclosure as consistent with @entity5 law , which does not require elected officials to report gifts provided to family members like @entity8 's wife and daughter			1
elected officials in @entity5 are allowed to accept gifts over $ 50 , as long as they are publicly disclosed			0
@entity8 has reported other gifts from @entity89 , including a stay at a lake house and private plane travel			1
@entity89 has also given generously to @entity8 's political organization			1
@entity136 , a former @entity137 attorney in @entity19 , told @entity1 this would be a very difficult case for prosecutors without clear evidence of a quid pro quo			0
" you have the money aspect , and you have the receipt of the money , what i do n't see for a federal crime right now is the governor acting in his official capacity in order to aid @entity153 , in exchange for the money , " said @entity143			2
there are calls for @entity8 to step down , but he said in july that he plans to finish his term			2
although prosecutors apparently do not like for these kinds of investigations to impact elections , @entity44 has not escaped the controversy			0
he owned stock in @entity89 ' company but sold off shares earlier this year			0
he also collected more than $ 18,000 in gifts from the executive and stayed at his vacation house			0
an ethics investigation of @entity44 's relationship with @entity89 cleared the attorney general of any wrongdoing but revealed that @entity44 put the executive in touch with an attorney who could help him win grants from a state agency			0
resignation would solve one problem , create another @entity1 's @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
