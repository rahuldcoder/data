" this challenge and ambition is strictly a sports investment and one that looks to benefit the club and its fans , '' said an @entity10 statement regarding @entity8 's intervention			1
" ( the investment ) will try to support @entity28 's players so they can reach their goals and the club can reach the division that corresponds to its history and values			2
'' in september @entity8 bought 30 % stakes in two @entity40 football teams , @entity58 and @entity59 , and he plans to use @entity10 " to create synergies and exchanges between @entity33 , @entity40 and @entity62			1

his widespread interests include providing financial backing for @entity40 @entity71 driver @entity70			2
" naturally , i have reservations , doubts & concerns , " tweeted @entity34 on saturday			2
" but with c. € 2m of shares bought by 13,000 + ppl round world & @entity8 buying € 2m @entity28 safe			1
