-- birders define " a big year " as an informal competition to see who can spot the most species of birds in a certain area in a calendar year			1
let me start off with a disclaimer : i am a bit of a bird nerd			1
not a serious birder by any stretch ( i have never gone on vacation specifically for the birds , for example ... well , not a long one , anyway ) , but my @entity17 has been known to contain more than a few shots of birds , and my @entity20 does have @entity21			2
oh , and as a child , my dad and i would spend the occasional summer afternoon in the country listening to records of bird calls			1
however , just because i like birds does n't mean i am predisposed to liking a movie with a lot of birds in it			2
i am a huge baseball fan too , but am perfectly able to recognize a bad baseball movie when i see one			2
" @entity35 , " anyone ? in addition , a good film needs to have something to it in addition to the surface subject matter			1
what i am trying to say is , just because this is a film about birding does n't mean it 's a film about birding			1
@entity48 ( @entity49 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 ) and @entity52 ( @entity53 ) are three birders who may ( or may not ) be attempting a @entity55			1
the thing is , it 's such a competitive field that those attempting such a feat tend to keep the information to themselves , so as to not inspire the competition			1
paying possum is a big part of a @entity55			2
the head of a corporation , @entity48 is nearing retirement age			2
he wants to quit the rat race , do something for himself ( a @entity55 , natch ) and settle down in @entity69 with his wife , @entity70 ( @entity71 )			2
of course his corporate underlings , smarmily played by @entity73 and @entity74 , continuously try to pull him off the road and into the board room			2
@entity50 , in his mid- 30s and divorced , is low on funds and morale			0
he 's stuck in a job he hates and aches to do something truly great			0
as a birder , this means breaking the world record held by @entity52 ( almost always referred to by his surname with a mix of derision , awe and envy by his fellow birders )			0
for @entity48 and @entity50 , while the undertaking of a @entity55 is exciting , it 's also a means to an end , not the end itself , and the journey is at least as important as the result			0
one of the joys of this film is watching their excitement when some @entity101 o weather phenomena means that there 's a likelihood of a mass of grounded birds ( a storm in @entity107 ) or a super rare sighting ( a pink - footed goose , rarely seen in the @entity110 )			1
to the arrogant and absurdly colorfully attired @entity52 , however , the @entity55 is personal and more about him than it is about the birds			0
it 's his record , and his status as world champion is more important to him than anything , even his devoted wife , @entity117 ( @entity118 )			0
@entity52 is constantly promising to hang up his binoculars and start a family , only to receive a call with a rare bird sighting somewhere across the country and hit the road again			2
@entity48 and @entity50 quickly become friends and repeatedly run into each other throughout the year in far - flung parts of the continent , and travel they do			0
" @entity144 " takes them from @entity130 to @entity131 to @entity132 to @entity133 , @entity134 , the westernmost island in the @entity136 , closer to @entity137 than it is to the @entity134 mainland ( of course the production did n't actually shoot there , but they did shoot in the @entity143 )			1
the scenery and wildlife on display are at times breathtaking			0
the thing is ( up on my avian soapbox , again ) , i can see the appeal			0
after all , birds are amazing creatures			0
they can fly , which is amazing in and of itself , and oh , by the way , is n't one of the most common dreams the one where you 're flying ? add to that their place in evolution , their diversity , strength and behavioral differences , and they 're pretty interesting creatures			0
while it 's mostly about the humans in the cast , the sheer number of birds on display ( stay for the running list during the closing credits ) is astonishing , with some quite interesting ( and in one case downright touching ) bits of bird trivia thrown in			1
it 's not hard to see how large groups of people could get caught up in the activity			0
in fact , a 2006 survey by the @entity110 @entity185 puts the number of birders nationwide at 48 million			0
that same year , the activity created 671,000 jobs and added $ 36 billion to the @entity110 economy			0
at the heart of " @entity144 " is the idea that we all have our passions , and why are any passions any weirder than any other ? surely , on a list of odd obsessions , birding ranks far below hoarding or , say , dyeing your dog to look like a panda			1
supporting turns are all solid , with special notice to the always lovely @entity206 as @entity207 , the female bird nerd who captures @entity50 's interest , and @entity209 as the comically and aptly named @entity210			1
@entity211 and @entity212 are perfectly cast as @entity50 's parents			0
if there 's ever been a non-related trio that looks more like a real family , i 'll eat my special birding hat			0
i do n't have one ... yet			0
" @entity144 " is a charming , uplifting and heartwarming film , and when it 's funny ( which is often ) , it 's very funny indeed			1
it has a simple but compelling story to which everyone , birders and non- , can relate , great chemistry between @entity49 and @entity51 , and a heart			1
it 's nice to see a film that does n't have a mean streak and also does n't talk to adults like they are idiots			1
" @entity144 " is rated pg. there 's a minor swear word or two , but that 's about it .			1

" @entity144 " stars @entity49 , @entity51 and @entity53
the title refers to a competition among bird watchers
the film *includes* a bit of bird trivia as well some nice supporting *performances*
