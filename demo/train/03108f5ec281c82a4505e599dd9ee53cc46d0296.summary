-- up to three @entity2 - infected travelers might board an international flight each month in @entity4 , according to a new study , and potentially spread the deadly virus to other countries			1
scientists used a model to predict that , on average , three people who are infected with @entity2 will leave @entity11 , @entity12 or @entity13 in each of the coming months to fly to another country			1
they based their model on scheduled flights for september 1 to december 31 , 2014 , historic flight itineraries from 2013 , and @entity2 surveillance numbers from the current outbreak			1
the results were published in @entity21 this week			0
" we understand there could be global risks associated with the current outbreak , " said study author dr. @entity22 , a specialist in infectious diseases and tropical medicine at the @entity25			0
" we wanted to understand what those risks were			0
" three passengers per month , or 2.8 to be exact , was around what @entity22 was expecting			2
considering the number of people living in these @entity4 countries , he says , the prevalence of the disease is still relatively low			1
@entity11 , for example , has around 11.4 million people , and just over 1,500 recorded cases of @entity2			1
nonessential travel to and from these countries has also been reduced significantly over the past six months			1
of the approximately 500,000 travelers who flew out of @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 in 2013 , more than half flew to one of five countries : @entity47 , @entity48 , the @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
in fact , the study authors say the likelihood of someone traveling to the @entity49 or @entity50 with @entity2 is about eight times higher than the likelihood of someone traveling to the @entity58 with the disease			2
of course , @entity2 has already come to the @entity58			2
the study authors note that the majority of people flying out of @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 are traveling to other low - or middle - income countries			1
as one hospital in the @entity58 has had some trouble preventing transmission , experts question whether less - equipped nations will be able to stop the virus			1
" if you look at how challenged the @entity58 has been in dealing with this one imported case , i think it 's really important for @entity78 and other countries to up the preparedness in areas where they might have less resources , " said dr. @entity70 , professor of medicine and infectious diseases at @entity73 , who was not involved with the study			2
the researchers also looked at the effectiveness of airport screenings in stopping the spread of the ebola virus			0
overall , they concluded that exit screening is more effective than screening passengers for @entity2 when they arrive in another country			2
exit screening at three airports is easier , @entity22 says , and requires fewer resources than doing entry screening at hundreds of airports around the globe			0
but even exit screening , he says , is unlikely to have much effect because of the virus ' long incubation period			0
someone can be infected with @entity2 for up to 21 days before becoming symptomatic			1
that 's how @entity104 made it to the @entity58 with the virus ; his temperature was taken before he boarded , but his symptoms did n't start until several days after his flight landed			0
airport screenings are " a control measure , but an imperfect control measure , " says dr. @entity113 , an expert on infectious diseases at @entity115			0
@entity113 compares it to making fresh - squeezed juice : airport screenings , from a fundamental public health point of view , he says , are " very much squeeze with very little juice			0
" the bottom line is that the vast majority of our resources , @entity22 said , should be focused on preventing the spread of infection in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			0
" if there are fewer cases in @entity4 , fewer ( infected ) people will be boarding planes to other parts of the world , " he says			1
" that said , we still have to be prepared elsewhere			0
because we know from experience that it can land on our doorstep			0
