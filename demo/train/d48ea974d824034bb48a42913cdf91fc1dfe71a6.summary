-- @entity1 and i first met as mid-level slaves to the fashion industry eight years ago			1
i recognized a kindred spirit the minute i caught her screaming harsh obscenities at her computer			2
we 've been through boyfriend breakups , apartment break - ins , and career changes			2
so when she asked me to be a bridesmaid , i jumped at the chance to stand by her side and watch her start a new life with the man she loved			1
of course , i wanted to support her in any way possible on her big day ; i just did n't realize how much it would cost me ! the @entity0 : 15 lies we need to stop telling each other the bachelorette party was my first indication of the financial obligation i agreed to			1
my plane ticket from @entity31 to @entity32 : $ 400			1
hotel on @entity33 : $ 300			2
dinner and drag show : $ 150			2
drinks at the bar : $ 200			2
@entity37 in @entity32 : unfortunately , not priceless			2
in addition to the bachelorette party , i spent a total of $ 1,500 on a dress i will never wear again , a gift for the bridal shower her future mother - in - law hosted , a gift and food for the naughty - themed bridal shower we , the bridesmaids , hosted ( the maid of honor 's idea ) , my plane ticket to @entity50 for the wedding , and my hotel room stay			1
the @entity0 : 10 super top - secret celebrity weddings as the numbers continued to add up , and my credit card statements kept increasing , i tried to keep it together , but all i could feel was resentment			1
she never acknowledged the cost , just smiled and expected me to participate			0
to tackle my mounting debt , i cut back on dinners out and replaced them with @entity68 noodles			0
i had tried to get out of the bridal party spa treatments she booked , but the pregnant pause and the chilly " umm ... okay , " she gave me over the phone made me feel like a bad friend			1
i gave in , of course , which not only made me mad at her , but mad at myself ! the @entity0 : my mom wants me to be skinny i did my best to stay supportive , but as my animosity rose , i saw the sweet , small town girl from @entity81 , @entity82 , as a flaming @entity83			1
every time she mentioned the wedding , i cringed			0
i began to avoid her phone calls and disregard her emails			1
i contemplated having a heart - to - heart with her , but i just did n't see it going well			0
the day before the wedding , @entity83 treated the bridesmaids to manicures and pedicures , and as her colors were black and white , she " encouraged " all of us to choose red for our nails			1
after she inspected my " @entity103 " - colored toes , i mentioned i was thinking of doing a nude color on my hands			0
everything turned to slow motion as her breath caught , her eyes widened , and her mouth squared to protest			1
before she could say anything , i grabbed the red polish and thrust it at the manicurist			0
her open mouth spread into a smile ... and she hugged me			0
the @entity0 : i 'm not really sold on monogamy in that moment i realized this was her @entity119 , and i did n't want to ruin our friendship over money and nail polish			0
she asked me to share in her wedding ; it was an ode to how important i am to her			1
i sucked it up and saw everything from another point of view			0
i got to party in @entity32 , chill by the pool in @entity50 , and be v.i.p. at all the wedding events			0
i had to admit it was fun			0
i put on my new attitude the next day			1
the wedding was beautiful and i made sure to look stunning in my $ 1,500 dress with the stiff , lampshade - like flair at the bottom that i will never wear again			0
i also made sure to drink $ 1,000 worth of champagne			0
and in the end i did n't mind cutting back and plunking down a few more bucks a month on my credit card , because i got to hold on to my good friend			2
the @entity0 : 8 celebrity dudes describe their dream woman @entity148 all rights reserved			0

the two women bonded over work , apartments and boyfriends
so when one got engaged , she asked the other to be a bridesmaid
but plane fares , hotels , dresses and other costs began to add up
*writer* says friend turned into @entity83 -- but she went along for one big day
