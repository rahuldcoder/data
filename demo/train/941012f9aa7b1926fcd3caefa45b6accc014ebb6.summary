-- for @entity4 , the cost of either meeting its commitments under the @entity3 , or failing to do so , was too much to bear			1
on monday , the country became the first signatory of the landmark climate treaty to back out of the deal , citing the huge potential cost of legally binding commitments			2
confirming the move , environment minister @entity11 said to meet its obligations under the accord @entity4 would have to take every single vehicle off its roads			1
" every car , truck , @entity29 , tractor , ambulance , police car , " he elaborated in a media briefing , before giving another equally unpalatable option of closing down the country 's entire farming and agricultural sector and cutting heat to every home , building and factory			0
if the country failed to do so , @entity11 said taxpayers would have to give $ 14 billion to other countries " with no impact on emissions or the environment			0
" how did it come to this ? @entity4 's move was not unexpected			2
since being elected into power in 2006 , prime minister @entity42 has made it clear he was not a supporter of the controversial pact			0
@entity4 quits climate pact the @entity3 was signed in 1997 by the previous @entity49 government , which committed @entity4 to cutting greenhouse gas emissions 6 % below 1990 levels by 2012			1
in fact , levels have been rising , according to readings submitted to the @entity55 ( @entity55 )			0
the announcement came after the end of the latest round of talks involving the 195 parties to the @entity55 in @entity61 , @entity62			2
@entity64 @entity63 ban ki - moon had just finished saying that a " significant agreement " had been reached , which has been dubbed " the @entity66 , " when @entity4 pulled the plug			2
but while @entity69 repeated his claim that @entity71 , for @entity4 , " is in the past , " he described @entity72 as " the way forward			1
" what is the @entity66 ? the new deal , agreed sunday , brings in major emitters of greenhouse gas emissions including the @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			2
for that , it was hailed a success , although critics still argue that the timetable is too loose			0
the parties agreed to extend the @entity3 , which was due to expire at the end of 2012 , and to discuss a legally binding pact to cover all major emitters by 2015 , with any agreed deal to start in 2020			1
" right now the global climate regime amounts to nothing more than a voluntary deal that 's put off for a decade , " said @entity92 , the international executive director of environmental campaign group @entity93			2
" this could take us over the two degree threshold where we pass from danger to potential catastrophe			0
" the package includes the first contributions to a $ 100 billion @entity105 to help developing countries to invest in clean energy and adapt to climate change			1
an @entity109 will be formed to co-ordinate adaptation activities worldwide with agreement on a " @entity112 " to smooth the way			0
what impact will @entity4 's departure have on the treaty ? @entity4 is just one of the 41 " @entity120 " countries and the @entity119 to have ratified the @entity3 , and its departure is not expected to lead to any kind of collapse			1
however , its decision to formally leave the pact does send a symbolic message to other countries which might be looking for a way out , according to @entity93			0
" the @entity3 is still quite shaky with many countries wanting to jump out of the ship			2
this @entity4 position to leave behind the @entity3 does destabilize the positive action , " said @entity131 , the group 's climate and energy manager in @entity135			1
@entity131 said the new deal , to be agreed before 2015 , will also include legally binding commitments so countries that opt out now are only delaying the financial pain			1
" there really is no escape from the responsibility , " she added			0
opinion : @entity146 needs climate change ' @entity148 ' which countries could follow ? @entity150 and @entity151 have already made it clear they 're not in favor of extending the @entity3 , but are yet to formally pull out			1
@entity155 , spokesman for the @entity64 's @entity156 , said any further departures would seem premature with new the treaty negotiations underway , as agreed in @entity61			1
before the @entity61 talks , @entity150 's chief negotiator @entity159 said the @entity3 " neither resolves the problems of global warming , nor ensures meeting the global two - degree target , nor provides for environmental integrity			1
" the @entity78 has long refused to ratify the @entity3 on the grounds that it does n't bind other major emitters , including @entity79 , to legally binding limits			2
on tuesday , @entity135 expressed regret at the @entity4 decision			0
" it is regrettable and flies in the face of the efforts of the international community for @entity4 to leave the @entity3 at a time when the @entity61 meeting , as everyone knows , made important progress by securing a second phase of commitment to the protocol , " @entity171 spokesman @entity170 said at a news briefing , according to @entity173			1
what does the most recent science say ? leading scientists agree that the world is on a path to rising average global temperatures which could have a disastrous humanitarian and environmental impact			0
global carbon dioxide levels rose to an average of 389 parts per million in 2010 , compared with 386 ppm in 2009 , according to figures released in november by the @entity197 ( @entity197 )			0

extreme weather the norm in 2011 according to the @entity213 's ( @entity213 ) provisional status report , 2011 was the 10th warmest year on record and warmer than any other year with a @entity216 event			0
