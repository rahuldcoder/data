-- for ardent royalists and keen followers of the @entity5 celebrations , there could have been few more fitting tributes to the @entity9 monarch 's abiding reign than sunday 's 1000 - strong flotilla			1
the vast fleet of multi-colored , eccentrically - clad yachts - which included everything from ancient tall ships to @entity17 - style longboats -- was led by a gold - gilded barge carrying the queen herself , reflecting an intimate and centuries - old communion between the royal family and the high - seas			1
throughout history , @entity9 monarchs have relied on the country 's sea power to protect their kingdom and conquer new territories			1
during the 18th and 19th centuries their naval conquests ensured that the " sun never set " on its empire , but even though times have changed since then , the monarchy still enjoys a very special relationship with the symbolically titled @entity35			1
the queen 's husband , prince @entity36 , is its lord high admiral , while her son @entity39 holds the rank of @entity36 -- having taken command of his own ship in 1976			2
prince @entity43 is @entity44 and commodore - in - chief for @entity46 and @entity47 and completed an attachment with the @entity35 in 2008			2
the queen 's father , @entity49 , was the last @entity9 sovereign to have seen action in navy battle when , as a 20 - year - old sub-lieutenant in the @entity35 , he fought during the @entity55 in the @entity56 , may 1916			1
but it 's not just in the arena of naval warfare that the royals exhibit their maritime affections			2
there are probably few finer examples of a regal leisure boat than " @entity66 's @entity65 , " built especially for the queen in 1953			1
now decommissioned and on display in @entity70 , @entity46 , the vast and lavishly designed " @entity65 " has sailed over one million miles during 44 years of service over the course of 968 official royal visits			2
once described by @entity66 as " the one place where i can truly relax , " the royal yacht was built to many of her specifications			0
over the years it played host to the likes of sir @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 and has been used for four royal honeymoons - including @entity39 and princess @entity88 's 16 - day trip in the @entity89			1
back on the @entity90 , @entity9 monarchs have a long - standing tradition of using the winding river to celebrate different types of royal events such as processions , receptions , coronations , weddings and christenings			1
according to the @entity102 historians , @entity100 may have been the first @entity103 monarch to go to his coronation by water , rather than by land , in 1483			0
four years later @entity107 did n't spare any costs when his queen , @entity109 , was escorted up the river by a company of barges adorned with red , flame - breathing dragons			0
a generation later , @entity115 's coronation in 1533 was one of the grandest spectacles ever seen on the river			0
reports from the event suggest that it featured an impressive armada of more than 300 lavishly - apparelled vessels , and her leading barge contained a moving mechanical dragon -- complete with men dressed as monsters , casting fire towards the spectators on the riverbank			0
an altogether less frightening pageant was hosted by @entity133 , who commissioned @entity135 - born composer @entity134 to write him a piece for the event in 1717			0
the " water music " concert was performed for the king on his barge and , according newspaper reports of the time , he enjoyed it so much he ordered the 50 exhausted musicians to play the suites three times during the trip			0
" back then the @entity90 was the biggest boulevard in @entity152 , so if a monarch wanted to make an impression on the populous they would do it on the river , " said pageant master @entity148 , the man responsible for organizing sunday 's eye - popping event			1
as @entity9 began to industrialize , the number of royal pageants began to dwindle			1
at the time the river was virtually an open sewer , with the @entity162 once having to be abandoned because mps were " overpowered by the smell , " according to the official @entity102 website			0
the industrialization during the @entity168 era also meant the streets of @entity152 were paved and broadened to make way for machinery and traffic			0
" when the streets started to be redeveloped the event planners realized it was easier to do these types of celebrations on dry land , so they forgot about the river , " said @entity148			0
after decades of hard work to clean the @entity90 ,			2
it is now enjoying a new era of popularity			0
read more from @entity185 : ' queen of yachting ' captures sailing 's golden era on film " the relationship between the river and city has changed over the past 30 - 40 years			1
the @entity90 is now one of the cleanest metropolitan rivers in the world			2
the best new architecture in @entity152 is built on the riverbank 's edge , and a walk by the riverbank is one of the most popular things for tourists to do when they come to visit , " said @entity148			0
" i think it 's fabulous that the river has sunk back into the hearts of the city			0
so it makes absolute sense that the @entity211 pageant should be on the river , " he added			0
ultimately , the royal family 's love - affair with sailing vessels " comes down to the fact that @entity9 is an island nation " according to @entity214 , from the @entity215 @entity9 organization			1
pageant master @entity148 agrees , but says that the symbolic connection between royalty and the sea reflects a broader disposition embedded in the national psyche : " @entity9 ' relationship with water runs deep , and our characters have been forged by the canals and the rivers			1

the @entity9 royal family has a centuries - old relationship with boats and the sea
sunday 's flotilla most recent in a long line of regal celebrations on the @entity90
@entity9 's identity as a small island nation is significant in royal 's *affinity* with boats
