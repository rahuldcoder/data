pope @entity0 used a punch to make a point about the limits of free expression , but he ended up on the defensive because of it -- with a @entity9 spokesman saying it was " in no way intended to be interpreted as justification for the violence and terror that took place in @entity16 last week			1
" the @entity0 made the gesture and accompanying remarks while flying from @entity19 to the @entity20 , where he started a five - day visit thursday			2
he did n't mention @entity22 , the satirical magazine that was targeted by terrorists after it depicted the @entity24 in cartoons , something that many @entity27 find offensive			0
the @entity16 magazine became a terrorist target after publishing one such cartoon years ago , and after last week 's attack , it placed @entity24 on its cover , this time showing him crying and holding a sign with the rallying cry " @entity35 , " @entity36 for " i am @entity35			0
" still , even if he did n't explicitly name the publication , the @entity0 was clear that he was referring to the general debate over what 's happened in @entity36 , including how people might react if they feel someone made a slight to their religious faith			1
everyone has not only the liberty , but also the obligation , " to say what he thinks to help the common good , " @entity0 said			0
however , they should not do so if it offends people			0
and if someone does get offended ? the @entity0 made reference to @entity53 , a man who organizes papal trips and was then standing next to him on the plane			1
" if dr. @entity53 , a great friend , says a swear word against my mother , then a punch awaits him , " @entity0 said			1
" it 's normal , it 's normal			0
one can not provoke , one can not insult other people 's faith , one can not make fun of faith			0
" while making this comment , @entity66 reported that the pontiff " gestured with a pretend punch " directed at @entity69 -- an action many journalists interpreted as a joke			1
notably , in the same conversation , @entity0 steadfastly denounced the terrorists ' killings and the idea that anyone -- as the @entity36 attackers apparently did -- could pretend to justify such violence in the name of @entity82			1
" one can not make war ( or ) kill in the name of one 's own religion , " @entity0 said on his way to the @entity20			2
" ... to kill in the name of @entity82 is an aberration			0
" the @entity9 later responded to a @entity1 question about the " punch " remark specifically			2
in an email , @entity9 spokesman @entity92 told @entity1 that " the @entity0 's expression is in no way intended to be interpreted " as somehow justifying last week 's violence , and he pointed out that " the @entity0 has spoken out clearly against the terror and violence that occurred in @entity16 and in other parts of the world			1
" " the @entity0 's words about dr. @entity53 were spoken colloquially and in ( a ) friendly , intimate manner among colleagues and friends , " @entity92 said thursday			2
" his response might be similar to something each of us has felt when those dearest to us are insulted or harmed			0
" @entity92 explained @entity0 ' remarks as consistent with his " free style of speech , " a plainspoken and conversational approach that has earned him admirers			2
such remarks " must be taken at face value and not distorted or manipulated , " the @entity9 spokesman said			1
in fact , the @entity0 has been one of the world 's most outspoken advocates for peace and against war since taking that position in 2013			0
and what he said on the @entity125 - bound plane does n't change that , according to @entity92			0
" @entity0 has not advocated violence with his words on the flight , " the spokesman said .			1

pope @entity0 throws a pretend punch to make a point about how offended people may respond
he does so while *talking* about the @entity36 terror attacks and the debate over free expression
a @entity9 spokesman says @entity0 ' words did n't advocate violence or justify the attacks
