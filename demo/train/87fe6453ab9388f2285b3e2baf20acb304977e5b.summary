@entity0 -- president @entity2 unveiled his administration 's plan thursday for a leaner , cheaper military , a reflection of @entity0 's fiscal belt - tightening and slower national economic growth			1
the president insisted the new strategy -- which eliminates the military 's ability to actively fight two major wars at once -- will allow @entity15 armed forces to effectively combat terrorism while confronting any new threats from countries like @entity19 and @entity20			1
" over the next 10 years , the growth in the defense budget will slow , but the fact of the matter is this : it will still grow , because we have global responsibilities that demand our leadership , " @entity2 announced during a rare presidential visit to the @entity26			1
" i firmly believe , and i think the @entity15 people understand , that we can keep our military strong -- and our nation secure -- with a defense budget that continues to be larger than roughly the next 10 countries combined			1
" security clearance : does a smaller military make sense ? alluding to the end of the @entity15 military role in @entity40 and plans to eventually withdraw from @entity41 , @entity2 declared that " the tide of war is receding			1
" " the question that this strategy answers is what kind of military will we need after the long wars of the last decade are over , " the president told reporters			1
" yes , our military will be leaner , but the world must know : the @entity15 is going to maintain our military superiority with armed forces that are agile , flexible and ready for the full range of contingencies and threats			1
" the president was flanked by an array of top @entity26 brass during his remarks , including defense secretary @entity64 and @entity66 chairman gen. @entity65			1
republicans immediately blasted the plan , characterizing it as a retreat from the reality of @entity15 's global responsibilities			1
the blueprint is " a lead - from - behind strategy for a left - behind @entity15 , " said rep. @entity75 of @entity76 , @entity77 chairman of the @entity78			1
" the president has packaged our retreat from the world in the guise of a new strategy to mask his divestment of our military and national defense			1
this strategy ensures @entity15 decline in exchange for more failed domestic programs			1
" @entity75 said that " in order to justify massive cuts to our military , ( @entity2 ) has revoked the guarantee that @entity15 will support our allies , defend our interests and defy our opponents			1
the president must understand that the world has always had , and will always have , a leader			2
as @entity15 steps back , someone else will step forward			2
" among other things , @entity2 's strategy singles out @entity19 and @entity20 , pledging to keep strategically critical sea lanes open and successfully combat missile , electronic , cyber and other threats			1
" states such as @entity19 and @entity20 will continue to pursue asymmetric means to counter our power projections capabilities , while the proliferation of sophisticated weapons and technology will extend to non-state actors as well , " an administration document outlining the changes said			2
thursday 's announcement follows multiple missile tests by @entity20 in recent days and comments by @entity20 leaders that they could choke off the @entity122 , a major transit point for world oil supplies			0
the new strategy is the result of months of study at the @entity26			1
it reflects a high - stakes , high - wire balancing act by the president as he faces a more austere budget climate combined with continued high @entity15 responsibilities at home and overseas			2
" the balance between available resources and our security needs has never been more delicate , " the administration document said			0
in a signed introduction to the document , @entity2 called this a time of transition , noting the successful raid on @entity146 's compound and the death of the @entity149 leader , as well as the end to the war in @entity40 and progress in @entity41			2
" the fiscal choices we face are difficult ones , but there should be no doubt , here in the @entity15 or around the world -- we will keep our @entity160 the best - trained , best - led , best equipped fighting force in history , " @entity2 wrote			1
titled " sustaining @entity15 global leadership : priorities for @entity171 , " the document provides the bare bones of a defense strategy that will become more detailed as the @entity167 and @entity168 prepare the 2013 budget			1
in a signal of how carefully the administration had orchestrated this announcement , amid fiscal austerity and during a presidential campaign year , the nation 's highest - ranking military man also threw his weight behind the reforms			2
" it is a sound strategy , " @entity65 said in prepared remarks			2
" it ensures we remain the pre-eminent military in the world			2
it preserves the talent of the all - volunteer force			0
it takes into account the lessons of the last 10 years of war			0
" @entity65 referred to the political uproar over the change from a two - war policy			0
@entity1 users debate the strategy shift " our strategy has always been about our ability to respond to global contingencies wherever and whenever they happen			0
this does not change , " @entity65 said			0
" we can and will always be able to do more than one thing at a time			0
more importantly , wherever we are confronted and in whatever sequence , we will win			0
" @entity65 also said that " the two - war paradigm has been a bit of an anchor , frankly , in trying to help us figure out the future			0
" " it 's not about whether we will fight adversaries as they confront us			0
it 's how , " he said			0
he stressed that he was pleased with the outcome of the strategy review			2
" it 's not perfect , " @entity65 said , but added , " it gives us what we need , in this world and within this budget			0
" @entity64 also weighed in , noting in prepared remarks " the continuing threat of violent extremism , proliferation of lethal weapons and materials , the destabilizing behavior of @entity20 and @entity228 , the rise of new powers across @entity231 and the dramatic changes in the @entity233			2
" " the @entity15 joint force will be smaller and leaner , but its great strength will be that it is more agile , flexible , ready to deploy , innovative and technologically advanced , " @entity64 said			1
the secretary said that while the @entity15 will maintain its obligations in @entity239 , the @entity15 military force posture there will continue " to adapt and evolve			1
" security clearance : parts of defense budget would actually rise @entity64 joined @entity65 in taking on conservative critics who have blasted the administration 's apparent step back from an active two - war strategy			1
" make no mistake -- we will have the capability to confront and defeat more than one adversary at a time , " he said			0
deputy defense secretary @entity253 later told reporters that one way the new strategy could accommodate looming manpower cuts would be through an avoidance of long and large stability operations , an apparent reference to what happened after the initial invasions of @entity40 and @entity41			1
@entity253 refused to offer specifics about the defense cuts , promising new details after @entity2 's @entity266 address this month and the release of additional budget documents			1
asked about the future of one of the country 's most expensive weapons systems -- the f - 35 joint fighter -- @entity253 said , " it is our fifth generation fighter			0
we need it and we want it to succeed			0
" the document released thursday noted the high cost of a decade of wars , with more than 46,000 men and women wounded and more than 6,200 members of the armed forces killed			0
in another recognition of hard economic times , the strategy includes a promise to help veterans find work in the civilian economy			0
as the @entity26 " reduces the size of the force , we will do so in a way that respects these sacrifices , " the administration document noted			2
" this means , among other things , taking concrete steps to facilitate the transition to those who will leave the service			0
these include supporting programs to help veterans translate their military skills for the civilian workforce and aid their search for jobs			0
" defense contractors and civilian workers also will feel the impact of thursday 's announcement and how it ripples through the system of defense contracts in coming years			0
@entity317 has announced it will close a plant that produces b - 52s and 767 tankers and employs more than 2,160 workers in @entity322 , @entity323			0
" the decision to close our @entity322 facility was difficult but ultimately was based on a thorough study of the current and future market environment and our ability to remain competitive while meeting our customers ' needs with the best and most affordable solutions , " @entity324 , @entity317 vice president , said in a news release			0
@entity64 , meanwhile , met with @entity336 defense secretary @entity335 in the latter 's first official visit to @entity0			1
" they spent a good part of their meeting discussing innovative approaches to defense in an era of fiscal austerity , and agreed that @entity348 must continue to invest in military capabilities despite the imperative to achieve fiscal discipline , " @entity26 press secretary @entity339 said			1
the two also discussed @entity41 , @entity351 and @entity20			0
finally , they signed a statement that will provide the basis for the @entity15 assisting the @entity355 in the development of its next generation of aircraft carriers , @entity339 said			2
@entity1 's @entity359 and @entity360 contributed to this report .			0
