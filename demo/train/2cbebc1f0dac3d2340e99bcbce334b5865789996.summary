@entity1 , @entity0 -- the floodlights , corporate boxes and big screens at sports stadiums are all massive power sappers - but there 's an increasingly popular technology which is chewing more energy than ever before			2
power - sapping technology : lighting rigs , like these ones installed at @entity14 are used to help grass growth			1
the culprits are giant lighting rigs			2
the rigs are being adopted by football stadiums across @entity20 and the @entity21 to encourage grass growth , but they 're creating a significant footprint in doing so			1
so , who 's using the most power ? @entity27 football superpower @entity26 could have one of the worst carbon footprints in the region as its home ground is believed to use the biggest set of lighting rigs in the @entity21			1
the club has been accused by environmental groups of using enough energy to power a small village in order to grow the grass on their home pitch			2
the team 's @entity44 @entity43 , which opened in 2006 , boasts a set of 12 lighting rigs with huge sunlamps that run most of the year providing sufficient light to keep the turf growing and in a healthy condition			1
the rigs , which have more than 600 light bulbs , have come under heavy criticism from environmental groups , who say they are " irresponsible			0
" what do you think of grass lighting rigs ? do you think they are useful or a waste of energy ? share your thoughts in the @entity64 box below -- we 'll publish the best			1
purchased for more than $ 1,400,000 from @entity69 - based business @entity67 , the rigs can cover almost half of @entity26 's home ground at a time			1
the lamps contain sensors on the pitch to determine how many hours of light the grass needs in order to stay green			0
similar lights are used at seventeen other venues around the @entity21			2
@entity82 's @entity81 ground has 10 lighting rigs , and @entity85 's @entity84 uses nine			1
in comparison , @entity86 uses four , while @entity88 use just three rigs , at @entity90 -- but there are plans to expand this			0
it 's not just in the @entity21 these lighting rigs are proving popular			1
the @entity14 in @entity96 , @entity97 , earlier this year purchased 15 lighting rigs to improve grass growth at the venue			1
other projects have been implemented across football grounds in @entity103 , @entity104 , the @entity69 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			1
another major power sapping technology at @entity43 is the air ventilation system below the turf , which is powered by a huge fan that helps keep the grass in ideal condition			2
the system 's pipe - work is in the gravel bed below the turf , and above a heating system			0
the ventilation can work in two directions			0
in one direction , it provides aeration through the gravel bed and through the root zone to promote growth			0
reversing the air system can provide drainage from the root zone down to pull moisture away from the surface			0
but , there is hope these stadiums can reduce their energy consumption			0
while football stadiums in @entity20 and the @entity21 are making environmental blacklists -- one stadium in the @entity138 has entered the " green list			1
" the @entity143 ' new baseball park that opened earlier this year became the first @entity144 ( @entity144 ) certified stadium in the @entity138			0
in order to earn the certification , the park was fitted with energy - saving light fixtures , water - conserving plumbing , drought - resistant plants , and a green roof over the concessions area			0
it also has systems in place to keep storm water runoff from polluting a nearby river , and it was built on a restored brown field that once had contaminated soil			0
the @entity162 's @entity161 told @entity163 , " one of the things that really strikes me about stadium facilities is that they directly touch millions of people over the course of their existence , " @entity171 felt the eco-friendly design would encourage visitors to help the environment in other ways .			0

football stadiums across @entity20 and the @entity21 are using lighting rigs to grow grass
@entity26 's @entity43 is believed to have twelve lighting rigs
the rigs have been used in @entity103 , @entity105 , @entity104 , @entity108 , @entity107 and @entity97
