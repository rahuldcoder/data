@entity0 , @entity1 -- two weeks after @entity3 plugged its damaged oil well in the @entity5 with cement and mud from above , the next step in the process to permanently shut down the apparatus is in limbo as scientists gauge the risks posed by pressure inside the well			1
" our first goal is to do no harm , " @entity15 , the government 's point man in the @entity5 , said in a teleconference wednesday			1
the procedure the first week of august was called a " static kill			2
" the timeline for the next step -- the " bottom kill " -- is unknown , as scientists try to determine which of two methods would work best to mitigate the pressure issues , @entity15 said			1
crews could remove the capping stack that sealed the oil in the well on july 15 , then replace the well 's blowout preventer with a new one stored on the nearby @entity34 in the @entity5			1
the other option would require @entity3 to devise a pressure - relief device for the current capping stack			1
once crews get their marching orders , it will take them about four days to prepare , drill the final 50 feet of a relief well and intercept the main well			2
then , the " bottom kill " process of plugging the well from below will begin			1
@entity15 said wednesday cementing will require another several days			1
@entity15 also told reporters that seafood coming from reopened @entity5 fishing waters is safe to eat			1
" there 's no problem with @entity5 seafood			1
it 's being tested more than any other seafood out there right now , " @entity15 said			1
@entity56 chief @entity55 echoed @entity15 's comments about @entity5 seafood , saying that where water may still be tainted , no fishing is allowed			1
" twenty - two percent of federal waters in the @entity5 remain closed because we have not yet determined it 's safe " to eat seafood from there , @entity55 said in the same teleconference			1
she added that scientists are continuing to conduct testing in the areas that have reopened			0
wednesday is the last day that @entity3 will accept claims from people and businesses affected by the @entity5 oil disaster			1
after that , the oil giant will direct people to the @entity76 , led by attorney @entity77			2
@entity77 is charged with independently administering the $ 20 billion escrow account established by @entity3 to compensate for damage caused by the @entity5 disaster			1
at a town hall meeting in @entity83 , @entity84 , wednesday morning , one woman accused @entity77 of working for @entity3 , accidentally referring to him as " mr. @entity3			0
" " this facility is going to be much more generous , much more efficient , and much quicker than @entity3 , " @entity77 responded			0
" if anyone here thinks i am not independent and am merely an arm of @entity3 , do n't participate			0
it 's a voluntary program			2
" @entity77 promised that eligible individuals who submit a claim would get a check in 48 hours and eligible business claims would be paid in no more than seven days			0
but he acknowledged that he 'd have to earn the trust of fishermen and others who say they 've received conflicting information about the oil spill response from @entity3 and various government agencies			1
" there is only one way that i will earn your trust , " @entity77 said wednesday , " and that is paying the claims			1
" others at the town complained that income they 've received from @entity3 for helping respond to the spill would be deducted from their payments , pointing out that those who stayed home would be eligible for more money			0
" there are very few people that i 've met here in the gulf that are in emergency situations , desperate to pay their mortgages and put food on their tables that have not sought other work , other employment , " @entity77 told @entity2 's @entity114 wednesday in response to such grievances			0
@entity3 , which said tuesday it has paid $ 368 million in claims so far , will continue to handle claims by government entities			2
on tuesday , a major environmental watchdog group called for more stringent testing of seafood from the @entity5 , where the fall shrimping season began this week			1
the state of @entity136 just reopened its coastal waters to fishing and shrimping on monday			0
the @entity140 released a statement saying it sent letters to the @entity143 and the @entity56 , co-signed by almost two dozen @entity145 groups			2
the letters asked the government agencies to : -- ensure that there is comprehensive monitoring of seafood contamination			2
-- ensure public disclosure of all seafood monitoring data and methods			0
-- ensure that fishery reopening criteria protect the most vulnerable populations , including children , pregnant women and subsistence fishing communities			0
" with the opening of shrimping season and near - daily reopening of fishing areas , seafood safety is a major issue right now , " dr. @entity160 , a senior scientist with the @entity140 , said in the statement			0
" the government needs to show it is putting strong safety criteria and testing standards in place to ensure that the seafood from the @entity5 will be safe to eat in the months and years to come			1
" the oil spill has hampered the seafood business across the @entity5 as federal and state authorities put much of its waters off - limits amid safety concerns			1
with the once - gushing well capped temporarily for more than a month now , @entity56 and the @entity145 have started lifting those restrictions			2
@entity180 , president of the @entity181 , told @entity2 affiliate @entity182 that although the waters are open and the shrimp have been deemed safe , that does n't mean seafood buyers want it			2
" we 've had major distributors call up some of our processors who have been working with them for years , generations , and they 've basically said , ' we do n't want @entity5 product , ' " @entity180 said			2
" some of those boats have their hulls full of shrimp and no one that 's eagerly looking to buy them			0
" while some shrimpers are eager to get back out , many are still working for @entity3 , which has hired boats to skim oil off the surface and lay protective booms along the shorelines			0
but the need for skimmers appears to be winding down			0
the state of @entity84 said tuesday that of 343 operational skimmers , only 40 were sent out monday in search of oil -- and they came back to shore with 100 cubic yards of debris , but not even one gallon of oil			0
two reports published tuesday express concern about the lingering effects of oil spilled from the ruptured @entity3 well			0
researchers at the @entity220 have concluded that oil from the @entity223 spill may have settled to the bottom of the @entity5 farther east than previously suspected -- and at levels toxic to marine life			1
" the dispersant is moving the oil down out of the surface and into the deeper waters , where it can affect phytoplankton and other marine life , " said @entity227 , a marine microbiologist at the @entity220			0
in addition , a team from @entity237 and the @entity238 released a report that estimates that 70 to 79 percent of the oil that gushed from the well " has not been recovered and remains a threat to the ecosystem , " the university said in a release			0
the @entity238 study " strongly contradicts " a 2 - week - old government report saying that only 26 percent of the oil spilled from the well remains in the @entity5			1
@entity55 addressed the discrepancy wednesday , saying the @entity238 study was based on different parameters than the federal study and , " we stand by the numbers we released in the oil budget			1
" " we have said all along there is dispersed oil subsurface -- that oil is out there , " she said			0
" it is dilute , in parts per million " but " dilute and dispersed does not mean benign			0
" the @entity56 chief said scientists will " continue to do additional monitoring and refine the estimate " as new information comes to light			2
the government believes the water is clean enough for at least one form of sea life to abide			0
@entity15 , @entity55 and some biologists reintroduced 23 sea turtles to the @entity5 off @entity0 , @entity1 , wednesday morning			1
the @entity274 's ridley sea turtles had been cleaned and de-oiled at the @entity275 in @entity276 , and at @entity277 in @entity278 , @entity1			0
then , they were temporarily housed at @entity279 , @entity280 , and the @entity281 , @entity56 said in a press release wednesday			2
to date , approximately 500 live turtles have been rescued during the @entity284 , and more than 450 stranded or captured turtles have had visible evidence of external oil			0
approximately 350 turtles are still in rehabilitation facilities and will be released as they are given clean bills of health , according to @entity56			2
the spill began after an april 20 explosion on the offshore drilling platform @entity223 that killed 11 men			0
two days later , the platform sank and oil started gushing into the @entity5			1
@entity2 's @entity298 contributed to this report			0

new : government 's claims administrator to @entity5 residents : " i will earn your trust "
@entity56 head @entity55 *explains* difference between statistics on oil still in @entity5
the relief well and bottom kill are on hold until pressure risks are *evaluated* and mitigated
