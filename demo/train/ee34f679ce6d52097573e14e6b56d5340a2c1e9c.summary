-- not long before he took office , president @entity1 said something i am sure he now regrets			1
" there are a lot of people who seem to think they know how to run this country			2
i hope they 'll let me hear from them			2
" at least i think i remember him saying something like that			2
anyway , it was a huge mistake , because i have now written 600 letters to the @entity16			1
one every day since he was inaugurated			2
it started as a joke			1
i thought the idea of sending armchair advice to the @entity22 was funny and my first letter was really little more than congratulations			1
read the first letter but after i posted letters on the " @entity30 " blog for 10 days , a lot of readers liked them , so i extended the string to the first month			1
then the first 100 days			2
and now , i have written enough to fill two books			2
and yes , i am aware that this can look like either dedication or mental illness , depending on your point of view			2
most of the letters are funny , or at least they make me laugh			1
like the one i wrote about his fancy new presidential limo			2
mr. president , how 's the 6,000 - pound beast ? but plenty are serious , too			1
i 've written about swine flu , @entity46 , the @entity47 , the wars and of course the economy			2
i 've taken the president to task now and then ; for example , when he wrote to the big guy in @entity54 instead of me , his dedicated pen pal			2
wait a minute , mr. @entity56 i 've written about my own personal struggles and triumphs , such as being trapped in @entity59 , @entity60 , by a blizzard while my beloved @entity62 played the @entity63 in the @entity64			2
trapped in @entity60 sometimes i depart from my regular fare to share events in my life that have shaped my views , like a long story about when i first encountered racism as a child			0
when i discovered racism grinding out so many full - length letters has not always been easy , especially in our increasingly shorthand , e-mailing , texting world ; @entity77			1
after all , i do have a day job			0
many nights , long after the @entity80 newsmakers are asleep and my family is , too , i sit in the darkness of our living room typing away while the dog snoozes at my feet			0
happens on the road in hotels , too			0
i mean , without the dog , of course			0
i considered actually mailing the letters at the start , but decided that if i had to keep up with stamps , envelopes and figuring out how to print on the road i 'd give up			1
plus , he 's a very hi - tech president , so online posting seems adequate			1
although who knows ? despite regular invitations for him to call , write back or come by to play air hockey , he 's never responded			1
but plenty of readers have			0
some have been complimentary , like @entity103			0
" you know every time i get my mind set on something you guys come along and make me re-think things			0
" or @entity115 " your letter is by far one of the most thought - provoking and powerful letters i have read in a long time			1
" or @entity117 , " amen , mr. @entity116			1
" it always makes me vaguely uncomfortable when someone calls me mr. @entity116 , btw			1
at least , i prefer @entity121 to what some obviously want to call me			0
" are you crazy ? " or @entity126 when she finally found something she agreed with , presumably after a lot of reading			0
" @entity0 should find a better job for you			1
that is the first letter you wrote that makes sense			0
" that made me laugh , because i 've felt that way about other writers sometimes			0
many readers have urged me to keep on , and others have begged me to stop			0
i have probably been most touched by people who simply express a heartfelt connection over the miles , like when i wrote about @entity144 's death and @entity145 responded , " thank you for such a nice letter , i feel the same way			1
" and i 'm flattered when someone reposts a favorite , such as the letter i wrote about rebuilding @entity151			0
where is the safe house ? i made a few simple rules for myself			0
first , i do n't pick sides			0
i can offer analysis , ideas and general observations , but not conclusions beyond the common sense kind			0
second , i try to be encouraging			0
third , i respect the presidency			0
although i write in a familiar tone , i never refer to president @entity1 ( nor would i refer to any president ) as " my friend , " or " pal			1
" " how long are you going to do this ? " that 's the question so many people ask , and the honest answer is , " i do n't know			1
" every time i reach a milestone like this one , i think i should call it quits			1
but i enjoy the process , heaven knows i need the practice writing and i do n't want to disappoint the people who now count on these letters every day , including my mother			1
i have considered doing it for the rest of my life			0
i know it 's not exactly the @entity188 journals , but such letters , written concurrently with the events of our world , are an unusual historic record if nothing else			1
i will almost certainly continue through the next presidential election in 2012			0
and i 'd hate to abandon the current president during the critical changeover from first term to second should he win , and if the @entity16 passes into other hands ... well , why should the next president get a break ?			0

@entity0 's @entity116 started letters to @entity1 with inauguration
now he 's reached the milestone of 600 letters ; read them here
some have been funny , others serious , but he 's never gotten an @entity1 response
