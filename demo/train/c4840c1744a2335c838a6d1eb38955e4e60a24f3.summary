-- in the world of cyber security there are some well - known designations for anyone that considers him or herself to be a hacker , the term being so broad in scope now			0
one can be a " white - hat " hacker or a " black hat , " the former being someone who uses their programming prowess to protect digital data , and the latter someone who seeks to subvert and steal it for their own malicious reasons			1
fall into the middle and you 're a " grey hat			0
" the recent revelations about the @entity25 in the @entity26 have made these labels much fuzzier , since government and @entity25 hackers should be white hat			2
yet a recent report in the @entity34 , citing top - secret documents and an internal audit , showed the @entity25 had broken privacy rules thousands of times as it conducted its widespread surveillance			2
of course , navigating the ethics of data privacy is a complicated business since there 's just so much of it -- 90 % of the world 's data has been generated in the last two years , according to @entity46			1
a very likely consequence of the @entity25 revelations from former cyber security contractor @entity49 , is that people will increasingly not care who the hacker trawling through their data is -- whether it 's an ethically - conflicted government contractor like @entity49 , or someone more unscrupulous trying to sell their digital address book to spammers			1
they just want their data to be un-hackable			2

the subversive digital community @entity70 showed this in 2011 , when clusters of young people within its network were able to temporarily paralyze websites of major corporations and steal data , often without the background of real programming knowledge			1
in more than one case these volunteers used a free program they downloaded from the @entity84 , which automated a data theft for them			2
for those in the cyber security industry , such big attacks were an " i told you so " moment , proving how insecure our personal data was when it was stored in online databases by even large companies and institutions			2

smartphones are essentially mini computers and as a result can offer both our best hope for private digital communication , and greater vulnerability			0
it 's been made clear in the last few months that email is no longer considered a safe and secure way to send information to someone			2
the founder of secure email service @entity122 , who counted @entity49 as a user , recently suspended his business in the face of a government investigation			0
the vendors of another secure email service , called @entity130 , shut down their email service soon after , and cited fundamental security flaws inherent in email			0
@entity134 , the co-founder of @entity130 and inventor of a popular encryption standard for email called @entity138 ( @entity138 ) even said at the time that email was just not secure anymore			0
in one way , thanks to using standard internet protocols , it never has been			0
now instead of using email , @entity134 increasingly uses mobile messaging services of the kind offered by his company			1
the general public can take a leaf out of @entity134 's book			0
mobile messaging apps like @entity152 and @entity153 look better mainstream options for secure digital communication			2
researchers : we can hack an iphone through the charger @entity152 avoids advertisers like the plague and relies on subscription payments , while @entity153 encrypts messages and deletes them after a set amount of time -- like a burning candle wick			0
on the other hand , mobile phones are just another attack vector for grey and black hat hackers , with potentially richer information than what 's obtainable from a desktop computer : location data , access to your contacts address book , photos and real time audio through your microphone			1
smartphones are particularly vulnerable in emerging markets like @entity184 , where more people use @entity187 phones than in the @entity26 and @entity188 , and download apps from third party sites because @entity191 is banned by @entity192			1
the problem here is that it 's becoming easier to inject malware into fake apps , for unsuspecting @entity187 users to download			0
in the last few months , security researchers have found a remote access tool in the wild called @entity201 , which coupled with a new software tool called a binder , makes it surprisingly easy to inject malicious code into a fake version of a popular , paid - for app or game , package it together and upload it to a third - party site at a discounted rate or for free			0
once the app has been downloaded , the hacker can remotely steal the victim 's contacts data , turn on their camera or turn on their mic and record conversations			0
researchers say the tool is most attractive to spammers who want to steal contact data and premium text messages			1

far more tame , but still disturbing for many privacy advocates , is the amount of data that mobile app developers are able to funnel out to advertising networks after you 've downloaded one of their free apps -- and this applies to anyone that uses an @entity158 or @entity187 phone in the developed world			1
so long as we continue to rely on small , rectangular slabs for computers and carry them everywhere , pumping them with all manner of personal and professional information , they 'll increasingly become a target for hackers white , grey or black			1
if people value their privacy , they 'll vote with their wallets and invest in services that encrypt their data and keep their communications private -- and a few they might ditch their phones altogether			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity271 .			1

mobile devices are the next battleground for data and privacy , @entity271 writes
pumping phones with information makes them increasingly attractive target for hackers
if people value their privacy , they 'll invest in services that encrypt their data
