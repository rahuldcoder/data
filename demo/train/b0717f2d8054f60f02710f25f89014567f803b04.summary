-- a number of @entity4 employees across @entity5 were fired after an immigration audit targeted the restaurant chain for allegedly hiring undocumented workers , officials said			1
" we are not disclosing a number of people displaced by this , " company spokesman @entity9 said monday			0
" we did lose some restaurant employees in @entity5 following a document review by @entity15			1
" the review took place last month and is likely reflective of a shift away from work - site crackdowns against employees -- considered a hallmark practice under the @entity23 administration -- and toward so - called " i - 9 audits , " which instead focus on the hiring practices of their employers , according to analysts and a @entity31 official who declined to be named			2
the i - 9 form is an employment eligibility document meant to determine a person 's ability to work legally in the @entity36			1
" at the end of the day , the goal is to ensure that the companies have an authorized , legal workforce and also that employers are aware of their responsibility to ensure the people they hire are lawful , " the official said			0
the i - 9 strategy is believed to be a more effective use of the agency 's investigative resources , putting the onus on the audited company to take corrective action , the official added			2
@entity4 has " done what @entity15 has asked of us and are looking to put that incident behind us , " @entity9 said			0
the crackdown coincides with recent judiciary hearings in @entity56 in which lawmakers debated proposals to end birthright citizenship for @entity36 - born children of illegal immigrants			1
nearly one - third of @entity36 's 38 million immigrants are illegal , just under four percent of the total @entity36 population , according to recent reports from the @entity65 and the @entity66 , a @entity67 - based think tank			1
of those , many are employed in low - wage restaurants jobs			0
but analysts debate the broader economic impact of illegal immigration in the @entity36			1
critics often blame the large undocumented workforce for siphoning public resources while forcing a drop in wages or displacing low - skilled @entity36 - born workers			2
advocates say consumers benefit from lower prices as a result of the lower wages paid to illegal workers , arguing that they fill unskilled labor gaps and create work opportunities for higher - skilled , higher - paid workers who are often native born			0
illegal immigration " nationally , does n't seem to make a significant difference " to the broader @entity36 economy , said @entity89 , a senior fellow at the @entity66 who studies @entity36 immigration policy			1
" the real impact is at local levels , " @entity89 said , pointing to state and local law enforcement , schools and health care systems that pay for an undocumented workforce that may or may not contribute tax revenue for services rendered			0
but as record unemployment rates affect cities and towns across the country , immigrants -- particularly illegal immigrants -- are being targeted , she said			0
@entity0 's @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 contributed to this report			0
