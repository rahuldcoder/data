@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 wrestled on wednesday with how to handle a small religious group 's effort to erect a granite monument in a @entity1 park , next to an existing @entity9 display , in a free - speech case involving competing faiths , politics and social norms			1
the @entity14 @entity3 hears a case mixing religion , politics and social norms with national implications			0
on one side is @entity21 , a tax - exempt religious organization that believes in mummification , the rites of transference , and " the @entity21 , " which include the principle of @entity27 and the principle of @entity29 , among others			1
opposing them are the elected leaders of @entity0 , @entity1 , who control the small patch of public land in question			1
at issue is whether such donated monuments on public property represent " private " or " government " speech			1
a ruling from the justices clarifying the difference would affect municipalities nationwide , as well as a range of expressive memorials , from 9/11 victim tributes to battlefield markers			0
" the heart of the question is whether the government may discriminate based on content , and that 's a @entity55 question , " said justice @entity50			2
local officials in @entity0 want the discretion to decide the kinds of permanent displays that can be erected in the park , because they would claim ultimate ownership and control			1
@entity21 , a @entity64 - based group , wants to put up a three - foot granite slab on the " @entity21 of @entity21 , " at their expense			1
necessary permits were denied , so @entity21 sued , saying it was being discriminated against			0
a @entity9 monument was placed in the park in 1971 by a private group , the @entity70			1
the justices appeared uneasy with arguments from both sides , posing a range of hypotheticals to explore the free speech limits cities and private groups should enjoy			1
" you have a @entity81 , do we have to have a statue of despotism ? " said chief justice @entity79			0
" or do we have to put up any president who wants to be on @entity86 ? " " suppose they only accept democrats who are sculptors , " for donated artworks , asked justice @entity91 , " and they reject all the @entity93 ? " the @entity95 administration supports the @entity1 town			1
deputy @entity97 told the court that municipal ownership implies control			0
" it chooses to display it , and then it can do whatever it wants with it			0
it can move it , modify it , destroy it , drop it to the bottom of the ocean , sell it on @entity114			0
" but justice @entity115 warned about unfettered government discretion to approve or disapprove a particular message			1
" that is control with a vengeance , " he said			0
" the government says : ok , we 'll take the @entity70 monument			1
we will not on identical terms take the @entity21 monument because we disagree with the message ... why is n't that a @entity55 violation ? " " there is a fundamental difference between opening up a forum , taking acres of a park and saying everybody gets to go in , " said @entity128 , head of the @entity129 , which is representing the city , " and another situation where the government is clearly controlling it not for a subversive reason			1
" " but really , in this case , the debates as to whether the policy justifications are a sham are relevant , " countered a skeptical justice @entity142 , " you just put up those monuments that agree with the message			0
" " is n't this just government endorsement of this memorial ? " asked justice @entity150			2
@entity21 was founded in 1975 by @entity153 , who said alien visitors -- or " advanced living beings " -- visited him one day after work , appearing hairless and blue and revealing to him the @entity21 concepts			0
after spreading the word and launching his legal fight to erect his monuments , @entity160 died earlier this year			0
classified as a tax - exempt church , the roughly several dozen members of @entity21 prefer to call themselves a philosophical group			1
they have no over-arching doctrine or supreme being , but their movement is extensively laid out in pamphlets , on a web site , and in internet radio broadcasts			0
a 27 - foot - tall , 40 - foot - wide copper - shelled pyramid sits on the group 's one - acre site in @entity64			1
scattered about are preserved animals encased in bronze , @entity179 symbols , sofas and candles ; bright murals adorn the walls			0
off to the side is a large stainless - steel fermentation tank , where alcoholic , sacramental " nectars " or " liquid knowledge " are produced for meditation sessions			2
next door is a building where the rite of mummification is performed			0
it is a key aspect of @entity21 , central to the idea , says group leader @entity195 , that " the soul moves forward			2
" using resins and fiberglass , the lengthy , sophisticated procedures are performed on site , on pets and humans			0
also key are seven principles , or aphorisms			0
taking a different path from traditional @entity209 faith , followers believe @entity210 first descended from @entity211 with the aphorisms instead of the @entity9			1
" all we want to do is share what we have with everyone else			0
i mean , it 's not like proselytizing , " said the 53 - year - old menu , who is a piano teacher			2
" not everyone follows the @entity9 , so maybe people are looking for something else , and all we want to do is show them the possibility			2
" the aphorisms are the seven principles of creation according to the group : psychokinesis , correspondence , vibration , opposition , rhythm , cause and effect , and gender			2
@entity0 was founded by @entity236 settlers in 1850			2
with a population of 30,000 , it lies between @entity64 and @entity239 and is a bedroom community for both			0
a centerpiece of the town is @entity244 , where along with an old schoolhouse and wagons , the @entity9 monument sits tucked near a 9/11 memorial placed by a local @entity250 troop			1
" this park is dedicated to the history of the people , the founding of the city , and significant citizens who have lived and contributed to the community , " said mayor @entity251			2
the @entity70 have erected similar monuments in hundreds of other communities since the 1950s			0
@entity251 says that group 's long - standing ties to the community and their continuing charity work were reason enough to allow the @entity9 to be displayed			1
a federal appeals court ruled for @entity21 , concluding parks are a " public forum " to which private groups have access under free speech protections			1
by allowing @entity9 displays for decades , the judges concluded , various cities have historically been treating permanent displays on public property as private speech			1
@entity21 says the alternative would be for cities to simply ban all such displays , including the @entity9			1
although the appeals court dealt strictly with the case as a free speech issue , the justices raised concerns about religious freedom and the constitutional ban on government favoring one religion over another			1
the @entity3 has refused to offer a broad rule on religious monuments , taking a more case - specific approach			2
@entity9 displays in public schools were banned in 1980			1
but the justices in 2005 allowed a 57 - year - old @entity9 granite monument to stay on the @entity300 statehouse grounds , where it stands amid a series of nonreligious symbols			1
a similar display in @entity305 was ordered removed after the high court concluded it violated the separation between church and state			0
unlike @entity1 , those cases involved efforts to remove the monuments			2
then - chief justice @entity314 noted there was " no exact formula " to determine when such a display crosses the constitutional line			0
the high court is now being asked to adopt such a distinction			0
the case is @entity0 v. @entity21 ( 07 - 665 )			0
a ruling is expected by june .			0

religious group wants to place three - foot granite monument in public park
officials in @entity1 town with @entity236 roots have said no to the request
existing monument in same park displays @entity9
@entity336 cites right to government discretion ; group cites free - speech rights
