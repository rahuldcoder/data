@entity0 -- @entity3 leaders signaled to president @entity4 they 're working on a " comprehensive plan " to address the underlying reasons for the surge of immigrant youth from their countries who are entering the @entity12 illegally			1
the presidents of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 met with @entity4 at the @entity17 on friday as @entity0 struggles to find a solution to what many consider a humanitarian crisis			1
the influx this year of tens of thousands of child immigrants , many unaccompanied , has become a partisan flashpoint on the already divisive issue of reforming a @entity12 immigration system that all sides agree is broken			0
@entity4 and presidents @entity27 of @entity16 , @entity28 of @entity15 , and @entity29 of @entity14 issued a statement that reiterated " our commitment to prevent families and children from undertaking this dangerous journey and to work together to promote safe , legal , and orderly migration			1
" they " all agreed that an effective solution requires a comprehensive and joint effort " from those countries , other nations in the region and the @entity12 , they said			0
specifically , the @entity3 presidents " indicated " to @entity4 that they were working on a plan to address the root causes of why people are leaving their countries			1
underlying causes part of that , all at the meeting agreed , must address strategies for reducing crime and promoting greater social and economic opportunity			2
priorities include pursuing criminal enterprises " that are exploiting this uniquely vulnerable population " and the need to discourage use of " smuggling networks " that place immigrants at " high risk of violent crime and sexual abuse			0
" @entity4 and the others also pledged to redouble efforts to counter misinformation about @entity12 deportation policy around young immigrants that some say is fueling the surge , and promised to further efforts to " humanely repatriate migrants , consistent with due process			1
" most ca n't stay @entity4 told the @entity3 leaders that most of the child migrants crossing the border illegally now wo n't be permitted to stay			1
some have been deported already , while most are being allowed to stay temporarily while their immigration status is sorted out			0
also being discussed within the @entity4 administration has been a pilot program that would let the @entity12 assess asylum claims in those countries in order to reduce the number of illegal immigrants			1
but @entity4 sought to play down that option as an answer			2
" there may be some narrow circumstances in which there is humanitarian or refugee status that a family might be eligible for			0
if that 's the case it would be better for them to apply in country rather than take a very dangerous journey all the way up to @entity101 to make those same claims , " @entity4 said			2
but he added that potential applicants would still have to meet the same criteria to qualify			0
" under @entity12 law , we admit a certain number of refugees from all over the world based on some fairly narrow criteria and typically refugee status is not just based on economic need or because a family lives in a bad neighborhood or in poverty it 's typically defined fairly narrowly , " he said			0
the @entity17 previously called the idea premature			2
but spokesman @entity118 said before friday 's meeting that it could be extended to other countries , if successful			0
struggling for a solution the administration and @entity124 have struggled in recent weeks to come to a consensus on how to address the surge that has overwhelmed border and immigration services			1
@entity4 has asked @entity124 for $ 3.7 billion in emergency funds for border efforts , while @entity131 and some democrats in @entity124 are resisting that proposal , and offering alternatives that would spend less and change immigration policy to deport kids faster			1
either way , @entity4 and others are concerned that lawmakers will leave at the end of next week for their august recess without approving a fix			2
@entity17 @entity131 are expected to vote on a scaled - down border bill next week			1
it would provide less than $ 1 billion to address the crisis and would modify a 2008 law to make it easier to deport children from @entity3 who enter the @entity12 illegally			1
currently , kids who enter the country illegally from @entity3 can stay until they receive an immigration hearing			2
that process can take months or years			0
the proposal to alter that law all but ensures the bill will not come to a vote in the @entity157 , where @entity132 are opposed to tagging that change to a funding bill of its own for the border crisis			2
@entity132 worry that accelerating the process will result in many falling through the cracks and being sent back to situations characterized by many as violent situations in their countries			0
guard troops to border the administration also is considering sending @entity172 troops to the border , according to a @entity17 official , just days after @entity101 gov. @entity174 said he would do just that in the @entity177 area			1
immigrants or refugees ? the @entity180 and the @entity181 sent a team this week to assess @entity184 efforts in the @entity177			0
the number of unaccompanied minors seeping through that area has slowed dramatically since last month			0
key questions about @entity174 's border plan @entity1 's @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 contributed to this report .			0
