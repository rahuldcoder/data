-- no one paying attention to the events in @entity3 , @entity4 , since august will be surprised by the grand jury decision last week to not indict officer @entity6			1
but beyond the fact that the racial make - up of a jury significantly impacts the final results , and that police are far too rarely held accountable for shooting men of color in this country , there was something else that made this ruling feel inevitable : the unmitigated failure of government at civic , local , state and yes , even national level			1
sadly , the decision represents everything that is wrong with @entity25 today			0
in high school , you learn that one of the greatest things about @entity25 is how multiple levels of government and society work together to solve problems			1
civil society made up of churches and volunteer groups work with local government , which gets help from the state government , which itself works in concert with and sometimes independent of the federal government			1
but in @entity3 , nothing seemed to be working			1
indeed , the poor local civil society response to @entity3 was one of the reasons why @entity48 's tragic death and the subsequent social unrest occurred			1
in the best - case scenario , community leaders would have banded together following the shooting and developed a long - term political and protest plan to pressure for change			1
but that did n't happen			0
are protests taking place near you ? i attended local meetings where the white community in @entity3 pretended that nothing happened , huge church meetings were held where few african - americans were invited , and the passive / aggressive " @entity67 " campaign acted as a racial dog whistle that everyone could hear			1
meanwhile , despite a documented history of police harassment , the local black community in @entity3 was pretty disorganized as well			1
much of the organizational leadership had to come from outside of @entity3 because the community was so beat down that there was a dearth of strong local voices in the area			1
part of the reason why @entity80 broke into riots and every celebrity from rapper @entity83 to @entity84 descended upon the area was because there was a vacuum of local leadership to funnel anger and vocalize demands			0
and although @entity3 mayor @entity92 obviously did n't realize he 'd end up in the national spotlight when he took office in april , that does n't excuse his weak response as unrest overtook the city			1
justice system unfair to minorities several local mayors that i spoke to from neighboring towns said @entity92 ignored their advice in the aftermath of the shooting			0
and it is unclear why @entity92 failed to demand that the local police promptly release a police report , which is standard procedure in any shooting			0
the county getting involved did n't make things any better , and placing @entity115 in charge of the prosecution , a man who was seen as having strong local connections to police , was bound to leave residents skeptical			0
and local civic groups who reportedly collected over 3,000 new voter registrations after the shooting were allegedly quiet when a report emerged claiming that the @entity124 had dramatically revised down the number of registrations , with the board reportedly saying that it was simply a " mistake			0
" the state level government was no better			2
in fact , gov. @entity131 's administration gave a lesson on how not to govern			0
a short list of his failures ? failing to send trained @entity136 to @entity3 the moment that political unrest was apparent , failing to appoint a special prosecutor for the case when clearly the @entity142 's objectivity had been called into question , and then declaring a state of emergency a week before the grand jury even announced their decision			1
both symbolically and in practical terms , he was a failure all around			0
finally , at the federal level , president @entity150 's spectacular failure in the entire @entity3 saga has been well - documented and debated			1
the fairest conclusion to draw is that he did little or nothing to help the men and women suffering in @entity3 , instead blathering on in two speeches about respectability politics			2
true , @entity150 dispatched attorney general @entity159 to @entity3 as protests unfolded in august , and the fact that the @entity162 is investigating @entity3 is clearly welcome			2
but that is a slow and overall less than satisfying process			0
after all , it 's been two years since @entity166 was killed and the @entity162 has n't produced any indictments there yet			0
there 's no reason to think that the wheels of justice in @entity3 will move any faster			2
on top of this , there is the disturbing fact that the single solution that @entity150 offered , ( which i suggested at the time ) that the @entity180 allowing local police to get military surplus for free , with no supervision , be reviewed by the federal government seems to have died a slow and ignominious death			2
why do i point all of these things out ? complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity3 because whatever you think of the decision not to indict @entity6 for shooting @entity48 , basic government functions such as voter registration , police transparency , review of controversial programs , selecting objective prosecutors and community engagement are basic government functions that should have worked far better in response			1
if any of these entities at any level were functioning properly , the violence in @entity3 could have been largely prevented and the public would have a lot more faith in the grand jury decision that came out today			2
instead , the lack of an indictment is yet another reflection of our broken government			2
it is a sad day for @entity25 when a whole nation -- and in fact the world -- can watch this country eat its own citizens in fire and tear gas			0
and it 's a failure that falls on every single level of society			0
join us on @entity225 / @entity224 .			0
