@entity0 -- the @entity4 @entity3 on tuesday lifted its foreign travel ban on the @entity7 ambassador following @entity9 's recent decision to send two marines back to @entity0 where they face trial over the killing of two fishermen last year , a lawyer said			1
the court barred @entity7 ambassador @entity15 from leaving @entity4 last month because of @entity9 's refusal at the time to return the two marines , who had been allowed to go home temporarily to vote in national elections			1
@entity20 , a lawyer representing the @entity7 side , said the @entity3 had lifted its travel restrictions on @entity15 after the two sailors -- @entity24 and @entity25 -- subsequently arrived back in @entity4			1
@entity9 's initial decision not to return the marines angered @entity4 government officials and @entity3 justices , who noted that the @entity7 ambassador had given assurances to the court that they would come back to @entity4 after the elections			1
the two sides appeared locked in an impasse , with @entity4 prime minister @entity35 saying @entity7 's actions were " not acceptable " and warning of " consequences " for the two countries ' relations			0
but @entity9 backed down , announcing on march 21 that it would send @entity24 and @entity25 back after receiving written assurances from the @entity4 government that the two men 's " fundamental rights " would be protected			2
the two sailors agreed to the decision , it said			0
but the move created some dissent in the ranks of @entity7 prime minister @entity50 's government : foreign minister @entity51 resigned march 26 over the matter			0
@entity7 has argued that the february 2012 shooting involving its marines happened in international waters and was therefore outside of @entity4 jurisdiction			2
@entity24 and @entity25 say they mistook the @entity4 fishermen for pirates			2
on tuesday , the @entity4 supreme court scheduled a hearing for april 16 to seek the @entity4 @entity63 response on plans to set up a special court for trying the two @entity7 men , @entity20 said			0
