a picture of popular @entity2 actress @entity1 climbing up onto a roof to catch a kite from the scene of tv soap opera " @entity7 " recently went viral online in the country			1
but the online image had been doctored and instead of a kite , @entity1 is seen clutching a smartphone and the caption reads : " i finally got a @entity15 signal ! " it is an internet joke based on a catalog of complaints by @entity2 consumers against wireless carrier @entity15 , angry about its patchy coverage			1
in a survey on its @entity26 page in july , @entity22 - based technology review site , @entity23 , asked : " which is the operator with the worst mobile signal ? " @entity15 , the second largest cell phone company in @entity2 , was voted the worst with 2,127 people selecting it			1
the runner up was oi with just 337 votes			0
meanwhile a spoof video of @entity2 comic @entity33 wearing blue make - up and acting as someone having a nightmare trying to cancel a @entity15 subscription , has attracted nearly three million views			1
the @entity39 , whose trademark is blue make - up , has done a series of commercials for @entity15 in @entity2			2
@entity2 mobile network operators have been in the firing line from the @entity2 telecoms watchdog in recent months following consumer complaints about poor service including calls suddenly disconnecting and customers unable to get a signal			1
in july , the telecoms regulator @entity54 banned three mobile operators from selling new cellphone plans in certain states , telecoms market research firm @entity52 reported			1
@entity15 , the @entity2 subsidiary of @entity58 , was barred from 19 states ; @entity60 from five ; and @entity61 ( @entity62 ) from three , according to @entity52			1
the ban was lifted in early august			0
penetration of mobile subscriptions in @entity2 stands at 131 % , with 258 million mobile phone users , out of a population of approximately 200 million , but analysts have criticized operators for not investing in infrastructure while riding the mobile boom			1
according to the @entity74 , 98 % of the population of @entity73 now have a mobile phone signal , with @entity76 and @entity77 in particular seeing an explosive growth in subscriptions			2

meanwhile the favelas , the illegal settlements in @entity2 that spring up on the fringes of urban areas , known as shanty towns , which tend to be crowded , lack basic amenities and sanitation , and have informal market conditions , have experienced their own mobile revolution -- but not always a legitimate one			1
in the same way that they are havens for " gatos " ( illegal connections to legal sources of water and electricity ) , they have become havens for selling and buying stolen handsets as well as special sim cards that allow you to make international calls for free for three months -- known as " diretão			1
" these are especially popular among drug barons who run their drugs empires using them , according to @entity125 in the @entity126 , published in @entity127			1
about 20 % of the population of @entity22 live in favelas , according to the @entity130 and there are more than 6,000 favelas across @entity2 in more than 300 cities			2
however mobile technology has also been a force for good in them			1
@entity2 @entity137 has been running the @entity139 project since 2001			2
it started with 20 favela - based community correspondents in @entity137 and now has more than 300 from across @entity2 who produce text , photos , audios and videos about their lives , news and cultural activities for its online magazine and website , read by favela residents			1

" cell phones are a massive platform of inclusion , " he says			0
" with these new technologies there are more and more people producing culture , news and content			0
" @entity176 , 31 , an arts teacher and correspondent for the site , who lives in @entity179 , @entity22 , explains : " we have to make an extra effort to create positive news as the newspapers always show only bad things about our communities			2
" " we have helped people perceive favelas differently and we have helped favela dwellers identify themselves differently			0
@entity188 had such a pejorative meaning in the 80s and 90s			0
now the residents use their identity to strengthen their sense of belonging , " @entity191 adds			0
@entity139 also trains the residents in how to make films and take photographs on their cell phones			0
a photograph and audiovisual workshop that @entity139 held at the abandoned vandalized movie theater @entity203 in @entity204 in @entity137 even inspired residents to start a campaign to get it reopened , @entity191 says -- and they were recently successful			0

it was created by the non-profit @entity224 ( @entity224 ) and funded by @entity225 , the social arm of the largest @entity2 telecommunications company @entity60 and @entity227			2
the content was generated from local newspapers and partnerships with community groups and businesses			0

@entity239 , another social project , led by @entity241 , runs @entity242 : sms for @entity244 , which sends daily messages about job opportunities , cultural events , sports , courses and free public services to members of poor communities			0
it also runs @entity254 , a program , in which favela residents , known as wiki - reporters , use gps - enabled camera smartphones , with a @entity254 mobile application , to map unregistered streets and add photos and videos of local points of interest such as hospitals , churches and stores , taken on their cell phones			2
these are then uploaded to www.wikimapa.org.br			0

" this is the only project that we have to identify and cast good things within one of the slums already considered as the most dangerous in @entity22 " says @entity287 , 26 , a wiki - reporter and resident of the @entity289 do @entity291 favela			0
" the sense of marginalization after not even finding a reference to where they lived on virtual maps has been replaced by a twinkle in their eyes now that they can spot their streets and schools among many other used services locally available , " says @entity298 , executive director of @entity239			0
" the results are a strengthened sense of identity and increased self - esteem , " she adds .			0
