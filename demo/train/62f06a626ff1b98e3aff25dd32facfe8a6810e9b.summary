@entity0 -- president @entity2 will use tuesday 's @entity4 address to frame the message of his re-election campaign			1
the annual speech to @entity8 will lay out in clear terms a theme he 's been repeating recently about economic inequality and a government that should ensure " a fair shake " for all			0
@entity16 sources briefed on the draft speech say it will describe a " blueprint for an economy that 's built to last			2
" that blueprint will focus on manufacturing , energy , education and middle - class values , according to a video released on the @entity2 's campaign website and @entity16 sources who have been briefed on the address			1
a @entity16 source briefed on the latest draft of the speech said @entity2 will include a series of proposals , including : -- tax reform so that wealthy @entity35 pay more and the @entity37 tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 expire -- more refinancing for homeowners in trouble -- additional tax breaks for companies that bring back jobs to the @entity35 -- more clean energy incentives -- enhanced education and job - training initiatives , especially for high school graduates seeking technical degrees -- establishment of the so - called " @entity49 " that would set a minimum tax rate for people earning more than $ 1 million			1
the president has proposed such steps previously as part of his administration 's efforts to spur the nation 's still sluggish recovery from the recession			2
given the treacherous state of the economy , the president 's campaign aides are attempting to make the theme of the upcoming election a choice about the role of government and the future of the middle class -- not a referendum on the president 's handling of the economy			1
they say this speech and its underlying theme -- income inequality -- go a long way to shaping that message			0
the president will continue to challenge @entity8 over the ongoing gridlock that blocked most elements of his jobs bill and embroiled @entity0 in a debt fight last summer			2
one @entity16 official said the president will offer to work with @entity8 if @entity8 agrees to work with him			0
however , this official acknowledged that @entity2 's tone will not differ significantly from the approach he 's taken in recent months when he 's attacked @entity92 in @entity8 for general inaction			1
the speech will build on a theme the president laid out in @entity97 last month -- that in today 's economy , the game has been rigged against the nation 's middle class			2
@entity2 will say he wants to return to the " values " that define @entity35 , where hard work pays off and where responsibility -- not recklessness -- is rewarded			1
in a december 6 address in @entity107 , @entity97 , @entity2 described stark differences between a @entity92 ideology he described as leaving people to fend for themselves and his vision of government that helps provide equal opportunity for all @entity35 regardless of where they begin in life			1
" it 's not a view that we should somehow turn back technology or put up walls around @entity35 , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's not a view that says we should punish profit or success or pretend that government knows how to fix all society 's problems			0
" it 's a view that says in @entity35 , we are greater together -- when everyone engages in fair play , everyone gets a fair shot , everyone does their fair share			0
" @entity16 sources told @entity1 on sunday that the bullet points of @entity2 's blueprint will focus on @entity35 manufacturing , including " insourcing " -- or bringing back jobs from overseas			1
the sources say he 'll argue that during his term , the @entity35 has seen the manufacturing industry grow for the first time in 15 years -- especially in the auto industry that he helped with bailout funds			2
on the topic of energy , the president will stress alternative energy development and energy independence from unfriendly nations			2
he 'll also tout his record of doubling fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks			0
the address will include new proposals to prepare @entity35 workers and students for the jobs of the future			0
@entity2 will also suggest job training for the long - term unemployed and veterans , the sources said			1
he 'll also highlight his record of expanding @entity168 grants for college students			0
throughout his speech , the president will weave in an emphasis on what his administration calls middle - class values , and that this is make - or - break moment for that segment of @entity35 society , likely putting it into stark terms , according to the sources			1
he 'll suggest that the @entity35 has a choice to either become a place where only the wealthy succeed , or it can level the playing field and give everyone an opportunity			0
" they 're big ideas , because we 've got to meet the moment , and this speech is going to be about how we do it , " the president 's preview video released over the weekend said			1
" we can go in two directions , " @entity2 said			0
" one is toward less opportunity and less fairness			0
or we can fight for where i think we need to go -- building an economy that works for everyone			0
" @entity16 sources told @entity1 the draft version of the speech will also propose a task force to monitor and enforce trade rules with @entity202 , tough language on @entity204 and seek to put the president 's foreign policy actions and vision in context			1
the day after the speech , the president will begin a three - day swing to states that are expected to be battlegrounds in the upcoming election			0
@entity1 's @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
