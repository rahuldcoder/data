-- @entity1 came relief for @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5			1
then thoughts turned to redemption			0
the trio have been selected as wildcard picks by @entity12 @entity11 captain @entity10 for the biennial team clash with @entity14 that starts later in september			1
and all three have memories from their previous appearance in golf 's most enduring team contest they are desperate to erase			2
for @entity3 and @entity22 -- both major winners -- it is banishing the demons from the " @entity25 " two years ago			2
the @entity12 was on course for its first @entity11 victory since 2008 , before @entity14 overturned a 10 - 6 deficit on a dramatic final day			1
both @entity22 and @entity3 succumbed in the singles , to @entity29 and @entity30 respectively , and are keen to make amends at @entity32 in @entity33			1
" i 've made no secret of how important this team is to me and how badly i want to go back and win the @entity11 , " @entity3 told a press conference in @entity35 at which @entity10 revealed his selections			1
" i think this is a redemption year for a lot of guys who were on the team in 2012			0
" @entity3 returned three points in @entity45 thanks to a formidable partnership with five - time major champion @entity47			1
the 2011 @entity49 winner has had an up and down year but has recorded top 20 finishes in his last five events			0
" he has the ability to hit the ball a long way and he came up to @entity32 with me before the ( @entity59 ) @entity58 to play a practice round , " @entity10 explained of his decision to pick the 28 - year - old			1
" he teamed up great with @entity47 at @entity61 and the most important thing he brings to it is his unbridled passion			0
" @entity22 , the 2012 @entity64 champion , was 15th on the qualification points list , lower than @entity66 who won the most recent @entity68 event at the @entity69			0
he said it was " the greatest call " he 'd ever received when @entity10 contacted him to tell him the news			2
" it was a week that i will never forget , " he said of 2012			0
" it was one of those weeks where it felt like we were going to win and it was kind of a shock sunday afternoon			0
" i 'll never forget the feeling that i had watching the other team celebrate			0
they were all smiles and having fun , we had our heads down and it was n't a good feeling			0
" two years has gone by very quickly and i remember all my matches like they were yesterday			0
i am eager to get back in the mix and try to get back the @entity11			2
" @entity61 was @entity22 's first @entity11 appearance , and he won two matches and lost two			2
those wins were emphatic -- 5 & 4 -- both alongside two - time masters champion @entity95			0
and it was those big victories that persuaded captain @entity10 to select him			1
" after struggling with a couple of different players , who was going to be the best for the team , i had a revelation this morning , " the 64 - year - old said			2
" i looked at the last time the @entity11 was played and i see @entity5 5 & 4 , @entity5 5 & 4 and i said ' that 's got to be the guy '			1
@entity5 played in 2012 , did very well			2
" he has the ability to go real low but more important in our conversations , i liked his desire to be on the team			0
he showed such a strong desire to be in the team and he has had the performance this year to be one of the picks			1
" @entity10 's final pick -- @entity4 -- is also out for redemption , but for the @entity119 , having missed the last transatlantic tussle			1
the 2010 installment , at @entity122 in @entity123 , saw the outcome go down to @entity4 's singles match with @entity126 , the @entity127 defeating him to seal @entity14 's victory			1
@entity4 was a long way down the points list but has enjoyed a recent surge in form , finishing seventh at the @entity49 before winning the recent @entity135 tournament in the season - ending @entity136			1
" losing lingers , " @entity4 said of his 2010 experience			2
" it 's been four years , but it feels like yesterday			0
i remember walking off the green and everyone was having a big party , and i felt like i was walking by myself for 600 yards to the clubhouse			0
" the guys had a tough time at @entity61 and i had a tough time in 2010 , so we have a lot to play for on this team			0
winning is everything in golf and i could not have won a bigger tournament at the right time			0
" earlier on tuesday , @entity14 captain @entity155 chose @entity156 , @entity29 and @entity157 as his three picks			1
the action begins on september 26 .			1

@entity12 @entity11 captain @entity10 picks his three wildcard choices
@entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 make up 12 - strong @entity12 team
