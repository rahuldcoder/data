@entity0 , @entity1 -- much has been made of @entity4 's interest in " @entity5 , " @entity7 's best - selling book on president @entity8 and his cabinet			1
@entity8 , seen here at @entity10 , spent a great deal of time studying military history and strategy			2
but the president - elect may want to put a new @entity18 book on his nightstand , " tried by @entity15 : @entity8 as commander in chief " ( @entity20 )			1
the work by @entity24 - winning historian @entity23 explores how the @entity26 lawyer and self - taught military strategist managed to successfully prosecute the nation 's bloodiest war			1
like @entity8 , @entity4 enters office without any military experience of his own , yet he becomes commander in chief during a time of not one but two wars			1
what can @entity4 learn from @entity8 's example ? @entity2 put that question to @entity23 , but first we discussed how the 16th president developed into arguably the country 's greatest commander in chief			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			0
@entity2 : @entity8 came into office in 1861 with the @entity46 on the brink of civil war			1
how did he get himself up to speed to make critical military decisions ? @entity23 : we know from [ @entity18 secretary ] @entity54 's diary that @entity8 spent a lot of time reading about military strategy , military theory , military history , to try to bring himself up to speed			1
i think another way in which he did it was to talk to as many people as he could find who knew something about the subject			0
@entity8 , of course , was an experienced trial lawyer			2
he knew how to cross-examine people to bring out information and i think that was another way in which he learned was just to talk to people and ask them questions and follow up those questions with further questions			0
@entity2 : @entity8 very quickly had to make momentous decisions , and often dealt with resistance or incompetence on the part of commanders in the field			2
@entity23 : i think @entity8 was surprised by the degree to which he had to become involved in almost day - to - day strategic decisions and command decisions			1
. the [ military commanders ] to whom he delegated these responsibilities and these powers just did not exercise those powers , did not rise to the demand of the occasion , and so @entity8 had to do it himself			2
@entity8 had no substantial experience prior to the @entity15 in military affairs , yet he found himself almost from day one having to make decisions that had large military implications , decisions that were sometimes based on purely military considerations , but in many cases were also based on political calculations that he had to make as president			2
@entity2 : in the introduction to your book you observe that @entity8 " proved to be a more hands - on commander in chief than any other president			2
" @entity23 : i think @entity8 took a more direct hand in formulating strategy and making command decisions than , say , @entity108 did in @entity113 and even @entity114 did in @entity115 and that , in @entity8 's case , was not necessarily by choice but by default			1
@entity2 : before @entity8 's presidency , the concept of commander in chief was n't clearly defined			2
@entity23 : @entity8 actually created the office of the modern commander in chief			1
the constitution merely says the president " shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the @entity46 and of the militia of the several states when called into federal service			0
it does n't define the powers of the president as commander in chief and there were n't any useful precedents for @entity8 in 1861 , so he had to establish the precedents			2
and what he did was to -- i would n't say usurp some of the powers that had been traditionally exercised by @entity143 in wartime in creating and maintaining an @entity145 and @entity146 , but to assert powers that could really only be exercised by the commander in chief himself			0
... he proclaimed the blockade of the @entity153 coastline , which is really an act of war			0
... he increased the size of the @entity145 and @entity146 without congressional authorization			0
he suspended the writ of habeas corpus and the chief justice of the @entity46 said that only @entity143 could do that			0
but @entity8 said this is logically an emergency function of the commander in chief and he established that precedent , as well			0
@entity2 : what do you think president - elect @entity4 might be able to learn from @entity8 as commander in chief ? @entity23 : @entity168 , the @entity169 prime minister during @entity113 , famously said that " @entity15 is too important to be left to the generals			1
" @entity8 certainly would have agreed with that			0
what @entity168 meant is that every activity involved with fighting a war has political consequences , has consequences far beyond the battlefield , has an impact on the entire society and therefore ca n't really be decided strictly on military criteria			1
and i think that @entity8 certainly learned that and that 's something @entity4 will have to keep in mind			1
i think he probably is well aware of it , that , for example , whatever decisions he makes about withdrawing troops from @entity188 or beefing up troops in @entity190 do n't take place in a social and cultural and political vacuum			0
they all have consequences far beyond the battlefield itself			0
@entity2 : @entity8 used his incredible gifts with language to great advantage during the @entity15			0
can @entity4 learn from that ? @entity23 : @entity8 had the ability to communicate ideas and communicate policy to the average person			1
he could make things clear , even complicated things clear , to the average person , and i think @entity4 has that gift , too			0
@entity2 : do you see temperamental similarities between @entity4 and @entity8 ? some people have noted that			1
@entity23 : i think i do			0
... @entity8 occasionally did lose his temper , but he usually managed to maintain his cool			0
... this kind of temperament -- keeping your cool , keeping your temper , trying to base your decisions on rational thought rather than emotions or temporary explosions of temper -- i think they 're similar in that respect and that was a really important factor in @entity8 's leadership qualities			2
@entity2 : finally , as a historian , does it give you pleasure that @entity4 is apparently a reader of history ? @entity23 : well yes , it 's almost exhilarating to have a president who reads history , knows history and realizes the value of understanding history			1
" pleasure " is the right word .			0

@entity23 's new book : " @entity245 "
historian shows how @entity8 handled war , made much up along the way
@entity23 : fighting war has political consequences , @entity4 should heed that
