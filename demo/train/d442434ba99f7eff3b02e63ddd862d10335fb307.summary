-- @entity1 has a big problem			0
the nuclear engineering professor at the @entity4 needs a rare element to fuel his research into a fusion reactor			1
but the cost of the isotope -- helium - 3 -- is rising faster than a rocket headed to space			2
a few years ago it was $ 1,000 a gram , this year it is $ 7,000 and next year , well , he assumes it will be tens of thousands of dollars			0
there are only about 30 kilograms of @entity18 on @entity19 , @entity1 said			1
most @entity10 comes as a byproduct of tritium , used in nuclear weapons , so the exact figure is secret			1
governments covet @entity10 because it works well in sensors that detect the presence of nuclear material , such as the ones that scan incoming cargo at the nation 's borders and ports			1
" worldwide demand is very high , the supply is fixed and going down , and those of us who are trying using @entity10 for research purposes are paying very high prices , " said @entity1 , who is the director of the @entity33			1
" it 'll basically shut off university activity pretty soon because we wo n't be able to afford it			0
" the @entity1 team 's approach toward creating fusion is unique			2
ninety - nine percent of research is geared toward using deuterium and tritium together			0
but using @entity10 instead of tritium would be much safer and drastically cut the chance of nuclear weapons proliferation			1
if @entity18 fusion works , there would be no radioactive waste			1
a breakthrough would be huge , but the team needs more years and more @entity10			1
the thing is that there are tons of @entity10 -- on the moon			1
about 1 million tons , @entity1 said , adding that we also have a pretty good idea as to where the @entity18 is on the moon			1
we would know precisely how many trillions of dollars of the stuff is there if someone goes back to the moon and establishes a base there			0
" a few years ago we thought we were going back soon but that 's all changed now , " he said			0
@entity74 at a crossroads @entity77 astronaut and geologist @entity76 said the @entity79 is behind in the race to return to the surface of the moon			1
@entity76 , who is the author of " @entity83 , " has come to the conclusion that @entity74 's best days are a part of history and it would be best to start over			0
the space agency is dysfunctional in many ways as a management entity and the past two presidents have lacked a good space policy or the implementation of one , he said			1
@entity74 could watch over our obligations to the @entity96 , he said , but missions to the moon and @entity99 should be handled by another group			0
" it 's probably time to create a new agency ... that would focus almost entirely on deep space , " he said			2
" the agency has just gotten old and most of the experience is retiring			0
" next space age has a business model , astronauts say he foresees private companies leading the way to the moon			2
he thinks the fusion research , rocket building and moon base project can be done for $ 15 - 20 billion over two decades			1
by comparison , another big nuclear fusion project ( on @entity19 ) , the @entity117 , has a â‚¬ 12.8 billion ( $ 18 billion ) budget			1
the big question for investors would be : is it worth it when you compare it to the costs of producing other fuels like electricity from coal ? @entity76 said yes , because the @entity10 on the moon is worth about $ 150 million per 100 kilograms			1
still , capital operating costs , which would be in the billions , will have to come down , he said			0
the concentration of @entity10 is low , so many tons of regolith -- a combination of lunar soil , dust and other material -- would have to be mined to collect @entity10			2
it 's difficult to get investors to put money into any helium - 3 project , @entity76 said			0
" the folks at the @entity4 have gone a long way in the early definition , or let 's say , demonstration , of the physics of helium - 3 fusion , " he said , " but we are a long way and have to go through a ( long ) process " before they approach the break - even point where investors ' interest will be piqued			1
the real challenge is proving you can burn @entity18 at their lab in @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity1 and his small team of scientific staff and graduate students have developed a tabletop 3he - powered reactor that can produce a small amount of electricity			1
they are making progress in producing more energy than when they started more than 25 years ago , but there 's still much work to be done			0
the catch ? more energy is used than is produced			0
as critics often note , the promise of nuclear fusion always seems to be 50 years away			1
@entity1 does n't have an end date , a breakthrough date , in sight			0
" i have no doubt that we 'll be able to do it , " he said			0
" with talented scientists and engineers around the world , if we really concentrated , we could do this			0
" our group , i have all the faith in the world in them , but we 're a small group , and we could be at this for a very long time			0
" not the only reason to go to the moon @entity76 and @entity1 wholeheartedly agree on one thing -- @entity18 is not the only reason to return to the moon			1
as @entity76 said , " we 've only touched the surface of exploring it			0
" the main reason to go back is to learn how to live in space and use the moon as a jumping off place for missions to @entity99 , @entity1 said			2
there are other reasons , they said , including other elements available on the moon and using the lunar surface for telescopes			0
but @entity76 , who has consulted for @entity1 's project since 1985 , and the professor think @entity10 has such potential it makes going back a vital mission			2
after all , it could potentially power the @entity19 for thousands of years			2
" you would go to the moon for long - term clean energy , " @entity1 said , " because this is really an enormous source of energy			0
there is 10 times more energy there than there ever was in fossil fuel on the @entity19			2

@entity10 is in scarce supply on @entity19 , much more *abundant* on the moon
used as a fuel for nuclear fusion , there would be almost no radioactive waste
@entity4 team has built a small reactor to show @entity18 might work as fuel
former @entity239 astronaut thinks @entity79 needs new space policy , agency and moon return is vital
