-- just imagine , for a moment , a world in which @entity2 had never lived			1
how might daily life be different ? computers are still around , but not as you know them			1
they 're complex , hateful things , mostly used in the office for spreadsheets and other business applications			2
nobody bothered to sell a good - looking user interface with a desktop and mouse , because nobody could be sure there was a mass market for it			2
thousands of people use pcs at home , but they 're mostly hobbyists and amateur programmers			2
if you want to have fun with electronics , you hook up a videogame console to your tv			1
the internet still exists , but it never really had as much of a platform to take root on			2
there 's a thriving market in trading @entity33 online , but all of it is illegal			2
the record labels never got their act together on selling digital copies of songs			2
mp3 players are large , clunky things with too many buttons			2
no movie studio makes really good computer - animated films			2
smartphones are bulky bricks with thick keyboards			0
touchscreen tablets exist -- as prototypes in a few computer labs			0
okay , so maybe things would n't have been quite that bad without @entity2			1
perhaps @entity53 's management would have figured out it was sitting on a goldmine in its @entity56 and early - model mouse			0
@entity57 might have come up with @entity58 without the example of the @entity60			0
maybe @entity61 would have found another compadre to help him design , sell and market the @entity64 , the pc that started it all			1
but none of that seems very likely			0
many words have been written attempting to distill the magic of @entity2			1
to my mind , it boils down to this : he saved technology from itself			1
he stopped it from being scary to a mass audience			0
he took the excitement and optimism that @entity80 already felt about computing , and never ceased to find new ways to communicate that to the world			0
for all of his celebration of crazy revolutionaries who liked to " think different , " @entity2 was a champion of the mainstream			1
his business idols , he liked to say , were the @entity89			0
that was n't just because the way their four personalities balanced each other was a good model for management			0
it was also because what they made was accessible -- and enjoyed by everyone on the planet			0
i 've written about my experiences interviewing @entity2 for @entity104 here , but the first time i ever spoke to him was a prime example of his mainstream approach			1
this was shortly after his return to @entity64 , in an interview for a now - defunct supplement called @entity115			1
after a handful questions , @entity2 suddenly lost his temper			1
" i know hundreds of people who read @entity104 , " he fumed			0
" i do n't know anyone who reads @entity115			0
" with that , the interview was over			0
thankfully , we had dozens of pleasant encounters after that			0
but i would always understand that he knew exactly who he was talking to , and that he was always laser - focused on reaching as wide a readership as he could			1
he gave great quotes -- quotes that did n't talk down to the reader , but rather let them peek behind the scenes at @entity64			1
" the dirty little secret of the @entity136 is that there 's no way to make money , " he told me when it launched on the pc			0
" we do it because we 're selling ipods			0
" ipods , iphones , @entity144 -- @entity2 had his product road map worked out way in advance , and it was all about getting supremely easy - to - use products into the hands of as many users as possible			1
compromised , committee - designed devices , such as the ho - hum @entity154 @entity153 phone , only served as examples of what @entity64 should n't make			1
so what now ? is there another visionary in the world with that kind of drive , ambition , focus and zeal ? plenty of pundits have said we 'll never see the likes of @entity2 again -- but i hope they 're wrong , and i think @entity2 would hope that too			1
because who wants to see a world without the mid- 21st century equivalent of the @entity60 , or the @entity175 , or @entity176 ? if someone does pick up that baton and champion mainstream - friendly , fear - free technology , think where we 'll go next			0
