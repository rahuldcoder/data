if beauty is indeed truth , as @entity3 claimed , then this story ought to be true : the logo on the back of your @entity6 or @entity8 is a tribute to @entity10 , the man who laid the foundations for the modern - day computer , pioneered research into artificial intelligence and unlocked @entity16 wartime codes			1
his death , a decade after the end of the war , provides the link with @entity21			2
unrecognized for his work , facing jail for gross indecency and humiliated by estrogen injections intended to ' cure ' his homosexuality , he bit into an apple he had laced with cyanide			0
he died in obscurity on june 7 , 1954 , 10 years and a day after the @entity33 , which made copious use of intelligence gleaned by his methods			0
and so , the story goes , when two @entity41 entrepreneurs were looking for a logo for their brand new computer company , they remembered @entity10 and his contribution to their field			1
they chose an apple -- not a complete apple , but one with a bite taken out of it			0
sadly , the truth is rarely as simple , or beautiful , as we would like			1
i first researched this story in 2005 and was assured by someone at @entity21 that it was indeed true			1
the article struck a chord and several people got in touch to say how pleased or touched they were to hear the story			2
a few years later i mentioned it to another @entity21 employee , who immediately said that he thought it was a myth			2
it may have started around the time of the 2001 film about the @entity69 code breakers , @entity70 , or it may have just resurfaced then			0
he checked with @entity21 headquarters , and although they were non-committal , it was clear that that @entity10 story was not official @entity21 history			1
the apple represented knowledge , as in the biblical story of @entity81 , or referenced the falling fruit that led sir @entity83 to the concept of gravity			0
supporters of the latter theory note the name of @entity21 's handheld pda , the @entity83 , but that was more than a decade after the creation of the logo			1
sadly , the evidence now points in a more prosaic direction			0
in a 2009 interview with @entity96 , @entity97 , the man who drew the logo , reflected on the theories about his work			1
he dismisses sir @entity83 or the @entity103 as source material and , while he says he is charmed by the links with the @entity10 story , he says he was unaware of them at the time			1
" i 'm afraid it did n't have a thing to do with it , " he said			0
" it 's a wonderful urban legend			0
" @entity97 says that he received no specific brief from @entity113 , and although he 's hazy about how he settled on the simple outline of an apple , the reason for the bite is crystal clear : it 's there for scale , he says , so that a small @entity21 logo still looks like an apple and not a cherry			1
it was n't long before @entity97 discovered the first happy coincidence of his design , when a colleague told him that " bytes " were the foundation stones of computing			2
the more romantic myth - making would follow soon behind			0
i was disappointed when the @entity10 story was first cast into doubt , but grew to enjoy the uncertainty			1
@entity136 seemed a fitting , even poetic state , for the tale of a man who lived in the shadows			0
even his tribute was now floating between life and death , like @entity145 after she swallowed her own mythical apple			0
i hope that a similar respect for beauty over cold , hard fact lay behind @entity113 ' silence on the matter			2
he could have dismissed the creation myths inspired by his company , but he chose not to			0
more than most , he appreciated the value of a beautiful story .			1

@entity159 says one story recounts how the @entity21 logo was a tribute to @entity10
" sadly , the truth is rarely as simple , or beautiful , as we would like , " he *writes*
@entity21 logo artist @entity97 is charmed by the story but was unaware of the *association*
@entity171 : more than most , @entity113 appreciated the value of a beautiful story
