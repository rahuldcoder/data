-- the most anticipated new tv series of 2011 really kicked off on sunday as the four " @entity3 " judges -- @entity4 , singer @entity5 , record - label exec @entity6 , and , yes , @entity7 -- gathered to audition wannabe superstars in downtown @entity9			1
before the judges stepped onto the stage of the @entity18 on the campus of the @entity20 , the show 's hosts , former @entity13 @entity12 and @entity15 tv personality @entity14 , introduced themselves to the audience			2
" you 're all probably wondering , who the hell is this douche ? " said the self - deprecating @entity14 , while @entity12 danced around him			2
" @entity14 's actually a great singer , " @entity12 said			2
" you wan na hear him ? " the crowd cheered him on , at which point he offered to croon ... " @entity29 " by the very @entity15 group @entity30			2
( do n't get me wrong , i 'm a huge @entity30 fan , but i think i could have counted on one hand the people there who had any idea of what he was talking about			2
) unfortunately , it was then time for the judges to take the stage , so we did n't get to hear @entity14 ' musical chops			2
" you are going to be our fifth judge , " @entity4 told the crowd			1
" you 're here to tell us who you like , who you do n't like			2
you can certainly be as badly behaved as you want , actually			0
" he then passed the mic to @entity6 , who introduced himself by saying , " to be clear , i 'm not the @entity52 of the panel			1
i do n't say ' dawg , ' but i do judge talent honestly			0
and i may not even agree with what you guys think			0
" he then added with a smile : " i 've had more success at it than you			0
" ( that was a very interesting foreshadowing of a battle @entity6 would soon have with the audience			1
but more on that in a bit			0
) it was then @entity68 's turn			1
" i 'm thrilled that you invited me back , " she said to @entity4			1
" it 's a blessing to be part of this			0
and i could n't be more thrilled to have someone on the panel here also who has experienced what it 's like to sit next to him ... miss @entity5			0
" @entity0 : @entity14 , @entity12 set to co-host ' @entity3 ' the charming @entity78 then made her first statement to the audience : " i 'm going to love getting to know @entity81 , and i hope you like to get to know me too			1
you might have to bear with the accent just a little bit , but i 'm sure you 'll get used to it			0
" from a nuts and bolts standpoint , " @entity91 " looks kind of like " @entity87 , " except with @entity89 cups on the table			1
( @entity4 and @entity68 seemed happy to be reunited : during one break he lovingly petted her hair			1
) but one of the biggest differences was apparent the minute the first contestants hit the stage			1
the first act to audition was a duo ( though not a very good one ) , comprised of two twentysomething male friends			1
@entity6 was fairly tough right off the bat : " it looked like you guys were having a good time , " he said of their rendition of @entity112 's " waterfalls , " " but i 'm not sure you 're cut out for the big time			1
" the talent did n't look too promising from there			0
the first solo singer , a 52 - year - old mom who butchered " @entity128 , " earned so many boos from the audience members ( many of whom started singing " @entity121 " ) that the show 's audience warm - up guy had to say , " we 're going to try and steer away from the negativity " and ask them not to boo the contestants			0
but the real drama surrounded the eighth contestant , a 35 - year - old female rapper / singer			0
after she performed a @entity135 rap original called " @entity136 , " the instant crowd favorite got a no vote from @entity4 and yeses from @entity68 and @entity78 , leaving her fate in @entity6 's hands			1
the mogul voted no , leading to loud boos from the audience			0
after she left the stage , crowd members chanted " bring her back ! " at which point producers had her walk back on the stage			0
the judges told her she had 30 seconds to perform something else			2
her second number was even stronger , and led to an even more enthusiastic response from the crowd ( who were clearly taking @entity4 's " fifth judge " edict seriously )			1
said a defiant @entity6 : " i 'm changing my no vote , not because of them , but because of you			1
" the fact remains , however , that had the crowd not demanded she be given a second chance , she would n't have gotten it			0
( you 'll have to watch the show when it premieres this fall to see if she officially made it through to the next round			0
) in all , @entity68 and @entity78 were certainly the kinder mentors , while it 's looking like it could be a battle between @entity4 and @entity6 for the title of " @entity3 's " harshest judge			1
