editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is broadband television network of @entity5			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- for the launch of @entity5 in @entity21 , we decided to make an entire issue about @entity21 , written entirely by @entity21			1
at the same time , we came up with the idea of producing a parallel version of that issue in video for @entity9 and populate our site with documentaries about @entity21 , local artists , local musicians and beautiful @entity21 girls for the entire month			1
since then , we repeated the same concept when we launched the magazine in @entity33 , and we produced an entire month of content about @entity35 during the @entity36			0
producer @entity37 and i spent a few weeks in @entity39 producing an hour - long documentary about nighttime crime photographers , interviewing some of the best bands and artists in the city and shooting a project about b movies inspired by the lives of drug traffickers			1
a couple of days before @entity49 , i got to spend a few days at an amazing place called @entity51 ( @entity52 ) , a retirement home for older prostitutes in @entity55 , one of the sketchiest neighborhoods in the city			1
i went there with @entity60 , who wrote the print version of the article , and i produced the documentary version of the same story			0
the house has a minimum age requirement of 60 and can accommodate up to 45 women			1
right now , there are only 23 retired ladies of the night living there			0
the majority of them continue working , because there are still people who want to pay to have sex with them			0
see the rest of @entity77 at @entity9 we had the opportunity to meet some of the women that live there , such as 86 - year - old @entity83 , who sang for us and told us stories of her youth , and @entity87 , a childless widow in her 60s who is still turning tricks			1
we met @entity91 , a woman in her 80s who was soft spoken and looked incredibly tired			0
she had stopped working just a few years ago and now sells candies for a living			0
finally , we spent some time with @entity95 , a 61 - year - old who is still a sex worker and hopes to continue working for as many years as she can			2
we ended up spending @entity49 with them at what was perhaps the most bittersweet party i 've attended			1
the women were dancing and eating and drinking punch together , they joked around and seemed to be having a great time			2
but at some point , @entity95 started talking to me about her sons , whom she has n't seen in years and never really visit her			0
she also talked about the kids of many of the other women in the house -- none of them present at this party -- to celebrate motherhood			2
most of these women actually ended up becoming prostitutes to support their children as their only means of survival			2
i think the work that this house and its director @entity122 do -- as weird and unusual as it may seem -- is incredibly valuable			0
spending @entity49 with these brave women forever changed they way l look at prostitution and without a doubt has been one of the most intense parties i 've ever attended .			1
