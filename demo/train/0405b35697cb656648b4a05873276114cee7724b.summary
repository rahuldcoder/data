big , bright and bubbly -- comedian @entity0 never apologizes for who he is			1
between duties as a " @entity9 " correspondent and guest appearances on @entity4 's late - night talk show " @entity5 , " the 33 - year - old covers a lot of ground in the 200 - plus pages of his new memoir " @entity14 " he shares with readers the story of how he came out to his parents and why overcoming personal insecurities , like his high - pitched voice , were key to his success			1
ahead of his memoir 's may 7 release , @entity0 sat down with @entity23 to share a few juicy details and explain why he 's not leaving anything out			1
@entity23 : in your book , you say you always knew you 'd write a memoir			1
you 've been in the business for a little over a decade , so why did you decide to do it now ? @entity0 : as i was working in @entity32 and sort of amassing these stories i thought , ' remember all of this			1
' it just felt like the right time			2
especially with @entity5 's ( @entity39 ) success in the literary world , when she heard i wanted to write a book she said ' i want to publish this			1
' it just felt like the perfect time			2
@entity23 : you divulge more than a few secrets in the book			1
was there anything that you held back or something you thought twice about before printing ? @entity0 : well , you know this book is about me , and the world through my eyes			1
if i did n't tell every story -- the ones where i was a hero and the ones where i was n't a hero -- then there was no point in telling it			2
the only time i ever held back is when it was about someone else			2
i did n't want to throw anybody else under the bus , but i definitely bear everything out about me			2
i mean there 's nothing off limits in the book			1
i mean , i tell every sordid detail of my life -- the pretty and the not - so - pretty			2
@entity23 : you said that you got your start , in part , because of an attribute you were once ashamed of , your voice			2
how has that shaped who you are today ? @entity0 : ( @entity83 ) ok , listen , at a certain point i just had to realize puberty d * cked me over			1
so i just said , ' use it ! shake your moneymaker			2
' my brother used to make fun of me , people in school used to make fun of me and i just realized one day that this is the card you 've been dealt , use it to your advantage			2
and when i did that , everything changed for me			2
@entity23 : a lot of kids and , let 's face it , adults struggle with their insecurities			2
at what point in your life , did you decide you were going to let go ? @entity0 : i do n't know if i can mark the day			1
i remember feeling it happening , though			0
it was when i found really great friends in school			0
suddenly , i had those moments where i forgot to be insecure			0
sometimes i 'd catch myself and be like ' @entity112 , i wish i could be like this all the time			0
' so i just eventually began challenging myself to feel that way			0
and not to be too preachy , but i would really recommend to people , if you get the chance , to trust yourselves to leap without a net , because that will build the confidence			0
you know , you might shock yourself with how much you do n't need a net because you can catch yourself			0
@entity23 : you decided to make the very last chapter of the book about the day you realized you were gay			1
was there a reason behind that ? @entity0 : that was very much on purpose			1
again , i define ' man up ' as you are what you are			0
love yourself , whatever makes you different , and use it to make you stand out			0
mine is my voice and the fact that i 'm gay , well , the fact that i 'm flamboyantly gay			0
but i did n't want the book to only be about that			1
i am a gay man , but it 's not only a gay story			0
whatever people have to ' man up ' about , that 's their own version			0
it can be big ears , skin color , freckles , acne , whatever it is , mine is what it was			0
it 's a universal message			0
you know , everybody , everybody has that thing that makes them question their worth , their importance , and , you know , this book speaks to that in each of us			1
@entity23 : what 's the one thing you hope readers take away from your book ? @entity0 : the most important thing to take away , if you step back , is that all these stories -- celebrity stories , stories about being caught stealing clothes from a women 's store in the mall -- every one of these stories has a common thread which is : i never compromised who i was			1
and when i did , i made sure i never did it again			0
people should never apologize for who they are and they should never hide who they are			0
hating yourself is so 2011			0
@entity23 : if you could interview anyone now , who would it be ? @entity0 : i would like to sit down with @entity187 , just because i 'd like to talk to her			1
i want to sit down and like , converse			0
like , ' honey , let 's chat ! ' actually , just put that in the story			0
i 'm asking if anybody reading this has @entity187 's e-mail or number , just call her or text her about the book ! @entity196 a solid			1
@entity23 : you started one of the last chapters by saying that one person can change the world			1
do you really believe that ? and if so , what 's the one thing you would change ? @entity0 : listen , i know it 's true because i 've lived it , and i 've done it , ok ? i brought butternut squash back			1
there was a restaurant , they took an item off , i fought , they brought it back , and they named it after me , ok ? and i 'm just one person			0
and of course it 's silly to say that it 's changing the world , but it 's just an example			1
it 's the little things you do to say , ' no i 'm not going to stand for that ! i 'm not going to stand for it ! ' those little things add up			0
@entity23 : is there any other societal issue that weighs heavily on your mind ? @entity0 : yes			1
i think if i record a program , we have got to have the technology where i could record something on my dvr and like , e-mail it to a friend			0
i know this is lame , but why have n't they invented that yet ? ! ? !			0
