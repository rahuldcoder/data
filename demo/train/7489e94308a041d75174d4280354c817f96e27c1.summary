-- @entity1 talk a good game about wanting to eat well			0
more than 75 percent claim they want to see more healthy options on restaurant menus			0
but when it comes time to order , only about half say they actually make nutritious choices , according to a recent survey			0
steakhouse portions often exceed the recommended five to seven ounces of animal protein per day			0
on the other hand , 77 percent rank taste as the top priority for a restaurant dinner , and 44 percent say satisfying hunger matters most , according to the responses reported in june by @entity18 , a market research firm			0
of 2,000 adults polled in february , 20 percent said food health is an important factor when they order dinner			1
still , nutrition experts stress that it is possible to satisfy your taste buds and hunger while making nice to your heart			1
" eating out with friends and family is a pleasure you do n't have to give up when you 're on a special diet , " said @entity28 , a registered dietitian and senior editor at @entity30			1
" you just need to arm yourself with information about heart - healthy choices and not be afraid to ask questions about the menu and make special requests			1
" ( @entity30 is owned by @entity42 , the parent company of @entity0			0
) every person 's needs are different when it comes to what he or she should eat , health experts say			0
" there are some people that really have to worry about calories , there are some people that really have to worry about sugar , some people that really have to worry about salt			1
all of these bring in different kinds of mandates for you , " said @entity59 , a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the @entity61			1
still , some foods are more likely than others to derail a heart - healthy diet			1
here are some tips to help you eat for your heart when dining out			2
@entity72 instead of oil - and fat - laden dishes such as lo mein , egg rolls , kung pao chicken or fried rice , try steamed chicken , seafood or tofu with vegetables , and ask for sauce on the side			1
" @entity72 food can be a hidden salt mine , " said @entity84 , a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the @entity86			1
ordering it " as unadorned as possible " and with sauces on the side will help you control your sodium intake			0
soups such as egg - drop and hot - and - sour are low - calorie and low - fat , but may also be " salt bombs , " @entity84 said			1
but despite the poor reputation eggs have for their high - cholesterol properties , low - fat dieters do n't have to steer clear of egg - drop soup , she said : " it 's saturated fat and trans fat in your diet that raise your blood cholesterol , more so than cholesterol in your diet			2
" stir - fried dishes are also a safe bet because they 're generally cooked quickly and with very little oil			2
on the other hand , watch out for foods designated " crispy " or " double - sauteed , " which indicate deep - fried dishes , said @entity84			1
sandwich shop instead of a sandwich on white bread , a white roll or white wrap and topped with mayonnaise or cheese , try whole - grain bread options topped with vegetables , mustard or olive oil , and little to no cheese			1
watch out for deli meats , which often contain a lot of salt , @entity59 said			1
hummus can be a good alternative to mayonnaise or cheese , as it contains heart - healthy fat			1
@entity59 endorses hummus , which is made from chickpeas , because it helps @entity1 fit legumes into their diet			0
just do n't overload on it , because the calories can add up			0
@entity59 also suggests skipping oversized muffins			0
even if they 're bran muffins and consequently high in fiber , they 're full of fat , sugar and calories			0
breakfast wraps can also be detrimental to a heart - healthy diet , especially when an entire salt - and fat - heavy meal of eggs , cheese and bacon is packed into a compact package			1
@entity161 instead of pasta topped or filled with cream , cheese or meat , try grilled , broiled or poached seafood with a small order of pasta with garlic and oil or tomato sauce			0
@entity84 suggests ordering shellfish such as shrimp , mussels or clams at an @entity161 restaurant , as long as they are n't deep - fried or cooked in butter			2
although these shellfish might be higher in cholesterol than salmon or tilapia , she said , they 're still very low in saturated fat			0
if you do want cheese in your meal , add a sprinkling of parmesan atop a dish instead of gobs of cheese as the centerpiece of your meal			0
and for an appetizer , @entity84 recommends skipping the meat - and cheese - heavy antipasto salad in favor of shrimp cocktail , which is low in saturated fat			2
also , pair bread with heart - healthy olive oil , not butter			1
oil is rich in calories , though , so do n't overdo it			0
@entity205 instead of tempura - style rolls or rolls with @entity208 ( think spicy tuna ) , try fresher sushi with fish high in cardio - friendly omega - 3 fatty acids , such as salmon , tuna , mackerel or halibut			1
the avocado in @entity219 rolls also carries heart - healthy benefits			1
@entity222 , which are green soybeans , may indirectly lower your blood cholesterol and are a good source of fiber and omega - 3s , @entity84 said			2
but if you 're monitoring your sodium intake , request that the salt be omitted			2
be on the lookout for the word " kewpie , " or @entity205 mayonnaise , if you 're trying to cut back on saturated fat			1
steakhouses instead of a full portion of steak , try limiting your meat intake by ordering a beef kebab , or a chicken or seafood selection cooked without butter or salt			1
choose lean cuts of beef such as round , sirloin , chuck , flank steak or tenderloin			0
remove any visible fat that may be attached to the cooked meat , @entity252 said			0
the @entity61 recommends eating five to seven ounces of animal protein per day , and a 12 - ounce steak at a restaurant far exceeds that , @entity59 said			2
split a steak with one of your dining partners , or eat half and take the rest home for another meal			0
steakhouses also offer deceptively fattening sides , such as creamed spinach or fully loaded baked potatoes			2
swap out those fatty sides for steamed vegetables , and you 'll be in better shape			0
@entity275 instead of a cheese - filled burrito or taco , try a seafood , chicken or vegetable fajita			2
the seafood or chicken will provide lean , healthy protein , while a vegetable centerpiece will boost your fiber intake			0
if you get beans , make sure they 're not refried ; black beans provide protein and fiber without artery - clogging saturated fat , @entity84 said			2
you can also cut down on saturated fat by opting for @entity295 or salsa instead of sour cream			0
since it 's made from heart - healthy avocados , guacamole contains good fat that can lower bad ldl cholesterol while raising good hdl cholesterol			1
just limit your intake to about two tablespoons , @entity84 said , because it can carry a lot of calories			0
@entity84 also warns that you should watch out for salted rice and rice with cheese -- no - no 's for people on low - sodium or low - fat diets .			1

dietitian : be heart - friendly by asking how things are prepared , making requests
" @entity72 food can be a hidden salt mine , " another dietitian says
at steakhouses , portion size can present a *challenge*
watch out for " kewpie , " or @entity205 mayonnaise , at sushi restaurants
