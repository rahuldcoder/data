@entity0 -- to the outside world the images from @entity4 state television are nearly comical -- weeping soldiers chasing @entity7 into the freezing sea , elderly women screaming as the young leader approaches , and @entity4 unleashing dogs at a poorly made effigy of a @entity14 leader			1
but as @entity17 watches , her eyes begin to brim with tears and her lips tremble uncontrollably with national pride			1
@entity17 is not a @entity4 anymore , having defected to @entity14 11 years ago , abandoning the totalitarian regime			1
in the @entity4 , she experienced starvation , the brutality of the regime and fled with her daughter in hope of a better life in the free world			1
but as @entity17 watches @entity29 , the @entity4 's only television channel its citizens can view , the power of the propaganda she grew up with takes hold			1
" they 're @entity38 , " she says , referring to @entity4 's trinity , @entity7 , his father @entity35 , and grandfather @entity36			1
the tears are now running down @entity17 's perfectly made up face and she chokes back a sob			1
" this is how you are brought up since birth			2
even i can feel the pull in my heart			1
i thought i forgot about this feeling since it has been so long			0
" but seeing this now , i feel i 'm back in @entity4			1
i do n't know how to express myself			0
he is really great and i feel we will all die without him			2
" @entity17 stops talking and asks for a glass of water			2
she tries to compose herself			0
" i know their sincerity , " she says , as she watches a group of soldiers sing and sway before @entity7 , their faces red with emotion and streaked with tears			0
" this is not a lie			0
it is not an act			0
if anything happens , they will give up their lives			0
they will even jump into fire			0
" @entity17 seems to fall into an other - worldly trance , unable to answer questions as clearly as she did before the @entity4 television started to play			1
she watches children 's programs , which always have the evil @entity77 or @entity14 villain that must be defeated			2
prime - time movies are often war movies or romantic tales where the @entity4 defeat the @entity77 imperialists			2
@entity17 laughs as she sees a program she recognizes from her childhood , a clay action movie where an adorable @entity4 cat defeats the evil @entity14 rats			1
watching her slip back into her time as a @entity88 resident is a window into how the @entity4 regime manages to maintain its seemingly unyielding hold on its people			1
" even if i tried to explain this , i do n't think people here would understand			0
they wo n't think this is real , " she says , watching a news clip of adoring citizens waving flowers and rushing to the young leader			0
" but this is true			0
and we ca n't think for ourselves			0
when @entity4 watch news on the dear leader , they believe in it			2
we live because of him			0

@entity17 abandoned @entity4 for the @entity14 11 years ago
she experienced starvation as well as the brutality of the regime
but seeing images from her native land fill her with pride
" this is how you are brought up since birth . even i can feel the pull in my heart "
