-- @entity1 wants to increase its entrance fees , and several other national parks may do the same			1
for the first time in eight years , the @entity4 has given park sites that charge entrance and amenity fees permission to increase their rates by set amounts			1
they have to engage their communities , note what the increases will cover and get approval by park service headquarters			2
fee increase proposals are due by march 15			2
though just 133 of the 401 @entity4 sites across the @entity21 charge an entrance fee , they 're some of the parks that travelers often think of first			1
think @entity25 , @entity26 and of course , the @entity1			1
@entity1 is proposing to increase several fees for the first time since 1997			1
the single vehicle entrance fee would increase from $ 25 to $ 30 for a seven - day pass , and the individual and motorcycle rate of $ 12 would increase to $ 15 per individual and to $ 25 per motorcycle			0
the individual park 's annual pass would increase from $ 50 to $ 60			0
the cost of national park system passes will remain at $ 80 for the regular annual pass , $ 10 for the lifetime senior pass and free for the annual military passes and access passes ( for those with permanent disabilities )			2
these are five national park sites we think you must see , either now or after any fee increases take effect			1
they 're still a bargain ! @entity1 , @entity51 the @entity52 cuts through the bottom of the magnificent @entity1 for 277 miles , and it 's a full vertical mile from the @entity55 to the canyon floor			1
the canyon 's width varies , but it measures 18 miles in several spots			0
the @entity55 is open year - round , but the @entity55 -- generally the coolest place in the park -- is open during the spring and summer			0
current vehicle entrance fee : $ 25 @entity1 filled with river of clouds @entity25 , @entity65 @entity25 , which released its fee proposal in october , wants to increase its weekly entrance pass from $ 20 to $ 30			1
camping fees would rise from the current range of $ 5 to $ 20 per night for family sites ( $ 40 per night for group sites ) to a range of $ 6 to $ 24 per night for family sites ( $ 48 per night for group sites )			2
president @entity75 first protected @entity25 with his signing of the @entity77 on june 30 , 1864 , 150 years ago			2
@entity25 will celebrate 125 years as a national park in 2015			1
@entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 @entity83 calls this place home			0
established as the @entity21 ' first national park in 1872 , @entity26 is also one of the first 12 sites on @entity90 's @entity89 , which recognizes the world 's most important natural and cultural wonders			2
@entity26 is one of the few remaining intact ecosystems of significant size in the northern temperate zone on @entity96 , including a volcano , more than 300 geysers and more than 10,000 thermal features			0
current vehicle entrance fee : $ 25 @entity101 , @entity102 @entity101 is one of the most unique spots on @entity96 , home to the world 's highest collection of natural sandstone arches			0
they include the largest , @entity108 , and the tallest , @entity109			0
current vehicle entrance fee : $ 10 @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 it 's free ! despite its reign as the most - visited national park in the country last year , with 9.4 million visitors , @entity110 is our bargain park , with no entrance fees			1
( there are camping and other amenity fees			0
) that 's because the park 's @entity123 was once owned by the state of @entity112			0
when the state transferred it to the federal government , the state required that no fee " ever be imposed " to travel the road .			0

@entity4 *allowing* fee increases for first time in 8 years
@entity1 , @entity25 and *131* other park sites charge fees
national parks are still a bargain
