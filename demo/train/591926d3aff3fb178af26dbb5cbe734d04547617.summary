-- it is always risky to make predictions about the @entity4 's decisions based on what is or is not said by lawyers and justices at oral argument			1
it is also almost impossible to resist the temptation to hunt through the transcripts for clues and tea leaves			0
on wednesday , the justices heard arguments in a case called @entity16 v. @entity17 , which involves a challenge to a small @entity21 's practice of opening its board meetings with short prayers , delivered by volunteers			1
a lower federal court ruled last year that the town of @entity16 's prayers -- but not necessarily all legislative prayers -- violate the @entity30 's rule against " establishments " of religion			1
arguing for those challenging the prayer was one of the most respected legal scholars in @entity37 , @entity38			1
as his argument time was running down , justice @entity39 -- one of the two justices nominated by president @entity41 -- shared an interesting and revealing observation			0
she emphasized how important it is to " maintain a multireligious society in a peaceful and harmonious way " and then added , " every time the court gets involved in things like this , it seems to make the problem worse rather than better			0
" a clue ? perhaps			0
the @entity4 's decisions and doctrines about church - state relations , religious liberty , and the role of faith in public life are regularly criticized as unpredictable and unprincipled			1
why , for example , is a large @entity62 monument on the grounds of the @entity64 acceptable while a display in a @entity67 courthouse that includes a framed copy of the @entity62 is not ? why did the justices permit a @entity73 city 's @entity71 display , which included a creche , but disapprove @entity75 's , which did also			0
to many observers , the court 's rulings seem to have done more to cause discord and dissonance than -- borrowing @entity39 's words -- peace and harmony and , at wednesday 's session , many of the justices appeared to share her concern			0
over and again , they pressed the attorneys to identify clear lines and straightforward rules that courts , legislators and citizens might use to separate permissible religious solemnizations from unconstitutional religious establishments			0
it would be clear and straightforward , of course , to say the @entity98 bans all officially sponsored prayers at government meetings and functions			1
however , to say this would also conflict glaringly with @entity37 history and traditions , going back to the founding			2
in fact , one of the first things the first @entity109 did when it assembled in 1789 was to select chaplains for the @entity112 and the @entity113			0
this is why , 30 years ago , in the case of @entity117 , the court held that legislative prayers offered by a paid chaplain did not violate the @entity30 and it is probably also why none of the justices indicated that he or she is inclined , at this late date , to change course so dramatically			2
nor did a majority of the justices seem inclined to treat volunteer - led prayers at town board meetings like potentially coercive invocations at public school graduations and football games			1
one suggestion to the justices was that legislative prayers be " nonsectarian " and avoid religious issues and theological claims on which there is significant disagreement			2
several of the justices appeared to agree that this would be a sensible policy			0
at the same time , most were leery of making this good practice a constitutional requirement , of forcing trial court judges into the tricky and delicate business of parsing and perusing prayers , or of policing a line between allowable prayers that invoke " almighty @entity147 " and over-the - line ones that address " @entity149			2
" our country is , as @entity39 noted , a " multireligious society " and so it is both unsurprising and unavoidable that @entity37 sometimes disagree about the role and place of religious faith in our public life			1
it is just as much a fact about our country that , from the very beginning , we have tried to respect religious faith and protect religious liberty , in private and in public			1
our tradition and practice has not been to regard public acknowledgments of religion and public requests for divine guidance as inconsistent with our founders ' wise decision to distinguish between , or " separate , " church and state			2
a decision by the court to uphold the town board 's prayers in @entity16 will probably not clear up all the questions about or patch up all the holes in the court 's @entity30 case law			1
however , such a decision , one that relies on precedent and avoids any dramatic changes in direction , will avoid making things worse			0
and , as @entity39 reminded us , that is no small thing			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

@entity4 hears case challenging prayer at town board meeting
@entity190 says court will likely be *reluctant* to uphold a ban on such prayers
@entity190 : @entity98 *prohibits* establishment of religion , but public prayers have long history
@entity190 : @entity37 has long tried to protect both religious faith and religious liberty
