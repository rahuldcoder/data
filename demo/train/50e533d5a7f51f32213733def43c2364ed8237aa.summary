all were brought to you by introverts			1
our culture is biased against quiet and reserved people , but introverts are responsible for some of humanity 's greatest achievements -- from @entity15 's invention of the @entity17 computer to @entity19 's @entity18			1
and these introverts did what they did not in spite of their temperaments -- but because of them			1
as the science journalist @entity32 writes : " the glory of the disposition that stops to consider stimuli rather than rushing to engage with them is its long association with intellectual and artistic achievement			2
neither @entity33 nor @entity34 was dashed off by a party animal			2
" watch an interview with @entity37 introverts make up a third to a half the population			1
that 's one out of every two or three people you know			1
yet our most important institutions -- our schools and our workplaces -- are designed for extroverts			2
and we 're living with a value system that i call the @entity51 , where we believe that all creativity and productivity comes from an oddly gregarious place			1
when i was a kid , we sat in rows of desks , and we did most of our work autonomously			1
but nowadays many students sit in " pods " of desks with four or five students facing each other , and they work on countless group projects -- even in subjects like math and creative writing			1
kids who prefer to work by themselves do n't fit , and research by educational psychology professor @entity70 found that the majority of teachers believe the ideal student is an extrovert -- even though introverts tend to get higher grades , according to psychologist @entity77			1
@entity78 : @entity79 praises slowness the same thing happens at work			1
many of us now work in offices without walls , with no respite from the noise and gaze of co-workers			1
and introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions , even though the latest research by the management professor @entity94 at @entity95 shows that introverted leaders often deliver better results			1
they 're better at letting proactive employees run with their creative ideas , while extroverts can unwittingly put their own stamp on things and not realize that other people 's ideas are n't being heard			1
of course , we all fall at different points along the introvert - extrovert spectrum			2
even @entity108 , who popularized these terms in the first place , said there was no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert -- that " such a man would be in a lunatic asylum			0
" there 's also a term , ambivert , for people who fall smack in the middle of the spectrum			1
but many of us recognize ourselves as one or the other			0
and culturally we need a better balance of yin and yang between the two types			0
in fact , we often seek out this balance instinctively			0
that 's why we see so many introvert - extrovert couples ( i 'm an introvert happily married to an extrovert ) and the most effective work teams have been found to be a mix of the two types			1
@entity78 : using our practical wisdom the need for balance is especially important when it comes to creativity and productivity			1
when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people , they almost always find a serious streak of introversion because solitude is a crucial ingredient for creativity			2
@entity148 took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations			0
@entity152 , better known as dr. @entity152 , dreamed up his creations in a private bell tower in the back of his house in @entity157			0
@entity15 invented the first @entity17 computer alone in his cubicle at @entity160			0
of course , this does n't mean that we should stop collaborating with each other -- witness @entity15 teaming up with @entity164 to form @entity17			0
but it does mean that solitude matters			0
and for some people it 's the air they breathe			2
in fact , we 've known about the transcendent power of solitude for centuries ; it 's only recently that we 've forgotten it			2
our major religions all tell the story of seekers -- @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 -- who go off alone , to the wilderness , and bring profound revelations back to the community			0
no wilderness , no revelations			0
this is no surprise , if you listen to the insights of contemporary psychology			0
it turns out that you ca n't be in a group without instinctively mimicking others ' opinions -- even about personal , visceral things like who you 're physically attracted to			0
we ape other people 's beliefs without even realizing we 're doing it			2
groups also tend to follow the most dominant person in the room even though there 's zero correlation between good ideas and being a good talker			1
the best talker might have the best ideas , but she might not			0
so it 's much better to send people off to generate ideas by themselves , freed from the distortion of group dynamics , and only then come together as a team			2
i 'm not saying that social skills are unimportant , or that we should abolish teamwork			0
the same religions that send their sages off to lonely mountaintops also teach us love and trust			0
and the problems we face today in fields like economics and science are more complex than ever , and need armies of people to solve them			0
but i am saying that we all need alone time			0
and that the more freedom we give introverts to be themselves , the more they 'll dream up their own unique solutions to the problems that bedevil us .			1

@entity37 : many of the world 's great advances have been made by introverts
she says society puts *pressure* on children and *adults* to work in groups
" @entity51 " can get in the way of *imagination* and creativity , she says
@entity37 : give introverts the freedom to be themselves
