@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a very clever television advertisement , @entity4 candidate @entity3 looks directly at the camera and says to voters : " i 'm not a witch			1
" in another ad , @entity3 says that unlike her @entity13 opponent @entity12 , " i did n't go to @entity11			1
i did n't inherit millions like my opponent			0
" this statement , in a nutshell , is the message of the @entity20 movement			0
@entity3 promises that she will not follow the practices of @entity23 incumbents who believe that trading favors and making backroom deals are legitimate ways to stay in office			2
@entity3 is not alone in advancing this message			2
in @entity31 , @entity13 gov. @entity30 is facing an unexpectedly difficult race against @entity34 @entity33 to fill the seat of the late sen. @entity36			1
according to @entity40 , the casting call for an advertisement that was recently broadcast by the @entity39 in @entity31 stated that they were searching for the " ' @entity44 ' @entity43 look			0
... these characters are from @entity31 so think coal miners / trucker looks			0
" many conservative candidates this year have been tapping into the tradition of conservative populism , a tradition that has animated right - wing politics since the 1970s			0
in their effort to challenge the legacy of the @entity55 and the @entity57 programs and to overcome the image of country club conservatism , many in the @entity34 have argued their party best represents average @entity61			1
they have focused on social and cultural issues and anti-establishment rhetoric to claim this mantle			0
in 2008 , @entity67 gov. @entity66 , a potential presidential candidate in 2012 , talked about " @entity69 republicans			0
" the problem they have to overcome is there is a major disconnect between their message and the record of the @entity34 in which they are running			2
when @entity78 became president in 1981 , he advanced the agenda of supply side economics and economic deregulation			1
his policies have defined the @entity34 ever since			2
according to @entity78 , economic policies that benefited the wealthiest @entity61 would have a trickle - down effect that eventually helped lower - income brackets			1
regressive tax cuts that benefit wealthier @entity61 but generate deficits were also fine since , in the long run , more revenue would flow into the @entity91 from rising wages			2
the voices of conservatives who were skeptical of the theory of supply - side economics rapidly faded away			1
that includes @entity98 , who in 1980 called @entity78 's proposals " voodoo economics			1
" in his book " @entity104 , " political scientist @entity101 has documented the effect of these policies			0
during the conservative era of @entity61 politics , the so - called @entity109 , the distribution of income and wages has become more unequal in the @entity61 than in comparable countries			1
" under @entity13 presidents , " @entity101 writes , " poor families did slightly better than richer families ( at least in proportional terms ) , producing a modest net decrease in income inequality ; under @entity34 presidents , rich families did vastly better than poorer families , producing a considerable net increase in income inequality			1
" see more @entity2 opinion articles while there are a number of factors behind these changes , public policy mattered very much			0
according to @entity101 ' persuasive account , rising inequality was not just a result of natural market forces such as globalization , but also a product of partisan choices about the direction of economic and fiscal policy			0
@entity61 , he shows , in all income brackets have enjoyed more economic success when @entity13 inhabit the @entity143			1
meanwhile , the economic policies of @entity34 presidents , such as regressive tax cuts , have disproportionately benefited the wealthy			1
in another book , political scientists @entity147 and @entity148 have reached a similar conclusion			0
they have shown how the mobilization of business in @entity23 during the 1970s profoundly effected inequality			0
allying with the @entity34 , the business community pushed for the deregulation of numerous industries , tax cuts for the upper - income classes and policies that weakened organized labor			1
the result , according to @entity147 and @entity148 , were policies that left working - and middle - class @entity61 at the mercy of powerful market forces			2
playing defense , many @entity13 , including president @entity166 , followed this agenda as well			2
although president @entity169 has continued part of the centrist approach of @entity166 on many economic issues , he has also pursued economic policies that have focused on working - and middle - class @entity61			2
his economic stimulus program revolved around government spending for projects that would bring jobs to the unemployed and prevent other jobs from disappearing			0
his health care reform will expand coverage to more than 30 million @entity61 who have been left outside the market			0
he has pushed for an extension of the @entity98 tax cuts to all but the highest - income @entity61			2
to be sure , he has been far from successful			0
the high unemployment rate is evidence that the success of @entity169 's policies have been limited , and the administration made compromises that avoided more stringent constraints on powerful interests			0
given the history , @entity3 's ad , as good as it is as a piece of political theater , has its problems			1
her website suggests that @entity3 , like most @entity20 candidates , will not depart that greatly from the @entity34 's economic policies of tax reductions , deregulation and the curtailment of government spending			1
it might very well be that @entity3 is one of us , but her party 's economic policies have tended to benefit a very narrow and well - off portion of the population			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			0

@entity3 's campaign , ads stress populist theme of " i 'm you "
@entity214 : @entity34 policies have helped wealthy and increased inequality
he says the @entity34 has supported supply - side economics , deregulation since @entity78
under @entity13 , @entity61 of all income have done better , @entity214 says
