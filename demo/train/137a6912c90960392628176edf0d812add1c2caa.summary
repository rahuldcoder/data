the @entity0 voiced concern friday about the case of an @entity4 citizen in prison in @entity6 , whom a @entity8 report alleges was tortured			1

he was sentenced a year later by a @entity6 court to 10 years in jail on charges of unlawful assembly , intent to kill police , destruction of police vehicles and possession of @entity27 cocktails			1
the @entity4 has said little about the case of @entity10 , born in @entity29 to a @entity31 father and a @entity6 mother , citing privacy laws			1
after his family produced a @entity37 waiver , authorizing the @entity4 government to talk about the case , the @entity0 finally said this week it had concerns about the fairness of @entity10 's trial , as well as his " safety and welfare , his treatment in prison , including his medical and nutritional needs			0
" " this a case that we 've taken very seriously , " said @entity49 , a @entity0 spokesman , indicating the government has raised this " at the highest levels of the government of @entity6			1
" the @entity6 government has denied the charges , insisting it has a " zero tolerance " policy on torture			1
a report by the @entity62 documents sources saying that @entity10 was forced to make a false confession under torture that he assaulted a police officer by throwing a stone at him			1
with no physical evidence , the conviction was based on that confession , the report said , adding that " mr. @entity10 and his mother were able to credibly testify that he was at home the time that the crime was allegedly committed			0
" the group called for @entity10 's release			0
a representative of @entity10 's family confirmed to @entity80 details in the @entity8 report , including that @entity10 says his confession was extracted by acts of torture , including beatings in the chest and head , forcing him to stand for long periods despite a spinal condition and denying him access to a bathroom			1
since his conviction , @entity10 has endured " further abuse and mistreatment , " according to the report and representatives of the @entity78			0

@entity127 has tempered its concerns about @entity6 's human rights record and its heavy - handed crackdown on a popular uprising			2
local and human rights groups charge many @entity13 @entity6 youths have been arbitrarily arrested and jailed for alleged crimes against security forces			1
calling @entity10 's arrest and continued detention " arbitrary , " the @entity8 working group referred the allegations of his alleged abuse to the @entity141 on torture and called on the @entity6 government to immediately release him and grant him compensation for the " harm he has suffered			1
