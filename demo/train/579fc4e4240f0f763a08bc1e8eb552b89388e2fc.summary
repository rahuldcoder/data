-- the @entity1 was negotiating an extension of its fact - finding mission in @entity4 thursday , with its members due to report over the weekend on what they have witnessed of a months - long government crackdown on protests			1
ambassador @entity9 , the @entity10 - based head of the monitoring operation , said the league and the @entity4 government were negotiating an extension to their mandate , which was scheduled to end thursday			1
a senior @entity1 official , who could not be named because he was not authorized to speak on the matter , said the monitors would remain in @entity4 while the issue was discussed -- and that all signs pointed to an extension being agreed to by both sides			1
a handful of @entity1 members will meet saturday , led by @entity25 , before the full 22 - state body meets sunday in @entity10 to discuss the monitors ' final findings , the official said			1
the @entity29 is not sending monitors itself but is providing technical training to the @entity1 observers , he added			1
the uprising , driven by calls for president @entity36 's resignation , reforms and democratic elections , is in its 10th month			2
it has prompted a bloody government crackdown that has claimed at least 5,000 lives since it began in march , according to the @entity29			0
opposition groups put the death toll at more than 6,000			0
the @entity1 has called on @entity44 to stop violence against civilians , free political detainees , remove tanks and weapons from cities and allow outsiders , including the international news media , to travel freely around @entity4			1
the purpose of its month - long fact - finding mission was to see if the government was adhering to an agreement to end the violence			1
but opposition activists and human rights monitors say the @entity4 government has not stopped its aggressive actions against protesters since the mission began december 26 , and have questioned the mission 's effectiveness			1
meanwhile , opposition activist groups continue to report outbreaks of violence elsewhere around the country			2
the @entity68 , an opposition umbrella group , said 25 people were killed thursday , including seven in @entity70 , six in @entity71 and four in @entity72			1
four people were killed in @entity75 and three in the @entity44 suburbs , with one more death in @entity78 , the group said			0
gunfire was reported in many neighborhoods in @entity71 , with mourners at a mosque also coming under fire			0
some roads out of the city have been closed off , while snipers are positioned on rooftops , the @entity68 said			0
in @entity94 , a suburb of @entity44 , the naked body of a young man bearing signs of torture was found in the street , the group said , adding that government security forces took the body and arrested several people			0
the @entity99 earlier said one civilian was killed and seven wounded in @entity72 thursday by mortar rounds fired at the neighborhood of @entity104			0
another four activists , who were in hiding , were shot dead in the @entity70 region when security forces ambushed them in a mountain village , the observatory said			0
the @entity68 said 21 people were killed by government troops wednesday			0
the @entity1 monitors have been greeted ecstatically in some @entity4 cities , where residents have recounted tales of government brutality			1
in the town of @entity119 , which monitors visited tuesday , one demonstrator spray - painted the letters " @entity122 " on a wall			2
on sunday , crowds in @entity125 carried the monitors on their shoulders and urged them to stay to prevent reprisals			2
@entity4 activists said wednesday that opposition forces had wrested control of @entity125 from government troops			1
they maintained control of the city thursday , activists said			2
" there was massive protests in @entity125 , so the @entity138 tried to disperse them			0
but our troops were very organized and aggressive with a counter attack that left them fleeing and they withdrew completely out of the city , " said lt. col. @entity141 of the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) , a group made up of former government soldiers			0
" our forces raised the flag of independence in @entity125			0
" @entity141 said , though , that the opposition fighters " expect another confrontation " as the government forces regroup outside the town			0
although a number of journalists have been allowed into the country in recent days to travel with @entity1 monitors on their fact - finding mission , @entity0 can not verify many accounts of what is happening in @entity4 because the government restricts the activities of journalists			1
the @entity165 announced wednesday it was planning new sanctions against companies and individuals in @entity4 , as it seeks to put pressure on the @entity36 regime			2
while western powers have imposed sanctions on @entity4 during the 10 - month crackdown , opposition by @entity175 and @entity176 has kept the @entity177 from following suit			1
the @entity36 government says it is fighting armed terrorist groups , which it blames for the violence			0
@entity0 's @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			2

new : opposition activists report 25 deaths across @entity4 thursday
the monitors will stay in @entity4 while an extension to their mission is discussed , an official says
@entity1 member states will meet over the weekend to discuss the mission 's findings
