-- substitute @entity1 scored a late header as champions @entity3 fought back from three goals down to earn a remarkable 3 - 3 @entity5 draw at @entity6 on sunday			1
on a bitterly cold afternoon in south - west @entity7 , @entity3 knew they needed a victory at @entity9 to keep pace with rivals @entity11 at the top of the table			1
but they got off to a poor start and went into the interval a goal behind after defender @entity17 had inadvertently turned @entity19 's cross into his own net			0
and @entity3 then suffered a double blow early in the second half as two goals in the space of just five minutes looked to have handed @entity6 victory			1
with the second 45 minutes barely a minute old , @entity27 ' crash was superbly volleyed home by fellow - @entity30 @entity29 to double @entity6 's lead			0
and @entity3 's defense was found wanting again soon afterwards when @entity33 was left unmarked to head home a free - kick			0
the visitors had been denied two first - half penalty appeals by referee @entity38 , but the @entity40 final official had no hesitation in pointing to the spot when @entity19 fouled @entity43 in the area			0
@entity45 smashed home the 58th minute spot - kick to make it 3 - 1 and @entity45 again held his nerve from the spot just 11 minutes later , this time @entity51 was adjudged to have tripped @entity52			1
by now @entity3 were in the ascendency , and they drew level when @entity1 found space in the area to head home @entity59 ' cross from close range six minutes from time			0
however , only a superb flying save from much - criticized @entity3 goalkeeper @entity62 , to keep out @entity29 's last - minute free - kick , ensured the points were shared			2
despite the fightback , @entity3 lose ground in the title race , with @entity11 now two points ahead of their rivals , with a much better goal difference as well			2
@entity6 remain in fourth place on 43 points , but @entity73 are now only a point behind in fifth after their @entity76 international strikers combined to beat @entity77 2 - 1			1
@entity78 scored his 16th goal of the season , second only to @entity82 's @entity81 , to give @entity73 the lead , only for @entity84 to level for @entity77 from close range			0
but debutant @entity86 secured the three points for @entity73 with a stunning strike that arrowed into the top corner of the @entity77 net with 19 minutes remaining .			2

@entity3 fight back from 3 - 0 down to earn a draw at @entity6
two @entity45 penalties sparked the *recovery* in the second half
the result leaves @entity3 two points behind @entity11 in @entity5
@entity73 defeat @entity77 2 - 1 to move up to fifth , a point behind @entity6
