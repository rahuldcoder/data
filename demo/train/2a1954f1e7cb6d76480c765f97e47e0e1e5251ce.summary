-- @entity1 believed he had much more important business to deal with at @entity3 , and in many ways , he 's probably right			1
he is overseeing a massive merger between the university and the state 's medical schools , one that will shape higher education in @entity11 for generations			2
but now there was an issue involving a videotape of his basketball coach			0
this was early december , just after @entity3 had received a much - celebrated invitation to the @entity20			1
the tape contained clips of @entity23 throwing basketballs at his players , shoving them and cursing at them , and using a homophobic slur			1
when it was given to @entity28 months later , it dominated the airwaves for a week and sparked a scandal that rocked the @entity3 athletic department and , for many alums , disgraced the school			1
the tape overshadowed everything @entity1 was trying to accomplish on the @entity38 , @entity11 , campus			0
but he never watched that tape until after it aired			0
" it was a revelation , " @entity1 said a few weeks later , " that the intensity of the response , both within the community , within the state and nationally on this very important and very serious issue could totally swamp out all of the other issues we 're trying to deal with and color everything else we 're doing			0
" @entity50 is n't the right word			2
@entity1 is n't the first university president -- and he wo n't be the last -- to learn how a scandal in college athletics can shape his administration or , for some , end it entirely			1
that 's what happened at @entity59 when @entity60 was forced to resign in november 2011 after his weak response to the scandal involving former football coach @entity63			2
@entity63 was arrested and charged with 52 counts of sexual abuse of young boys			0
as another @entity20 school , @entity69 , dealt with an @entity72 scandal involving rules violations with its longtime coach @entity74 , university president @entity67 was asked if he considered making a change in his football program			1
he famously responded , " i 'm just hoping the coach does n't dismiss me , " a one - liner he came to regret when @entity74 was later forced to resign			0
what happened at @entity3 was nowhere close to those levels			2
still , it should serve as a reminder to all college presidents that sports , while a small part of the university mission as a whole , are a huge factor in shaping the public image of a school and dominate media attention			1
@entity1 went from a mostly anonymous administrator , an acclaimed neuroscientist who became the 20th president at @entity3 during an important time in its history , to an embattled leader listening to calls for his dismissal from sports columnists , politicians and faculty			1
that , he admitted , was frustrating			0
" i guess i learned that this is one area that i have to be involved with process right from the beginning , " he said , " that i have to understand that the processes are in place and being followed from the beginning and not assume that they 're in place , and i have to be fully sensitive to the multiplier and how easily the game knob gets turned up on this , and spillover on everything else we 're trying to do			0
" it was a lesson he kept learning			0
@entity1 fired @entity23 and forced out athletic director @entity120			1
he promised a thorough background check on his choices to replace both men but then was further embarrassed when the website @entity125 uncovered that new basketball coach @entity126 did not have a degree from the university , as his official bio claimed			2
that was small potatoes in comparison to the story that broke involving his new athletic director			1
@entity135 had promised a " new day " when she was hired in april , vowing that " there 's no one that does n't agree about how we treat young people with respect and dignity and build trust " at @entity3			1
but she had , herself , been an abusive coach at @entity145 , according to a dozen former players interviewed by @entity147 , accused of many of same things that got @entity23 fired			2
@entity150 countered that , while she was a " super intense " coach , she was never abusive			0
then , two days later , the @entity151 first reported that @entity150 was at the center of a sex discrimination suit at @entity154 , where she worked for 16 years as a senior administrator			0
a jury initially awarded $ 300,000 to an assistant track coach in the case , but a @entity161 appeals court later overturned the verdict			0
@entity1 received a vote of confidence from @entity11 gov. @entity165 , who declared that hiring @entity150 was " not my call " and that he was " confident in president @entity1 's judgment " on his weekly radio show			0
but how could @entity3 hire anyone with a questionable coaching background after the @entity23 debacle ? and how did the university fail to contact any of these former players through what was supposed to be a thorough vetting process ? the story again painted @entity3 as a laughingstock			1
the headline on @entity179 late tuesday declared , " @entity3 back to being a punchline , " while @entity180 wondered , " does @entity3 even know how to run an athletic department ? " the real question : how did @entity1 fail to understand the reach of a college athletics scandal ? the university president , like many before him on other campuses , found out the hard way			1
" i regret that i did not ask to see this video , " @entity1 said when the @entity23 scandal broke			1
the satellite trucks were lined up in front of his office , and much to his chagrin , nobody wanted to talk about that historic merger with the medical schools			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2
