@entity7 @entity1 momentum to oust @entity2 from @entity4 leadership during tuesday 's election for speaker continued to build through the weekend , with two alternatives emerging and a national conservative group joining the effort			1
on monday , @entity13 rep. - elect @entity12 became the latest to confirm his intention to vote against @entity2 for speaker			1
on sunday night , @entity16 rep. @entity15 and @entity18 rep. @entity17 also came out opposed to @entity2			1
in an op - ed published on @entity20 , @entity17 outlined a litany of complaints with the speaker , arguing @entity2 has n't done enough to oppose president @entity24 's signature health care law or the president 's executive action on immigration and pointing to passage of the recent government funding bill , which tackled neither , as evidence			1
leadership aides , however , remain confident that @entity2 will hold onto his position as the top @entity33 in the @entity4			1
conservatives need to gather nearly 30 lawmakers opposed to him to force a second round of voting in the race			1
but the developing coup attempt is the latest reminder for the @entity42 @entity33 that conservatives remain a troublesome and unpredictable force in his caucus that can cause public embarrassment if not out - and - out regime change			2
" we need a speaker who will help us all keep our oath , including his own , to the @entity51 , not one who has consistently blocked our efforts to keep ours			2
i will vote for an alternative candidate for speaker , " @entity17 wrote			2
those frustrations are shared by many of his fellow conservatives , and the passage of the cromnibus last month pushed already simmering tensions with @entity2 to a boiling point			1
and it threatens to start things off on precisely the wrong foot for republicans as they take full control of @entity68 and seek to prove to @entity69 they 're the party that can govern in time for 2016			0
there are at least 10 lawmakers who have publicly said they 'll oppose @entity2 or vote " present " in the election for speaker			1
@entity76 of @entity77 and @entity78 of @entity79 both offered themselves up as alternatives to @entity2 this weekend , after two prominent conservatives in the @entity4 — rep. @entity83 of @entity84 and @entity85 of @entity86 — came out publicly opposed to him			1
@entity88 rep. @entity87 , an early organizer of the effort to unseat @entity2 , told a local @entity88 paper that he plans to support rep. @entity91 of @entity77 , whose name will also be offered as an alternative to @entity2 on tuesday			1
" i want us to have a leader who is willing to stand up for conservative , religious principles i believe in			0
it is to make a statement and it 's based on many months of consideration , " @entity87 said			0
national conservative group @entity100 has launched a national campaign in support of the effort , urging its members to call their lawmaker and tell them to vote against the @entity42 @entity33 as speaker			0
and @entity83 launched a short - lived website pitching @entity78 as speaker that included endorsements from both himself and @entity85 for the @entity79 @entity33 , which was soon after wiped of its content			1
still , none of the lawmakers who have offered themselves as potential alternatives are favorites of the far - right			1
other prominent conservatives , including @entity117 host @entity116 , have offered rep. @entity118 up for the job , but @entity118 has declined			0
a coup attempt orchestrated by many of the same lawmakers two years ago fell short of the votes needed to force a second ballot , with only a dozen conservatives voting against @entity2			1
and since then , many of those have expressed a change of heart , coming out in support of the @entity42 @entity33 as speaker — including prominent conservative reps			2
@entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			0
but conservatives say they 're confident now that alternative options have stepped forward , they can corral the needed votes to at least force the election to a second ballot , where they hope @entity2 will drop out of the race			1
they also note that many members of the freshman class promised to vote against @entity2 on the campaign trail — including @entity12 , the @entity33 who ousted former majority leader @entity147 in a primary -- and are looking to them to round out their numbers			2
on monday morning , @entity12 stood by that promise , also in an op - ed on @entity152			0
it 's unclear what efforts leadership has undertaken to whip support for the speaker			2
@entity158 rep. - elect @entity157 , the @entity33 freshman class president , said he has n't heard from the speaker — but he has heard from @entity2 's opponents			1
" i have not talked to anybody in the speaker 's office			0
i have not talked to the speaker			0
i have not heard that he is reaching out to anybody in the freshman class , " @entity157 told @entity8 in an interview monday			0
" on the other end , i have received some calls			0
" @entity169 , a conservative strategist and editor of @entity171 , said that the situation is " very fluid " but expressed cautious optimism			0
" this is a much more robust effort than any of us ever hoped , " he said			0
he noted , however , that " things could still fall apart " in the final day before the election , and that he expects @entity2 and his allies are applying heavy pressure on the incoming freshmen to make sure they fall in line			2
following the last coup attempt , a handful of the members who voted against @entity2 were removed from their positions on plum @entity4 committees			2
this time around , conservatives say they 're not worried about punishment			0
@entity76 said on monday during an interview on @entity117 that " i fear no man			2
" " there should not be any retribution			0
we 're doing what my voters want me to do , " he said			0
but he promised to support whomever eventually wins the election for speaker — at least for the next session			0
" i 'll go up to ' em , i 'll thank ' em and i 'll tell ' em , you 're the speaker for the next two years , and i look forward to working with you to solve @entity69 's problems , " he said			0
