their complaint alleges that @entity2 was " subjected to harassing interrogation , and unlawfully detained			2
" @entity50 of the @entity44 said the @entity3 is suffering from mission creep			1
" we think what happened to mr. @entity2 is a reflection that @entity3 believes passenger screening is an opportunity to engage in freewheeling law enforcement investigations that have no link to flight safety , " he said			1
@entity50 believes many other passengers have been subjected to the same kind of treatment , which he claims violates constitutional protections against unlawful searches			2

" you 're in a locked room with no windows			0
you 've got @entity3 agent			1
you 've got police officers with loaded guns			0
they 're in your face			0
a few of them were swearing at me			0
" but the officers did not follow through on their threats			0
near the end of the recording an additional officer enters the situation and realizes the origins of the money			1
officer : so these are campaign contributions for @entity20 ? @entity2 : yes , sir			0
officer : you 're free to go			0
according to the @entity3 , " passengers are required to cooperate with the screening process			1
