-- @entity1 returned from the international rugby wilderness to score two tries as @entity4 opened their @entity6 campaign with an 18 - 9 victory away to @entity8 on sunday			1
the center made his first start since being cast aside after fabricating a tale of being assaulted during @entity4 's tour of @entity13 in june last year			1
the 21 - year - old crossed for his first five - point scores at the highest level , having made his debut in the 2009 @entity6 before causing controversy when he claimed he had been attacked outside his hotel to explain facial injuries			1
he later admitted being drunk and falling over a table in his room , but speculation over the incident continued and @entity27 sports paper @entity25 reported that he had psychiatric treatment following a suicide attempt			0
however , @entity1 scored the first try of the game in @entity32 in the 12th minute following a five - meter scrum , and powered over the line again out on the left seven minutes before halftime			2
scrumhalf @entity36 converted to give @entity4 a 15 - 6 lead and then kicked his second penalty five minutes after the interval			2
@entity40 , playing his 99th international for @entity8 , kicked his third penalty to reduce the deficit but the home side never looked like breaching the try line of last year 's third - placed team as @entity4 could afford to see @entity36 miss another attempt at goal			1
@entity8 coach @entity49 was left to rue defensive lapses ahead of next weekend 's trip to @entity52 , who lost 30 - 17 to @entity54 on saturday			2
" we conceded two soft scores , and if we do that we 're not going to beat anybody , " the @entity57 told reporters			0
" it was hard against a good @entity27 scrum			0
the @entity27 were very canny in what they did			0

" it was a good performance after some problems in july			0
he had a great match with two tries and some great defense , " @entity63 said .			0
