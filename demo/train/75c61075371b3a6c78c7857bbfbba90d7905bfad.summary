-- federal accident investigators issued two " urgent " recommendations to the @entity3 on friday urging action to prevent another crash similar to one this week in which an unoccupied @entity3 train collided with another at a station , injuring 33 people			1
the @entity11 told the authority in a letter that it needed to take steps , including using wheel chocks , to prevent trains from moving unintentionally			1
@entity3 said in response it had taken those and other steps immediately after the crash on monday			1
the accident occurred when a four - car train -- unoccupied but powered up -- departed the @entity23 where it was awaiting repairs			0
it traveled almost a mile downhill through five devices designed to stop trains , eventually colliding with an occupied train stopped at the @entity29 on @entity3 's @entity30			1
some 33 passengers were injured			2
those who were hospitalized have been released , authorities said			0
the empty train movement remains under investigation , but the @entity3 said neither criminal conduct nor vandalism is suspected			1
the safety board said unoccupied @entity3 trains are " routinely left powered up " while stored at the repair yard			1
but @entity3 spokesman @entity41 disputed that , saying trains are typically powered up prior to going into service			2
@entity41 said preliminary indications show the train was powered up at the time of the incident , but it was unclear when it was scheduled to depart the repair yard to go to another maintenance yard			0
" that 's one of the questions we are trying to answer , " he said			0
the @entity11 said the investigation continues , noting that one of the cars had heat - damaged wiring and water in electrical connection boxes			1
@entity41 said the @entity3 has inspected about half of the 600 to 700 cars in its fleet without finding similar damage			2
the inspections were to be completed this weekend , he said			0
the @entity11 typically rolls out recommendations at the conclusion of investigations , but can issue guidance earlier if it identifies a safety problem			2
in this case , it issued the recommendations while most of the agency was on furlough because of the government shutdown			0
the furlough rules allow for ongoing investigations in cases that are necessary to " prevent the imminent potential for loss of life and significant property damage			0
" the @entity11 also can launch investigations into " major accidents involving significant casualties			2
" the actions recommended by the board need " to be addressed expeditiously to prevent a recurrence , " @entity11 chairwoman @entity86 wrote in the letter to @entity91 , president of the @entity3			1
in addition to wheel chocks , the @entity11 recommended turning off propulsion power and using an alternative brake setting , and a system to derail cars before they enter the main track			0
the @entity11 also wrote to the @entity99 requesting it issue a safety advisory to all transit systems asking them to review operating and maintenance procedures for stored , unoccupied cars			1
all but 28 of the @entity99 's 529 employees have been furloughed			0
an @entity99 spokeswoman said that the administration complied and issued the safety advisory .			0
