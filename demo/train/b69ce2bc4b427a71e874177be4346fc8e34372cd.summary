@entity0 , @entity1 -- tens of thousands of demonstrators in eastern @entity0 marked the eighth anniversary of the fall of @entity8 's regime with a protest saturday against the @entity11 troop presence there			1
the demonstrators , followers of anti-american shiite cleric @entity13 , rallied in @entity14 , where they called all @entity11 troops to withdraw from @entity1 at the end of the year			1
the protesters carried @entity1 flag and banners , with some chanting " @entity0 is a free country , @entity11 get out ! " and " @entity20 , @entity21			1
" one banner read " no , no @entity11 , " while another said , " yes , yes for @entity24			2
" @entity11 troops are scheduled to depart from @entity1 at year 's end under a bilateral agreement between the @entity1 government and the @entity11			1
but if violence increases and instability persists in @entity1 , it is possible both countries could agree to keep some @entity11 troops in @entity1 , which now has about 47,000 @entity11 soldiers			1
the figure is down from a high of 171,000 in 2003			0
that prospect of @entity11 troops staying in @entity1 disturbs many citizens , including the thousands who support @entity13 , a cleric with grassroots appeal in @entity1 's @entity42 cities and neighborhoods			1
@entity44 , a cleric who read a statement to demonstrators on behalf of @entity13 , raised the prospect of @entity11 troops staying in @entity1 into next year and beyond			1
" what if the invading forces decide not to leave our country ? what if they decide to stay ? what if @entity11 troops and others decide to stay in our lands ? ...			1
will you keep silent ? " @entity44 said , reading @entity13 's statement to chants of " @entity61 is great			0
" " if they decide to stay in our country , then we have to do two things : first is to escalate armed resistance and lift the freeze on @entity66 , " @entity44 said			0
he was referring to the august 2007 suspension of the activities of the @entity66 , @entity13 's militia			0
@entity11 military commanders have cited that move as a major reason for a decline in violence across @entity1 , where @entity76 's forces fought @entity11 troops during the height of the war			1
emotions on the street were fueled by the remarks of @entity11 defense secretary @entity83 , who made an unannounced visit this week to @entity1 and discussed @entity11 troop presence with top officials , including prime minister @entity87			1
" my message to them was if there is to be a presence or they still need help , we are open to that possibility			0
but they have to ask , and time is running out in @entity99 because we have a lot going on around the world and we 've got to make some decisions , " @entity83 said			2
" it obviously would be a presence that 's a fraction of the size of the one we have here now but it 's really up to the @entity1 at this point			0
" on friday , street protesters in @entity0 and other provinces also focused on the fall of the @entity8 regime and grievances stemming from war , including an opposition to the @entity11 troop presence			2
that was a change of theme in recent weeks when demonstrators in @entity1 have rallied over the same bread - and - butter issues that have prompted street protests across the @entity121 world			0
people have been upset over corruption , unemployment , the lack of basic services and restrictions on freedom of expression			0
protesters in the @entity132 neighborhood of @entity133 called for the release of detainees and compensation for " the victims of the occupation			0
" " some of the protesters shouted , ' no to occupation , no to foreign troops , ' " witnesses said			0
in @entity0 's @entity146 , nearly 300 protesters carrying banners and @entity1 flags , shouted , " we will not accept life in an occupied country anymore			2
" one of the banners read , " no to @entity11 and @entity150 occupation ! " that includes a reference to @entity150 's influence with the @entity42 masses and the @entity1 government			2
women carried pictures of their sons and husbands who are missing or were killed during the war			0
" during this war , so many women lost sons and many others became widows , not only @entity1 women but also @entity11 women			2
we are the ones who paid the price of this war , " said @entity168 , who was among the protesters			0
hundreds also turned out in @entity175 , in the largely @entity132 @entity177 province in the west and in @entity179 , in @entity176 in the north to demand the release of detainees , compensation for victims ' families , and the departure of @entity11 troops			1
since 2003 , 4,421 @entity11 troops have died in @entity1 , according to the military figures counted by @entity2			1
a @entity11 - led invasion of @entity1 in march 2003 led to the removal of @entity8 's regime on april 9			2
the iconic toppling of the former ruler 's statue in @entity0 's @entity196 symbolizes the regime 's fall .			0
