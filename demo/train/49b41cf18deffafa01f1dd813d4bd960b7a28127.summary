-- the underwater probe being used to look for missing @entity2 was back in the water after its first attempt ended prematurely , said the company that owns the vehicle , @entity5			1
the @entity10 - 21 autonomous underwater vehicle was about four hours into its second dive mission at 2 p.m. et on tuesday ( 2 a.m. wednesday in @entity12 , @entity13 ) , a source close to the operation told @entity0 's @entity14			1
on monday , crews sent the probe toward the ocean floor on what was expected to be a 20 - hour deployment , only to have it return in less than eight hours after encountering waters beyond its 4,500 - meter ( 14,764 - foot ) maximum depth			1
the probe found no debris during its shortened scanning session			2
the second mission is expected to end wednesday around 10 a.m. et ( 10 p.m. in @entity12 ) , the source said			1
the vehicle was deployed in nearly the same area and is operating at about the same depth as the earlier mission , the source said			1
the earlier aborted mission does n't mean anything is wrong with the probe , which is designed to swim about 30 meters ( 100 feet ) above the ocean floor and use sound waves to draw a three - dimensional map of what lies below			1
" the vehicle 's tracking the floor , so when the floor dives , so does the vehicle			1
and the vehicle goes , ' uh oh , i 'm not supposed to be here ' and punches up , " said @entity39 , director of special projects at the @entity41			2
and while it 's disappointing the vehicle returned to the surface early , it 's not unusual , said @entity45 , ceo of @entity46 , the company that makes the probe			1
" we 've operated these vehicles around the globe			0
it 's not unusual to get into areas where the charts are n't accurate or you lack information , " @entity45 told @entity0 's " @entity56			2
" a @entity58 survey ship is working to determine the areas where the @entity10 can safely work without hitting its maximum dive depth , according to @entity5			1
@entity62 capt. @entity61 of the @entity10 search team said the initial launch monday night took place " in the very far corner of the area it 's searching , so they are just shifting the search box a little bit away from that deep water and proceeding with the search			1
" about 8 square miles were searched , said @entity75 , a spokesman for @entity5			0
it could take up to two months to scan the entire search area			0
the deputy director for salvage and diving for the @entity62 told @entity0 that the @entity10 may actually be able to go deeper than it was first programmed to do , engineers have determined			1
" we 've gone through and looked at all of the components in @entity10 , and we 're comfortable that we can exceed that 4,500 - meter limit at this point , " @entity84 told @entity0 's " the lead with @entity88			1
" we 're looking at , can we push @entity10 beyond 4,500 , potentially down to as deep as 5,000 ? there is some software , that software has been tested now			1
and we believe that , with some confidence , we could push @entity10 to that depth			1
" he said two - thirds of the search area was less than 4,500 meters deep			0
@entity84 said the @entity10 was chosen for this part of the search because it was the lightest , most nimble package and easiest to get on scene			1
it 's possible that a second vehicle that can operate deeper than the @entity10 will be needed			1
one possibility is a vehicle called @entity105 that is towed behind a ship			2
it remains under the water and sends back real - time data			0
it would be a more complex operation to put an @entity105 in the water but one is available in @entity113 if the @entity13 - led search team requests it			0
monday 's shortened mission was the latest glitch in a 40 - day search for the missing jetliner , which vanished march 8 with 239 passengers and crew on board after taking off from @entity123 , @entity124 , bound for @entity125			2
surface and satellite searches have turned up nothing conclusive -- and confusing , sometimes conflicting details from investigators have muddied the public image of the search and angered relatives of the missing			0
on tuesday , the @entity134 agreed to set up an international investigation to look into the plane 's disappearance			0
teams will look at the plane 's airworthiness , operational issues and human factors that may have played a role , officials said			0
@entity124 's acting transportation minister @entity144 also said tuesday that if searchers are able to recover the plane 's vital black boxes , it matters less which country takes control of them than does " finding out the truth			0
" oceanic salvage manager : how we search for @entity2 the co-pilot 's cell phone meanwhile , a new detail emerged from the flight on monday			1
a @entity159 official told @entity0 that co-pilot @entity2 's cell phone was on and made contact with a cell tower in @entity124 about the time the plane disappeared from radar			2
however , the @entity159 official -- who cited information shared by @entity124 investigators -- said there was no evidence @entity170 had tried to make a call			2
the official told @entity0 's @entity172 on monday that a cell phone tower in @entity174 , @entity124 -- about 250 miles from where the flight 's transponder last sent a signal -- detected the first officer 's phone searching for service roughly 30 minutes after authorities believe the plane made a sharp turn westward			1
the details do appear to reaffirm suggestions , based on radar and satellite data , that the plane was off course and was probably flying low enough to obtain a signal from a cell tower , the @entity159 official said			2
@entity159 officials familiar with the investigation told @entity0 they have been told that no other cell phones were picked up by the @entity174 tower			0
pilots are supposed to turn off their cell phones before pushing back from the gate			0
when the plane first went missing , authorities said millions of cell phone records were searched , looking for evidence that calls had been made from the plane after it took off , but the search turned up nothing			0
the suspected oil slick another possible clue into the plane 's disappearance appeared monday			1
@entity13 officials announced the @entity13 ship @entity213 had detected an oil slick sunday evening			1
it is unclear where the oil came from ; a 2 - liter sample has been collected for examination , and was on its way tuesday to western @entity13 for analysis			0
test results could be days away			0
@entity0 aviation analyst @entity223 , who flies a @entity224 , said the engines on the plane have about 20 quarts of oil each			0
" it could be slowly dripping up to the surface , " he told @entity0 's " @entity230 360			0
" " they 're saying an oil slick			1
i 'm wondering if it 's just some sort of a fluid slick			2
it could be ( from ) hydraulics			0
" if it is oil , it 's not the first oil slick detected as part of the search			1
a similar find in the first days of the search was determined to be fuel oil from a freighter			0
surface search nearing end while air and sea surface searches continued wednesday some 2,087 kilometers ( 1,297 miles ) northwest of @entity12 , those searches are likely nearing an end			0
" the air and surface search for floating material will be completed in the next two to three days in the area where the aircraft most likely entered the water , " retired @entity13 air chief marshal @entity249 , head of the country 's @entity250 , said monday			0
with no debris found after weeks of searches and no possible pings from the plane 's black boxes detected in a week , @entity249 said it was time to focus the search underwater			2
the number of aircraft in the search grew to 14 planes , including three civilian jets			0
there were also 11 ships involved wednesday			0
how do underwater sonar subs work ? what happens after the pingers die ? listening for pings , water plays tricks @entity0 's @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 contributed to this report .			2

new : @entity283 says @entity10 may be able to go deeper ; another vehicle that can awaits its call
underwater probe will map ocean floor until 10 a.m. et wednesday , source says
vehicle 's first attempt ended early after it exceeded its maximum dive depth
meanwhile , investigators are trying to determine significance of cell signal and oil slick
