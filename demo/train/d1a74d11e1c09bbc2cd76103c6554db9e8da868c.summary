-- the @entity2 police are not about to take your vacuum cleaner away from you			1
but monday marks the day that super powerful vacuum cleaners that use more than 1600 @entity8 can no longer be sold in stores in the @entity2 , nor manufactured in @entity2 plants			1
this should be of no shock to anyone			0
the rule - intended to improve energy efficiency - was agreed five years ago and manufacturers have reacted accordingly			1
they may not like it			0
@entity18 for one is looking for a judicial review of the new rule , though it has complied with it			2
@entity25 consumers are used to this			0
new wattage rules have already been in effect for light bulbs , televisions , washing machines and refrigerators			0
but for some reason here in the @entity36 , the vacuum cleaner appears a step too far for the popular press which has noted that the @entity2 is " sucking " consumer rights out of @entity36 , or just that the " @entity40			2
" there are reports of a jump in sales of the more powerful vacuum cleaners over the weekend before the ban took effect			1
" i believe there is a misconception and that is that if you have a high - voltage vac that also means that it has a lot of power to suck the dust , " the @entity2 spokesperson @entity48 told me last week , dismissing endless columns of ink in @entity36 that we will have to vacuum for longer periods , hence use more electricity , to clean our homes			1
vacuum cleaners will also have those little a-g charts on them so we know how much they cost us to run			1
there are also new rules on performance and noise levels			0
outdoor vacs , wet and dry vacs and industrial vacs are exempt from all the new rules			0
but that did not make much news in @entity36			0
not that the @entity2 is stopping there			2
the wattage for vacuums will be lowered to a maximum of 900 @entity79 in 2017			0
the current limit of @entity8 is just a temporary pause on the way to even more energy efficiency			1
next year the @entity2 will start to talk about putting other appliances on the list ; lawn mowers , mobile phones , hair dryers , kettles ( watch out for the @entity36 headlines on that one -- @entity2 blows its @entity92 , @entity93 )			1
@entity94 stresses there is no formal , or informal list and there is no guarantee new rules to lower the wattage on smaller appliances will be adopted			0
but the goal here is greater energy efficiency			1
the @entity2 hopes to meet about a third of its power reduction targets in the coming years simply by reducing energy used by appliances			2
it is finding steps to cut unnecessary power and it sees this as a less painful step on the way to that goal .			0

vacuum cleaners that use more than 1600 @entity8 can no longer be sold in stores in the @entity2
the @entity2 rule is intended to improve energy efficiency
next year the @entity2 will consider other appliances such as mobile phones and hair dryers
