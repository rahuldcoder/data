-- the 2011 @entity2 uprisings presented the @entity3 with a historic opportunity to take a clear stand on the side of freedom and democracy and strengthen its own standing in the process			1
incredibly , the @entity12 administration has blundered and stumbled , with a response marked by timidity and caution			1
as a result , @entity3 appears weaker , less influential and less trusted , while the @entity2 @entity17 continues to seethe with instability and violence			1
today , as the @entity22 state shudders , with millions taking to the streets infuriated with a government that is taking the country down a path they do not trust , and as @entity28 continue to slaughter each other , with death toll approaching 100,000 , there is no side in the conflicts that feels warmly toward @entity3			1
the most astonishing part is that the uprisings across the @entity17 and @entity35 were launched by young , progressive idealists , whose objective was to reshape their countries by overthrowing entrenched dictators and bringing pluralism and democracy			0
the dna of the revolution made it a natural for @entity3 support			2
granted , the uprisings also targeted strong @entity3 allies , such as @entity22 's now - deposed president , @entity48			1
but once the dictator fell , @entity3 should have made a much stronger case for the fundamental principles of liberal democracy			2
it is extraordinary this is happening under @entity12 , the leader who took the dramatic step of traveling to @entity56 just months into his first term and delivering a landmark speech that vowed to end the " cycle of suspicion and discord " between @entity3 and @entity61 , and affirmed his belief that all people " yearn for certain things , " including freedom , democracy , and genuine justice			1
when the people took the reins of history into their own hands , @entity12 's poetry crashed into geopolitical realities , not to mention domestic political considerations			1
the choices , in fairness , were not easy			0
but @entity12 could have done much better			2
coup worsens @entity12 's @entity22 policy headache in @entity22 , the @entity78 , a group with a deeply anti-western , anti-american ideology , won the elections			1
@entity81 was right in trying to work with a government that had been elected by the @entity22 people			2
but it went too far , ignoring the fundamental principles of democracy that @entity3 should have kept at the forefront of the agenda			0
@entity81 had to work with @entity56 -- and hence , with the government of president @entity90 -- but it did n't have to keep as quiet as it did when @entity90 and his supporters started pushing away from democratic principles , undermining freedoms and laying the groundwork for a state that would change the character of the country			0
the @entity100 vision of the @entity78 is deeply offensive to supporters of equality for women , legal protections for minorities , free media , and respect for the views of the opposition			0
instead , in pursuit of stability , the @entity3 held its tongue			1
occasionally , @entity3 officials spoke out , as when the ambassador to @entity22 , @entity115 , told a small group in @entity117 that " democracy needs a healthy and active civil society			1
" but when the government went after that same civil society , arresting and then convicting 43 members of nongovernmental organizations -- including 16 @entity3 -- and sentencing them to prison terms on sham charges , the @entity3 kept its voice low , to the dismay of its friends			0
the @entity12 administration has been so timid , so eager to stay out of the fray , that a few weeks before the verdict against the pro-democracy activists , secretary of state @entity131 passed up the opportunity to take a stand for the workers , and for democracy , by quietly waiving the human rights preconditions of @entity3 aid to @entity22 and thus allowing $ 1.3 billion in aid to go forward			1
there were better ways to play that hand			0
@entity3 threw away its aces			0
in @entity28 , the @entity3 passed up for too long the opportunity to support the most liberal of rebels fighting against the dictator @entity148 , allowing extremist radicals to dominate the opposition			0
now the choices are far more difficult , and @entity3 's standing is in tatters with the people who should have been its natural allies			2
the oversimplified equation says the country has to choose between its ideals and its interests			0
but in the case of the @entity2 uprisings , @entity3 's ideals and interests overlap			1
if @entity81 stood more convincingly with those who share its ideals , it would strengthen them within their revolutions			2
it would help them to victory , and then @entity3 would become stronger , having real friends in power in the post-revolutionary @entity17			0
it 's not too late for a course correction			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			0

@entity182 : the @entity2 uprisings gave the @entity3 a historic chance to side with freedom
@entity187 : incredibly , the @entity12 administration 's response has been marked by timidity
she says in pursuit of stability , the @entity3 held its tongue as @entity22 's leader broke his words
@entity187 : @entity3 should side more with those who share its ideals and help them in revolutions
