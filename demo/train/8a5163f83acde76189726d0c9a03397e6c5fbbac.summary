-- he had a rough life during the @entity3 , walking around with a couple of broken ribs and a possibly cancerous lesion on his jaw before dying at a young age			2
assistant lab supervisor @entity10 discusses the teeth and lower jaw of columbian mammoth fossil " @entity14			1
" now , at least 10,000 years later , visitors in @entity16 can see the remains of " @entity14 , " a columbian mammoth whose nearly intact skeleton is part of what is being described as a key find by paleontologists at @entity16 ' @entity25			1
@entity14 was discovered at a construction site in the heart of @entity16			1
an earth mover helping to build an underground parking garage near the @entity30 uncovered the mammoth 's skull , according to project director @entity33			1
" the skull was hit and shaved off ... by a scraper , " @entity33 told @entity0 thursday			0
" we do n't know just how smashed up it is , but it 's fairly intact because it 's a huge jacket we put it around			1
" the mammoth 's fossil was found along with 16 other deposits at the site that paleontologists " tree - boxed " along with the surrounding dirt , creating 23 massive crates weighing between 5 and 53 tons that were then lifted out intact			1
@entity14 's remains were encased in a plaster jacket			2
the construction was being monitored by a consulting firm because the site is so close to the @entity25 -- a site that has yielded between 3 million and 4 million fossilized bones			1
construction on the parking garage began in 2006 but it took two more years for all the recovered materials to be handed over to researchers at the @entity25 , who began analyzing the various fossils in june , @entity33 said			2
" it 's very exciting for us because each one of these ... could be different ages in the past 10,000 to 45,000 years , " @entity33 said			2
@entity62 , the head curator of the @entity25 , publicly announced the finding of " a whole new treasure trove of fossils " on wednesday			0
he described it as " the most important discovery " for the museum " of the last 90 years			1
" @entity33 said the announcement was made to " create interest " in the museum 's discovery			1
among the most interesting items is likely to be @entity14 , who is believed to have died in his late 40s			0
mammoths are thought to have had an average lifespan of about 60 years			0
not all of @entity14 's remains have been cleaned off and analyzed			2
" right now we have opened the plaster jacket of four sections that were excavated , including vertebrae and ribs and pelvis , one tusk and the lower jaw , " @entity33 said			0
" it will take another six to 12 months to open everything			0
" @entity33 said both of @entity14 's tusks were found intact , which is very rare			1
" previously , we 've found mammoths but the tusk material was very poorly preserved , " @entity33 said			2
" it 's very exciting to us to have these two complete , beautifully preserved tusks			1
" the excitement generated by @entity14 and the rest of the paleontological find could help boost the @entity25 's attendance and funding , which is key as many museums are seeing their attendance dry up during the recession			0
" the cleaning of @entity14 can be viewed inside the museum inside the ' fishbowl ' -- a windowed area -- as parts of his bones are being cleaned , " @entity33 said			1
" so people come to see us and we 've constructed small exhibits			0
it will attract a lot of people and that will help our funding situation			0
" researchers hope to have the entire skeleton on display by next year			0
@entity33 said it is unique to have such a major fossil find in the heart of an urban center like @entity16			1
" i 've always said we 're kind of spoiled here in @entity127 , " he said			2
" it 's not like going to the @entity129 where you ca n't take a shower for weeks			0
" while the process of cleaning and analyzing the fossils is very intricate and time consuming , @entity33 said it is a rare experience for researchers to come in to work and not know what they will discover that day			0
" every day we come to work , we 're uncovering things that have n't seen the light of day for 40,000 years , " he said			0
" it 's an exciting thing that we 're doing just that			0
