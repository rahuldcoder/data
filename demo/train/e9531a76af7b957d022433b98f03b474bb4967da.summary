-- the world 's eco-systems are at risk of " rapid degradation and collapse " according to a new @entity7 report			1
the third @entity8 ( @entity8 - 3 ) published by the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) warns that unless " swift , radical and creative action " is taken " massive further loss is increasingly likely			2
" @entity12 , executive secretary of the @entity9 said in a statement : " the news is not good			2
we continue to lose biodiversity at a rate never before seen in history			2
" the @entity7 warns several eco-systems including the @entity21 rainforest , freshwater lakes and rivers and coral reefs are approaching a " tipping point " which , if reached , may see them never recover			1
the report says that no government has completely met biodiversity targets that were first set out in 2002 -- the year of the first @entity8 report			2
executive director of the @entity33 @entity32 said there were key economic reasons why governments had failed in this task			0
" many economies remain blind to the huge value of the diversity of animals , plants and other life - forms and their role in healthy and functioning eco-systems , " @entity38 said in a statement			1
although many countries are beginning to factor in " natural capital , " @entity38 said that this needs " rapid and sustained scaling - up			0
" despite increases in the size of protected land and coastal areas , biodiversity trends reported in the @entity58 are almost entirely negative			0
vertebrate species fell by nearly one third between 1970 and 2006 , natural habitats are in decline , genetic diversity of crops is falling and sixty breeds of livestock have become extinct since 2000			0
@entity67 , a @entity33 spokesman , said the cost of eco-systems degradation is huge			1
" in terms of land - use change , it 's thought that the annual financial loss of services eco-systems provide -- water , storing carbon and soil stabilization -- is about € 50 billion ( $ 64 billion ) a year , " @entity67 told @entity0			1
" if this continues we may well see by 2050 a cumulative loss of what you might call land - based natural capital of around € 95 trillion ( $ 121 trillion ) , " he said			1
" if we start putting these figures on the table , then governments might actually wake up to this			0
we 've had a financial crisis			0
we 've also got a natural resource scarcity crisis looming fast			0
" the @entity58 is a landmark study in what is the @entity7 's @entity91 and will play a key role in guiding the negotiations between world governments at the @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity97 in october 2010			1
@entity7 secretary general ban ki - moon urged governments to give biodiversity a " higher priority in all areas of decision making and in all economic sectors " and called for a " new vision for biological diversity			1
" the @entity9 -- an international treaty designed to sustain diversity of life on @entity110 -- was set up at the @entity111 in @entity112 in 1992 .			0

eco-systems around the world are experiencing continuing degradation
economic costs of ignoring the worth of biodiversity are huge
@entity7 spokesman estimates cumulative loss by 2050 could be $ 121 trillion
@entity7 secretary general ban ki - moon calls for " new vision for biological diversity "
