but @entity13 voters appear less motivated than other voters			0
about one - third of @entity13 voters say they have given this election " a lot of thought , " while half of @entity17 registered voters say they have , @entity2 said			1
in a further challenge to @entity23 , the nationwide @entity2 poll found that @entity13 registered voters may be more likely to vote than @entity23			2
about 44 percent of @entity26 say they have given the election quite a lot of thought compared with 28 percent of @entity23 , the @entity2 report said			1
" this partisan gap is consistent with survey findings of the full population of registered voters , " said the report by @entity31 , associate director of the @entity2			0
the study finds that while two - thirds of @entity13 voters support the @entity23 , 22 percent back the @entity39 candidate			1
@entity40 overwhelmingly supported the @entity23 in the 2008 presidential election , with @entity42 getting 67 percent of the @entity7 vote and @entity44 garnering 31 percent			1
likewise , the report said , 69 percent of @entity13 voters supported @entity5 candidates in 2006 congressional races while 30 percent supported @entity39 hopefuls			2
" even in 2004 , a year when @entity26 won a greater share of the @entity13 vote in the presidential election than at any time since the 1980s , nearly six in 10 ( 58 percent ) @entity13 voters supported @entity5 @entity53 and @entity54 , " the report said			0
latino support for @entity42 remains strong , the survey found			0
nearly two - thirds of @entity13 registered voters said they approve of his job performance , well above the 47 percent of all @entity17 registered voters who say they approve			1

sixty - two percent of @entity13 registered voters said they identify with or lean toward the @entity5 , @entity2 said , while 25 percent say the same for the @entity39			1

" nearly half ( 47 percent ) of latino registered voters say this about the @entity5 -- down from 55 percent in 2008 , but similar to the share on this question expressed by @entity40 for much of the past decade , " @entity2 said			1
" in contrast , " the report said , " very few see the @entity39 as more concerned about @entity40 than the @entity5 -- just 6 percent of all @entity13 registered voters and 18 percent of @entity13 registered voters say this			1
