but national security adviser @entity23 explained wednesday that a spate of terror - related plots in the @entity20 recently prompted the @entity4 administration to include homegrown terrorism in the document			1
" such a strategy must begin with the recognition that a clear - eyed understanding of our strategic environment -- the world as it is today -- is necessary to shape the world that we seek , " according to a summary of the plan			1
" currently , the @entity20 is focused on completing a responsible transition in @entity38 , succeeding in @entity39 , and defeating @entity40 and its terrorist affiliates , while moving our economy from deep recession to enduring recovery			1
