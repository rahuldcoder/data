-- over 1.8 million gallons of dispersant chemicals have been added to the @entity2 to break up oil flowing from the @entity4 's ruptured well			1
and in the 100 days since the rig 's explosion , little more has become known about the effects of those chemicals			1
in may , the @entity10 @entity9 and @entity11 directed @entity12 to use a less toxic dispersant than the one it was putting into the @entity2 , @entity15			1
when the company did not comply , epa administrator @entity18 announced that the @entity9 would run its own toxicity tests , the first round of which focused on @entity15 and seven other common , readily available dispersants from the agency 's approved list			1
the tests showed @entity15 to be slightly less toxic than the manufacturer 's data had indicated , so no new orders were issued			0
" we need more data before we decide whether to change dispersants , " said @entity28 , the @entity9 's assistant administrator for research and development			1
" our ultimate goal in all of this is to reach a point where dispersants are no longer necessary			2
" scientists say questions remain about the effects of dispersants , in particular the more subtle consequences			1
" the only effect that 's being looked [ in acute toxicity tests ] at is death , lethality			2
that is a place that testing often starts because you want to know what concentration of the chemical will kill fish or other organisms , " said @entity47 , senior scientist at the @entity48			0
" but what 's much more relevant in predicting the full effects of the use of dispersants and dispersed oil are the more subtle effects -- that are sublethal , that may affect growth and reproduction			1
" those sublethal effects may cause a population to diminish without necessarily killing organisms			2
larvae and eggs are most at risk because they are more sensitive and less mobile			0
as for human health , scientists say much more needs to be learned about dispersants -- their behavior with oil , chemical ingredients , chronic and delayed effects -- to understand the risks			1
there are two types of potential exposures for humans , according to scientists : direct ( by inhalation , ingestion or absorption through the skin ) and indirect ( by eating seafood )			2
according to toxicologist dr. @entity93 of @entity94 , the risk to most humans is very low because the oil - dispersant mixture dilutes quickly and does not build up in the food chain			2
some scientists disagree over dispersants ' ability to break down the oil faster than it would naturally decompose			1
" the conventional wisdom is that by breaking up oil into small droplets , it may be more easily biodegraded			2
that is not firmly established			0
in fact , there are conflicting data , " said @entity47			0
" some studies suggest that the rate of degradation of @entity116 [ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , a breakdown product of oil ] is actually impeded by dispersants			1
" another unknown is whether the chemical constituents of oil are more or less likely to persist in the food chain			0
" the problem has been that we have simply not required the answers to those questions			0
the fact that they are being asked now , and we do n't have answers , is of particular concern given the magnitude and scale of use of dispersant			0
" according to @entity47 , more information is needed in order " to be able to intelligently answer questions of whether we should still be using the dispersants			0
" " i am not of the view that [ dispersant ] should or should not be used			0
i do n't think we have enough data to answer those questions very well , and i 'm hoping that this tragedy will spur us to answer those questions so we 'll have enough information next time			0

@entity9 tested toxicity levels of eight common , readily available dispersants
some scientists disagree over dispersants ' ability to break down the oil faster
subtle effects of oil on *marine* life , *environment* still not known
