off @entity0 , @entity1 -- calling all great white sharks in the waters off @entity5 : please report to @entity0 to be measured and tagged by scientists			1
researchers are combing these waters for sharks , with the goal of reeling them in , studying them and fitting them with transmitters -- all in just 15 minutes per shark			1
when @entity2 visited the 126 - foot @entity17 ship at sea this week , the crew had not yet caught a shark despite a week of looking			2
but they hoped that their patience would be rewarded , as it was last summer with two live captures			0
once the scouts find and hook a shark , it is guided to the ship and led into the cradle of a submerged " sharklift			1
" the fish is not sedated , so the wranglers have to be careful to avoid being slashed by its sharp teeth or struck by its powerful tail			2
the goal of such adrenalin - stoking captures : to gather data to better understand what sharks do , where they go and how they live			1
" up until now , the only big sharks i 've been able to examine up close and personal have been dead , " said scientific leader @entity40 of the @entity41			2
" this vessel allows you to take it to the next level : bring big fish on board and do multiple studies on live fish			2
" not a toy : @entity52 found on @entity54 subway car @entity17 fishing master @entity56 's job is to jump into the water and guide the shark into position			1
he said the fish do n't usually thrash around or try to bite him , but it 's clear from videos of past captures that the giant predators can still be active and unpredictable			1
when he 's bringing a shark in , @entity65 said , he is not focused on fear but on keeping his distance , monitoring the health of the fish and getting the work done quickly			1
" i 'm not a thrill - seeker kind of person , " @entity65 said			0
" this has been my whole life , being around animals like this and being in the ocean			0
" @entity78 special : best places to swim with sharks he puts two gushing hoses into the mouth of the fish to keep a crucial flow of water over the gills			1
then he puts a heavy towel over its eyes to help calm it down			0
another worker holds a line looped around the tail , which serves as an early warning system in case the fish is about to whip its tail			2
once the 75,000 - pound custom sharklift scoops the fish out of the water , the scientific team goes to work			1
they take blood , tissue and fin samples			2
they take an ultrasound if the fish is female in hopes of finding a pregnancy			2
they also record any parasites or contaminants the shark may carry			2
the workers also attach several transponders to measure and transmit tracking data such as the shark 's location , depth , and how it swims			1
some transponders are attached by drilling holes in the dorsal fin ; others are surgically embedded in the abdomen			0
then the fish is set free			0
the transmitted data is posted on the @entity17 global shark tracker website , which displays the current location of each shark			1
for example , it shows that " @entity134 , " a shark the researchers tagged off @entity5 last year , has since been up and down the coast , from @entity139 to @entity140 and @entity141 ; it even made a quick trip to @entity143			1
@entity144 defends dramatized shark special ' megalodon ' @entity40 says he is fascinated by everything about sharks : their sleek shape , their effortless swimming , their strength , and of course , their powerful jaws and famously sharp teeth , serrated to cut into big animals such as seals			1
hundreds of seals gather in @entity0 harbor and on the @entity5 shoreline , barking and snuffling , harrumphing across the sand , and their whiskered faces pop out of the surf			0
it is their plentiful numbers that draw the great white sharks to this coastline , which also draws many beachgoers			0
@entity40 says the purpose of all this scientific work is both to improve public safety and conservation			1
@entity17 -- whose mission is to study and preserve marine life , especially sharks -- says that in areas like @entity5 , where shark sightings often force beaches to close during the height of summer , beach managers could use the tracking data to understand how sharks move and make beaches safer			1
expedition leader @entity185 says that when it comes to the threat sharks pose to humans , their reputation is worse than the reality			0
" these animals are very skittish , very nervous and do n't want to really be around people at all , " he said			0
experts note that while sharks might kill a half dozen people per year , people kill tens of millions of sharks			0
when it comes to conservation , the @entity17 scientists hope that their data about the travels and behavior of a threatened animal could help inform decisions about managing and protecting it			1
@entity40 says great white sharks are an extraordinary and irreplaceable animal			0
" @entity52 are a critical component			0
they 're the top predators			0
if you remove those top predators , then something on which they feed may come out of balance , " he said			0
" you get this cascade of effects that ultimately causes real problems - not only for the ocean , but also really for man			0

shark researchers seek to *temporarily* capture the fish off @entity1 to collect data
hooked sharks are guided into a " sharklift , " where scientists take samples , attach transponders
the sharks ' movements are monitored on *non-profit* 's website
the information can be used to improve public safety , protect sharks , researchers say
