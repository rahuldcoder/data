@entity9 president @entity8 poses for a photograph last month in @entity11			2
( @entity12 ) -- before disappearing from public life in 2006 and officially stepping down as @entity9 's president tuesday , @entity8 ruled the country with an iron fist , despite numerous attempts by his enemies to do away with him			2
the @entity20 - directed april 1961 invasion of @entity9 at the @entity21 was just the tip of the iceberg when it came to @entity6 government efforts to rid @entity9 of @entity8			1
they began with his rise to power in 1959 and continued through the mid- 1960s			0
in many cases , those efforts were accompanied by assassination plots , ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime			0
some were serious , others were not			0
most @entity6 did not learn of these efforts until 1975 , when sen. @entity36 of @entity37 conducted hearings on @entity39			0
greater detail became available in 1993 with the declassification of the @entity42 to assassinate @entity8 , a report ordered by president @entity44			2
it was prepared in 1967 by the @entity20 's inspector general and made available to the @entity47 but not declassified until 36 years later			0
watch a report on the impact of @entity8 's resignation Â» the @entity47 concluded there were " at least eight plots involving the @entity20 to assassinate @entity8 from 1960 to 1965			2
" some , however , never got beyond the talking stage , as indicated by the @entity20 inspector general 's report			0
they included , before august 1960 , plots aimed only at discrediting @entity8			1
aerosol attack on radio station discussion was held on a scheme to contaminate the air of the radio station in @entity11 where @entity8 broadcast his speeches with a chemical that produces reactions similar to @entity66			1
nothing came of the idea			0
contaminated cigars a vague scheme involving a box of cigars treated with a chemical intended to produce temporary personality disorientation or , perhaps , cause his beard to fall out			1
the source was the late @entity78 , the @entity20 's project director for what became the @entity21			0
while vague on his recollections about the intended effect of the cigars , @entity78 said he was positive they were not lethal			0
depilatory a scheme involving thallium salt , a chemical used by women as a depilatory , placed in his shoes			2
the idea was to cause @entity8 's beard to fall out , thus damaging his image			1
gambling syndicate -- @entity95 ( august 1960 - may 1961 ) a complicated assassination plot initiated by @entity97 , involving @entity98 figures @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , who had contacts remaining in @entity11 from @entity103 days			1
it was timed to coincide with the @entity105 , although @entity97 , head of @entity20 covert operations at the time , never bothered to tell either @entity107 , the @entity21 project director , nor @entity110 col. @entity109 , the project 's paramilitary officer			0
poison pills were to be delivered to @entity11 and delivered to a contact inside a restaurant frequented by @entity8			1
no one knows if the pills ever got to @entity11			2
it was called off after the @entity21			0
gambling syndicate -- @entity122 ( late 1961 - june 1963 ) the same plot involving @entity98 figures and poison pills was reactivated in early 1962 as part of the period of @entity125 , the @entity127 program to unseat @entity8			1
the pills were given to @entity129 , a prominent @entity9 exile , through @entity101 , another @entity98 figure			1
@entity129 then asked for arms and ammunition as well , which were passed to him by the @entity136 @entity20 station			0
the inspector general 's report indicates uncertainty as to whether the pills ever made it to @entity9			0
schemes in early 1963 skin - diving suit this plot was hatched at the time @entity147 attorney @entity146 was negotiating with @entity8 for the release of the @entity21 prisoners			1
it called for @entity146 to present @entity8 with a skin - diving suit dusted inside with a fungus that would produce a disabling and chronic skin disease and contaminating the breathing apparatus with the bacterium that causes tuberculosis			1
the skin - diving suit already had been bought but was abandoned when it was learned @entity146 already had given @entity8 a skin - diving suit on his own initiative			1
booby - trapped seashell the idea was to take an unusually spectacular seashell that would catch @entity8 's attention , load it with an explosive triggered to blow when the seashell was lifted , and submerge it in an area @entity8 was known to frequent for skin - diving			1
the plan progressed so far that @entity170 , then head of the @entity20 's @entity9 operations , bought two books on @entity174 mollusks			0
it was later decided the scheme was impracticable for a variety of reasons , among them that a midget submarine to have been used in placing the seashell had too short an operating range			2
@entity184 - @entity183 , whose code name was @entity186 , was a member of @entity8 's inner circle from the beginning			1
he had become disenchanted and made contact with the @entity20 as early as 1961			0
@entity190 , his @entity20 case officer , was meeting with @entity183 in @entity191 when president @entity192 was killed in @entity193 , @entity194 , november 22 , 1963			0
@entity190 provided @entity183 that day -- at @entity183 's request -- a poison pen - syringe to be used either on @entity8 or on himself , in case of a failed attempt			1
as @entity20 covert operations against @entity8 began winding down , the @entity200 put @entity183 in touch with @entity203 , the exiled chief of a 300 - member , @entity20 - funded exile guerrilla army operating for @entity206			1
the joint @entity208 - @entity183 plan was for @entity183 to assassinate @entity8 when he gave his annual july 26 , 1965 , speech at @entity210 , a beach resort on @entity9 's north coast			1
the assassination would coincide with a seaborne invasion by @entity208 's forces with the presumed support of several @entity9 army officers in the area			0
the operation was canceled in late june 1965 after it became compromised			0

a plot to *embarrass* @entity8 suggested chemicals to cause his beard to fall out
one plan included @entity98 figures and poison pills
a booby - trapped seashell that would explode when lifted was also discussed
one scheme included a diving suit dusted inside with a disease - causing fungus
