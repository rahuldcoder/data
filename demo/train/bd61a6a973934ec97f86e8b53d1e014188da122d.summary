@entity0 -- the battle continued monday to plug a crack at @entity7 's @entity6 nuclear power facility that 's been a conduit for highly radioactive water leaking into the @entity10 , utility company officials said			1
on sunday , the workers poured a chemical compound mixed with sawdust and newspaper into the crack , hoping it would expand and stick			0
but so far it has not done the trick , according to officials with the @entity19 , which operates the plant			1
the effort followed an attempt saturday to use concrete to plug the the 2 - meter - deep ( 6.5 - foot - deep ) , concrete - lined basin , where authorities had found water gushing directly into the sea via a roughly 20 - centimeter ( 8 - inch ) crack			1
the cracked shaft sits behind the no. 2 reactor 's turbine building at the facility , which has been in constant crisis since the failure of cooling systems and numerous explosions in the wake of last month 's epic earthquake and tsunami			1
fixing the problem quickly is critical because officials believe it is one source of alarmingly high levels of radiation spotted in seawater near the plant			1
this is all part of a massive , many weekslong effort to contain the amount of toxic material leaking into the air , ground and water			2
on monday , a @entity19 spokesman said the idea of wrapping some or all of the plant 's six reactors containment buildings in massive amounts of sheeting , in order to curb the release of radiation had been discussed in recent talks with government officials			1
the utility company is considering the concept , according to the spokesman			0
in the meantime , authorities are still trying to determine how harmful the radiation levels are currently around the plant			2
after some high - profile errors while offering regular radiation measurements on seawater , groundwater and the air , little such new information has been released since thursday			2
one part of the problem , including in the concrete shaft from which the highly radioactive water is leaking directly into the sea , is the fact that dosimeters being used do n't go higher than 1,000 millisieverts per hour , @entity0 electric executive @entity77 told reporters sunday			1
authorities know the water is emitting at least that much radiation , which alone is more than 330 times the dose an average resident of an industrialized country naturally receives in a year			2
above the shaft , the level was 250 millisieverts per hour			0
the shaft lies at the end of a long channel that has been filling up for days			2
last thursday , samples of seawater taken 330 meters ( 361 yards ) offshore were said to have levels of iodine - 131 at 4,385 times above the standard and cesium - 137 at 527 times beyond normal			0
experts say the latter radioactive isotope may be a greater concern because it persists longer , taking 30 years to lose half its radiation -- compared to an eight - day half - life for the iodine - 131 isotope			2
plugging the external leak is job one , in order to prevent the outflow of radiation into the @entity10			2
but it may not be the most difficult , or important , task ahead			0
authorities still have to figure out how the tainted water got into the concrete shaft in the first place			2
the water had to come from somewhere , potentially traveling across melted - down nuclear fuel in the reactor 's core before somehow reaching the outside			1
@entity125 , an official with @entity7 's nuclear and industrial safety agency , said sunday that the working theory is that water injected in recent weeks into the no. 2 reactor to help cool its nuclear fuel rods somehow got out			1
" we were assuming and hoping ( that water ) would stay in the containment vessel as vapor after being cooled , " he said			2
" however , it may have flowed into the building , and then the trench			0
" finding out why and how that happened -- and , more so , what to do about it -- promises to be " exceptionally challenging , " said physicist @entity142 , with the @entity144 - based @entity143 think tank			0
to do so , officials must inspect a complicated array of pipes inside the dangerous radioactive environment that now exists within the containment building , according to @entity142			0
he is familiar with @entity7 nuclear plants in part from having examined one rocked by a 6.8 - magnitude earthquake in 2007			1
this struggle is part of the larger , daunting challenge facing @entity19 and @entity7 officials as they come to grips with the scope of the disaster and work feverishly to keep nuclear fuel cool and prevent the further release of dangerously radioactive material			1
general electric chief executive @entity165 , who also chairs @entity168 president @entity167 's @entity166 , was in @entity0 on sunday meeting with @entity19 officials			1
several of the @entity6 plant 's reactors were designed by @entity174 and built in a joint venture with @entity176			1
@entity77 , the @entity19 executive , said @entity165 and the utility 's officials discussed the crisis and how to meet summer 's peak demands with two of its nuclear plants offline : the @entity6 facility and the @entity186 nuclear plant , which is in the same prefecture			1
a power company official announced sunday that two workers missing since the 9.0 - magnitude march 11 quake were found dead in the basement of the no. 4 reactor 's turbine building			0
both men , ages 21 and 24 , appeared to have suffered multiple traumatic injuries			0
their remains were found wednesday			0
more than a dozen others have been reported injured over the past three weeks at the plant			0
most of their injuries were tied to explosions caused by the buildup of hydrogen in the @entity206 1 and 3 reactor complexes			0
@entity125 said there is a plan to inject nonflammable nitrogen into the @entity206 1 , 2 and 3 reactors to prevent another such hydrogen blast			0
a buildup of hydrogen is an early sign of damage to a reactor 's superheated core			0
but @entity125 said no alarms had been sounded about rising pressure and that adding nitrogen would not force engineers to release hydrogen from the reactors			0
all these difficulties notwithstanding , there has been good news recently on the nuclear front			0
figures released this weekend by @entity7 's health and science ministries showed levels of radioactive iodine and cesium in vegetables tested in @entity6 and @entity235 prefectures had fallen below legal limits			1
still , there was no immediate indication that officials would lift restrictions on the sale and distribution of certain products from areas near the stricken plant , put in place after tests detected high radiation levels in some food			2
also , a study done late last month on 946 children up to age 15 in several communities near the @entity6 plant showed no evidence that they had ingested excessively high levels of radioactive iodine that 's been pinpointed as a cause of thyroid cancer , chief cabinet secretary @entity251 said sunday			1
the @entity7 minister also took pains to stress the crisis is n't over yet -- either at the power plant or within a 30 - kilometer ( 18 - mile ) radius , where 78,000 people have been ordered to evacuate and another 62,000 told to at least stay indoors			1
" the impact of the nuclear crisis is expected to go on for a long time , " he said			1
" ( the evacuees , especially ) are enduring an extremely difficult situation			0
" @entity1 's @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 and @entity276 contributed to this report			0

new : @entity19 may wrap nuclear plant buildings in sheeting to curb radiation
the *2nd* try to plug a leak where radioactive water is entering the sea has n't succeeded
@entity174 's chairman holds talks in @entity0 about the plant , which the @entity168 firm partly designed
@entity7 minister : " the nuclear crisis is expected to go on for a long time "
