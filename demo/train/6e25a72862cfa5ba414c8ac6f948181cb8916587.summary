-- the defense team for @entity2 -- charged with murder in 17 - year - old @entity5 's death -- continued their offensive friday , pressing in court for access to information they hope will shed light on what happened and exonerate the @entity14 man			1
in an interview thursday with " @entity23 's " @entity16 , @entity2 's lawyer @entity17 previewed the court action and reiterated the position that @entity5 , and not his client , was the aggressor in the february 26 incident			1
" we will have a ... trial , and if that trial is fair , he 's going to be acquitted , " @entity17 said , ruling out a deal in which his client pleads guilty to lesser charges			0
while driving through his @entity31 , @entity14 , neighborhood that winter night , @entity2 spotted @entity5 , whom he described on a 911 call as " suspicious			1
" a dispatcher told the 28 - year - old neighborhood watch volunteer not to follow @entity5 , but he did anyway			1
after an altercation , the unarmed @entity38 - @entity37 teenager was shot dead			2
weeks after the incident , the case drew national media attention , and activists demanded an arrest			0
on april 11 , @entity2 was charged with second - degree murder			1
defense lawyers have steadfastly maintained their client 's innocence , saying @entity2 was badly beaten and acted in self - defense			1
they have challenged key pieces of the prosecution 's case			0
one of the most potentially pivotal pieces deals with a 911 call from that night in which someone can be heard screaming for help			0
the thinking is that the person pleading for assistance -- whether it was @entity5 or @entity2 -- was on the defensive , and the other was the aggressor			1
a defense motion filed monday in @entity66 court , which the prosecution replied to friday , asks that @entity2 's lawyers be allowed to question for a second time @entity31 police investigator @entity70			1
@entity2 's lawyers claim that @entity70 overheard the late teen 's father say the screaming voice was not that of his son			1
the father , @entity75 , has said he is " positive " the pleading voice is that of @entity5			1
in a response friday , assistant state 's attorney @entity77 criticized the defense 's arguments and said @entity70 " never mentioned anything about overhearing @entity75 talk about the voice			2
" but the lead prosecutor did n't object to @entity17 and other lawyers deposing @entity70			0
additionally , @entity2 's defense team filed several new documents friday			2
one asks that the prosecution " disclose all witnesses known to the state who claim to be familiar with @entity5 's or @entity2 's voice that have heard " the 911 call			1
@entity2 sues @entity93 over edited 911 call another motion asks the court to force @entity97 , the @entity5 family 's attorney , to turn over the original recording and recording device that he used to first interview the late teenager 's girlfriend			1
asserting that the young woman can prove @entity5 was killed " in cold blood , " @entity97 said in march that the girlfriend " completely blows @entity2 's absurd self - defense claim out of the water			1
" but defense lawyer @entity108 said thursday that the recordings he 's aware of are a " copy of a copy that 's disjointed and chopped and obvious that it was edited			0
" on friday , @entity97 said he has already turned over the tape			0
" the phone records speak for themselves , " the lawyer said			0
" she tells him to run			0
and then , when you go through the 911 tape , @entity2 admits that he is pursuing @entity5			1
" @entity2 filed a different motion friday , asking that he be allowed to remove his gps monitor and leave @entity66 without the court 's permission			2
the document alleges that @entity2 and his wife have lived " in fear of violence at the hands of those who would wish ( him ) harm based on their misinterpretation of the events			2
" these and other court filings friday follow other moves by @entity2 's team in recent days to raise questions in court and in public about the prosecution 's case			2
the next hearing in the case is set for december 11			0
last week , they released a photo of a bloodied @entity2 taken a few minutes after @entity5 was shot dead			1
on thursday , they filed a lawsuit against @entity93 for a report that @entity17 claims portrays his client as a racist and murderer ; the lawyer called it " one shining example of what was done wrong to @entity2			2
" " they took an event and made it highly inflammatory , " said @entity17 of the @entity93 report that , according to the lawsuit , selectively edits audio of @entity2 's 911 call to make him sound racist			2
" they wanted to be first , and ... they wanted to have the most sensational headline of that day			0
and they just did it			0
they just presumed , i think , ... they had a racist			0
" @entity2 , who is @entity170 , is accused of fatally shooting @entity5 , who was african - american			1
@entity93 disputed the accusations and issued a statement saying : " there was no intent to portray mr. @entity2 unfairly			0
we intend to vigorously defend our position in court			0
" @entity0 's @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			0
