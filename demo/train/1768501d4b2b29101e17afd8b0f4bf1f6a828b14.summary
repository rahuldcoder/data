-- coastal areas that ban fishing can provide havens for endangered wildlife , according to a new report			0
findings from a research project conducted over 21 years and published in the " @entity8 " revealed that a marine sanctuary off the coast of @entity12 , @entity9 has significantly improved the survival of @entity15 's dolphins			1
they are one of the rarest species of dolphins , endemic to the waters around @entity9 , with only around 8,000 animals thought to be left in the wild			1
@entity22 ( @entity22 ) have long been advocated as a way to protect sea mammals , but the @entity9 project is the first to confirm this			2
" this study provides the first empirical evidence that @entity22 are effective in protecting threatened marine mammals , " said @entity27 of the @entity28			0
since the @entity22 was designated , the dolphin 's survival has increased by 5.4 % , according to the report			2
covering 1,170 km2 of sea off @entity9 's @entity36 , @entity37 was designated in 1988 to prevent the dolphins being killed by gillnet and trawl fisheries			1
between 1986 and 2006 , researchers conducted regular photo - identification surveys of @entity15 's dolphins , photographing 462 individual animals whose survival they studied			1
" we can identify individual dolphins from their battle scars -- which range from small nicks out of the dorsal fin , to major scarring following shark attacks , " said @entity27 " estimating population changes in marine mammals is challenging , often requiring many years of research to produce data accurate enough to detect these kinds of biological changes			2
" the study also shows that to be effective , mpas need to be sufficiently large			0
" the take home message is that size matters			0
@entity22 work , but they have to be large enough in order to be effective , " said @entity27 .			0
