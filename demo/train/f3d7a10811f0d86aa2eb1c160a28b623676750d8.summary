-- if you 've seen a @entity4 or @entity5 commercial recently , or watched the movie " @entity6 , " chances are , you 've heard @entity8			1
it 's the band whose dreamy , shoegaze - y , ' 80s - inspired music seems to be suddenly everywhere			1
" it 's hard for me to believe it 's real , " said @entity13 , the synth - pop mastermind behind @entity8			1
" i 've been doing this for a long time now , and this is the first time i feel like something is happening			2
" it feels amazing , but it 's also very scary , because i 'm not used to that , " he added			1
" i 'm not used to doing interviews and talking to that many people and feeling that important to people			2
it 's very frightening , but i 'm not going to complain			1
" even though @entity8 has been around for more than a decade , their sixth and most recent album , " @entity29 , " has just now put them on the front lines of success			1
the album debuted at no. 15 on the @entity32 and no. 1 on both the @entity34 and @entity35			0
the first single , " @entity40 , " has gotten more than 11 million views on @entity37 and has gone gold , with more than 500,000 downloads			0
the band has toured @entity42 and @entity43 and has appeared on " @entity44 with @entity45 " and " @entity46 with @entity47			1
" @entity13 was born in southern @entity48 and lived there for 29 years			0
he then moved to @entity49 , where he started the musical adventure that became his latest album			0
" i needed a change			0
i needed to put myself in danger always and try something different , " @entity13 said of his move to the @entity54			0
the band 's sound is a difficult to describe			1
the first time fans listen to @entity8 , a few descriptions may come to mind : " ethereal , " " cinematic , " even " galactic			1
" fitting descriptions , as the band 's name comes from a distant galaxy , @entity66			1
" i was obsessed and very fascinated by stars and astronomy when i was a kid , " @entity13 said			0
besides galactic entities , @entity13 is also inspired by his youth			0
in songs like " @entity72 " and albums like " @entity74 , " @entity8 often incorporates ideas of childhood into its work			1
" remembering my teenage years and my childhood is a very positive feeling			0
it helps me to go through my fears and my insecurities			0
so it 's almost like a therapy , " @entity13 said			2
@entity13 was born in 1980 , so being inspired by his childhood also means he 's enthralled by the music of the ' 80s			2
in fact , he believes that the decade was the single most important musical period of all time : " in the ' 80s , it was like , so many good albums , so many good songs , and the way musicians were experimenting with new instruments , new technologies was truly amazing			1
i do n't think my sound could ever go away from the ' 80s			0
" experimenting is something @entity8 is very familiar with			1
on " @entity29 , " listerners hear brass sections , a children 's choir , a collaboration with singer - songwriter @entity108 , towering synth melodies and even a child talking about frogs			2
" i wanted it to be an ambitious album , something very produced , something i could remember until the end of my days , " @entity13 said			0
and yet , with all that experimenting , the theme of the album goes back to @entity13 ' childhood obsession : space			0
" this album is about dreams but this album is also about what 's out there and we 're probably not the only species in the galaxy , " @entity13 said			1
" there 's probably something else			2
i hope that one day i 'll be the witness of a cool thing			0
" throughout all the acclaim and spotlight this new album has brought on @entity8 , @entity13 focused on his fans : " i want them to be happy			1
i need them to be happy			0
... if the crowd is happy and responds to the music , then it 's a whole different game and becomes the most incredible experience of your life			2
" the group is planning a @entity144 tour this fall .			0
