@entity14 , @entity15 : it 's friday -- awesome ! -- and i 'm @entity18			1
first up today , a headline that some people have waited 15 years to hear			1
first up : @entity21 @entity22 : @entity21 , the former commander of @entity24 forces in @entity4 , has been arrested			1
this conflict in @entity4 happened back in the 1990s			1
it was the deadliest war fought in @entity28 since @entity30 ii. and @entity21 was the highest ranking war crimes suspect who had n't been caught			1
@entity4 was part of the former country of @entity35			1
the war there lasted from 1992 to 1995			1
@entity24 , @entity38 and @entity39 fought against each other for control of territory			1

@entity21 was a @entity47 general during the @entity74 wars of the 1990s , and the highest - ranking @entity35 war crimes suspect still at large			1
he 's wanted for genocide , extermination and murder , and is accused of masterminding the 1995 massacre at @entity50			2
@entity81 @entity80 , @entity82 to @entity83 : general @entity21 has a very heavy responsibility for what was a tragedy in @entity4 for many years , but particularly for the massacre of over 8,000 @entity39 males , which has already been judged to be a genocide			2
@entity90 : the capture was praised internationally as a victory for the rule of law in @entity24			1
@entity94 , @entity95 secretary general : the arrest of @entity21 is a very important step towards full integration of the entire region in our @entity102 - @entity101 community			1
@entity90 : @entity21 now faces extradition to the @entity105 and will eventually be tried by an international criminal tribunal			1
@entity107 , @entity109 assistant secretary of state : when i was the @entity112 spokesman back in the late ' 90s , journalists every day would often ask what 's happening with @entity21 , what 's happening with @entity115 , and all i could say at the time was his day will come			2
and his day has finally come			2
@entity117 : i expect to see him in the @entity118 very soon , and i think that justice will then be done			2
@entity90 : @entity53 , reporting			2
( @entity121 ) @entity122 @entity123 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to ms. @entity126 's social studies classes at @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 ! @entity130 is the president of what country ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity135 , b ) @entity5 , c ) @entity136 or @entity137 ) @entity138 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! mr. @entity130 has been the president of @entity5 for four years			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity144 in @entity5 @entity22 : right now , president @entity130 is welcoming other world leaders as @entity5 hosts the annual meeting of the @entity144 , or @entity147			1
along with @entity5 , the @entity144 includes the @entity109 , @entity148 , @entity136 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity135			1
these are the world 's biggest economic powers			1
they meet every year to discuss major issues happening around the globe			1
the group got together yesterday in @entity5			1
and in addition to big topics -- like the global economy , the environment , terrorism -- the recent @entity149 earthquake and tsunami also came up			1
@entity149 's prime minister thanked president @entity166 for @entity168 's help in recovering from that disaster			2
@entity170 @entity22 : the @entity109 @entity171 is ruling on whether state or federal laws take priority when it comes to immigration reform			2
a majority of the court ruled in favor of an @entity181 law			2
it punishes businesses that do n't use a federal system to check a potential employee 's immigration status			1
other groups had argued that the system is supposed to be voluntary			2
there are several cases involving this " state versus federal " question , so we could hear more on this very soon			2
why so many tornadoes ? @entity22 : officials in @entity7 have released a list of more than 230 people missing since a tornado hit the city of @entity6 on sunday			1
they 're asking anyone with information to call in and help			2
the tornado in @entity6 was just one of the storms that has torn across the @entity109 @entity207 is here to explain the science behind how these twisters form			2
@entity207 ? @entity210 , @entity211 : the set - up across the @entity109 is different from any other place in the world , where you have cold @entity136 air that comes down from , obviously @entity136			1
and this time of year in may and april , we still have cold air at the upper levels of the atmosphere , because it 's not quite totally warmed up			2
and we have warm humid air coming in from the south , and then also dry air coming in from @entity224			2
it makes this year a little bit different			2
at least earlier on , we have this @entity226 that we 've talked about , and what that does it really starts to kink up the jet stream a little bit more than usual , and that gives it more energy			0
that allows more cold air to drop down , and that allows the battleground to light up a little bit more			0
@entity237 @entity22 : on our blog at @entity240 , you 'll see a list of this school year 's top stories			1
severe weather is definitely one of them			0
we want to include your thoughts in our year - end wrap - up			0
go to the blog , leave your comments on these stories			1
you might see them in our show next friday			0
do n't @entity253 @entity22 : today , obviously , is friday			1
but some organizations have dubbed today " do n't @entity253			1
" hmm ? @entity255 is going to shine a light on what this is about			0
( begin video ) @entity260 , @entity0 anchor : the @entity262 , also known as " do n't @entity253 , " is a campaign by the @entity264 and members of the @entity266 on @entity267			1
now in its third year , do n't @entity268 is aimed at educating the public about skin protection in the sun. it 's held just before @entity273 weekend			1
@entity274 , @entity264 : our hope in holding it on the friday before @entity273 really has been to peg to the expectation in most @entity168 families that that is the gateway to summer			0
as of now , 1 in 5 @entity168 is expected to be diagnosed with skin cancer over a lifetime			0
so , @entity264 and the @entity266 are asking folks to remember to slip , slop , slap and wrap			0
first , slip on some protective clothing			0
next , slap on a hat			0
finally , wrap on some sunglasses			0
@entity288 : @entity289 says sunscreen is key			0
@entity291 , @entity292 : the first thing they ought to look for is a large number			0
we really believe that 30 or higher is very important			0
the second thing is that they need to have a broad spectrum , that is @entity300 and uvb coverage			0
( @entity121 ) is this legit ? @entity123 , @entity15 : is this legit ? @entity273 used to be known as @entity273			0
this is true ! and the holiday always falls on the last monday in may			0
honoring the @entity304 @entity22 : the holiday that @entity168 observe on monday goes back almost 150 years			0
it was named @entity273 because the first people who observed it would decorate -- put flowers -- on the graves of troops killed in the @entity312			0
so why late may ? well , it 's believed this time of year was chosen because flowers are in bloom all across the nation			0
it 's where the first major @entity273 observance was held in 1868 , though smaller observances were made throughout the country before that			0
instead of flowers , today 's military usually places small @entity168 flags beside more than 250,000 graves at @entity319			0
the flags will stay there through @entity273			0
but @entity273 , @entity273 , how did we get from one name to the other ? @entity336 , the war to end all wars ; what 's known today as @entity336 it not only changed the world , it changed how the @entity109 remembers its fallen troops			1
after this brutal event , @entity273 became @entity273 to memorialize @entity168 killed in any of the nation 's wars			0
this is what distinguishes this holiday from @entity347 , which honors anyone who 's served in the @entity350			0
and while @entity273 's traditions have changed over the years , its significance remains			0
at 3:00 p.m. , wherever you are on @entity273 , there 's a @entity356			0
it encourages you to pause for one minute in honor of those who 've died fighting for the country			0
before we go @entity22 : well , before we go today , we have proof for you that one person really can make a difference			0
the flag flying over the pier in @entity367 , @entity368 was pretty torn up			0
so , @entity369 decided to do something about it			0
he wrote a letter to the mayor			0
the eight - year - old said that flying a torn flag was disrespectful to the country and its troops			0
he asked the mayor to replace it			0
done ! new flag flying , all thanks to one person 's determination			0
goodbye @entity22 : time for us to wave goodbye			0
no show on monday due to @entity273			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity18 .			1
