-- tobacco has been ingrained in our society since our nation 's earliest days			2
but if cigarettes were introduced today , they 'd most likely never be approved for market			1
for an example of changing attitudes , just friday , a @entity9 jury handed @entity12 $ 23.6 billion in damages in a lawsuit filed by the widow of @entity16 , a smoker who died at the young age of 36 from lung cancer , leaving her to raise their two children -- an award that will , of course , be appealed			1
so the announcement of a merger between @entity25 's second - and third - largest tobacco companies , @entity12 and @entity26 , feels like a lost episode of " @entity28			1
" what other industry is permitted to sell a product that , if used as intended , kills half of its consumers ? that 's not only a dysfunctional public health policy ; it 's the worst business strategy ever			1
imagine the immediate recalls if any other product killed half its customers			1
what if each @entity41 search or @entity43 post took a day off your life ? of course , tobacco has an ingredient that no other consumer product has : nicotine , a substance as addictive as heroin			1
it 's a sure - fire recipe for consumer loyalty to a deadly product , used by companies that have been determined by the federal courts to be liars and racketeers , guilty of putting profits ahead of public health			1
about 70 % of smokers want to quit , but many find it very difficult			0
this year , we learned another reason why			0
the @entity67 released data showing that between 1999 and 2011 , levels of inhaled nicotine in cigarettes had gradually increased by 15 %			0
quitting is a herculean task , even for the most motivated			0
yet there is some positive news			0
despite the nicotine manipulation and the nearly $ 9 billion that @entity78 spends each year marketing its deadly products , smoking rates have declined dramatically over the past several decades			0
today , youth smoking prevalence is below 10 % , and adult smoking rates are at 18 %			0
clean indoor air initiatives , increased excise taxes and bold anti-tobacco public education campaigns like @entity85 , the @entity87 's the @entity86 and the @entity89 's tips from former smokers are formidable weapons against the ever - evolving strategies of the tobacco companies			1
if stronger standards were adopted , like a ban on menthol or a reduction in nicotine levels in cigarettes , then public health officials could help consumers even more			0
with the @entity25 cigarette market in decline , it should n't come as a surprise that these companies want to join forces			1
both have business models that depend on securing " replacement smokers " -- a term coined by @entity12 -- for the 480,000 who die each year from the effects of smoking tobacco in the @entity25 alone			1
sadly , every day , about 2,100 young people who have been occasional smokers progress to become daily smokers , easily filling the consumer pipeline so vital to meet and exceed their bottom lines			0
@entity12 and @entity26 produce @entity119 and @entity120 , two of the top cigarette brands young people most often buy			2
by reducing competition , cutting costs and brainstorming for new strategies , the merger will no doubt try to find new users to make loads of money domestically and worldwide			2
of course , there is an alternative -- though highly unlikely -- ending to this story			0
merging two tobacco giants and consolidating their research , development , marketing and financial power could be used to invent technologies that bring an end to the burned tobacco horror story of the past century			2
while the jury is still out on the peril or promise of e-cigarettes , would n't it be wonderful if this merger became an opportunity to push reset ? should n't the tobacco industry be challenged to introduce products to the marketplace that provide consumer pleasure without the unbearable pain of lung cancer , prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer and heart disease ? if that could become a reality , we might finally put combustible tobacco -- packed with all its lethal tar and carcinogens -- in the history books for good			1
unless this scenario happens , let 's not kid ourselves			0
these companies are jockeying to meet their financial targets , satisfy their shareholders and sell as much deadly tobacco to @entity25 as they possibly can			2
until they truly turn over a new leaf , nearly half a million @entity25 lives will continue to go up in smoke each year .			0

@entity176 : if cigarettes were introduced today , they 'd never be approved for market
@entity176 : attitudes are changing ; @entity12 lost lawsuit filed by widow of lung cancer *victim*
@entity176 : now , two giant tobacco companies are merging , which seems like a *throwback*
she says merger could be opportunity to create product that does n't kill half its users
