-- " @entity1 " holds fast to the pirate code with great humor and animation , appeal for all ages and massive replayability after the main story mode is complete			1
the latest @entity9 video game ( @entity10 , @entity11 ) recounts the first three movies in the popular series and also includes the yet - to - be - released fourth film , " @entity1 : on @entity15			1
" the new movie is scheduled to debut on may 20 -- 10 days after the video game -- so you have been appropriately warned about spoilers			1
each movie is broken down into five gaming levels			1
this outing follows the typical @entity9 game style with straight platform action involving sword fights , cannons and collecting " studs " -- single - connection @entity9 blocks			1
items can be smashed into smaller @entity9 block components , and then collected for points or re-formed into another item that can be used in the game			1
players can use up to eight different characters on each level during story mode , but that can lead to a crowded screen			2
there were a few times when i could n't see what item needed to be collected or got pushed off a narrow ledge because the five characters who were traveling with me all wanted to be in the same spot			2
@entity46 , associate producer at @entity47 , said 70 characters can be unlocked and bought throughout the entire game			1
each character has a special ability that makes it unique from others , including @entity54 ( portrayed in the films by @entity56 )			2
" @entity58 's compass is really different from anything else we 've done ( with @entity61 ) , " @entity46 said			0
" it will point to things @entity58 can find and also helps point to things to solve puzzles in the game			1
" @entity46 said the settings are as iconic as they could be and the team tried to put the @entity9 spin on the movies			0
since the films ' characters are so well known , he said the team wanted to make sure to include little details to help players relate to each character			0
for example , captain @entity78 is often seen with an apple in his hand			0
and @entity58 's running style -- arms straight out , waving frantically -- is humorously well represented			0
" a lot of time went into making sure we got @entity58 's running right , his character right , " @entity46 said			0
the game play is all about exploring the vast scenes in each level			1
puzzle clues and treasure are all over the place , waiting to be discovered			0
" eight collectibles in each level and 10 ships in a bottle can be found , " @entity46 said			0
" there is something always hidden to get			0
" while the story mode only took me about nine hours , i barely collected 40 % of all the items that could be found			0
using @entity58 's compass helps discover the missing booty , but there are also sign postings to help players find key elements in the level			0
since the scenes are so big , it would be easy to get lost or frustrated without those helpers			0
said @entity46 : " the exploration game play ties into the ideology of ' @entity1			1
' plus we wanted to make a distinctive change of pace between the levels , so you are treasure hunting in one level , and then fighting foes in the next			1
" even on ship levels , players will need to go up into the rigging or down into the ship 's belly to find all they need to find			1
@entity46 said each scene has to be solvable for all ages , and the game teaches you what to do and where to look as it goes along			1
there are lengthy story - developing " cut scenes " and cinematics between the levels			1
the humor from the movies really shines in @entity9 form , which uses its blocky medium to put interesting spins on the tale			1
" the humor appeals to all ages			1
we took the iconic movie settings and twisted them slightly to make them funnier			1
plus we took the same slapstick humor from the films and just made more of it			2
" as i said , the fourth movie is also included , so i was worried about spoiling my future enjoyment			2
@entity46 smiled when asked about it but assured me that no details about the story line would be ruined			0
" we will have some of the same locations but none of the dialogue ( @entity9 characters do not speak , only grunt )			0
we do have some of the action from the movie , but it should n't ruin the film for anyone , " he said			2
if you remain concerned , then wait until after the movie comes out before playing the fourth level			2
the one drawback to the game was the two - player co-op play			1
as in other @entity9 video games , two people in the same room can drop in and out as separate characters and solve all the puzzles			0
unlike previous @entity9 games , which forced the two characters to stay in the same screenshot , " @entity1 " actually splits the screen as the characters walk away from each other			1
however , the split in the split screen moved around in relation to where the characters were on the level			0
as the characters got closer to each other , the scene slowly changed back to a single screen			0
it was difficult to focus on what my character was doing or where it was in the split - screen action			0
my co-op player and i found it confusing and , at times , frustrating to figure out where we needed to go or what we needed to do unless we were on the same screen			1
there was never a time where a puzzle needed to be solved in split - screen mode			0
after a while , it just gave me a headache			0
while i often lamented being kept in the same screen in previous @entity9 co-op versions , the split - screen action as presented is not the solution i was looking for			2
once each level is completed in story mode , free play mode is unlocked , allowing you to use any of the characters you have available to solve puzzles that could n't be previously figured out			2
those characters will also get you into previously unavailable areas			0
finding all the collectibles and solving all the brain teasers will keep play going for many hours after the story mode is complete			2
the game is also available for the @entity231 , but there are only 16 levels , and you can use only one character during each level			1
@entity46 said the @entity231 version is tailored to the single - player experience and everything can be solved by one character			2
" @entity1 " is a fun spin on the blockbuster ( pun intended ) movies			1
it ramps up the humor from the films and offers plenty of action for players			2
overall , the game is lots of fun despite some playability glitches			2
and following the adventures of @entity54 ... i mean , @entity54 ... is worthy of any would - be pirate			0
" @entity1 " is now available in the @entity258 and , as of friday , in @entity259			1
it will be released may 19 in @entity260			0
it is available on the pc , @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity231 , and @entity265			0
it is rated @entity267 + due to cartoon violence and comic mischief			0
this review was done playing on the @entity263 in story mode , co-op mode and free play .			1

@entity275 has great humor and animation , appeal for all ages , and massive replayability
each " @entity1 " movie is broken down into five gaming levels
one drawback to the game is the two player co-op play
