-- @entity2 celebrity chef @entity1 has long been on a mission to stir his countrymen 's culinary senses but the gastronomic pioneer has now turned his attentions to an altogether more complex problem -- rustling up gourmet airline food			1
@entity1 was in @entity10 this week to launch @entity14 ' new in - flight @entity12 menu , which he has helped create alongside @entity16 star chef @entity15			1
the luxury fare -- which includes dishes such as " @entity19 of mackerel dressed on a pickled cucumber carpaccio with sour dough croutes " -- will be served on all @entity14 flights for the duration of this summer 's @entity25			1
the collaboration marks the latest link - up between commercial aviation and celebrity chefs as airlines look to improve the reputation of in - flight dining			1
" however hard airlines try , the reputation of food on board planes is not very high , " says @entity33 , former chair of the @entity34			0
" clearly , celebrity chefs are hugely successful and airlines are trying to overcome this stereotypical view of their food being unpalatable or stodgy , " adds @entity33 , who is now professor in hospitality management at the @entity40 in the @entity2			2

@entity55 has previously advised @entity56 on its premium in - flight menus , which include offerings such as a pan-seared salmon escalopes , and tender rib eye steaks in red wine sauce			1
and 26 - star @entity16 chef @entity63 is the gastronomic brains behind @entity66 's @entity65 for business - class passengers , with dishes that have included @entity70 shrimp and turmeric - scented pasta with lemongrass			1
according to @entity33 , however , creating the perfect gourmet airline meal requires a scientific awareness of how the human body operates at high altitude , as well as a keen culinary knowledge			0
" eating on a plane is not the same as eating on the ground , " says @entity33			0
" @entity80 is very dry ( and ) there is very little water in the atmosphere , which affects our taste buds and sense of smell			0
" @entity33 believes that by employing highly skilled chefs who understand this there is more chance of airlines getting their recipes right -- not to mention the positive impact it can have on perceptions of their brand			0

" their primary function may be to create new and interesting in - flight cuisine but it also makes airlines seem contemporary and in tune with the demands of modern customers , " he adds			1
the benefits brought by this brand synergy are also recognized by @entity119 , founder and editor of the @entity121 based in - flight meal monitoring website airlinemeals.net			1
" it contributes to the ' we care for you ' and ' we - offer - great - service ' feeling some airlines are trying to create , " says ' t @entity119			2
he is quick to add , however , that the food created by big - name chefs is often exclusively reserved for business and first - class passengers			2
" when flying economy , you 'll still be ' stuck ' with the ' chicken or pasta ' question -- if you are lucky enough to get a meal , " says ' t @entity119 , whose website has analyzed over 20,000 meals from various airlines around the world			0
" on shorter flights the meals have been brought down to a snack , pizza roll or a simple sandwich			0
there are ( also ) the low cost carriers who offer buy - on - board meals , " he adds			2

he cites his own experience flying with @entity163 business class -- which has introduced the @entity165 principles of @entity167 chef @entity166 into airline food -- as a specific example of the quality of airline dining experience that can be achieved			2
some airlines , including @entity173 and @entity174 , are going one step further and bringing chefs on board to cook and prepare meals whilst in flight , he adds			0
but according to @entity33 it could be a while before any celebrity chefs are spotted cooking up a storm in the cramped quarters of an airplane galley			0
" i genuinely do n't see that happening except as a publicity stunt , " he says			0
he adds that the technology on a plane is limited and the safety considerations of cooking whilst in the air means that those charged with preparing food on board will be restricted in what they are able to create .			0
