-- @entity2 's prime minister @entity1 made headlines after snapping a selfie of herself nestled in between @entity6 prime minister @entity5 and @entity8 president @entity7 at @entity10 's memorial service on tuesday			1
the " selfie " went viral online almost immediately			2
but you could be forgiven for not knowing who this blonde beauty taking a photo with a smartphone of herself with two political power houses is , unless you are @entity2 , like myself , or up to date on your current affairs			1
many newspapers are calling into question whether it was appropriate for " @entity23 , " as she is called by many @entity2 for her sense of style , to take a " selfie " during tuesday 's memorial service			1
the @entity29 wrote that @entity7 tested the limits of " funeral etiquette " ( despite the memorial not being a funeral ) with the self - portrait			2
although they may have been acting less than gracefully at the moment the snap was taken , they did seem to be enjoying each other 's company and @entity1 just could n't resist the urge to document the moment for herself			2
she may after all never have the opportunity again			0
many @entity2 seem not to have taken the whole thing as seriously as some of the newspapers in @entity6			1
as fellow @entity46 put it when reacting to the photo : " more scandi style in politics would do the world a lot of good			0
" some @entity2 are bemused by the global reaction to the selfie -- as it has n't hit their front pages yet -- perhaps reflecting a more laid - back approach in general , as was displayed by their pm in @entity60			1
the general consensus seems to be among @entity2 that the leaders were serious when they needed to be , and the brief moment of levity was unrepresentative of their behavior throughout the whole ceremony			1
@entity2 media has commented on the attention the selfie has drawn in the @entity6 media , where its appropriateness has been questioned			1
the @entity2 after all are known for being down to earth and their country is one of the most equal societies in the world			1
and it seems that @entity1 was far from being intimidated by the power couple she was seated between , and seemed to be enjoying their company : maybe doing her bit for transatlantic relations ? those people shocked at politicians having fun in a situation like a memorial should remember the leaders were not the only ones taking selfies at the memorial			1
and some have even said that it shows a human side to our leaders , who after all are not robots			1
this was not the @entity2 leader 's first meeting with the @entity8 president : @entity7 welcomed @entity1 to the @entity103 in february 2012 and she met him again in @entity104 while @entity7 was on a trip there			2
at the time of her visit to @entity109 she had only been prime minister for four months ; the first woman to hold the post			0
so who says you ca n't have it all ? @entity1 certainly seems to : beauty , brains , family , power and she seems to be enjoying it at the same time			0
@entity1 is married to @entity121 @entity120 , son of the former @entity123 leader @entity122			0
the couple met while she was studying at the @entity125 in @entity126			0
they wed in 2006 and have two daughters together			0
they were investigated in 2010 over allegations of tax avoidance , but were both later cleared			0
no one has yet seen a copy of the " selfie " taken by the pm			2
maybe it was sent to @entity136 -- a photo - messaging app in which photos self - destruct after a certain period -- or maybe it 's one for her personal album			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .			0
