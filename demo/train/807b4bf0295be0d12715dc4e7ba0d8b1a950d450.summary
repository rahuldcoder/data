-- @entity1 and new diplomacy clashed in the flare - up between @entity4 and the @entity5 over the arrest and interrogation of @entity8 -- considered the " @entity9 of @entity4 " -- who skewers politicians of all stripes on his popular tv show , @entity13			1
in the world of traditional diplomacy , governments had more control over what was said about them and by whom			0
as the @entity4 and @entity5 governments discovered the hard way , that control is long gone in the world of 21st century diplomacy with its 24/7 social media and powerful nongovernmental voices			1
when @entity8 , accused of insulting president @entity28 and @entity29 , was summoned for questioning by the @entity28 - appointed prosecutor general , this latest repressive action by the @entity27 government sparked an international outcry			0
the response from the @entity5 came in two forms			0
first , the @entity35 expressed " concern " about @entity8 's detention , citing it as " evidence of a disturbing trend of growing restrictions on the freedom of expression " in @entity4			2
then , @entity9 mounted an eloquent -- and humorous -- defense of @entity8 and freedom of expression through that well - known diplomatic channel , " @entity46			2
" in a commendable act of public diplomacy , i.e. , engaging with the people and not just governments , someone from the @entity52 in @entity53 tweeted a link to " the @entity56 show			0
" after all , the program addressed a current issue in @entity4 politics , with a humorous message about shared values between @entity4 and @entity5 , such as freedom of expression			2
failing to see the humor in the situation , the @entity4 government and the @entity27 struck back			0
the presidential office tweeted a stern reprimand to the @entity5 embassy : " it 's inappropriate for a diplomatic mission to engage in such negative political propaganda			0
" faced with the choice of appeasing the @entity4 government or defending freedom of speech and dissent -- as practiced by @entity8 and @entity9 -- the @entity5 @entity52 in @entity53 chose the former , and shut down its @entity76 feed			1
this decision , reportedly made by ambassador @entity78 , not only violated what the @entity5 allegedly stands for -- the rights of citizens to criticize and hold their governments accountable -- but also displayed a stunning ignorance of how @entity76 and , well , the @entity85 work			2
once something is out on @entity76 , it 's out			0
shutting it down will not expunge it , and will only blow up into a negative story			0
that is exactly what happened			0
within minutes of the shutdown , @entity76 was flooded with condemnation of the @entity5 government for caving to @entity27 pressure and failing to defend basic freedoms			2
although the embassy feed was reactivated within an hour , reportedly at @entity103 's request , the stories and tweets about the shutdown lingered			0
that the reinstated embassy feed deleted all tweets about the @entity8 case reinforced the sentiment already prevalent in @entity4 that the @entity5 sides with @entity28 over the @entity4 people			1
in one act of traditional diplomacy , trying to appease the host government , the @entity5 @entity52 undermined the good will earned by the nontraditional diplomacy of @entity9			1
as a television host , @entity8 exemplifies " soft power , " or the power to influence others through attraction			0
other spinoffs of " @entity46 " in @entity121 and @entity122 , among other places , are adopting not only @entity9 's smart and biting humor , but also core @entity5 values such as free speech			1
in our brave new world , where governments and citizens alike are held up to scrutiny of 24/7 media and social media , and where private - sector television shows can wield more influence than governments , walking the walk as well as talking the talk has never been more important			1
the @entity5 can not present itself as the defender of free speech when it suppresses free speech			1
in removing the tweets about @entity8 and @entity9 , the @entity5 @entity52 in @entity53 undercut its own soft power			1
who in @entity4 will listen the next time an embassy official talks about the importance of free speech or free media ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			1

@entity8 , the " @entity9 of @entity4 , " was arrested for *mocking* @entity4 's president
@entity152 : in the world of 24/7 social media , old and new diplomacy clashed
she says @entity5 @entity52 should not have closed its @entity76 feed after a rebuke from @entity4
@entity152 : the @entity5 must defend free speech , *including* its actions on the internet
