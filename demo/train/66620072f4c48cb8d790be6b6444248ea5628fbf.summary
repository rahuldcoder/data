@entity0 -- the top @entity2 on the @entity3 is moving to hold attorney general @entity4 in contempt of @entity6 for failing to cooperate in the panel 's investigation of the controversial " @entity10 " weapons sting			1
rep. @entity11 , @entity12 , sent a 17 - page memo and a draft contempt resolution to members of his committee thursday , outlining what he argued was @entity19 's " refusal " to comply with the panel 's probe to get information about the sting			1
the program , run by the @entity25 , allowed weapons to be purchased illegally in order to track them to senior drug cartel members , but agents lost track of hundreds of weapons in the process			1
@entity11 indicated the committee may vote on the measure in an upcoming session , setting up a major confrontation between the @entity2 - led @entity3 and the @entity39 administration			1
the @entity19 firmly rejected the committee 's publicly released document			2
in a letter to @entity11 , deputy attorney general @entity42 wrote that the department hopes to find a " mutually acceptable resolution " to demands for documents , but @entity11 's resolution " appears to express a preference for confrontation over resolution			1
" " viewed fairly , the disagreements between the @entity3 and the @entity19 over the scope of the document to be produced stem not from a lack of cooperation , but from our sincere and unwavering believe that disclosure of materials related to ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions could well jeopardize our core law enforcement mission , which must remain free from political pressure or even the appearance of political pressure , " he wrote			0
" this is not a novel concept			0
@entity42 told @entity11 the department has handed over 7,600 pages of material related to the botched probe , and @entity4 has testified about the issue seven times			2
but he said the committee needs to better define the types of documents it wants justice to hand over			2
when word leaked last week that @entity11 was working on such a resolution , the committee 's top @entity78 , rep. @entity80 , @entity81 , sent the chairman a letter accusing him of pressing the issue for political purposes			1
" holding someone in contempt of @entity6 is one of the most serious and formal actions our committee can take , and it should not be used as a political tool to generate press as part of an election - year witch hunt against the @entity39 administration , " @entity80 wrote			1
but in a thursday interview on @entity101 , @entity11 said , " we 're running out of patience			2
" he accused the @entity19 of a " coverup , " but indicated he was still giving the department a chance to hand over the materials			0
" if they do n't , then i have the support of leadership to do what we have to do , " @entity11 said			2
if the @entity3 approves a contempt resolution , the measure could then go to the @entity3 floor for a full vote			2
but @entity1 has been told that @entity11 has no firm plans yet to hold a committee vote , hoping instead that the threat will pressure @entity4 to provide the documents the @entity121 want			1
" while there are very legitimate arguments to be made in favor of such an action , no final decision has been made about moving forward yet by @entity2 leaders , " a senior @entity3 @entity2 leadership aide said when asked about the timing of a potential vote in the @entity3 on the matter			0
last week , house speaker @entity132 deflected questions on any vote , deferring to @entity11 's investigation			1
" i continue to support their efforts and believe that this @entity19 must be held accountable , " @entity132 said			0
in an effort to paint @entity11 's efforts as politically motivated , a @entity139 government source noted that @entity11 and other @entity2 lawmakers protested when the @entity3 voted to hold @entity144 administration officials in contempt in 2008			1
but an @entity11 aide said the two issues are completely different : the 2008 dispute involved officials who worked in the @entity3 and claimed executive privilege , the aide said , while @entity11 is seeking information from an agency over which @entity6 has oversight			1
the committee memo accuses the @entity19 of " reckless conduct " and notes that it has pressed the department for answers for more than a year about the operation and how it related to the death of border control agent @entity10 in 2010			1
@entity10 was shot near the @entity161 border by an illegal immigrant			0
two ak - 47s recovered at the scene were traced back to a database of weapons bought by a straw purchaser and then smuggled into @entity168 in an operation that resulted in the loss of hundreds of weapons			0
after @entity10 's death , the @entity19 initially denied allegations in a letter to @entity6 that it was illegally allowing the flow of weapons to members of @entity168 drug rings			1
but it acknowledged the program about a year later , calling it " fundamentally flawed			0
" @entity4 has since vowed that guns will not be allowed to " walk " from gun shops near the border with @entity168			0
in february , @entity4 told @entity6 the @entity19 was still doing its internal inquiry , but stated that officials could be fired for improper conduct			0
" i can assure you those people will be removed from federal service , " he vowed			0
@entity11 's memo notes that while the @entity19 has provided some materials to @entity192 , most of the information about " @entity10 " came though whistle - blowers and media reports			1
the @entity3 approved a subpoena sent to @entity4 in october 2011 with 22 categories of documents it wanted to see , but the committee says it has only received materials relating to 12 of those categories			0
" for over a year , the department has issued false denials , given answers intended to misdirect investigators , sought to intimidate witnesses , unlawfully withheld subpoenaed documents , and waited to be confronted with indisputable evidence before acknowledging uncomfortable facts , " the memo states			0
@entity42 said @entity211 has provided more documents to its inspector general 's office , which is conducting its own investigation of " @entity10			2
" and cited internal legal opinions dating back to the @entity219 administration to argue against disclosing some documents to @entity6			0
specifically , the committee is pressing for documents that shed light on why the @entity19 first denied and then acknowledged the program			0
it also wants more information on which senior @entity19 officials knew about the operation and who approved it , as well as why the various law enforcement agencies allegedly failed to communicate with each other about the operation			0
@entity11 's committee has been holding a joint investigation with the top @entity2 on the @entity234 , sen. @entity235 , @entity236			1
@entity235 said he supported @entity11 's move to press for a contempt resolution , and urged the @entity19 to " come clean			1
" " the attorney general and the @entity19 are thumbing their nose at the constitutional authority provided to the legislative branch to conduct oversight , " @entity235 said in a written statement			0
the controversy over the operation has prompted some @entity2 members on the @entity249 to call for @entity4 's resignation , and more than 100 @entity121 signed onto a resolution of " no confidence " against the attorney general -- a largely symbolic gesture that is less serious than a contempt resolution .			2
