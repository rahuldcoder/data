-- @entity2 president @entity1 believes @entity4 's @entity3 is the best football league in the world , and claims that @entity7 's top division can learn from it			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity0 's @entity9 , @entity1 pointed to the eight @entity4 - based players in the 2010 @entity12 and @entity4 's @entity13 success as justification			1
" ( looking at the @entity12 ) it must be the strongest league in the world , " he said			0
" and when you see the starting xi of the @entity23 national team ( who won the @entity13 ) , all of them play their football in @entity4			0
the @entity23 league also has the highest number of local players			0
" why were @entity30 players snubbed in all - star team ? @entity1 told @entity9 's @entity32 the lack of @entity7 - based players in the @entity35 undermined the quality of the country 's @entity30			2
" the @entity30 is the best - marketed league in the world , " he said			0
" it 's a good league , with good players , but when you consider not one player made the best xi of the world , maybe they should think about whether something can be adapted			2
" the @entity35 featured six players from @entity47 and two from @entity49 , with the other three from @entity50 champions @entity50			1
among their number was the 2010 @entity54 winner @entity53 , the 23 - year - old midfielder who beat his @entity47 teammates @entity56 and @entity57 to be named the world 's best player for the second year in a row			1
" @entity53 is what i identify as a wonderful football player and a good boy			1
it 's not a game he 's playing , he 's not an actor , " @entity1 said			2
have your say on @entity1 's decisions @entity1 said @entity53 needed to win a @entity13 before he could be compared to fellow @entity72 @entity71 , captain of the 1986 champion side			1
" when i compare @entity53 to @entity71 , both are excellent , talented players			2
they could not be more talented			0
but the difference is their personal educational characteristics , " @entity1 said			0
" one is still in football , modest and not trying to get into the extravaganza			0

@entity2 president @entity1 believes @entity3 is best in the world
eight of the players in the @entity88 play for @entity47 or @entity49
@entity53 *awarded* @entity54 ahead of @entity47 teammates @entity56 and @entity57
