-- if the global economy remains sluggish , a small corner of the @entity3 horse racing hub of @entity4 is very much bucking the trend			2
it is nearly quarter of a millennium since @entity12 founded his eponymous bloodstock auctioneers and , in 2013 , @entity8 ' business is booming			1
back in october behind the gates of @entity16 , a record was set for the most ever spent on a horse in @entity18 -- $ 8.4 million ( £ 5.25 million ) -- for the @entity20 filly by @entity21			1
in a nod to its old roots , all sales are still priced in guineas ( effectively a pound and a shilling ) so @entity29 sheikh @entity28 parted with five million guineas for the honor of buying this prestigious filly			0
excitement , though , is building at @entity8 once more with the first offering from @entity40 having retired and gone to stud with the pregnant @entity35 undoubtedly the most mouth - watering prospect going under the hammer at the two - week december sale , which starts on november 25			1
dancing @entity35 won both the @entity41 and its @entity43 equivalent and it is more than 50 years since an @entity41 winner carrying her first foal has been sold in public auction			1
the fact the foal she is carrying is the offspring of @entity40 , with 14 wins from as many races and undoubtedly the most acclaimed horse of its generation , makes the prospect all the more exciting			1
@entity58 , the marketing director at @entity8 , is loathe to say he expects the record to be broken but big money will undoubtedly change hands			1
" we never expect to break records ; records by their nature are unexpected , " says @entity58			0
" we 've got some huge excitement to come at the december sale with mares carrying the first @entity40 foals , -- in all there are 10 mares in foal to @entity40 -- of which @entity35 is the pick			1
" this is the very best mated to the very best			0
combining those two , you 're narrowing the angles and quite possibly producing the ultimate racehorse			0
she 's a very valuable mare particularly as it 's very rare to find a mare of that calibre on the market			2
" another horse set to test the spending power of horse racing 's power brokers is @entity89 , winner of the @entity92 @entity91 at @entity93 and the @entity94 at @entity95 , in foal for the first time to @entity98 , whose wins included @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , and with an already impressive breeding record			1
" along with @entity35 , @entity89 promises to be the highlight of our december sale , " adds @entity58			2
" that said , there 's plenty others in there too			0
" in some ways , @entity8 , which employs 45 full - time staff in @entity4 and another 20 at their @entity113 base in @entity114 , is like a different world			1
while much of the rest of the world is still feeling the economic pinch , it can at times act like a playground for global millionaires			2
in all , some 40 countries are expected to be represented at the december sale but there is no solitary powerbroker			2
@entity3 and @entity113 buyers , notably @entity128 and @entity129 , remain major players with an increasing number of established and emerging figures from the @entity133 as well as an increasing number from the @entity135			0
for all the money exchanged , there is a remarkably simple process to the @entity8 sales			2
the horses come to @entity8 pre-sale in one of the 850 stables on a 47 - acre site and are there to be viewed by prospective buyers before being led into the sales ring			1
once there , the auction begins			0
as the prices go up and up , @entity58 explains it is " great theatre			0
" but he also admits : " it 's not quite like there are gasps			0
you have some people attending hoping to see drama and excitement unfold but the vast majority are there in a professional capacity			0
" but there was n't one person not caught up in the moment when that filly went for five million guineas			0
" with some 10,000 horses sold each year , the turnover of horses is rapid so , as such , almost as soon as the horses are bought , they are off to their new homes , once the necessary veterinary checks are carried out			1
can a horse , though , ever truly be worth as much as five million guineas ? no one at @entity8 , which takes a 5 % cut from each sale , is about to say so			1
but while there are the auction highlights , there are also immense bargains to be had			0
@entity182 , the @entity184 horse and winner of the @entity186 , was snapped up at another auctioneers for a mere £ 50,000 , a bargain considering its worth now after winning the $ 6.25 million @entity190 classic			2
by the same token , horses do not necessarily go on to live up to their high price tag , making such bidding a risky business , a type of high - risk poker			2
" you get superstars whose first appearance in public is quite underwhelming , " says @entity58			0
" that 's one of the beauties of it			0
no one can predict the future so hence you get some surprises			0
" once those horses are sold , though , @entity8 work is not done and they continue to follow their progress for future potential worth and future potential sales			1
@entity8 remains the name when it comes to bloodstock auctions but , as @entity58 points out , they still have to work at it			1
" we 're the world 's first and @entity18 's largest but we have to work hard to keep the company in that position , " he says			1
" there 's competition out there and the day we think there is n't , is the day we 're in trouble			0
" so we need to keep working hard , to build on our history and make sure we cover as many bases as we possibly can			0
" last year , the company turnover was $ 355.4 million but still some way shy of the firm 's record year in 2007 $ 411.4 million			1
should the december sale be a success , @entity8 are on course to match , possibly exceed that figure			1
with those sorts of numbers , the company looks likely to stay at the forefront of the industry for some time hence .			0
