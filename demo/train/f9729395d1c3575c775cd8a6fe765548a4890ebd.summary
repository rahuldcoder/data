@entity0 , @entity1 -- if the @entity5 royal family had its way , the entire world would recognize the country 's ancient scent , frankincense -- so highly prized the @entity10 brought it to celebrate the birth of @entity13			1
the @entity5 royal family 's perfumer , @entity16 of @entity17 , is one of the world 's luxury perfume brands			1
and it 's on a serious expansion streak , despite the worldwide recession			1
the luxury perfumer was founded 25 years ago at the request of @entity26 , @entity5 's head of state , as a way to both preserve the sultanate 's biblical perfume - making traditions and provide gifts for visiting world leaders			1
now , it 's looking to infiltrate the @entity33 -- and eventually the @entity35 -- markets with its own named stores selling an unique , expensive brand of perfume , and other luxury goods , for the body and the home			1
two new stores are planned for 2010 -- one in @entity44 and one in @entity0			1
the @entity44 store , scheduled to open at the end of march , will be the first outside @entity5			1
the @entity0 store , scheduled to open in may , will be the first outside the @entity50			2
" this is the first part of our strategy to open mono - brand stores in key opinion - forming cities throughout @entity33 and the @entity61 , " @entity51 , the company 's ceo , told @entity2 in an interview from his office in @entity5			1
" we believe that selling our ever - growing catalogue of products within their true environment gives the best explanation of the brand			2
" the perfumer 's flagship store in @entity5 , opened in 2008 , is a contemporary rendition of an @entity5 - style house , complete with @entity73 touches			1
the @entity0 store , scheduled to open in may in the capital 's upscale @entity75 neighborhood , will recreate a @entity0 townhouse , @entity51 said			2
the company already sells its perfumes wholesale through several upmarket department stores in @entity33 , @entity81 , the @entity35 and @entity82			2
besides opening new branded stores , the company has also been busy expanding its product range , moving into both a bath - and - body line , perfumed essential oils and @entity89 hand - made leather goods			1
it also recently re-packaged its line , stressing the company 's royal connection			2
the bottle caps for perfumes jubilation 25 for women and @entity97 for men , fragrances introduced to coincide with @entity17 's 25th anniversary , resemble the dome of the @entity102 in @entity103 and a ceremonial dagger			2
the company 's logo , on the front of the perfume bottles , is also reminiscent of the royal seal			1
" we like to remind people we 're a royal brand , " @entity51 said			2
when the company was founded , it started with a flourish , according to @entity116 , a leading perfume critic and co-author of the book " perfumes : the guide			2
" the royal family first commissioned a leading @entity123 perfumer to create one of the greatest fragrances money could buy			1
" that kind of stuff only happens to a perfumer once or twice in a lifetime , " said @entity116			0
" the money , the artistic freedom , no focus groups , nobody breathing down your neck			0
the whole thing was done with just greatness in mind			0
and the fragrance he came up with , @entity142 , is one of the greats of all time			0
" in the 1990s , though , the company lost its way , @entity116 said , introducing a host of fragrances with no clear artistic direction			0
four years ago , @entity151 hired briton @entity51 , a 29 - year veteran of the luxury goods industry , to kick - start its image -- and grow the brand internationally			1
" the aspiration of the family who owns it , members of the royal family , was to increase its international spread			1
they wanted an international brand that happens to be based in @entity5 , not an @entity5 brand selling internationally			1
" " when i was brought in , it was predominantly a @entity50 - oriented brand , " @entity51 said			0
" they felt that a fairly major change was required			0
" @entity51 hired @entity168 as creative director , a move perfume critic @entity116 said was critical to the company 's newfound success			2
" art direction in fragrance is under - estimated , " said @entity116			0
" a perfume is a message in a bottle			0
it 's not a smell			0
it 's an impression , an idea			0
great fragrances are usually made by a perfumer , and an art director , who says , ' i want it to be like this			0
' " @entity51 said the recession has n't hit the luxury company , which sells a 50 ml bottle of perfume for $ 230 , as hard as one would think			1
" it put our plans back a year basically , " he said			0
" i wanted to open the stores in @entity44 and @entity0 last year			1
instead , we 're doing it this year			0
" asked if it was hard to compete in this era of celebrity fragrances , where every well - known face seems to be trotting out their own line of perfume , @entity51 replied : " what sets us apart is longevity			0
celebrity perfumes are here today , gone tomorrow , often made from cheap , in - the - lab ingredients			0
" " we search for the finest possible ingredients , the rarest ingredients , " he said			0
" we just want the best , without worrying about the cost			0
