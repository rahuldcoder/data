@entity0 , @entity1 -- throughout president @entity5 's political career , he has been dogged by insinuations or , indeed , accusations that he is not " black enough " to warrant strong support from african - americans			1
rep. @entity10 made that assertion when he successfully fended off @entity5 's effort to wrest from him his seat in the @entity14 in the @entity16 primary in 2000			1
@entity17 voiced that sentiment in his losing campaign against @entity5 for the @entity20			2
when @entity5 accepted the presidential nomination of the @entity16 , the celebrity scholar @entity21 groused that the first african - american standard - bearer for a major party had " run from history " by failing to mention explicitly the " black freedom movement			1
" skepticism regarding @entity5 's racial bona fides has continued to surface since he moved into the @entity29			1
rep. @entity31 , for instance , has recently chided him for failing to craft policies that would explicitly target black unemployment and for otherwise neglecting , in her view , to evince a proper acknowledgment of the baleful and disproportionate pain being experienced in black communities on account of the economic downturn			0
what is one to make of this critique ? first , it should not be at all surprising			0
@entity44 is ideologically diverse , just like other communities			0
moreover , as i document in " sellout : the politics of @entity57 , " there exists in black @entity48 a special anxiety about the loyalties of high achievers , especially when their success is largely dependent on whites and others who are not black			2
every prominent black in a predominantly white setting faces , at one time or another , claims from fellow blacks that he or she is " selling out			2
" second , @entity5 's black detractors receive a degree of attention in the news media that is far greater than their representativeness of black @entity48 or their influence within it			1
the great bulk of black @entity44 voters -- upward of 90 % -- supported @entity5 in 2008 and do so today			1
they do so because of his party affiliation , his liberal policy preferences , his identification with the @entity44 - @entity44 community ( the offspring of an interracial couple , he calls himself black and married a black woman ) , his personal attractiveness -- he is uncommonly articulate , handsome , knowledgeable and gracious -- and the fact that with all of the added burdens attendant to his blackness , he was still able to climb the @entity85 of @entity44 politics			2
unlike some of @entity5 's most vocal detractors , the black rank - and - file have a realistic appreciation of the limits of his authority and the power of the forces arrayed against him , including a large , albeit amorphous , strain of racial resentment			1
pained by the economic recession , they refrain from blaming @entity5 and instead direct their ire at those who not only saddled the first black chief executive with such a harrowing task of cleanup but also obstruct him relentlessly and often with barely disguised contempt			2
third , even though @entity5 's black detractors constitute currently only a small sliver of @entity44 public opinion , their critique is nonetheless important in practical , electoral terms			1
it is often the case that a vocal , motivated minority can exercise influence that far exceeds their numbers			0
a drumbeat of complaint calling into question @entity5 's attentiveness to blacks might well diminish the fervency of the support he will need for his re-election effort			1
furthermore , certain actions he might take to respond to the racial critique might well alienate other , nonblack , potential supporters			0
the race line will ensnare @entity5 no matter how he proceeds			0
it will not necessarily defeat him			0
his epochal victory in 2008 showed that , unlike previous eras , our own is one in which a black politician can overcome racial barriers to win the highest office in the land			0
still , the sobering reality is that race remains an important , persistent force in @entity44 life despite the presence of a black family in the @entity29			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			0

@entity147 : some black voices have said @entity5 is *n't* " black enough "
he says many blacks who achieve success face similar charges
@entity147 says @entity5 's rank - and - file support in black community remains strong
most realize that @entity5 is confronting *difficult* issues , powerful forces , he says
