@entity1 's @entity0 recently handed down an " authoritative @entity6 " on the " one country , two systems " model as applied to @entity5			1
@entity7 , a reformist leader and the man who launched @entity1 toward becoming the world 's largest economy , invented the idea originally for @entity12 , but events transpired to make @entity5 the test bed			1
that tiny test bed is currently turning into a big headache for @entity1 's leaders as 787,767 @entity18 voted last week in an unauthorized referendum for what they consider acceptable models of democratically nominating and electing their chief executive -- the city 's top politician -- in 2017			2
at present , @entity5 's chief executive -- currently @entity27 -- is selected by a 1,200 - member election committee with the approval of @entity30			1
many are voting more against the @entity6 , which maintained @entity1 's " comprehensive jurisdiction " over the city , than for one of the models			1
they , and nearly the entire legal profession in @entity5 , object to the paper calling judges " administrators " who must take orders from @entity30			2
@entity5 follows the @entity43 - derived common law system			0
the rule of law , insured by judges independent of the administration is , according to nearly everyone , the key distinguisher between the legal system in @entity5 and that holding sway on the mainland			0
@entity52 unchallenged until now at the core of " one country , two systems " is just how autonomous the smaller system can be against the larger , dominant one			0
and one thing most dependent on that " high degree of autonomy " @entity7 promised is the rule of law			1
this autonomy has been largely unchallenged since 1997 , when @entity43 handed over the city to @entity1			2
but today the issue of just how democratic @entity30 will permit the election of the next chief executive to be has brought the whole concept of genuine autonomy into doubt			0
@entity7 and his successors have repeatedly told @entity12 -- which @entity1 considers to be a renegade province -- under this concept that it could keep its army , currency and separate political system , just as long as it stuck to there being " one @entity1			2
" but the @entity6 on the @entity5 spells out a very different version of autonomy , one that 's closer in terms of central control to the iron fist actually practiced in the @entity83 rather than the velvety promises being given to @entity12			1
@entity18 are up in arms over this -- so far -- typographic crackdown on autonomy			0
but the @entity12 are also not amused			0
and here 's why this drama matters outside @entity1			0
@entity1 has shown first with @entity91 over the @entity92 and now with @entity93 , that it takes its claims to the whole @entity96 ( which includes @entity12 ) seriously			2
@entity1 is very sensitive about any hint of separatist or secessionist activity			0
@entity30 may not see the difference between their concerns for state security and unification , and the local actions in @entity5 that actually have nothing to do with secession from @entity1			1
there are a lot of missiles , ships , submarines , fighters and troops faced off across the strait between @entity12 and the mainland			0
" one country , two systems " is supposedly the peaceful alternative to war for reunification with @entity12			2
if @entity5 shows " one country , two systems " was a promise given by @entity30 with no intent to keep its treaty - given word , @entity12 is very unlikely to agree to reunify with mainland @entity1 under those terms			1
even an international treaty supposedly protecting @entity12 's " high degree of autonomy " would little persuade if there 's a @entity5 crackdown with no international reaction			1
nobody knows what the replacement for " one country , two systems " should be			0
@entity1 is increasingly throwing its weight around , facing off with @entity93 , the @entity135 and the @entity136			0
@entity5 is part of this larger context of @entity1 becoming aggressive and assertive -- and if it 's willing to take on all these nations at the same time , it 's not going to let a few hundred thousand people intimidate it			1
@entity30 promises another reason it matters becomes clear in the paper 's timing , just before last week 's " people 's referendum " on political reform			1
in 2007 , @entity30 promised @entity5 could elect its chief executive by universal suffrage in 2017			2
since it already directly elects over half its legislature , @entity5 is well ahead of the rest of @entity1 in political reform			1
@entity5 has long led the way to both economic and political change in @entity1			0
the village election system @entity7 started in 1982 was directly modeled on @entity5 village elections , and recent elections of @entity159 in a number of mainland cities drew once more on @entity5 's own invention of @entity159 in 1982			1
if @entity1 is going to start making a transition from authoritarian dictatorship to something closer to democracy , the @entity5 test bed is the place to start			0
stopping reform in @entity5 very likely means killing it in the rest of @entity1			1
this matters to the rest of world because democracies have dominated the globe economically and politically for over a century			0
but now , with @entity1 soon taking the top spot economically , will democratic habits of discussion , voting and compromise collide with an elite more accustomed to giving orders that are obeyed ? that 's what makes the @entity6 on @entity5 so important , and so worrying			1
not only does it take a rather imperious tone ; it was issued in seven languages , so much as stating to the rest of world : " pay attention , what we do in @entity5 is our business and no one else 's , whatever an international treaty like the 1984 @entity193 might say			0
" @entity91 , with treaty claims to the @entity195 ; @entity93 , already in dispute with @entity1 ; and the @entity136 , which claims the @entity96 is international waters , according to treaty , take note .			0

" one country , two systems " promises @entity5 a high degree of autonomy under @entity1 rule
@entity30 's recent @entity6 on @entity5 challenges just how autonomous the city can be
" one country , two systems " originally invented for @entity12
@entity211 : success of @entity5 's reform will determine future *relations* between @entity1 , other @entity216 nations
