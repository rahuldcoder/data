@entity0 , @entity1 -- if @entity3 is the crying capital of the world , @entity1 holds the aces when it comes to smiling and laughing			1
it 's not simply anecdotal evidence			0
@entity1 has been adjudged a happiness - ridden country at least twice in recent years			1
in 2003 , the @entity13 's @entity12 magazine conducted a survey that found that @entity1 had the highest percentage of happy people in the world			1
seven years later , another survey , a @entity20 poll this time , found that @entity1 had the world 's highest rates of optimism			1
now do n't ask me about the methodology of measuring @entity26 , or assembling an @entity27			0
what is not in doubt is this : the appearance of @entity1 -- an oil - rich , natural - disaster - starved , fertile - land - suffused country where 70 % of the population survives on less than $ 2 per day -- at the top of these surveys , seven years apart , must mean something			1
months ago , while at school in @entity43 , a @entity41 friend observed the enduring optimism of the @entity1 soul , telling me @entity1 were fond of saying things would work out fine			1
the @entity41 , she explained , were a lot less sanguine			0
decades ago @entity49 musician and ' prophet ' @entity48 saw this			0
the saxophone - wielding sociologist - of - the - streets recorded " @entity52 ' " as a testament to the never - say - die @entity1 spirit ; to the remarkable capacity of the @entity1 soul to look beyond the prison wall and see , at midnight , a sun that not only had n't risen but was not actually slated to rise			1
the song accuses organized religion ( @entity62 and @entity63 ) of brainwashing @entity1 into a delusion - filled contentment with a dysfunctional status quo			1
" suffer suffer for world , enjoy for heaven , " @entity48 chants , in that timeless masterpiece			0
is a ' @entity70 ' next ? commercial buses in @entity0 are mobile placards , bearing text drawn from @entity74 , local sayings and conventional wisdom			0
" one with @entity77 is a majority			2
" " the downfall of a man is not the end of his life			0
" " it is well			0
" the most popular , " no condition is permanent , " says it all ; succinctly capturing the psyche of a people who delight in trading grass - to - grace stories			2
most fascinating are the ones that involve a sudden turn - around : the man who last week did n't know where the next meal was going to come from , but who today is feeding thousands at a party to celebrate his appointment as a government minister			2
pentecostal churches devote a chunk of their services of " testimonies " -- dramatic renderings of miraculous divine interventions			0
president @entity106 's most memorable campaign message involved juxtaposing his shoeless childhood with his adult influence			0
yes , @entity109 did something similar ( his father 's humble beginnings in @entity113 ) , but there was a difference : in @entity106 's version there was the subtext of a @entity77 - ordained destiny			1
it was no ordinary " only - in - @entity1 - is - this - possible - by - dint - of - aspiration " story			1
@entity1 , you see , are strong believers in the concept of a divinely - ordered " destiny " ( not saying this is unique to us , though ) , strongly linked to the names we 're given at birth			1
( we must be the only country in the world whose president is named " @entity106			0
" ) it is because of this gift of nature that you will find @entity1 insisting -- erroneously , of course -- that suicide , like homosexuality , and revolutionary uprising , is an @entity143 act			1
this explains why you 'll find @entity1 who insist that the @entity145 failed not because he was incompetent , but because he was @entity1 , and could n't process the thought of a self - inflicted death			1
and this is why , when a lone suicide bomber attacked the @entity1 police headquarters in @entity152 last june , early reports said he was from a neighboring country			2
@entity1 's oil economics fuel deadly protests in light of the foregoing you can understand why , when the @entity160 commenced , a common topic of discussion amongst @entity1 was " is this possible in @entity1 ? " " can @entity1 rise up in protest against their governments ? " it was often asked in a rhetorical tone , questioner assuming the answer to be ' no '			1
explanations would follow : @entity1 are too docile , too easily compromised , too steeped in hopes of an approaching -- and almost inevitable -- turn - around in their fortunes			1
there is apparently such a thing as an " adjustment bureau " , founded , staffed and headquartered in @entity1 , which helps citizens , like the fabled frog , to consistently adjust to the rising temperature of boiling water			2
in our case until the time when , by divine intervention , the heat is turned off			0
it is therefore with surprise that i have observed , and participated in the series of public protest rallies now known as ' @entity187 ' -- tens of thousands of @entity1 across the country and in the @entity189 , trooping to the streets to protest the insensitivity of a government that cut fuel subsidies benefiting a largely poor population whilst itself guilty of astonishing levels of profligacy			1
at one of the rallies , a man , told me that not even the protests that followed the annulment of the june 12 , 1993 elections -- arguably the most significant act of subversion of the will of the @entity1 people in recent history -- drew such crowds			1
had june 12 drawn those crowds , he said , things would have turned out differently			0
what is behind @entity1 fuel protest ? so what has changed ? what , in the collective @entity1 dna , has undergone a mutation ? why are people trooping to the streets in an unprecedented manner , seeking to register their opposition			1
we 'd have to turn to @entity221 in @entity222 , and the @entity160 , for some explanation			2
all of last year we were treated , via @entity224 and @entity2 , to real - time scenes of dictators literally toppling from their thrones			0
those images are powerful , and i think they filed themselves in our subconscious , awaiting such a moment as this			0
when the moment came , with the 110 % rise in fuel prices on @entity236 , i suspect that an exhuming started happening , of the buried images of people power from last year			0
@entity1 , with some tentativeness at first , and then with increasing boldness , seemed eager to not be left out of the wave of people power that has gripped their continent , everywhere from @entity246 to @entity222 to @entity247			2
@entity1 cuts fuel prices after national strike and then of course the internet provided a platform for the accumulation and direction of the anger and frustration			1
while it may be true that the internet is currently being used only by a minority of @entity1 , it appears that that minority is more significant than we all assumed , because all of those online people are connected to the larger society , and are thus able to channel the information and energy that effortlessly pools online			1
the numbers i saw last week at the @entity268 in @entity0 were astonishing , and hugely inspiring			0
and it grew by the day			0
by thursday the spots where my friends and i stood comfortably on tuesday had been taken over			0
and this was happening in cities all across the country			0
it is still too early to know the full extent of what this means for @entity1 's rather uncertain future			2
but one thing is not in doubt , @entity1 , experts at suffering and smiling , surprised themselves last week			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity285			2

@entity285 found ' @entity77 - ordained destiny ' *mindset* used to stop @entity1 from uprising
but to his surprise , recent protests against the fuel price hike proved something different
the @entity160 has inspired @entity1 to express their opposition , said @entity285
@entity285 also pointed out that the internet is key in directing public opinion in @entity1
