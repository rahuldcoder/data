after spending hours on @entity3 , combing through scores of gorgeous decor photos , do you ever look at your kitchen and hear the " @entity5 , wah , waaaaaaah " of a sad trombone ? kitchens do n't work like other rooms , say decorators , and it 's not always obvious how to decorate them			1
instead of four blank walls to adorn , there are cabinet doors , appliances and counter tops , which can leave you feeling a little boxed in			0
" when we purchased our home we were stuck with a lot of light maple cabinets			1
good storage , yes , but all i saw were square lines , " said @entity20 , the decorating blogger behind " @entity22 by @entity20			1
" one way to deal with a grid of cabinet doors is a rigorous renovation , but not everyone has the budget for knocking down walls or installing custom cabinetry			0
@entity33 took a minimizing approach to her kitchen			1
" the focus became how to soften the cabinets and add texture , " she said			2
she collected soup tureens , baskets and weathered furniture from tag sales , made burlap shades for her chandelier and replaced only the backsplash			0
" now i barely notice the cabinets i once loathed , " she said , because now the kitchen is stocked with decorative items she enjoys seeing every day			1
" you have to look at decorating your kitchen in a different way , " said " chic on a @entity58 " decorator @entity57			2
" it 's not harder , just different			0
the color of your cabinets , the hardware of the cabinets , your backsplash and countertops all make up the decor in your kitchen , whether you like them or not			1
" " people do n't think of these things as decor , but they set the tone of the whole room			1
if they are outdated it can be difficult to decorate around them , " she said			0
simple paint created @entity79 's favorite kitchen feature , two - toned cabinets			1
she applied mourning dove gray paint to the bottom cabinets of the kitchen in her last home , and alabaster white to the top			1
she also employed chalkboard paint and a painted beadboard backsplash to create the cottage look she loves			0
" we made inexpensive cosmetic changes and all of them are easy to change if the new homeowner ever decides to do so , " she said , like adding pine boards and crown molding to make their off - the - shelf cabinets look taller			2
and who 's to say you have to keep the cabinet doors as is ? " sometimes people hesitate using glass doors on cabinets because they want to hide all their mess or they do n't know how to beautifully style them with just simple stemware , " said decorator @entity102 of @entity103 , @entity104			1
@entity20 , too , uses open cabinets as part of her decor scheme			1
" i like to display my pretty things , but keep my countertops clear , " she said			2
the builder - basic kitchens found in many homes can be a source of design frustration			0
the solution , say decorators , is to think " timeless " when approaching the most noticeable aspects of the kitchen			2
" i chose to stay within a very neutral zone , colorwise , to keep it from becoming outdated			0
keeping the cabinets white with a black counter top gives our kitchen a very classic , timeless look , " said @entity125 of @entity126 , @entity127			1
updating the hardware , too , can be an inexpensive and effective update to plain old cabinets			2
" there is something so timeless , classic , bright and elegant about a white kitchen , " said " @entity137 " blogger @entity136			2
but you do n't necessarily have to erase the dated features of the room			2
sometimes , as in @entity147 's case , they can end up lending a very specific feeling to a kitchen			2
" cabinets say a lot of the time period , " said @entity150 , from @entity151			0
" my mother has adorable maple cabinets built in the ' 50s and i think they make the kitchen			1
our home has solid oak from the ' 80s and i think it represents a period of stability			0
" however , when it comes to investing in the kitchen , the practical and decorative choice is countertops			1
" the decor feature that stands out the most in our kitchen , and i would have to say in most kitchens , are the countertops			1
they are a splurge that was well worth it and they make a huge difference , " said @entity136			0
" i first wanted to go with @entity178 , but we are a very active family and i wanted something more durable			0
that 's why i decided on highly durable and strong quartz			0
" kitchens take a beating , and countertops , floors and appliances need to be strong enough to stand the test of countless dinners and holiday feasts			0
at the same time , there 's got to be a cozy , comfortable feel in the room , because it 's the place where family and guests are bound to congregate , said @entity198			0
aside from plenty of comfortable seating , she thinks lighting is key			1
" people are afraid to use lamps in a kitchen , but they really can amp up the coziness of the room			0
a small lamp near the sink or under the cabinets adds a nice warmth to a room that you ca n't get from overhead , " @entity198 said			1
she finds the lamps she put on the buffet table in her kitchen were an easy decorating opportunity that ratcheted up the comfort level			0
