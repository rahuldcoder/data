-- it will be remembered as the day that @entity2 came to @entity3			1
@entity5 's colt -- ridden by the trainer 's son @entity6 -- delivered a scintillating performing to capture the @entity9 , @entity13 's horse racing 's original @entity11 event			1
but while the @entity15 public are accustomed to antipodean sporting success on their shores , in this case , @entity2 has a pedigree that 's a little closer to home			2
the oft - quoted @entity13 horseracing authority @entity23 once said , " fortunately , nobody knows how to breed a @entity9 winner			1
if they did , it would take all the fun out of it			0
" @entity2 's breeder may disagree			2
by 2001 @entity9 winner @entity31 , prepotent sire of , among others , @entity35 , and out of @entity37 winner @entity38 , @entity2 was bred by @entity39 himself , whose ancestor gave this race its name			1
legend has it the decision to name the race after the 12th @entity39 was made on the basis of a coin toss in 1779			1
seven generations later , the present @entity49 was taking no such chances			0
if ever there was a colt bred to the task of winning the @entity9 , @entity2 is it			1
there is a theory about thoroughbred breeding which states : " breed the best to the best and hope for the best			0
" @entity2 , described by his trainer as the best he 's ever trained , carried this hope along with no small measure of expectation			1
sent off as a well backed 11 - 8 favorite , @entity2 ultimately lived up his billing as a horse worthy of adding his name to a roster of champions that includes the likes of @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			2
under a masterful ride from @entity78 , riding his second @entity9 winner after @entity80 in 2012 , the chestnut colt glided home comfortably to win by one - and - half lengths			0
valiant runner - up @entity83 , a previous @entity86 winner himself , rallied bravely before being outclassed in the final stages , while a fast finishing @entity89 completed the placings			0
for @entity5 , it represented a unique hat trick -- no trainer has previously won the @entity9 three times in a row			1
it takes the @entity99 trainer 's overall record to five wins in this race			2
" we are in a very privileged position to have the horses we have , " the master trainer told reporters after the race			0
" we always said that he was very special and to have the pace that he has for a @entity31 is incredible			0
" his son @entity6 added , " i had a grand position and i was going easy coming down the hill			0
there 's no easier horse to ride than him			0
" for @entity39 he became the first member of his family to breed the winner since the 1933 champion @entity119			2

@entity121 wins the @entity9 , the @entity11 of @entity13 racing
@entity124 means trainer @entity125 wins the race three times in a row
@entity2 is bred by @entity39 , whose family the *historic* raced is named after
@entity83 finishes second with @entity134 third
