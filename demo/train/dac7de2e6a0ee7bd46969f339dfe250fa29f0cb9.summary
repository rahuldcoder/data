-- if you 're one of the millions who purchased an @entity3 between sept. 12 , 2006 , and march 31 , 2009 , you might be in for a surprising email			2
it states that you 're being enlisted in a class - action lawsuit against @entity7 — though you do have the right to recuse yourself			1
the class - action lawsuit was originally filed by a customer in january 2005 and was ignited by the creation of the music service @entity11			1
back in 2004 , the company @entity13 created @entity11 as a digital rights management ( @entity15 ) translation service			2
it allowed users to play songs downloaded from the @entity21 music store on @entity7 's @entity3			1
but as any @entity3 user knows , songs must be loaded onto @entity23 to be played on @entity7 's devices			1
that 's because @entity7 created an @entity3 firmware update not too long after the announcement of @entity11 , which blocked it and other music services from uploading songs to the @entity3			1
the customer filed an antitrust lawsuit against @entity7 , accusing the company of unfairly blocking competition			2
now , years later , it 's gaining steam			0
though @entity13 has nothing to do with this case , the			0
@entity38 for the @entity39 gave the lawsuit class - action status in november 2011			1
the website ipodlawsuit.com , which details the entire case , explains : " the lawsuit claims that @entity7 violated federal and state laws by issuing software updates in 2006 for its @entity3 that prevented ipods from playing songs not purchases on @entity23			2
the lawsuit claims that the software updates caused @entity3 prices to be higher than they otherwise would have been			0
" the " class - action status " of the case means that if you own any of these devices — first through fourth generation @entity54 , second and third generation touches , first through third generation shuffles , a fifth generation classic @entity3 or the special edition @entity3 — you 're automatically included in the lawsuit			1
( official notices began going out this week			0
) but you give up any right to sue @entity7 individually over the same concerns			0
alternatively , you could also request exclusion from the case			0
however , if @entity7 does end up losing , you do n't get to share in any kind of " recovery " that may be rewarded			0
so far , there 's no money involved — no actual settlement or reward has been determined			0
if you 're one of these @entity3 owners , will you opt to be excluded from the case , or will you take part in a class - action lawsuit against @entity7 ? sound off in the comments			1
