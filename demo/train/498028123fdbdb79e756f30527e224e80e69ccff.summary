-- @entity2 football coach @entity1 , ever the headline creator , has caused further outcry this week after he substituted @entity6 midfielder @entity5 from his @entity8 side during their @entity10 clash with @entity11			1
@entity8 midfielder @entity5 was substitued @entity1 for his low - energy levels as a result of fasting			1
taking a tired player from the field of play was hardly breaking news , at least it was n't until @entity1 revealed the move had been prompted because the player 's perceived " low - energy levels " were as a result of fasting			1
@entity5 is a practicing @entity26 who , like many of the same faith around the world , is currently not eating during the hours of daylight to mark the @entity33 holy period			2
should fasting footballers be dropped by their managers ? sound off below			1
a discipline that clearly irked @entity1 who said in a post-match press conference : " @entity5 had some problems related to @entity33 , perhaps with this heat it 's not good for him to be doing this ( fasting )			1
@entity33 has not arrived at the ideal moment for a player to play a football match			2
" @entity26 leaders in @entity47 have criticized the opinions of the coach known as the " @entity50 " , but @entity1 did not rule out the possibility of dropping the player for the @entity8 derby between arch rivals @entity8 and @entity55 this weekend for the same reason			2

" i 've always observed @entity33 but i have had to change my habits for health reasons from the first year that i became a professional			0
before that i played at @entity68 [ while fasting ] but after two weeks i felt ill and had to stop			0
" @entity70 's under - 20 football squad passed up the chance to break the @entity33 fast to help them prepare for the forthcoming @entity73 which they host at the end of september			1
the @entity76 confirmed that the @entity77 , the country 's institution which clarifies religious principles and issues edicts , had given specific permission for the players to legitimately avoid fasting			0
it is not just @entity33 which has caused issues between @entity26 players and their clubs			0
the beliefs of @entity90 striker @entity89 have conflicted with the demands of his professional career			0
@entity89 taped over the logo of the @entity90 club 's shirt sponsors - internet gaming company 888.com -- in 2006 because he said @entity96 forbade the promotion of gambling			0
so is @entity1 right to take account of how religious practices may affect his players ' performance ? is it wrong to drop a fasting footballer whose energy levels may be lower than his teammates ? should @entity1 contemplate that a player of faith may perform better in a period of self - enforced discipline ? were the @entity114 players right to carry on fasting even though they were given permission to break the fast ? if @entity89 right to bring his religious beliefs into his place of work ? and can sport and religion ever be separated in a satisfactory way ? let us know your thoughts in the @entity128 box below .			2

@entity1 substituted @entity5 because he had been low energy
the @entity6 midfielder is a *muslim* and had been fasting during @entity33
@entity70 's *national* youth team turned down the opportunity to break the fast
