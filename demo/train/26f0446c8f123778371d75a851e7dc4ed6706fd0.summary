@entity0 climbed rapidly , and then stalled , shortly before it crashed , a top @entity3 official said tuesday			1
" the plane ascended suddenly , with a speed that was above the normal speed limit , and then it went up , " transportation minister @entity4 told reporters after he briefed lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing			1
" afterward , it ( the plane ) stalled			2
" at one point , the plane was climbing at a speed of 6,000 feet per minute , @entity4 said			1
a fighter jet like the @entity15 can climb as fast as 30,000 feet per minute			1
but commercial jets are designed to ascend at a much slower rate			0
the latest data show the @entity0 plane , an @entity21 , was climbing at a rate twice as fast as it " could and should do on its own , " @entity1 aviation analyst @entity18 said			1
" i think that means there was a tremendous amount of winds and weather , " she said			0
the commercial jet lost contact with air traffic controllers on december 28 as it flew from the @entity3 city of @entity32 toward @entity33 with 162 people on board			2
amid increasingly bad weather , one of the pilots had requested to deviate from the plane 's planned route , @entity0 has said			1
and experts have speculated since @entity42 that storms might have played a role in the plane crash			2
if the plane was climbing at 6,000 feet per minute , @entity18 said , numerous alarms would have sounded in the cockpit			1
but if the aircraft got caught in an updraft , she said , the pilots might not have been aware at first of why it was climbing so quickly when they were n't inputting that into the controls			0
picture your speedometer showing your car accelerating when your foot is n't pressing on the gas pedal			0
" the pilots would have had control of the plane , " she said , " but may not have even realized what was occurring because of the confusing readings from the aircraft			0
" last week , searchers recovered the plane 's flight data and voice data recorders , which investigators hope will help them determine what happened aboard the doomed flight			2
@entity3 investigators say audio recordings from the plane 's cockpit contain no sounds of gunfire or explosions , making it unlikely the plane was brought down by terrorism			1
while transportation officials focus on figuring out what happened , search teams are still looking for most of the bodies of the people who were on board the plane			2
more than three weeks after the crash , the remains of 53 people have been recovered , some of them still strapped into seats			0
many of the rest could be in the wreckage of the fuselage , which searchers located last week at the bottom of the sea			0
efforts to examine and get inside the wreckage have been hindered by high waves and strong currents			0
