-- the blacklegged ticks are out , and they 're infecting hundreds of thousands of @entity2 with a bacterial illness -- more often than experts previously thought			1
about 300,000 @entity2 each year are diagnosed with @entity5 , according to new estimate released by the @entity7 this week			0
that number is 10 times higher than the number of cases reported annually to the @entity7			0
the latest estimates were presented at the @entity12 on @entity5 and @entity13 on august 18			0
" this new preliminary estimate confirms that @entity5 is a tremendous public health problem in the @entity2 , and clearly highlights the urgent need for prevention , " said dr. @entity14 , chief of epidemiology and surveillance for the @entity7 's lyme disease program , in a statement			1
lyme disease , which comes from a bacterium called @entity24 , is the most common illness spread by ticks in @entity27 and @entity28 , according to the @entity29			1
blacklegged ticks can spread such bacteria while feeding on the blood of animals and humans			1
most humans are infected by immature ticks called nymphs , the @entity7 says , which generally feed during the spring and summer months			1
ticks carrying this disease hang out in grassy and heavily wooded areas			1
patients who take appropriate antibiotics early on in the disease are likely to make a full recovery , according to the @entity29			1
it may take longer to respond to treatment in later stages of @entity5 , but , with appropriate treatment , most people recover completely			1
why you should be afraid of lyme disease symptoms fever , headache , fatigue and a rash called erythema migrans are all typical symptoms of @entity5			1
this rash often resembles a bull 's eye and can appear within a few days of infection			1
between 70 % and 80 % of people with @entity5 develop this rash , and some patients develop it at more than one location on their bodies			1
left untreated , the @entity5 infection can spread to the joints , heart and nervous system , according to the @entity7			1
this can lead to joint pain and swelling			0
after several weeks to months , patients may also experience swelling of the membranes surrounding the brain , temporary paralysis of one side of the face and " brain fog " : forgetfulness or confusion			0
what to do if you get bitten ticks can be tiny : deer ticks may be as small as the head of a pin , so look for them carefully			1
removing a tick within 24 hours cuts your risk of developing lyme disease because it takes time for the bacteria to move from the tick to the host			1
the longer the tick is attached to the human body , the more likely that person will be infected			0
use tweezers to carefully and steadily pull the tick off , grasping near its mouth or neck			0
then put antiseptic on the infected area			0
contact your doctor immediately if you 've been bitten by a tick and start to experience symptoms			0
even if your symptoms disappear , you should still see a doctor			0
treatment the standard treatment for @entity5 in early stages is oral antibiotics			1
usually , a 14 - to 21 - day course is recommended , but some studies suggest that a 10 - to 14 - day course is equally effective , according to the @entity29			0
if the central nervous system has been affected by the disease , intravenous antibiotics may be given for 14 to 28 days			2
this treatment eliminates the infection , but you may need more time to recover from symptoms			1
the side effects from this treatment may include a lower white blood cell count , diarrhea or infection with other organisms resistant to antibiotics that are unrelated to @entity5			2
prevention the @entity7 recommends wearing insect repellent with at least a 20 % deet concentration and avoiding wooded areas with high grass areas where ticks are most often found			2
it also suggests checking for ticks daily and showering soon after being outdoors			2
using a washcloth while bathing may remove any unattached ticks lingering on the skin			2
covering yourself outdoors can also help : wear shoes , long pants , long - sleeved shirt , hat and gloves in wooded or grassy areas , says the @entity29			0
your pets can also bring ticks into the house , so check them regularly			2
more facts about ticks these arachnids ca n't fly or jump but rather wait for a host -- whether it be a mammal , bird , reptile or amphibian -- to feed on while resting on the tips of grasses and shrubs			2
they hold on to leaves and grass with their lower legs , a position called " questing			2
" as the host passes by , the tick climbs on and finds a place to bite			0
besides @entity5 , ticks can also transmit other illnesses such as babesiosis and @entity177 tick fever			0
