-- authenticity has become one of those buzzwords that we love to hate			1
like many other words that have met a similar fate after being co-opted , misused , and overused , authenticity entered the popular lexicon because it tapped into something powerful in our culture			1
having spent the past decade studying human behavior and the thoughts and emotions that drive it , i would guess that the concept of authenticity tapped into our yearning for more genuine and sincere connection and for less manipulation and pretending			2
it does n't matter if we 're talking about politics , work , school , family life , or our kids ' soccer games -- we 've grown tired of being hustled			2
watch @entity29 's @entity28 : listening to shame unfortunately , hustling did n't fall out of favor the same way the word authenticity did , leading me to believe that a conversation about what it really means to be authentic could be helpful			1
i think the conversation is more important than the buzzword issue			0
and i do n't buy the criticism that if you have to talk about authenticity , you 're not being authentic			1
to me , that 's a lot like saying , " if you have to ask how much it costs , you ca n't afford it			2
" well , the folks i know who have lots of money always ask how much something costs before they buy it			0
the fear of being perceived as unable to afford the new shoes is what gets us into trouble			0
the same is true with this conversation -- fear keeps us silent , but i do n't see a lot of evidence that not talking about authenticity has given us much clarity about what it means to stop pretending , pleasing , and performing			2
@entity28 : @entity61 on " embracing otherness " before i started doing my research , i always thought of people as being either authentic or inauthentic			2
@entity65 was simply a quality that you had or that you were lacking			0
i think that 's the way most of us use the term : " he 's a very authentic person			2
" but as i started immersing myself in the research , i realized that like many desirable ways of being , authenticity is not something we have or do n't have			2
it 's a practice -- a conscious choice of how we want to live			0
authenticity is actually a collection of choices , choices that we make every day			0
it 's the choice to show up and be real			1
the choice to be honest			0
the choice to let our true selves be seen			0
some people consciously practice being authentic , and some people do n't , and then there are the rest of us who are authentic on some days and not so authentic on other days			0
trust me , even though i know plenty about authenticity and it 's something i work toward , if i 'm feeling too vulnerable or i 've been trapped in a shame spiral of " never good enough , " i can sell myself out in a second and be anybody you need me to be			1
@entity28 : @entity29 on the power of vulnerability given the magnitude of the task at hand -- to be authentic in a culture that teaches us that being imperfect is synonymous with being inadequate -- i decided to use my research to better understand the anatomy of authenticity			1
what emerged from the data as the most powerful elements of building authenticity were understanding that authenticity is a choice and a practice -- having the courage to be vulnerable , and engaging with the world from a place of worthiness rather than a place of shame or " never enough			1
" when i started thinking about what it really means to practice authenticity , i realized that choosing " being real " over " being liked " is all about playing it unsafe			1
it means stepping out of our comfort zone			0
and believe me , as someone who has stepped out on many occasions , you 're likely to get knocked around when you 're wandering through new territory			0
@entity28 : the @entity134 's secret stories it 's easy to attack and criticize someone while he or she is taking a risk -- voicing an unpopular opinion , or sharing a new creation with the world , or trying something new that he or she has n't quite mastered			1
cruelty is cheap and rampant -- especially when you attack and criticize anonymously , as technology and the @entity147 allow so many people to do these days			0
if you 're like me , practicing authenticity can be a daunting choice -- there 's risk involved in putting your true self out in the world			1
but i believe there 's even more risk in hiding yourself and your gifts from the world			1
our unexpressed ideas , opinions , and contributions do n't just go away			0
they are likely to fester inside and eat away at our sense of worthiness			0
however afraid we are of change , the question that we must ultimately answer is this : what 's the greater risk ? letting go of what people think , or letting go of how i feel and what i believe and who i am ? e. e. cummings wrote , " to be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best , night and day , to make you everybody but yourself means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting			1
" i 'm convinced that choosing authenticity is one of the most courageous battles that we 'll ever fight			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity29 .			1

@entity29 says " authenticity " is a word that 's out of favor , but it 's *key* to a *fulfilling* life
she says people who choose to express their real self risk criticism and shame
@entity29 says there 's more risk if we keep our selves *bottled* up , *losing* faith in our worth
