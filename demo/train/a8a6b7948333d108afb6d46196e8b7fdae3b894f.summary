@entity0 -- @entity3 's public service broadcaster , the @entity4 , was caught up in a growing furor saturday over claims that a late children 's tv presenter sexually abused young women and girls , sometimes on its premises , in the 1960s and 1970s			1
the abuse claims , which come almost a year after presenter @entity15 died , were made by five women in a documentary screened by rival broadcaster @entity19 wednesday			1
those interviewed for the film , titled " exposed -- the other side of @entity15 , " gave detailed accounts of sexual assault while as young as 14 or 15			1
one said she was raped by him at age 16			0
interviewed on a @entity4 program saturday , @entity4 director of editorial policy @entity28 gave what appeared to be the strongest confirmation yet from the broadcaster of wrongdoing on its premises			2
" i think the fundamentals of the story are now well established , " he said			0
" we now know that a number of women were appallingly sexually abused by @entity15 , sometimes on @entity4 premises , at times during the 1960s and 1970s			1
" the police are now involved in the matter and the @entity4 says it is cooperating fully			2
@entity0 's @entity44 said in a statement friday that its officers had met with representatives from the @entity4 and a national child protection charity			1
" we are now collating information gathered from a range of sources across the @entity3 and will continue contacting individuals who have made allegations in relation to the late @entity15 over the coming weekend , " it said			1
" we do not expect to have a clear picture of exactly how many women may have suffered abuse until next week and want to allow time for victims to reflect on what they may have experienced			2
" @entity15 , who hosted popular children 's tv programs including " @entity62 " and " @entity63 , " was a household name in @entity3 for decades			1
he was also well known for his charitable work , having raised millions of pounds , and was awarded a knighthood			1
he died last october aged 84			0
a @entity4 statement released earlier this week said it was horrified by the claims that have emerged			1
" a number of serious and disturbing allegations have been made over the past few days about the sexual abuse of teenage girls by sir @entity15 , " it said			1
" some of these allegations relate to activity on @entity4 premises in the 1960s and 70s			1
we are horrified by allegations that anything of this sort could have happened at the @entity4 -- or have been carried out by anyone working for the @entity4			2
" they are allegations of a serious criminal nature which the police have the proper powers to investigate			0
" a nephew of @entity89 , @entity90 , said he had " every faith " his uncle was innocent of the claims and would have defended himself " vigorously " had the allegations been made in his lifetime			2
" it seems to me a terribly one - sided program			0
how can anybody defend themselves if they are not here to do that ? " @entity90 said in a recent interview with @entity3 's @entity105 newspaper			0
" it just seems to be very , very sad that these comments have come out now			0
if there was any truth to them at all , why did n't they come out years ago when it actually happened ? " the controversy has prompted a wider examination of an apparent culture of sexism at the @entity4 in past decades that may have fed into abusive behavior			0
@entity116 , a dj who started working at @entity117 in 1987 , just after @entity15 left the station , described the environment then as " like walking into a rugby club locker room			0
" she told @entity121 on saturday that his behavior was an " open secret " within the station , saying , " round @entity117 everybody joked about @entity15 and young girls			2
" she was also routinely groped by another radio presenter while live on air , she said -- and her complaints about this were met by ridicule			0
@entity116 acknowledged that the broadcaster would treat such a complaint differently now , but said that at the time she was groped its response had been out of step with public views on acceptable behavior			0
the @entity4 has also come under pressure to explain why its own flagship @entity141 program , which looked into a previous police investigation into abuse claims against @entity146 last year , decided not to run the story			1
that police investigation was dropped for lack of evidence			0
the program 's editor , @entity151 , said the decision was made solely for editorial reasons .			0
