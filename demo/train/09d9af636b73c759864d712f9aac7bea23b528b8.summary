@entity0 -- it 's hard to imagine the atmosphere in @entity4 getting any more toxic , but it could if senate majority leader @entity5 carries out his threat to use the " nuclear option " to budge stalled presidential appointees forward			1
a top @entity10 aide warns that important bills like the recently approved immigration measure would never pass in a post-nuclear @entity13			2
" if they blow the place up , then anything requiring a big bipartisan push like immigration will be impossible , " the @entity10 aide said			0
@entity20 step closer to " nuclear option " in filibuster fight republicans will protest by slamming the brakes on action in the @entity13 , current and former senior @entity13 aides from both parties predicted to @entity1			1
the poisoned atmosphere could stall passage of several important items moving through @entity4 like tax reform , judicial nominations , government spending bills and a debt ceiling increase			0
even a relatively modest rewrite of student loan laws could be in jeopardy , meaning students headed to school this fall would have to pay higher interest rates			0
5 political stories to watch this week @entity20 control the @entity13 but do n't have the 60 votes necessary to break a filibuster			2
@entity5 warned @entity10 if they do n't drop filibusters against @entity47 's @entity46 and agency picks , he will take the drastic step of changing @entity13 rules without @entity10 consent			1
the change would prevent filibusters of executive branch nominations , allowing them to be confirmed on a simple majority vote			0
a last - ditch effort to head off the crisis will come monday night , when all senators are scheduled to attend a closed session that @entity10 requested in the historic @entity60			1
' bipartisan cooperation will come to a grinding halt ' " a likely result of @entity5 triggering the nuclear option will be an erosion in the comity that makes the @entity13 the unique institution that it always has been , " one senior @entity10 staffer told @entity1			1
" it is very likely that bipartisan cooperation will come to a grinding halt			1
" a top @entity20 aide said , " the immediate aftermath will be messy			0
the @entity10 will shut down the @entity13 and they will keep it locked down until there are tangible impacts from inaction			2
only then , when people start to realize that their lawmakers are not working on the farm bill , immigration , budget and other issues , will they pick up the phone and call their lawmakers			0
" @entity84 , a former top aide to @entity5 , said @entity10 have a number of options to slow things down			2
" i 'm not so sure what else ( @entity93 leader ) sen. ( @entity94 ) @entity93 can do to slow down the @entity13 more than he already has , but i 'm entirely confident he has any number of tricks up his sleeves , " said @entity84 , who was with @entity5 in 2005 when @entity10 , then in the majority , threatened to use the nuclear option to prevent filibusters against president @entity92 's judicial nominations			1
" declining unanimous consent agreements , doubling the number of amendments they 're demanding , using special procedures to try and divide bills into multiple sections			0
they have a number of options available to them			0
" republicans would n't disclose exactly how they will respond but made clear they wo n't stand idly by			0
" i think this senator summed it up nicely , " said @entity111 , a senior aide to @entity93 , pointing to a quote from then - sen. @entity47 during the 2005 standoff			1
" everyone in this chamber knows that if the majority chooses to end the filibuster , if they choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic debate , then the fighting , the bitterness , and the gridlock will only get worse , " @entity47 said then			1
both @entity5 and @entity93 were asked on sunday about being on different sides of the argument in 2005			2
@entity5 said the change he is proposing is " very minimal , " applying only to @entity46 and executive branch positions			2
" this is not judges , this is not legislation -- this has allowing the people of @entity138 to have a president who can have his team in place , " @entity5 said on @entity132 's " @entity131			2
" " this is nothing like what went on " in 2005			0
appearing later on the same program , @entity93 seemed to tamp down some of the acrimony			0
three days after saying @entity5 would be remembered as the worst @entity13 leader ever , @entity93 said @entity5 was " a reasonable man , he 's a good majority leader			1
" opinion : do n't say ' dysfunctional @entity4 ' who would come out worse if crisis not resolved ? a @entity20 leadership aide said @entity10 have more to lose in a slowdown than @entity20 do			0
" the conundrum -- for @entity10 , not for @entity20 -- is whether they can bear shutting the @entity13 down over a rules change that allows simple nominations to be confirmed , and therefore also end support for popular items like immigration reform , the farm bill , and investments in education , infrastructure and health research , " said a @entity20 leadership aide			2
" it may play well with their base , but the outrage is certain to fall on deaf ears with the @entity171 community , farmers , teachers , parents and students			0
" two other veterans of the 2005 fight , which was resolved after a bipartisan " @entity179 " senators reached a compromise , expressed hope this standoff would be resolved , too , without a change in filibuster rules			1
at that time , @entity185 was a top aide to then - majority leader @entity186 of @entity187			1
he described the threat then as an " action - forcing mechanism " that resulted in the creation of the " @entity179			0
" @entity185 warned if @entity5 employs the nuclear option now it would " dramatically change the very nature and culture of the @entity13 , spilling over into already poisonous partisan debates down the road and making resolution of those issues even more difficult			1
" he said he is hopeful , but not optimistic , that when senators meet monday night , the seriousness of the potential consequences will lead to " cooperation and compromise			1
" a @entity20 aide , who was also at the center of the 2005 fight and who asked not to be identified , said he hopes when the senators meet privately maybe " some of the more seasoned veterans of these battles " will come forward and say " ' is n't there a way to resolve this ? ' that 's what happened in 2005			2
" @entity93 said sunday that he hoped an ugly fight can be avoided , as it was in 2005 when " cooler heads prevailed			0
" " we knew it would be a mistake for the long - term future of the @entity13 and the country			1
that 's what i hope is going to happen here , @entity220 , " @entity93 told @entity132 's @entity220			0
" we have an opportunity to pull back from the brink in this meeting we 're going to have of senators in the @entity13 chamber monday night			1
i hope we 'll come to our senses and not change the core of the @entity13			0
