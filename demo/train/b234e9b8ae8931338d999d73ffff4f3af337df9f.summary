-- it 's been 11 years since @entity2 , a deaf , gay @entity3 man , first learned he was @entity4 positive			1
but the events of that day are all too vividly etched on his mind : after a brief but anxious wait inside a @entity11 clinic , near @entity12 , a doctor called him in his office			0
the doctor , unable to communicate with him in sign language , quickly wrote something in a piece of paper and stuck it in front of him			0
" you are @entity4 positive " read the note			1
" he did n't explain anything , " @entity2 recalls in sign language as tears roll down his face			2
" he just stuck this paper in my face and i was like : ' me ? what you 're telling me is the truth ? ' and the doctor said ' yes , ' and i could lip read and i asked him ' is it the truth ' and he said ' yes ' and the doctor told me ' go now , bye bye			0
' " the news left @entity2 shocked and devastated as he struggled to grapple with how to cope with the disease and a community unsure of how to deal with him			2
" it was hard for me -- first i 'm deaf , secondly i 'm gay and thirdly i 'm @entity4 positive , these three things , what must i do ? " says @entity2 , who was 25 when he was diagnosed with @entity4			1
he decided , however , not to hide but to share his story and use his experience to inspire the deaf community to communicate openly about sex			1
" i thought for myself , i need to make a stand and i need to be open and out -- i 'm gay , this is me , it 's my identity , i 'm the same as everyone else			0
a lot of deaf people still are closed up , keep it covered in the closet and i 'm taking a stand			0
" today , @entity2 's stance has seen him become a leading figure within the deaf and the gay rights community in @entity3			1
over the last few years , he 's been visiting schools for deaf children across @entity3 , organizing workshops where he uses visual techniques to teach deaf sex education counselors how to raise awareness about @entity4 and @entity66			1
" when i turned 30 , " @entity2 says , " my family came together and i 'm out -- i 'm out about being gay , about @entity4 positive , my sister fainted , they thought i was going to die and i said ' no , i 'm going to be a role model for the deaf community , i 'm going to motivate them , support everyone , i 'm going to educate everyone , i 'm going to try and stop @entity4 , i 'm going to stop the blame and still i feel good about that			1
' " @entity2 cites @entity3 constitutional court judge , @entity79 , the first @entity3 official to publicly announce his @entity4 status , as his own role model			1
when @entity2 heard him speak a few years ago , @entity79 had already been living with @entity4 for 20 years			1
@entity79 's public announcement inspired @entity2 to also spread his heartfelt message			2
" i wanted that same feeling , i wanted to stop this stigmatization within the deaf community			2
' " " there 's no education , the clinics are n't helping , we 're just hitting a brick wall , what does @entity4 mean ? nobody knows and they 're just dying , i was like i 'm going to stand up and say i 'm going to show you -- the same that i saw @entity79 do -- for the disabled community			1
" meletse recently collaborated with @entity97 which chose him to be part of a public awareness campaign about @entity4 in the deaf community			1
" people with disabilities throughout the world -- and we 're talking about a billion people here -- are often ignored when it comes to issues of @entity4 and @entity66 prevention , access to treatment , access to counseling and other preventative techniques , " says @entity101 , senior researcher in the @entity102 of @entity97			2
" this is because people living with disabilities are assumed not to have a sexual life , and it 's something that for us is of great concern because we 're seeing an increasing number of people living with disabilities who are now at risk of contracting @entity4 and @entity66 because they simply do n't have the information or the access to that kind of information , " she adds			2
driven by his desire to help others , @entity2 is determined to work hard to dispel myths and change attitudes			0
" people look at disabled people and they say ' ha , they do n't know about sex			0
' no , we 're all the same , deaf people have sex , hearing people have sex			0
so blind people also have sex , all these things , we all do it			0
" but it 's hard -- interpreters at clinics , there are so few			0
for blind people in @entity151 , what material is printed ? ramps for people in wheelchairs entering the clinic , it 's hard			0
i respect the disabled people for trying in this world			0
