-- at 10 friday morning , the @entity1 will give @entity2 the best holiday gift of all : a stamp in his @entity6 passport that will allow the @entity8 activist to leave the country and return home to his family			1
the exit visa will put an end to @entity2 's chilling saga that began in september in the icy waters surrounding an @entity17 oil rig			1
he was among 28 protesters and two journalists aboard the @entity8 ship @entity21 who were arrested by @entity1 authorities and thrown in jail			1
@entity2 , 48 , was on the helicopter deck of the ship , taking in a full moon and a sunset on that september evening			1
it was a sight to behold in the @entity17			1
amid the breathtaking beauty , he saw on the horizon what looked like a little wasp buzzing around , getting bigger and bigger			0
suddenly , a massive helicopter swooped down , the monstrous gusts of winds knocking @entity2 off his feet			1
@entity1 paratroopers stormed the @entity8 ship			1
it was frightening and @entity2 felt queasy , his just - eaten dinner barely digested			1
five days later , he found himself locked up in a @entity1 prison that seemed a mix between a joke and a @entity48 - era novel by @entity49			1
it was dilapidated and rat - infested			2
some windows were broken and the central heating did n't work everywhere			0
" it was like stepping back in time , " @entity2 said			1
he 'd worked for @entity8 , perhaps the world 's best known environmental activist group , since 1989 and on campaigns across the world			0
he joined the mission to protest the rig owned by @entity1 company @entity61 because he firmly believed oil companies had to be stopped from drilling for fossil fuels in the @entity17			1
suddenly , his life seemed severed from all that he loved -- his wife and two children in @entity68 , his dog @entity70 and his passion for ping pong			0
@entity1 had not only jailed him but he , like the other @entity17 30 , as they became known , were facing charges of piracy so serious that he was looking at a possible 15 years behind bars			1
at home in @entity80 , those kind of charges meant the authorities had a heap of evidence against the accused			0
he felt " pretty damn desperate , " he said thursday			0
" that was a very hard night for me in prison			2
" the charges were later reduced to " hooliganism " which still carried a penalty of seven years in jail			0
each day , the minutes ticked slowly			0
@entity2 passed time by reading , though it took a long time for the prison to receive books sent by family and friends and even longer to add them to the library			1
author @entity102 's light - hearted writing struck the right chord			0
" one had to pace one 's reading , " he said , " because staring at the ceiling lying in your bunk with nothing to take your mind off your immediate predicament was not a good place to be			2
" the cell was about 18 feet by 7 feet and contained three men -- @entity2 and two inmates already there on criminal convictions			1
the floorboards had rotted out , the window , busted			0
a toilet was separated by thin , wooden panels -- a call of nature at dinner hour was not appreciated by other cellmates			2
the light was on 24/7 and the air was thick with cigarette smoke , something that bothered @entity2 , a nonsmoker			1
@entity2 got on famously with his two cellmates , a fact that is fundamental , he said , to enduring prison life			1
he discovered through a strange form of lingua franca the reason for incarceration of his cell mates			0
they played chess together once @entity8 managed to send across a set			2
" during these games i found out , quite slowly , that 's ' was in for double manslaughter and ' v ' was in for gangland violence , " @entity2 said , referring to his cellmates			1
" despite the differing reasons for our incarceration we became very close friends			0
" he spent 23 of 24 hours every day in that cell			0
he was allowed one hour a day of solitary exercise in a small pen			0
he dreamed of playing ping pong , a game he loves enough to list as a hobby on his @entity8 profile			2
another lifesaver was a @entity1 human rights activist who visited him regularly			1
the @entity6 prisoners nicknamed her mrs. @entity161 because she ( rather unkindly , he said ) resembled the hedgehog washerwoman in a @entity164 tale			0
@entity2 , like everyone else , lost a lot of weight during his imprisonment			2
the food , he said , was truly awful			0
" the evening meals quite often contained fish heads			0
this mainly got flushed away as it was unpalatable even when really hungry			0
" the ordeal ended last week , when a sweeping amnesty program in @entity1 allowed the @entity17 30 to go free			1
@entity1 president @entity176 has been generous with " get - out - of - jail free cards " of late			2
the amnesty law freed business executive @entity180 and two members of @entity1 punk band @entity182 , jailed for a performance critical of @entity176			1
@entity2 said he was relieved			2
" i think the @entity1 @entity186 had quite a bit to do with it , " he said about the upcoming 2014 winter games in @entity185			2
@entity2 hopes to leave for @entity188 friday morning			2
in the meantime , some prison habits have been hard to shake			2
he does his own laundry , cooks his own noodles with a boiling ring in his hotel room and eats kasha ( porridge ) every morning			0
" such activity before prison would have been pretty alien to me , " he said			0
despite prison , @entity2 seems committed to @entity8			1
he spoke thursday about how dangerous drilling for oil in the @entity17 is to the environment			1
but for now , he just wants to get back home to @entity68 , to his family			0
he wants to light a wood - burning stove and brew a good cup of tea			0
and take his dog for a long walk .			0
