less than a week after a tightly controlled trial , a @entity1 court tuesday found a prominent @entity4 scholar guilty of " separatism " and sentenced him to life in prison , his lawyer said			1
@entity9 , an economics professor at @entity11 's @entity10 , was tried for two days last week at the @entity12 in @entity13 , capital of @entity14			2
the trial took place in @entity1 's restive western region where a spate of recent violent incidents have been blamed by the government on @entity4 separatists seeking to establish an independent state			1
the court also ordered the confiscation of all of @entity9 's assets , said @entity26 , one of @entity9 's lawyers , police detained the 44 - year - old academic -- along with several of his students -- in @entity11 in january and took him to his native @entity14			2
@entity9 spent months in jail before state prosecutors charged him with the serious crime of " splitting the country			0
" @entity26 told @entity35 before the court announcement that he and his client were prepared for a guilty verdict and would appeal			1
the ruling @entity41 controls all aspects of @entity1 's judicial process and , according to the country 's supreme court , the conviction rate for criminal trials stood at 99.9 % at the last count			1
" whatever the result , he said he would face up to it , " @entity26 said , while anticipating a heavy sentence for @entity9			0
" but he emphasized he 's not a separatist , just someone who offered constructive criticism on the government 's ethnic policies			0
" " he maintained that he 'd always been trying to preserve ethnic unity , not to destroy it , " the lawyer added			2
" what he wanted was the implementation of human rights , rule of law and genuine autonomy in @entity14			0
" ' respected professor ' in a statement , the @entity64 called on @entity1 authorities to release @entity9 , describing him as a " respected professor who has long championed efforts to bridge differences between @entity70 and @entity71			1
" although @entity9 was indicted only in late july , @entity14 police said in a statement in january that they had gathered firm evidence of him colluding with overseas forces to " spread separatist ideas , incite ethnic hatred and advocate @entity14 independence			0
" the police statement also accused @entity9 of teaching students about " violent @entity4 resistance " in his class and encouraging them to overthrow the @entity1 government			1
@entity85 secretary of state @entity84 said that the harsh sentence appeared to be " retribution for professor @entity9 's efforts to promote human rights for @entity1 's ethnic @entity91 citizens			1
" he added that @entity9 and those like him were " indispensible in helping to resolve the underlying causes of unrest and violence " and " silencing them can only make tensions worse			0
" @entity9 's defense team has challenged the @entity13 court 's jurisdiction over the case and complained about the poor treatment of their client in jail , which at one point caused him to stage a ten - day hunger strike in protest			2
the lawyers recently said that @entity9 was put in shackles and denied warm clothes in a cold cell			0
the @entity14 government did not immediately respond to @entity35 's call for comment tuesday			1
lawyer @entity26 said @entity9 was mostly calm and relaxed during the trial but launched an eloquent and passionate hour - long self - defense toward the end of the hearing , prompting the judge to warn him " this is not your lecture hall			0
" human rights campaign group @entity124 said the verdict and heavy sentence was an affront to justice			0
" @entity9 worked to peacefully build bridges between ethnic communities and for that he has been punished through politically motivated charges , " said @entity129 , @entity1 researcher at @entity124			1
" @entity9 is a prisoner of conscience and the @entity1 authorities must immediately and unconditionally release him			1
" international attention @entity9 's fate has attracted great international attention			0
@entity139 diplomats -- including representatives from the @entity85 embassy in @entity1 -- and journalists trying to attend the " open trial " last week were kept at bay , as uniformed and plainclothes police flooded the area around the court			1
the authorities allowed in four @entity9 family members -- his wife and three brothers -- who had not seen him for nine months			0
the @entity85 government has expressed deep concern over the scholar 's case and called for his release on several occasions			1
" his arrest silenced an important voice that peacefully promoted harmony and understanding among @entity1 's ethnic groups , particularly the @entity70 , " a spokesman for the @entity85 embassy in @entity11 told @entity35 after the trial			1
" we stress the importance of @entity1 authorities differentiating between peaceful dissent and violent extremism			2
" @entity9 is known for his research on @entity173 relations and has been a vocal critic of the government 's ethnic policies in @entity14 , a resource - rich region long inhabited by the @entity178 - speaking @entity70			0
the arrival of waves of @entity71 , @entity1 's predominant ethnic group , over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions			2
some @entity70 have expressed resentment toward the @entity71 majority in recent years over what they describe as harsh treatment from @entity1 security forces and loss of economic opportunities to @entity71 people in @entity14			2
@entity124 has said @entity70 face widespread discrimination in employment , housing and education , as well as curtailed religious freedom			0
other critics , including exiled uyghur activists , have attributed the rise of violence in @entity14 to @entity11 's increasingly repressive rule there -- a claim the government vehemently denies .			0
