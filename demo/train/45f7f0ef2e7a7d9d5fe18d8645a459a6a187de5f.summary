@entity0 knows that sometimes it 's best to follow the light			1
the eldest of eight children , the @entity5 entrepreneur had a typical upbringing in the southern town of @entity10			1
one night , sitting out on his parents ' veranda , he spotted a mysterious light flashing atop nearby @entity14			2
he asked someone about it , who told him it was a radio transmitter			2
" i got very fascinated , " @entity0 recalls			1
a lifetime obsession was instantly born , setting the young boy on a path that would see him transmitting to millions of people every day and eventually becoming a major media mogul			2
high school and a diploma in journalism later and @entity27 found employment at @entity5 state radio @entity29			1
there , he produced a variety of shows but after seven years he left to set up his own company , which created adverts , features and documentaries for other radio stations			1
@entity0 's ambition would take him further ; first he was at the helm of his own station , @entity42 ( @entity5 's leading privately - owned station ) , and later on he successfully expanded into television			1
the process was arduous and required no small measure of perseverance			0
here , @entity0 tells @entity1 how he fought his way to the top , why it 's important to look back , and how ethics are at the core of his business			1
whilst running his production company , support from clients bolstered @entity27 's belief that he could go it alone and set up his own station			1
things did n't start well			0
" in 2002 i applied for a license and it was rejected twice			2
in 2003 i applied again [ but ] it was also rejected , " @entity0 says			1
in 2004 , and at the fourth attempt , he was granted a national broadcasting license			2
he was ready to go as soon as it arrived -- " by that time i had bought around three transmitters , " he cheekily admits			0
start small but always think big			0
" we started very , very simple , with very , very simple gadgets , " @entity0 explains			1
" when people [ came to ] the studios they were fascinated			0
' are you broadcasting to the whole country using these simple gadgets ? ' i said yes			0
" we continued , struggling , expanding			0
we started with five transmitting sites ... now we have i think over 34 - 35 transmitting sites across the country			0
" being the largest private radio station in @entity5 was not enough for @entity27			1
after nine years in radio he wanted a new challenge and decided to expand into television			1
" realizing the dream of running or owning a television station [ was ] a very , very difficult journey , " he says			1
" the day we switched on the television ... expecting that every moment , any second , we 're going to see a @entity42 signal ... i do n't know how to describe it ... it was a very , very emotional moment			2
" businesses should be ethical			1
@entity0 says @entity91 's mission was always clear			1
" from the onset we told ourselves that we are going to be a radio station that should be fair , balanced , ethical , professional and non-partisan			1
a station that was going to be one that everyone must trust			2
" i feel i have a personal responsibility as a broadcaster , as a journalist , to ensure that people are well informed			0
so they can make decisions about their future ; decisions about their lives			0
" everybody should have a voice in society			0
" [ radio ] is a very powerful tool that can change people 's lives , " @entity0 says			1
" it 's a voice , loaded with information			0
it 's a voice with content that can be used effectively to change how people think , to change [ the ] attitudes of the people , to change so many things			0
" @entity122 is now using his station to help others			2
in 2007 he introduced the @entity126 , recognizing the best female students in high schools			1
" i have always been a very strong believer that for us to move forward everybody must be included			0
and when i say everybody , this includes women			2
you can not talk about human rights without women rights			2
" " for us to develop as a country we need to make sure that we are not leaving our women behind , " @entity0 argues			1
the awards , which are now paired with international university scholarships are " empowering our women , " he says , " empowering our girls through education			1
" humble beginnings should not restrict you			0
" i did n't grow up with a lot of resources around me , " @entity0 explains			1
" i know the pains of sleeping with an empty stomach ... i know the pains of sleeping on a railway line without a blanket ... i know the pains of almost having nothing			0
" speaking of the media empire he has built , @entity27 is self - deprecating			0
" anybody can do this			0
i 'm like you ... wherever you are in [ your ] corner of the world , you can become someone			0
in the very small corner that you are , take off fear and believe in your idea			0
believe in your idea , work very hard , and make sure [ it ] is going to happen ... sometimes it can be very frustrating , sometimes you feel you are bashing a dry hard wall , sometimes people look at you like a crazy fellow , but just believe and keep on walking			0
