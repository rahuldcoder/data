-- @entity2 , work took place outside of the home during designated hours			2
today , that world is a fairy tale			0
if you checked your work email this @entity8 , you 're likely aware that at most companies there is an unspoken expectation that employees tend to emails at all hours			1
it would be easy to blame heartless managers or short - sighted ceos for the collapsing boundaries between work and life			1
but the causes of this cultural shift are far more complex			2
as @entity23 , we pride ourselves on hard work and self - sacrifice			1
as human beings , we thrive on feeling needed			0
neurologically , certain elements of work can be addictive			2
studies have found that satisfying curiosity about a novel event -- say , a new and unread email sitting in your inbox -- releases dopamine in the brain , which conditions us to check again and again			0
despite the monumental shift in the accessibility of work , organizations continue to offer employees the same advice they did before the invention of the @entity46 : seek work / life balance			1
the idea holds inherent appeal			2
too bad it 's a myth			1
for many of us , compartmentalizing our work and personal life is simply not possible , and not just because of the ubiquity of email			1
in a growing number of companies , work now involves collaborating with colleagues in different time zones , making the start and end of the workday a moving target			2
and even within organizations with more traditional hours , let 's face it -- standout employees are always working , even when they 're not attending conference calls or corresponding over email			2
they 're continuously plotting ahead and thinking up new ideas while showering , driving their kids to gymnastics , or drifting off to sleep			0
until we come to terms with the fact that separating work from home is a fantasy , we ca n't begin to have an intelligent conversation about what it means to create thriving organizations			2
we can bemoan the blending of our professional and personal lives , or alternatively , we can look for innovative solutions			0
for the past decade i have been studying the science of human motivation , paying particular attention to how people can work more effectively			2
over the course of reviewing thousands of academic articles for my book , i have repeatedly encountered a striking gap between the latest science and the realities of the modern workplace			0
take , for example , the degree of control employees at your company possess over when and where they work			1
we tend to assume that granting workers too much leeway will lead to reduced effort ; that employees will take advantage unless they are closely supervised			0
yet studies have repeatedly found that the opposite is true			0
providing employees with more control over their schedule -- to the extent that flexibility is possible -- motivates them to work harder , produce higher - quality work , and develop greater loyalty for their company			1
why is this the case ? for one thing , placing employees in control of their schedules encourages them to work during hours when they are most effective , instead of requiring them to sit comatose in front of a computer because it 's not yet 5 p.m. most adults function best in the first few hours after waking			1
others are sharper in the afternoon			0
flexible work schedules allow employees in both camps to leverage their best hours instead of conforming to an artificial eight - hour " shift " -- one that was originally designed to maximize the productivity of a factory , not human beings			1
studies also show that employees with flexible schedules work more intensely			1
it 's because as humans , we are motivated by a norm of reciprocity			0
when a manager grants us the freedom of a flexible schedule , we seek to " repay " that benefit by investing greater effort			0
productivity aside , flexible working offers another crucial benefit -- it allows employees to resolve critical personal matters when needed , so that they can bring sharper focus and clarity to their work			1
no wonder workplace flexibility has been linked with a host of positive well - being outcomes , including higher job satisfaction , lower stress , and reduced work - family conflict			1
we live in a world in which it is acceptable for work to interrupt personal time			0
and yet we 're not as comfortable when personal time interrupts work			0
why ? when organizations provide employees with a clear set of goals and entrust them to manage their time responsibly , making it acceptable for a worker to take an hour during the day to attend a yoga class , visit an elderly parent or welcome his or her child off the afternoon school bus , they generate commitment that ends up saving them money in the long term			1
just ask @entity188 , a successful outdoor clothing manufacturer			0
employees at the company 's @entity192 headquarters are empowered to set their own hours , given access to an on - site daycare and invited to take regular breaks during the day for exercise			1
company restrooms even include private showers , transforming the prospect of an afternoon jog from an aspiration fantasy into a practical option			0
the result ? over the past five years , @entity188 's profits have tripled , while employee turnover has dropped to a fraction of the industry average			0
as for employee satisfaction ? in the words of @entity214 , a 26 - year - old @entity188 product tester , " landing this job was probably the best thing that ever happened to me			1
i feel like i represent the brand as much as it represents me			0
" instead of endorsing the work - life balance myth , organizations are far better off empowering employees to integrate work and life , in ways that position them to succeed at both			1
ultimately , it is companies that are quickest to realize that it is in their financial interests to care for the entire employee -- not just the sliver of them that sits in the office for 40 hours a week -- that stand to gain the greatest benefits in the form of stronger loyalty , higher engagement , and top performance .			0

@entity238 : many people like the idea of work - life balance , but it 's a myth in @entity23
@entity238 : the 8 - hour shift , made for the days of factories , is an artificial construct
he says companies should provide employees with more control over schedules
@entity238 : flexible work times improve job satisfaction and lower stress
