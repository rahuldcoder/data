" @entity5 also owns a portion of the @entity24 's @entity23 and founded , with @entity25 , the clothing line @entity26			1
@entity5 spoke with @entity6 about his father , his anger and his old life			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			1
@entity6 : when you were 5 , your family moved to the @entity36 -- and then your father left when you were 11			1
when you look back at that , what did your 11 - year - old self feel ? @entity5 : anger			1
because when you 're growing up , your dad is your superhero			1
once you 've let yourself fall that in love with someone , once you put him on such a high pedestal and he lets you down , you never want to experience that pain again			2
so i remember just being really quiet and really cold			2
never wanting to let myself get close to someone like that again			2
i carried that feeling throughout my life , until my father and i met up before he died			1
i 've never heard a man phrase it that way			2
you know , i 've done many shows about divorce , and the real crime is when the kids are n't told			2
they just wake up one day and their dad is gone			2
did that happen to you ? @entity5 : we were told our parents would separate , but the reasons were n't explained			1
my mom prepared us more than he did			2
i do n't think he was ready for that level of discussion and emotion			2
he was a guy who was pretty detached from his feelings			2
@entity6 : did you wonder why he left ? @entity5 : i summed it up that they were n't getting along			1
there was a lot of arguing			2
@entity6 : and did you know you were angry ? @entity5 : yeah			1
i also felt protective of my mom			2
i remember telling her , " do n't worry , when i get big , i 'm going to take care of this			2
" i felt like i had to step up			2
i was 11 years old , right ? but i felt i had to make the situation better			2
@entity6 : how did that change you ? @entity5 : it made me not express my feelings as much			1
i was already a shy kid , and it made me a little reclusive			2
but it also made me independent			2
it was a weird juxtaposition			2
@entity6 : i 've read that when you were 12 , you shot your brother in the shoulder			2
did your father 's leaving have anything to do with that ? did it turn you into the kind of angry kid who would end up shooting his brother ? @entity5 : yes -- and my brother was dealing with a lot of demons			1
@entity6 : how old was he ? @entity5 : about 16			1
he was doing a lot of drugs			2
he was taking stuff from our family			2
i was the youngest , but i felt like i needed to protect everybody			0
@entity6 : so how did you get back in touch with your father ? @entity5 : my mom set up a meeting			1
and now i realize why -- it makes all the sense in the world			0
i remember very distinctly that i had a conversation with her in my kitchen			0
i was saying , " you know , @entity130 , i 've really been trying to look inward , and maybe i 'm just not meant to fall in love like other people do			0
" she just looked at me like , " hush up , boy			0
@entity5 : and i guess from that point , she figured out what was wrong with me , and she planned a meeting between me and my father			1
i was like , " @entity130 , i 'm a grown man			0
i do n't need a dad now			0
" @entity6 : you did n't feel a hole in your soul ? @entity5 : i never looked at that			1
i guess i did n't want to deal with it			0
because , you know , once i looked , i 'd have to do something about it			0
and i guess i still had too much resentment and anger			0
@entity6 : in one of your songs , you wrote that you were n't sure if your father even remembered your birthday is in december			1
@entity5 : i believed that			1
when i was a kid , i once waited for him on a bench			0
even as an adult , that affected me			0
so when my mom set up this meeting , i told her he would n't come -- and the first time , he did n't			0
at that point , i was really done , but @entity163 pushed for another meeting , because she 's just a beautiful soul			0
@entity6 : the second time , your father showed up			1
@entity5 : he showed up			1
and i gave him the real conversation			0
i told him how i felt the day he left			0
he was saying stuff like " man , you knew where i was			0
" i 'm like , " i was a kid ! do you realize how wrong you were ? it was your responsibility to see me			0
" he finally accepted that			0
@entity6 : where had he been ? @entity5 : at his mom 's house 10 minutes away from me			1
that was the sad part			0
@entity6 : was there any explanation he could have offered that would have satisfied you ? @entity5 : yes -- and that 's why we were able to mend our relationship			1
@entity6 : what was his reason ? @entity5 : when i was 9 , my dad 's brother got stabbed , and my dad went looking for the guy who did it			1
people would call in the middle of the night and tell him , " so - and - so is out here			0
" so my dad would get up , get his gun , and go outside to look for the guy			0
after a while , my mom was like , " hey , this is your family now			0
you ca n't do that			0
" but this was my dad 's baby brother			0
and my dad was in so much pain that he started using drugs and became a different person			0
so i understand that the trauma of the event , coupled with the drugs , caused him to lose his soul			0
@entity6 : when you saw him again , had he come back to himself ? @entity5 : he was broken			1
he had a bad liver , and he knew that if he continued drinking , it would kill him			0
but he did n't stop			0
@entity6 : how soon after you saw him did he die ? @entity5 : a couple of months			1
i got him an apartment , i was buying furniture			0
@entity6 : did you instantly make peace with him during that conversation ? @entity5 : pretty much			1
@entity6 : the conversation freed you in ways that you had n't been free before ? @entity5 : one hundred percent			1
@entity6 : did it open the door for you to have a life with love in it ? @entity5 : absolutely			1
@entity6 : so what 's your personal creed ? @entity5 : be true to yourself -- and keep things simple			1
@entity6 : my creed is that intention creates reality			0
@entity5 : now i 'm having an aha moment ! that 's true			1
@entity0 : the top 20 things @entity6 knows for sure @entity6 : what 's the basis of your spiritual belief ? @entity5 : i believe in karma : what you do to others comes back to you			1
@entity6 : but do n't you think we 're responsible only for what we know ? otherwise , you 'd be facing karma for every person you sold drugs to			1
@entity5 : as a kid , i did n't know any better			1
but now , if i were to act as if what i did was n't bad , that would be irresponsible			0
and i 'd have to bear the weight of that			0
@entity6 : @entity265 always says , " when you know better , you do better			0
" do you still think back on that time in your life ? @entity5 : all the time			1
when you make music , you 're constantly on the psychiatrist 's couch , so to speak			0
that 's an outlet for me			0
because i 'm not normally a talkative person			0
i do n't have conversations like this for no reason			0
