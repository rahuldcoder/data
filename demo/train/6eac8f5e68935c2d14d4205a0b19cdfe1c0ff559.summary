-- six - time former major champion @entity1 said that big questions surrounding the future of @entity4 still remain despite the world no. 1 apologizing for his " irresponsible and selfish behavior " in a public statement on friday			1
the apology from @entity9 -- which was broadcast around the world from the headquarters of the @entity12 in @entity13 -- was the first public statement from the golfer since the 34 - year - old admitted to " transgressions " following a @entity19 car crash			1
however , in an exclusive interview with @entity0 , @entity1 said the comments had done little to answer key questions : " it was a pretty complete apology and very embarrassing for him , to take the world stage and to apologize for what he has been up to			1
" " however , he still left the big question that we as golfers all wanted to know , and that 's when he will come back to the course			1
@entity4 has only delayed the hard questions that will surely follow " instead he 's decided to head back to therapy -- which i find difficult to understand as this man had an extremely strong mind on the the golf course			1
" i assume he 's paying the bill as i ca n't believe that a man in a white coat would be telling @entity4 what to do , " @entity1 added			1
@entity1 , who won the @entity44 on three occasions , added that @entity4 faced a " long road " back to the top of the game			1
" he is the center of attention -- there 's so much talk and gossip behind his back [ now ] , none of it very pretty			2
to come back now knowing that so many people are talking behind his back ... it will take a long road [ as ] he 's asking for the world to like him again			0
" he seems like he is going to put the barriers up -- he wants it completely private			0
all the leading pr experts would say that he needs to face the music and you need to get it over and done with , but @entity4 wants it his way			2
but the bottom line is it stills looks like a long road to get him back on the golf course			0
" @entity73 : players react positively @entity75 , a major @entity4 sponsor , reacted to his remarks with the following statement : " @entity4 has apologized and made his position clear			1
@entity75 fully supports him and his family			1
we look forward to him returning to golf			0
" elsewhere , @entity12 commissioner @entity84 told @entity0 that @entity4 ' words contained a message of good news after some months of bad headlines			2
" the good news from today is that one , he plans to return to golf ; two , it could be by the end of the year , and three , he 's taking the right steps to return			0
all of that pleases us a great deal			0
" in response to the criticism @entity4 faced over refusing to take questions at the press conference , @entity84 said : " i do n't know the extent to which the media will allow him the opportunity to return in the way he wants			2
hopefully we can maintain the decorum we have had at our tournament in the past , and we 'd ask golf fans to react positively to his requests			0
" fellow golfer @entity110 sent his message of reaction via his @entity114 account : " the biggest major @entity4 is going to win now -- is going to keep his family and i hope he succeeds ! i wish him all the best ! @entity116			1
" earlier in the day , @entity118 golfer @entity117 said in a press conference at the @entity120 in @entity121 : " i 'm looking forward to seeing him back on the tour , seeing him play , that 's what we love doing			0
other than that , i 'm not really worried about the rest			0
" fellow @entity131 and world no. 11 @entity129 agreed : " the sooner he comes out to tell us all when he 's going to be coming back to play golf -- great			2
we all want to see him back on the golf course as soon as possible			0
