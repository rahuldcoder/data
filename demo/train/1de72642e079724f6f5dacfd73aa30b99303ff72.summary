@entity1 , @entity0 -- a common perception among many who have followed the recent banking and stock market crises is that the big financial players have been reckless , splashing large amounts of other people 's money on half - understood , risky schemes			1
go on , take a risk -- it might be good for the economy			0
but a pioneering business school study -- which , perhaps uniquely in it 's field , gathered data inside a @entity19 casino -- now suggests precisely opposite			1
indeed , in many parts of the economy the problem could be that people are simply being too cautious , the authors surmise			2
the paper , which has the catchy title , " @entity27 in @entity19 : evidence from @entity38 , " was produced by @entity28 and @entity29 , both finance professors at @entity33 's @entity32 school and @entity36 's @entity35 school respectively			1
they studied more than 4,300 hands of blackjack played for real at a @entity19 casino -- more than $ 120,000 changed hands -- and uncovered what psychologists call an omission bias ; that is , players being more conservative in their bets than the level which would have optimized winnings			1
mostly , such studies of risk are carried out in laboratory conditions where , both figuratively and literally , the stakes are lower			0
" as we point out in the paper , blackjack is a great venue to study how people behave during risky situations , " @entity28 told @entity2			1
" what is striking is that they often play too conservatively , even though they have voluntarily accepted a role in a risky game			0
" @entity38 was the ideal pursuit to use as a testing ground as it is widely acknowledged that players are at the tables to maximize gain			2
equally important , with bets being made before decisions are made , the strategy pursued is not shaped by a shifting level of exposure to potential loss or gain			0
the study 's key finding was that passive strategy errors , in which players fail to take the right action , were four times more common than mistakes in which they did something that was not necessary			1
crucially , " passive mistakes " -- players failing to take the necessary action -- were on average one third more financially costly than mistakes caused by overconfidence			2
the paper also found evidence for what was termed a " rebound effect " -- that an error made by playing aggressively was more likely than average to be followed in the next round by a passive error			0
the authors were at pains to rule out other factors that could affect the outcomes , such as card counting strategies , or players simply getting confused			1
on the latter point , the authors found that more complex hands were no more likely to prompt errors of omission			2
inexperience was also eliminated -- in fact , small - stakes gamblers , perceived as more likely to be newcomers , made fewer errors of caution than those betting higher			0
but can any wider lessons really be drawn ? as the paper notes : " perhaps few decisions of economic consequence are made at a blackjack table			1
" nonetheless , it argues , the same risk - versus - inaction decision is present in many areas of business and economics			0
" we can extrapolate our findings to investment decisions , insurance choices , and savings choices in the general public , " @entity28 said			0
" many of these people are not seeking risk and probably exhibit what we find in a more profound way			0

business school study examined blackjack players at @entity19 casino
@entity145 was that losses came more from *over-caution* than recklessness
authors believe lessons could be *expanded* to business world
