a @entity1 sperm donor caught in the middle of a child support case says he wanted to help a lesbian couple when he made the donation nearly five years ago			1
instead , he may end up paying for his action			0
a judge ruled that @entity9 must pay child support , even though he says he signed documents waiving his parental rights			1
@entity15 district court judge @entity14 said on wednesday that @entity9 failed to conform to @entity1 law , which says a licensed physician must be involved in an artificial insemination process , court documents show			1
the documents show that the lesbian couple whom @entity9 helped conceive a child say they performed the artificial insemination procedure at home			1
' i donated genetic material , and that was it ' this story begins on @entity29 in march 2009			1
that was when @entity9 noticed an advertisement from the @entity33 couple , seeking donated sperm			1
" intrigued " by the ad , he says , he delivered three cupfuls of his sperm -- gratis -- to the women			1
one of the women gave birth to a daughter in december 2009 , according to court documents			1
" i donated genetic material , and that was it for me , " he told @entity45 affiliate @entity43			2
that changed when the parents separated and one of the women stopped working because of illness and applied to the state for help , he said			0
the state contacted @entity9 for child support			1
@entity1 officials were not persuaded by what @entity9 says were agreements he signed , before making his donations , that he would assume no financial responsibility for the child , who is now 4 years old			1
the @entity65 said any agreement would not apply because a physician did not perform the insemination			1
@entity9 said that was news to him			2
" i did n't know that there was no doctor involved , " he said			1
lawyer blames political motivations his lawyer , @entity74 , accused the state , where same - sex marriage is not legal , of being politically motivated in its pursuit of his client			0
" the cost to the state to bring this case far outweighs any benefit the state would get , " said @entity74 , adding his client has no other children			0
@entity74 said the state is asking for $ 4,000 to recoup the money it has spent			0
it is also asking @entity9 to pay child support , which could run into tens of thousands of dollars , he said			2
@entity74 said the @entity1 court has failed to address many of the challenges brought forward by @entity9 , under the guise of statutory interpretation of the law requiring the donor sperm to be provided to a licensed physician			1
" from a very narrowly crafted statute , the court has made a very broad rule -- that is the issue , " @entity74 said			0
@entity74 said he planned to appeal the decision			0
@entity9 : " i 'm not her parent " @entity9 said he met the child once -- a few months ago -- when he and his wife by chance crossed paths with one of the girl 's parents at an area carnival			2
he said he had no intention of assuming a paternal role			0
" i 'm not her parent , " he said			0
but under @entity1 law , he is her father			2
had a physician carried out the insemination , that would not be the case , because @entity9 would be able to document that he was a sperm donor and not the lover of the girl 's mother , @entity45 senior medical correspondent @entity116 said			1
" for all they know , they were lovers , " she said			0
" they need that documentation			0
he 's the dad ; he ought to be paying up			0
" though a physician would have tested the sperm for sexually transmitted diseases and certain genetic disorders , there are disincentives associated with going through a physician			0
a single attempt at artificial insemination costs about $ 3,000 , and sometimes several tries are needed			1
" it 's a lot cheaper to get someone to come on over with their donation , and then do it yourself at home , " @entity116 said			0
meanwhile , @entity9 owes legal fees and has taken his story to the news media			2
" if enough noise gets made about it , at this point , maybe things will change for the better , " he said			0
asked whether , knowing what he now knows , he would answer the advertisement again , @entity9 said , " probably not			2
" a different kind of fatherhood			0

@entity9 answered a @entity29 ad from a lesbian couple seeking donated sperm
the couple say they performed artificial insemination at home , court documents show
@entity9 says he signed an agreement to waive his parental rights
but a @entity1 agency says the agreement is n't valid because a doctor was n't involved
