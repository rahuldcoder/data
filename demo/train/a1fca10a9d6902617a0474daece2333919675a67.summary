-- the furor over @entity2 has died down some now that the former @entity4 football coach has been convicted of serial child sexual abuse			1
but for @entity7 , a sportscaster for the @entity8 , the backlash continues			1
not that @entity7 has done anything wrong			1
his only offense is that he shares the same name with the man who preyed on young boys and who was convicted on 45 counts related to child sex abuse			0
take a look at recent postings on @entity7 's @entity20 page			1
a woman named @entity22 wrote " @ @entity23 you 're a disgusting vile human			1
" @entity2 responded : " wrong guy			1
i 'm @entity7 with a @entity27 @entity8 sportscaster			1
no relation to the former @entity30 coach who spells his name with a @entity32 " another person tweeted : " hope you get knifed in prison			0
" another asked : " @ gerrysandusky i 'm just confused ... why would you do such things to children ? # mean " @entity2 said he received thousands of these messages			1
and he is trying to stay patient			0
" the general consensus is people inviting me to an extended stay in hell , or a miserable death or prison rape , " @entity2 said			1
" i received a lot of f - bombs			2
i can understand the confusion			0
it is an emotional , heinous crime			0
i can understand the reactions			0
you just have to keep a sense of humor with this			0
" @entity2 said he knew he would be in for a tough time back in november when the @entity56 first broke			1
the sports announcer said he was riding in the team bus as the @entity8 were on their way to play the @entity60			2
everybody on the team bus was chatting and many were shooting stares at him			0
@entity2 went to see what all the commotion was about and then quickly realized he would be forever tied to one the most salacious sports scandals of all time			1
" i thought to myself this was not going to go away for awhile , " @entity2 said			1
the attacks and negative messages started right after the news broke , they intensified during the trial and got even worse after the verdict			2
@entity2 changed his biography on his @entity20 page to say " i am @entity7 with a @entity27 @entity8 sportscaster			1
no relation to the former @entity4 coach			0
" but that did not stop the attacks			0
@entity84 from @entity85 was one of the many who sent @entity2 a nasty tweet			2
" at first glance i thought it was him			0
in my mind @entity2 is a sick animal and should n't be here , " said the 21 - year - old who did not want his last name used because he feels bad about what he wrote on @entity20			2
" i definitely feel for the guy			0
i respect his work in sports , but he needs to change his name because people are going to keep messing with him			0
" @entity2 said he is not going to change his name , and he refuses to let the other infamous @entity2 hijack the brand he has built working in sports for more than 30 years			1
in fact , @entity2 said he interviewed the other @entity2 early in his career in 1987 when he worked at a @entity106 television station			2
he went to the @entity107 when the @entity108 played @entity4 and interviewed @entity2 for about 10 minutes			2
" he seemed normal like any other football coach , " said @entity2			2
" i did a little novelty story about our names being the same			0
little did i know that 30 years later that name thing would cause so much trouble for me			0
