-- under a blazing sun in early june , a group of @entity3 rebels in eastern @entity4 were digging amid pine woods near the town of @entity8			1
their grizzled commander was a bearded man in his 50s who would not tell us where he was from , but acknowledged that he was n't local			0
he was proud to show off his unit 's most prized possession -- a truck - mounted anti-aircraft unit that was @entity16 - made			1
he told us the weapon had been seized from a @entity19 base			2
a few miles away , in the town of @entity22 , rebel fighters displayed two combat engineering tanks they said they had seized them from a local factory			0
@entity4 has long been a center of weapons production			1
they had parked one of the tanks next to the town square			0
these were just two instances of how the rebels in eastern @entity4 were steadily adding more sophisticated weapons to their armory , including tanks , multiple rocket launchers -- and anti-aircraft systems			1
in early june , they began to target @entity19 planes and helicopters , with some success			1
the day after we met the commander in the pine woods , an @entity43 transport plane was brought down over nearby @entity47			0
several @entity49 and @entity50 helicopters were also hit in this period , as was an @entity53 cargo plane near @entity54 -- it is about the size of a passenger jet			0
forty - nine military personnel were killed when the @entity53 crashed short of the airport			0
for the most part , these aircraft were flying at relatively low altitudes , and were targeted by shoulder - launched @entity64 missiles and anti-aircraft guns			1
the @entity3 rebels had taken control of several @entity19 military depots and bases and stripped them of their weapons			1
the @entity64 was standard @entity73 issue			0
relatively easy to operate , it is effective to altitudes of some 2,500 meters ( 8,000 feet )			0
but it and @entity77 23 - 2 anti-aircraft batteries , which rebel units also obtained , are a world away from the @entity81 or " @entity84 " system that seems increasingly likely to have been used to shoot down @entity83 on thursday			2
stealing a @entity84 could the @entity3 rebels have acquired a serviceable @entity81 from a @entity19 base and operated it ? the evidence is circumstantial ; a great deal of @entity19 military hardware is in poor condition or redundant			1
but on june 29 , rebels raided the @entity19 army 's @entity93 missile facility near @entity95			1
photographs show them examining what they found			0
the @entity16 website @entity99 ran an article the same day titled " skies of @entity95 will be defended by surface - to - air missile system @entity81			2
" the article claimed : " the anti-air defense point is one of the divisions of the missile corps and is equipped with motorized " @entity84 " anti-aircraft missile systems			0
" @entity110 , an expert on former @entity73 military hardware at @entity112 , says that " the @entity84 is in both the @entity16 and @entity19 inventories , but it 's unclear whether the one suspected in the shoot - down was taken by rebels when they overran a @entity19 base , or was supplied by @entity16			1
" he told @entity0 that the @entity84 " would normally operate with a separate radar that picks up the overall air picture			0
this was almost certainly not the case with @entity123 , " making it more difficult to identify the target and track its course			0
among the @entity3 rebels are fighters who served in the @entity16 army			1
it is possible that some were familiar with the @entity84 , but @entity110 agrees with the @entity132 and @entity19 assessment that @entity16 expertise would have been needed to operate it			1
" the system needs a crew of about four who know what they 're doing			0
to operate the @entity84 correctly , @entity16 assistance would have been required unless the rebel operators were defected air defense operators - which is unlikely			1
" it is now the " working theory " in the @entity132 intelligence community that the @entity16 military supplied a @entity84 surface - to - air missile system to the rebels , a senior @entity132 defense official told @entity0 friday			1
@entity16 has denied that any equipment in service with the @entity16 armed forces has crossed the border into @entity4			1
and @entity154 , the self - described prime minister of the @entity155 , said saturday his forces did not have weapons capable of striking an aircraft at such a high altitude			2
but someone in the border region where eastern @entity4 meets @entity16 has been using an advanced anti-air missile system			1
late wednesday , the day before @entity123 was presumably hit , a @entity19 air force @entity164 combat jet was shot down close to the border with @entity16			1
the @entity167 told @entity0 that the plane was flying at 6,200 - 6,500 meters ( about 21,000 feet ) and was hit near a town called @entity170 , which is only some 30 kilometers ( 20 miles ) from where @entity83 was hit and 15 kilometers ( 10 miles ) from the border with @entity16			1
the @entity19 military alleged the missile had been fired from @entity16 territory			1
it was the first time that a combat jet flying at high speed had been hit and came two days after an @entity43 -- flying at a similar altitude in the same area -- was shot down further north , in the @entity54 area			2
smuggling on the black roads the @entity183 said friday that weapons could not be smuggled across the border " secretly			2
by early june , rebels controlled several crossings along a stretch of border more than 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) long			2
the border area is open farmland that was neither patrolled regularly nor even marked in many places			2
dozens of unmonitored tracks known as black roads -- because they have been used for smuggling -- cross the border			0
additionally , the @entity19 border guard service was in disarray after an attack on its command center in @entity54 early in june			1
on the road east toward the border through the town of @entity207 there was no sign of a @entity19 military or police presence			1
the @entity3 rebels had already begun to bring across heavy weapons at that point			2
a @entity0 team visited the border post at @entity217 in june , soon after a five - hour firefight involving border guards and members of the self - declared @entity221 of rebels who had been trying to bring over two @entity16 armored personnel carriers			1
they had been abandoned during the battle			0
the unknowns are these : just how much weaponry has been brought in from @entity16 , how was it obtained , and did it include the @entity84 ? in june , the @entity229 claimed that three @entity231 tanks , several rocket launchers and other military vehicles had crossed the @entity16 border			1
@entity4 made similar accusations , saying the weapons had gone to @entity237 , a rebel stronghold close to where @entity123 came down			1
the @entity229 said the tanks had been in storage in south - west @entity16 , suggesting collusion between the @entity16 authorities -- at some level -- and the rebels			2
it said at the time that the equipment held at the storage site also included " multiple rocket launchers , artillery , and air defense systems			0
" it added , notably , that " more advanced air defense systems have also arrived at this site			0
" @entity253 rejected the claims as fake			0
@entity256 has also released satellite images which , it said , showed tanks in the @entity260 region in @entity16 early in june , before they were taken to eastern @entity4			1
the tanks had no markings			0
even so , some experts , such as @entity264 at @entity266 's @entity265 , say the evidence is largely circumstantial			0
@entity256 's images did not show the tanks actually crossing into @entity4			2
wherever they came from , @entity16 language websites soon featured calls for people with military skills to call a number associated with the separatist @entity155 if they could help operate or maintain the tanks			0
one answered , " i served in the military engineering academy ... and am a former commander in the intelligence			0
" but the separatists ' greatest vulnerability was always from the air			0
the @entity19 had already shown , in driving them away from the @entity95 airport at the end of may , that they could use airpower to devastating effect			0
and they had begun to fly at higher altitudes to avoid shoulder - launched missiles			0
to hold what remained of their territory , the @entity3 rebels needed to be able to challenge @entity19 dominance of the skies			2
whether they received help from across the border to do so , and in what way , is the question that governments around the world want answered .			0

rebels have downed @entity19 planes flying at high altitudes
a *pro-russian* rebel commander shows off anti-aircraft missiles
the border region with @entity16 is very porous , *unguarded* in many places
some contend that larger weapons have come into @entity4 from @entity16
