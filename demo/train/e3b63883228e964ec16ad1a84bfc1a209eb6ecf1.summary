-- " cartoons are about doom and disaster -- and you do n't get more doom and disaster than in a @entity10 prisoner of war camp , " says @entity0 , the man uniquely hailed as the world 's greatest yachting cartoonist			1
as a teenage illustrator from the @entity14 mining town of @entity15 , @entity0 was captured by @entity17 @entity10 forces while drawing maps of the north @entity20 desert for the @entity21			1
yet amid the horrors of his prison camp - the 91 - year - old recalls eating @entity26 guard dogs that had been clubbed to death - @entity0 carved a unique space for laughter by drawing wry , darkly humorous cartoons			1
published in a prisoner - run newspaper , the drawings poked fun at camp life , offering @entity0 a distraction from the everyday brutality and his fellow inmates a rare source of joy			1
they would also spark the beginnings of a career spanning seven decades , more than 20 books and the birth of an unusual new genre in illustration - nautical cartooning			2
it 's a genre that @entity0 has dominated for 70 years , amassing followers across the world with his trademark , roughly scribbled drawings of rain - sodden sailors naively headed for impending doom			1
if the leap from a 1942 prison camp to hopeless yachtsmen lost at sea seems huge , @entity0 has the answer : " the secret to cartoons is you always need something going wrong			1
" following the war , the then 24 - year - old continued sketching his droll observations of everyday life			1
but it was n't until @entity0 bought a boat in his late 20s , setting up a business offering charter cruises , that he began to turn his illustrations to sailing			1
now a retrospective of his work - " @entity74 " - published this week , features 150 of his favorite sketches			2

" @entity0 has reached the point now where he is going blind , " @entity82 , publishing director at @entity83 , said			2
" it seemed such a cruel disability for a cartoonist to have their eyesight shot down			0
so we asked @entity0 to put together his best cartoons for a final retrospective			1
" having been published in a plethora of @entity14 magazines ranging from @entity95 to the @entity96 , @entity0 admitted it was a huge undertaking whittling down his immense collection of work			2
@entity100 paid tribute to the man who began drawing for them in the 1950s , claiming he had " seen off more editors than anyone else at the magazine			0
" it added : " his sharp eye and satire often contrasts with a softer , gentler approach when the subject warrants it			0
" but it is among sailing enthusiasts that @entity0 's name brings most smiles			2
as @entity82 explained : " @entity0 is synonymous with nautical cartoons			2
" " he is on a pinnacle all on his own -- @entity0 is the one yachting cartoonist people think of			1
he 's got a unique skill of seeing the funny side in a typical situation -- whether it 's people huddling under waterproof gear or wives looking forlornly out the window as they lose their husbands to sailing in the snow on christmas day , " she said			0
" there 's no one who can touch him , both because he 's been going for 70 years and because he 's been so prolific over that period			0
" before @entity0 , there simply were no yachting cartoonists , she argued : " he blazed a trail			2
there was humorous writing around sailing but up until the war it was still quite an elitist pastime , which people took very seriously			0
" it 's quite hard to keep humor going year after year			0
but that 's @entity0 's skill			2
those everyday sailing mishaps such as tweaking bits of rope or relying on the weather strike a chord with people all over the world			0
" after the war @entity0 pursued his love of drawing , heading to @entity155 where he met future wife and now successful children 's author @entity157			1
the penniless newlyweds spent their honeymoon sleeping rough across @entity161 , paying their way by collecting waste paper en route			0
" i reckon i am the only bride that ever had to collect salvage in @entity171 to earn her fare back across the @entity173 , " @entity157 recalls in @entity166 's autobiography on @entity0 , titled -- naturally enough - " @entity167			1
" returning to the @entity14 , the couple set up home in rural @entity176 on the @entity177			0
but instead of spending their hard - earned savings on renovating their dilapidated cottage as planned , @entity0 bought a boat -- much to his wife 's dismay			1
his reason ? " you ca n't sail a house , " he told @entity11			0
when not drawing , the father - of - two worked as a sailor ; taking out charter parties , racing boats and delivering yachts everywhere from @entity193 to the @entity194			0
" i did n't have to think up cartoons -- i saw them happen			0
they 're all based on real life , " he said			0
" i remember years ago i thought i 'd run out of ideas			0

" the world 's greatest yachting cartoonist , " @entity0 , began career in @entity10 *pow* camp
the 91 - year - old says the secret to cartoons is " something going wrong "
forced to give up drawing after gradually going blind
new retrospective book , " the world of @entity0 , " will be last
