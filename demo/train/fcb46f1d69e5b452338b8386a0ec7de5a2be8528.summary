-- the @entity2 distributor of an @entity4 film about a group of @entity7 women soul singers has apologized for a dvd cover which critics have labeled sexist and racist			1
" @entity17 , " a feel - good hit in @entity4 , told the story of an all - women aboriginal soul group in the 1960s who overcome racism at home to forge a successful career			0
but the cover art for the @entity2 release of the dvd , distributed by @entity23 , has drawn a storm of criticism for the way it relegates the film 's four @entity7 women actors to the background , their skin tones rendered a muted blue , and places the white male actor who plays their manager in the foreground			1
the manager is played by @entity37 actor @entity36 , the best known of the film 's actors , who has a rising profile in @entity41 on the back of performances in hits including " bridesmaids			1
" on the cover of the @entity4 release of the dvd , @entity36 receives equal prominence with his co-stars , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			2
@entity23 said in a statement that it " regrets any unintentional upset " caused by the dvd , which was released in the @entity2 tuesday			0
" new cover art is being considered for future replenishment orders , " the statement said			2

movies about black women are even rarer			0
and now we 're gon na pretend the movies about women , whatever their color , are n't even about them at all ?

@entity36 also weighed in to the debate about the cover art. " it 's ridiculous , it 's misleading , it 's ill - judged , insensitive and everything the film was n't , " he wrote , in a tweet that was later deleted			0
but others felt the anger over the cover art was misplaced			0
@entity97 , national film editor for @entity4 's @entity98 , wrote that the campaign over the cover art was " misguided , " arguing that leveraging @entity36 's profile was " unquestionably the best shot the @entity2 distributors have of finding an audience for ' @entity17 '			1
