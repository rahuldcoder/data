-- official @entity1 , still stuck in the government shutdown of its own making , seems exceedingly short on wisdom these days			1
but maybe it is looking in the wrong places for answers			0
maybe , for one example , there is an unexpected lesson of sorts to be found in the history of baseball			2
that sport , which is currently moving through its postseason and toward the @entity17 , is hardly without it own troubles ; it has endured its share of shutdowns , strikes and lockouts			0
it was during one of those work stoppages -- the seven - week strike of 1981 -- that an anguished fan pleaded publicly with the leaders of the sport , both the owners and the players , to come to their senses			1
the fan was @entity32 , who at the time was the president of @entity34 and who would go on to become the commissioner of @entity37			1
@entity32 , frustrated by the posturing and excuses on both sides , wrote that the failure to open up the gates of the ballparks was " utter foolishness			1
... the people of @entity46 care about baseball , not about your squalid little squabbles			1
reassume your dignity and remember that you are the temporary custodians of an enduring public trust			1
the squalid little squabbles that have gummed up the daily machinery of the federal government have laid bare a stark truth : the unwillingness of leaders of both parties to get past their desire to portray themselves solely as winners , and those on the other side solely as losers			1
that the majority of the public -- the employers of these officials -- want the government to open back up seems to have mattered little to those entrusted with the authority to open it			1
the politicians ' belated nervous scrambling of the last few days , prompted by the citizens ' disdain , has only highlighted how badly they overestimated the limits of the country 's patience			0
during political campaign seasons , candidates , both @entity80 and @entity81 , love to proclaim : " this election is n't about me			0
" that thought tends to evaporate after the election is won			0
the @entity88 and the @entity89 have been acting as if the wishes of the citizens to get the government operating again are an irritating distraction from what the political leaders are most focused on : stubbornly and frantically shifting the blame to the other guy			2
if @entity102 proclaimed that " the buck stops here , " the people in charge in the @entity101 , the @entity98 and the @entity89 seem resolved to continually bleat : " the buck stops there			0
" it is all someone else 's fault			0
and the public is supposed to accept that			0
if it were federal workers , instead of the elected leaders of the federal government , who had made the decision to close down buildings , parks , programs and services , they could expect to be in dire trouble			1
president @entity122 , when federal air traffic controllers walked off their jobs in 1981 , said : " government can not close down the assembly line			1
it has to provide without interruption the protective services which are government 's reason for being			2
" but when it is the elected officials themselves who close down the assembly line , they expect the citizens to understand			0
every moment the political leaders have spent preening before the cameras has been a moment they were not working to reopen the government			2
there is a stirring sentence in the creed of the @entity146 : " i do not advertise the nature of my work , nor seek recognition for my actions			0
" it is as if the men and women in charge in @entity1 have adopted the mirror opposite of that code			2
@entity158 wrote , in the midst of that 1981 strike : " there is no general sympathy for either of your sides			1
" the sooner that the leaders of government -- the " temporary custodians of an enduring public trust " -- fully comprehend that there is , and will be , no general sympathy heading their way , either , the sooner they may realize that it 's time to step away from the television cameras and cease their futile search for that sympathy			1
and instead do the jobs they are being paid to do			0
how have you been affected by the shutdown ? share your story			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

@entity186 : @entity1 pols should heed words of then - future @entity37 chief @entity32 during 1981 strike
@entity32 said public not *interested* in baseball 's " squalid little squabbles "
@entity186 : government leaders should be keepers of public trust
@entity186 : if federal workers shut down government , there *'d* be an *uproar*
