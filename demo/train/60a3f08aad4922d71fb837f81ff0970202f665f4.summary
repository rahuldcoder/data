-- once again , the streets are electric with anger after a white police officer evades charges for fatally shooting a black man			1
sirens screech and wood batons push back marchers protesting from @entity9 to @entity10 to @entity11			2
this time the cadence of " no justice , no peace " has been replaced with " @entity15			2
" but there was another sign raised above the crowd in a recent protest in @entity10 : " doing nothing with saying nothing			0
" the mathematics of this one are clear			0
something 's got ta give			0
a loose network led by @entity26 in the film and arts world has emerged from the fog of tear gas to call for a quiet riot in response : a boycott of @entity35 shopping			1
@entity36 , who directed the 2013 film about police brutality called " @entity39 , " told us he was confounded by the eruptions of " human rights violations committed by public servants			1
" " there are three ways you can express yourself , " @entity36 said			0
you can choose how you spend your money that goes to @entity51 's corporations that hold a lot of power			1
" " we 've got to fight the powers that be ! " proclaimed @entity55 's @entity54 in 1989			0
with the embers of @entity59 still smoldering , it is clear that the struggle continues			1
but by taking their purchasing power away on retailers ' favorite day of the year , the voice of blacks in @entity51 , and their allies , may echo more loudly in its absence from shopping malls and big box stores			1
earning less than whites and unemployed at more than double the national average , @entity26 still have $ 1 trillion in buying power , according to @entity72			1
they spend more on media , watch more television , shop more frequently off and online and spend more on beauty products than any other ethnic group in the country			0
people who make movies also have sway -- people such as @entity85 , director of the upcoming film " @entity92 " and actors @entity88 ( " @entity90 " ) and @entity89 ( " @entity91 " )			2
# @entity93 has even produced its own minifilms to fuel this modern version of the bus boycotts			0
one of them features an interview with the daughter of @entity100 , who describes losing her father to police violence			1
@entity100 was choked to death by police who suspected he might be selling " loosies " or loose cigarettes			2
in his grand jury testimony , @entity59 officer @entity108 said the man he shot to death , @entity110 , might have been suspected of stealing " cigarillos " at a convenience store			1
our own contribution to this tragically revived conversation is the @entity117 documentary " @entity118 "			0
it includes @entity100 's story and other shocking videos and stories of police brutality			1
the # @entity93 videos alone make the case for change			2
" social media and the technology , with respect to camera phones , empowers every single person who has access to a device , " @entity89 told us			0
these are the kind of media people could be watching ahead of @entity35 , rather than falling prey to commercial plugs to shop			1
the outcry over police brutality ca n't end with the @entity143 news cycle			1
president @entity144 ca n't just promise to take a look -- yet another look -- at how the police interact with the public			1
public frustration over policing did n't boil over only because of @entity110 's death			2
it did because of the daily indignities that have become common for black people			0
these boycott organizers feel that helplessness as they watch the police violence spinning out of control and do n't know how to stop it			1
it 's not like you can dial 911			0
to @entity108 , who shot @entity110 " the whole thing started over ' will you just walk on the sidewalk			0
' " then suddenly the man he called a " demon " was dead , he washed his hands of blood and stowed his gun			0
he faced no judicial accountability after 25 days of grand jury investigation			0
a 2013 @entity172 survey showed that 7 of 10 blacks felt they were being treated less fairly than whites by police			1
a @entity177 poll that same year found that nearly 25 % of all black males from ages 18 to 34 reported being treated unfairly by police in the past 30 days			2
" this is not a one - day thing , " @entity85 told us			0
" what # blackoutblackfriday is trying to do is to create ongoing pressure to change the conversation among conscious people of all colors			0
" they might achieve more by opting out of the system than by opposing it			1
your presence is sometimes felt by your absence .			2

@entity196 , @entity197 : instead of @entity59 violence , blacks can use *economic* power
they say blacks in arts urge a @entity35 boycott to make voices heard through absence
they say police brutality is *rampant* and outcry ca n't end with the news cycle
*writers* : blacks might achieve more by opting out of system rather than opposing it
