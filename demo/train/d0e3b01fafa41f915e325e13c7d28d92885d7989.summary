@entity0 -- @entity3 mummies kept in storage for half a century have gone on display in new state - of - the - art galleries at the @entity7 at the @entity8			1
painted wooden sarcophagi decorated with charms , and carefully wrapped and embalmed bodies are now on view in climate - controlled cases following twelve months of painstaking conservation work , alongside a rich array of artifacts from the @entity18			2
they include the almost 3,000 - year - old coffin of a high priest named @entity22 , which was carefully conserved over nine months before its unveiling			1
but these fragile artifacts have n't just received cosmetic work			2
the mummy of a man named @entity28 , who is thought to have been buried in during the 25th dynasty ( between 712 and 770 @entity30 ) underwent a ct scan at a nearby hospital in @entity33			1
the scan revealed amulets in the mouth cavity and stone coverings over the eyes -- and a nearly 3,000 - year - old mystery			1
" it 's intriguing , because his heart was gone and normally you 'd expect the heart to be in situ , " said @entity40 , head of conservation at the museum			2
this is because @entity50 believed they would have to endure a ritual known as " the weighing of the heart " before a monster in the underworld known as the @entity54			0
if their hearts were pure , they could pass into the next life ; if not , the heart would be eaten			0
the cause of @entity28 's death is unknown , but , said @entity40 , there was no sign of broken bones			0
in addition to the ct scan of the mummy , the conservation team also used infra - red imaging to see under - drawings beneath roman - era paintings and used forensic techniques to detect the pigments and materials that ancient artisans would have used			1
these discoveries were a " buzz " for @entity40 and the team of conservators at the museum			0
" we get closer to the object than anyone since the object was made -- sometimes even closer , because we use microscopy and image enhancing , " he said			0
" the role of conservation is changing and it 's much more about material forensic science , " said @entity40			0
the @entity7 is one of the leading centers for the display and study of @entity3 and @entity92 ( modern - day @entity93 )			2
its collection contains a number of artifacts excavated by the so - called " fathers " of modern archaeology , including sir @entity100 and @entity101 , who were working in the late - nineteenth and early - twentieth centuries			0
it even includes items excavated in the 1600s			0
highlights from the collection are being displayed in the museum 's recently redeveloped galleries and include 5,000 - year - old limestone statues , the @entity111 of @entity112 -- the only complete freestanding @entity114 building in @entity115 -- and roman - era portraits of mummies			1
@entity118 , assistant keeper of the @entity3 & @entity93 collection at the @entity7 , hopes the museum 's redeveloped @entity3 and @entity92 galleries , which open to the public saturday , will showcase the reality of ancient @entity3 and help dispel some of the myths surrounding the ancient civilization			1
" the reality of ancient @entity3 is equally as exciting as some of the bizarre myths that have been created around it and hopefully the new exhibits at the @entity7 will inspire the next generation of @entity130 , " he said .			1

@entity3 mummies kept in storage for years are now on display at @entity33 's @entity7
the mummies and artifacts received careful conservation work as part of the museum 's redevelopment plan
exhibition highlights include ct scan of almost 3,000 - year - old mummy and freestanding @entity114 *monument*
the museum 's ancient @entity3 and @entity149 collection is considered one of the *strongest* in the world
