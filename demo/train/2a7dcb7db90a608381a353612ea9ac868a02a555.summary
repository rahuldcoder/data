-- there is a big debate in the world of those advocating gender parity and it goes like this			1
most companies and countries around the globe have a dearth of women in leadership roles			1
many people agree we should be at 50 - 50 , but they do n't agree on how to get there			0
for some , progress has to be ground up , based on governments providing structures that support work - life balance , companies adjusting practices to make it possible for parents to combine work and family , women leaning in , and women in power opening the doors for the next generation of women			1
they believe any other path to progress will be artificial			0
for others , change has to be top down			1
mandatory quotas have to be put in place to get more women into business and politics			1
without them , progress will be too slow because women will simply never get a level playing field to make it into leadership			1
but in order to make quotas work , we need to get a whole lot smarter about them			1
for instance , quotas need sophisticated design - otherwise , they can backfire			1
so what do we know about quotas ? quotas need time to be implemented and to deliver results			1
in @entity64 , the law to implement quotas on corporate boards was passed in 2005 , but companies were expected to comply by 2008			1
at first , board directorships were concentrated among a lucky few , known as the " golden skirts "			0
but over time a wider variety of women moved into these roles , as companies learned how to expand their search for female candidates			1
another example is the political quota in @entity76			0
since the mid- 1990s , 33 percent of the seats in local elected bodies in villages - the panchayats - are reserved for women			1
some men were initially resistant to what they saw as an undeserving advantage for women			2
some even put their own female family members forward as a prop for their own ambitions			0
but after 20 years of growing pains , we can see change on the ground			2
women are now primarily recognized and elected for their leadership on village councils			2
quotas are a temporary catalyst -- if managed well they need not be used forever			2
in @entity100 , voluntary gender quotas introduced by political parties in the 1970s , but were removed two decades later as gender balanced candidate pools became the norm			1
quotas give big , unexpected returns			2
many people believe that quotas will only profit specific individuals that make it into leadership through these mandatory policies and that no one else will benefit			2
@entity76 village councils are responsible for providing local public goods			0
after more women came in through the quota , they started allocating funds to things that mattered more to women , like drinking water			2
in the case of boards , the evidence is more mixed			0
while @entity64 boards have become more professional since the quotas have been put in place , there has been an adverse effect on short - run profits			1
it remains to be seen if this is due to short - term negative perceptions of female management choices and whether in the long - run this pattern will change			2
in @entity76 , 20 years after the quota was first put in place , families ' aspirations for their daughters have changed			0
they want them to be more educated and they want them to be leaders			0
gender quotas are not " one size fits all "			1
they need to be tailored to the issue they are trying to address and that means that sometimes 50 - 50 parity is just not possible , at least not yet			0
for example , while parity may be the ultimate target , a direct quota of 50 % of each gender in an engineering firm that can only tap into a 30 % pool of female science and engineering graduates is likely to lead to a backlash , including amongst women themselves on being perceived as being there for a quota rather than merit			1
but a 30 % quota to tap into the full pool of women engineering graduates can lead to measures that address short - term recruiting as well as understand and root out longer term barriers , setting up the path towards parity			2
the @entity176 put in place a 20 % quota in @entity179 for the companies bringing the largest delegations			0
specifically , a company has 5 places to come to @entity179			0
unless at least one place is given to a woman , the company is only allowed to bring 4 delegates			2
at the time the quota was introduced , this was a big stretch for some of the companies involved who did n't have women in their senior leadership and meant that some might have to forgo that 5th pass			1
but because it was designed collectively with them , everyone could agree to a more aspirational target because it was the right thing to do , even if it meant losses for some of them			0
quotas need to take human behavior into account			2
for example , political quotas that seek to increase the percentage of women candidates in elections also need to make sure that women and men 's names on candidate lists are randomly distributed -- otherwise the traditional " minority " -- women -- end up at the bottom			1
quotas wo n't be sustainable unless other gender parity efforts are put in place			1
in my own country , @entity225 , there is a reservation for women in parliament , but given the poor track record of investment in women 's empowerment more broadly , if the quota were to be removed tomorrow , it is unlikely to have had any lasting effect on women 's integration into politics			1
sometimes , the implied threat of quotas may be as effective as quotas themselves			0
in the @entity250 , under a period of intense discussion regarding whether or not a 25 % quota should be introduced for women on boards , companies have started changing behavior already			0
three years ago women made up 12.5 % of @entity254 directors			0
they now make up 20.4 % , for the first time in history			0
there is no doubt that quotas distort in the short term			0
but they are also one of the most effective tools available to create a more level playing field in the long term			0
they help set a goal , they help address underlying barriers and spur for rapid change			0
the debate on whether or not quotas should be used is getting old and irrelevant			0
we need to start thinking about how quotas can be used			0
we now know a lot more about how quotas work and the evidence shows that are only as effective as their design			0
it 's time to learn how to design smarter quotas			1

quotas for women are often met with *incredible* support or strong *opposition* , says @entity300
@entity300 says quotas take time to bring about change , cites @entity64 as example
quotas have a *ripple* effect on gender equality and *improve* business practices
