when ' life support ' is really ' death support ' court document reveals details medical ethicists , meanwhile , say the high - profile case fuels a misperception : that " brain death " is somehow not as final as cardiac death , even though , by definition , it is			2
the case is " giving the impression that dead people can come back to life , " @entity182 , director of the @entity183 at @entity184 , told @entity0 last week @entity0 has obtained a copy of a medical report , contained in a court filing , that lays out in extensive detail the testing that supports the hospital 's conclusion that @entity16 has no hope of recovery			1

his report also says @entity16 showed no sign of breathing on her own when a ventilator was removed : " @entity215 failed apnea test			2

" family criticizes hospital @entity29 's family has criticized the hospital 's handling of the matter , accusing doctors of pressuring them to disconnect life support			1
" we wish to acknowledge that @entity29 's case , and our stance regarding her right to life , and her mother 's right to make decisions regarding her child , has stirred a vibrant , sometimes polarizing , national debate			0
this was never our intention , " the family 's statement said			0
" we have our strong religious convictions and set of beliefs and we believe that , in this country , a parent has the right to make decisions concerning the existence of their child : not a doctor who looks only at lines on a paper , or reads the cold black and white words on a law that says ' brain dead ' and definitely not a doctor who runs the facility that caused the brain death in the first place			1
" @entity45 , the hospital spokesman , described the situation monday as tragic " by every measure of the word			0
" " there has been some limited conversation between the hospital 's attorney and the family 's attorney , but that 's a privileged communication and i have no update on behalf of the hospital at this moment , " he said , " other than to say our hearts , our sympathy , go out to this family and the young woman 's body on the respirator at this hospital			2
" when routine surgeries go wrong @entity0 's @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 and @entity311 contributed to this report .			0
