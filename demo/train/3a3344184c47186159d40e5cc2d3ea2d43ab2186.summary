@entity2 is @entity3 ' main man -- and the new formula one world champion			1
after a rollercoaster eight months of intense competition with his @entity3 teammate @entity7 , the @entity5 captured a second world title with victory at the final race of the year in @entity11			1
the 29 - year - old added the 2014 crown at the twilight season finale to the 2008 title he won with @entity16			1
the hyped desert duel between @entity2 and @entity7 failed to materialize when the @entity19 's car lost power from its hybrid energy recovery system at the halfway stage of the race and his challenge fell away			1
@entity3 told @entity7 to retire his car because of " too many problems " but he responded : " i would like to go to the end			1
" as his title rival and teenage friend had to swallow a bitter defeat , @entity2 , who had passed @entity7 for the lead at the start , sailed to the checkered flag , winning his 11th race of the season -- and with it a second world title			1
" @entity40 ! world champion , i ca n't believe it ! " an ecstatic @entity2 cheered over the pit to car radio on his victory lap. keeping his swelling emotions under wraps , @entity2 did not take off his helmet as he hugged his family and girlfriend , @entity52 pop star @entity51 , when he climbed out of the car			2
" i 'm a bit lost for words really , " @entity2 beamed from the @entity11 podium			1
" this is the greatest day of my life			0
it 's really due to the people around me			0
2008 was a special time in my life but the feeling i have now is way , way past that			0
" it means even more than the first one			0
it feels like it 's the first time			0
" before @entity2 joined the two @entity69 drivers of @entity70 and @entity71 , who had finished second and third , on the podium , @entity7 also came to hug it out with @entity2			1
" he just came into the room and said ' you drove really well ' " revealed @entity2			0
" @entity7 put on an incredible fight throughout the year			2
he was a phenomenal competitor			0
" @entity7 had held the championship lead until the fifth race of the season in @entity80 where a fourth victory for his @entity83 rival saw him take over at the top of the standings			1
it was a bittersweet homecoming for the two drivers at the next race in @entity89 , the glamorous @entity90 principality where the pair both live in the same apartment building			0
@entity7 was accused and cleared of blocking @entity2 during qualifying and he went on to celebrate a victory on the streets of @entity96			2
in @entity98 , there was another flashpoint between the @entity3 teammates , who have been friends and racing rivals since they were teenagers			0
@entity7 collided with the rear of @entity2 's car while battling to regain the lead and the resulting damage to his car ultimately put the @entity5 out of the race			1
from may to september , @entity7 held the championship lead but the pendulum swung back in @entity2 's favor as , reinvigorated by the @entity98 bust - up , he motored to the checkered flag in @entity113			1
the @entity5 ticked off victories in @entity115 , @entity116 and the @entity52 to make it five in a row before @entity7 fought back at the penultimate race in @entity120 to close the gap to 17 points			2
the desert denouement in @entity11 awarded double points to the top 10 drivers with 50 points , instead of 25 , on offer for the race winner			1
the new rule gave @entity7 -- the son of 1982 world champion @entity130 -- a tantalizing golden carrot as he chased a first world title of his own			1
but the final twist of a mesmerizing @entity135 season , came not from the gimmick of double points but from @entity3 ' own making			1
the mighty @entity3 engine that had driven the fierce rivalry between the two championship rivals proved to be @entity7 's undoing			1
at the halfway stage of the race , he radioed in to report his car was losing power			1
the team confirmed his hybrid car 's energy recovery system -- which is worth 160 @entity83 horse power for around 33 second per lap -- was no longer working			1
@entity7 tried to stay positive and manage his race			2
asked by reporters in @entity11 if he ever gave up on the title he said : " i still believed in it for a long time as there was the possibility @entity157 would have a problem			2
" i was still pushing on the last lap and that 's why i wanted to finish the race			0
" the @entity19 crossed the line in 14th , his lowest finish of the season aside from two retirements in @entity83 and @entity113			2
@entity2 won the title by 67 points but even without the bonus of double points his championship victory would have been emphatic			1
the tense tale of competition between the two @entity3 drivers gave a thrilling narrative to the 2014 @entity135 season , which saw the introduction of major rules changes focused on engine technology			1
both drivers will have undoubtedly learned something from their see sawing mano a mano contest through 19 races around the globe			0
" he was the best on the grid this year and i came very close , " @entity7 acknowledged to reporters in @entity11			1
" to be able to fight with @entity157 has been great			0
" to be up against him , the level was incredibly high and so i also had to find and deliver the next level			0
" friends at last ? the teamwork between the two @entity3 drivers ensured the @entity193 marque won its first ever team title with three races to spare			2
an 11th one - two finish in @entity120 saw the team also break the previous record for the most one - two finishes in a single season set by fierce @entity16 rivals @entity202 and @entity203 in 1988			0
" this has been an incredible year , " said @entity2			0
" i just can not believe how amazing this has all been			0
" the decision to come here , when a lot of people said it was the wrong choice			0
the steps we took last year and then coming into this year , it was just unbelievable			0
" speaking of his relationship with @entity7 , @entity2 added : " it 's been so intense between us all year long			1
" without a doubt we 've had a friendship that we built a long , long , long time ago , so that will always be there			0
" perhaps things naturally will ease up a little now			0
i know what it 's like losing a championship so , for sure , we 'll keep working at it			0
" as the sun set on the 2014 season , @entity2 prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend , who had surprised him by flying into @entity11 on sunday morning			2
but the world of @entity135 moves fast and even for the new world champion and the runner - up there is little pause to digest what has been achieved or what might have been			2
the preparation for the @entity3 title defense loom large			0
@entity2 said he will have a seat fitting for the 2015 car next week while @entity7 takes part in the end of season test .			2
