-- @entity1 will take the axe to its controversial tax structuring unit , as the @entity5 lender seeks to clean up its image in the wake of a succession of scandals			1
the business , which at its peak may have generated as much as three - quarters of profits at @entity1 ' investment banking operation , will be shrunk dramatically as part of the bank 's @entity16 under new chief executive , @entity18			1
@entity1 ' actions comes as global banks from @entity21 to @entity22 are reviewing their business models in response to new regulations and government enforcement efforts			1
" we have to take a fresh look to see if there are products and services in which ... we no longer deem it appropriate to do business , regardless of financial return , " @entity27 , @entity1 investment banking chief , said in an address to investors on monday night			1
" for example , elements of our tax advisory business have generated negative media and political attention			2
" mr @entity27 also signalled a likely withdrawal from selling derivatives products to consumers and small business customers , following an industry - wide scandal over the mis - selling of interest rate hedging contracts to @entity51			0
mr @entity18 reaffirmed @entity1 ' commitment to its investment bank more broadly , silencing predictions he would significantly reduce its size			2
but the new chief executive , formerly head of the group 's retail banking operation , was clear that ethical behaviour would become a priority in future			0
all activities would in future be " screened for reputational impact " as well as profitability , mr @entity18 said			1
" our ability to build a franchise over time depends on our reputation , " he added , admitting the bank had made some " serious mistakes " in recent years			0
this summer @entity1 was fined £ 290m by global regulators over the attempted rigging of @entity75 benchmark borrowing rates , triggering the abrupt resignation of chairman @entity77 and chief executive @entity78			1
the tax business -- known as the " structured capital markets " unit -- has attracted unwelcome attention for at least three years			1
though legal , the avoidance strategies it used on behalf of its clients were politically controversial			0
@entity1 ' own group tax affairs were thrown into the spotlight twice in recent months , first over the use of a tax loophole that the @entity91 retrospectively closed , then over a " tax equalisation " payment to mr @entity78 of about £ 6m			1
speaking to analysts and investors , mr @entity18 also repeated an earlier promise to report back on his strategic plan -- including details of which businesses would be shrunk -- by the first quarter of next year			0
but he added : " you should not expect me to announce the break - up of the bank or an exit from whole business lines			0
" @entity1 ' board last month drafted in @entity108 grandee sir @entity107 as the bank 's new chairman and elevated mr @entity18 to chief executive three weeks later , in an effort to stabilise the group following mr @entity77 and mr @entity78 's resignations			2
there had been a widespread expectation that mr @entity18 would shift @entity1 ' focus away from investment banking , which has traditionally generated two - thirds to three - quarters of group profits			0
however , bankers believe more of the rebalancing will come from the projected revival of the group 's corporate banking unit and its troubled retail banking operations outside the @entity5			2
in a question - and - answer session with analysts , mr @entity18 would not be drawn on the extent of any change of direction , but he did talk about the group being more " balanced " with " lower risk "			0
