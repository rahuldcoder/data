-- she 's laid down the law in female skiing for the past five years , now @entity4 is pondering legal action in her quest to test herself against the men			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) blocked her bid to challenge the sport 's top male stars at a recent meeting in @entity13 , but as @entity4 has proved throughout her glittering career to date she 's no quitter			1
speaking exclusively to @entity0 ahead of an @entity16 event in @entity17 , @entity18 , the finest female skier of her generation insisted this fight was n't over			1
@entity4 said : " i was definitely disappointed with their decision			1
after discussing with them my request they seemed pretty positive and optimistic that we could find a solution and then i got their answer and they were completely against it			2
" i do n't want to make a big stink out of it but i feel like their response that i ca n't race with the men simply because i 'm a woman was definitely gender - biased so i 'm going to do what i can and hopefully make something work			1
" so right now i 'm looking into options -- my father is an attorney so i 'm just seeing if there 's any options , legally , that i can take			2
" it is a brave person who pits their wits against @entity4			2
the 28 - year - old already has a cabinet stuffed full of silverware , including @entity53 gold at @entity54 in 2010 , and is officially the second most successful female skier of all time			1
@entity4 is renowned in @entity58 's skiing heartlands and a bona fide star in @entity60 but she claims a battle with the male fraternity would elevate the sport to new heights in her homeland			1
she responded to the @entity8 ruling in typical fashion by sweeping all three downhill events at @entity69 in @entity13 , despite crashing during one , and all that on the back of recovering from a stomach illness which left her hospitalized in november			2
@entity4 was also on the podium at the most recent meeting in @entity75 and is third in the overall standings as she strives for a fifth career @entity16 title			2
but as she continues her preparation for this weekend 's meet at @entity17 , her other goal has clearly not been forgotten			2
" i do n't see @entity4 giving up anytime soon , that 's for sure , she 'll try another avenue , " said 1992 @entity53 champion @entity82 , who thinks @entity4 would have finished around 20th had her wish to race the men at @entity69 been granted			1
" she 's doing this for her but with that she also appreciates what it 'll do for skiing in @entity60 and the @entity90			1
people know who she is but they do n't really understand the depth of her greatness			0
" @entity90 women 's head coach @entity95 agrees with @entity97			1
the @entity100 , himself a former national giant slalom champion , says @entity4 's commitment sets her apart from her competitors			1
" it 's obvious that she has put all of her energy into the sport in the last five years , " @entity95 explained to @entity0			2
" that makes her special			0
she 's living for her sport			2
she 's prepared like nobody else going into races			0
" after her new - season successes , the @entity117 native now has a career total of 57 victories , pushing her ahead of @entity122 's @entity121 and into second on the all - time win list			1
only legendary @entity100 @entity125 remains ahead of @entity4 , on 62 career victories , a tally that , barring injury , surely she will surpass			2
" @entity129 was an unbelievable champion and won a lot of races at that time , " added @entity95			0
" but there was n't the same competition then			0
" the sport is getting more complex , it is harder to break those records			0
i think she [ @entity4 ] is the greatest so far and it is a matter of time before she breaks those records			1
" @entity4 , a four - time @entity16 champion , lobbied the @entity8 to race the men at @entity69 as it is one of the few meets in the skiing calendar where males and females compete on the same slopes			1
but a diktat from the sport 's governing body ruled " one gender is not entitled to participate in the races of the other			1
" " it 's not like i 'm getting 20th every day and saying i want to race the men , " @entity4 told reporters in @entity13			1
" i try to let my skiing speak for itself			0
" i do n't know exactly where i 'd stack up , but that 's kind of the whole point , to see where i stand and see how much farther i can push my skiing because the men , they 're skiing is the best in the world hands down			1
that 's where i want to get my skiing to be			2
" a perfect illustration of @entity4 's supremacy came at the venue that starts the weekend as @entity69 , and ends it as @entity172			1
" she was near - perfect the first day , " @entity173 explained			0
" on the second day she made a major mistake and it was almost disastrous , she had her tails of her skis in the net , she was almost sideways and she still won by half a second			0
" it 's difficult for her to maintain the elite level of focus throughout the season			0
for @entity4 she is very goal orientated , she feeds off any doubt whatsoever			2
she says it fuels her fire and makes her go			0
" @entity4 is not alone in her quest , and she points to female golfer @entity189 as an inspiration in her battle			1
the @entity192 , who won 72 times on the @entity194 and triumphed in ten major championships , took on the men at a @entity198 event back in 2003			0
prior to the tournament , three - time major winner @entity199 said @entity189 " did n't belong " at the tournament			2
she eventually shot four - over - par and missed the cut , but tied for first in driving accuracy during her first round			0
@entity4 had previously told the @entity207 : " i 'd like to have one chance in my life to race against them			1
@entity211 did it in golf and paved the way for women			0
i 'm not asking for @entity16 points			0
i just want the chance to compete			0
" @entity97 says there are plenty of male competitors on the tour who support @entity4 's desire but also some who joke she should be allowed to see how she gets on against them on the notoriously treacherous @entity226 track in @entity100			1
but , the @entity8 aside , there is almost total uniformity within the sport that skiing would benefit from the huge media interest any showdown would attract			0
" the more i reflect on who she is , what she 's done and how great it would be for this sport , in my opinion it is a marketing opportunity that @entity8 should be taking , " @entity173 added			0
" i realise in @entity100 , @entity122 , alpine skiing is one of the premier sports they watch , they do n't necessarily have an issue getting people interested in the sport			0
" anytime there 's an athlete 's presence and profile has surpassed the sport in that nation , which hers has in @entity60 , i think we 'd be crazy not to use that opportunity she 's handing to us on a platter			0
" @entity4 is already the most successful skier the @entity90 has ever produced , and should she overtake @entity259 's record , only one person could claim to have more wins than her -- @entity192 's male legend @entity262 , on 86			1
of @entity4 's quest to cross the gender boundary , @entity95 said : " that 's something she really wants , she sees it as the next level of ski racing			1
she wants to see how far up she is , that 's the only goal			0
" she can compete with them , it all depends on the snow preparation , what the conditions are			0
we have situations in training where she trains against men			0
she 's never done it in a race situation and i think that 's where she really wants to be			2
" @entity4 is backed by the @entity287 and now seems determined to head down legal avenues to pursue her dream of sharing a slope with the men			1
@entity173 added : " i 'm not sure if @entity8 will be able to say yes because they do things in a very old fashioned way			0
but she 's a pioneer and for the first of anything it takes a little bit longer to break the barrier down			0
