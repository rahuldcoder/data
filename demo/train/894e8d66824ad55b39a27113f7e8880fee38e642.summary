the @entity0 , home to one of the world 's most celebrated collections of art and historical artifacts reopened saturday after a 10 - year , $ 489 million rebuilding project which saw many of its treasures travel the world while the gallery was closed			1
queen @entity12 performed the opening ceremony in @entity14 , one of her final official duties before she abdicates at the end of the month			1
once open , the @entity0 will welcome visitors 365 days a year			1
thousands attended the ceremony and poured into the museum , eager to reacquaint themselves with old favorites including @entity24 's " @entity23 , " @entity26 's " @entity25 , " and @entity27 ' " @entity28 , " or to catch a glimpse of new highlights : an @entity32 " @entity36 " dress , a 16th century sculpture of the " @entity34 , " or a war plane dating to 1917			1
interactive : explore @entity24 's ' night watch ' " it is the beginning of a new era , an exciting new future for a new museum , the museum of the @entity45 , " says @entity0 director @entity39			1
" everything has changed , the only thing that has n't is ' @entity23 '			2
it is the altarpiece of the @entity0 , and the whole place is arranged around this beautiful masterpiece			2
" the new chronological displays place paintings and historical objects alongside each other " to give context , " says @entity57 , curator of 17th century art at the museum			2
the aim , he says , is " to tell stories , to tell the story of @entity45 history and culture			1
" " we want to give visitors a sense of time , and a sense of beauty , " says @entity65 , director of collections			0
" when you enter the @entity0 , you are transported into another world -- the world of @entity24 , of @entity26 and of @entity36			1
" the renovation has seen some parts of the gallery , designed by @entity78 , restored to their former glory			0
the original entrance hall 's opulent stained glass and wall paintings , considered so cathedral - like they sparked protests in fiercely @entity85 in 1885 , are back			2
the four - story library , featuring ornate ironwork , a vertiginous spiral staircase and 5.4km ( 3 miles ) of bookshelves , is open to the public for the first time			0
but huge swathes of the gallery have been radically modernized -- @entity95 architects @entity96 have stripped out the makeshift galleries installed in the museum 's courtyards over the decades			1
in their place is a huge , bright and airy atrium			0
interior architect @entity102 has overseen the removal of all potentially distracting elements from the galleries : gone are the colored walls , heavy drapes and gloomy display cabinets			0
instead the jewel - like paintings are hung on minimalist gray walls , priceless items are displayed in ultra-clear glass boxess			0
if glass boxes are not absolutely necessary , we do n't use them , " insists @entity57			0
the whole collection is illuminated with the latest led lighting			0
but while the displays themselves are the height of modernity , there is one 21st century touch missing from the galleries : " there are no video screens and no computer screens in the galleries , " says @entity128			0
" we believe the works of art should speak for themselves			2
" in any case , the experts say , most visitors interested in a high - tech view of the collection will have smartphones or tablets with which to access the @entity0 's new website			1
while the main museum was under reconstruction , some of its best - known artworks , including " @entity23 " were kept on display in a small annexe			1
others were lent to exhibitions around the world , from @entity149 and @entity150 , to @entity151 , and to @entity152 , after the 2011 @entity154 earthquake .			0
