-- creating your own religion in the real world can result in weird looks , unusual friends and sometimes , visits from law enforcement officials			1
creating your own religion in the soon - to - be - released expansion for " @entity13 " results in bonuses and benefits on your way to world domination			1
the new " @entity13 : @entity20 and @entity21 " expansion pack offers players two revamped elements to the iconic real - time strategy game -- faith and spies			1
neither is entirely new to the franchise , but each has been redone to make it more interesting and rewarding to use			0
@entity26 is a new resource , like gold or science			0
civilizations can accumulate faith by building shrines , temples and mosques			0
acquire enough faith and your fledging country can discover its own pantheon of dieties			0
@entity40 reward players with bonuses based the way the player has played the rest of the game			1
as such , the player can decide what sort of beliefs the gods represent about their civilization			1
bring enough followers to your cause and eventually you can create a fully formed religion ( i called mine " @entity57 " )			1
you will also get additional bonuses to your civilization as a whole , and specific additions to city abilities			1
later , you can enhance your religion and gain more benefits			1
there are a limited number of religions that can be created and not every country will get to create their own			0
this puts a premium on developing faith early in the game so you can acquire the bonuses best suited to your playing style			1
religion was introduced in " @entity80 , " but this expansion to " @entity13 " boosts its abilities to offer benefits to the entire civilization			1
for instance , there was no condition for a religious victory in the preview build of the game			2
religion passively crosses borders and spreads to neighboring civilizations , but active missionary work can only occur in friendly cities and city - states			2
the developers at @entity98 really tried to make religion something unique for each player and playing style			2
there are plenty of choices for beliefs and some new leaders players can control offer additional faith benefits			0
the preview build of " @entity13 " ended in the year 1290 ( 189 turns ) so it will be interesting to find out how religion plays out in the later stages of the game when it will have to compete with more technology - based units and goals			1
the second " new " unit is the @entity117 , but unlike its predecessor in other versions in the franchise , it is n't a specific unit to move around on the battlefield			0
the " gods and @entity21 " expansion pack comes with a steampunk scenario called " empires of the @entity127 " and offers a good opportunity to use the spies			1
the scenario starts out in the @entity132 and offers steampunkish new abilities and units , like the @entity135 and the @entity136			2
the civilization leaders are decked out in top hats , wielding goggles and other trinkets you 'd expect in a steampunk adventure			2
the goals of the scenario are also different from the traditional game			2
become the leader in five different categories and you win			0
@entity117 play a big role here and help players keep an eye on their rivals			0
you can assign them to steal technology , find out information or kill enemy spies			2
they also will slant local voting in your favor to give you a better reputation in the city where they 're working			2
in past " civilization " iterations , spies would have to sneak their way to an enemy city , do one mission and hopefully escape with their lives			1
in " @entity173 , " spies stick around in the cities where they are assigned for as long as they want ( provided they are n't discovered )			0
this allows players to concentrate on other aspects of the game while still getting intelligence reports on their neighbors			0
spies can be reassigned , but do you really want to risk an information black hole in the city you 're leaving vacant ? the " @entity189 " scenario was short , but offered the best chance to see the spies in action			0
i only recruited one spy in normal game play in turn 187 and that happened spontaneously			0
will there be something in the later stages that helps players recruit more agents or train them better ? " @entity13 : gods and @entity21 " will offer more units , buildings , @entity204 and new civilizations to try out			1
revamping the religious and spy elements will make the game even more thoughtful ( if that 's possible ) and challenging for new and experienced players alike			0
" one more turn " just got a whole lot harder to avoid .			0

" civilization " expansion revamps religion and spies
" @entity13 : @entity20 and @entity21 " *updates* the iconic strategy game
religion can help define a civilization and give it abilities
spies are more *flexible* in the new version
