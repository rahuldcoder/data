-- when i asked an old friend why she had n't just broken up with her live - in boyfriend instead of beginning a messy affair with a married neighbor , she snapped , " do n't be stupid -- nobody leaves a relationship without having another one in place			1
" overlappers refuse to end one relationship until they have another one in progress			2
oh , please , i corrected her			2
people fall out of love or get angry and leave without a safety net all the time			2
but as i thought back , i realized that for as long as i knew her , she never had			0
even when she pretty much hated the one she was with , she stuck it out until she 'd lined up his replacement			0
i could never understand why			0
my friend is beautiful , successful and very smart ; surely being single for a little while would n't end her world			2
women are n't the only ones guilty of this			1
i know -- and have unfortunately dated -- plenty of men who careen from one girlfriend directly into another , often with a big fat overlap ; connecting the two relationships like a murky @entity37 diagram			1
i understand that being single can be annoying and lonely sometimes , but there are plenty of good reasons not to be -- or date ! -- an @entity41			2
karma ! while overlapping is definitely cheating , the difference is these types go into it with the sole purpose of transitioning into another relationship			1
but however you word it , @entity11 deceive one or both parties in order to get what they want			1
when you begin a relationship dishonestly , it usually comes back to bite you in the butt			0
at the very least , you will never be fully able to trust an @entity41			0
because -- as yet another cliche based in truth goes -- if he does it with you , he 'll do it to you			1
drama ! breakups are never fun , however splits caused by infidelity are hands down the most explosive			0
if you 're like my friend and her man ( who , against all odds , actually left his wife ) , this means that instead of talking about hearts , flowers , and butterflies -- like other new couples -- you spend your nights plotting how to hide assets and whether or not your overpaid lawyer is enough of a shark			1
the pressure ! though they may appear independent , people who ca n't be alone are that way because they need to see themselves reflected in someone else 's adoring eyes			1
but when their mirror ( aka , partner ) develops a flaw ( weight gain , job loss , etc. ) , their image of themselves reflects that			0
being a narcissist , nothing less than perfection is acceptable , so they start looking for the next mirror			0
got that , fatty ? you 'd better stay at the top of your game if you want to hang onto an @entity41			0
not cute ! " i met my boyfriend when his puppy peed on my foot " is the perfect example of a meet - cute story			0
it has all the key elements -- chance , humor , and , best of all , a cuddly puppy ! " i met my boyfriend because i was his kids ' nanny and then his wife found out , which is how i got this black eye , " is definitely not a tale you 're going to want to share at parties			1

some people *afraid* to be alone are guilty of dating overlapping
they cheat on both partners while transitioning between relationships
@entity11 ca n't be trusted -- they might do it to you
because they 're narcissistic , they 'll trade you in for better model
