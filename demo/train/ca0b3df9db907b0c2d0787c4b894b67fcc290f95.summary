-- a little over a week ago nearly every media outlet was fixated on @entity2 and his apology news conference			1
we saw pundits , columnists , journalists , radio talk show hosts , psychologists , body language experts , entertainers and anyone with an opinion weigh in on the sincerity of @entity2 : was he really sorry for committing adultery , should he apologize further and hundreds of other angles			1
some even described him as a fallen athlete who will lose millions of endorsements and a man who has destroyed the trust he built up with his fans			0
i even heard one woman say she needed @entity2 to apologize , yet could n't articulate why it mattered so much to her , especially since she was n't his wife , kin to him , and was n't a family friend			1
yet if there was ever one athlete we could truly place in that category of fallen athlete , it would be former @entity36 star @entity35			1
while @entity2 brought shame on himself and his family by his admitted extramarital affairs , he has broken no laws , and what he did does n't affect us at all			1
yet @entity35 is another matter			2
this week , he was led away in handcuffs after being sentenced in a @entity45 court for fatally shooting a limo driver on february 14 , 2002			0
some carried his sentencing live			0
yet most networks ignored his case , which ended eight years of courtroom drama			2
frankly , if there was a case that is instructive to kids who look up to athletes , it 's @entity35 , not @entity2			1
@entity35 was a gregarious and fun - loving man who could light up the court			1
after injuries took their toll and ended his @entity36 career , he was a rising tv analyst with @entity61 , a playful man with a big heart			1
i 'll never forget watching him on " @entity65 " with his dad as they talked about building his huge mansion , how it was a place where hundreds of kids traveled through as a result of his charitable endeavors and how he had a zest for life			0
but that all ended on the night the life of @entity75 ended			0
after a dinner , @entity35 returned to his home and was showing several folks his many guns when he snapped his double - barreled 12 - gauge shotgun shut			2
@entity35 did n't realize it was loaded , and a single bullet hit @entity75 in the chest			2
a panicked @entity35 put the gun in @entity75 's hand , and even jumped in his pool , hoping to wash away the evidence			2
@entity35 was acquitted of aggravated manslaughter and convicted on four counts of coverup			2
he settled with @entity75 's family for $ 2 million , all while the case went back and forth through the legal system			0
while that was happening , @entity35 began to lose it all			0
his wife filed for divorce ; he was hit with a stun gun by police after an encounter ; he crashed his vehicle in another incident and threatened to kill himself			0
@entity35 was a man who fell victim to alcohol and guns , a deadly combination			1
he was sentenced to five years in jail and is eligible for parole in 18 months			0
everything he had -- money , fame , budding tv career , marriage , friends , respect -- all lost because of the horrible decisions he made one fateful night			0
@entity35 did n't achieve the level of fame as @entity2 , but we can surely learn more from his fall from grace than @entity2 's			1
the former killed a man , the latter cheated on his wife			0
both morally wrong , only one legally wrong			1
@entity2 will undoubtedly return to the golf course one day			0
sure , he can fret about losing millions in endorsements and may have to confront losing his wife			0
but @entity35 must forever live with the memory of a man dying as a result of his actions			1
we all may want to focus on @entity2 , but it 's the tragedy of @entity35 that should have all of us talking and examining what went wrong in the charmed life of a basketball star			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity138 .			0
