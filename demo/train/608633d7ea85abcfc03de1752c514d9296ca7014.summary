-- newspaper companies are a dying breed , and one consistent scapegoat for their demise is the rise of blogs and online news sites			1
in october 2009 , @entity8 , ceo of the @entity10 news service , said blogs were directing large amounts of revenue away from original content creators			1
at the same time , @entity15 sneered at bloggers , saying they would cause the " content creators " like his company @entity18 , parent of the @entity20 and @entity21 , " to pay the ultimate price " if they were not held in check			0
blogs and other new media from @entity27 to @entity28 have made newspapers less relevant			1
if you want quicker , more focused news , blogs are a great resource			1
if you want more local , hyperpersonal news -- i.e. , what your sister 's cat did today -- then @entity27 or @entity28 are your best bets			2
but despite factors of expediency and personalization , new media outlets are not to blame for the creeping death of newspapers			2
it makes for a great story to have upstart blogs destroying hidebound news organizations , but the truth is much more simple			1
advertisers have fled newspapers for the greener , cheaper pastures of the internet and they 're not coming back			1
on the internet , an advertiser has a greater ability to target his or her ad spend			1
want to advertise to just teenage boys interested in football ? ca n't do that with the newspaper			0
want to advertise to women from @entity66 ? ca n't do that in a newspaper			0
the numbers prove this out			0
@entity71 , an expert on the economics of the newspaper industry , recently reported that newspaper advertising was down about 10 percent year - over - year for the first quarter of the year			0
meanwhile , advertising on the internet , radio and television were all up			2
web advertising was up 7.5 percent			2
newspapers still attract more ad dollars than the web , but that is expected to change soon			1
@entity86 ' annual report on media trends reported that web advertising totaled $ 24.2 billion last year			2
the @entity89 reported $ 24.82 billion in advertising for 2009			0
by the end of this year , the web may be in front			2
the expansion of advertising on the web is both good news and bad news for newspapers			1
newspapers like the @entity100 have taken advantage of the web to create amazing products like interactive graphics and videos			1
this has helped propel their overall readership to new heights			0
millions of people visit the @entity100 ' website daily			0
that 's important to keep in mind when anyone thinks of blaming blogs for the death of newspapers			2
there 's enough people on the web to go around			2
newspapers and blogs are expanding their audiences simultaneously			2
as newspapers take advantage of the medium to tell stories , they 'll see some of that $ 24 billion in online ad dollars			1
unfortunately , it wo n't be enough to support what they do now -- and most of the money is going to the likes of @entity135			1
the @entity100 online edition only generates a fraction of the revenue of the print publication			0
the @entity100 is a lot less relevant as a place to advertise online than it was offline			0
and no , blogs are not siphoning many dollars off the @entity100 online franchise			2
the @entity144 is the most successful blog in the world , with some 12 million unique visitors a month			0
that traffic bests traditional news organizations like the @entity150 , the @entity151 and the @entity20 by a couple of million			1
yet , for all its success , revenue remains relatively elusive			0
@entity144 only generated $ 15 million last year			0
it hopes to double that this year to $ 30 million , but that 's still tiny			0
for some perspective , the @entity100 ' online revenue is an estimated $ 150 million to $ 175 million annually			0
if advertisers are n't spending heavily on blogs or traditional news organizations , where are they spending ? @entity135			1
the search giant has annual revenue of more than $ 20 billion , with the vast majority of that from web advertising			0
the funny thing about @entity135 is that it has tried to master almost every sort of business			1
it 's investing in windmills , it 's investing in mobile phones , it wants to lay cable for high speed internet connections , just to name a few			0
yet , for all the businesses it has tried , there 's one it says it has no interest in : print content like newspapers			0
the reason ? making money on newspapers , and getting advertisers interested in spending again on print publications , has even the big brains at @entity135 stumped			1
@entity135 ceo @entity190 recently told newspaper editors , " we have a business model problem			1
we do n't have a news problem			0
" we do n't have a news problem , because there 's enough news under the sun for newspapers and blogs to cover it all			1
now , if there were only enough ad dollars			1
