what would drive a man to give up the luxury of serviced apartments for nothing but @entity7 rentals -- some good , some terrible -- for an entire year ? ask @entity8			1
originally from @entity9 , @entity8 moved to @entity10 over a year ago with his wife and daughter " for an adventure			1
" when a position in the advertising company he works for opened in southern @entity16 , he began making extended solo business trips to @entity18 , each time staying at a different place he found on @entity7			1
originally , @entity8 pledged to carry out his @entity7 lifestyle for a year , but now he 's hooked and says he 'll continue the experiment indefinitely			1
get out of the ' expat bubble ' " i wanted to make up for the fact that i did n't grow up in @entity18 , to gain credibility with clients and really understand @entity18 beyond that expat bubble that a lot of people stay in , " says @entity8			1
" and it sounded fun , " he adds			2
the intrepid traveler has rolled his suitcase all over the territory , deliberately picking neighborhoods far off the beaten trail			2
when we spoke with him , @entity8 was on his 80th @entity7 stay in @entity39 , an area nearly at the northwestern @entity18 border known for a once - thriving oyster farming industry			1
" the thing that strikes me most strongly about @entity18 is the diversity of the places i 've been to , " he says			1
" if you 're not from here , the only things you 're seeing are cable cars , the @entity50 and dense urban neighborhoods in @entity51 and @entity52			2
" but what i have loved so much are the outlying islands , @entity55 and @entity56			2
" they have the feel of @entity59 , yet you can hop on a train or bus and 20 minutes later you 're in the fast - paced chaos again			2
" the advertising creative says he began his @entity7 project out of his own initiative and acts independently of the company			2
" we know each other and like each other , " says @entity8 of his relationship with @entity7			1
" there 's no compensation , no discounts , no nothing , " says @entity8			1
" they 've had a couple of community gatherings here in @entity18 that i 've been invited to , but other than that we know how to appreciate each other			1
" we asked @entity8 for his five most memorable stays and he happily obliged			1
@entity83 " i really think that this was by far the highlight of my year , " says @entity8			1
" it was in one of the most predictable neighborhoods -- that expat bubble that i mentioned , " he says			1
" this place was right on @entity90 just off the @entity83 escalator			2
" i 'm used to walking into places that are super small , but when i walked into this place all i saw was the small couch and table and i thought i 'd have to sleep on the couch			0
" then the guy hits this button on the wall and the ceiling lowers down and it stops just a couple centimeters above the table			1
" it was the bed			1
" it was singly the most crazy aspect of any space i 've ever been to before			0
it was probably not the best sleep , but ( it was ) the most memorable			0
" @entity106 @entity8 arrived at @entity106 without any idea of what he was walking into			1
" it was during the week that we have the @entity112 's birthday holiday , " says @entity8			1
" i thought i would stay near a beach so i was just looking for an island to stay at and found this place listed			0
" when he booked the apartment , the host asked him if it was ok that there would be a ban on meat on the island that week			0
" i was like , that 's weird , but sure			0
" then she asked if i mind that there would be a parade passing right outside my door			0
turns out the place is 28 steps -- i counted -- away from the bun towers			0
" i found myself in the heart of this crazy unique bun festival			0
it was one of the most memorable days and i had no idea what i was in for			0
" @entity137 for his stay in @entity140 's @entity137 , trying to find the place was half the fun			0
" the directions the host gave me were i forget how many turns and bridges and watch out for this building and that one			0
it was all these hand - drawn things			0
" i 'm amazed that all these things are just a ferry ride from @entity52 and they retain their character so well			0
" the home he stayed in was a refurbished cowshed			2
" i look for neighborhoods that i 've never been to as well as anything that just looks interesting -- good interesting or bad interesting			0
" i was the last person to stay at the cowshed before they began renovating the place			2
i hope they keep the ceiling			2
" @entity161 when @entity8 's daughter came to visit he wanted to find a special place to stay			1
a 60 - foot yacht in a luxury marina in @entity161 fit the bill			0
" the boat was incredible , " says @entity8			1
" there was a helper , four bedrooms , and because our flight into @entity18 was delayed we could n't enjoy the boat very much on our original stay , so the host gave us another free night to make up for it			1
" @entity176 this residential development on the south end of @entity140 is only accessible by boat and foot			0
" in the 1970s it was a happening place , but it has gone through various bankruptcies and now there are few people living there			0
" it has its own private ferry service from @entity106			0
" i rode that ferry four times and each time there was no more than three people on it and no one talked to each other			0

to get out of the ' expat bubble , ' @entity196 @entity8 stays only in @entity198 when in @entity18
from a *hidden* ceiling bed to a renovated cowshed , @entity8 is impressed with the diversity of @entity18 *accommodations*
