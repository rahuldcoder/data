@entity0 -- huge inflatable plugs -- now being developed by the federal government to protect subway tunnels from terrorist attacks -- likely could have saved some of @entity8 's subway tunnels from storm - related flooding , according to plug developers , some of whom are wistful that development was n't completed in time for @entity15			1
the @entity16 successfully tested a plug in january , using the 16 - foot diameter prototype to hold back pressurized water at a test tunnel in @entity21 , @entity22			1
another test to demonstrate the plug 's reliability is scheduled for next week			1
but project managers said only one current - generation plug has been manufactured , and they say they are two years away from marketing them to the nation 's transit and highway authorities			1
get the latest updates on @entity15 on @entity1 's live blog " if we would have had these things installed in the right places ( in @entity8 ) , they could have made a terrific difference , " said @entity34 of the @entity35			0
" the problem is we do n't have a stock of things that we could put in place			0
it 's not like we have a bunch of these sitting in a warehouse , " @entity34 said			0
" it 's a little frustrating really that we were n't at a better stage at this thing			0
" " we 've proved that these plugs can hold back water , " said @entity51 of @entity52 , the plug 's manufacturer			1
" i wish we had moved a little bit faster as a team and had gotten this development done			1
" how giant tunnels protect @entity60 from flood threat ever @entity62 , a @entity22 professor who helped develop the idea , says he thought of the plug immediately when he saw a news report that @entity8 was closing the @entity66 in advance of the storm			1
" i said to my wife , ' it 's a pity that every tunnel does n't have two of these plugs ' , " he said			1
when he heard reports that tunnels had flooded , he said , " the first thing that came to us is maybe we have work cut out for the next 20 years			1
i think now everybody will say , ' i should have plugged this tunnel			0
' " engineers : dangling crane tied securely to @entity8 building but @entity16 project manager @entity85 , while bullish on the plug , says the plug is not ready for prime time			1
" this is an experimental prototype			0
this is something that is probably two years away or so " from real - world applications , " @entity85 said			0
" it would be like asking @entity93 , ' why ca n't i have an @entity95 6 now ? ' because it 's somewhere in the lab now			0
it 's not ready to go			2
" the plug -- simple in theory , but sophisticated in design -- inflates like a balloon to fit the contours of a tunnel , and can reduce leakage to amounts manageable by pumps			2
placed on either end of some of the tunnels under @entity8 's @entity112 , the plugs could have prevented flooding , team members told @entity1			1
but plugs would not have prevented water from infiltrating porous underground subway stations and other infrastructure , they said			1
@entity120 , @entity119 survivors offer advice to @entity15 victims in all , seven @entity8 subway tunnels and two commuter train tunnels flooded during monday 's record flooding			1
some of the tunnels were flooded from track to ceiling and " it is still too early to say how long it will take to restore the system to full service , " the @entity126 , which operates the rail systems , said wednesday			2
the @entity16 began the " @entity139 " in 2007 , focusing on the threat of terrorist gas attacks and fires in transit tunnels			1
but almost from the start , developers believed the technology could serve a dual purpose , protecting tunnels from floods during natural disasters			1
@entity15 's impact : state by state @entity16 teamed with the @entity35 , @entity22 and @entity52 , a private @entity150 company , on the project			1
an early scaled - down plug , consisting of a single layer , was effective at preventing smoke or gas penetration			2
but when the team used a stronger , single - layer plug in a full - scale inflation test , the fabric failed , sending the team " back to the drawing board , " @entity85 said			1
the current plug consists of three layers , including a tough outer layer that consists of thick webbing made of @entity166 , a liquid - crystal polymer fiber			2
the plugs must be fitted to individual tunnels			1
" when you look at these things , you get the idea of a kid 's balloon , " @entity170 said			0
but " they are not at all stretchable			0
they are specifically made to fit a tunnel of a specific dimension			0
their ability to expand or contract is less than 1 %			0
" victims fall to @entity186 's wrath the plugs can be inflated in about three minutes			2
but once inflated , they are pressurized with either air or water			2
the existing test plug is roughly 32 feet by 16 feet and holds 35,000 gallons of water			1
@entity52 , which also manufactures spacesuits for @entity193 , believes the product is ready for the marketplace			2
" i 'd say the technology is ready for implementation now , " @entity51 said			2
" what we 're doing now is in essence confidence testing , multiple deployments , just making sure			0
" if @entity8 had had plugs , " i think they could have stopped a fair amount of incursion of water in the transit system , " he said			1
team members say the plugs are cheaper than the leading alternative -- floodgates			2
the prototype plug cost about $ 400,000 , and costs could go down if the plugs are manufactured in quantities			1
" this would be a cheap solution , " said @entity62 , the @entity22 professor			0
transportation security officials initially were skeptical that a fabric device would hold back floodwaters , said @entity16 project manager @entity85			1
but that skepticism is fading , he said			0
developers said this week 's disaster in @entity8 will likely increase interest in the @entity139			2
experts warn of superstorm era to come " while we do n't want to ride the back of a disaster , it 's certainly our hope that people will look at this technology , " @entity34 said			0
" this may be the worst storm ever recorded in the last 100 years , but that 's no reason that we wo n't have another storm that will cause as much damage			0
" should @entity16 have expedited development of the plug ? that 's a hard question to answer , said terrorism expert @entity242 , director of the @entity243 at the @entity244 in @entity245 , @entity246			1
while officials can envision a wild spectrum of vulnerabilities , they have finite resources to address them , he said			0
" there are lots of solutions that become obvious following a disaster of some type , " @entity242 said			0
" to a certain extent , security is almost always reactive , because it 's hard to justify the costs of deploying technology for things that have not occurred			0
and once they do occur , it 's almost impossible to resist spending the money on the technology to prevent a reoccurrence			0
" that 's the axiom			0
it 's a sad one , but that 's the reality			0
" how you can help			0
