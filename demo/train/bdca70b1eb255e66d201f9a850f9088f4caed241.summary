-- prepare a pot of damn fine coffee and enjoy a slice of cherry pie : " @entity5 " is coming back			1
the offbeat tv series , created by @entity7 and @entity8 , will be returning to television in 2016 , according to a strange ( of course ) video posted on @entity14 's @entity13 channel			1
the original show ran on @entity16 in 1990 and 1991 and spawned a 1992 theatrical film directed by @entity7 , " @entity5 : @entity18			1
" " @entity20 ... it is happening again ... # damngoodcoffee , " @entity7 tweeted			2
according to a press release from @entity14 , " @entity5 " will be a limited series of nine episodes			1
@entity7 and @entity8 will write and produce each one and @entity7 will direct all nine			1
when it debuted , " @entity5 " was like nothing else that had ever aired on television			2
@entity7 ( then best known as the director of " @entity31 " and " @entity32 " ) and @entity8 -- who had written for " @entity34 " -- created an eerie story starring @entity36 as @entity38 agent @entity37 , who had come to the @entity40 town of @entity5 to investigate the murder of a high school girl named @entity43			1
the murder mystery was only the entry point into a bizarre world , one that was alternately drily witty and brutally violent			0
the straight - arrow @entity37 was fond of a diner 's " damn fine coffee " and pie to an almost absurd degree			0
the show featured a one - armed man , a dancing dwarf , rumblings at the local lumber mill and a malevolent spirit named @entity59			2
the tone was set with @entity62 's ghostly theme music			0
in addition to @entity36 , the show starred @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			0
" @entity5 " started off a huge hit , but as the plot became more obscure and the mood became darker , the audience dwindled , especially in the second season			2
however , those who stayed with it were a hardcore bunch , enough to prompt the theatrical film so @entity7 could tie up some loose ends ( or not , being @entity7 )			0
despite diverse reviews , the show remains one of the most influential in television history , with its involvement of a noted movie director , its willingness to take audiences to far - out places , its deliberate pace and its obsessed - about plot points and character tics			0
in many ways , it was ahead of its time			0
@entity14 plans to show the entire run of the tv series before the premiere of the new " @entity5 " episodes			1
" what more can i say -- ' @entity5 ' with @entity7 and @entity8 on @entity14 in 2016 ! " said @entity14 president @entity98			1
" to quote @entity37 , ' i have no idea where this will lead us , but i have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange			0

@entity7 , @entity8 bringing back " @entity5 "
*groundbreaking* show will return in 2016
original series aired on @entity16 in 1990 - 91
