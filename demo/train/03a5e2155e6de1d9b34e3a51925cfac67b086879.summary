@entity1 province , @entity2 -- it 's after 10 p.m. when we see a light in the distance			1
we 've traveled for more than three hours up a windy , icy road in western @entity2			1
our hope is to get to the @entity12 autonomous zone , in the mountainous region of @entity1 province , an area reportedly locked in an ever - growing spiral of violence			1
we 're so close , only an hour or so away			1
within minutes , we grind to a halt			1
a policeman is flashing a flashlight in my face			1
our @entity2 driver is already outside the car			1
we wo n't be going any farther tonight			1
roadblocks like this are strewn across the back roads of this province			2
for weeks , ethnic tibetans and @entity2 security forces have been locked in conflict			1
@entity33 nuns and monks have been carrying out ritual self - immolation			1
it is a gruesome protest against what they claim is the ongoing oppression by @entity2 authorities			1
timeline of @entity12 protests in @entity2 as our car turns back , our driver calls a @entity12 contact			1
something serious is going down			2
the @entity12 says his village is crawling with police and the military			2
later , local news reports tell of two @entity12 killed in protests			2
but many of the villages that straddle the mountains are inhabited by @entity57 , the dominant ethnic group in @entity2			1
inside the houses , lights are on , as people eat , watch tv and talk			2
we ask what they 're hearing			2
they tell us they have little time for the @entity12			2
they call them lazy and accuse them of living off government handouts			2
one woman claims the @entity57 are being targeted by violent @entity12 gangs			2
local media reports say more than a dozen people have already been killed			2
there is hysteria , bigotry and fear here			2
it is fueled by government secrecy and a constant stream of military and police vehicles			0
much of the province is in lockdown			0
in the capital city of @entity90 , police vehicles are seen moving into position at dawn			0
soon , they are on every corner , armed police patrolling the streets			0
they are tightening their grip on this heavily @entity12 populated neighborhood			0
it 's hard to get people to talk here			0
we see a group of young monks on a corner and wave them over			1
they agree to take us to their living quarters			0
here in a tiny one bedroom apartment , four beds crammed against the walls and their food tied in sacks , the monks tell us they are verbally abused and harassed by police , pushed to breaking point			1
" i can not bear it any longer - any more , " says one			1
they are far from their home in the mountains ; cut off they say , they can not even make contact by phone			0
" we want to go but we can not , you can see all the security out there			0
wherever you go , they see you			0
we can not go anywhere , " he says			0
we ask if he 's afraid , but he just looks at a picture of the @entity133 , a smile on his face			0
" i ca n't explain , " he says , " but i 'm not afraid			0
" in their pouch , the monks hold a keepsake of their spiritual leader the @entity140 , too sacred to even show us			1
this pouch , they say , carries a dream			0
" we wish what all @entity12 wish for the most : for the @entity140 to return to the palace in @entity145			1
" they know about the self - immolation of other @entity147 ; they say they support them and vow it will continue until @entity2 leaves @entity145			1
for the @entity2 government , though , these are dangerous men -- part of what they call a " splittist " element , determined to tear @entity145 from @entity2			1
throughout our interview , we have been watched			0
later , our vehicle is followed			0
our driver says his family has received threatening phone calls			0
on our way to the airport , a car , rather suspiciously , rams into the back of our taxi			0
as we make our way to the service counters , we are followed by plainclothes security talking constantly on mobile phones			0
eventually trying to clear airport security , we 're grabbed by police			0
we are marched to an airport police station and detained and questioned for five hours			0
police keep some of our video			0
they want to know who we spoke to , what we are doing here , where we 've been and why we want to cover this story			0
we have our own questions -- questions authorities are answering only with roadblocks and police			1
later , @entity2 authorities black out @entity185 when our report airs about the situation in the ethnically @entity12 area			1
there are claims and counter-claims in this dark conflict			0
all of it is being played out behind a veil of secrecy in the mountains of western @entity2 .			1
