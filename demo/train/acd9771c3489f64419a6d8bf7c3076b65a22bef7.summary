amid all the talk of @entity7 's new - found domination of @entity9 football after the success of @entity11 and @entity12 in reaching the @entity14 final , @entity1 ' achievement of winning the @entity3 title for a record - extending 29th time almost passed by without notice at the weekend			1
it was @entity1 's second consecutive @entity17 crown and provided further testimony to the impact coach @entity19 has had given he has only been in charge since mid- 2011			1
like all successful coaches , @entity19 has already turned his thoughts to the future rather than the past as he called for renewed investment from the club to enable him to take the team forward			0
" @entity19 the man definitely wants to stay at @entity1 , " he had said prior to sunday 's 1 - 0 win over @entity30 , which confirmed @entity1 's title success			1
" however there is also @entity19 the professional , who needs to sit down with the club			0
i 've left big jobs before when i did n't believe in the club 's plans			0
" back in april , @entity19 had lamented his team 's lack of spending power when the ' @entity1 ' of @entity3 football lost to @entity11 in the @entity14 quarterfinals			1
" if you have money , you buy players and you win , " said @entity19 after @entity1 's exit			1
" there are superpowers like @entity50 , @entity11 , @entity51 and @entity52 who have a turnover of $ 524 million			0
" but if @entity1 has n't yet been able to replicate its prowess of the mid- 1990s in @entity58 's top club competition following the match - fixing scandal of seven years ago , relief might be on the way			1
if an @entity3 side is to break through in the @entity14 , @entity1 , which appeared in three straight @entity14 finals between 1996 and 1998 , will be the most likely candidate , not a rebuilding @entity64			1
unlike most other @entity3 teams , @entity1 's financial outlook is n't gloomy			1
long backed by car manufacturer @entity67 and owning its own , newer stadium -- bucking the trend in @entity3 -- that replaced the eyesore of the @entity71 gives @entity1 a sizable head start			1
the good times domestically could kick - start a run in @entity58 , according to an @entity3 football expert			1
" they have can a massive advantage domestically , and i think in the long run , that 's going to give them the ability to challenge in the @entity14 , " @entity83 , author of @entity84 : a history of @entity86 and a professor of modern @entity3 history at @entity89 , told @entity90			1
" i do n't think they 're that far away			0
they 've done this thing which all the other @entity3 teams find very difficult to do or have the will to do , which is to move to the @entity97 model of having their own stadium , which is a cash cow			2
" i think they 're extremely well managed and the scandal is behind them , " added @entity101 , referring to the " @entity105 " match - fixing scandal which saw the club stripped of its 2005 and 2006 titles			1
according to the 2013 version of the @entity110 , a list of the highest earning clubs in football , @entity1 placed 10th with revenues of $ 256 million in 2011/2012			2
@entity1 was the second - highest ranked @entity3 team , two spots behind @entity64			1
television package more encouragingly for @entity1 , though , was an increase of around $ 52 million from the previous term -- bettering @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity119 , the top three clubs on the list			2
and @entity1 did top @entity11 in one revenue stream -- broadcast revenues			2
continual appearances in the @entity14 , coupled with the new stadium , will only help matters			0
@entity1 posted a profit of $ 14.8 million in the first half of 2012/2013 , and although it said it expects the full - year figure to be in the red , losses are anticipated to be less than last season 's $ 64 million and far less than 2010/2011 's club record deficit of $ 124 million			1
the @entity3 champions are said to be in discussions with @entity135 , already a sponsor of the team , over naming rights to the stadium and a shirt sponsorship pact that could bring in $ 157 million			2
but when @entity19 refers to @entity1 and other @entity3 teams lagging behind other football powerhouses , he is fully justified given @entity50 's revenue figure of $ 672.6 million headed the @entity110 list			1
despite @entity146 being a relatively new player in world football , @entity146 's matchday revenues outdid those of @entity1			2
the @entity151 club 's broadcast revenues were inferior to the likes of @entity119 , @entity146 , @entity153 and @entity154 , who benefit from the @entity157 's multi-billion pound television rights deal			0
@entity17 's overseas television rights deal , the @entity159 reported last fall , was a mere one - sixth of the @entity157			1
perhaps an indication of its lessening appeal , @entity17 -- dissimilar to the @entity157 , @entity164 and the @entity165 -- does n't have a jersey sponsor for its match officials			1
" one of the problems of @entity17 is that it 's difficult to see it , " @entity83 said			2
" there 's not a package , which is worse than it was in the ' 90s			0
" call for reform @entity1 president @entity176 wants change in @entity3 football , and so too does retired @entity64 and @entity3 great @entity179 , part of the @entity64 team that beat @entity19 and @entity1 in all an - @entity3 @entity14 final in 2003			1
" if you go outside the @entity186 you can see people selling fake merchandising , " he told @entity184 news agency in april			0
" it was like that when i started to play and it is still like that now			0
you ca n't allow this			0
then you have old stadiums , very old stadiums			0
@entity186 is a historic stadium			0
it 's nice but does n't offer comfort ... we have to improve it			0
" above all we need to learn from leagues that make money from sports rather than lose money			0
" @entity19 echoed those thoughts after @entity1 's @entity14 exit			2
i think we need to change @entity3 football and when i say we i mean us , the other clubs , media , fans and institutions , " he said			2
" abroad they invest money in projects , here we talk about referees and what cars the players are driving			0
" on the pitch @entity1 did n't do as well as last season , which was not a surprise since it finished unbeaten in @entity17 in 2011/2012			1
yet the margin of victory was still impressive			0
@entity1 pulled away from @entity222 and by the end of the weekend held a 11 - point lead			1
without benefiting from the individual brilliance of a @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 or @entity229 , @entity1 relied on a balanced attack and various sources to hit the back of the net			2
@entity234 came from more than playmaker @entity235 , too			0
before sunday 's win over @entity30 , four @entity1 players had more assists than @entity235			1
@entity19 's team was marshalled at the back by three notable @entity3 internationals , keeper @entity242 and central defenders @entity243 and @entity245			2
a deal with @entity135 would help @entity1 in its chase of summer targets and bolster its @entity9 prospects next season			0
@entity251 of @entity51 , who has n't shown his @entity253 form in @entity254 , @entity52 's @entity3 playmaker @entity255 , and talismanic striker @entity256 -- a former @entity1 players -- have all been linked with the @entity3 champions			1
it all points to a promising period for @entity1			0
maybe the glory days in @entity58 will return sooner than @entity19 anticipated			0
" what @entity176 goes on about now is the system must be reformed , " @entity83 said			0
" but he has done more than anyone else domestically , so i think @entity1 are in a good position			0

@entity1 secure second successive @entity17 title with 1 - 0 win over @entity30
success was record 29th @entity3 title for @entity1
