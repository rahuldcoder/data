-- some drivers would say that the @entity2 is a crazy quilt of speed limits , with an emphasis on the " crazy			1
" a sign indicating the highest speed limit in the country stands by @entity9 outside of the @entity11 town of @entity12			1
since 1995 , states have been free to set their own maximum speed limits , leading to long debates on safety standards			1
to some folks , the speed limits are just insane -- either too low or too high , depending on their views about what makes driving safe			1
advocates of low speed limits wo n't find much to like about @entity11			1
true to its frontier roots , it stands out as the land of the fast getaway			0
the top rural speed limit is normally 70 mph , but in 2006 it set a maximum daytime speed of 80 miles per hour , the highest speed limit on the country , on more than 500 miles of rural interstate in its southwest corner			1
this includes parts of @entity9 between @entity35 and @entity12 and of @entity36 between @entity37 and the @entity9 interchange			2
the speed limit for rural roads in @entity41 is 75 mph			2
as a result , it takes just three hours to travel the 228 miles from @entity44 to @entity45 at the posted speed			2
but that 's much slower than a @entity41 driver could have made the trip in early 1999			0
at that time there was a six - month speeders ' honeymoon when the state had almost no control over rural speeds , partly as a result of an unfavorable court ruling			2
@entity58 in the @entity59 is at or near the other end of the spectrum			0
in the @entity2 territory the speed limit is 20 mph in the city and 30 out in the country			2
when it comes to accident rates , though , you would be far better off on a @entity41 interstate than competing with the island 's frenetic drivers on the way to @entity74			0
nationwide , maximum speeds range from 60 miles per hour in @entity76 to 75 in most of the @entity11			1
meanwhile , much of the eastern @entity77 and the @entity78 has opted for maximum speeds of 65 mph , although @entity80 and @entity81 chose the 70 mph standard more common to the @entity83 and the @entity85 states			0
so if you are cruising west along @entity86 out of @entity87 , you can enjoy the increase in speed across 150 miles of @entity81 before @entity91 ' lower speed limit -- or its state police -- reins you in			2
as you continue west , interstate speed limits bump up to 70 in @entity95 , and then you can maintain a steady 75 from @entity96 through to the @entity98 line , where interstate speeds drop off to 70 again			1
should you choose to detour into @entity100 , you 're back down to 65			0
from a highway safety standpoint , the patchwork of speed limits at least seems to make sense			1
speeds are slower in more populous eastern states and faster in the wide - open @entity11 , although the @entity107 argues that some of the new , higher speed limits out @entity11 and elsewhere are costing lives			1
it estimates that deaths on interstates and freeways have increased 15 percent due to the higher speed limits			1
but some researchers are skeptical about the link between accidents and high speeds on rural highways , if not on city streets and rural two - lanes			1
they point to the lower fatality rates on @entity125 highways , even though the speeds are generally higher			0
the maximum legal speed is roughly 80 mph in @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and a few other countries			2
there is no speed limit on much of @entity135 's autobahn , although some sections are restricted to about 80 mph or less			2
ironically , the new regime of @entity2 speed limits has helped researchers make sense of whether higher rural speed limits are dangerous			1
political scientist @entity142 , a professor at @entity143 in @entity11 , examined what happened after states began setting higher rural speed limits in 1995			1
with the federal 65 mph limit gone , it was possible to compare the accident rates before and after the new limits went into effect			0
the results were clear : " @entity154 and large , across the 50 states , there was no discernible effect from the higher limits , " @entity142 said			0
" two or three states actually had a decrease in fatalities			0
" once speed limits are raised on interstates , drivers are more likely to get off the more dangerous two lanes and use the faster routes , @entity142 said			1
furthermore , the motorists traveling the fastest on the higher - speed interstates tend to be good at that kind of driving			0
the less competent drivers at high speeds tend to drive more slowly			1
while @entity142 admits most states are well - intentioned , he 's " not willing to accept that speed limits are solely a function of safety , " he said			1
" they are a function of revenue generation as well			0
there have been cases of judges saying communities have to raise their speed limits because they were obviously being used to raise revenues and that 's not a proper use of the law			1
" in part , @entity142 looks to differences in political cultures to explain the great continental divide in speed limits			1
" it may be that certain states have a different approach to questions involving personal liberty versus collective safety , " he said			0
his research does n't surprise @entity200 , president of the @entity202 , @entity203 - based @entity201			0
his organization had lobbied heavily for an end to the federal limits			0
@entity200 's rule of thumb for computing the right speed limit is the traffic engineering standard known as the 85th percentile speed			0
that 's the speed that 85 percent of motorists drive at or below			0
but it tends to be well above the speed limits that most jurisdictions set			1
with the speed limit set at that level , traffic tends to move smoothly , reducing the risk of accidents , @entity200 said			2
if you put the limit below that speed , some vehicles are traveling far more slowly than the fastest drivers , creating the most dangerous conditions of all			2
@entity200 argues that most drivers naturally tend to drive at speeds that suit the road conditions and their driving skills			2
@entity58 is a case in point , albeit an extreme one			0
with its congestion and rugged terrain , the island is bereft of performance cars ; many of the vehicles are older pickups , aging @entity242 compacts and suvs			0
the treacherous conditions restrict speeds far more effectively than any local law			0
as @entity248 , executive director of the @entity58 - @entity249 , puts it , " even if you wanted to go a whole lot faster , you could n't , " he said			0
