@entity0 -- a federal government advisory committee voted tuesday to recommend that males ages 11 to 21 be vaccinated against the human papilloma virus , which is blamed for thousands of cases of cancer among women and men			1
the @entity10 's @entity9 said the vaccine series can be started as early as age 9			1
twelve members of the committee voted in favor of a recommendation that 11 - and 12 - year - old boys be vaccinated ; one member abstained			1
in a separate vote involving males age 13 to 21 , eight voted in favor ; five against , and one abstained			2
the same recommendation said men ages 22 through 26 may be vaccinated			2
much of the debate focused on whether it would be cost - effective to vaccinate boys against @entity28			2
the vaccine is administered over a six - month period in three doses , each of which costs about $ 120			0
dr. s. @entity33 , clinical professor of pediatrics at the @entity35 and a member of the group that devised the recommendations , said the cost to vaccinate 11 - and 12 - year - old boys would be $ 38 million			0
" we have the money , we just have to set the priorities , " he said			0
" if we do n't , i do n't know who will			0
" @entity28 is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the @entity46			1
at least half of sexually active people will get it at some point in their lives			2
why vaccinate middle schoolers ? experts say that it 's important to immunize people before they become sexually active			2
according to the @entity58 , which studies sexual health , 13 % of 15 - year - olds have had vaginal sex			0
by 19 , that figure has risen to 70 %			0
the vaccine is less effective after a person is sexually active			2
study : males should get hpv vaccine too the hpv votes took place as part of the advisory committee 's meeting in @entity0			1
the vaccine is 89 % effective against genital warts in males and 75 % effective against anal cancer in males , according to @entity10			1
the hpv vaccine is already recommended for females between the ages of 9 and 26 to reduce the risk of cervical cancer			1
the @entity10 recommends girls also get the vaccine at age 11 or 12			1
the @entity84 approved the first hpv vaccine , @entity85 , in 2006			1
a second vaccine , @entity86 , was approved in 2009			1
@entity85 protects against most genital warts and anal , vaginal and vulvar cancers , all of which are associated with @entity28 , according to the disease agency			1
although the vaccine has been approved for males since 2009 , it has n't been as heavily promoted for them			1
increase in oral cancers linked to @entity28 one reason for the push now is that girls are n't getting vaccinated in the numbers doctors had expected			1
" if the boys are also immunized , it reduces the transmission back and forth , " said dr. @entity102 , chairman of the @entity103 at @entity104 , who attended the @entity10 meeting as an adviser but not a voting member			2
in addition , the committee voted to recommend that men who have sex with men up to age 26 be vaccinated against @entity28 because that would protect them from cancers of the penis and rectum			1
there also is growing evidence that @entity28 is responsible for a recent increase in head and neck cancer			2
a study published this month found approximately 70 % of all oropharyngeal cancers are caused by @entity28			2
oropharyngeal cancers are those that form in the middle of the throat behind the mouth , an area that includes the back third of the tongue , the soft palate , the side and back walls of the throat and the tonsils			0
this year , the @entity139 added the hpv vaccine to its list of recommended vaccines for boys			1
a new study suggests that @entity28 may also be linked to cardiovascular disease			1
researchers from the @entity147 at @entity148 studied 2,450 women ages 20 to 59 who had participated in a national survey from 2003 to 2006 and found that 1,141 women tested positive for @entity28			1
of them , 573 had cancer - associated hpv types			0
those whose who tested positive for @entity28 were 2.3 times more likely to have said they suffered a stroke or heart attack , the authors found			0
that odds ratio went up to 2.86 when women with cancer - associated hpv types were compared with women who had no such infections , according to the study , which was published in the @entity165			0
" nearly 20 % of individuals with @entity167 ( cardiovascular disease ) do not show any risk factors , indicating that other ' nontraditional ' causes may be involved in the development of the disease ; @entity28 appears to be one such factor among women , " dr. @entity173 , the lead author of the study and director of the division of cardiology at the @entity147 said in a news release			1
" this has important clinical implications			0
first , the hpv vaccine may also help prevent heart disease			1
second , physicians should monitor patients with cancer - associated @entity28 to prevent heart attack and stroke , as well as @entity28 patients already diagnosed with @entity167 to avoid future cardiovascular events			0
" but an accompanying editorial , by dr. @entity193 , a cardiologist at @entity194 in @entity195 , @entity196 , pointed out weaknesses in the study that make it difficult to point to a causal effect			0
he noted the small number of infected patients , their relative youth , the fact that it depended on their recall of their history and the fact that no adjustment was made for their socioeconomic status			0
he called for further work to be done			0
the results " may just apply to a certain subset of people with genetic early atherosclerosis , " said dr. @entity212 , director of clinical research at the @entity214 and @entity215 at @entity216 in @entity0			0
" not every person who has @entity28 is going to get cancer , it may be that only those kinds that have a link to cancer will have a link to cardiovascular disease , " said @entity212 , who also called for further studies before reaching " hard and fast " conclusions			2
the hpv vaccine became a political hot potato when @entity234 presidential contender @entity233 criticized fellow @entity234 contender and @entity238 gov. @entity237 's support of the vaccine for girls			1
in 2007 , he signed an executive order that required @entity238 schoolgirls to receive vaccinations against @entity28			0
the order ended up not being implemented			0
the @entity10 notes that the @entity84 has licensed the vaccines as safe and effective			0
" both vaccines were tested in thousands of people around the world			0
these studies showed no serious safety concerns			1
common , mild adverse events reported during these studies include pain where the shot was given , fever , dizziness , and nausea , " according to the @entity10 website			0
@entity1 's @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to this report .			0

@entity10 : tests on thousands of people show " no serious safety concerns "
