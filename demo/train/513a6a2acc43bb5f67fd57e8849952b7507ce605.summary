@entity0 -- what the hell do we @entity2 do now ? in the very short run , our course is obvious enough : there will be more votes on health care in the @entity10 , and we will vote nay again			1
but this is anti-climax territory			0
the decisive vote occurred sunday night			0
the " what next ? " question pertains to the days further ahead , after president @entity14 signs the merged @entity16 - @entity10 legislation and " @entity19 " becomes the law of the land			0
some @entity2 talk of repealing the whole bill			1
that 's not very realistic			1
even supposing that @entity2 miraculously capture both houses of @entity25 in november , repeal will require a presidential signature			1
more relevantly : do @entity2 write a one - sentence bill declaring that the whole thing is repealed ? will they vote to reopen the " doughnut " hole for prescription drugs for seniors ? to allow health insurers to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions ? to kick millions of people off @entity38 ? it 's unimaginable , impossible			1
but there are things that can be done , and here are some early priorities : 1 ) one of the worst things about the @entity46 ' plan is the method of financing : an increase in tax on high - income earners			0
at first that tax bites only a very small number , but the new taxes will surely be applied to larger and larger portions of the @entity57 population over time			1
@entity2 champion lower taxes and faster economic growth			1
we need to start thinking now about how to get rid of these new taxes on work , saving and investment -- if necessary by finding other sources of revenue , including carbon taxes			2
2 ) we should quit defending employment - based health care			1
the leading @entity2 spokesman in the @entity16 on these issues , rep. @entity69 , repeatedly complained during floor debate that the @entity14 plan would " dump " people out of employer - provided care into the exchanges			1
he said that as if it were a bad thing			0
yet free - market economists from @entity79 onward have identified employer - provided care as the original sin of @entity57 health care			1
employers choose different policies for employees than those employees would choose for themselves			0
wages are depressed without employees understanding why			0
the day when every employee in @entity57 gets his or her insurance through an exchange will be a good day for market economics			0
it 's true that the exchanges are subsidized			2
so is employer - provided care , to the tune of almost $ 200 billion a year			2
3 ) we should call for reducing regulation of the policies sold inside the health care exchanges			1
the @entity46 ' plans require every policy sold within the exchanges to meet certain strict conditions			0
@entity57 workers will lose the option of buying more basic but cheaper plans			0
it will be as if the only cable packages available were those that include all the premium channels			0
no bargains in that case			0
republicans should press for more scope for insurers to cut prices if they think they can offer an attractive product that way			0
4 ) the @entity46 plan requires businesses with payrolls more than $ 500,000 to buy health insurance for their workers or face fines of $ 2,000 per worker			1
could there be a worse time to heap this new mandate on smaller employers ? health insurance comes out of employee wages , plain and simple			2
employers who do not offer health insurance must compete for labor against those who do -- and presumably pay equivalent wages for equivalent work			2
uninsured employees have now through the exchanges been provided an easy and even subsidized way to buy their own coverage			0
there is no justification for the small - business fine : republicans should press for repeal			2
that platform is ambitious enough -- but also workable , enactable and likely to appeal to voters			0
after 18 months of overheated rhetoric , it 's time at last for @entity2 to get real			1
i 've been on a soapbox for months now about the harm that our overheated talk is doing to us			2
yes , it mobilizes supporters -- but by mobilizing them with hysterical accusations and pseudo-information , overheated talk has made it impossible for representatives to represent and elected leaders to lead			2
now the overheated talk is about to get worse			2
over the past 48 hours , i 've heard conservatives compare the @entity16 bill to the @entity168 of 1854 -- a decisive step on the path to the @entity171			2
conservatives have whipped themselves into spasms of outrage and despair that block all strategic thinking			0
the vitriolic talking heads on conservative talk radio and shock tv have very different imperatives from people in government			1
talk radio thrives on confrontation and recrimination			1
when @entity187 said that he wanted @entity14 to fail , he was intelligently explaining his own interests			0
what he omitted to say -- but what is equally true -- is that he also wants @entity2 to fail			1
if @entity2 succeed -- if they govern successfully in office and negotiate attractive compromises out of office -- @entity187 's listeners get less angry			1
and if they are less angry , they listen to the radio less and hear fewer ads for @entity198 beds			0
so today 's defeat for free - market economics and @entity2 values is a huge win for the conservative entertainment industry			1
their listeners and viewers will be even more enraged , even more frustrated , even more disappointed in everybody except the responsibility - free talkers on television and radio			0
for them , it 's mission accomplished			0
for the cause they purport to represent , however , the " @entity219 " threatened by @entity2 sen. @entity217 last year regarding @entity14 and health care has finally arrived all right : only it turns out to be our own			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			1

@entity225 says @entity2 suffered a big defeat with *passage* of health care
@entity225 says it 's not realistic to think the bill 's benefits , which will be popular , can be repealed
he says @entity2 can pledge to stave off higher taxes and more regulation of small businesses
@entity240 : strategy served interests of talk radio by whipping up anger but led @entity2 astray
