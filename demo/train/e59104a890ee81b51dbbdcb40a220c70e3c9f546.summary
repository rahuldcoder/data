if @entity1 runs for president in 2016 , @entity0 will be her closest political adviser and confidant			1
so when the former president laid out a detailed @entity8 platform after being asked how he would advise a presidential candidate , the connection to @entity1 's possible presidential run was not far from anyone 's mind , including @entity0 's			1
" let 's assume that you are advising a presidential candidate , " @entity12 said in an interview that was taped monday at the @entity15 meeting in @entity16			1
" that 's a heavy assumption , " @entity0 said with a laugh			2
" my advice has sometimes been welcome , sometimes not			0
sometimes right and sometimes not			0
" @entity0 said that in presidential campaigns , " the past is relevant insofar as it 's an indication of what might happen in the future , " but he was clear to say that " by and large , almost all elections are about the future			2
" here are , according to @entity0 , the forward - looking policies a presidential candidate , and possibly a president , will have to focus on : economic growth : " well first on the home front , we need a table plan that has the prospect of restoring more rapid growth that actually generates jobs and raises incomes and gives poor people a chance to work their way from poverty into the middle class			1
i think that 's really important			0
the most likely way to do that is flowing investments into areas that we know will create a lot of jobs and that simultaneously will change the job mix. " energy and infrastructure investment : " a much more vigorous orientation toward the future , that is making future - related investments like a modern electrical grid			2
" " i think the most reasonable , easy , low - hanging fruit targets are a revived effort in the energy area and particularly in making all these buildings in @entity63 more efficient			0
and then other kinds of infrastructure			0
" health care : " i think secondly , continuing to work on the health care system is important because the four - year hiatus we 've had in health care inflation , we 've got to keep it going			1
i do n't care what anybody says ; the federal health care law that expanded @entity74 to working people with low incomes and their kids was a big boon			1
" education : " then you 've got to do , you 've got to keep working on education and reform the student loan problem and figure out a way to deliver online or in person much more affordable higher education			0
and we have to erase , totally erase , the difference between technical and academic education			0
" reforming the corporate tax rate : " we should bring the money home			1
the corporate money that 's been lodged overseas can be brought home ; the corporations have told us how to do it			1
whether we like it or not , this inversion , this is their money			0
and we are going to have to have a more competitive corporate tax system			2

@entity0 lays out @entity8 platform he would suggest for a presidential candidate
connection to @entity1 , his wife and possible candidate , was not lost on anyone
economic growth , energy investment , health care focus , education among his top *issues*
he also suggested bringing " corporate money " home by reforming the tax code
