-- the @entity1 and @entity2 have gone head - to - head in thousands of broadband tests , and the numbers tell the story you 'd expect : @entity9 's network is much faster			1
@entity10 , creators of the @entity10 broadband test , compiled data from tests run by @entity2 customers using the @entity10 app on both @entity9 and @entity1			1
on average , the reported @entity2 transfer rates were roughly two times faster than the @entity19 's			2
the @entity21 's average download speed was 1,769 kbps , and the average upload speed was 730 kbps			0
by way of comparison , the @entity1 's average download speed was 848 kbps , and the average upload speed was 506 kbps			2
the results come from 43,000 @entity27 and 14,000 @entity28 all over the @entity29			0
most @entity10 app users ran the tests multiple times , totaling 106,000 results from @entity2 users and 49,000 results from @entity19 users			1
the @entity10 results did not provide data on coverage reliability or dropped connections			0
from my benchmarking of the @entity19 versus the @entity2 , i also found that the @entity21 's @entity44 transfer rates were much faster than @entity1 's			1
however , the @entity2 sometimes could not complete tests because it did not have a connection , whereas the @entity1 successfully completed every test			1
in short , i found the @entity19 to be slower with network transfers but more reliable with coverage			2
reviewers at other publications had the same results			0
" i think that 's the story i expected to see , " said @entity53 , co-founder of @entity10			0
" @entity1 has never talked up their speed , but they always talk up coverage and reliability ...			0
i think the story is quality versus throughput : what are you after ? " @entity10 's nationwide results back my verdict : you should get a @entity19 if you really care about voice quality and calls , but the @entity2 is better as a media - consumption device ( @entity69 movies , photo downloads and uploads , etc. ) because of its faster speeds			1
