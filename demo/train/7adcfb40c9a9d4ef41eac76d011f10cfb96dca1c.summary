-- it 's easy to understand why travelers venture to some of the world 's largest cities			1
they are often packed with gorgeous architecture , delicious food , fabulous art institutions , endless shopping and unparalleled entertainment and nightlife			2
yet there are potential downsides to a high density of culture			2
bustling metropolises usually attract massive crowds , frustrating traffic and deafening noise			2
for those looking for some respite , book a room in hotels sequestered away in quieter quadrants of these respective cities			2
take two - year - old @entity26 in @entity29 's @entity28 neighborhood			1
while most hotels and @entity32 in @entity34 's capital are concentrated in buzzier @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , @entity26 's less - central address offers quiet nights and crowd - free streets — and the city 's best restaurants , lounges and shopping are just a 10 - minute taxi ride away			1
if places like this are still too close for comfort , opt to inch even farther out of the center at an accommodation situated in the outlying areas of a city			2
if you decide to book one of the grand resorts in @entity58 's @entity57 region , you wo n't be within walking distance of the city 's major tourist points , but you might not want to be : the @entity63 house some of @entity58 's most over-the - top resorts , including @entity65			1
the hotel does n't skimp on luxury amenities — with two palaces and a private jet — so even though it is off the beaten path , it still has everything			1
@entity73 , @entity74 staying in one of the @entity74 's most - popular arrondissements — any of the first five , for instance — will prove to be a crowded proposition			1
go for @entity73 's original @entity80 outpost , hidden in the westernmost reaches of @entity74 in the 16th @entity82 , where your sidewalk companions are @entity86 - toting locals , not fanny - packed tourists			1
this leafy residential neighborhood is the perfect setting for @entity73 's opulence , which becomes obvious as soon as you see its grand , historical building , previously home to @entity94 , @entity95 's grandnephew			1
the interior is like a modernized palace , complete with an impressive art collection , atmospheric library , marble furnishings and @entity102 - starred dining venues			2
rooms , from $ 865 ; 10 @entity104 ; 33 - 1/53 - 67 - 19 - 98 ; shangri - la.com			2
departures : @entity107 's top walking cities the @entity108 , @entity109 in @entity109 , seek solace from buzzing markets and traffic - jammed streets at the months - old @entity108			1
it is the only hotel in the @entity115 district , which is surrounded by temples and palaces and is located on the northern bank of the @entity119 , near the @entity120			1
plus , all 39 rooms here , including 10 villas with private pools ( the @entity108 is the only retreat in the @entity108 capital to offer such luxury ) , are spread over three acres of private gardens			0
if you crave total anonymity , look no further			0
even the chemical - free @entity130 by @entity131 caters to the mega-recluse : the nearly 11,000 - square - foot spa has just five treatment suites , each with its own steam shower and pneumatic bed			0
rooms , from $ 530 ; 3/2 @entity139 , @entity140 ; 66 - 0/2206 - 6999 ; thesiamhotel.com			0
@entity141 , @entity142 for a city that straddles two continents , it 's almost unfair that in @entity142 nearly everything a traveler is encouraged to see is on the @entity80 side of town			1
this is exactly why you should opt to stay on the @entity153 half at the stylish , 20 - room @entity141 ( a former raki factory )			1
while it may not offer lightning - quick access to the @entity158 , it does feature stunning , uncluttered views of the @entity160 without the tourist din that haunts more central neighborhoods like @entity163 or @entity164			1
@entity167 's perch on the water — minutes away from authentic fish restaurants and produce markets — and sleek , no - fuss decor make total relaxation easy			1
for hardcore sightseeing , @entity167 's reliable and complimentary private boat service travels to @entity80 in as little as 15 minutes			2
rooms , from $ 250 ; @entity175 51 ; 90 - 216/422 - 8000 ; sumahan.com			0
departures : undiscovered ski locations @entity178 , @entity179 located in art - heavy @entity180 , @entity178 — the first @entity182 property from @entity184 hospitality giant @entity183 — and its area attract gallery - hopping @entity179 and international jet - set types			1
as far as location goes , it remains within walking distance of some of the hottest restaurants and bars in the @entity193			0
designed by @entity194 -- based architect @entity195 , the ten - story , mesh - wrapped boutique hotel has 56 simple yet striking rooms ( some suites come equipped with gas fireplaces ) , a rooftop pool that is transformed into a hot tub when temperatures drop and a terrace eatery that serves @entity205 fare in the summer and @entity207 dishes in the winter			1
rooms , from $ 265 ; 518 w. 27th st. ; 212 - 525 - 0000 ; hotel - americano.com			2
@entity26 , @entity29 , @entity34 though not as popular as other major @entity80 destinations , @entity29 is no sleepy town			0
because of its highly regarded hostels , relatively lower prices and mild year - round climate , it attracts students and budget travelers			0
they generally crowd the downtown neighborhoods , including @entity37 , @entity29 's loud nightlife center			2
make a beeline for two - year - old @entity26 in @entity28 , a central neighborhood whose most interesting points of reference are mom - and - pop shops , relaxing parks and 18th - century churches			0
when weather permits , try the hotel 's quaint dining program ( an extension of the popular basement - level @entity231 ) on the adjacent lawn			1
instead of reserving a table , sign up for an outdoor picnic towel and lunch on the grass			0
rooms , from $ 155 ; @entity238 35 ; 35 - 1/21 - 190 - 0100 ; hoteldaestrela.com			0
departures : perfect @entity179 hotel rooms hotel @entity241 , @entity242 with a population that exceeds six million and growing tourism , @entity242 is one of the most energetic cities on the globe			1
mountains , the ocean and undeniable @entity250 passion have won @entity242 many fans			0
when most of them unpack in @entity255 or @entity256 , head to the mountaintop @entity241 neighborhood , where traffic jams and high - rises give way to red - tiled homes , cobblestone streets and trees			0
at the 40 - room @entity269 , situated in a preserved colonial building in the middle of 43,000 square feet of gorgeously landscaped greenery , chic , tropical - inspired design awaits via burned - cement floors , tropical woods , black - and - gold limestone slate and @entity34 tiles , as well as art from all regions of the country			0
rooms , from $ 470 ; @entity278 660 ; 55 - 21/3380 - 0200 ; santa - teresa - hotel.com			0
@entity65 , @entity58 the challenge of a stay in @entity283 's newest gem ( part of the @entity285 ) is that it may prevent you from venturing out to explore			1
its location in the @entity290 , at the foot of the @entity288 , means you are a drive away from the town square of @entity292 and its snake charmers , the @entity294 and thumping nightclubs like @entity297 import @entity296			0
but do not be ashamed to laze around the grounds and be spoiled by nearly 540,000 square feet of scented and masterfully manicured @entity300 - inspired gardens , cascading waterfalls and tranquil lakes			0
there are casual dining options here , but @entity306 restaurant is a culinary masterpiece that overlooks the main pool			0
