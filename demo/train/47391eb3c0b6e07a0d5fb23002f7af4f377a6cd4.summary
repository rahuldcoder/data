-- a professor who compared some victims of the @entity4 attack on the @entity5 to @entity6 was fired tuesday by the @entity8 's @entity7			1
professor @entity9 wrote that some 9/11 victims were " little eichmanns			2
" @entity9 raised hackles with a 2002 essay that argued the september 11 , 2001 , attacks were a justified reaction to @entity17 policies in the @entity18 , and said the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 had " the courage of their convictions			1
" but the regents said @entity9 's firing was unrelated to the essay , which went largely unnoticed for three years			2
instead , it cited " deliberate and repeated research misconduct			0
" a university investigation had found cases of plagiarism and falsification in previous papers by @entity9 -- allegations that surfaced after his essay became widely known			1
" the board of regents affirms that its decisions in this matter have been made solely on the basis of the allegations of research misconduct against professor @entity9 and have not been influenced or motivated by extrinsic considerations , professor @entity9 's political and social views or a desire to punish professor @entity9 for expression of his political or social views , " the university announced			0
@entity8 interim chancellor @entity54 recommended @entity9 's dismissal in june 2006 after a university committee completed its investigation			1
@entity9 's essay drew little notice until a 1,800 - student college in @entity61 invited him to take part in a 2005 forum on prisons and native american rights			0
the invitation was rescinded after criticism from then - @entity21 gov. @entity68 , then - @entity70 gov. @entity69 and hundreds of relatives of those killed in the attacks created a media firestorm			0
the piece had called some of those who died in the @entity5 " little eichmanns " -- a reference to @entity83 , the @entity84 officer who was one of the chief architects of the @entity86 -- arguing they were " a technocratic corps at the very heart of @entity17 's global financial empire			0
" @entity9 , who had tenure , stepped down from his post as head of @entity8 's ethnic studies department amid the flap but remained on staff			1
he had no immediate reaction to tuesday 's decision			0
