-- @entity3 acted swiftly after their worst home defeat in 16 years to dispense with the services of manager @entity6 , the @entity2 club announced monday			1
@entity8 's 5 - 0 thrashing of @entity3 sunday left the north @entity10 club in seventh place , five points below the @entity14 places and eight adrift of leaders @entity17			1
it followed a 6 - 0 loss to @entity20 last month and a tally of just 15 goals in 16 @entity2 games this season			1
" the club can announce that agreement has been reached with head coach , @entity6 , for the termination of his services , " read a short statement on the @entity3 website			1
" the decision was by mutual consent and in the interests of all parties			0
we wish @entity37 for the future			0
we shall make a further announcement in due course			0
" @entity6 , 36 , spent 17 months in charge of @entity3 , taking over from @entity42 before the start of last season			1
inspired by @entity45 , @entity3 achieved their best ever @entity2 points tally of 72 , but narrowly missed out on a @entity14 place to their arch - rivals @entity17			1
@entity45 's world record sale to @entity49 in the transfer window preceded a spending spree by @entity3 as they invested a reported Â £ 105 million ( $ 171 million ) on new players			0
results have been mixed , with a 100 per cent record in qualifying for the last 32 of the @entity55 -- where they have been drawn against @entity57 -- and progress to the quarterfinals of the @entity60 with a match against @entity62 wednesday			0
but the pressure began to build after a sorry display against @entity20 , combined with earlier disappointing @entity2 home defeats to @entity62 and @entity66			2
sunday 's reverse , inspired by @entity68 , left @entity6 in an unenviable position , although he was defiant to the last			0
" the call to make that decision is not mine because obviously i wo n't resign and i 'm not a quitter , " he told gathered reporter after the @entity8 match			2
" the only thing i can do is work hard with the players to get them back on track			0
this is a top - four squad but in our @entity2 form we are not there , " he admitted			2
@entity6 previously spent nine months in charge at @entity84 before owner @entity85 replaced him with @entity86			1
he had forged his reputation and was spoken of as the " new @entity88 " by leading @entity89 to the @entity55 title and the @entity92 league and cup double in the same season			0
villas - @entity6 becomes the fifth @entity2 manager to lose their job this campaign , following @entity98 ( @entity99 ) , @entity100 ( @entity101 ) and @entity102 ( @entity103 ) , while @entity104 parted company with @entity106 saturday			1
@entity108 manager @entity107 , the former @entity109 head coach , has been installed as an early favorite by @entity112 bookmakers			1
@entity107 's former assistant with @entity109 at @entity114 and @entity49 , @entity115 , is currently @entity3 's director of football			1
@entity3 later announced that former players @entity116 and @entity118 would take charge of first team affairs in the interim , assisted by @entity122 , who is head of player development			2
@entity126 @entity125 side @entity124 also parted company with their coach monday after a poor weekend result , losing 3 - 0 to high - flying @entity130			2
@entity131 was relieved of his duties after only six months as the defeat left them 10 points adrift of @entity136 , who occupy the final @entity14 spot			0
like @entity6 , @entity131 had guided his team into the last 32 of the @entity55 , where they will face @entity141 , but their league form has been indifferent .			0

@entity3 sack manager @entity6
departs after 17 months in charge at @entity2 club
