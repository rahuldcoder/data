at the tender age of five , surviving a tornado a mile wide is , at the least , traumatizing			2
being separated from mom and dad after that , and living in a strange house , is enough to make a little boy break down and cry			2
through the eyes of a dog , possessive of its owner , a stranger in the house screaming at a family member can look like a threat that must be dealt with			1
the two scenarios cruelly collided over the weekend when a 150 - lb bull mastiff fatally mauled a 5 - year - old boy , puncturing his head and neck			1
@entity18 had taken the little boy into her @entity19 , @entity20 , home after he and his family survived a monster tornado that in may waylaid @entity23 , @entity24			1
his parents had returned home , 200 miles away , to gather up the pieces of their lives			2
sunday , something upset the child and he threw a temper tantrum , the country sheriff 's office said			0
@entity18 went over to calm him , but the screaming upset another family member -- @entity18 's dog			1
the dog probably thought the boy was attacking its owner , said @entity40 deputy @entity39			1
@entity18 fought to unlock the dog 's jaws from around the boy while calling to her husband for help , the sheriff 's office said			1
she pried the dog loose , but the damage was done			1
the couple rushed the bleeding boy to meet an ambulance , which took him to the hospital , where he was pronounced dead			2
authorities did not release his name			0
the dog ran away but was later captured			2
no charges have been filed against @entity18 , @entity39 said			1
" i am just really sorry that this happened in @entity40 to people who have undergone such tragedy			0
it makes your heart bleed for them , " @entity40 justice of the peace @entity62 told @entity65 affiliate @entity64			0
she was close to tears			0
as justice of the peace , she has seen too many maulings by dogs			0
she keeps a collection of gruesome photos of people with flesh torn away from their arms , legs and faces by " bully " breeds , as she calls them			0
" i would say just in the last two months we 've had at least seven attacks involving these dogs , " she said			0
her county has some of the most relaxed laws in the state , she said			0
" we do n't even have a simple leash law			0
" she wants that to change			0
