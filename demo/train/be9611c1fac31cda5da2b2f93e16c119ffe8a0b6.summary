-- all the traditional elements were in place for @entity3 and @entity6 's @entity5 wedding			1
she wore a white dress ; he wore a tuxedo and her family wore kilts in honor of her @entity15 heritage			1
after they exchanged vows and rings and sealed the deal with a kiss , an officiant in a black robe pronounced them husband and wife			0
then , they dined and danced the night away at an @entity28 country club with their closest friends and loved ones , culminating in a midnight confetti drop			0
missing from the guest list : @entity33			0
the @entity34 are atheists who did not want gods or religious texts involved in their marriage celebration			1
but apart from the non-church setting , the only hint at an deliberately non-religious wedding was contained within their vows and readings			1
these included selections from @entity47 , @entity48 and the @entity49 ruling on same - sex marriage , which they felt " beautifully expressed the social and secular significance of marriage without any appeal to religion , " said @entity57 , a lawyer in @entity58 , @entity59			1
" we felt it made the point well that you can have the sanctity of marriage without having to fit into a particular group , " he said			0
" it basically states that marriage is extremely important in society for a variety of reasons , regardless of what someone 's god thinks about it			1
" as secularism continues to rise in the @entity76 , more couples like the @entity34 are deviating from a traditional wedding blueprint that includes prayers , blessings and biblical passages			1
" a secular wedding can be exactly like a religious wedding with two key differences : no mention of any deities and no recitation of supposedly sacred texts , " said @entity81 , author of " @entity82 , @entity83 , i 'm an @entity91 : the guide to coming out as a @entity94 and @entity93 and other @entity95			1
" " many secular weddings have vows , flowers , rings , a reception , a kiss at the end , " he continued			1
" although most religions have incorporated marriage rules and ceremonies into their faiths , the act of marriage itself is not a religious one ; it 's a human one			1
" venues , readings and vows are just some considerations for atheist couples or couples planning secular weddings			1
others struggle with how to break the news to relatives or meet their demands , especially if those loved ones are helping pay for it			0
some couples provide relatives with opportunities to say a few words within set parameters during the ceremony or reception , said @entity132 , former president of @entity133 and current chair of the @entity135			1
he has performed several atheist weddings over the past decade and emphasizes that it 's important to talk about it ahead of time , openly and honestly			1
" you need to stop and think about what you want to accomplish			0
are you trying to publicly commit to a lifelong union with your partner on your terms , or do you want to please others ? " he said			0
" i would argue that if you do n't believe in @entity33 and have @entity33 blessing the celebration , you 're participating in a sham			0
but , there are ways to to acknowledge @entity33 for others , if that 's what you want , " @entity148 advised			1
give fair warning buying a home was more important to @entity156 and her fiance than spending big bucks on a wedding			1
instead , they went to a justice of the peace in september " for the official stuff " and held a " picnic wedding " in their backyard later in the day			1
her mother paid for catering while more local guests brought side dishes			0
" we wanted to get married , but we 're not really comfortable with doing it in a church and all that stuff , " @entity156 said			0
" we 're introverts , so we did n't want a big wedding			1
just a few friends and family			2
this way , we had a wedding and a housewarming party			2
" they wanted to keep it simple and inexpensive for everyone			0
rank comes from a family of believers , so she felt like she needed to warn them on the wedding invitation with a message to the effect of : " this is a small , nontraditional secular service			1
if you 're comfortable with that , we 'd love to have you			2
" most relatives ended up coming , though no one who did n't show up explicitly cited the secular event as the reason			1
" we wanted to put it out there so no one would book a flight and fly 3,000 miles expecting a pastor and a ceremony			0
" it worked out for the guests as well ; several of her mother 's religious friends said they enjoyed the wedding it because it was " short and sweet			1
" @entity156 's sister and brother - in - law did a reading from @entity215 before the couple exchanged rings and planted a tree -- their twist on a unity candle			2
" no one said anything or seemed to or care that it was secular or atheist wedding , " said @entity156 , who lives outside @entity222 , @entity223			1
" it was a perfect day			0
" elope now , wedding later @entity230 and @entity231 are proud atheists who met on the dating site ok @entity234			2
both come from deeply religious families			2
as the son of a nondenominational @entity240 pastor , @entity237 grew up going on mission trips and attending church camp			0
at 16 , he stopped going to church and became the black sheep of the family			2
in his 20s , he started identifying as atheist , meaning he does n't believe in " anything supernatural : @entity33 , the afterlife , ghosts , spirits , supernatural souls , anything like that			2
" when he came out to his parents , they tried to convince him to return to @entity93 for a period of time			0
eventually , his father acknowledged that there was nothing he could say or do and decided it was up to @entity33 to change his son 's mind			2
he would always love and support his son			2
still , after @entity230 proposed to @entity231 in february , it was hard to tell his father that he did n't want him to perform the wedding			2
" i tried to frame it in a positive light ; i told him i wanted him to enjoy it without having to work it , " said @entity237 , a high school @entity269 teacher			0
" but we 're pretty passionate about our beliefs , and we want to have a secular service with no mention of @entity33 , @entity278 , eternity or blessings			2
" growing up in @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity231 and her family were pretty much the only people of color , so religion was a way for her to fit in , make friends and be part of a community			2
in college , she was exposed to a broad swath of faiths , ethnicities and sexual orientations			0
@entity231 began to question her own beliefs and came to realize that atheism felt right for her			0
her family still struggles with this decision ; her mother periodically laments that she wo n't see her daughter in the afterlife , and her grandparents say they are praying for her			0
she keeps discussion of religion to a minimum			0
their attitude toward religion contributed in part to the couple 's decision to elope in august , about a year before they 'd originally planned to have a wedding			1
everyone knew the couple had gotten engaged in february , but when @entity231 lost her job , they decided to get legally married without the celebration			0
" we basically decided that it would be easier to tell everyone after the fact , " @entity237 said			0
the @entity325 made it official and then brought a wedding photographer to @entity330 's @entity329 amphitheater , the site of their first date in 2011			1
they still plan on throwing a book - themed wedding in july 2014 to celebrate their relationship and their shared passion			0
@entity231 , a librarian , is working on bouquets and centerpieces of book pages , and the save - the - dates are made from old library due date cards			0
the @entity325 have n't decided on readings , but they 're leaning toward some of their favorite texts related to love and romance			1
@entity230 's looking at something from " @entity351 " or " @entity352			0
" for @entity231 , it might be @entity354			0
" what has bothered me about some weddings is , the focus becomes @entity33 and religion when it should be about the two of you and your and relationship , " @entity231 said			0
" i like that our wedding is going to be focused on us and our love			1
" is it important to you that a wedding have religious elements ? please share in the comments below .			1

@entity3 and @entity6 deliberately *excluded* religious texts from their wedding
experts say it 's important to let religious family *members* know that the event will be secular
couples need to prepare for the *possibility* that not everyone will *approve*
" i like that our wedding is going to be focused on us and our love , " said one atheist bride
