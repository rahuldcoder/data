editor 's note : look for the @entity3 special issue , on newsstands now , and download the digital edition from the @entity5			2
it 's loaded with hundreds of ideas from the silly to the spooky ( and every mood in between )			1
( @entity10 ) -- i love getting dressed up in fantastical costumes for @entity13 — and luckily for me , most years i get to do it not once but twice			1
in addition to whatever i wear on october 31 , i also undergo a complete transformation for our @entity13 special issue ( on newsstands now )			1
in order to have this edition available in time for the holiday , we create costumes , carve pumpkins , bake treats , and make all manner of scary and unusual and bewitching decorations months in advance			1
@entity10 : 15 kitchen shortcuts that will change the way you cook i thought you might like to go " behind the scenes " to find out a little about how we dream up these costumes			1
the notion of a " @entity36 " first came about in march , when our special - projects group was planning the @entity13 issue			1
i met with crafts director @entity39 and told her that , this year , i wanted my costume to be something sweet and nice			1
( some years i want it to be dark and mysterious			1
) the editors had already been planning a story inspired by classic fairy tales , so a fairygodmother character came to us naturally			2
i suggested a costume made of tulle , because it is so readily available and economical yet lends itself to beautiful and ethereal effects			1
@entity39 began sketching ideas for a " low - sew " gown , requiring little stitching , and we discussed all the details : whether it should have a hood or a collar ( we went with a dramatic collar ) , how my makeup should look ( very sparkly ) , and how to wear my hair ( up , with ringlets and tendrils )			1
@entity10 : 19 tips for perfect laundry every time on the day of the photo shoot , in june , i was very pleased to see the wooded wonderland the team had created in our studio — complete with moss and tree stumps from my farm			2
it took two and a half hours for me to get into full costume ; i took a break about halfway through and walked the halls of our offices and test kitchens with my @entity36 makeup on and my hair in curlers			1
( funnily enough , colleagues were not too surprised to see me that way ! ) @entity10 : instant organization : get it together in 15 minutes or less after all that , the photographs , shot by the very talented @entity91 , took 25 minutes			2
i hope you try this costume — or maybe the @entity95 or the @entity96 or the @entity97 in the special issue is more your style , or perhaps your kids would like to be elves or sprites — and enjoy the process of transformation as much as i did			1
