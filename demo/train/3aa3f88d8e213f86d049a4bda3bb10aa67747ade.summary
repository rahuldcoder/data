-- inside the city limits of @entity4 , mounds of churned up earth are piled knee high as far as the eye can see			0
fresh green grass has disappeared and the only evidence of any shrubs is the exposed roots protruding from the carnage			0
what looks to be the path of a devastating tornado in @entity16 's heartland is actually the result of a small group of feral hogs in the lone star state			1
@entity23 , along with many of the southern states , is facing a problem of " @entity26 " proportions			1
from agricultural fields and farmland to golf courses and playgrounds , no property is off limits to these chubby eating machines			1
from 2 to 6 million feral hogs are wreaking havoc in at least 39 states			1
@entity23 is said to be home to over half of the country 's feral hog population			1
recently , i co-hosted a special series on invasive species featuring the devastating impact feral hogs are having on the residents and livestock of @entity23			1
this " pig explosion " is affecting anyone who drives a car or drinks tap water			1
in other words -- everyone			0
the term , " feral hogs , " refer to either domesticated hogs that are now wild or @entity57 boars , or the hybrid of the two			1
hogs have roamed the @entity16 since the 1530s and were an important source of food for the early pioneers			1
it was n't until the 1930s when the @entity68 wild boar was released into the @entity23 landscape that things began brewing for the perfect pig storm			0
given their ability to adapt well to most environments and their breeding capabilities , a pair of hogs can quickly become hundreds			1
sows can become pregnant at 6 to 8 months old and are capable of birthing four to six piglets per litter			1
in @entity23 alone the agricultural damage caused by hogs is estimated to be $ 52 million dollars annually			1
with millions of hog snouts rooting their way through the @entity86 , the problem has grown from an agricultural and rural issue to a suburban nightmare			1
as witnessed recently in the @entity91 suburbs , a torn up yard or demolished sprinkler system is a common occurrence			0
imagine driving your car into a 500 - pound black boar or worse ... a group of them			0
hundreds of pig - vehicle collisions occur every year			0
in some cases , severe injury and death happen			0
along with costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in land , property and collision damage , another scary reality is the effect on water quality			1
because hogs do n't have any sweat glands they often wallow in creeks and rivers beds to keep cool			1
@entity116 in and around these water sources produce high levels of bacteria			2
this same contaminated water is often used to irrigate agricultural fields that are growing your family 's vegetables			2
some reports estimate the total damage feral hogs cause annually in the @entity16 to be over $ 1 billion			1
whether we 're talking millions or billions , the big question looms in everyone 's mind : what can we do about it ? is an " @entity134 " inevitable ? the first and most important step is to acknowledge and understand the problem at hand			2
the @entity138 has made efforts to spotlight the problem both at the state and federal levels			2
with many shows highlighting hog hunting , even on prime time tv , the issue has been brought to the attention of the general public			0
that poses another question : whose problem is it ? often people do n't care about problems that are n't occurring in their own backyard			2
while there 's no easy solution , there are ways of helping manage their numbers			0
being a lifelong big game hunter , i fully support any legal method of helping lower the population of feral hogs			1
hunting and trapping are two of the best solutions			0
i 've hunted wild hogs in the swamplands of @entity172			2
i 've even hunted hogs in @entity23 at night			2
the only problem i see in hunting hogs is there are not enough hunters			1
pigs are smart and typically more active at night			0
hunting pigs is not as easy as one might think			0
and while hunting and trapping these destructive creatures can be very successful , hunters and trappers simply ca n't keep up with the population			2
now the thought probably crossed your mind : how about we eat them ? sure , these pigs will never win any beauty pageant but they are wonderful table fare			0
butchered into bacon strips and pork chops or barbecued on the spit , they are simply delicious			0
in my opinion , wild hog meat is just as tasty as common , domesticated pig			0
in fact , trapped hogs in @entity23 are often sold to independent buyers who sell these swines overseas to @entity205 markets			2
but in order to get them to the dining table we still need to knock them down first			0
personally , i have witnessed the devastation on several visits to @entity23 while interviewing ranchers and wildlife officials			0
the severity of the situation hit home after i met a woman who demolished her pickup truck after it collided with a 300 - pound boar			0
the southern states are the ones most affected by the wild hogs but that wo n't be the case for long as their population grows			1
it 's obvious this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed			2
in the theatrical release of this summer 's blockbuster hit " @entity235 " @entity230 figured out how to save humanity from a virus			0
@entity23 could be in a world of hurt because of their pig population if they do n't prepare for " @entity241 " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			1

@entity244 : many southern states are facing a problem of " @entity26 ' " proportions
@entity250 : estimate says two to 8 million feral hogs are wreaking havoc in 39 states
she says the hogs cause costly damages to property , agriculture and water supply
@entity250 : i fully support any legal method of lowering the population of feral hogs
