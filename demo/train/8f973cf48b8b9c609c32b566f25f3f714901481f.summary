around 2 p.m. , @entity82 started it			2
they started pumping 50,000 pounds of a special mud - like fluid that has about twice the density of water and they were pumping that into the leak			1
they hope -- we all hope -- it stops the oil			0
then , the whole thing will be sealed off with cement			0
the head of @entity82 said there was about a 60 to 70 percent chance of success			0
president @entity26 said if it works , it should seriously reduce or even stop the flow of oil			0
if it fails , the president says they 'll move onto the next strategy			0
when we recorded this show yesterday , the process was still going on			0
we hope to have more details on it for you tomorrow			0

@entity119 , @entity30 secretary of state : let me repeat publicly what i expressed privately to president @entity141 and minister @entity142			1
the @entity30 offers our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the 46 sailors killed in the sinking of the @entity149 and to all the people of @entity6			1
we will stand with you in this difficult hour and we stand with you always			0
@entity152 @entity153 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to miss @entity156 's civics and economics class at @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160 ! what is the term for a group of military ships ? you know what to do ! is it : @entity168 or @entity169 ) conclave ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! a group of military ships is referred to as a fleet			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity177 @entity25 : and a celebration involving a group of military ships is called @entity177 ! it 's taking place right now in @entity7			1
@entity177 is actually a celebration of all the military sea services : the @entity185 , the @entity186 and the @entity187			1
they happen in different cities all over the country			0
@entity7 has hosted a @entity177 nearly every year since 1984			1
thousands of sailors , @entity186 and @entity187 members are in @entity7 for the event			1
it kicks off with the @entity194 , which you see right here			0
once they dock at the pier , people can go on board and take tours of the @entity185 vessels			0
plus , there are dozens of military demonstrations throughout the week			1
@entity203 @entity25 : @entity177 runs through @entity204 this weekend			1
of course , @entity204 , the holiday , pays tribute to all @entity30 troops who have lost their lives while serving the country in battle			1
@entity0 has a new website that does the same kind of thing			0
it 's called " @entity203			1
" you see it on your screen right here			0
it 's focused on the wars in @entity217 and @entity218			1
more than 6,000 @entity30 and coalition troops have been killed in these conflicts			1
the " @entity203 " site connects where these men and women died with where they lived , and it gives family members and friends an opportunity to share memories about their loved ones			0
you 'll find a link to the site in the @entity235 section of our home page ; that 's @entity130			2
is this legit ? @entity238 , @entity15 : is this legit ? the space shuttle @entity239 is named after the legendary lost city			2
nope ! the shuttle is named after a sailing ship that was run by an oceanographic institute			0
last landing for @entity239 ? @entity25 : @entity239 came in for what could be its final landing yesterday			0
the space shuttle program is scheduled to end later on this year , and @entity239 is the first shuttle on the retirement list			1
it touched down at @entity250 after its 32nd mission			0
during that time , it helped with the international space station and launched spacecraft that explored @entity255 and @entity256			2
@entity239 ' service in space is n't necessarily over though			2
it 's the back - up shuttle for a future mission if anything goes wrong , so @entity262 's getting the shuttle ready just in case			1
once the shuttles do retire , they 're not headed for the junk yard , and you ca n't really recycle them			2
@entity270 thought looks at what could happen once the space shuttles are permanently grounded			1
( begin video ) @entity270 , @entity0 correspondent : as they rocket to space , the astronauts watch the world fall away below them			2
three , two , one , mark			0
@entity282 : @entity283 does a somersault as it approaches the space station			2
nearly 30 years of these " oh wow " moments almost over			0
the end of this year or sometime next , the last shuttle will fly			0
so , what do you do with three old orbiters ? @entity292 , @entity239 has got 120 million miles on her			0
if you 're @entity262 , you ca n't get all teary - eyed and nostalgic			1
you 've got to unload those old clunkers and move on ; put a for - sale sign on @entity239 and @entity283 and @entity296			2
so , you 've got to build a building right here that would enclose the space shuttle for a bit			2
it 's got to be a temperature - controlled building , right ? @entity303 , @entity250 , visitor complex : has to be all up to artifact standards			1
but more than just the building for the shuttle , we have to tell the story			0
@entity282 : @entity310 heads the privately - run @entity311 at the @entity250			2
they are one of at least a dozen suitors ready , in fact eager , to fork over to @entity262 $ 28.8 million for an orbiter			1
@entity316 , @entity262 spokesman : we 're not selling them , remember			1
this is what it 's going to cost to get it cleaned up and make it safe to display and then to actually get it there			2
@entity282 : you 've got almost $ 30 million ready to hand that check to @entity262			1
@entity329 : between our cash and the loan arrangements , we could take the shuttle tomorrow and get ready to go			0
@entity282 : there is no real rush , space agency officials say , to announce who gets which one because the orbiters are still flying			2
@entity262 has offered @entity283 , the oldest in the fleet , to the @entity341			1
museum officials there told us questions about cost " have not been resolved , although the museum is exploring options			0
" one orbiter option is the @entity349			0
folks at the @entity351 say more people would see it here than anywhere else			0
they estimate a 30 percent increase in attendance			2
@entity357 , @entity351 : we figure over 300,000 people additional to the @entity351 to @entity7			1
couple that with the $ 106 million in economic benefits , we think that 's a pretty good deal			2
@entity282 : landing one of history 's first space planes would certainly qualify as a pretty good deal			1
@entity270 , @entity0 , at the @entity250 in @entity367			0
( @entity368 ) before we go @entity25 : before we go , why did n't the duck cross the road ? ' cause it was chicken ! you would be too if you were trying to make it across rush hour traffic			0
luckily -- do n't be afraid -- someone spotted the junior jaywalkers and called the cops			0
the officers arrived , stopped traffic and escorted the fearful fowl across the highway			0
youi see that taking place right here			0
but it does raise a question though			0
when police officers are called in to help ducks ... goodbye @entity25 : who gets stuck with the bill ? if that one did n't get you to quack up , we 'll try again tomorrow			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity19 .			0
