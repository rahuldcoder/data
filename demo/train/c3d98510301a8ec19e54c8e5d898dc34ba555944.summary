-- compare and contrast the economic plan @entity2 released in september with the speech he delivered friday in @entity4			1
the plan was published as a downloadable e-book , introduced by a former chair of the president 's @entity8 , @entity11 business school dean @entity10			1
it was the product of heavy research and careful thought			0
the plan rejected further early tax cuts for high - income individuals , saying instead : " we need taxes to pay for the operations of government			1
but they should be collected by a system that is simple and fair , and that causes the least possible disruption to the productive economy			0
" while the entire tax code is in dire need of a fundamental overhaul , @entity2 believes in holding the line against increases in marginal tax rates			1
the goals that president @entity34 pursued in bringing rates down to their current level -- to spur economic growth , encourage savings and investment , and help struggling @entity40 make ends meet -- are just as important today as they were a decade ago			1
letting them lapse , as president @entity43 promises to do in 2012 , is a step in precisely the wrong direction			2
if anything , the lower rates established by president @entity34 should be regarded as a directional marker on the road to more fundamental reform			2
) by contrast , the @entity4 speech seems to have been written on the back of an envelope			2
the only thought that went into it was : how do we rev up the base so that we can win the next primaries ? @entity2 said : " first , i will make an across - the - board , 20 % reduction in marginal individual income tax rates [ tax brackets ]			1
by reducing the tax on the next dollar of income earned by all taxpayers , we will encourage hard work , risk - taking , and productivity by allowing @entity40 to keep more of what they earn			2
" the businesses that pay taxes through the individual income tax system account for more than half of all private sector jobs in the @entity40			0
so this tax cut will encourage businesses to hire , raise wages , and grow the economy			2
" no effort is made to corroborate these claims for the economic benefits of a further 20 % tax cut			2
corroboration is not needed in a speech intended narrowly for the pre-convinced			0
but wait -- wo n't such a big tax cut , piled atop the previous commitment to renew the @entity34 tax cuts when they expire in 2013 , greatly add to the deficit ? especially when joined to new promises to permanently abolish the @entity94 and estate tax ? how will the federal budget be balanced ? not with cuts to current @entity100 beneficiaries , the speech hastens to assure			1
" tax hikes are off the table , and there will be no change for those at or near retirement			0
" @entity100 and @entity108 reform will not begin until 2022			1
yet the tax cuts are supposed to go into effect right away			1
how to close the gap ? growth , of course , will help			0
but mostly , the speech suggests that the gap will be closed with big cuts to programs for the poor , such as " food stamps , housing subsidies , and job training			2
" what about the social costs of imposing such big cuts on a population that has by no means recovered from the economic catastrophe of 2008 - 2009 ? do the numbers even add up ? one might cynically answer : who cares ? the speech is not intended as policy			1
it 's intended to corral @entity135 primary voters			0
if @entity2 wins the election in november , that will be the time to think seriously about economic plans			1
yet cynicism is not always as sophisticated as it thinks it is			0
however short - term the motivations behind it , @entity2 's speech in @entity141 will have heavy consequences for at least four reasons : even if the speech does not strictly qualify as a flip - flop , it does continue the pattern of @entity2 yielding under pressure from the @entity135 base			1
winning candidates look for ways to demonstrate independence from party dogma			0
in 2008 , @entity43 did it by praising @entity157 and preaching the importance of fathers			0
@entity34 did it with his october 1999 speech repudiating claims that the @entity40 was " slouching toward @entity163			0
" @entity165 of course had his @entity167 speech			0
@entity2 instead is following the @entity169 approach of knuckling his forehead to every interest group in the party			2
each succeeding act of submission makes him look weaker			0
@entity2 has now wholly identified himself as the candidate of the rich and the old			2
nothing is to be asked from those over 55			0
much is to be given to upper - income earners			0
all the burden of fiscal adjustment is to be piled on the poor and the young			0
when republicans invoke the memory of @entity157 , they ought to remember how powerfully @entity157 spoke to the aspirations of young @entity40 -- and how the support of young @entity40 in turn made the oldest of @entity40 presidents appear exciting to voters in every age group			0
today 's @entity135 party goes out of its way to show contempt and hostility to the young -- an attitude that will have consequences for a long time to come			2
it 's not impossible that @entity2 may win this election			1
if he does , he 'll find that his speech in @entity4 surrendered the initiative for his first year in office to the republicans in the @entity204			0
they will want to pass the tax cut first			0
@entity2 has now endorsed it , so how can he say no ? they will want to do some version of the @entity211 budget next			1
and whoosh , there goes his first year -- and all the priorities that his september plan and his own book suggested he regards as more important : tax reform , trade , etc. anti-tax crusader @entity215 will be proved right : @entity2 will have reduced himself to a signing machine for a government whose real power is centered in @entity224			1
if @entity100 , @entity108 and defense are off the table -- and if the rest of the government is not to be obliterated entirely -- then hopes of deficit reduction after @entity2 's big tax cut will rest on the country zooming to @entity233 levels of economic growth			1
what if that growth does not appear ? it 's one thing to incur dreadful deficits during the worst economic collapse since the @entity240			1
the @entity2 plan threatens to institutionalize those deficits even during the period of recovery ahead			1
compassionate conservatism has been dead for a long time			0
@entity2 's @entity4 speech cremated the remains			1
as a man , @entity2 remains far and away the most capable of the presidential candidates seeking the @entity135 nomination			2
but he has now finally eliminated the policy differences separating him from the radical congressional wing			0
if @entity2 should win the @entity135 nomination , moderate and independent voters nationwide will be forced to decide : if they vote for @entity2 , who is it they 're truly voting for ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			1

@entity259 : @entity2 's friday speech flies in face of his economic plan
@entity2 's promise of more tax cuts could tie his hands if he is elected president
@entity270 : if @entity100 , @entity108 changes ruled out until 2022 , budget deficits will grow
he says @entity2 's new idea will hurt the young and those hit hard by the *recession*
