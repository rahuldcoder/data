in a @entity54 , @entity48 described what it 's like			2
" there 's a lot of physiological changes that happen , " he said			2
" the main thing which is n't experienced in any other sport is what 's called the ' blood shift , ' which is where all the blood is squeezed in from your extremities , and at the same time your lungs are becoming crushed by the weight of the water column above you			2
so you get blood pooling in the lungs			2
" " it 's a mental sport as much as it is a physical one			2
one of the beautiful aspects of it is that it forces you to be in the moment			0
