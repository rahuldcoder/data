-- people upset at @entity3 's acquittal are calling for awarding various new powers to prosecutors at the expense of protections for criminal defendants			1
maybe this would make it easier to hang a rap on some future @entity3			2
but it also would have an effect that its backers probably do n't intend : increasing the number of persons convicted and sent to prison			2
as part of that effect , more young black men -- as well as more members of other groups -- will end up behind bars			1
on @entity26 and @entity27 , many people have expressed frustration with the conviction standard of " beyond a reasonable doubt , " which the state of @entity24 was unable to overcome			0
could n't we lower it ? others hoped prosecutors could appeal the verdict ( right now , they ca n't ; an acquittal is final )			1
to change either of these basic features of our judicial system , we 'd have to overturn the @entity40 's settled view of the @entity41 or amend the @entity42 itself			2
and what would happen if we did ? convictions would rise , and the nation 's outlandishly large and disproportionately black prison rolls would swell yet further			2
or consider the popular notion of retrying @entity3 on federal charges			2
under our @entity42 , even serious crimes such as murder are traditionally offenses under state law only			0
in a controversial 1959 opinion , @entity54 v. @entity55 , the @entity40 ruled that consecutive prosecutions under state and federal law do not violate the @entity42 's ban on double jeopardy			0
interestingly , that was the view of the court 's five more conservative justices			0
the dissenters , who warned eloquently of the dangers of letting government try people twice for the same conduct , were the four liberals : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			0
for many years thereafter , such prosecutions were a rare exception			0
occasionally they were of national note , as when a @entity79 authority would refuse to prosecute a white - on - black crime			0
only with the @entity83 case in @entity84 in 1993 did anyone seriously propose giving prosecutors a second bite at the apple after a state prosecution pursued in good faith before an ordinary jury ended in an unpopular acquittal			1
if the floodgates now open , how long before we see federal enforcers begin to second - guess state - court acquittals in , say , drug cases ? others call for narrowing self - defense rights , though the @entity3 case wound up being tried under pretty much the same self - defense standard that prevails in the great majority of states			1
@entity24 's so - called " stand your ground " law , which did away with the " duty to retreat , " was ignored by both prosecution and defense , and the jury appeared to accept @entity3 's contention that retreat was not an option for him once the altercation began			1
a key constituency seeking to roll back stand your ground in the @entity24 legislature is prosecutors , whose interests just might not be fully congruent with those of the people they prosecute			0
although critics insist that stand your ground leads to racially disparate effects , the @entity122 , a paper that has been highly critical of the law , concedes its in - depth investigation " found no obvious bias in how black defendants have been treated " under the law			0
it also quoted @entity132 , a black @entity133 lawyer " whose clients are mostly black men , " as saying it had sometimes worked to the advantage of her clients facing charges over altercations			1
" let 's be clear , " @entity132 told the paper , " this law was not designed for the protection of young black males , but it 's benefiting them in certain cases			0
" if you 're looking for things that really went wrong in the @entity3 case and are part of wider patterns unfavorable toward minorities , try looking at the prosecution 's misdeeds			1
in particular , @entity24 state attorney @entity156 overcharged , going for second - degree murder when even manslaughter was shaky			0
that did n't cow @entity3 , who had a sizable legal defense fund , but such tactics work every day in extracting plea - bargain surrenders from ordinary - @entity164 defendants who fear a worse verdict			1
@entity167 's team also tried the case in the news media , made jury - inflaming assertions it could n't back up with proof , and ( according to a whistle - blowing employee , soon fired by @entity167 ) even withheld evidence from the defense side , an ethical breach should it be proven			2
a public stirred up to outrage over sins like those might come to realize that they 're not a fluke of the @entity3 case , but crop up regularly in the everyday criminal justice system , to the disfavor of minority ( and nonminority ) defendants			1
when the emotional grip of the moment has relaxed , we may wonder how we ever imagined that the way to help minorities in the justice system was to take away criminal defendants ' rights			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0

@entity196 : those upset with verdict call for giving new powers to prosecutors
@entity202 : the *unintended* effect of this would be that more black men would end up in prisons
he says what really went wrong in the @entity3 case is the prosecution 's misdeeds
@entity202 : to help minorities in the justice system , do n't look to taking away defendants ' rights
