as a mother , i would understand completely if @entity2 , a mother from @entity3 , @entity4 , never wanted to get out of bed in the morning			1
if she did n't want to stop crying			2
if she could n't muster up the energy to do anything			0
those would be expected responses to what she is coping with -- the " unimaginable " is one word she uses to describe it -- but instead she 's on a mission			1
" i guess what motivates me is @entity16 and what he would want me to do , " she said			1
@entity16 was the name of her 15 - month - old son			1
on july 7 , @entity21 - @entity2 's husband , @entity20 , was supposed to drop @entity16 off at day care			1
the drop - off never occurred			0
her husband drove to work and at the end of the day went to day care to pick @entity16 up , she said during an interview			1
when @entity16 was n't there , he asked the day care providers if his wife had picked him up earlier			1
when they told him no , he went to the car , found @entity16 and rushed him to the hospital , she said			1
their little boy had died			1
forty - four children died of heat stroke in cars in 2013 , and more than 500 have died in hot cars since 2000 , according to the child advocacy group @entity42			1
the investigation into @entity45 's death is still ongoing , according to the @entity3 police and prosecutor			1
last month , the @entity4 medical examiner determined the cause of death was hyperthermia because of environmental exposure and ruled the death a homicide			0
@entity56 legal analyst @entity55 said the use of the word " homicide " in the autopsy report does not necessarily mean that criminal charges will be filed in the case			0
" in legal parlance , the term means that death was caused by another human being rather than by strictly natural causes , " said @entity55			0
@entity68 has said she wo n't comment further on what happened that day , citing the ongoing investigation , but decided to go public to bring attention to @entity74 , thursday , july 31			1
" right now there 's a hole and it 's like a missing space where he used to be , " she said			1
" and so i kind of feel like since he 's not here , a way that i can have that happiness again is to continue to live through him with what i think he would want me to do for other people and for ourselves , because this is healing for us , too			2
" just three weeks after her son 's death , @entity21 - @entity2 , who also has two daughters , ages 5 and 8 , has created a blog called " @entity96 , " which she is using to bring attention to the number of children who die of heatstroke in cars and to press for action to save lives			1
we need to do more , she says , beyond public awareness campaigns			2
" i just feel like public awareness has been around for years , and honestly i never paid any attention to it			2
i mean , we 're the all - american family , and we never in our lives understood how this happens			0
" she and her husband never understood how someone could actually forget their child was in the back seat of a car , much less that they themselves could do it , she said			0
" i 've gone back in my head over and over a million times of that day , of what if ? " she said			2
what if she had contacted her husband and asked about drop - off ? what if she had done @entity128 ? @entity68 started reading anything she could get her hands on about child heatstroke in cars			2
she talked to nonprofit advocacy groups such as @entity42 , read what experts such as @entity135 , a psychology professor at the @entity136 , have written about a phenomenon known as @entity139 , and studied the legislative stops and starts to try and save lives			0
" and then i just started thinking , ' wait a minute			0
you mean this has been around for over 10 years , ' " she said , referring to the problem of children dying in hot cars			1
she then learned about failed attempts to include a provision in previous legislation back in 2007 , which would require that cars include some way to remind drivers about passengers in the back when the car is turned off and the driver leaves the vehicle			2
she wondered why there is n't a law like that on the books now			0
@entity68 , who 's a lawyer , talked with her husband about making their family 's new mission the push for action against child vehicular heat stroke			2
opinion : i , too , left my child in a hot car " he 's an engineer , so we would sit together and he has his notepad , and he 's like drawing out ideas for devices of things that could be developed , and i 'm sitting here looking at the legal stuff			1
and we just kind of came together and said , you know , together as a family we 'd like to do this , " she said			0
she has since even drafted a bill , which she calls @entity45 's @entity184 , and is using it as she reaches out to @entity186 senators and representatives about options to consider			1
( she has so far talked with one @entity186 senator and @entity191 and @entity192 staffers			0
) her bill includes ideas such as having the @entity195 convene roundtable discussions with everyone from the automobile and car seat industries , to child safety advocates and victims , to academic and medical professionals			0
she also wants to see more funding for research and development for technology that would detect a child in the rear seat when the driver leaves the car			1
she 's backing a petition drive by @entity42 to urge the @entity192 to authorize the @entity195 to provide funding for that research and development			1
( the group , which has more than 7,500 signatures , needed 100,000 by august 13			2
) the @entity218 reviewed the technology that was available in 2012 , which included sensors that would detect the weight of a toddler in a car seat or restraint , when the ignition is off and a driver leaves the vehicle , and activate an alarm or alert			2
the agency determined sensors and other technology available at the time were not reliable enough			2
the technology " just does n't seem to be there yet , " @entity234 , the agency 's acting administrator , told me in an interview in july			1
" ' yet ' is an important word there , " he added			0
@entity68 believes the ideal technology would be devices such as sensors that detect the presence of the child in the car seat when the driver leaves the car , which she says should be installed in cars and car seats before you buy them -- not as voluntary accessories			1
she admits she probably would n't have purchased such a device , again because she never expected her family to experience this type of tragedy			0
but had there been technology already in her car or on their son 's car seat before both were purchased , @entity21 - @entity2 said , @entity45 would be with her today			1
" absolutely -- it would have saved his life			0
" @entity68 looks forward to a time , which she hopes will be soon , when the police investigation is wrapped up , and her husband is free of any possible charges and can speak out freely			0
" he wants to tell the public how this happens so that people can think about it and be aware of it , and show why we need devices out there to help people			0
because if you describe the mental state of how it happens to people very eloquently and clearly , it 's easier , i think , for them to understand			2
" it is still something that is " beyond words , " she said , referring to the moment she saw her husband in the emergency room on that dreadful night			0
" i 've never witnessed anything like that before			2
nobody should ever witness that			0
" the family is trying to tune out the critics and harsh comments , including calls by some for @entity300 to be charged , and is gaining strength from the support of family , friends and their daughters			0
@entity68 remembers how her youngest girl , whom she calls her " sidekick , " comforted her with wise words in the days after @entity16 's death : " you know , we ca n't change what happened , but we can just move forward and live , " she said			1
as for @entity16 , she describes him as " the happiest human being " she ever met , a boy who smiled and laughed every day and with his entire face , a boy people used to say was " too pretty " to be a boy			1
the day before @entity16 was buried , @entity21 - @entity2 knew she was not ready to say goodbye			1
she wanted to find something permanent that she could carry with her -- a way to " have him with me , " she said as she started to tear up			0
she headed to the mall and found a locket			0
she wears the half inscribed " son " around her neck , and @entity16 has the other half , inscribed " @entity328			1
" " i realized that his heart is in my heart ... and that i always wanted to keep it with me , " she said holding back tears			0
" then i said i want him to have part of me too			0
" and now , she plans to keep his memory alive by helping others			0
" he taught me , during the 15 months that he was here , the value of life and the potential that there is in life to do things meaningful			0

@entity45 is one of at least 19 children who 've died in hot cars in 2014
his mother is now trying to raise awareness and prevent more deaths
