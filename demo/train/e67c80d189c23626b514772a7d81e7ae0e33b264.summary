@entity0 , @entity1 -- as a teenager , @entity3 carried an @entity1 driver 's license with the words " sex offender " stamped in red below his picture			1
his crime ? having sex with a 13 - year - old girl when he was 16			1
the offense occurred when he lived in @entity18 , and the label followed him to @entity1			1
as a @entity21 offender on @entity1 's sex offender registry , @entity3 could not attend high school , visit the town library , or go to his younger brother 's football games			1
but the label did more than limit where @entity3 could go			1
it transformed him from an outgoing , sociable jock into an introvert who has trouble trusting people , his mother says			2
" he 's not the same , " said @entity35 , a straight - talker who has become a full - time activist to reform sex offender legislation since her son 's conviction			1
" i used to get a kick out of @entity41 , " she added			0
" he was so fun - loving and just full of life			0
i mean , there 's no other word			2
@entity45 was full of life and now he 's definitely more cautious , more reserved			2
" now 20 , @entity3 tenses up when he sees children at a supermarket and avoids talking to girls his age , even if they initiate contact , his mother says			1
" i got a lot more fear in me , i mean , because anything could happen , " @entity3 said			1
" say you 're on the registry , and you 're in the mall and a kid comes up missing			2
well , guess what ? you 're the first person they 're going to because you 're on the sex offender registry			1
" @entity3 lived with the " sex offender " label for nearly four years , until a law that took effect in @entity1 in november removed his name from the registry			1
his soft - spoken , reserved manner belies @entity3 's hulking physical presence -- a reminder of his days as a high school athlete			1
on a sunny afternoon in december , he met a @entity2 reporter in the parking lot of the @entity74 , arm - in - arm with his mother , who is blind			2
as he told his story , @entity3 cast furtive glances at each passing car and sized up every person entering the library as if to ensure no one was after him			1
it was his first time at the library since 2006 , when he moved back to his hometown			2
though free of the scarlet letter that changed his life , he still feels the stigma of one of the country 's most reviled labels			2
it was all but impossible to independently verify details of @entity3 's case			1
prosecutors did not return repeated phone calls for comment , and efforts to check court files with @entity18 's @entity100 were also unsuccessful because @entity3 's record has been expunged			1
but @entity3 tells it this way : it all began when he met a girl at a teen club in @entity107			1
they hit it off and started dating			0
he was 16 and thought she was 15			1
when the girl ran away from home , police came looking for @entity3 , who says he admitted to having sex with her twice			1
that 's when police told him she was really 13 , he says			1
two weeks later , police returned to his home and arrested him			0
@entity3 pleaded guilty to one count of sexual abuse for having sex with the 13 - year - old			1
the age of consent in @entity18 is 14			1
taking into account the circumstances of the case , an @entity18 judge accepted @entity3 's plea and ordered that his record be expunged if he successfully completed probation and sex offender treatment			1
at that time , his name would be removed from @entity18 's sex offender registry			1
after his conviction , @entity3 's family moved to @entity1 to get a fresh start			1
he finished his probation and sex offender treatment , and his record in @entity18 was expunged in october 2008 , according to court documents			1
but the action did not carry over to @entity1 , where @entity3 continued to be listed on that state 's sex offender registry			1
the stigma followed him to his new home and the harassment continued , the family said			0
a neighbor who found out he was on the registry videotaped him when he went outside , @entity3 said			1
his picture and address were posted on a vigilante web site , and a gas station attendant refused to sell him cigarettes , one time taking his license and throwing it across the store			0
to comply with state residency restrictions that prevent registered sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a school or day care center , the family moved onto a small plot of land in the rural southeastern @entity1 community of @entity0 , population 3,500			1
the back door of the single - wide trailer faces the forest , a fact that @entity3 's mother finds comforting should her sons ever need to escape a vigilante attack			1
" does it sound crazy ? yes			0
but knowing that my boys will have a few extra seconds to get out of the house and slip into darkness if someone ever comes provides some measure of comfort , " @entity177 said			0
having a son on the registry also made a lasting impression on his mother			1
she now devotes most of her time to reforming sex offender legislation -- specifically , the registry -- as chief operating officer of @entity193			1
" what keeps me going ? my anger , my guilt , " she said			0
" my ignorance is why @entity41 's on this registry , or was on this registry			2
i did n't know the law			0
i did n't know how to protect my son when he talked to those cops			0
i just sat there thinking the truth will set him free			0
and that 's what got @entity45 convicted , the truth			0
" @entity3 's story comes at a time of increased push - back against sex offender policies that some see as overly broad			1
many states have been resisting toughening their sex offender policies			1
only one state , @entity217 , has complied with the federal @entity218 of 2006 , which lists sex offenders as young as 14 on a uniform registry			2
in @entity222 , the @entity221 is challenging a state law prohibiting sex offenders from living and working within 1,000 feet of a school , church or day care			2
@entity222 's laws go so far as to ban sex offenders from living near bus stops			2
the case is still pending			0
last summer , the @entity232 filed a lawsuit against @entity234 , alleging the county 's 2,500 - foot residency restriction interfered with @entity238 's ability to monitor and supervise released offenders			0
with nowhere to live , dozens of homeless sex offenders clustered under the @entity241			0
the lawsuit was dismissed in september 2009			0
meanwhile , @entity3 was just trying to graduate from high school			2
he attempted to enroll but was told that he was considered a danger to the rest of the students			0
he could n't take @entity248 classes at the vocational school in town because of an on - campus day care center			0
his mother persuaded the school board to provide him with a tutor and private classes at the local police department , under the supervision of an officer			0
finding a job presented its own challenges			0
he says he was turned down by @entity261 , @entity262 and another fast food outlet that told him he was considered a liability			0
he spent most days at home learning to build web sites and helping his mother and brother			0
due in large part to the efforts of his mother , the @entity269 last year passed the law that makes expungements of certain sex offenses in other jurisdictions applicable in @entity1			1
@entity3 traded in his driver 's license for one that does not label him a sex offender , and has since returned to the mall and a movie theater			1
" i know what i did was wrong and i deserved to be punished for it			0
but this destroyed my life			0
took it away from me , " he said			0
" you never forget about it			0
i know i 'm off the registry but it 's taking a long time for it to settle in			2
" in november , @entity3 received a letter from the @entity292			2
it said he had been removed from the state 's sex offender registry , where he had been designated the highest level of risk possible			1
his return to a " normal " life has been slow			0
he still is reluctant to go to his brother 's football games , and the thought of going to places where children convene makes him nervous			2
" i know i 'm off the registry but others may not know , " he said			0
" i do n't want to go somewhere and cause a scene ' cause people may not know that i 'm allowed to be there and get upset			0
" but he is making progress			0
he has opened up to friends and relatives outside his immediate family			0
he married a 19 - year - old childhood friend after he completed probation in september			0
as a @entity317 gift to her , @entity3 made his way to the @entity320 , where his wife sang in the choir			2
walking arm - in - arm with his mother into a building from which he once had been banned , he slowly made his way up the gymnasium 's bleachers			2
from his seat in the fifth row next to relatives , @entity3 trained his eyes on people entering the gymnasium , cautiously returning a wave or smile from an acquaintance			2
how did he feel ? " nervous , " he said			0
" it 's still new to me			0
" @entity2 's @entity338 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 landed on the sex offender registry when he was 16
he admits having sex with a girl , 13 , but says he thought she was 15
his record followed him from @entity18 after he and his mother moved to @entity1
