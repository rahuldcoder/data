-- the most important question facing @entity2 today is : how do we move @entity4 forward ? this question guides everything we do at @entity6			1
from health care to taxes to environmental issues , we fight for policies that would give every @entity4 the best shot at a better life			2
but politicians in @entity2 do n't want to answer this question			1
even if they tried , they would n't know where to start			2
they 're too busy attacking anyone with whom they disagree			0
exhibit a : writing on these pages several days ago , @entity19 from @entity20 declared that we want to " buy elections " and pursue a " self - serving " agenda			1
exhibit b : senate majority leader @entity26 regularly takes to the @entity28 floor to denounce groups like @entity6 as " un-american			0
" moreover , everything we say , according to @entity26 , is " untrue			0
" dozens of @entity28 and @entity34 candidates have since parroted @entity26 's baseless assertions in stump speeches , campaign e-mails , and more			2
this is nothing more than the politics of personal destruction			1
yet personal attacks are all they have in their playbook			1
@entity2 's record from the past few years does n't stand up to scrutiny -- and they know it			1
they ca n't show how they 've helped the people they claim to represent			0
millions of @entity4 have been harmed by their bankrupt policies and broken promises			1
look no further than @entity53 for proof			1
it has been nothing but a burden on hard - working @entity4 families			2
the country deserves to hear their stories			0
for months , we 've worked with middle - class families in states like @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , and elsewhere			2
@entity53 canceled their plans and forced them to buy health insurance that they did n't want and could n't afford			1
between 6 and 9 million families experienced similar problems firsthand			0
millions more found out that their new plans do n't include their doctors or cost far more than expected			0
everywhere we look , people are paying more but getting less			0
their response ? call these people liars			0
it 's a similar story with @entity2 's current energy policies			1
these , too , attack middle - class @entity4			2
take the example of the @entity84 regulations unveiled on june 2			0
it does n't take an economist to see that these rules will increase electricity costs on families and businesses and kill jobs			0
even the @entity92 admits that " jobs will indeed be lost " and " costs imposed " by the new rules			0
these costs will disproportionately harm the middle class and the poor , who pay a greater percentage of their income on electricity and everyday goods			0
as for the effect on the climate ? the @entity84 's own data shows that the new rules will only prevent 0.018 degrees @entity106 of warming between now and 2100			2
ask the @entity4 who lose their jobs whether this nearly nonexistent change is worth it			0
@entity2 's solution to every problem is to create a bureaucracy and lavish it with billions in taxpayer dollars			1
in return we get the @entity119 , the @entity120 , and bureaucracies that can barely function or actively harm @entity4			0
meanwhile , @entity2 's demands for higher taxes will stifle small business growth and job creation even though the economy is stalled and labor force participation is hovering near record lows			1
ditto for the years of trillion dollar deficits and the $ 17.5 trillion dollar debt , which has nearly doubled since president @entity132 took office			0
such unchecked , out - of - control spending -- which many in @entity2 only want to expand -- will harm our economy and @entity4 families for generations for to come			1
this is @entity2 's record			1
such big government policies hobble the economy and harm the middle class , who invariably have to pick up the tab			2
but rather than help people , @entity2 's defenders attack us for pointing this out			1
we 're fighting to create a better future -- but @entity2 is too busy holding @entity4 back			1
join us on @entity150 / @entity149 .			0

@entity152 responds to op - ed attacks from @entity19 of @entity155 21st century
he calls the attacks nothing more than politics of personal destruction
he points to @entity53 , energy policies and @entity164 failings as proof @entity2 is broken
@entity2 's solution to every problem , he says , is to create a bureaucracy
