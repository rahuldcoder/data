-- hundreds turned out in two @entity3 cities friday to protest on what had been billed as a " day of rage , " according to activists , though a planned demonstration in the @entity10 nation 's capital failed to materialize			1
the protests -- both made up largely of @entity13 calling for the release of @entity13 prisoners -- occurred despite a @entity3 government ban on all kinds of public demonstrations			1
demonstrators in @entity21 , a city about 300 kilometers ( 185 miles ) east of the @entity3 capital of @entity23 , began their march after friday prayers , two activists told @entity0			1
they asked not to be identified because of security concerns and fear of reprisals			0
three demonstrators were arrested by @entity3 security forces , the activists said			1
the streets of @entity33 , a predominantly @entity13 city in eastern @entity3 where several protests have taken place in recent days , were quiet early friday			1
@entity36 , a @entity3 human rights activist , told @entity0 that he saw " no people in the streets and virtually no security presence			1
" but by friday night , about 200 people were out demonstrating near @entity33 , according to a @entity13 activist			1
@entity3 security forces were out and observed them , but there were no apparent arrests as the march ended peacefully			2
in the @entity3 capital , @entity45 , who heads the @entity46 , told @entity0 that authorities had set up checkpoints on roads leading to the planned staging ground north of @entity23 near a courthouse			2
" so far , i 'm seeing no protesters out there , " he said earlier friday			0
these demonstrations came a day after more than 100 people had gathered in @entity33 , according to two witnesses and an activist			1
at some point , the witnesses said , @entity3 security forces shot to disperse the crowd			2
it was unknown if the forces fired rubber bullets or more lethal ammunition			0
those injured were taken to @entity69 for treatment , the activist and witnesses said			0
a human rights group in @entity3 condemned the action , calling the use of force by police " deplorable			2
" " ( the group ) condemns , with the loudest and clearest words , the use of all kinds of force to disperse demonstrators particularly when live ammunition was used last night against the demonstrators in @entity33 , " the @entity78 said in a statement released friday			0
last week , about 24 protesters were detained in @entity33 as they denounced " the prolonged detention " of nine @entity13 prisoners held without trial for more than 14 years , @entity86 said			0
the protests in @entity3 come as unrest brews in parts of the @entity10 and @entity94 and has caused major changes in places like @entity97 and @entity98			1
some in the majority @entity100 kingdom have followed similar demands across the @entity103 world for more freedom and democracy			0
still , one expert said he would be surprised if the demonstrations gained traction among the @entity3 majority , noting that there does not appear to a high level of animosity toward the nation 's rulers as there are in other countries			2
" the big difference is that people in @entity3 do n't want a revolution to happen -- they just want more reforms and liberalization , " said @entity117 , a @entity3 expert with the @entity118 think tank			1
" i really think the vast majority of the people there , no matter what they think of the government , they probably like the @entity130 , " he added			0
" @entity131 is still very popular			0
" @entity0 's @entity132 contributed to this report .			0
