-- what happens on social media does n't always stay on social media			1
that may be the unfortunate lesson for those who 've recently had private photos accessed and shared due to a privacy gap on the photo - sharing website @entity11			1
nude , explicit , and r - rated images uploaded on the social media site were in some cases made available to view on public web forums dedicated to exploiting @entity11 's privacy settings			1
the breach was first reported last week by @entity18			0
the breach of privacy " is a very rare occurrence that has affected only a small number of @entity11 's users , " said @entity11 spokesman @entity19			0
but the forums , some filled with stolen racy pictures and others with instructions on how to access more , have drawn thousands of viewers			0
while users who post unencrypted photos on @entity11 can make their albums password protected , individual photos , even in a private album , can be shared with others through a direct web link or url			1
hackers versed in @entity11 's privacy settings can access unencrypted pictures in password - protected albums by using software that deduces the direct web link , a practice commonly known as " fusking			1
" with a @entity11 username and a list of common titles for photos , fusking software can extract images from private albums by finding patterns in the posted pictures			1
for instance , if an album has an image titled @entity59 , hackers may deduce that there is an @entity62 and @entity63			0
they can then access the images by guessing the direct link , even if the photos are in a password protected album			2
@entity11 says it 's aware of fusking and has made efforts to limit the number of accounts hacked			2
" scrambled urls have been an option for the past two years and will be the default for all new uploads , " @entity19 said			2
" the company is in the process of reminding users about the option to scramble @entity74 to prevent fusking			0
" the scrambled urls make it more difficult for hackers to guess sequences of images and find those meant to be kept secret			1
but if users have not applied the encryption , photos may remain vulnerable			0
" there are additional technical flags and safeguards in place when we suspect that fusking is being attempted ; however , we have also taken several actions that will plug any existing holes that allow this activity , " @entity19 added			0
" privacy settings on social media sites just ca n't keep up with how fast technology is adapting , " said @entity98 , a social media attorney in @entity99			1
" as sites get more private , hackers and people who want to get more information will continue to get more sophisticated			2
" the responsibility , however , ultimately rests with the user			0
" what you say and do on social media can be used against you and it can be found , " @entity98 added			2
" if you do n't want someone else to see it , do n't post it			0

some private photos on @entity11 were *improperly* accessed and shared
hackers using a practice known as " fusking " to gain access to images
@entity11 to start using scrambled urls to combat fusking
" social media sites just ca n't keep up " with hackers , social media attorney says
