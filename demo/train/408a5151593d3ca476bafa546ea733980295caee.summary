-- monsignor @entity1 , the highest - ranking cleric accused of imperiling children by helping cover up sexual abuse , was found guilty friday of one count of child endangerment			1
he was found not guilty on a second count of endangerment and a conspiracy charge to protect a priest accused of abuse			1
the jury was unable to bring a verdict against his co-defendant , the rev. @entity13 , who was charged with attempted rape of a 14 - year - old altar boy and endangering the welfare of a child			1
@entity1 was taken into custody after friday 's verdict , when the judge revoked his bail			1
his lawyer , @entity23 , derided the decision not to let his client remain free on bond prior to sentencing , calling it " an unspeakable miscarriage of justice ( for ) a 61 - year - old man with no prior record and long established ties to the community			1
" he is set to be sentenced august 13 , court officials said , and could face up to seven years in prison for his conviction on a third - degree felony			0
the trial marked the first time @entity40 prosecutors charged not just priests who allegedly committed abuses but church leaders for failing to stop them			2
calling the verdict " historic , " @entity45 district attorney @entity44 said friday 's decision sends a message about potential consequences of not reporting sexual abuse			1
" many people of many generations have unclean hands when it comes to this silence , " @entity44 said , adding that others could also be investigated			0
@entity57 , who heads the advocacy website @entity59 , called the conviction " a watershed moment in the @entity63 abuse crisis			0
" " because of the @entity1 verdict , bishops and church officials are now accountable			1
they are no longer immune from judgment and punishment , " @entity57 said			0
and @entity69 , a victims ' rights attorney , said the jury 's verdict friday -- as well as the decision by now - defrocked priest @entity74 to plead guilty after admitting to sexually assaulting a 10 - year - old altar boy -- suggests " the picture is now clear that the @entity45 archdiocese permitted crimes against children			1
" the archdiocese issued its own statement after the verdict , though it did not mention the trial or either @entity83 or @entity13 by name			2
it did , however , insist that " the lessons of the last year have made our @entity87 a more vigilant guardian of our people 's safety			2
" " the @entity91 is on a journey of reform and renewal that requires honesty and hope , " it said			0
" we are committed to providing support and assistance to parishioners as they and the @entity87 seek to more deeply understand sexual violence , and to create an environment that is safe and welcoming to all , including past victims			0
" attorneys : @entity104 ordered memo on priests destroyed @entity1 's attorney said he felt the jury agreed there was no " far flung conspiracy , " though he conceded the prosecution " scored a victory " in securing the lone conviction -- one that made he and the monsignor " extremely upset			1
" " by finding him guilty , they 're saying he helped endanger children , " @entity23 said			2
" it 's the last thing he wanted to do			0
... i do n't think he 's the evil person the district attorney is making him out to be			1
" @entity125 of the @entity126 , an advocacy group devoted to challenging defamation of or discrimination against @entity129 , called the verdict a defeat for overzealous prosecutors and victims advocates who he claimed had unfairly targeted church leaders			0
" the witch hunt has come to an end , and those who have been clamoring for blood lost big time , " @entity125 said in a statement			0
" they wanted the big prize -- they wanted to nail a high - ranking clergyman on conspiracy			0
... looks like their car ran out of gas in @entity45			2
" more than 60 witnesses and alleged clergy abuse victims testified during @entity1 and @entity13 's criminal trial , which began march 26 and wrapped up may 31 , with jury deliberations beginning the next day			1
@entity1 's defense team argued that their client repeatedly told higher - ups about the alleged abuse and , under strict orders from late cardinal @entity161 , had no authority to remove priests from the ministry			2
assistant district attorney @entity165 characterized @entity1 's behavior as " disgraceful , " " shameful " and " ridiculous , " sarcastically calling him a " hero " who put young people in harm 's way			1
" he actually looked you in the eye and said he put victims first			0
how dare he ? " the prosecutor asked jurors during his more than 2Â½ - hour closing argument			0
@entity1 's conspiracy count related to an allegation that he schemed with @entity74 and other archdiocese officials to endanger children			1
@entity74 had been due to go on trial with @entity13 and @entity1 , but he pleaded guilty in march to a sexual assault that occurred during the 1998 - 99 school year			1
the 69 - year - old was sentenced to 2Â½ to five years in prison			0
@entity13 himself was removed from the active ministry in 2006			2
two years later , he admitted that he had allowed the youngster to view pornography and sleep in the same bed with him in 1996 , according to church investigators ' testimony			0
