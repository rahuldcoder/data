@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 chancellor @entity3 launched an outspoken defense of the @entity7 project on wednesday , but warned that the bloc 's richest nation would not make bailout promises to solve the eurozone crisis that it can not keep			1
speaking at the annual @entity13 in the @entity1 resort of @entity0 , @entity3 said @entity4 is rightly seen as being relatively strong			1
but if her country commits to paying for a huge expansion of the eurozone 's bailout funds , and even that is torpedoed by the capital markets , then there is a real problem			0
@entity3 told a standing room - only crowd that the " people say it has to be double , then it has to be triple , then we will believe you			2
" " we have said right from the start we wish to stand up for the euro , but we do n't want to ... make a promise that we ca n't fulfil			0
" map : @entity7 in crisis the eurozone set up a temporary bail - out fund -- the @entity35 -- after @entity37 's first bail - out in may 2010			2
it initially had € 250 billion ( $ 326 billion ) in lending capacity , which was later boosted to € 440 billion as more eurozone countries stumbled			0
the creation of the eurozone 's permanent facility , the @entity44 , was brought forward and it will now be in place this year rather than 2013			0
it will have lending capacity of € 500 billion , and is backed by paid - in capital from eurozone member countries			0
@entity50 : will new deal solve @entity7 's problems ? @entity3 appeared to show her frustration with the rest of the @entity7 community , some of whose members are suspicious of the motives of the bloc 's two strongest economies			1
" it is on the one hand expected from @entity4 and @entity64 that we show a harmonious front			2
" they do n't like us when we do n't like each other and they do n't like us when we agree on matters before we come here because then we are the ones that call the shots apparently , and that is frustrating			0
" @entity3 also warned that the structure of the " great @entity7 project " needed substantive reform if the crisis that has brought the @entity7 single currency to the brink of collapse is to be resolved			1
" there is a clear lack of political structures and underpinnings to make this work			0
" she was speaking the day after the @entity84 lowered its outlook for the world economy			1
it called for immediate action to avert a global depression -- raising the specter of the downturn of the 1920s			0
the @entity84 now expects the world economy to grow 3.3 % in 2012 , compared to its previous prediction of 4 % expansion this year			1
the pessimistic outlook was mainly driven by the intensifying debt crisis in @entity7 , with the 17 nations of the eurozone expected to suffer a mild recession this year , the @entity84 said			1
" we are not going to become fainthearted			0
we will not be able to wave a magic wand to address this , " she told delegates in @entity0 , adding that there was " a clear erosion of confidence " in the rest of the world with @entity7			1
in comments that could cause concerns about @entity4 's growing influence in @entity7 , @entity3 said : " we have seen that something needs to be changed here , so it is not only austerity measures ... but also structural reforms that lead to more jobs			1
" outside the conference hall , @entity120 , head of advertising giant @entity121 , said @entity3 's " call for greater political unity was the price for @entity4 bailing @entity37 out and putting a firewall around @entity127 to avoid severe contagion " in world markets			1
@entity120 said her call for stronger fiscal and political integration in @entity7 could mean further confrontation between @entity3 and @entity64 president @entity134 and @entity136 's prime minister @entity135			1
@entity138 leaders agreed in october to provide a second € 130 billion rescue package for @entity37 and announced a deal with private sector investors to voluntarily write down the value of @entity37 government bonds by 50 % as part of a debt exchange			0
but on tuesday a major credit agency warned that @entity37 will eventually default on its debts , even if the nation reaches a restructuring deal with creditors			0
negotiations with the private sector have also stalled and there is disagreement among some policymakers over whether requiring @entity37 to enact more austerity as a condition of a second bailout will help or hurt the nation 's fragile economy			2
@entity3 , who with @entity134 , has been at the heart of efforts to rescue the eurozone from the debt crisis , conceded in a newspaper interview published on wednesday she did have doubts about her demand for more fiscal rigor from debt - ridden governments , which have met widespread opposition			2
" good politicians always have doubts , as a way of constantly reviewing whether they are on the right track , " the @entity172 reported her as saying			0
nevertheless she insisted the @entity7 court of justice should enforce the public spending and budget policies of eurozone nations			2
and in another policy that sets her at odds with many euroskeptic politicians including @entity135 , @entity3 raised the specter of full @entity7 political union , with more national laws ceded to @entity187			1
the only good piece of news for @entity3 was that @entity4 business confidence brightened for a third month in a row , suggesting that growth may already be resuming in @entity7 's largest economy			1
