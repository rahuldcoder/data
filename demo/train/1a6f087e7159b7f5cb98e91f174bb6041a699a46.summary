@entity1 , @entity0 -- it 's a spring break with a purpose : ten days in @entity0 when the entertainment and tech worlds collide on the neo-bohemian streets of this @entity0 party town			1
the annual @entity11 festival will have its share of parties for the tens of thousands who will attend			1
but it will also be showcasing the best and brightest in its three main subject areas : music , film and interactive ( read startups , technology and the @entity21 )			2
it 's a lot to try to keep up with			0
so here , broken down by the three major divisions of the fest , are some of the expected highlights we 'll be keeping an eye on			0
interactive it could be ideas , not apps that win the day at this year 's interactive gathering			2
if there 's a new @entity37 , @entity38 or @entity39 preparing to break out next week , nobody has pegged it yet			1
in fact , some of the most " buzzworthy " apps pre-festival are the location - based " discovery " apps that were supposed to be all the rage last year			0
( and which , by and large , have underwhelmed most digital travelers and may soon face competition from @entity38 )			0
so , if no app leaps to the forefront ( and , in fairness , it may take a couple of years to figure out if one did ) , what will ? how about outer space ? @entity57 , ceo of @entity58 , will be speaking at the festival just days after an unmanned freighter owned by the private company arrived with supplies at the @entity63			1
it was the second of 12 missions @entity58 will fly for @entity66 in the wake of the space shuttle program shutting down			2
there are no fewer than 15 space - related panels scheduled for interactive week , including one featuring the @entity21 's viral star of last year 's @entity73 rover landing : @entity66 " @entity74 " @entity74			2
while gadgets have never been @entity11 's forte -- ceding that to the glitzier @entity77 in @entity78 -- practical applications for emerging tech like @entity81 , 3 - d printers and wearable gizmos like @entity85 's rumored " @entity84 " could be on the minds of the technorati gathered in @entity0			1
other featured speakers at the interactive portion of the festival include @entity91 , who as founder of @entity91 seeks to shake up the video game industry with a $ 99 @entity96 - based console that raised $ 8 million on @entity97 , and @entity98 , creator of wildly popular webcomic " @entity101			2
yes , @entity102 , who is expected to talk about how he followed @entity104 stardom by becoming a social - media pioneer			0
his online presence once led @entity37 co-founder @entity107 to say the site " would n't be what it is today " without @entity102			2
movies @entity112 is still the best - known name , but @entity11 has become another top destination for filmmakers hoping to launch an independent film or create buzz for a coming studio release			1
having successfully stirred interest in his " @entity120 " in @entity1 last year , writer and director @entity123 is back this year to work with @entity124			2
@entity123 shot his black - and - white take on @entity124 's " @entity126 " during his off days from filming " @entity127 " and he relies on an ensemble cast from his stable of regulars -- including " @entity133 " alum turned " @entity132 " star @entity131			2
as far as big names go , the festival tops out with @entity136 and @entity137 in the comedy " @entity139			0
" it 's a quirky tale , a battle between rival @entity78 magicians , and seems tailor - made for a @entity145 crowd			0
the second coming of cult favorite " @entity148 " will also be showcasing , as will " @entity149 " starring @entity150 , " @entity151 " with @entity152 and @entity153 and @entity155 's " @entity154			0
" documentaries are always big at the festival and , this year , " @entity162 " will bring together film and interactive with a doc about the life of famed physicist @entity162			0
the film , which will air on @entity164 later this year , featured exclusive access to @entity162 's life , is narrated in his own voice and includes contributors ranging from sir @entity169 to astronaut @entity170 to actors @entity136 and @entity172			0
music in its secret heart , @entity11 will always be about the music			1
founded 26 years ago to showcase the burgeoning , eclectic music bubbling up deep in the heart of @entity0 , the festival has become the music world 's most well - known and eagerly anticipated annual showcase			1
more than 2,200 bands turned virtually every square foot of the city into a music hall last year , and organizers promise to ramp it up even more in 2013			0
most of the acts that play wo n't leave @entity1 with a big contract			1
but it 's worth noting that @entity192 was considered @entity11 's musical breakout last year , just months before the group won the @entity195			1
established artists will be hitting stages in @entity1 as well			0
@entity198 , the band that took snarly punk rock all the way to @entity201 , will play one of this year 's most anticipated sets			1
the performance will be their first major showcase since front man @entity206 checked himself into rehab seven months ago for what he called a drug - and alcohol relapse that culminated in a profanity - laced rant onstage in @entity78			1
@entity210 has parlayed his drummer gig for one of the most influential rock bands of the last quarter - century ( that 's @entity214 , in case you forgot ) into the front man role with perennial @entity195 winner @entity218 and is now a sort of de facto spokesman for the world of rock			1
he 'll be the music keynote speaker for the festival			0
@entity210 will also be playing with his latest project , @entity226 , which , against all logic , brings together artists ranging from @entity229 and @entity230 to @entity232 's @entity231 to members of @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236			0
punk - rock icons @entity237 will play , as will gothic troubadour @entity239 , psych rockers @entity241 and reunited @entity243 ska act @entity244			0
pop star / actor @entity245 , who has become a bit of a tech entrepreneur in recent years , is hosting a private party and rumored to be pondering a surprise gig himself .			1

@entity11 is a 10 - day music , film and tech festival in @entity1 , @entity0
past @entity256 have helped launch @entity37 , @entity39 and *numerous* indie bands
@entity198 will play an anticipated gig after singer @entity206 's rehab
@entity58 's @entity57 highlights a new look at private *spaceflight*
