@entity0 -- the tumultuous months since january 2011 have confronted @entity2 with uncertainty , triumph and despair on an almost daily basis			1
but for one @entity8 - based artist , the violence , disruptions and ambiguities of the revolution have also inspired a burst of unprecedented productivity			1
@entity8 , @entity15 -- @entity17 's first solo show in the @entity18 -- contains just a portion of the work she has produced in reckoning with the upheaval reshaping her country			1
" any artist , wherever they are , responds to their surroundings , " she said			1
" it just happens to be that what is happening here is a revolution			2
" the year following the revolution saw her produce five different bodies of work -- combining elements of photography and painting -- incorporating images from the 70,000 or so snapshots she has taken of events in @entity43 and the surrounding neighborhoods			1
" i have never done five bodies of work over such a short period , i do n't think many people have , " she said			2
" i was responding to each and every feeling i was getting , because everything is moving very quickly			0
one day you think there 's no hope , the next you think there 's a lot			2
" see also : artists reflect @entity2 's revolutionary spirit @entity59 initially went out every day with her camera , " plunging " herself into @entity43 to document the turmoil playing out around her : " the army , the people taking care of the people on the street			1
" after that , she said , " when the police were beating up people in the street , " she turned to sourcing images of the revolution from the internet			2
she placed the images incongruously against utopian , postcard scenes from nature -- mountains , flowers and green fields -- or against backdrops modeled on the stylized landscapes of traditional @entity86 screens			0
her goal with some of the works was to " conjure harmony " and hope , she said			0
@entity59 said the momentous events of the revolution were something every @entity2 artist would be drawn to address in their own way , either explicitly or implicitly			1
" if other artists have n't yet , they will , " she said			0
" even if they do n't do it directly , psychologically things will change			0
" see also : young upstarts plotting @entity102 art revolution but she added that it was too early to say whether the revolution would trigger a lasting artistic revival in her homeland			1
@entity59 's work was censored under the old regime -- " i took some pictures of the state - run mental asylum and they did n't like that , " she said -- and she believed it remained to be seen whether there would be greater space in the new @entity2 for artistic expression			1
" maybe perhaps now things will be different ; maybe the idea of democracy will allow people to express how they feel , " she said			0
" but for the time being , we have no clue			0
" the exhibition runs until august 24 at the @entity128 , @entity0			0
