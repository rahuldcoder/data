a 20 - minute drive from @entity1 takes you to a neighborhood that feels more like @entity4 than central @entity5			1
in a quiet oasis , huge mansions sit on lush lawns behind gilded gates			2
private security guards stand watch over quiet , tree - lined streets			2
you 'd never know you 're in a country in the midst of a violent conflict , with near daily reports of intense battles killing soldiers , pro-russian separatists , and civilians -- including children			2
these are the mansions that rose when the @entity24 fell			2
and this is where many of @entity1 's new rich are riding out the crisis , far from the front lines of eastern @entity5			1
here , we find @entity1 millionaire @entity31 sitting nervously on his grandiose outdoor patio			2
he is surrounded by the spoils of a successful construction business and restaurant chain			0
@entity31 -- with a shaved head , tattoos , and muscled physique -- does n't look like your stereotypical fat cat millionaire			0
he looks tough , rugged -- and fearful for his country			0
" if we sit and enjoy life here the [ the war ] will come to us also , " he tells me			0
@entity31 worries about the struggling @entity5 military			1
for years it had been ill equipped , untrained , and underfunded			0
now , he and his twin brother are part of a growing group of @entity5 's mega rich making massive military contributions			1
@entity31 has donated $ 450,000 -- a figure funded , in part , by the sale of his @entity55 -- to the military to supply soldiers with weapons , uniforms , and supplies			1
" i can live without [ my ] @entity55			0
but now it 's difficult to live without enough arms , " he says			1
according to @entity65 , seven of @entity5 's 100 richest people have publicly donated to the military			1
prosecutors are investigating others on the @entity65 list for financing @entity71 rebels			1
the @entity72 says more than 2,000 people have died in eastern @entity5 since mid-april			1
many are civilian volunteers , who left their families and jobs to join the fight			0
what sets @entity31 apart from other wealthy @entity80 donors is the 53 - year - old 's background as a @entity24 soldier			1
now , he is a member of @entity5 's volunteer battalions			1
" if we do n't fight , than we will be humiliated and we will live in the same country as it was before , when there was corruption			0
[ the old government ] was robbing businesses , they were putting people in jail for nothing , " he says			1
he 's already done one rotation in @entity97 , and plans to return to the front lines			2
he knows that each day , volunteers like him die -- yet is ready to send his wife and children abroad , leave his mansion and join the fight			0
" of course i worry			0
but i hope for good luck , " he says			0
he hopes for a fast end to the fighting and the birth of a new , stronger @entity5			1
he hopes for a country with more jobs , and more millionaires like him			0
" first we have to finish the war			0
then we will look at what to do , " he says			0
@entity5 's supporters are also crowd - funding , raising $ 12 million for the country 's defense ministry in the latest campaign			1
the support comes despite the country 's fragile economy , falling salaries and weak currency .			2
