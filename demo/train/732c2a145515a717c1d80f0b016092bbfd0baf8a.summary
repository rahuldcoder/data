-- i 'm somewhere between a car camper and an outdoor enthusiast			2
it did take me over 10 months of owning hiking boots to actually start breaking them in , but i know how to build a campfire and i 'm not afraid of a few days without a shower			2
when my boyfriend , @entity9 , an @entity11 credit card - carrying outdoor adventurer , mentioned he wanted to do the four - day , 31 - mile @entity13 hike in @entity14 in june , i was excited for the chance to prove that i was more of a backpacker than he thought			1
i expected to be challenged mentally and physically , and as time would tell , it was for good reason			2
we encountered almost every type of backcountry terrain -- me with a 30 - pound pack on my back and @entity9 carrying a 50 - pound pack			1
an hour into our hike , we met @entity28 and @entity29 , two men who coincidentally planned the same trek			1
their companionship was a godsend to both groups			2
when i was safely out of the woods ( literally ) , i talked to @entity36 , the @entity38 's " @entity37 , " about our experience to see what we did right and what we could have done better			1
12 @entity43 secrets the rockslides we began on a trail where rockslides had overtaken multiple parts of the route , littering our path with large boulders			1
it would have been easier on a day hike with smaller packs , but we had to stay conscious of our body weight with the added weight of our gear on the unstable terrain			1
we reached a point where we had to head vertically from our location			0
it turns out when blazing the trail , crews began at separate ends and never met			1
we had missed the first marker telling us to head up the hill but now caught the second marker			0
going up looked easier than it was -- recent rain had left the hill muddy and covered with loose rocks that were easily dislodged			0
for fear of us both walking into a dangerous situation , @entity9 decided to get both packs up to the trail before coming back to find a safer route for me			1
luckily , @entity29 and @entity28 had hit the first marker and waited for @entity9 at the top of the hill			0
without their help , it would have been a challenge to get both packs up to the trail			1
survivorman says : " when climbing over difficult terrain , look at what 's beneath your feet			1
step back and look at what 's before you			1
you get a better picture when you step backwards and get a look at everything			0
it 's also important in these situations that it 's not about speed			1
@entity96 will kill you in a survival situation			0
if you 're walking into trouble , walking faster means you walk into it faster			0
" @entity101 a road worth traveling a wrong turn and snow with the rockslides behind us , the four of us hiked and made camp while it was still light out			0
i 'll admit , i thought about calling the trip off that night			0
but the next day , we decided we could still accomplish part of the hike			1
the group agreed to cut the trip a day shorter and hike out a different trail			1
that morning was a steady climb through the forest and then up a granite slope			0
from the very beginning , we consulted a gps , two topography maps and a compass			1
when we hit the granite slope , the @entity120 showed that we were a bit off , but still heading in the right direction to meet back up with the trail			1
with views of sharp cliffs striped with waterfalls and rows of steep mountains covered in trees , i joked that we had stumbled upon the scenic route			1
even with the view , the granite seemed like it would never end			0
when it did , a huge expanse of snow stretched out in front of us			0
the rangers had mentioned it was abnormal to have snow in june but said we would hit it at @entity142 ; this snow was much sooner			0
our rented snowshoes combined with @entity28 and @entity29 's walking sticks helped immensely			1
with the snowdrifts more than 6 feet deep at points , @entity9 and @entity28 took the snowshoes to punch out a more solid path for @entity29 and me			0
as the afternoon progressed , we realized that we were n't seeing trail markers on the trees -- only two after four hours of solid hiking			1
the gps and maps were also giving slightly varied directions , so we stopped every few minutes to orient ourselves			1
@entity37 says : " if you know you 're going off course , mark your trail			1
make deep snowshoes in a snowbank			0
turn over or stack rocks			0
as you 're going forward , stop , and look backwards because the trail does not look the same going back			1
if you end up doubling back and you do n't do that , you do n't have the perspective of what it 's like going back			1
there 's no harm in going back to where the blaze or trail was and really scan , like a camera in pan mode , to see the natural path of least resistance			1
that 's probably the path the people before you took			1
" 8 perfect summer lake towns making the call with our early start , we should have had plenty of time to cover the six miles to @entity142			0
after hiking a good four miles , it was still nowhere in sight			0
with snow on the ground and quick - moving storms possible at our altitude , we hit a turning point around 3 p.m. we could hear a creek but could n't figure out if it was the creek labeled on the map			1
we continued to head east in hopes of finding the right creek , but the clouds were changing quickly and each moment we spent venturing meant a longer haul to a safe camping spot			2
from the very first hour , our group 's motto was " do n't do anything stupid			1
" after weighing the options , i felt it would be a risk to keep plowing into uncertainty			0
our group talked about the variables and opted to be safe rather than sorry			2
we made quick time back to a campsite we had seen earlier , an ideal , snow - free area with trees on three sides for cover from the elements			2
we set up camp and spent the night regrouping , changing our plans yet again			0
we would wake up early and double back to our old campsite , then take an alternate route , with creek crossings rather than rockslides , out of the forest			2
@entity37 says : " once you get into panic mode , one of the things you need is knowledge			0
what do i have on me ? am i injured ? how much food do i have ? you keep assessing outward			0
@entity233 , external , big external			0
now you have knowledge and you can make a decision			0
remember that survival is active , not a passive pursuit			0
you have to actively choose			0
" creek crossings we woke up at sunrise and set out following our tracks from the day before			2
with a clear trail of footsteps to follow , we covered ground at twice the speed			2
we hit our original campsite earlier than expected and soon were on the trail that led to the creek crossings			1
fellow hikers along the trail told us we 'd need to take our socks and boots off to cross the two creeks			1
both had rushing water and rocky , often slick , beds			0
the first creek came up to our knees			0
the second was about 3 feet deep and 20 feet wide			0
when we hit the second one , we all gave each other looks that said , " really ? are we crazy ? " we had to cross sooner or later , so we decided on the safest route , and i took my boots off and hung them around my neck			2
using walking sticks , i went in , testing out each step before i took it			0
the three men followed , and all of us emerged drenched from the waist down but with all our gear intact			2
@entity37 says : " keep your gear			2
try to never abandon your gear			2
we had conquered the last big challenge we 'd face on the trail			2
you never know what you 're capable of until you have no other choice ; as a newbie to backpacking , that was probably the most gratifying thought i walked away with from my trip to @entity14			1
though we never completed our original route , the journey was worth it			2
with civilization less than three miles away , the sun shining and a hot shower and a cold beer waiting , it seemed like everything from that point on was a walk in the park .			0

a four - day , 31 - mile hike along @entity14 's @entity13 did n't go exactly as planned
*weather* and difficulty finding trail markers led hikers to change their planned route
the hikers endured different types of terrain and multiple challenges
the group was prepared with gps , maps , a compass and gear for various *conditions*
