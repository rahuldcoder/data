@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 prime minister @entity3 faces a no - confidence motion in parliament as opposition forces in the @entity8 nation try to unseat the government through legal means			1
the vote is currently scheduled for thursday , but the opposition 's chances of success appear slim , as @entity3 's party has a majority			1
protesters are calling for an end to the government of @entity3 , sister of former premier @entity20 , the telecommunications tycoon who was ousted in a 2006 coup			1
critics of the @entity1 prime minister accuse her of being a puppet of her older brother @entity20 , a deeply polarizing figure who was removed from power by the military while in @entity30 in 2006			1
he has since lived in exile , except for a brief return in 2008 , and was convicted by @entity1 courts for corruption and sentenced in absentia to two years in jail later that year			2
meanwhile , thousands of anti-government demonstrators have kept up pressure on the @entity1 government in recent days by surrounding official buildings amid the highest tensions the country has seen since deadly unrest three years ago			1
protesters in @entity0 stormed the finance ministry building monday and turned into their secondary command center			2
they planned to send groups to a range of other ministries and government offices around the capital wednesday , said @entity54 , a spokesman for the protesters			1

at various points during the past few days , demonstrators have surrounded the foreign ministry , as well as the agriculture and interior ministries			0
@entity3 has said authorities will " absolutely not use violence " to disperse the demonstrators			2
but the situation is delicate after @entity1 police issued an arrest warrant against protest leader @entity101			2

authorities have extended the areas around @entity0 where police are enforcing an internal security law that restricts gatherings by demonstrators			0
political fault lines the current protests have reanimated the tensions along @entity1 's political fault lines -- @entity20 's mostly rural support base on one side , the @entity0 - based elite and middle classes on the other -- that left the country wracked with turbulence for four years after the 2006 coup , culminating in a 2010 army crackdown on @entity20 supporters that left more than 90 dead			1
the current round of protests was triggered in response to a government - backed amnesty bill that could have extended a pardon to @entity20 and opened the door for his return to @entity1			1
