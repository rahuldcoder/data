-- after a couple of weather delays , @entity1 finally launched its moon research mission saturday morning			1
called grail , the effort will study how the moon was formed			1
it will explore " the structure of the lunar interior , from crust to core ... to advance understanding of the thermal evolution of the moon , " @entity1 said			0
two lunar orbiters are aboard a @entity17 rocket , which launched from @entity18 , @entity19			1
the crafts -- grail - a and @entity6 -- will eventually separate from the @entity17 rocket			2
once in orbit , the orbiters ' speeds will increase when they pass over formations on the moon 's surface , allowing scientists to measure those formations based on the distance between the two spacecraft			2
" trying to understand how the moon formed , and how it evolved over its history , is one of the things we 're trying to address with the grail mission , " says @entity32 , principal investigator for grail from the @entity33			1
" but also , ( we 're ) trying to understand how the moon is an example of how terrestrial planets in general have formed			0
" @entity1 says the mission is " the first time students have a dedicated camera on board a planetary spacecraft			0
" teachers will be able to register their classes and allow their students to explore specific regions of the moon in detail through pictures taken by the spacecraft			0
digital video imaging system called @entity6 will offer middle - school students the opportunity to request photography of lunar targets for classroom study			2
@entity63 , the first @entity64 woman to fly in space , heads the project .			0

@entity6 stands for @entity6
a rocket carrying two orbiters launched from @entity18
