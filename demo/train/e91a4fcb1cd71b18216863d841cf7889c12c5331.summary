-- @entity2 star @entity1 has proven she knows " @entity3 " to no. 1			1
the 20 - year - old actress and singer , already famous for @entity2 's " victorious " and now " @entity10 , " has spread her wings beyond kids tv into the music industry			1
her debut album , " yours truly , " arrived on september 3 and went straight to the top of the @entity14 chart			2
that not only solidifies @entity16 as a pop star to watch , but it also puts her in pretty rarefied company : according to @entity14 , she 's one of only 15 solo female artists whose debut albums have opened at no. 1			1
interestingly enough , that does n't include one of @entity16 's idols , @entity23 , whose influence is evident on some of " @entity26			1
" although @entity16 was n't born until 1993 , the record " honors ' 90s - style @entity29 , " and stands out as " one of the most purely enjoyable albums of the year , powered by her lithe , @entity35 - honed voice , " @entity27 says in its review			2
her taste for throwback sounds goes hand - in - hand with a more retro approach to crossing the treacherous boundary between kid entertainer and adult star : rather than trying to change her image through provocative sexual posturing , @entity16 seems to be relying solely on her voice			2
" i think everybody does what feels natural to them and that 's a great thing , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" if you 're doing things that make you feel happy and doing things that you 're confident in , that 's great			2
but for me , i just feel like i 've always been the same way			0
and i do n't feel like any need to shock people			0
i just want to sing			0
" there are inevitable comparisons with another all - grown - up - now child star , @entity63 , who is close in age			0
but @entity1 has said that she passes no judgment on her twerking colleague , and believes that everyone else should follow suit			1
when it comes to @entity63 ' controversial @entity73 performance this year , " she looked like she was having the time of her life			0
... there 's nothing wrong with having fun , " @entity1 told @entity74			1
" i think all the people who are saying mean things about it and who are judging , need to spend less time judging other people and more time worrying about how to have as much fun as she 's having in life right now			2
" besides , @entity1 noted -- she and @entity63 are doing different things			1
" i do n't feel much pressure to fit in			0
i never have , " she said			0
" i 've always just wanted to do my thing			0
i have really good friends and good family and if i do n't fit in somewhere else , i fit in at home			0
i feel like when i try to fit in , it comes across as not genuine , and that is not good			0
" for the time being , though , @entity16 is easing up on showcasing her vocals after suffering a hemorrhaged vocal chord			0
" first day off in forever ... vocal rest and watching movies in with my best friend , " @entity1 tweeted wednesday night			1
" for those of u asking about my voice i screamed too much at my party totally irresponsible but it 's better now , thanks for the well wishes ... i 'll be better in no time			1
" @entity0 's @entity110 and @entity111 contributed to this story			2
