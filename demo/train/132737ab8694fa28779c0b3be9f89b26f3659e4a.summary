-- as @entity1 escalates its invasion of eastern @entity3 and @entity4 convenes this week in @entity5 , the @entity6 , @entity4 , and free nations around the world confront a pivotal moment of truth			1
if the international community , led by the @entity6 , fails to respond in a strong and unified manner to @entity1 's blatant aggression in @entity3 , the ramifications will be both serious and far - reaching			1
by now , it should be clear to all objective observers that @entity18 president @entity17 is not impressed by starkly worded statements and declarations , and if that is the only outcome in @entity5 , it could represent a historic failure of the alliance at a time when @entity4 's foundational purpose has renewed relevance			1
as @entity4 secretary general @entity29 confirmed last week , @entity18 forces have " engaged in direct military operations inside @entity3 , " including firing on @entity3 forces from inside @entity3 itself			1
according to @entity4 , in addition to the @entity18 - backed separatists , there are now more than a thousand @entity18 military forces in @entity3			2
this latest escalation follows @entity18 's illegal annexation of the @entity40 region of @entity3 , as well as months of instigating and perpetuating the crisis in eastern @entity3			1
even after the @entity18 - backed separatists apparently launched a missile that murdered 298 people on @entity44 17 , @entity17 has continued to provide separatists with tanks , armored vehicles , artillery , rocket launchers and anti-aircraft weapons			2
in short , @entity17 has brushed aside @entity6 and @entity52 warnings , as well as initial sanctions , and has invaded eastern @entity3			0
the pre-eminent question now is what will the @entity6 and @entity55 € ” and nations around the world that value democracy , freedom and the rule of lawâ € ” do about it ? in may 2012 , @entity4 governments declared that , " an independent , sovereign and stable @entity3 , firmly committed to democracy and the rule of law , is key to @entity70 - @entity69 security			0
" opinion : " the @entity72 " -- @entity17 's favorite comedy ? in his june 4 speech in @entity75 , president @entity76 said , " our free nations will stand united so that further @entity18 provocations will only mean more isolation and costs for @entity18			0
" as @entity4 declared at the @entity90 , " crises and conflicts beyond @entity4 's borders can pose a direct threat to the security of @entity88 territory and populations			0
" @entity18 's aggression in @entity3 certainly presents a threat to @entity4			1
the @entity93 in @entity5 presents a critical opportunity to build the consensus necessary to back up these declarations with tangible and urgent action			0
this action should include the toughest possible @entity6 and @entity52 sanctions against @entity18 , the provision of much - needed and long - requested weapons to @entity3 , the strengthening of @entity4 's military posture in eastern @entity52 , the sharing of real - time intelligence with @entity105 , as well as robust economic assistance			1
the @entity6 and @entity4 do not need to send combat forces to @entity3			0
the @entity3 people have demonstrated a willingness to fight , and all they have asked for is our support			0
as @entity52 learned at a tremendous cost during @entity113 , weakness and delay in the face of invasion and aggression only invite more aggression			0
thus far , the @entity121 's tepid response to @entity1 's actions in @entity3 has only confirmed @entity17 's view that the @entity6 and @entity52 lack the resolve to stand up to him -- and even worse , he views it as a green light for expanded aggression			1
continued weakness in the face of @entity17 's invasion risks leaving him with the dangerous impression that he can send his " little green men " to @entity4 member nations on @entity18 's periphery			1
such a step by @entity1 would trigger @entity4 's @entity135 commitments and would require a @entity4 military response , as gen. @entity137 , @entity4 's supreme allied commander @entity52 , has reiterated			2
the @entity6 and our @entity4 allies wish we had a well - intentioned partner in @entity1 who follows international law and respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbors			0
despite @entity4 's best efforts to establish friendly and constructive relations with @entity18 since at least 1994 , we clearly do not have a partner in @entity1			2
@entity17 is a bully who wants to prevent the @entity3 people and their legitimately elected government from choosing their own future based on his nostalgia for his days in the @entity156 , his desire to restore @entity18 dominance over its neighbors , and his fear that a democratic , independent and prosperous @entity3 might entice @entity18 to demand more accountability , democracy and prosperity at home			2
the @entity6 and our democratic allies in @entity52 and around the world are not and must not be neutral when a free people and their democratically elected government confront an unprovoked invasion of their sovereign territory			0
opinion : @entity3 's strong argument for military aid @entity173 supreme leader ayatollah @entity172 , @entity174 in @entity175 , the @entity176 in @entity177 , and @entity17 in @entity18 are watching			1
do the @entity6 and @entity4 possess the political will to back up their statements ? the answer to that question will have national security consequences for years to come in @entity52 and around the world .			0

sen. @entity185 : @entity1 's escalation presents a *challenge* for @entity4 leadership
she says starkly worded statements have *n't* *deterred* @entity18 's @entity17
@entity4 needs to ramp up economic sanctions , provide military aid to @entity3
@entity185 : failure to act would invite more aggression
