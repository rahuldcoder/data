-- @entity1 announced an update to @entity3 on monday that will enable users to search for conversation topics within status updates , comments and posts			1
some users with @entity3 can now browse @entity1 for topics of interest â € ” for example , " posts about @entity14 " or simply " @entity14			1
" the update also allows users to search for posts or comments from a certain time period or location ( for example , " posts by my friends from last month " ) or posts that they already composed or commented on			0
the update makes @entity1 much more conducive to real - time conversations , an area where it has been making major strides to compete with the likes of @entity30			1
the two social networks have been competing for eyeballs during primetime television events like the @entity34 , the @entity36 's @entity35 , and sunday 's @entity14 finale			0
when users ' eyes are n't glued to the tv screen , @entity1 and @entity30 want them to be having conversations or voicing their opinions on their respective networks			1
opening up @entity3 to enable post and comment searches will help @entity1 to do so			2
when a user logs into his profile during a primetime event , he can quickly scan all conversations about the game or his favorite show â € ” even if he is n't near the top of the @entity54			2
if a user want to talk about an event hours ( or even days ) later , he can search for all relevant conversations on @entity1 , something users ca n't easily do using @entity30			1
@entity1 has been working to add partnerships around live media in an attempt to fuel this social conversation			0
earlier this month , the social network announced a content deal with @entity65 to promote @entity1 data and conversations alongside live @entity36 and college football broadcasts			1
@entity1 has also added features like searchable hashtags and verified accounts in an attempt to make finding topics of interest easier on the platform			2
@entity1 reported on its @entity77 earnings call that 88 to 100 million people are actively using the social network during primetime television hours â € ” a number that @entity1 advertisers will pay close attention to			2
@entity30 is making similar efforts ahead of the company 's ipo ; the company is expected to file its public ipo papers as soon as this week			0
just last week , @entity30 announced ad partnerships with both @entity90 and the @entity36 , which will bring real - time video into your @entity30 stream			0
@entity1 's search update is not yet available to all @entity3 users , according to a company spokesperson			1
it will be tested starting on monday with a small group of users and will roll out more expansively after that			0
users will only be able to search for content that has been shared with them , in addition to public posts			0
in other words , your conversations should not appear in a search run by someone outside of your network unless your comments and posts are public			0
