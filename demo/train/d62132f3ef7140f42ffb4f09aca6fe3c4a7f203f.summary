@entity0 is synonymous with sultry femininity , and if @entity3 had her way , that would include transgendered women as well			1
fans have petitioned for the transgender burlesque performer and model to join the ranks of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 as @entity0 's newest @entity13			1
the @entity15 petition , which calls @entity16 " a force to be reckoned with , " says such a move by @entity0 would " show the entire community that they embrace trans patrons			1
" the petition has received more than 36,000 signatures , but @entity16 told @entity23 that she has yet to hear from the lingerie company			2
" @entity27 women are a part of the female population and i think that they deserve a respectful representation , " @entity16 said			1
" it would be pretty amazing for @entity0 to be that huge corporation that embraces trans women			1
we shop there as well			0
i can only hope and dream , but i think it 's time			0
and , i meet most of the requirements and have credibility as a model			0
" @entity0 declined to comment			1
before @entity16 became " @entity44 , " she was @entity3 from @entity45			1
she first garnered fame on @entity47 of " @entity48 " on the @entity50 network			2
she began her transition to a woman after the show wrapped , and has since been signed by @entity54 , appeared on " @entity56 " and in @entity55 , and worked with famed photographer @entity57 on a film			0
for five seasons " @entity48 " has demystified drag queens and redefined a standard of beauty			1
" @entity48 " executive producer @entity62 told @entity23 , " the first face of @entity65 @entity64 was @entity66 , ( who ) was a pioneer for drag performers			1
now it 's @entity3 's chance to break the ' beauty barrier ' for trans people			1
" while the @entity74 community has made some strides around the nation , @entity16 said she still comes across many people who simply do n't understand the transgender community			1
" for a long time trans people have always been a joke			0
our reputation has always been the bottom of the barrel and it 's not fair , " she said			0
@entity16 confessed that her transition to a woman was both a physical and emotional uphill battle			2
" i run into a lot of ignorance and stupidity , " @entity16 said			2
" it gets really frustrating , but you have to take yourself out of it and realize what 's happening in the bigger picture			0
a lot of people are still uncomfortable with this idea , i do n't know why			0
i think most of the country and the world have n't gotten to know trans people			0
if you do n't know me , get to know me			0
i 'm open , honest and genuine			0
" " it 's difficult for people ( who ) do n't know trans men and women to wrap their head around the whole thing , " @entity62 said			1
" that 's why it 's so important that more trans people have a chance to tell their stories and , as is the case with @entity44 , to give a face ... to the trans movement			2
" model and designer @entity118 was the first trans woman to compete on " @entity121 , " and said that while the petitioners ' hearts might be in the right place , the petition itself might not be the best approach			0
" i do n't want any special treatment because i 'm trans unless there 's a particular role made for it			2
i want my legacy to be that i was hard - working and good at what i did , " @entity118 said , " should @entity0 have a trans model ? sure , why not			2
but should they be pressured into hiring one ? no , i do n't think it 's fair			0
" @entity118 is n't offended that the lingerie company does n't have a trans model			0
she knows firsthand how difficult it is for any woman to land a spot in the elite group of @entity0 models			2
" if trans people are going to make any strides in society it should n't be forced , but if anyone can make it as a @entity0 model it 's @entity44			1
she 's beautiful and just did a runway show with @entity156 and was amazing , " @entity118 said			0
while @entity16 did n't join the @entity157 for the @entity0 runway show in @entity159 on november 13 , she said she has the love and support from those that matter most : her family , friends and fans			1
" i have an education , stepdaughter and go to @entity170 meetings			0
i live my life as a woman does in this country , " @entity16 said , " that 's what people need to know			2
" if @entity16 ever does become an @entity13 , @entity62 said she would bring @entity66 's trademark charisma , uniqueness , nerve and talent to @entity0 , and thinks she 's on the right path			1
but , if he had to give any advice he would say , " to quote @entity66 : i have one thing to say			0
you better work ! " do you think @entity0 should hire @entity3 ? share your thoughts in the comments .			1
