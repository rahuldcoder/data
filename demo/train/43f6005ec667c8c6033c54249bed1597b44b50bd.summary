@entity0 , @entity1 -- the skies may have cleared , but an assessment of damage has only just begun			1
officials from president @entity8 's administration will travel tuesday to @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity1 -- some of the hardest - hit states -- to survey ongoing response efforts , according to the @entity14			1
the storm known as @entity16 left parts of the @entity19 @entity18 grappling with dangerous floodwaters and widespread power outages			1
at least 27 deaths in nine states have been blamed on @entity16 , which fizzled to a post-tropical cyclone and headed over eastern @entity26 monday			1
flooding was ongoing , particularly in @entity28 , said @entity29 , director of the @entity30			1
@entity31 , @entity32 and @entity1 endured some of the worst flooding			1
" a lot of the activities are moving into recovery phases , but we are still very concerned about the flooding , " @entity29 told reporters monday			2
southern states were affected primarily by power outages and the effects of the storm surge , particularly on the @entity45 of @entity10 , where @entity46 had been chopped into pieces in several places by the pounding surf			2
as of monday afternoon , about 5 million customers were without power , @entity29 said , citing figures from the @entity53			1
that was down from about 6 million earlier , he said			2
in @entity56 , torrential rains washed out roads and bridges , flooding homes and some businesses			1
the town of @entity62 was struck particularly hard			2
in @entity1 , the governor warned that further flooding and loss of life are likely for the small , rural state			1
while small brooks have crested , large rivers have not , he said			0
" it 's just devastating , " gov. @entity70 said			2
" @entity73 communities under water , businesses , homes , obviously roads and bridges , rail transportation infrastructure			0
we 've lost farmers ' crops			0
we 're tough folks up here but @entity16 ... really hit us hard			1
" @entity83 , a hydrologist for the @entity84 in charge of the @entity87 forecast center in @entity88 , @entity89 , said rainfall reached 15 inches in some places			0
the fact that much of the affected area was already heavily saturated by rainfall in the weeks prior to @entity16 made things worse , he said			0
moderate to major flooding was occurring from @entity56 into the @entity98 , through much of northern @entity99 " and a good chunk of @entity1			1
" many of the river crests set records , he said			0
an array of rivers and creeks eclipsed flood stages and continued to rise monday			0
" we 're seeing record flooding levels across the northern part of our state			0
nine river locations have reached or passed record flooding levels , " @entity32 gov. @entity112 told reporters			1
asked how @entity30 has changed its approach to handling disasters six years after @entity118 laid waste to much of the @entity120 , @entity29 said the agency now has more authority to act prior to receiving a request from a governor			1
that translates into " not having to wait " until the impact of the storm is clear			0
" we have to act quickly and be prepared to support that , " he said			0
in @entity129 , @entity8 vowed , " we will make sure folks have all the support they need			2
" he added that " it will take time " to recover			0
residents from @entity10 through @entity28 will need that support , with homes , businesses , roads and bridges torn apart by floodwaters			0
some of the worst flooding since 1927 ravaged @entity1 's normally tranquil countryside , turning babbling brooks into turbulent rivers and knocking homes from their foundations			1
in @entity147 , @entity1 , a young woman who had been standing near a river was swept away by the water			2
her body was recovered monday			0
one person is still missing in @entity1 and feared dead , authorities said			2
in all , 260 roads were affected , many of them underwater , @entity1 's @entity30 said monday			1
the emergency management headquarters flooded overnight and was evacuated and relocated from @entity157 to @entity158 , approximately 20 miles away			0
" we never see this sort of thing in @entity1 , " said @entity159 of @entity160 , where a covered bridge was flooded			2
" for the people who are saying that @entity16 was disappointing , maybe , because they did n't get the sort of wind and damage they expected , i just want to remind them that , in places like @entity1 , we really got it pretty hard			1
" in @entity10 , about 250,000 customers were without power monday , down from more than 440,000 on sunday night , the state 's division of emergency management said			1
@entity177 reported monday evening that an estimated half million people had no power			1
some customers might have to wait a week or more because of damage to the system			0
but life along much of the @entity18 returned to normal , as subway services resumed on all 22 lines in @entity56 , and the three major airports in the area reopened after thousands of flights were canceled over the weekend			2
flight schedules were expected to normalize slowly , and passengers were urged to check with their airlines before going to the airport			0
@entity193 canceled many trains , but had some service in the @entity196			0
officials reported six deaths in @entity10 , four in @entity9 , five in @entity199 , three each in @entity56 and @entity1 , two each in @entity98 and @entity32 and one each in @entity201 and @entity202			1
the @entity19 government estimates that the cost from wind damage alone will exceed $ 1 billion			0
analysts have put the total anticipated cost of @entity16 much higher			0
@entity2 's @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 contributed to this report .			0
