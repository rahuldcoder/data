@entity189 , meanwhile , has put forth its own draft , which " strongly urges all parties in @entity10 to cease immediately all armed violence in all its forms			1

at the @entity205 , @entity236 ambassador @entity235 said wednesday 's events in @entity19 " underline as clearly as never before that the @entity201 now has to act			1
it has to send out a strong signal to the @entity10 regime to stop the use of heavy weapons			1
we want to give the @entity204 plan , which we all support in the council , some teeth -- and that 's why we should adopt a resolution with the sanctions threat			0
" in @entity250 , @entity8 , @entity249 said the situation in @entity10 is nearing an all - out civil war			1
" in other words , it 's getting very , very messy , " he said			0

it could suggest that " the regime itself is crumbling , " said @entity273 , an analyst with @entity274 , a think tank focusing on international affairs			0
events in @entity10 show " a real escalation in fighting , " said @entity137 defense secretary @entity279			1
it " tells us that this is a situation that is rapidly spinning out of control , and for that reason it 's extremely important that the international community , working with other countries that have concerns in that area , have to bring maximum pressure on @entity4 to do what 's right , and to step down and to allow for that peaceful transition , " @entity279 said			0
the @entity137 government announced wednesday a new round of sanctions against members of the @entity10 government			1

@entity29 , one of those killed wednesday , was a member of the country 's minority @entity317			1
who was named by the @entity321 in sanctions this year			0
@entity137 citizens were prohibited from engaging in transactions with him and other officials amid what the @entity137 government called @entity10 's " continued use of violence against its people			1
" in 2006 , the @entity321 named @entity332 -- then @entity10 's director of military intelligence -- in an executive order , freezing his assets and prohibiting @entity137 citizens from engaging in transactions with him			2
at the time , the @entity137 government called @entity332 " a key architect of @entity10 's domination of @entity339 , as well as a fundamental contributor to @entity10 's long - standing policy to foment terrorism against @entity343			2
" what we need to know about @entity10 days ago , @entity346 , the former @entity10 ambassador to @entity348 who has become the country 's highest - level diplomatic defector , told @entity0 that @entity332 had run an @entity351 in @entity348 training camp			2
a @entity137 official said @entity346 ' claim was " broadly consistent with our understanding " of the @entity10 regime 's cooperation with @entity351 " elements			1
" but the @entity10 regime has repeatedly denied involvement in terrorist activities -- and has blamed the violence of the past 16 months on " armed terrorist groups			2
" dark images of horror and despair smuggled out of @entity10 @entity10 's @entity351 boomerang since the crisis began in march 2011 , the @entity205 estimates , more than 10,000 people have been killed in the violence ; the opposition @entity23 estimates that more than 16,000 have died			1
