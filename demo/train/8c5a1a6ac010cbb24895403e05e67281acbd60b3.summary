-- during a recent visit to @entity2 , a woman on a bus in @entity5 expressed puzzlement to me about why anyone would choose to travel to her country right now			1
after a lengthy description of the violence in her hometown of @entity15 , she left me with emphatic advice : " no confia en nadie , " meaning " trust no one			1
" that advice seems extreme			2
with a well - developed tourism sector , there are legions of people whose livelihood depends on helping you have a good time , and beyond that , most locals are warm and friendly			2
the drug violence that grabs most of the headlines should n't define a country so rich in world - class attractions			1
yet safety should always be taken into account			2
the @entity33 warns against travel to many @entity2 states , mostly in the north and west			1
though southern @entity2 goes about business as usual ( and the @entity33 does not warn against travel to the area ) , it 's important to exercise caution and remember that danger can arise anywhere			1
i 've visited @entity2 three times and have got a lot more to see , but here are three undeniably good reasons i 've discovered to visit @entity2 : @entity50 : fried grasshoppers , perhaps ? @entity2 food as a category needs little introduction ; it was even recognized by @entity55 as part of world heritage in 2010			1
@entity60 in southwestern @entity2 is famous for multiple moles , complex stewed sauces served over meats			1
the @entity64 treatment of the tortilla is the tlayuda , an open , crispy tortilla slathered with a bean paste , topped with cheese , meat or other toppings			2
more adventurous @entity64 offerings are the famous chapulines , grasshoppers fried to a crunch and spiced with chile and lime			2
they are better than they might sound ( unless you 're wise enough to realize that anything crunchy with chile and lime is going to be good )			2
@entity83 originated in @entity2 , and they still make it best			1
@entity60 is ground zero for chocoholics , where chocolate shops show visitors the transformation from beans into bars in the store			0
chocolate here is most popular as a hot drink with water served alongside a sweet roll , but you can get it with milk or in bar form			0
coastal cities such as @entity101 or @entity5 on the @entity102 have great seafood , notably ceviche			0
@entity2 ceviche usually adds tomato to the citrus marinated fish and shrimp			1
also often added is ketchup , though this usually is called coctel instead of ceviche			0
( the tomatoes are acceptable , the ketchup is an abomination )			0
the @entity114 has specialties ranging from cochinita pibil ( citrus marinated roast pork ) to pavo en salsa negra ( turkey in black salsa , a seriously funky dish made with burned chilies )			1
you can get a pretty mean taco almost anywhere			0
@entity2 tacos are usually soft corn tortillas , a small pile of meat and little pickled vegetable or onion			1
salsa is around , but you have to add it yourself if you want it			0
the ends of many worlds @entity2 's many pre-hispanic sites are among the country 's most interesting destinations			1
they carried extra weight last year for eschatologists with 2012 being the end of a cycle in one of the @entity147 long - count calendars			0
the @entity148 never said it was the " end of the world , " just the end of " a " world			0
so they will be there for you to enjoy in the new 14th baktun			0
archaeologists are n't sure who built the massive pyramids at @entity159 , but the site was long abandoned by the time the @entity161 were dominant ( they reckoned it was built by gods )			1
it is easily reachable from @entity164 but as such can be crowded and is packed with vendors			0
near the city of @entity60 , the hilltop ruins of @entity167 were once home to the @entity170			0
@entity171 , a @entity147 site in a lush jungle in @entity174 , is also extremely impressive and interesting , but it is in the interior of the country and not really easy to get to from anywhere			1
the site 's jungle seclusion gives a trip there a more adventurous feel			1
expect to pay extra at these sites if you want to shoot video or use a tripod			0
fees are posted near the entrances			0
it will likely be hot ( in the summer especially ) , but vendors inside and out of the parks offer drinks as well as a vast array of trinkets , ranging from respectable to ridiculous			0
mysterious swims @entity2 's beaches are plentiful , varied and justifiably a major draw			1
this year , i went for the more sedate environs of @entity201 , a nice uncrowded beach with perfect turquoise water ( and a beachside @entity147 ruin )			0
but the cenotes are much more unusual and interesting			0
cenotes are a geological occurrence that are found in the @entity114 and very few other places			1
because most of the peninsula sits on a limestone shelf , there are no surface rivers , and rainwater quickly seeps underground where it gathers and forms subterranean bodies of water known as cenotes			2
they are present throughout the @entity114 and some have been developed into near - theme parks , where you pay a substantial admission price and there are vehicles , boats , zip lines and more			1
others are tiny sinkholes known mainly to locals and are free if you can find them			0
many fall somewhere in between with a small admission fee ( equivalent of $ 5 - $ 10 ) , perhaps a changing area and maybe some lights or ropes			0
other than that , it 's just a natural swimming hole			1
some go underground for hundreds of meters or more , and they are a popular attraction for intermediate divers			2
they 're also perfect for just plain swimming			2
the @entity114 is hot and sticky ; the water in cenotes is fresh and ice cold since they are partially or completely underground			1
in some cases , sunlight shines through holes in the cavern ceiling , illuminating the beautifully clear , blue - tinted water giving it an otherworldly feel			1
and many cenotes attract swallows , which you might -- as i did -- mistake for bats			0
they constantly fly in and out squeaking busily			0
though the clear water might trick your brain into thinking you 're in a sterile pool , you are not			0
there is wildlife present , mostly in the form of little fish that will nibble at your feet if you are still , as well as the occasional turtle or snake			0
some recommended cenotes for swimming : @entity272 near @entity273 is a beautiful underground spot			1
cristalino off the main highway near @entity277 is mostly exposed and has a fun cliff you can jump off ( it 's only a 15 foot or so drop )			2
@entity280 near @entity201 has some exposed and some subterranean areas and lots of wildlife running or swimming around			2
so whether you go to @entity2 for cave swimming and ancient sites or for mole and margaritas , it 'll be worth it			1
@entity291 en mi -- trust me on that .			0

beauty of @entity2 should n't be overlooked because of violence , author argues
the country 's *distinctive* regional *cuisine* and ancient past are undeniably alluring
for otherworldly relaxation , underground swimming holes await in the @entity114
