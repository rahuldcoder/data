editor 's note : @entity2 worked as a staffer for former house speaker @entity4 and other @entity5 in @entity6			1
he is president of @entity7 , a @entity8 - based advocacy firm that has represented clients including the @entity10 , @entity11 and the @entity12			2
he formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the @entity13			0
@entity2 says @entity15 's victory gives @entity16 a dominant position in @entity8 ( @entity18 ) -- the metric system is the kind of thing that you can expect from the 60 - vote filibuster - proof majority democrats now have in the @entity24			1
after the @entity25 in 1974 , @entity16 trounced republicans in the mid-term elections , getting 61 seats in the @entity24 and 291 in the @entity29			1
in the @entity24 , they adjusted the rules to make it harder for @entity5 to filibuster ( reducing the magic number from 67 to 60 to invoke cloture , which ends debate )			2
in the @entity29 , they passed all kinds of reforms to take power away from senior members and give it to junior members			0
and @entity6 mandated that the @entity41 people embrace the metric system			1
the metric system idea never really caught on , and although the pain of @entity25 afflicted @entity5 for another two elections , they eventually pulled themselves out of their deep hole , with some good ideas and a charismatic leader , who promised to restore @entity41 to greatness			1
@entity16 have once again reached the magic number of 60 , as @entity52 finally threw in the towel against the one - time joke writer for @entity55 , @entity15			1
@entity5 have little reason to laugh , though , as they look at their diminished ranks and wonder how they have put themselves in such a weakened position			0
it was only four - and - a - half years ago that the @entity5 was on the top of the world , and some of their more smug strategists were confidently predicting a permanent @entity5 majority			0
this is a good time for such self - reflection			0
republicans lost three top - notch senators in the last election -- @entity52 , @entity69 and @entity70 -- who lost not because they were bad senators , or because they had scandals , or because they had lost touch with constituents			0
all three lost because they were @entity5			0
in other words , the brand killed them			0
and if you look at the latest polls , the @entity5 brand has n't gotten any better in the last six months			0
in fact , according to @entity81 , even 38 percent of @entity5 have a negative view of the @entity5			0
but let 's not throw in the towel yet , my @entity5 friends			0
just as in the mid- 1970s , when @entity90 overreach led to a @entity5 resurgence , the house that @entity15 has built will inevitably collapse on its own leftward - self			1
a new @entity81 poll shows that the @entity41 people are starting to catch on that @entity16 are pushing the country to a place that it does n't want to go			1
the poll " finds a statistically significant increase since last year in the percentage of @entity41 who describe the @entity90 's views as being " too liberal , " from 39 percent to 46 percent			1
this is the largest percentage saying so since november 1994 , after the party 's losses in that year 's midterm elections			0
" it is no surprise that @entity41 would have that impression of @entity16 in the @entity29 and in @entity6			1
when they passed a so - called stimulus bill that @entity5 branded as pork - filled , they lost their credibility on fiscal responsibility			0
when the president assumed control over @entity114 , dictated terms to @entity116 , and then refused to allow some banks to pay back their @entity119 loans , independent voters grew nervous about the government 's stepped - up intervention in the private sector			1
and last week , when @entity16 passed a climate change bill that @entity5 insist will sharply raise energy prices for middle - class families , moderate @entity16 started to jump ship			1
in fact , 44 @entity16 defied intense pressure from house speaker @entity130 , and voted no. democrats are now making plans to intervene in the health care marketplace , with some liberals insisting on a government - run " public option " health insurer			1
in any event , many wo n't be satisfied until the government basically sets prices for health insurance and prescription drugs			0
the arrival of the man from @entity145 will make the @entity16 move even more to the left			2
he will not only be one more vote for the left , but one more loud voice for liberal policies			2
because of his celebrity status , he will attract media attention , and because of his philosophy , he will use that attention to move @entity16 further left			0
when @entity15 first started in politics , he did so as the liberal answer to @entity158			2
imagine if @entity158 were the 60th vote for @entity5 , with @entity160 as president			1
now , think how @entity15 will act as the 60th vote for president @entity163			1
yes , @entity16 will move left by more than a few kilometers , but they will do so at their own peril			0
another poll showed that while 40 percent of @entity41 identify themselves as conservative , only 21 percent think of themselves as liberal			2
the @entity41 people voted for change			2
they did n't vote for a liberal orthodoxy that promises more government , higher taxes , slower growth , more pork and a liberal social agenda			2
in 1975 , the newly dominant @entity90 @entity6 sent president @entity176 a bill that declared that @entity41 was going to be metric , which he signed			1
when @entity178 became president two years later , he signed a law that told @entity41 that they could n't drive faster than 55 mph			0
these measures made perfect sense to the liberal sensibilities of the time			0
but they did n't make sense to the @entity41 people , and are symbols of a philosophy that was out of touch with the people in the 1970s and is still out of touch with the lives of most @entity41 today			2
most @entity41 still do n't use the metric system , and most certainly do n't stick to the 55 mile an hour speed limit on the highways of @entity41			1
and while they may still like @entity163 and still laugh at jokes written by @entity15 , they will eventually grow weary of the newly dominant liberals who now run @entity8			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity200 : with @entity15 as 60th vote in @entity24 , liberals dominant in @entity8
he says liberal control in 1970s led to bill to convert @entity41 to metric system
@entity2 says @entity16 are overreaching and will lose public 's support
he says voters wanted change but not bigger government
