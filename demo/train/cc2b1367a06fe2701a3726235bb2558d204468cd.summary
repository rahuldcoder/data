the nation 's top tax collector resigned wednesday amid controversy over @entity4 targeting of conservative groups that applied for federal tax - exempt status			1
the official , acting @entity4 commissioner @entity7 , was aware employees were targeting conservative groups in may 2012 , according to the agency			1
but @entity7 , then the agency 's deputy commissioner , did n't tell @entity13 about it when he testified before an oversight committee in july -- despite being questioned on the issue			0
he was named acting commissioner in november			1
an administration official told @entity18 on thursday that @entity19 will appoint a new acting commissioner this week			1
announcing the resignation to reporters wednesday , president @entity19 said the agency 's misconduct was " inexcusable			1
" read the @entity4 @entity26 report " @entity27 have a right to be angry about it , and i 'm angry about it , " @entity19 said			1
" it should not matter what political stripe you 're from			0
the fact of the matter is , the @entity4 has to operate with absolute integrity , " the president said			1
@entity19 pledged to work " hand in hand " with @entity13 as it investigates the matter , and vowed new safeguards will be put in place at the @entity4 so that " this does n't happen again			1
" despite his resignation , @entity7 is expected to testify friday at a hearing before the @entity46 , according to a source familiar with the proceedings			1
read the resignation letter in an internal message to @entity4 employees obtained by @entity18 , @entity7 said he would be stepping down as commissioner in early june			1
" this has been an incredibly difficult time for the @entity4 given the events of the past few days , and there is a strong and immediate need to restore public trust in the nation 's tax agency , " @entity7 wrote			1
opinion : with @entity4 defanged , politics can run rampant ' @entity64 ' employees news of @entity7 's resignation followed revelations that the @entity4 has identified two " rogue " employees in the agency 's @entity71 office as being principally responsible for the " overly aggressive " handling of requests by conservative groups for tax - exempt status , a congressional source told @entity18			1
@entity7 said the staffers have already been disciplined , according to another source familiar with @entity7 's discussions with congressional investigators			1
the second source said @entity7 emphasized that the problem with @entity4 handling of tax - exempt status for tea party groups was not limited to these two employees			1
@entity7 met with @entity89 chairman @entity88 of @entity90 on tuesday to discuss an appearance before @entity13			0
asked wednesday in a @entity89 hallway about his meeting with @entity7 , @entity88 told @entity18 , " i did not learn as much from the meeting as i would have liked			0
" " i told him that it was in his best interest to be totally cooperative -- that it 's often the cover - up that causes more problems than the original malfeasance , " the senator said			0
" and just to be totally straight with me and everybody , and he said he would			0
" meanwhile , @entity103 congressional leaders on wednesday accused @entity19 's administration of potentially criminal behavior in the handling of requests for tax - exempt status from conservative groups			1
@entity110 leader @entity110 suggested criminal behavior had occurred , saying that the " very serious " allegations involve " an effort to bring the power of the federal government to bear on those the administration disagreed with in the middle of a heated national election			0
" " it actually could be , could be criminal and we are determined to get the answers , " @entity119 said			0
house speaker @entity123 was more definitive			0
" my question is , who 's going to jail over this scandal ? " he asked			0
@entity123 told reporters that " clearly someone violated the law " in what an @entity4 inspector general 's report described as delayed processing of applications by groups associated with the political right wing			1
opinion : the real risk of the @entity4 scandal multiple investigations @entity27 attorney general @entity142 , who ordered a criminal investigation into the situation , said wednesday at a congressional hearing that investigators will look at the conduct of @entity4 offices nationwide			1
" the facts will take us where ever they take us , " he said			0
@entity142 said the investigation will also examine whether @entity4 officials lied to @entity13 about the singling out of conservative groups			1
while the allegations originated in the @entity71 office , the @entity157 inquiry is based out of @entity160 , @entity142 said			0
the comments came as all 45 @entity162 sent the @entity163 a letter that called for the administration to " comply with all requests related to congressional inquiries without any delay " involving the controversy			0
the letter called the scandal " yet another completely inexcusable attempt to chill the speech of political opponents and those who would question their government , consistent with a broader pattern of intimidation by arms of your administration to silence political dissent			0
" the clearly coordinated attacks were part of a @entity103 effort to increase pressure on the @entity19 administration over the controversy , one of three potential scandals that has the @entity163 on the defensive less than four months into the president 's second term			1
according to the report by the agency 's inspector general released tuesday , the @entity4 developed and followed a faulty policy to determine whether the applicants were engaged in political activities , which would disqualify the groups from receiving tax - exempt status			2
the controversial move began in early 2010 and continued for more than 18 months , the report said , declaring that " the @entity4 used inappropriate criteria that identified for review @entity203 and other organizations applying for tax - exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention			2
" @entity4 officials , according to the report , did not consult anyone beyond the agency about the development of the additional screening criteria			2
they believed that the criteria they came up with were a screening shortcut meant to help with the influx of applications , the report said			0
will the scandal affect 2014 elections ? the controversial actions began after the 2010 @entity227 ruling in the @entity229 case that greatly expanded the ability of corporations , unions and other organizations to participate in election spending , though not through direct contributions to candidates or parties			0
after the ruling , the number of politically oriented groups seeking tax exempt status as social welfare organizations under section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) of the federal tax code increased greatly at a time when the federal government , including the @entity4 , was dealing with austerity measures that reduced or stagnated personnel and resources			2
the @entity4 ' top watchdog found that the criteria used to flag potential political applications resulted in substantial delays and the request of unnecessary information from the groups			2
' be on the @entity258 ' among the criteria used by @entity4 officials to flag applications was a " @entity262 " list , which was discontinued in 2012 , according to the report			2
the criteria included : -- whether " @entity203 , " " @entity265 " or " @entity266 " was referenced in the case file			0
-- whether the issues outlined in the application included government spending , government debt or taxes			0
-- whether there was advocating or lobbying to " make @entity27 a better place to live			2
" -- whether a statement in the case file criticized how the country is being run			0
-- whether it advocated education about the @entity280 and the @entity281			0
the investigation by the treasury inspector general for tax administration was initiated after congressional complaints began to surface in the media in 2012 that the @entity4 was targeting conservative groups and holding up applications			1
@entity19 struggles with rocky start to second term " whether the inappropriate criterion was shorthand for all potential political cases or not , developing and using criteria that focuses on organization names and policy positions instead of the activities permitted under the treasury regulations does not promote public confidence that tax - exempt laws are being adhered to impartially , " the report said			2
the @entity4 welcomed the report , saying that it agreed that aspects of its original approach in handling the influx of tax - exempt applications was inappropriate			2
" the @entity4 is required by law to determine if organizations are engaging in a legally permissible level of political activity			2
centralizing these cases was necessary to achieve consistent treatment , " it said in a statement			0
inefficient management in a written response included in the report , the @entity4 commissioner of the @entity314 said there was no criminal behavior behind the actions of the agents , but rather inefficient management			1
@entity4 in the spotlight : what 's a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) ? " we believe the front - line career employees that made the decisions acted out of a desire for efficiency and not out of any political and partisan viewpoint , " the commissioner wrote			1
the report 's findings indicate that of the 298 cases reviewed by the @entity4 inspector general as potential political cases not eligible for tax exempt status : 72 contained the name " tea party , " 11 contained " 9/12 " and 13 contained the word " patriots , " according to the report			2
there were 202 cases that did not contain any such reference			0
of those applications still open for review , 160 cases were open from 206 days to more than three years -- through two election cycles			0
among the recommendations made by the @entity351 inspector general : the @entity4 must better document reasons why applications are chosen for review , develop a process to track requests for assistance , develop and provide training to employees before each election cycle and immediately resolve outstanding cases			1
the report also called on @entity351 to develop guidelines to explain social welfare activity -- the primary factor in obtaining tax - exempt status .			0
