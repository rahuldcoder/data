-- it 's a beautiful day to be on the water a few kilometers off the southern coast of @entity4			2
within view of shore the spinner dolphins twist and turn energetically , flying fish launch out of the water and cruise for what seems like ages , and a manta ray gracefully glides under my boat			2
in the safety of my 20 - foot research boat			2
i am the biggest thing on the water			0
suddenly , a blue whale emerges close by , and as it breaks the surface , it exhales			1
this creature is so immense that the vertical tower of mist that escapes from its blowholes is taller than my boat is long			0
as it calmly swims , it teases me by revealing just parts of its huge self			0
it is hard to fathom just how large this creature truly is			0
i am mesmerized by the scene , impressed at how the buoyancy of the ocean has aided this giant to achieve near maximum size			0
my moment is disrupted when i become aware of the fleet of container ships close by			1
each carries thousands of containers , which are on average twice the length of my boat			0
welcome to one of the busiest shipping highways in the world			0
what i see is no different from what i hear when i drop my hydrophone ( underwater microphone ) in the water			0
the cacophony of the ships ' propellers drowns out all other sounds in the ocean before , during and often even after we have lost view of them in the distance			0
these ocean - going monsters are at the beck and call of human needs and their increasing numbers are a reflection of the escalating wants of an ever - growing global population			1
this morning 's lesson has been about perspective but i soon realize there are many more lessons to be learned			0
moments like these concretize my desire to scientifically understand these whales in order to protect them			2
moments like these drive me to work harder			0
over the years , my research has shown that these whales are different , unorthodox even			2
@entity78 has often described baleen whales ( the group that blue whales belong to ) as creatures of habit			1
they travel to the poles to feed and then migrate to the lower latitudes to mate and calve			0
but we find that quite incredibly , those within the @entity88 choose to remain in tropical waters year - round			1
these blue whales grow up to 24 meters ( 78.7 feet ) and have incredible energetic requirements so it makes sense for them to exploit the most productive areas of the ocean to ensure their survival			1
but these waters are often considered less productive than their temperate or polar counterparts , and this anomalous behavior leads me to question why ? how ? the @entity88 clearly holds many secrets that we have yet to unravel			1
what excites me most is that the waters around @entity4 , slap - bang in the heart of the @entity88 , are home to a resident group of @entity110 blues			1
my research is just beginning to shed light on what sustains this group of the largest animals to ever roam the oceans throughout the year			2
but besides fulfilling their nutritional needs , @entity4 waters provide a safe haven for mothers and calves and have given me the opportunity to observe mesmerizing portrayals of the persistence of males and the pickiness of females engaged in courtship rituals			2
the @entity110 is as unorthodox as the blue whales that live within it			1
it is the only ocean that is not connected from the @entity132 right through to the @entity133			0
the effects of this geographic isolation are profound , and the differences these blue whales display may be driven in part by this			1
unfortunately , this isolation and their dependence on a restricted area for their most fundamental needs -- feeding , breeding and calving makes these blue whales increasingly vulnerable to threats			1
very little is known about the causes of natural mortality for blue whales			1
they are after all , very large			0
however , human - induced threats abound			0
not least , off the south coast of @entity4			0
sadly , the overlap between prime blue whale habitat and extremely busy shipping lanes increases the risk of mortality by ship strike			1
blue whales do not belong wrapped on the bow of a container ship			1
they belong swimming freely in the ocean			0
available data tells us that commercial shipping densities off the southern coast of @entity4 are double those in @entity174 's @entity173 where measures are already being taken to mitigate the risk of collisions with blue whales			1
my mission is to decrease whale mortality by ship strike in the waters off @entity4 with the support of a strong network of scientists from around the world			1
but to achieve this mission , i realize i have to be an unorthodox scientist			2
i have to ensure that people , not just scientists know of the problems faced by this population			2
i believe that the more we know , the more we care and the more we feel responsible and subsequently , the greater our chance of success			0
my dream is to work to protect these whales as best i can to ensure that the immense blue whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling of the @entity199 since 1894 is not the only option for seeing blue whales in the future			1

@entity207 : northern @entity88 is home to *unusual* population of blue whales
she says they choose to stay in tropical waters all year round
whales are *threatened* by heavy container ship *traffic* lanes , she says
@entity219 : my mission is to decrease blue whale deaths caused by ship strikes
