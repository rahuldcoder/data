-- we 're often told that sharing our feelings could save our relationships from sliding into emotional breakdowns -- perhaps talking it out could also shield us from the traveling blues too			0
a group of @entity9 transport and technology experts has come together to create a new digital platform that would map the emotions of people using different types of public transport in real time in the hope of improving daily journeys			1
whether it 'd be gridlock traffic , delayed buses and jam - packed trains -- or even a stress - free and smooth trip -- the goal is for passengers to be able to use a bespoke app to say how they feel about their travel , make suggestions , highlight disruptions and see what other travelers say			2
the plan is to combine this data with information collected from various social media channels , like geolocated tweets , to build an intelligent tool that would offer live feedback about all kinds of journeys in different locations			1
ultimately , developers say , the aim is to use a number of sources , including weather data or information about events , to help bus and rail customers plan their journeys better and save their money and time -- and frayed nerves too			2
" being able to distil useful , actionable information from a large amount of data -- it 's extremely exciting , " says @entity56 , co-founder of @entity57 , a @entity9 - based social enterprise startup working on the project			1
" it really puts passengers right at the center of the operation of existing services and the development of new ones -- not just in the sort of traditional customer service sense , but actually having customer - led services which are being responded to in real time			0
" know your customers the developers say the " sentiment mapping " project would also provide transport operators with a better understanding about the needs of their passengers and enable them to respond better in emergencies			1
but more importantly , they say , it would help providers to devise more effective future strategies and make bigger decision about infrastructure investments			0
" what would emerge from that analysis is extra information that would allow people to develop a long term plan , " says @entity88 , research leader at the @entity89 in @entity90 , who is also working on the project			2
" in five or 10 years ' time , i think people will look back at transport providers -- rail , bus , maybe road services as well -- and say how could you possibly run a business without knowing what your customers were doing and thinking ? " smart transport while the project is still in its infancy , the team unveiled thursday morning a live tool mapping passengers ' sentiment based on @entity112			1
covering the area between @entity90 and @entity115 , the visualization uses a mixture of glowing green and red blobs of different sizes to showcase the sentiments of the train , bus and tube passengers traveling through the region			0
every few seconds , tweets located in place pop up to unveil messages such as , " ridiculously hot in the tube this morning , " or " my bus is 15 minutes late			0
" the " demonstrator " went live at the opening of a @entity9 government - backed innovation center aimed at exploring how to use emerging technologies to improve future transport systems			1
based in @entity115 , the @entity137 's space will bring together innovators , research and entrepreneurs to trial and develop smart mobility solutions ranging from sentiment mapping and driverless vehicles , intelligent traffic lights and improved airport data systems " this is about how to improve journeys in the future , " says @entity147 , a spokesperson for the @entity148			1
" the way you get from a to @entity154 often involves loads of different methods of transport -- you might walk , take the bus , train , bicycle ; how do you make all those different modes of transport more connected , how do we use emerging technologies like @entity165 , satellite technology , mobile phones , open data or sentiment mapping and how do we use these technologies to improve transport systems			1
" looking ahead , @entity56 says the sentiment mapping team is now in talks with interested parties about taking the project forward and potentially developing an early - stage tool within the next months			2
" what 's really interesting and exciting is the opportunity for technology to empower citizens to have a more effective voice in the way cities develop around them to meet their needs , " says @entity56			0
" smart cities need smart citizens in order to be effective			0

a @entity9 team is creating a new platform for mapping people 's journey sentiments
the goal is to combine social media data with other sources to improve *commuting*
project developers say it would help transport operators understand passengers ' needs
