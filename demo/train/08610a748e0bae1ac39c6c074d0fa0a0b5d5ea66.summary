for more than a year the @entity1 government has been bombing and spreading terror in the country 's @entity4 state , surgically cleansing the land of the @entity8 people			1
the government of @entity10 argues it is fighting a rebellion led by the @entity12 that engineered the secession of @entity10			1
@entity14 still struggles to stomach the victory of the @entity16 , brought about partly by the large number of @entity8 fighters who -- after decades of marginalization and political exclusion -- joined forces with the @entity22			1
accordingly , @entity14 treats the @entity8 people as the enemy within -- a foe whose independent spirit has never been tamed the cost : half a million people have been displaced or severely affected by the conflict , according to the @entity31 's @entity30 office			1
the most recent rash of bombings is the second time in 20 years that the @entity8 people have been targets of the same @entity14 leaders -- president @entity37 and governor @entity38			1
both men are internationally indicted war criminals , although both deny the charges			2

i traveled to @entity10 bear witness , as a journalist and a @entity54 , to a people under siege , at the war - torn border between the two @entity59 , one of the most isolated regions on earth			1
smuggled into the @entity63 , an area closed to the world , i filmed local activists documenting the attacks being perpetrated by the @entity14 regime			0
despite being bombed several times a day since june 2011 , the activists remain nonviolent			1
armed with cameras and the hope for a better tomorrow , they relentlessly scour their homeland collecting the testimonies , pictures and evidence to build up a case against their aggressors : their government			2
our team traveled to a number of villages up to 20 km from the front line			0
during my time in the region i experienced bombings as regimented as prison meals			0
we were attacked an average of three times a day			2
we were filming as the scale of atrocities unfolded with excruciating precision : the bombs falling , the people hiding in caves for safety , the destruction of villages , the casualties			2
every day , we experienced hunger , fear , abandonment , exhaustion and unspeakable harshness , like the @entity8 people do			1
at a moment 's notice , we jumped in and out of foxholes and crawled in caves like they do to survive			0
cramped , hot and terrified , we have seen and smelled the death of children , pregnant women and the elderly ; the destruction of villages , crops , schools , water pumps , mosques , churches and hospitals			0
in the making of " erasing the @entity8 " we were bombed 19 times and lived to tell the story of resilience of a people harassed daily by landmines and rockets , in a region transformed into ghost towns , craters and ruins			1

almost 63,000 @entity8 have fled to the @entity138 refugee camp in @entity10			1
there i saw a people left to fend for themselves , a people that know they have no friends , yet determined to face their destiny with the only thing they have left : dignity			2
in @entity138 , i attended a @entity149 - sponsored food distribution and saw how a 3kg ration of @entity152 - produced sorghum was distributed for each family to eat until the uncertain next round of food supply			0
in @entity138 , a mother begged me to take home with me her three - month - old baby , whom she had delivered squatted down under a tree on a rainy afternoon			0
i sat with @entity138 's oldest resident , a 101 - year - old man who journeyed on donkey back for eight days to be reunited with one of his sons			2
the poor man was so disoriented that he had stopped eating and talking for days at a time			0
his family feared that leaving him alone might drive him to commit suicide			0
in yida i watched children sitting on the branches of a tree to follow a mathematics class as the open - air " classroom " was packed			0
it struck me to see how one adult volunteer could teach a class of children , without the use of a blackboard and chalk			0
there is no such thing as pens or notebooks for the thousands of children in need of an education at @entity138			0
see also : @entity10 violence amounts to war crimes dreams for domestic reconciliation exhausted after two decades , the @entity8 are holding onto the belief that " the hearts of the international community " woven into the fabric of our shared humanity " will hear their cries			1
" they say they have been sacrificed at the altar of peace agreements between @entity59 and they feel cheated by the world 's inaction			0
" erasing the @entity8 " has captured the spirit of the @entity8 people of @entity10 , a minority bowed but not broken -- not by the daily hellish rain of bombs and rockets , nor by the world 's complicit silence			1
but for how much longer can they prevail -- hostages of @entity14 and us , the international community ? a group of people and their way of life is being destroyed			1
why are the @entity8 , the heirs of a civilization that once stretched from @entity223 to @entity224 , asked to shake hands with @entity38 , and his murderous gang of " butchers of @entity14 " ? would one have asked @entity229 nations to make peace with @entity231 ? they have been forced to crawl in caves like beasts , survive on leaves and berries only to be told of a " @entity237			1
" unlike @entity238 in @entity239 -- bad as he is -- only one current head of state in the world is indicted officially by a due legal process : @entity37			0
yet many in the world are advocating the removal of @entity238			0
mountains of grudges and greed fuel this conflict , where humanitarian assistance is used as a pawn on the chessboard of peace negotiations			0
beneath the surface , jumbles of players -- local and foreign -- are waging a merciless war against each other for the political , economic and military control of the two @entity59			0
there can be no peace , no security , no stability , no settlement to this conflict as long as the blood of the @entity8 children , women , men and communities will be spilled			2
my family falling victim to the @entity54 genocides that started in 1994 , and a commitment to uphold the vow made by those touched by genocide the world over to " never forget , " inspired me to bring their story to light			0
" erasing the @entity8 " is my testimony , as a @entity54 and a journalist , to ensure these people are never referred to in the past tense			1
