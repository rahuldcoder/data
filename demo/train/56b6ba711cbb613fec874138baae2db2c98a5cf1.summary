-- for the first time in history , slavery can be brought to an end			1
what 's more , we already know how to do it			1
even if the cost of ending slavery were astronomical , we should do it -- but in fact the cost is surprisingly low			1
a number of forces have come together to create a unique moment			0
on one side there has been a recent rapid growth in the number of slaves worldwide			1
the population explosion , coupled with natural disasters , epidemic disease , civil war , grinding poverty , and especially government corruption , made millions of people vulnerable to slavery			1
the result is some 27 million people in slavery today			2
these are real slaves , controlled by violence , paid nothing , unable to walk away , and making fat profits for criminal slaveholders			2
slaves are concentrated in @entity36 and @entity37 , across @entity38 and @entity39 , and in @entity40 , but virtually every country has slavery , and the @entity42 is estimated to have 40,000 hidden slaves			1
around the world , slaves do dirty , dangerous work , everything from agriculture to prostitution , and their lives are brutal and short			2
the lives of slaves have changed little over the centuries , but the price of slaves has collapsed to an all - time low			1
for all of history , slaves have been expensive capital investments , costing an average $ 45,000 in today 's dollars			1
today the average price of a slave is $ 90			0
this means slaves are disposable , so cheap it is not worth giving them medical care when they are sick or injured , and it 's easy to just dump them when they are used up			1
it is an ugly problem , but at the same time , everything has clicked into place to make the end of slavery possible			1
the current number of slaves , 27 million , is the smallest percentage of the global population ever			2
the $ 40 billion they produce each year is the smallest fraction of the global economy ever represented by slave labor			0
read more about @entity80 at @entity81 slavery is illegal in every country and denounced in @entity85 conventions			1
there is no support for slavery from moral authorities , religious or political groups			2
and no industry or economy is dependent on slavery			2
in fact , if slavery ended tomorrow , consumers would n't see any price increases			2
slavery has been pushed to the criminal edges of our global society and to the very edge of its own extinction			2
there is no silver bullet that kills slavery , but over the past ten years an arsenal of effective responses has shown that you can end slavery and make communities slave - proof			1
one powerful vaccination against slavery is to make sure freed slaves build lives of economic stability			1
this means education , skill training , micro-finance , and citizenship -- all the things denied @entity42 ex-slaves in 1865			1
@entity42 are still paying the price for their botched emancipation			0
meanwhile , freed slaves given opportunities today generate economic growth through a " freedom dividend			1
" the modern anti-slavery movement is growing rapidly , and freedom is coming to an ever - increasing number of slaves			2
the end of slavery is possible , but three things have to happen			1
first , governments have to keep the promises they made when they passed laws against slavery			0
the laws are on the books , but police are untrained and budgets are woefully inadequate			0
second , the public needs to be aware that slavery is all around us , and that it can be brought to an end			1
third , resources have to flow to those areas of the world where slavery is rife -- resources from international aid , charities , @entity150 and @entity151 , and businesses			0
more funding is needed to provide for more anti-slavery workers			0
when it is done right , the results are spectacular			0
take the village of @entity157 in northern @entity158			0
all the families there were hereditary slaves in a stone quarry			0
all children worked , there was no school , and all women risked regular sexual assault by the slaveholders			0
a @entity169 partner organization sent in a community organizer who helped the families to stand up to their masters and renounce slavery			0
it was a tense and dangerous tactic , and at one point the slaveholders burnt down many of the huts where the families lived			0
after a few months , the crisis passed and the villagers embarked on new lives , many of them now running their own quarry			0
the children went to school and some ex-slaves even ran for elected office			0
now in stable lives , it would take an armed invasion to push them back to slavery			0
