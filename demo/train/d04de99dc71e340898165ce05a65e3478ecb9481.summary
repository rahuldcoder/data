-- sunday night 's 55th annual @entity1 were as much about the performances as it was the actual statues handed out			1
the evening saw some powerful collaborations among artists , and all eyes were on one controversial performer			0
here are the top 5 moments of the night : 1 ) killer performances take your pick			2
from a spirited performance of " @entity15 " by an all - star group including sir @entity17 , @entity18 , the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 of the @entity23 , to the many duets like @entity26 crooner @entity25 with @entity27 and @entity28 with fellow country artist @entity29 , it was all thrilling			1
reminded us as to why we loved them when they performed " @entity33			0
" but they won a big award of the night , song of the year , for their hit " @entity38			1
" and the stars in the audience were grooving along during a tribute to @entity42 led by @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			0
even @entity48 won us over when she took to the stage dressed as a ringmaster and surrounded by circus / carnival types to kick off the ceremony with her hit " @entity54			0
" grammy coverage on @entity56 but one of the most eagerly awaited performances was : 2 ) the return of @entity60 to the stage the @entity1 went sepia - toned for @entity60 's performance of his new single " @entity63 , " which offered plenty of homage to the @entity67 era with @entity60 in a tux with a bow tie and a big band with similarly suited backup singers billed as " @entity72			1
" @entity73 left his seat in the audience to run up on stage for his rap portion of the song			0
and @entity60 was cooler than cool as he segued into his new single " @entity79			0
" the performance marked the return of @entity60 to music since he took a four - year break to focus on acting			1
3 ) @entity86 pulls triple duty sure , he 's a big acting star now , but do n't forget that @entity86 , aka @entity86 , got his start in the hip hop game			1
so it felt right when the @entity1 host donned a knit cap , a black t - shirt and some subtle bling to perform alongside @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			1
they closed out the show with " @entity101 " and shouted out the @entity102 , @entity103 , with a " @entity105 " chant			2
he also kept the audience informed of what folks were saying on social media , reading tweets and responding to some			0
the @entity1 got its monies worth with him			1
4 ) @entity115 did n't wear black you ca n't not love her as she sings like an angel , is hilarious and just seems so normal			0
but just like you can always count on a practically flawless performance when she grabs the mic , we thought she was also a sure bet to show up in a black frock			1
it 's kind of been like her thing			0
but no. when @entity115 took to the stage to claim the first award of the night , best pop solo performance for " @entity131 , " she was wearing a flowery , red and black @entity133 dress			1
new life as a mom and clearly new fashion choices : it was almost as surprising as @entity138 showing up to present @entity140 and @entity141 the record of the year award for " @entity142			2
5 ) the somewhat anticlimactic appearance of @entity144 with @entity44 despite a few cutaways of the pair sitting together in the audience and @entity144 standing and clapping following her performance , seeing the two together was not as big a deal as the run up felt like it should be			2
friday marked the fourth anniversary of @entity144 's assault on @entity44 , which occurred before that year 's @entity1 ceremony			1
the pair had been a huge focus of this year 's @entity1 as fans waited to see if they would arrive at the ceremony together and how much " togetherness " they would exhibit			1
but in the end it felt like really no big deal			0
more surprising was six - time nominee @entity164 not winning any of the big awards he was up for			2
@entity166 scored best urban contemporary album and shared best rap collaboration with @entity169 and @entity73 for " @entity170 , " but lost best new artist to @entity172			0
and album of the year to @entity21			1
@entity174 : the winners list it was also more fun checking to see which artists ignored the reported @entity1 memo asking them to cover up ( we are looking at you and your rather exposed bosom @entity181 )			2
@entity182 even joked about it while presenting			0
" as you can see i read the memo , " @entity184 said , wearing a black dress cut extremely high and fully exposing one leg			0
