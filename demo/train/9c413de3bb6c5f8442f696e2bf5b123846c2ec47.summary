the millennials are growing up , but they are not growing out of their liberalism			1
the generation born since 1981 is the age group most likely to vote @entity4			1
the eldest of them are in their 30s now , and they continue to be much more liberal than previous - age cohorts at the same point in their lives			2
a big new survey by the @entity12 seeks to understand why			1
its report carries political warnings for conservatives -- and some larger warnings for us all			1
the warning for conservatives is : millennial attachment to the @entity4 is not a phase			1
millennials are far less likely to be religiously affiliated than their elders			1
they are more likely to have children outside marriage ( 47 % of their children are born outside marriage , compared with only 35 % of @entity32 children in 1996 )			0
they are poorer than their predecessor generations at the same point in their life cycles			0
despite facing higher levels of unemployment and student loans , millennials stand out -- in @entity12 's phrase -- " as the nation 's most stubborn economic optimists			1
" a majority expect that they will earn enough money in the future to live the lives they want			0
let 's hope their dreams come true			0
but looking at the demographic and economic statistics , that 's not the way to bet			0
what then ? here 's a generation detached from religious institutions and only weakly attached to the country : only 49 % of millennials describe themselves as patriotic , compared with 64 % of the next older cohort and 75 % of baby boomers			1
what will happen if they feel disappointed as well ? one prediction about their future is already coming true : the millennial generation will be a generation characterized by high levels of inter-ethnic political conflict			0
among the young as among the old , political preferences are cleaved by race and ethnicity			0
one obvious example : non-white millennials approve of president @entity84 's job performance by a 2 - 1 ratio			1
white millennials disapprove by almost the same margin			2
by a margin of 52 % to 39 % , white millennials prefer a smaller government that offers fewer services to a bigger government that offers more			2
non-white millennials say the opposite by a margin of 71 % to 21 %			2
these numbers show a racial gap about the same as among the older cohorts			0
however , since non-whites make up a bigger portion of the millennials than in older generations , their overwhelming preference for a more activist government will sway future elections even more than recent ones			2
good news for liberals ? maybe			0
since @entity113 's clarion " ask not , " liberals have tried to call @entity109 to a politics of common purpose			1
the continuing sharp divide between the politics of the country 's dwindling white former majority and its emerging non-white new majority may portend that common purpose will recede even further out of reach than ever			0
a quality of millennials that leaps out from the survey is their deep mistrust of other people			1
in response to the question , " generally speaking , would you say that most people can be trusted or that you ca n't be too careful in dealing with people , " just 19 % of millennials say most people can be trusted , compared with 31 % of @entity32 , 37 % of the silent generation and 40 % of boomers			2
@entity12 hypothesizes that this low level of trust is a consequence of the economic vulnerability of the milllennial generation : " people who feel vulnerable or disadvantaged for whatever reason find it riskier to trust because they 're less well - fortified to deal with the consequences of misplaced trust			1
" yet there 's another -- and more ominous -- explanation lurking in the numbers			0
@entity149 of " @entity150 " fame has collected data showing that social trust declines as a community becomes more ethnically diverse			1
" the short run effect of being around people who are different from us is to make all of us uncertain -- to hunker down , to pull in , to trust everybody less			2
like a turtle in the presence of some feared threat , we pull in			0
" in other words , in a more diverse society , it 's not just those who feel vulnerable who trust less			1
in a more diverse society , everybody trusts less			2
the clarion call of common purpose begins to sound more like a warning alarm that your group is about to be used for the benefit of another			0
the accusation that the ( non-white ) " takers " are plundering the ( white ) " makers " has powered protest politics since 2009			0
if anything , that accusation looks likely to increase in its political effect in the years ahead			0
as @entity109 has become more ethnically diverse , political leaders have insisted ever more persistently that this diversity is a source of strength			1
let 's hope that proves to be true			0
@entity109 will need that strength in a future that , by the number , seems likely to be more mutually suspicious , more alienated , more unequal and less united by patriotism .			1

a @entity12 report says millennials are most likely to vote @entity4
@entity198 : survey indicates that they are less trusting , patriotic , more alienated
some say social trust declines as a community becomes more ethnically diverse
@entity205 : as @entity109 becomes more ethnically diverse , will diversity be a source of strength ?
