-- @entity2 president @entity1 has warned his team not to get carried away by this season 's remarkable turnaround in form			1
two - time world champion @entity7 will take a 34 - point lead over @entity10 's @entity9 into sunday 's @entity11 despite having almost written off the @entity2 's title chances in preseason			1
after early misgivings over the 2012 car , the @entity14 now has three successes from 10 starts -- two of them in the last three grands prix			0
@entity9 , with two victories , is the only other driver to have topped the podium more than once			0
@entity7 's teammate @entity23 is back in 14th overall with only 23 points , meaning second - placed @entity2 trail @entity10 by 53 points in the manufacturers ' standings after last sunday 's race in @entity31			1
" i am concerned , more so than the day after @entity32 ( when @entity7 won his second race of 2012 ) , " @entity1 said on the @entity34 website ahead of the final race before @entity37 's month - long break			1
latest @entity37 standings " i see very strong opponents : @entity41 has made great progress , @entity10 is very strong , @entity43 had a race pace that was a match for ours and @entity46 is very strong at times			1
" therefore , we have to be very careful			0
after we had a difficult start to the season , maybe our rivals did not expect to see @entity2 capable of fighting back this strongly , but now they will redouble their efforts to beat us			1
therefore , we must stay very focused and continue our efforts to improve continuously			2
" @entity7 was third at the @entity53 last year as @entity54 gave @entity41 a fifth victory in seven years at the circuit , which is one of the slowest on the @entity37 calendar			1
" it 's going to be tight again			2
it 's a very short circuit , and as we saw this year , in two - or three - tenths there are eight , nine cars , " @entity7 said on the @entity37 website			1
" in @entity64 we need to make a perfect preparation again , a perfect qualifying , because you can be starting in 12th or 13th if you make a little mistake , so we need to approach the race in the same way we did the last couple , try to maximize what we have in @entity64 and hopefully bring in some new parts that can help us			0
@entity41 chief : @entity37 teams must unite " at the moment our car seems okay in all areas , there are not weak points , as maybe we had at the beginning of the season when we were suffering a little bit on traction and top speed			1
now i think that we are okay on that			0
" in @entity64 with these slow - speed corners , i do n't see any problem with the car			0
we should be competitive there			0
" @entity54 returned to form with second place at @entity92 , and @entity41 hope that last weekend 's upgrades will make the team even more competitive at a track where @entity96 won in 2007 and 2009 -- and former drivers @entity97 ( 2005 ) and @entity99 ( 2008 ) also triumphed			1
" the race pace certainly enabled @entity54 to stay in touch with the @entity10 and @entity103 , " said managing director @entity100			0
" so on that day , on that circuit , in those conditions we were there or thereabouts			0
i do n't think that we are dominant and we need to continue to work very hard			2
but we 're pleased with it			0
" @entity54 also won in @entity109 for @entity110 in 2006 for the first victory of his career , after @entity97 took pole position for @entity41			1
" ( last year ) i celebrated my 200th grand prix there on the saturday evening with some of my oldest friends and colleagues in the paddock and i went on to win on sunday			0
it was the perfect weekend , " the @entity119 recalled			0
" there 's every reason to believe we can get another good result this year			2
our pace at @entity92 gives us cause for encouragement -- it 's just that , as always , we 'll need to run flawlessly through qualifying and the race if we 're to be in the hunt at the end			2
" @entity133 discharged from @entity135 hospital @entity10 's two - time defending world champion @entity136 was second in @entity64 last year , and is aiming to bounce back from last weekend 's disappointment at @entity92 when he was demoted to fifth for an illegal late overtaking move on @entity54			1
however , the @entity135 - based @entity140 team will need to make adjustments after ruling body the @entity143 deemed @entity10 's engine mapping to change the aerodynamics of the cars and therefore be illegal			1
" the track is one of the slowest on the calendar , but as a driver you should n't underestimate it as there are a lot of opportunities to make mistakes , " the @entity31 said			0
" it can be very hot and that means the track can be very demanding physically			0
in addition , the surface has many bumps which shake you around a lot			0
" rain is forecast for friday 's practice sessions , but the weather should be hot and sunny for qualifying on saturday and the race on sunday			2
" a twisty and slippery circuit will often put more heat through the tire than a fast and flowing layout as the tire is moving around more -- particularly when the ambient temperatures are high , " said @entity168 , managing director of @entity37 's sole supplier @entity170			1
" having said that , in @entity64 last year we saw some wet weather , so it 's important not to make any assumptions			2
consequently , we are still lacking some information about the performance of our slick tires under race conditions at the @entity53			2
" meanwhile , @entity186 test driver @entity185 has left hospital in her native @entity188 and will return home to recover from the crash in @entity135 that cost her an eye			1
" the patient 's general conditions are good , which allowed us to release her , " her website reported on thursday			2
" in the last six days , she has been treated by specialists of the plastic and neurological surgery services , and the ophthalmology department , who will continue to follow her as she will need to undergo periodical checks and treatments			0
" from a neurological point of view , the patient does not present any deficit and does not need any surgery			0
" @entity133 , one of two women contracted to an @entity37 team this year , collided with a stationary support truck after completing her first lap at her first test outing for the @entity135 - based @entity212 marque .			1
