-- the downing of @entity2 17 over eastern @entity3 last week , most likely after being struck with a missile fired by @entity6 rebel forces , was followed this week by the rebels ' shoot - down of two @entity10 attack aircraft deployed by the @entity11			1
these incidents reflect a typical pattern in insurgencies and counterinsurgency operations			2
air power is often crucial in fighting insurgents , as it has been recently in @entity3			2
the @entity3 air force has made up for the poor performance of @entity3 ground units by driving rebel forces into retreat			0
the @entity10 ground - attack planes that were shot down this week were part of a renewed @entity3 air offensive against rebel positions			1
because governments fighting insurgencies often enjoy a monopoly or major advantage in air power , rebel fighters must try to offset this advantage by using surface - to - air missiles , or @entity35 , and other air - defense weapons			0
that is precisely what has been happening recently in @entity3 , where @entity6 rebels have shot down at least a dozen @entity3 military aircraft over the past few months			1
the downing of @entity42 was apparently a tragic mistake , not a deliberate attack on a passenger airliner flying at high altitude			1
the @entity6 rebels evidently believed the target was a large military transport aircraft , only to realize afterward that they had committed a terrible blunder			2
who are @entity3 's @entity52 rebels ? but even if the downing of the airliner had been deliberate , it would not have been unprecedented			0
indeed , on numerous occasions , insurgents armed by @entity57 have deliberately shot down civilian planes			2
in september 1978 , guerrillas from the @entity61 shot down an @entity63 passenger airliner using a @entity66 - supplied @entity65 shoulder - fired @entity64			0
dozens were killed in the crash , but 56 passengers survived			0
the guerrillas methodically hunted down the survivors and killed them ( though a small number evaded death by hiding )			0
five months later , in february 1979 , @entity75 guerrillas once again used a @entity66 - supplied @entity65 to shoot down an @entity63 passenger aircraft			2
all the passengers and crew died in the crash			0
in december 1988 , @entity81 guerrillas in @entity82 used @entity66 - supplied missiles to attack two @entity86 @entity85 civilian aircraft that were spreading insecticide against a locust infestation			1
one of the planes crashed , killing all five @entity86 on board			0
after the @entity66 broke apart , the new government in @entity57 continued to arm and train insurgent forces , focusing on other former @entity66 republics			0
on three consecutive days in september 1993 , @entity94 - backed separatist guerrillas in the @entity96 region of @entity97 deliberately attacked @entity99 passenger flights , using @entity94 - supplied shoulder - held sa - 7s against two of them in flight and artillery against the third during boarding			1
a total of 136 people were killed in the three incidents			0
this record of @entity66 and @entity94 support for insurgents who target civilian aircraft is important to bear in mind when judging the latest crisis over @entity3			1
in all these earlier instances from the 1970s through the 1990s , @entity57 - backed guerrillas deliberately attacked civilian planes			2
by contrast , in last week 's downing of @entity42 , the likelihood is that the rebels only targeted the passenger aircraft because they thought it was a military plane			2
no one has yet apologized for the incident , and the @entity6 forces ' handling of the crash site has been despicable , but the downing was not akin to the deliberate attacks that occurred in earlier years			0
many flights soar over conflict zones many observers have depicted events in @entity3 , including the @entity42 tragedy , as reflecting something peculiar about @entity94 foreign policy under president @entity137			1
but as the 1993 attacks by @entity96 fighters indicate , @entity137 's predecessor @entity138 often dealt with @entity94 's neighbors in a similar manner , seeing them as little more than vassal states			1
under both @entity138 and @entity137 , @entity94 has bullied , intimidated , destabilized and violated the sovereignty of its neighbors , especially @entity97 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity3 , and @entity148 , whenever they have been led by rulers the @entity94 authorities dislike			1
since 1992 , @entity94 has consistently supported the entrenchment of authoritarian regimes in neighboring states and opposed upheavals and popular unrest directed against authoritarian rulers			1
the historical record of @entity94 's domineering policy toward other former @entity66 republics has often been disregarded in the recent flurry of commentary about @entity3 and @entity42			1
one observer , writing last week on @entity163 , declared that the @entity42 disaster marked " the first case of rebels , supplied by a major power with surface - to - air missiles , bringing down a passenger plane			0
" that statement is absurd and reflects an underlying ignorance of the long record of @entity94 's imperious dealings with its neighbors			1
when thinking about where things might head now in @entity3 , we need to separate entrenched patterns from what is truly distinctive			0
many observers get caught up with the daily twists and turns and fail to consider relevant historical precedents			0
in each case in the past when @entity57 - backed guerrillas deliberately attacked civilian aircraft , the incidents had no lasting impact on the conflicts and did not induce the @entity190 to back down			1
after the september 1993 attacks that destroyed three @entity97 passenger planes , @entity138 not only maintained his staunch support of the @entity96 separatists but also deployed thousands of @entity94 troops in @entity96 to deter the @entity97 government from trying to reclaim it			1
over the past week many have predicted that @entity42 will be a " game - changer " and might even lead to the unraveling of @entity137 's regime			2
the historical record gives us little reason to be confident about such optimistic prognoses			0
join us on @entity207 / @entity206 .			0

@entity209 : @entity94 and its *proxies* have a history of shooting down civilian aircraft
@entity209 : @entity94 has bullied , intimidated and violated the sovereignty of its neighbors
there is little evidence that this attack , or others in the past , will induce the @entity190 to back down
