-- last week @entity1 announced a squeeze which will make most frequent flyers groan , but today the @entity5 firm unveiled how passengers flying on its new @entity7 might travel			1
two test planes have been fitted out with full economy and business class interiors			2
the economy cabin has a nine - abreast configuration , with 18 - inch wide seats , while business class has just four seats per row			1
@entity1 boasts that the new , extra wide - body planes will have near - vertical walls and larger overhead baggage bins compared to its current fleet of aircraft			1
and for passengers with long legs , there should n't be any more issues with in - flight entertainment ( @entity27 ) boxes blocking the space under the seat in front of them ; @entity1 has placed all the electronic boxes and connections under the floor			1
another innovation is the full cabin led lighting that @entity1 says can offer a mind - boggling 16.7 million possible colors			2
" passenger comfort is an increasingly important differentiator for the airline industry , becoming a fundamental deciding factor driving passenger choice and business success , " said @entity40 , senior vice president of marketing at @entity1			0
