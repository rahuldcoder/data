-- when the sky falls , you 'd think people would run for cover			2
if the clouds cooperate , skies all over @entity6 will light up between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. et saturday in a rare sight that 's excited everyone from space geeks to insomniacs to regular folks			1
" i am so pumped for the @entity14 , " tweeted one woman			0
actually , these meteors are n't necessarily falling on the @entity16			1
rather , it 's the @entity16 that 's moving through the debris of @entity19			1
whatever the reason , experts say this one - night - only phenomenon known as the @entity23 could produce a huge light show -- or be a dud			1
@entity27 's @entity26 noted that some forecasters are predicting about 100 meteors per hour , while others have much higher expectations , predicting more than 1,000 meteors per hour			1
it 's not like there 's a lot of history to say which way things will go			0
" we have no idea what the comet was doing in the 1800s , " said @entity39 , the head of @entity27 's @entity40			2
" the parent comet does n't appear to be very active now , so there could be a great show or there could be little activity			2
" @entity52 - inspiring photos : ' blood moon ' mesmerizes sky gazers still , the mere prospect of a big light show is enough to get people up in the middle of the night -- if they go to sleep at all -- to take it all in			2
@entity0 meteorologist @entity60 noted that this is the first time in a generation that @entity63 can see a new meteor shower			1
this cosmic event has been years in the making : @entity27 announced in 2012 that @entity16 would encounter debris from this comet -- which also rotates around the sun -- crossing our orbit this weekend			1
the meteors should radiate from a point in @entity74 , a faint constellation near the @entity76 that 's also known as " the giraffe , " @entity39 said			0
the @entity26 recommends that those who want to see the show find a spot away from city lights , give themselves time to adjust to looking at the night sky and use their own eyes ( no binoculars necessary ) to enjoy the view			0
the best place to watch the shower will be east of the @entity88 or in @entity89			0
the worst may be parts of the @entity91 and @entity92 , where rain and cloud cover is possible			0
if you 're in @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 or @entity99 , do n't even bother to look			0
several people tweeted about what they 'll be wishing on , while others wished for someone with whom they could enjoy the occasion			0
" meteor shower tonight ! ! ! ! ! " read one post			1
" everyone turn off lights , go outside , put down blankets , cuddle up and enjoy ! ! ! ! but not everyone is comfortable with the spectacle , it seems			0
" everyone wants me to watch the meteor shower , " tweeted one woman , " but i think he deserves his privacy			1
" astronaut tells kid , ' you 'd love it up here ' @entity0 's @entity121 contributed to this report .			0

may @entity23 could light up skies over @entity6 early saturday
the meteor shower is from the @entity16 passing through the debris of a comet
forecasters say it will produce as few as 100 or as many as 1,000 meteors an hour
*scores* of people on @entity136 express excitement about the cosmic event
