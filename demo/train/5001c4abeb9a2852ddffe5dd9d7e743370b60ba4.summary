-- @entity3 , the queen of @entity4 , died from drinking a mixture of poisons and not from a snake bite , a @entity2 historian said wednesday			1
the theory by @entity9 , a professor of ancient history at @entity11 , challenges the common , centuries - old belief that @entity3 committed suicide with the bite of an asp			1
" it is certain that there was no cobra , " @entity9 told @entity0 by phone wednesday			0
an asp is a small venomous snake also called the @entity4 cobra			0
@entity9 said he studied historic writings and consulted a toxicologist to develop the theory , which is due to be featured wednesday on the @entity2 channel @entity26 as part of a program on the @entity4 queen			1
he also deduced that @entity3 would n't have chosen to die by a snake bite because she was intent on suicide -- and a cobra , he said , is not always fatal			1
when a person does die from a cobra bite , he said , " it does n't go quickly -- it is a horrible death , " in which it takes hours to die and the victim suffers paralysis to parts of their body , including the eyes			0
@entity3 died a " quiet and pain - free death , " according to the @entity44 historian @entity43 , writing about 200 years after she died , @entity9 said			1
ancient texts also say @entity3 's two assistants died with her , but that would be unlikely if she had died of a snake bite , the historian said			1
also , temperatures in august -- when @entity3 committed suicide in 30 @entity53 -- would have been so high that a snake probably would n't have stayed still enough to bite , he said			1
ancient papyri show that @entity3 knew about poisons , and one papyrus says she actually tested them , @entity9 said			1
death by poison would make sense given the way in which @entity3 wanted to die , and the fact that she died at the same time as her two handmaidens , he said			2
@entity9 said he worked with @entity2 toxicologist @entity65 to determine which poisons @entity3 might have used			1
they decided it was hemlock , mixed with wolfsbane and opium			0
" opium is quiet and with it , one can really fall into a deadly sleep , " @entity9 said			0
asked why the tale of the asp has lingered for more than 2,000 years , he said most people simply believed the common story			0
a cobra can be fatal , and @entity3 has historically been pictured with one , " so it makes sense " for people to believe that version , he said			2
many of the ancient depictions of @entity3 with a cobra , however , were simply showing her reception in the afterlife , he said			2
it was only in the 15th century that painters first started showing @entity3 with an asp on her arm , and later , they painted the snake on her breast			2
in @entity94 's @entity93 , she dies in the final scene from the bite of two asps -- one to her breast and one to her arm			0
@entity3 ruled @entity4 from 51 to 30 b.c. and was the last pharaoh before @entity4 became a roman province			2
she was @entity100 's mistress in @entity101 and , after he was assassinated , she returned to @entity4 and began a relationship with @entity103 , one of the three leaders of @entity101 after @entity100 's death			0
@entity3 joined @entity103 at the @entity106 in @entity107			0
he committed suicide when his forces were defeated , and @entity3 then returned to @entity4 to do the same .			0
