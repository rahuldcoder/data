-- deep in my heart , i do believe that we shall overcome someday : this is the refrain that guided the hearts and hands and voices of the ' 60s generation			0
at the @entity12 , april 8 - 10 , the @entity11 will begin -- the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the passage of the great 1960s civil rights laws			1
it was legislation that changed @entity19 forever and for the better			1
there were four great laws , each building upon the other			1
the 1964 @entity24 , also known as the @entity25 , ensured that people of color could use the same water fountains , toilets , public transport and seats in restaurants and hotels as white people			1
the @entity35 ensured people of color the right to vote			1
the @entity38 made it possible for people of color and all religions to be able to buy a house where they could afford to			1
the 1968 @entity43 eliminated racial and ethnic quotas			0
these laws opened the doors of liberty and justice for all as never before			1
no matter how imperfect they were , they made ours a more just society			0
for me it was all so very personal			0
my father , president @entity55 , signed the 1964 @entity56 on my 17th birthday			1
the only handwritten note i have from my father was his birthday letter written at 12:10 p.m. that day			1
@entity61 did n't have time to go to the pharmacy to buy a @entity65 card			0
at 6 p.m. , he was signing a bill into law that would liberate my generation from the shackles of legalized apartheid			2
it was the best birthday present anyone could ever receive			2
many doubt 1964 @entity56 could pass today when i questioned why he gave the first pen used to sign the bill to the @entity78 leader sen. @entity77 instead of one of the great civil rights leaders , he shook his head in disappointment that i had n't gotten the obvious lesson			1
he told me , " @entity84 , i did n't have to convince one of the great civil rights leaders to be for that legislation			1
they were already for it			0
but because of @entity77 's decision to support this law and bring his supporters with him , the great civil rights leaders and i have a law , not just a bill			1
that 's why @entity77 got the pen			2
" when i questioned why we had gone to the @entity99 for the signing , @entity61 shook his head in disappointment again			0
" @entity84 , we have to go to the @entity99 of the @entity102			1
" there will be many brave men and women not returning to these hallowed halls because of their courageous stand for voting rights			2
and there are many brave men and women who will be able to serve here only because of the courage of this @entity114			0
that 's why we must go to the @entity99 to let the world know how grateful we are to this @entity114			2
" i was on " daddy duty " on august 6 , 1965 , and stood behind him in the @entity99 as he signed the @entity35 into law			1
that day he taught me not only about the justice of the act ; he taught me the importance of his favorite biblical passage , " come , let us reason together			1
" these lessons of social justice have changed our country forever , for the better , although their work is far from done			2
the lessons of coming and reasoning together remain a cry we need to answer now more than ever			0
it was all so very personal			0
i grew up in @entity132 in an area fondly known as " @entity134			0
" we lived in " @entity135 " because there were no restrictive covenants as there were in other areas that discriminated against buyers based on their color or religion			2
my first employer and forever friend was one of the first @entity146 able to buy a home in what had been a restricted neighborhood			0
the @entity38 was not just a bill for justice to me			2
it was all so very personal			0
there are 25 members in my immediate family			0
we are of mixed race , mixed ethnicities , many nationalities			0
we are @entity158 , protestants , @entity146 and others			0
we are a family of immigrants with all the diversity that @entity55 celebrated			1
at the head of the stairs in the @entity12 is one of my favorite quotes of my father			1
" until justice is blind to color , until education is unaware of race , until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men 's skins , emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact			1
" much was accomplished when our nation " came and reasoned together			0
" but there are still laws that make it harder for the poor to have access to the voting booth			2
and there are laws that still exist that bar equality based on whom you love			2
there remains much to be done			0
generations of @entity193 are so grateful that four presidents are coming to the @entity12 to celebrate this civil rights 50th anniversary with a new generation committed to social justice			1
it is our hope that by coming and reasoning together once more , we can renew our commitment to making ours a country " blind to color , where education is unaware of race and opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men 's skins			1
" only then will our proclamation for emancipation become a fact			0
only then will we overcome the bondage of social injustice that hurts us all			0
but with a new renewal to the needs of social justice , i do believe , deep in my heart that we shall overcome someday !			0
