-- despite a 911 operator 's urgent pleas , a staffer with cpr training at an elderly living facility refused to perform the procedure on a resident who had stopped breathing			1
the reason for the refusal ? @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , has a policy against its employees providing medical care			1
@entity17 , 87 , died			1
shocking ? does this all sound just plain wrong ? well , medical professionals , lawyers and those who work in the world of elderly independent living say it 's much more complicated			1
while all states have so - called @entity28 laws aimed at protecting people against legal liability if they jump in to perform cpr on someone who needs it , few people know about the laws			1
and @entity28 laws have been fiercely challenged in courts across the country , leaving the average person unclear about just how protected they may be			1
" in @entity43 where there 's a lawyer behind every defibrillator , there 's worry that some people have ' am i going to get sued ? ' " said @entity40 , a medical ethicist at @entity41			1
last week , shortly after @entity17 ' death , the family said they were satisfied with the care she received , according to @entity53			1
" i never said i was fine with that , " daughter @entity54 told @entity0 monday before hanging up the phone			2
" that was completely taken out of context , and i have no further comment			2
" from a " medical ethics point of view , i think if you call 911 , and 911 says , ' start @entity31 , ' you have to do it , " @entity40 said			1
" you are under an obligation to do it			2
you 've started that process and you must follow through			2
" the policy on paper may make sense , " he said , " but policy be damned when someone 's life is at stake			1
" the 911 call when @entity17 collapsed in a dining room last tuesday morning , someone at @entity75 called 911 , and @entity78 dispatcher @entity77 answered			1
a @entity75 employee gave the phone to a nurse who identified herself as @entity82			0
during the call , @entity77 tried to reason with @entity82 to start @entity31 , and when she said her boss wo n't allow that , the dispatcher asked her to hand the phone to someone nearby , or anyone the nurse could flag down who was not beholden to the facility 's policy			1
" i understand if your boss is telling you you ca n't do it , " the dispatcher said			0
" but ... as a human being ... you know ... is there anybody that 's willing to help this lady and not let her die ? " " not at this time , " @entity82 answered			1
in the last three minutes of the call , @entity77 said , " ok			1
i do n't understand why you 're not willing to help this patient			0
" @entity82 : " i am but , i 'm just saying that ... " dispatcher : " ok , i 'll walk you through it all			0
we , @entity107 take the liability for this , @entity82			0
i 'm happy to help you			0
" @entity82 is then heard asking someone nearby to call a supervisor			2
" can you get ( unintelligible ) ... right away , " @entity82 said			0
" i do n't know where he is			0
but she 's yelling at me and saying we have to have one of our other residents perform @entity31			1
i 'm feeling stressed and i 'm not going to do that , make that call			2
" the nurse asked the dispatcher when the fire department would arrive			0
" they 're coming as quick ... they 've been on the way all this time			0
but we ca n't wait			0
this lady is going to die , " the dispatcher answers			0
@entity82 replies , " yeah			0
" @entity75 ' corporate owner is @entity131 , based in @entity132			0
@entity0 asked spokesman @entity133 why a nurse would be involved if the facility 's policy prohibits staffers from performing medical care			1
" ( @entity82 ) was hired to be the resident services director and that is the capacity in which she was serving , " @entity133 explained in an e-mail			2
" @entity11 is an independent living facility which , by law , is not licensed to provide medical care to any of its residents , " @entity133 told @entity0			1
" we are conducting an internal review to determine all of the facts about what occurred while waiting for the paramedics , who arrived moments later , " he wrote			0
" we have communicated our deepest sympathies and condolences to this resident 's family on the passing of their loved one			1
" late tuesday night , @entity159 released a statement that said it was conducting a company - wide review of its policies			0
" this incident resulted from a complete misunderstanding of our practice with regards to emergency medical care for our residents , " the statement said			0
' @entity172 north star ' " how could someone who is trained as a medical professional have their views so inverted by a corporate policy ? " said dr. @entity173 , chief of the division of medical ethics at @entity176			2
" if this had happened on a city street in @entity184 , one would be governed by common morality			0
" the nurse at @entity11 is " confused about where their ethical north star is , " he said			0
fins and other experts pointed to @entity28 laws that seek to protect well - intentioned helpers who try to save someone in danger			1
but there have been challenges to @entity13 's @entity28 law			1
in 2009 , the state @entity198 ruled on a case involving a woman who tried to pull a motorist from a wrecked car			0
the woman was accused of yanking the motorist like a " rag doll " and worsening the motorist 's injuries			2
the court found that the woman was not covered under the state 's @entity28 law , which had been in place since 1980			1
the law provides that " no person who in good faith , and not for compensation , renders emergency care at the scene of an emergency shall be liable for any civil damages resulting from any act or omission			2
" and according to @entity40 , @entity225 's good samaritan law fines a person $ 100 if it 's clear that they could have stepped in to perform cpr but refused			1
the @entity229 told @entity0 that they 're investigating what happened at @entity75			0
dr. @entity231 , a professor of medicine at the @entity233 , said he was shocked by what happened there			0
@entity31 doubles survival odds , he said			1
" if liability was a concern , " @entity237 said			0
" i would suspect there is a greater liability if someone dies			0
" @entity0 's @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 contributed to this report .			2
