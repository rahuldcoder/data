-- it 's 10pm when the young men dressed in wetsuits rock up at @entity6 's hippest hangout			1
there 's already a line of people waiting to get in			0
but it 's not a cutting - edge bar or restaurant drawing the huge crowds -- it 's a river			2
welcome to the surreal world of urban surfing , where innovative thrill - seekers ride the waves of inner - city rivers			1
@entity6 's @entity19 -- located in the heart of the @entity22 city -- is one of a growing number of urban surfing spots around the world			1
from @entity28 's industrial ports to land - locked @entity30 's stunning waterways , @entity0 takes a look at this mesmerizing -- and often dangerous -- extreme sport			1
@entity22 ingenuity @entity6 may be 500 kilometers from the coast , but that has n't stopped a thriving surfing community springing up around its legendary @entity19			1
for more than four decades , surfers have been riding the one - meter waves gushing beneath a six - lane highway rumbling with traffic			2
even late at night , surfers can be found queuing up to jump in , with onlookers lining the bridge to catch a glimpse of the action below			1
the river , which runs through the city 's picturesque @entity48 , is just 12 - meters wide			2
but despite the small space , @entity50 is no easy ride , with only experienced surfers allowed to dive in			0
" i 'd surfed the ocean for five years , but river surfing is a totally different sport with a different movement , " said @entity55 , editor of @entity19 surfing zine			0
" it 's flowing so fast -- around 25 square meters of water per second			0
the wave is formed by fast water crashing into slow water			0
this creates the undercurrent which forms the tube			0
" taming the @entity69 think " surfing hotspot " and it 's unlikely @entity28 's @entity71 springs to mind			1
but not only is the 460 - kilometer river home to an annual festival attracting the best surfers from around the world , it 's also the site of a rare wave phenomenon that has been mesmerizing tourists for centuries			1
each autumn , a massive tidal bore -- a wave that travels against the current -- surges up the river			1
at nine - meters high and traveling at 40 kilometers per hour , the " @entity69 , " as it is known , is the largest tidal bore in the world and so powerful that only a small number of hefty commercial boats are allowed on the river at the same time			1
watch : @entity95 champ -- ' @entity96 can be feminine ' now a group of @entity99 surfers has launched an annual festival on the river , using jet skis to reach the bore which pounds through the city of @entity105			2
towering skyscrapers can be seen looming behind the daring surfers as they ride the murky @entity69			2
" hundreds of thousands of people flock to @entity105 during the @entity114 -- known as the @entity115 -- every year to stand on the banks and watch this natural phenomenon barrel past , " said @entity108 , business director @entity109 , a company promoting boardsports in @entity28			0
" the cityscape , the hundreds of thousands of people lining the banks , the exclusivity and just the fact that it 's @entity28 all adds to the drama , excitement and allure of surfing the @entity71			1
" no ocean ? no problem a small @entity129 country with no coastline hardly sounds like the destination of choice for surfing enthusiasts			2
but landlocked @entity30 -- with its snow - capped alps -- is proving to be the ideal training ground for a new generation of surfers			1
" we do n't have any beaches , but we do have a culture of board riding , " said @entity138 ¤ heli , president of the @entity139			0
" we have snowboarding in winter , with many riders wanting to do a similar sport in summer			0
" many villages in the country sit by a river flowing with icy water from the dramatic mountain range			0
an increasing number of surfers are now taking the plunge , with festivals held on the @entity155 flowing through the picturesque village of @entity157 in the north of the country			0
waves reach around one - meter in the pretty river			0
but be prepared to wait your turn -- on a nice day up to 40 people can be seen queuing for more than 30 minutes to ride the deep blue water .			0

no ocean ? no problem . innovative boarders are surfing city rivers
@entity6 's @entity171 attracts young thrill - seekers late into night
