@entity0 is a loving mother			1
a missionary who has traveled the world to help others			0
and now , the world knows her as an @entity9 patient			2
last month , while working in @entity10 , @entity0 contracted the deadly virus			1
she 's one of three americans known to contract @entity9 during the outbreak that has ravaged @entity14			1
the others are colleague dr. @entity16 and @entity17 , a naturalized citizen and @entity10 government official who died from the disease earlier this week			2
the missionary is expected to be picked up in @entity14 and flown back to the @entity21 , where she is expected to join @entity16 -- who arrived saturday -- in a special isolation unit at @entity25 's @entity24			1
according to @entity26 , a spokesman for the @entity28 charity @entity27 , she should be in @entity29 early next week			0
ebola patient walks into @entity25 hospital the trip will be the latest of many journeys for @entity0 , whose other missionary ventures include @entity35 and 14 years ministering to orphans and vulnerable children in @entity14			1
since august 2013 , the @entity38 have been in @entity39 , @entity10 , with the @entity40 , which worked with @entity27			0
@entity0 guided missionaries and teams and worked with nurses at @entity45 hospital , where her husband is the technical services manager , according to the @entity28 group 's website			2
@entity0 was diagnosed with @entity9 on july 25			1
those who know @entity0 best say that she 's motivated not by any quest for personal glory or thirst for adventure , but because she and her husband feel compelled to act because of their faith			1
as husband @entity56 explained from @entity14 via @entity57 to members of @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , at a recent vigil for @entity0 : " we have been blessed because of what @entity63 has done for us , ( by giving ) us eternal life and salvation			1
" what else could we do ( but help ) ? " the fact the @entity38 left the comforts of @entity21 to live in an area rife with poverty , instability and disease , the fact they put their lives at risk to assist those suffering everyday , is n't surprising to those who know them			0
@entity82 , their friend and pastor at @entity59 , describes the couple as " the @entity85 , " the kind of people who would n't give a second thought to dropping everything to help			2
the only thing perhaps ironic about what 's happening now is how such an " unassuming " and " very humble " woman has become international news			0
" she is ... not someone who would ever make the headlines , " @entity82 said , " apart from something like this			0
" that does n't change the fact the @entity38 have extraordinary lives			0
wherever they 've gone , their lives have been centered on their church and their family , including two now - adult sons who live in the @entity21			0
one of those sons , @entity108 , told @entity110 's @entity109 that the recent ordeal has been hard on his father			0
@entity0 has been isolated in the couple 's @entity10 home ; she and @entity56 talk by phone but , given fears she might pass on @entity9 to him , they ca n't touch			1
" it 's very difficult , and we feel the emotion of that , " @entity108 said of his parents ' physical separation			0
then , of course , there 's the inherent danger of @entity9			0
the @entity127 reports that there have been at least 1,322 cases in recent weeks in @entity14 , some 729 of which have resulted in death			0
even before it was known his mother would return to the @entity21 , where she 'll get top - notch care at @entity24 , @entity108 took solace the mortality rate is n't even higher			1
" we feel like @entity140 has a chance , " he told @entity110 affiliate @entity137			1
@entity25 hospital embraces chance to treat @entity9 patients			2
