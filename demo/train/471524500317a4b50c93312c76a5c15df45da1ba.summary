-- @entity1 and @entity2 both wanted to attend the @entity3 , and both claimed race was a primary reason for their rejection			2
they filed civil rights lawsuits and the @entity10 ultimately agreed to hear their appeals , filed more than a half - century apart			1
questions over academic competition , fairness , and demographics as well as the role of government in promoting political and social diversity populated their claims			0
but it is the key difference between the plaintiffs that now confronts the court : @entity1 was @entity25 , @entity2 is white			2
the justices are poised to rule this month in @entity2 's appeal , possibly in coming days , on the use of race in college admissions			1
@entity1 's 1950 case produced a landmark court ruling that set the stage for the eventual end of racial segregation in public facilities			1
the question around @entity2 could come down to whether a majority believes affirmative action has run its course , no longer necessary in a country that has come far to confront its racially divisive past			1
" there 's a good chance that affirmative action , at least in the case of education , is on the chopping block , " said @entity43 , a @entity44 appellate attorney and @entity46 editor			1
@entity53 selected quotes from arguments " the @entity10 10 years ago approved the use of race as a factor			1
but it 's just changed			0
[ now retired justice ] @entity61 is n't there and she was the decisive vote			0
and the current conservative majority is just very suspicious of the use of race in government decision - making , " @entity43 said			1
specifically in @entity2 , do race - conscious admission policies at the @entity3 , the flagship state college , violate the rights of white applicants ? other , similar cases on docket the timing of the decision is not lost on the justices			1
the court is also set to rule by month 's end on two other contentious appeals over classification -- voting rights enforcement , and same - sex marriage			1
@entity2 sued the state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in @entity85 , @entity86 , outside @entity87			0
she claims the individualized , discretionary admission policies violate her rights , and favor @entity25 and @entity91 applicants over whites and @entity93			1
the state of @entity86 provides for a hybrid admission policy : automatic acceptance to its university 's main campus in @entity99 for in - state students finishing in the top 10 percent of their high school class			1
three quarters of the in - state student body gets in this way , which ensures a measure of non-subjective diversity			2
@entity2 just missed that opportunity , so she had to compete in a separate pool of students seeking to attend the highly competitive school			2
it is that a selection process that is before the court			0
" if any state action should respect racial equality , it is university admissions , " she and her lawyers told the high court in their written brief			1
" selecting those who will benefit from the limited places available at universities has enormous consequences			0
" the school , with a large 52,000 student body , defends the educational benefits of its " holistic " policy of considering race as one of many factors -- including test scores , community service , leadership and work experience -- designed to create a diverse campus			2
" we must have the flexibility to consider each applicant 's unique experiences and background so we can provide the best environment in which to educate and train the students who will be our nation 's future leaders , " said school administrators			2
a summary of major upcoming @entity10 decisions @entity150 administration backs school the @entity150 administration agrees , and is backing the school , saying to grow a nation built on differing complexions and backgrounds will depend on future leaders " who possess the understanding of diversity that is necessary to govern and defend the @entity159			1
" the @entity160 is among more than five dozen outside groups that filed legal briefs in support of the school			2
many of them worry the conservative high court majority is poised to strike down or severely limit affirmative action			1
" a broad ruling could have very far reaching effects and could possibly affect the pathway to opportunity for minority students at a range of universities , " said @entity168 , the group 's special counsel			1
" not just at state universities , but at all institutions of higher education			0
" but groups opposed to the state 's policies think the time has come to rethink how affirmative action will be applied in the future , if at all			1
" using race in admissions decisions , to achieve diversity , amounts to stereotyping people by their race , " said @entity186 of the conservative @entity187 , which filed a legal brief in support of @entity2			1
" racial diversity in a student body does not guarantee a diversity of experience and perspectives			0
it is unrealistic and wrong to try to pigeonhole people by their race			2
" a bigger debate a larger social debate is whether race - conscious policies serve their ultimate purpose -- to help minority students ultimately achieve success , especially in high - profile professional positions			1
" what we 're seeing now is affirmative action is backfiring quite badly , " said @entity210 , a law professor at the @entity211 and a member of the @entity213			1
she and two fellow @entity218 members filed a brief , citing recent studies that race preferences are doing more harm than good , and suggesting there are fewer @entity25 professionals than would have been with race - neutral methods			1
" the problem is what is called mismatch , " said @entity210			0
" as a result of affirmative action , black students in particular , @entity91 students as well , are likely to go to a school where their entering credentials put them towards the bottom of the entering class , " at top schools like @entity240 or @entity86			1
their lower grades as a result , said @entity210 , means those students are much more likely to give up on the ambition to major in science , or go into medicine or the law			2
many social scientists and civil groups , including the @entity160 , reject that analysis			2
" i think those studies and arguments do n't really jive with the real world , " said @entity168			0
" the admissions officers are best situated to make the determination and some of the tradeoffs , to have a mix of students that can accomplish all of the things that college and universities are engines to do			1
" the high court has had an evolving record on the discretion of state officials to decide who attends their institutions			0
the justices said in 2003 that state universities can narrowly tailor their admissions policies to consider an applicant 's race , to achieve a " critical mass " of minority students			1
but they reaffirmed existing limits -- bans on the use of quotas , extra " race " points in selective criteria , or " balancing " measures to reflect the larger population			1
that landmark case from the @entity287 is the subject of a separate pending high court case over a state ballot measure designed to eliminate any racial criteria			0
a divided federal appeals court had concluded the voter - approved ban on " preferential treatment " at public colleges and universities was unconstitutional , and " alters @entity298 's political structure by impermissibly burdening racial minorities			0
" the justices have accepted that case for review , and will hold oral arguments in the fall			0
it has the potential to complement , or surpass in impact , the separate @entity2 case			0
but her appeal is complicated by the issue of " standing " and whether @entity2 should even be allowed to bring her lawsuit			0
@entity2 graduated from another school she graduated last spring from @entity314 , where she went after being rejected by the @entity3 -- and school officials had argued she has no " live " controversy or claim necessary for the high court to intervene			0
they said her only " harm " would be trying to recoup nonrefundable application fees			0
through her lawyers , @entity2 said she did not want to be interviewed separately by @entity0			0
but after october 's argument she told reporters , " i hope the court rules that a student 's race and ethnicity should not be considered when applying to the @entity3			0
" in hearing the case , the high court made no mention of whether the standing issue would affect its ultimate ruling			1
another wildcard : justice @entity334 will not participate in the case since she apparently had been briefed on the issue as the @entity150 administration 's solicitor general , before joining the high court			0
that leaves the possibility of a 4 - 4 ruling , meaning @entity2 would not prevail , but leaving undecided the larger constitutional questions presented			1
the @entity3 proudly touts its diversity : the most recent freshman class is about 46 percent white , 25 percent @entity91 , 18 percent @entity93 , and 5 percent @entity25			0
some states , including @entity347 , do not allow race considerations in college admissions			2
the issue now before an arguably more conservative high court is whether the @entity86 policies should be re-evaluated , as states have had nearly a decade to re-evaluate such diversity considerations			2
impact of @entity1 a final word about @entity1			0
when the @entity87 mailman applied to the @entity3 in 1946 , no @entity25 at the time could be admitted to any law school in the state , and there were even no black - only law schools			0
school administrators cited the established white - only policies for their rejection and instead offered @entity1 an out - of - state scholarship			1
he refused and took his case to court			0
the high court unanimously found in favor of @entity1 and he became the first @entity25 ever ordered admitted to an all - white institution			2
his legal victory was an important legal landmark -- a building block that culminated three years later in the 1953 @entity376 case , where the justices ordered a permanent end to state - mandated public , racial segregation			1
@entity1 's personal victory was bittersweet			0
he entered the @entity3 law school , but later dropped out , following ill health as well as hostility from white classmates			0
he died in 1982 , and the @entity387 civil courthouse in @entity99 was renamed in his honor			0
the current case is @entity390 ( 11 - 345 )			2
court transcript audio recording of arguments			0

@entity10 looks at case asking if admissions policies violate rights of white applicants
some groups worry conservative majority will strike down or severely limit affirmative action
a larger debate is whether race - conscious policies serve their ultimate purpose of helping minority students
decision could come in coming days as part of busy end to @entity10 term
