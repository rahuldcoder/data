i get all the @entity4 jokes			1
i totally agree it is causing many of us already stressed - out moms to feel like we are in constant competition to throw the perfect birthday party , make the perfect school snack and take the perfect family photo			1
and yet , i will totally own the fact that i am a @entity4 mom			1
i threw my daughter , @entity14 , a superhero party for her 6th birthday and made everything by hand			2
i create whimsical @entity19 costumes			2
i make occasion - appropriate snacks			2
i do not do this to bolster my flagging ego or to one - up my fellow moms			2
i do this because , as a special - needs mom , there are a lot of " mom " things i am not			1
my second daughter , @entity30 , was born with the neurological disorders lissencephaly and microcephaly			2
@entity32 means " smooth brain " and microcephaly means " small head			0
" what this means is that while she was in utero , her brain stopped developing , due to a random miswriting of her genetic code			0
now almost 4 , she is cognitively still a newborn			0
she can not hold up her own head , she eats through a gastronomy tube in her stomach , she requires oxygen support when she sleeps and she can not control her own body temperature			0
she has quadripalegic cerebral palsy , is legally blind and has severe epilepsy			0
it is unsafe to have her outside in all but the most optimum weather conditions , and it 's risky to bring her around crowds of people and all their germs			0
because of this , my older daughter , 6 - year - old @entity14 , spends a lot more time at home than many of her peers			1
there are a lot of things @entity14 does n't get to do			2
i am not a " let 's join the traveling soccer team and spend hours every week on the road " mom			0
i 'm not a " do every activity you want as long as you get your schoolwork done " mom			0
i am not a " playdates every weekend " mom , a " spectator at every event " mom or a " spontaneous family trip " mom			0
" ( hell , i 'm not even a " well - planned vacation " mom			2
) depending on @entity30 's health , i 'm not even a " tuck you into bed every night " mom			0
i have forgotten to send my daughter to school in a jersey on sports day , i have missed sign - ups for things , and i have said no to classes @entity14 wants to take because i can not possibly get her there every week			1
when @entity30 was 6 months old and @entity14 was 3 , a friend sent me an " invitation " to join @entity4			1
it was like opening the golden gates to never - ending possibilities for the trapped - at - home mom i so often was ! while i have always considered myself passably crafty , what i am not is wildly creative			1
and there it was : the ultimate guide to the perfect childhood ! ok , i admit that 's overstating it a little bit , but i was a desperate , terrified , newly inducted special - needs mom with a bored , over-active toddler on my hands			1
armed with endless ideas and step - by - step instructions , i could create wonderful memories with @entity114 despite rarely leaving home			1
the thing many people do n't realize about being the parent of a special - needs child is that , for those of us who also have kids without disabilities , it is usually their well - being and future that cause us the greatest heartache			1
@entity30 has never wanted for a thing in her short life			0
it is @entity14 who never has two parents at her side on outings , or may never get that trip to @entity133 she so desperately wants			0
@entity14 knows that only one parent will be there for her school events			0
we are the family with only one parent in the stands at sporting events and one parent in the audience for dance recitals			0
in @entity30 's case , she is so susceptible to getting ill that it just is n't safe for her to be in a crowd			2
@entity14 's father and sister were not at her last birthday party because it was outside in the july heat , which @entity30 can not manage			0
@entity14 does have to pay the price for having a special - needs sibling			1
my typical child breaks my heart much more frequently than my special - needs child			1
the needs of my second child restrict the movement most parents of young children are used to in their lifestyle , and that affects both my children			2
it is for @entity14 that i have to get creative in the ways i create memories			1
it can be really hard not having the time to be the mom i would like to be			0
but the one thing i do do ? i spend a lot of time at home			2
@entity30 's fragile health means she lives in a virtual bubble a lot of the time			0
i might not be able to run @entity14 around doing fun activities and having experiences outside the home , but i can create fun and memories inside the home			1
@entity14 helps me with most of my @entity4 - inspired activities			1
it allows us to bond and express our creative energy			0
it allows me to contribute something meaningful to her childhood beyond hospitals and therapists and holding the suction wand for her sister			0
so please , do n't take it as a challenge when my daughter and i make her teacher 's end - of - the - year gift			1
i 'm just using what i have so my daughter has one thing about which she can say , " hey , my mom does that ! " do you use @entity4 as a parenting tool ? share your experiences in the comments section below .			1

@entity209 discovered @entity4 when her daughters were 6 months and 3 years old
