-- in " @entity3 , " @entity2 ' bad - boy cop @entity1 may not play by the rules , but the film sure does			1
@entity2 , second from left , and @entity7 are shifty cops in " @entity3			1
" the movie is textbook @entity10			1
directed by @entity13 , who wrote " @entity18 " and directed " @entity17 , " from a script that originated with " @entity16 " novelist @entity15 , it 's a story both men have told before and will doubtless return to again			1
too bad that story -- the one about the constant struggle with an impure world , betrayal , disillusionment , retribution , all that jazz -- is n't told with much originality this time around			0
as @entity27 , a detective with a special @entity30 vice squad , @entity2 shoots first and asks questions much , much later			1
in his field the bad guys are easy to spot , and if @entity1 has to get his hands dirty , well , then he 'll be careful to wipe away the residue before he calls it in			0
he works from the gut			0
we have @entity27 's number from the beginning : he wakes up , vomits , cleans his gun , and knocks back a couple of miniature bottles of vodka			1
then he crashes a kidnappers ' den and puts down four gangsters before they know what 's hit them			2
" do n't worry , " he tells the distraught little girls caged up in the back			0
" i 'm a cop			2
" it 's probably superfluous to add that he 's still nursing a grievous hangover from the wife who died in flagrante with a person unknown two or three years ago			2
it 's also probably superfluous to mention that @entity56 ( headed by @entity57 ) is beginning to sniff around @entity27 's unit			2
in particular , @entity56 is talking to his ex-partner @entity59 ( @entity61 ) , a revelation that sends @entity27 reaching for his baseball bat			0
before he can put @entity59 straight , though , his old pal is gunned down before his eyes by a couple of punks			0
can @entity27 cover up his own potentially incriminating presence at the scene and still track down the cop killers ? hell , yes , even if he has to alienate everyone in the department before he 's through			1
@entity2 does n't do much " acting " as such , but he does n't need to : his performance is clean and spare , in synch with @entity77 's clipped economy , and he has a doleful quality that goes some way to redeem a nasty and wretchedly na√Øve character			1
alcoholism does n't appear to have thrown off @entity27 's aim any , but it must have dulled his reasoning			2
a broody , intuitive detective should be able to piece together this boilerplate mystery without too much head - scratching , but @entity27 never stops to look even two steps ahead			0
( i guess he 's not a @entity15 fan			2
) but what he lacks in insight he makes up for in sheer determination , not to say blood - lust			0
in a neat touch , when it 's time to cool off his public profile for a spell , the rogue cop is transferred to a desk in the complaints department -- surely his idea of purgatory , and , obviously , an utterly pointless occupation			1
@entity7 boosts the energy level as @entity27 's paternalistic mentor , boss , and no. 1 fan : " you 're the tip of the spear , " he tells him			0
" who else is going to hold back the animals ? " violent and cynical and a shade or two overdetermined , " @entity3 " ably demonstrates the pitfalls embedded in the pragmatics of " a necessary evil , " or anyone who sets himself up as a law unto himself , but ultimately it ca n't conceive of a better alternative			1
after all , the rest is politics , a game that even the most hard - boiled anti-hero would never lower himself to enter			0
and , besides , he 's seen it before			0
" @entity3 " is rated r and runs 107 minutes			1
for @entity128 's take , click here			0

" @entity3 " has been done better before , says @entity0 's @entity133
movie stars @entity2 as rogue cop who finds self in *awkward* position
film is *adequate* , but no *surprises* for those who *'ve* seen " @entity18 "
