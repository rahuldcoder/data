-- if it was n't already clear that @entity3 is done legislating this year , the scene inside and outside the @entity2 on wednesday illustrated that the midterm elections are in full swing			1
just before the @entity8 began authorizing the @entity10 lawsuit against president @entity11 , @entity7 @entity6 gathered on the @entity13 steps just below the room where that hearing was to take place to unveil their " middle class jump start " agenda			1
with their dueling messages , they hoped to energize their respective political bases and propel supporters to the polls in november			1
the @entity10 decision to sue @entity11 over delaying the @entity27 employer mandate puts the politically - charged health care law -- an issue that motivates the most ardent @entity10 voters -- front and center			1
@entity7 @entity6 argued in offering their middle class initiative that @entity10 priorities in @entity3 were skewed toward wealthy special interests at the expense of working families			1
standing in front of sizable red white and blue convention - style placards with the phrases " women succeed , " " @entity45 " and " make it in @entity46 , " @entity39 chairman @entity38 tried to contrast the two political parties			0
" you can either sue the president of the @entity46 , or you can do your job here at the @entity7 and pass laws that help the middle class and working families , " the @entity49 @entity48 said			1
citing the @entity10 lawsuit as a factor affecting the midterms , @entity56 @entity55 in a wednesday interview in the @entity58 set an ambitious goal of picking up 25 seats in the @entity7			2
democrats would need to take back 17 seats to regain control , a feat most @entity6 concede is n't likely , especially in the sixth year of @entity11 's presidency			1
that 's when a president 's party historically loses seats			0
@entity73 : dear speaker @entity74 : do your job instead midterm focus for @entity6 : women congressional democrats on both sides of the @entity2 are directing much of their message toward women , who they view as the critical voting bloc			1
@entity11 won re-election in 2012 with support from 55 % of women compared to 44 % for @entity10 nominee @entity87			1
in an off - year congressional election , @entity6 know they ca n't expect the same turnout			1
but they 're talking about child care , contraception coverage , and education to maximize their chances			0
@entity6 unveiled their " 100 day action plan " on wednesday , pledging to hold votes on bills focusing on women , if they win back the @entity7			2
those measures would be targeted at raising the minimum wage , ensuring equal pay for equal work , and boosting access to early childhood education			0
" our agenda for women and families is ' when women succeed , @entity109 , ' " @entity55 said			0
this is not just the title of our agenda			0
this is a statement of absolute fact			0
and our agenda presents a stark contrast to what the @entity10 have done to roll back women 's rights and limit women 's opportunities			1
" women 's work : the @entity10 's glass ceiling dems in the @entity123 in the @entity123 , @entity6 seized on the @entity125 's big @entity27 decision last month that employers of some for - profit companies were not required to provide insurance plans that covered contraception if they opposed on religious grounds			1
a @entity6 bill to reverse that decision was blocked this week			2
but the @entity6 narrative on the @entity125 fits with what many in the party have labeled a @entity10 " war on women			1
" @entity55 and other @entity6 emphasized that decision was made by " five men " who were effectively dictating whether or not women could get access to contraceptives			2
' over and over again ' " this is 2014 , not 1914			0
most @entity46 thought this was settled long , long ago			0
but for some reason , @entity10 keep dragging us back here - over and over and over again , " sen. @entity146 of @entity147 said			2
but the @entity10 is positioned well to retake control of the @entity123 in november , and top @entity10 leaders recognized that the issue could damage their standing among women if they did n't respond			1
two female @entity10 senators -- @entity157 and @entity158 -- wrote an editorial on tuesday in the @entity160 arguing @entity6 were distorting the issue for political gain			1
" contrary to the misleading rhetoric , the @entity163 ruling does not take away women 's access to birth control			0
no employee is prohibited from purchasing any @entity170 approved drug or device , and contraception remains readily available and accessible for all women nationwide , " the two senators wrote			0
@entity123 @entity10 introduced their own counterproposal that would codify that no employer can block a woman 's access to @entity170 - approved contraception			1
@entity163 is the retail business that successfully appealed the contraception case			0
@entity125 women lash out at birth control decision a move to rally @entity10 base as the battle over a major women 's issue played out in the @entity123 , @entity7 @entity10 took their first step to approve a lawsuit arguing @entity11 violated the @entity191 by making changes to @entity27 on his own instead of allowing @entity3 to act			1
@entity8 chairman @entity193 presided over a hearing with legal experts , and insisted the @entity10 move to sue was not about politics , but about protecting the authority of the legislative branch			2
" the separated powers between these branches are there in order to ensure that no one person would trample on the rights of others , " the @entity200 @entity10 said			2
" my fear is that our nation is currently facing the exact threat that the @entity191 is designed to avoid			0
branches of government have always attempted to exert their influence on other branches , but the president , in my opinion , has gone too far , " sessions added			0
but the top @entity48 on the committee , rep. @entity220 , was n't buying it			0
the suit was being " used to appease members of the @entity10 who will not rest until president @entity11 is charged with articles of impeachment , " she said			1
" this is a partisan , political stunt , timed to peak in the @entity7 in november right as the midterm elections are happening			2
" motivating voters but both sides believe the suit will motivate voters			0
the @entity232 released web ads on wednesday targeting 21 @entity10 incumbents and challengers with this message -- " tell republicans : do n't use our taxpayer dollars for your frivolous lawsuit			2
" as the hearing was about to start , the @entity7 @entity10 's campaign arm tweeted an " urgent " message urging supporters to sign an online petition with this : " @entity247 as they protect your constitutional liberties and the country from continued executive abuse			0
" the message was another tool for the campaign committee to gather names and contract information to help solicit money to support their candidates			0
despite the argument by @entity10 candidates that @entity11 and his party are failing a competency test on a range of issues from the economy to the immigration crisis at the @entity269 border , @entity27 is still a foundation of their campaigns			1
@entity10 candidates are expected to run ads focusing on the health law they despise , targeting specific problems voters in their districts are experiencing with it , such as cuts to a popular @entity281 program			0
@entity282 : the @entity283 of @entity46 politics			0

campaigning for midterm election is in full swing
democrats and @entity10 aim to appeal to respective political bases
