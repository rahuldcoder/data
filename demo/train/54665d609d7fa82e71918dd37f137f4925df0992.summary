the world 's getting hotter , the sea 's rising and there 's increasing evidence neither are naturally occurring phenomena			0
so says a report from the @entity7 , a document released every six years that is considered the benchmark on the topic			1
more than 800 authors and 50 editors from dozens of countries took part in its creation			0
the summary for policymakers was released early friday , while the full report , which bills itself as " a comprehensive assessment of the physical science basis of climate change , " will be distributed monday			1
other reports , including those dealing with vulnerability and mitigation , will be released next year			0
here are the highlights from friday 's summary : man - made climate change is almost certain climate scientists are 95 % confident -- that is to say , surer than ever -- that humans are responsible for at least " half of the observed increase in global average surface temperatures since the 1950s			1
" this is the major headline from the report , as it marks a stark spike in confidence over the last 12 years , as scientists were 90 % confident in 2007 and 66 % confident in 2001 of the same conclusion			1
an increase in carbon dioxide concentrations that is " unprecedented " in the last 20,000 years , along with increases in other emissions , have driven up average temperatures by about 0.6 degrees @entity48 ( 1 @entity49 ) since 1950 , the report states			2
worst - case predictions are that by 2100 , temperatures could increase by as much as 3.7 degrees @entity53 ) , the report says			0
climate change is already affecting extreme weather since 1950 we 've seen a dramatic increase in extreme weather			1
this is especially true of record heat and heavier precipitation events			0
while it 's difficult to determine the exact role climate change plays in an individual event , such as @entity65 or the @entity67 tornado that struck @entity68 , @entity69 , because there are so many ingredients necessary to brew a single storm , the links are clearer when you look at overall patterns			1
according to a study released this month in the @entity77 , scientists found strong links between global warming and extreme weather around the globe in 2012			1
among the 2012 events were the july heat wave in the northeastern and north - central @entity83 , the spring heat wave in the eastern @entity83 , the @entity86 drought , the winter drought in @entity88 and @entity89 and the heavy rains and flooding in @entity92			0
according to a paper in the journal nature , this year , weather events that have previously been classified as " storms of the century " could become the storm of " every 20 years or less			2
" " climate change will probably increase storm intensity and size simultaneously , resulting in a significant intensification of storm surges , " the paper said			1
the last 30 - year period is " very likely " the warmest in the last 800 years scientists are 90 % sure that 1981 - 2010 was the warmest such span in the last eight centuries , and there 's a 66 % chance that it was the warmest 30 - year period in the last 1,400 years			2
while the last 15 years have not warmed as quickly , we 've seen steady warming over most of the globe , and we have n't seen a below - average temperature month since february 1985			0
scientists are also 99 % certain that we will see more hot days and nights -- and fewer chilly ones -- as the 21st century progresses			0
" @entity116 of the last three decades has been significantly warmer than all preceding decades since 1850 , " according to the @entity118 report			2
to give you an idea of how the @entity124 has heated up , the combined land and ocean temperature increased by about 0.8 degrees @entity53 between 1901 and 2010 , yet between 1979 and 2010 , the temperature spiked about 0.5 degrees @entity48			0
sea level rise will increase due to warming oceans and loss of ice better climate models give scientists more confidence that sea level rise will accelerate in the 21st century			2
scientists are 99 % sure that sea level rise has accelerated over the last 2 centuries at a rate higher than at any time in the last 2,000 years			2
they 're also highly confident that if the global surface temperature increases by more than 2 degrees @entity53 over present temperatures we could see " a nearly ice - free @entity139 in late summer			0
" the report further notes that there is increasing evidence that ice sheets are losing mass , glaciers are shrinking , @entity139 sea ice cover is diminishing , snow cover is decreasing and permafrost is thawing in the @entity150			0
as for the rise in sea level , scientists asserted in the @entity118 report that tide gauges and satellite data make it " unequivocal " that the world 's mean sea level is on the upswing			1
even if we end emission tomorrow , climate change could continue for centuries this may be one of the more harrowing findings in the report , as it suggests we 're too far gone to effect any meaningful change in our lifetimes			1
even if we end carbon dioxide emissions today , effects could linger for hundreds , if not thousands , of years			1
and certain changes may already be irreversible			0
" many aspects of climate change will persist for centuries even if concentrations of greenhouse gases are stabilized			1
this represents a multicentury commitment created by human activities today , " the report states .			0

scientists surer than ever humans play major role in climate change , report says
global warming already affecting extreme weather , and it could get worse , report says
@entity7 's @entity118 *convenes* every six years to put together report ; it 's considered benchmark on topic
even if emissions ended today , effects of climate change could linger for centuries
