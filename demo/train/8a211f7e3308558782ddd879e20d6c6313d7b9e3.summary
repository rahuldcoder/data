-- the scoreboard was clear			2
winner : 11 - year - old @entity3 , " @entity4 " ( the golden horseman ) who became a national story after he sang the national anthem at @entity9 of the @entity11 playoff series between the @entity12 and @entity13 and showed a lot of a talent , heart and class			1
losers : the haters and racists who -- displaying a lot of ignorance -- hid behind the anonymity of @entity25 to spew venom and attack the little guy because they thought that no one dressed in a mariachi outfit was certified @entity30 enough to sing " @entity31			1
" here 's a sample : " this lil @entity34 snuck in the country like 4 hours ago now he 's singing the anthem " -- @entity38 " who dat lil @entity40 sangin the national anthem at the @entity44 game ? ? ? ? " -- @entity45 " ca n't believe they had the nerve to have a beaner sing the national anthem of america # smh " -- @entity51 " is this the @entity31 or the @entity52 ? get this lil kid out of here " -- @entity55 " so illegal aliens can sing @entity57 @ games now ? " -- @entity59 what does it mean to be an @entity30 anyway ? here 's a quiz : on one hand , you have someone who goes before a national audience and shows his love for a country where dreams come true			1
on the other , you have an angry mob filled with hatred and racism that , cloaked in the anonymity of @entity25 , spews invective at a child			2
now , which do you think represents what it means to be an @entity30 ? who do you want to claim ? and who would you send packing ? the @entity30 looks out for the powerless , the downtrodden and the oppressed			1
our system of government --- a constitutional republic -- protects the minority because majorities can protect themselves			2
meanwhile , @entity91 took the high road			2
boy returns for @entity11 encore in mariachi suit " for those that said something bad about me , i understand it 's your opinion , " @entity3 told @entity0			1
" i 'm a proud @entity30 and live in a free country			1
it 's not hurting me			2
it 's just your opinion			2
" later , he discussed the backlash with reporters			0
" to be honest , " he said , " it 's just the people how they were raised			0
my father and my mother told me that you should never judge people by how they look			0
you should judge them on the inside			0
and the saying that i go by is never judge a book by its cover			0
" i do n't have that kind of self - restraint			2
when i hear stories like this , i get sad			0
then , i get enraged			0
i mean , enough is enough ! @entity91 is a @entity123 born in @entity124			1
that means he is part of a community that has -- since @entity128 , the @entity129 and the @entity130 in 1848 -- put up with more than 100 years of discrimination and mistreatment at the hands of those who consider themselves superior			0
even if , as the racist tweets show , they do n't always act in ways that convey this alleged sense of superiority			2
the part about @entity91 being @entity123 , as opposed to a @entity34 immigrant , is essential to the story			1
it 's a complicated road			0
" they do n't know my life , " he told reporters about his tormentors			0
" my father was actually in the @entity151 for a really long time ... people do n't know , they just assume that i 'm just @entity34			0
but i 'm not from @entity34			0
i 'm from @entity124 born and raised , a true @entity12 fan			1
" when @entity91 did an interview with @entity155 , the spanish - language network , he did it in @entity157			2
and this is what the nativists were worried about -- that @entity34 - @entity30 are not assimilating ? the next chapter will be where some @entity34 - @entity30 actually turn on @entity91 for appearing to distance himself from @entity34			1
if they do , they 'll look as silly as the nativists			0
the " distance " is already there			0
he 's not a @entity34			0
finally , thanks to the @entity12 -- and especially some good people in the front office -- a story that had many latinos , and other @entity30 , seething had a @entity175 ending			1
@entity91 was invited back to perform an encore of the national anthem at @entity178			1
flanked by @entity124 mayor @entity179 , and his wife @entity181 -- the boy returned to center stage and belted out an even stronger performance the second time around			2
i bet there was n't a dry eye in the arena			0
as for the haters , they did what bullies usually do when someone stands up to them			0
they ran and hid , disabling their @entity25 accounts or deleting their comments			0
for @entity91 , who was aware of the comments and the controversy but managed to stay above it , the call - back was n't political but personal			1
" to be invited back to sing the national anthem is just amazing because now i know the @entity12 like how i sing , " @entity3 said			1
" it makes me feel like i 'm doing something legendary			0
" the rest of us know that the encore was about more than the boy 's talent			1
the @entity12 is a classy outfit that boldly took a stand against bigotry and ignorance			1
it was the @entity30 thing to do			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			1

11 - year - old @entity123 who sang national anthem is *bashed* on *social* media
@entity215 : the boy is more @entity30 than his racist *critics*
he was invited back by the @entity12 and got *cheers* for his encore
