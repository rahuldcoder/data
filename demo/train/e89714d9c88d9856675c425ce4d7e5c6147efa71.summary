-- the @entity1 , ruling house of the @entity4 royal family , have endured world wars , personal tragedies and highly public scandals			1
in the 20th century , through moments of pain and joy , they provided the @entity4 people with a fixture of redoubtable comfort , an unchanging physical constitution in a world fraught with uncertainty			1
but how will the @entity4 royals face their greatest challenge -- maintaining relevance in the 21st century ? the new prince born to @entity22 , @entity23 , and her husband , prince @entity24 , will be a critical part of the answer			1
it may be true that the royal family remains ingrained at the heart of the @entity4 establishment			1
the title er ( @entity34 ) adorns the helmets of @entity4 police officers , the laws of @entity32 still require royal assent and the monarch remains technical head of the @entity4 armed forces			1
' wicked ' author : royal baby stands for hope next february , @entity45 will have worn the crown for 62 years			2
she 's 86 and her public appearances are becoming less frequent			2
@entity45 's reign will one day end			1
and without the princess who won hearts in war and then became a queen in peace , the royals will have to re-win the public 's affection			1
and they 'll have to do so by navigating a changing @entity4 society ; one more socially liberal and less predisposed to tradition			1
recent history suggests it wo n't be easy			0
consider the queen 's experience following princess @entity64 's death in 1997			1
facing intense pressure to show personal emotion in the face of a loss that was felt widely , the queen hesitated			1
public expectations conflicted with her conception of royal purpose , that of a stoic , unmovable figurehead			0
her inclination was to mourn in private , allowing the politicians to provide the public face of suffering			0
eventually though , realizing that times had changed , the @entity45 bent to the will of her people			0
she recognized the intrinsic truth of her throne , one that the future king , @entity24 , and his son ( the future king ) will also have to grasp : that their royal adornments of power exist subject to the grant of their @entity4 subjects			1
opinion : how to raise a royal baby ultimately , in an era increasingly defined by vigorous social entrepreneurship , institutional relevance is determined less by history , than by a perception of worth			1
it 's in this sense that change , the ability of the royals to evolve and find sustaining worth , will determine whether they rise or fall			2
so far , it seems that @entity24 gets this			0
when , on their wedding day , the future king and his wife drove down @entity106 in an open - topped @entity107 , the watching throngs reacted with elation			0
why such glee ? because the crowds perceived a royal interpretation of cool @entity113 ; both seemingly natural and delicately informal			0
a simple act hinting at the prospect of a modern monarchy			0
representatives to be proud of			0
where royals are regarded as living in an overly insulated bubble , major problems arise			0
just look at the outrage that has followed the recent outing of @entity125 ' ( next in line to the throne ) tax planning			0
for royalists then , it 's fortunate that the just - born prince defines royal change			1
he offers a royal family that is both necessarily distant and semi-relatable , an incarnation of royal tradition gelled to social modernity			1
in short , a prince for the present and a king for the future			0
but just as he 'll live without worldly want , the prince wo n't be afforded a normal life			0
opinion : why i would n't want to be royal baby as his parents and uncle have repeatedly found out , the media has little interest in royal privacy , especially for a royal destined to one day become monarch			2
just as the spotlights of the world fixed on his birth , so too will they follow him in life			0
that 's the price of modern royalty			2
and @entity4 history has begun its latest chapter			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			2

@entity168 : the @entity4 royal family is enduring ; can it maintain relevance in 21st century ?
he says how new royal parents , son *reflect* modern world to @entity178 is *key* to answer
when queen 's reign ends , will , @entity23 will need to show worth , be relatable but distant , he says
@entity168 : new prince is an incarnation of royal tradition gelled to social modernity
