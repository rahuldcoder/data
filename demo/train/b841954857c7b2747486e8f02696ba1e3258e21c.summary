since 1996 , photographer @entity0 has been working on her " @entity3 " project , using an old technique that is the basis of all photography to create complex , layered works			1
@entity0 puts her subjects in a dark space , covering the windows while leaving a small hole for the outside light to feed in			1
an inverted landscape -- with colors and depth preserved -- fills the room			2
this is the camera obscura technique , and it uses a naturally occurring phenomenon that led to the modern - day camera			1
most cameras , however , have an internal mirror that flips the image back to the position it appears in real life			0
@entity0 has used the technique for almost 20 years , taking photos of people in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
" they all have a documentary basis , i.e. they show how / where people live , how their interiors look and what they see from their windows , " @entity0 said			1
" but besides this ... because of the two worlds merging down to each other , a third ' reality ' is created and made visible			0
that reflects perhaps mostly my mental landscape , but i feel , at least a bit , ( it reflects ) also the landscape of the model 's mind			0
" before working with the technique , @entity0 had worked with pinhole cameras , which are essentially camera obscura on a smaller scale			1
light and color slide through a small hole to create an inverted image that is absorbed by light - sensitive paper			1
" both techniques are slow and unpredictable and compel one to slow down and stop amid the daily routine , " @entity0 said			2
" moreover , the actual process is crucial in both			0
they present a challenge to experiment and extend conventional photography			0
" social media follow @ @entity67 on @entity68 to join the conversation about photography			0
@entity0 decided to explore camera obscura after seeing black - and - white images by @entity72 in a magazine			1
she could n't find much information on this technique , and she had many trials before success			0
@entity0 now has about 70 images in her project			1
@entity0 chose models she knew -- students , friends , neighbors or random acquaintances -- though always " they are people who touch me in one way or other , " she said			2
@entity0 sets up a room alone , then invites the model into the space			1
together they find a place for the subject to pose that is comfortable for the model and aesthetically satisfying for @entity0			2
" it is a big pleasure for me to show and share this light phenomena with my model , " she said			0
@entity0 used color film when she first started the project and has since switched to digital			1
film exposures vary from minutes to hours , and digital exposures last anywhere from seconds to minutes , she said			0
regardless , models must hold a pose for a relatively long time for a picture to be taken in this space with low light			0
" darkness and long exposures create the contemplative atmosphere and let us enjoy and be inside the magic world which appears in an ordinary room for a while , " @entity0 said			2
light is the most important factor in photography , @entity0 said , and camera obscura attracted her because of its play with light			1
" i feel that the light is my home , " she said			0
" that is why i am a photographer			0
" @entity0 is a photographer based in @entity30 .			2

@entity0 used the camera obscura technique for her " @entity3 " photo project
the technique uses a naturally occurring phenomenon that is the basis for the modern - day camera
the subjects are in a dark room , but what 's outside is reflected on them via a small hole in the window
