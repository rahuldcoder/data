the @entity0 vividly remembers he was so stoned out of his mind at that mahogany - laden restaurant with the imposing edifice , while savoring a bottle of 1945 @entity6 , running up a $ 30,000 tab in one night			1
after all , it was just dinner			0
in the 1990s , @entity10 was already the self - proclaimed king of the world , raking in nearly a million dollars a week , all the while fashioning himself an ultra-hip , white @entity15 - driving @entity14 from @entity16			1
and then there were the women			0
the real ' @entity0 ' on @entity20 's portrayal throw in a steady stream of salaciousness with stunning strippers and call girls , ungodly quantities of @entity26 , cocaine and assorted excesses that rivaled @entity29 and you have something close to describing @entity10 's life			1
or what was his life			0
" once i scuba dived on four quaaludes and passed out at the bottom of the ocean , you know , 60 feet under , and somehow made it up alive , " he recalled in a 2008 interview with a degree of both relish and self - loathing			2
these days , the hoopla is on land			0
the three - hour @entity48 - directed epic based on @entity10 's life and bestselling book , " @entity51 of @entity52 , " premieres on december 25			1
if you are looking for a @entity56 morality tale , this is n't it			0
the real king of the world , @entity20 , portrays @entity10			1
photos : @entity60 takes on @entity52 the film , which also stars @entity62 and @entity63 , portrays @entity10 's world and the people who worked for him in what was a fraudulent stock enterprise			1
@entity10 's then - wife @entity67 , who he calls " @entity68 " in his book , is played by @entity70			1
@entity10 's millions were based on a huge lie , a massive " pump and dump " stock scheme at the firm he started called @entity75			1
it was n't on @entity52 , but in @entity78 on @entity79			0
along the way , it was the firm 's outrageous office antics and parties that would cement the legend of @entity10			1
in more than 2Â½ hours of home videos obtained by @entity87 from a 1991 party in the @entity89 and another on his yacht , @entity10 appears downright giddy , reminiscent of one of his favorite movie characters , @entity93 from the film " @entity52			1
" addressing the throngs of @entity96 at the 1991 party , @entity10 declares , " and i make one more guarantee			1
six months from now , what you 're doing right now is going to be nothing again			2
ok , that 's the bottom line			2
the guys who are doing 200 , will be doing 400 , the guys doing 400 will be doing 600			0
and they 'll still be one guy that is going to break that million dollar for the month			0
" the real ' @entity0 ' sounds off on the film looking back on those parties , @entity10 told us in 2008 , " on @entity52 , it 's like boom			1
you just jump to the top of the heap and it 's just mind - boggling , and that 's what really turned me on			1
and then of course , you know the thousand - dollar suits , the gold watches and the drinking at lunch , and the cocaine at the end of the day			2
... it was almost like adult @entity129 for dysfunctional people			0
" in other words , instant gratification			0
" was sleeping with a hooker about the instant gratification of sex ? no. i think for me it was probably more about power			0
and i think , it 's more about status on @entity52			2
... i got very little enjoyment from that whole , you know , prostitution thing			0
" greed as @entity10 knew it , he says , is not good			2
" the greed 's good to a point until it reverses on you and makes you into a monster			0
you know , there were times i look back at the way i acted and some of the things i did -- i was a monster			0
