-- if you 're reading this somewhere in @entity3 , then perhaps you should thank @entity4			1
the @entity6 professor is known as " @entity3 's father of the internet , " a web pioneer who helped establish some of the continent 's first online connections			1
for some 20 years now , soft - spoken @entity4 has been at the forefront of web development across @entity3			1
he is the first @entity3 to be elected to the board of @entity16 , the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers			1
he 's also played an important part in launching the @entity21 and @entity22 , the @entity3 internet numbers registry			1
as a result , @entity4 was recently inducted into the @entity25 , lauded as an instrumental figure " in the early design and development of the internet			1
" he is today chairman of @entity6 's information technology agency and a professor at the country 's @entity32			1
@entity0 's @entity34 spoke to @entity4 about the role of the internet in @entity3 's development and his dreams for the continent 's digital future			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : how did you get the title of father of the internet in @entity3 ? @entity4 : actually i do n't know , but perhaps i made a lot of effort to get my colleagues to understand and to participate and to begin to contribute to the internet			1
and i have been fortunate with a very good educational background and so i also wanted to impart the knowledge and i was a major contributor in building some of the important technical institutions that make up the internet ecosystem in @entity3			1
in the process of doing that a lot of people perhaps felt that my leadership was good for them , and you might say , gave me that kind of description			0
@entity0 : what is the state of the internet in the continent ? @entity69 : the health of the internet in @entity3 is good ; we have good connectivity , at least to major capital cities ; we also have good wireless through the mobile companies and other forms of connectivity , so connectivity is becoming less of a barrier , except that we are still working on the affordability side of that connectivity			2

we do n't have many businesses developing content or hosting content or doing e-commerce -- we have some banks trying to do internet banking , meaning we having companies beginning to adopt it , but we really have n't taken hold of it			2
some of it may be because of inadequate policies , because our policies historically have been about the transmission side of things and so we need to take another look at how a country thinks about developing its internet			0
so we have a big challenge -- actually , we see it as an opportunity			0
connectivity is not the problem , now it 's shifting to the industry and we need to really build strong industries that will serve the needs of the one billion people in @entity3			0
read this : tech hub working on ' @entity121 's next big idea ' @entity0 : do @entity3 governments understand the need for connectivity ? @entity69 : i think governments now do understand ; for most governments it 's important			0
they may not know what they want to do with it , but they understand it 's very important			0
that sometimes explains why government actions are seen as not coordinated or erratic , because they think it 's very important but they yet do n't have a full , sufficient understanding to know exactly how they want to interact with it or manage it or grow it			0
but certainly they recognize it is very important and many in governments are engaging with the internet technical community and other multi-stakeholder organizations to support them to evolve			0
read this : @entity153 takes on @entity154 ' we do understand that usually policy lags behind technology , so some of these sorts of conflicts would occur , but i think we have weathered the storm -- @entity3 is going beyond those days and now recognizes the importance of it			0
they are battling with controlling it , and soon we 'll convince everyone that there is no need and that the right thing to do is to discipline it and begin to adopt it and make it do the right things for us and help define what @entity3 wants from the internet , which is not very obvious yet			2
@entity0 : what is your hope for @entity3 in the future ? @entity69 : my hope for @entity3 in the future is that @entity3 will own its portion of the internet			2
@entity3 should strive to participate on its own terms on the internet , not leave it to chance to be determined			2
@entity3 can indeed determine how it wants to play in the internet and @entity3 should ensure that it is able to create the right policy environment for the internet to grow .			0
