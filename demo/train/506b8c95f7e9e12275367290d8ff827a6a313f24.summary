-- in monday 's foreign policy debate , president @entity1 said former @entity4 gov. @entity3 had criticized his administration for being too tough against @entity6 and bringing a protectionist case at the @entity8			1
the statement : @entity1 cited a case in which the @entity6 " were flooding us " with cheap tires			1
" and we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout @entity17			0
i have to say that gov. @entity3 criticized me for being too tough in that tire case ; said this would n't be good for @entity17 workers and that it would be protectionist , " @entity1 said			1
@entity0 @entity23 : @entity3 , @entity1 and @entity24 the facts : in 2009 , the @entity1 administration sought tariffs against @entity6 for dumping tires into the @entity17			1
the @entity8 upheld the tariffs			0
on its website , @entity3 's campaign cites where the @entity32 candidate addressed the case in his 2010 book " no apology			1
" " president @entity1 's action to defend @entity17 tire companies from foreign competition may make good politics by repaying unions for their support of his campaign , but it is decidedly bad for the nation and our workers , " @entity3 said			1
" the result was indeed inherently protectionist , according to @entity51 , vice president for studies at the @entity53			0
" it means it will raise prices for @entity17 consumers on tires , both domestic and imported , " @entity51 said			0
but the case was a minor one in the overall scheme of things , he added			0
both sides have engaged in such symbolic activity , " but neither is willing to take action that would seriously affect economic relations between our two economies , " he added			0
@entity0 @entity23 : comparing costs of @entity24 , @entity69 missions the subject of @entity6 has been raised over and over during the campaign , with each candidate accusing the @entity6 of stealing @entity17 jobs through unfair trade practices			1
in broad terms , both men offered similar views , even using some of the same language : " @entity6 is both an adversary , but also a potential partner in the international community if it 's following the rules , " @entity1 said			1
" so my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that @entity6 plays by the same rules as everybody else			1
" " they 're making some progress ; they need to make more , " said @entity3 , who vowed to label @entity6 a currency manipulator on his first day as president			1
" they have to understand we want to trade with them			0
we want a world that 's stable			0
we like free enterprise , but you got to play by the rules			0
" first , has @entity6 really stolen @entity17 jobs ? the numbers say yes			1
since @entity6 entered the @entity8 in 2001 , the @entity17 trade deficit with @entity6 " eliminated or displaced more than 2.7 million @entity17 jobs , " according to a report published in august by the @entity103 , a left - of - center think tank			2
the primary category from which jobs have been lost has been in the manufacturing sector			0
the candidates have complained because , while the @entity17 allows the free market , in large part , to dictate how much a dollar is worth and how much people will be paid in the @entity17 , @entity6 uses its power to keep wages low			2
@entity0 @entity23 : @entity1 's apology tour ? so , while the @entity116 says the average employer has to pay about $ 35 per hour in salary and benefits to hire a worker on a production line , a @entity6 factory pays only about $ 1.36 per hour for the same work			1
in response , many companies have moved jobs to @entity6 to take advantage of the lower wages			2
consequently , @entity6 products tend to be cheaper to buy all over the world			2
the result has been that @entity6 exports to the @entity17 have soared in recent years , while @entity17 exports to @entity6 have lagged far behind			2
what can a @entity17 president do about that ? probably not much			0
if the @entity17 were to raise trade barriers , @entity6 could do the same			2
if the @entity17 were to forbid @entity17 - based companies from shipping jobs to @entity6 , that might leave @entity17 companies less competitive in the world market			2
and if @entity6 were to say it is no longer interested in buying @entity17 debt , that could make it harder for the @entity17 government to borrow the money it needs to operate			0
the conclusion : in the tire case above , @entity1 is correct in his characterization of @entity3 's position			1
in the larger case of what to do about @entity17 - @entity6 relations , both candidates have promised to get tough			1
but that will hardly be the last word			0
