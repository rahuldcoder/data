@entity0 is @entity2 's equivalent to @entity4 's @entity3 or @entity6 's @entity5 and it is now the epicenter of demonstrations triggered by construction plans for a shopping center in one of the city 's few remaining green spaces			1
what was initially a small sit - in has morphed into a major series of protests due to -- in the words of @entity21 prime minister @entity20 -- " excessive force " by the police			1
@entity24 : thousands of protesters tear - gassed in @entity26 these protests reflect , in part , the deep ideological polarization between secular , liberal - minded @entity21 , and the more religious @entity21 , representing a quarter and two - thirds of the population respectively based on the 2011 general election results			1
many secular @entity21 complainthat the @entity34 - rooted government is intolerant of criticism and the diversity of lifestyles			2
so far , @entity20 's robust and muscular stance vis - Ã  - vis the demonstrators has reinforced those perceptions			2
a typical example cited by detractors is the government 's recent enactment of tight restrictions on the sale and promotion of alcohol even though the @entity21 government 's @entity49 estimates that only 6 percent of @entity21 households are alcohol drinkers			2
less than 1.5 percent of car accidents in 2012 were alcohol - related according to @entity21 economist @entity54			0
despite economic boom , @entity20 targeted by protests at the same time , critics are unhappy at the rapid pace of urbanization in @entity21 's metropolitan cities			1
@entity20 is planning to build a third airport , a third @entity63 bridge and a canal linking the @entity65 with the @entity66 , which are likely to destroy millions of trees and a delicate ecosystem in northern @entity2			1
a staggering $ 4.7 billion was spent on ambitious construction projects last year in @entity2 alone			0
given the litany of grievances and the confrontational nature of @entity21 politics , the raging protests come as no surprise			2
they coincide with a rapidly slowing economy that is likely to witness moderate growth rates at best for the foreseeable future without increased structural reforms			0
unfortunately , the @entity21 government is not expected to undertake major reform initiatives anytime soon , especially since the campaigning for the local and presidential elections in 2014 and the parliamentary elections in 2015 are already underway			0
despite the rising emotions sweeping @entity21 , this is not equivalent to the " @entity88 " that led to the toppling of former @entity91 president @entity90			0
unlike @entity91 and other @entity93 countries , @entity21 is a functioning , albeit incomplete , democracy and has been since 1950			0
@entity20 received a resounding mandate of almost half the vote in the last general elections in 2011			0
he still remains the most popular politician in @entity21 , while the opposition is widely seen by many @entity21 as weak and ineffective			0
undoubtedly , the global media coverage of the riots and the disproportionate security response has dented the international image of @entity20 and the governing @entity105 as a progressive force in @entity21 's political scene			1
nevertheless , the ultimate determinant of @entity20 's staying power will be the state of the @entity21 economy rather than anti-government demonstrations			1
what 's driving unrest and protests in @entity21 ?			1

@entity118 anti-government protests are *largest* in @entity21 in decade
police **crackdown** on *peaceful* protests against plans to demolish park sparked riots
protests spread from @entity2 to *67* of *81* of @entity21 's provinces
prime minister @entity20 calls **crackdown** ' excessive ' but says he 's not a *dictator*
