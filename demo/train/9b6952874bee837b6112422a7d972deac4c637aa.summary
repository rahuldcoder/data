-- the @entity1 , a smartphone that arrived in @entity3 stores on thursday , is huge -- and not just because of its unusually large size			1
the new @entity6 phone , which has been available in @entity7 for weeks , is the first to run @entity6 4.0 , the latest version of the popular mobile operating system that also goes by the adorable name @entity10			1
this is a very significant update to @entity6 for smartphones			1
i 've tested the @entity7 version of the @entity1 for about a week			1
it looks and functions about the same as the one for @entity3 , except that the @entity18 model uses different cellular chips to accommodate @entity3 's legacy infrastructure and its fourth - generation @entity22 data network			1
the @entity18 version also does not run @entity24 , the mobile payment system			1
the phone costs $ 300 with a two - year service contract			2
the @entity1 ' operating system takes many of the concepts that were designed for @entity6 tablets , shrinks them and unlocks their great potential to an audience that will likely be much larger			1
@entity6 tablets have not fared particularly well in the market , which means that this interface will look fresh to most people			1
( @entity39 's @entity38 , which analysts say has sold well at $ 199 , is a tablet based on @entity6 but looks completely different			1
) fewer buttons perhaps the most significant change to the software is that @entity44 has done away with the hardware buttons below the screen			1
these have become touchscreen buttons , which are n't all that different , but the direction they face flips depending on which way i 'm holding the phone			2
it 's a nice touch			2
now , there are only three onscreen buttons , instead of the usual four			2
these are used for returning to the previous menu , going to the home screen or viewing which apps are currently open			2
but many older @entity6 apps will stick a button , which looks like ellipses printed in @entity66 , on the end of those touchscreen buttons			1
developers are expected to update future versions of their apps to remove this button and instead incorporate those functions somewhere onscreen			2
in complex programs , like the web browser or the app market , @entity44 puts the everything - else button on the top bar			1
when moving quickly between old and new apps , i found myself losing track of where to look for extra functions			0
the dedicated multitasking button , in place of the search button , is a welcome addition			0
in previous versions a list of open apps could be activated by holding down the home button , but newcomers to the system had no idea it was there			0
rather than showing six icons , the button pulls up a list with snapshots of each program as they were when i left them			0
these pictures are generally too small to be useful , unlike on @entity6 tablets where this provides a handy visual cue			1
android 4.0 the @entity1 hardware is born from a collaboration between @entity44 and @entity110			1
much of the new operating system has gotten a thick coat of polish			0
in the apps menu , the buttons tilt slightly to denote when i 've encountered the end of the list			0
as i flip through , one page slides away as another smoothly pops into view			0
when cleaning up the notifications list , each line slides out separately like @entity125 pieces			0
turn off the screen , and it fades to black with a flicker of white in the middle , like a 1960s television set			0
these aesthetic pleasantries are sprinkled throughout @entity133 's competing @entity132 , like the icons dancing when they 're ready to be rearranged , but this type of elegance has been less common in @entity6			1
the subtle changes make @entity44 's software seem friendlier , in contrast to the sharp , weapon - like droid from before			1
despite its historical roughness , @entity6 found a huge audience among people who were not eager to take on the expenses associated with the @entity145			1
now that @entity133 has cut the prices on its phones and found a home at three of the four largest @entity18 operators , @entity6 is making itself more accessible , and not a moment too soon			1
the phone and contact list apps in @entity6 4.0 automatically create groups of frequently - contacted people to accompany the favorites feature			1
those apps look like miniature social networks , with detailed profiles and big pictures of friends			0
apps and features yet there remain many tools for gearheads			0
some of these are perhaps so " in your face " that they may deter less advanced users			0
a widget for toggling the phone 's various sensors , like @entity173 and @entity174 , is situated on one of the home screens			1
the icons may be familiar to pros , but my mom would not be able to identify each of the five or know what to use them for			0
the widgets can , of course , be ignored , but users should eventually take the time to learn them			0
these little doodads , which can be dragged to the various home screens , are more robust and customizable in @entity6 4.0			1
they are also easier to find , nestled right next to the list of apps installed on the phone			2
a new @entity193 monitor in the settings menu is a data lover 's or cheapskate 's new best friend			2
it presents detailed graphs about how many bytes the phone is sucking down from the cell network , separated by individual apps			2
it lets users manage their monthly caps in a very geeky , useful way			0
however , the app crashed several times during my week of testing			0
some of the other power - user options are overcomplicated			0
for example , the main screen contains three separate apps that many would assume do the same thing : messenger , messaging and talk , all of which have chat - bubble icons			0
the first is for group chats using the @entity224 social network ; the second is for text messaging through cell networks ; and the third is for instant messaging through @entity44 's network			1
this sort of hyper - option syndrome extends to smiley faces			0
the new @entity6 has a detailed directory of smileys			1
i 'm not sure if this is designed for power users looking for just the right trio of characters to express their precise emotions or as a reference guide for moms			0
either way , i learned some new things : specifically , that :-| means " poker face , " that : - ! means " foot in mouth , " and that : - $ means " money mouth			0
@entity248 , but too big ? despite the new cuddly @entity6 features , the phone looks like a tool of the military			1
the back looks like a metal grate , although it 's actually plastic			2
it comes off to allow me to easily change the battery , but it does n't snap on very easily			0
still , it 's nice that i can switch out the battery , unlike the @entity145			2
the @entity1 does have plenty of curves , including the screen itself , which @entity44 says is done to fit the contour of a face when making a call			1
but at 4.65 inches diagonally , the screen feels a little silly when pressed against my ear			0
because the screen is so gigantic , i had some difficulty operating it with one hand , struggling to stretch my thumb from one corner to switch apps and back to the other corner to compose an e-mail			0
typing requires more dexterity because my thumbs have to travel farther between keys			0
but @entity281 videos and @entity283 movies look fantastic on the big display			0
phone calls are crisp , and the speaker phone is fairly loud			2
battery life is adequate in normal usage , but i did not test the @entity3 version on the faster , @entity290			1
likely , battery life will suffer as a tradeoff for that speed			0
the gps navigator that has been in past versions of @entity6 is still free and still great , but battery life is abysmal , at about three hours			2
the sheer size of the @entity1 puts me off , but the hardware and companion software is sturdy and impressive			2
when other manufacturers adopt @entity6 4.0 , i expect to see some very compelling phones , though i do wonder how well the new version , without hardware buttons , would work on a smaller screen			1
we will find out soon enough			0
the @entity1 provides a clear view of the next generation of powerful @entity6 phones , and i look forward to seeing what comes next .			1

the @entity1 was born from a collaboration between @entity44 and @entity110
it 's the first phone with the latest version of @entity6 , called @entity10
the @entity18 version for @entity3 does not work with @entity24
