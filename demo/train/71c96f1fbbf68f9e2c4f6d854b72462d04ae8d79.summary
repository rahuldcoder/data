-- one of the problems with @entity3 politics is that it is falling prey to sideshows			1
issues that really do n't matter -- from the war on @entity9 to anything @entity10 said recently -- are given headline space above things that really do			1
and too often the things that do n't matter are about semantics ; someone says something innocent and the entire media explodes in horror			1
step forward @entity20 , one of those hyper - glamorous @entity22 anchors who deliver the news dressed for dinner			1
@entity20 hosted a segment in reaction to an article by @entity30 on @entity31 , in which @entity25 complained that a white @entity32 is stigmatizing and suggested he be replaced by a race - neutral penguin ( at the risk of excluding polar bears )			1
in the course of the @entity22 segment , @entity20 addressed the audience directly and said , " @entity32 just is white			1
" she went on to assert , " @entity40 was a white man , too			0
it 's like we have , he 's a historical figure that 's a verifiable fact , as is @entity32 , i just want kids to know that			2
how do you revise it in the middle of the legacy in the story and change @entity32 from white to black ? " the world went mad			1
accusations of @entity22 starting a race war flew around			2
@entity56 commentators pointed out that @entity40 was certainly not white ; one of them even wrote an emotional letter to @entity32 pleading for more tolerance			1
@entity61 came up with the inevitable skit of an @entity63 saying he is " as black as @entity64			0
" opinion : @entity32 's color is n't the important thing all of which need n't have happened if @entity20 's critics had watched the video and cut her some slack			1
the segment is jokey and she opened it by speaking to the kids at home , which is why she repeatedly reassured the audience that @entity32 is " real " ( no one over 10 years old is that naive )			1
at first she dismissed @entity25 ' argument as unnecessary and odd , but then actually came around to endorsing its sentiments , noting that it must indeed be painful to grow up in a culture surrounded by white idols			0
as for her assertion that @entity32 is white , her point was that he is universally depicted that way in popular culture			1
so , too , is @entity40 , although it was ignorant of @entity20 to imply that this is historically verifiable			2
likewise , i suspect the entire segment would not have drawn such controversy if @entity22 had bothered to invite a single person of color to appear on the panel			2
there was a gross lack of sensitivity on display			0
all in all , @entity20 is guilty of using lazy language			2
the debate surrounding her remarks is a classic example of the @entity3 media talking to itself , of point scoring against competitors dressed up as serious political debate			0
both the left and the right do it			0
teacher to student : you ca n't be @entity32 -- you 're black for example , @entity117 and @entity118 have a long - running grudge that erupted again last week when @entity117 accused @entity118 of trying to " disparage " @entity121			1
on the right , of course , @entity22 is no angel -- just take a look at the almost comical imbalance of its coverage of @entity129 versus the problems facing @entity131			2
@entity22 regularly obsesses about @entity56 's ratings , what its anchors say , as well as standard " liberals are trying to destroy the world " fare like killing @entity9			0
often , there is an unwillingness to show charity toward opponents			0
when @entity142 suggested that sometimes it might be best if kids skip dessert , @entity10 parodied this as an authoritarian crackdown on liberty and openly fed her children s'mores on tv to make her point			0
@entity10 misinterpreted @entity142 's advice as an order ; and much of the media misinterpreted @entity10 's joke as a serious statement			0
the original meaning and intent of the words that people used were largely forgotten in pursuit of a frivolous debate			0
the reality is that for millions of @entity3 these issues do n't matter one bit			1
they 're too busy worrying about debt , taxes and the war on terror			0
the most common reaction to the " controversy " over @entity32 's skin color would probably be , " i do n't care			2
" after all , he is not real			0
but unemployment , lack of health care , and terrorism , sadly , are real life issues			0
can we discuss something real , please ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			1

@entity22 anchor @entity20 causes an *uproar* when she says @entity32 is just white
@entity184 : can we discuss something real , please ?
he says issues that do n't matter are given headline space above things that do
