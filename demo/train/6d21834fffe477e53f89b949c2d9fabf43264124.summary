-- we 've all been there : a week until payday , the rent is due , and you 're rummaging in your parents ' attic to find @entity10 's @entity9 rookie card			2
only 36 of 200 official copies of the @entity12 have been found intact since 1820			2
if you 're in need of some quick cash , here are six stories of people who found a fortune when -- and where -- they least expected it			2
lose a hammer , find a horde in november 1992 , a farmer living near the village of @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , lost a hammer in one of his fields , so he asked @entity31 to use his metal detector to search for it			1
while looking for the hammer , @entity31 happened upon something else of interest -- 24 bronze coins , 565 gold coins , 14,191 silver coins , plus hundreds of gold and silver spoons , jewelry , and statues , all dating back to the @entity44			0
as required by @entity46 law , the so - called " @entity51 " was reported to the local authorities , who declared it a " @entity50 , " meaning it was now legally the property of @entity46			0
however , the government is required to pay fair market value for a treasure trove , meaning the farmer and @entity31 split a cool £ 1.75 million ( about $ 2.8 million )			1
the @entity51 is now on permanent display at the @entity57 , drawing thousands of people every year			0
sadly , there is no word on whether or not the hammer was ever found			2
@entity62 is a girl 's best friend @entity65 found a giant of a gemstone in 1924 -- a 40.23 carat diamond			1
it might surprise you to hear that he was n't digging in one of the famous @entity74 diamond mines at the time , but was near @entity76 , @entity62 , at a site that is now the @entity78			1
sitting on top of a volcanic pipe ( a geologic tube formed by an ancient underground volcanic explosion ) , the park is the only diamond site in the world that is open to the public			1
best of all , the park 's policy is : " you find it			1
no matter how valuable it is			0
" @entity65 's big find -- nicknamed " the @entity93 , " the largest diamond ever discovered in @entity95 -- was later cut down to 12.42 carat and sold for $ 150,000 in 1971 ( about $ 800,000 today )			1
but his was n't the last valuable rock dug out of that @entity62 soil			1
in 1964 , " @entity99 " was discovered at the same site , weighing in at 34.25 carat			2
then , in 1975 , came the 16.37 carat " @entity100			0
" the 6.35 carat " @entity101 " was found in 2006			2
and the crown jewel of the park has been the " @entity104 , " a comparatively small 3.09 carat diamond , that was dug up in 1990 , and expertly cut down to 1.90 carat			1
despite its smaller size , the @entity104 stands out because it was given a " @entity113 " rating by the @entity110 -- the first diamond to ever receive such a high grade			2
but do n't think this list of big gems means the site has been tapped out			2
on average , two diamonds are found every day at @entity78			2
they 're not all as big as the @entity93 , but maybe you 'll get lucky			0
there 's only one way to find out ... @entity0 : 10 diamond - encrusted things you do n't need if getting your hands dirty is n't your idea of fun , maybe you should start hitting garage sales and thrift stores to find valuables buried among the castoff bread machines and members only jackets			1
sometimes , one man 's trash really is another man 's treasure			1
the declaration of ( financial ) @entity138 we 've all heard of the man who bought a $ 4 painting at a garage sale , found an original copy of the @entity12 inside , and sold it for $ 2.4 million			1
a once - in - a - lifetime story , right ? not so much , actually			0
@entity145 was visiting a @entity147 thrift store , where he bought a candleholder , a set of salt and pepper shakers , and a yellowed print of the @entity12			2
@entity152 figured the document was a worthless , modern reprint , so he paid the asking price -- $ 2.48 -- and headed home			2
after looking over the document for a few days , he wondered if it might be older than he initially thought			0
so he hopped on the @entity159 to do some research and soon realized he had purchased one of only 200 official copies of the @entity12 commissioned by @entity163 in 1820			0
of those 200 , 35 had been found intact ; he had number 36			2
it took a year for @entity152 to have the print authenticated and preserved , and then he put it up for auction , netting a final sale price of $ 477,650			2
the salt and pepper shakers , on the other hand , were still worthless			0
a good heade for bargains one day , an employee at a tool - and - die company in @entity176 spent $ 30 for a few pieces of used furniture and an old painting of some flowers			1
when he got his new stuff home , he decided to strategically hang the picture to cover up a hole in the wall that had been bugging him			0
some years later he was playing a board game called @entity188 in which players attempt to outbid one another for artwork at an auction			0
much to his surprise , one of the cards in the game featured a painting of flowers that looked a lot like the one he had on his wall			0
so he went online and found that his painting was similar in style to the work of @entity204 , an @entity205 still - life artist best known for landscapes and flower arrangements			1
through his research he found the @entity209 in @entity210 , which handles many of @entity172 's works , and asked them to take a look at his painting			1
they agreed and were able to verify that the piece of artwork covering the hole in his wall was a previously unknown @entity204 painting , since named @entity220 on @entity221			1
in 1999 , @entity222 in @entity223 purchased the painting for $ 1.2 million dollars			1
i emailed the museum to ask if the painting was covering a hole in the wall , but i did n't get a reply			0
@entity0 : 6 really strange truck spills as you go in search of your nest egg , keep in mind the old adage : " it 's only worth what the market will bear			1
" sometimes finding treasure is the easy part ; finding someone willing to buy it can be the real challenge			0
it 's nice , but it 's no @entity246 ... every sunday afternoon for the last seven years , @entity247 had gone for a walk with her metal detector			1
she 'd never really found anything of value , but she liked getting the exercise , so she kept at it			0
on one sunday in june 2009 , her detector beeped , and she bent down to dig up what she thought was going to be another common coin or old nail			0
instead , she uncovered a postage stamp - sized gold pendant featuring an intricate carving of the crucifixion of @entity262			0
maybe she had finally hit the jackpot			0
upon inspection by the @entity57 , the pendant was described as " an important find , " and they estimated the market value to be around £ 4,000 ( about $ 6,600 )			0
still , they decided not to purchase it for their collection , so @entity247 took the pendant to @entity274 's			0
the experts at the auction house felt the piece was much more valuable , because it was believed to be one of only three similar items known to exist			0
their initial estimate was £ 250,000 ( $ 415,900 ) , but said it could easily sell for as much as £ 2.5 million ( $ 4.1 million ) thanks to its resemblance to another @entity27 treasure also found with a metal detector , the @entity285			1
but as the saying goes , " never count your millions until the auctioneer bangs his gavel			0
" @entity274 's put the pendant up for auction on july 9 , 2009 , making it the highlight of a large lot of antique sculptures			0
clearly the expectations were high			0
the bidding started at £ 30,000 ( about $ 49,900 ) , but as the final call was made , the best offer was only £ 38,000 ( about $ 63,200 ) -- far below the reserve price to make a sale			0
@entity0 : 6 articles of clothing that caused riots 6			0
a possible @entity305 in 1992 , @entity306 , a retired truck driver , went to her local thrift store to buy a depressed friend a gag gift			1
she found a rather large painting -- 66 inches by 47 inches -- that she thought was pretty amusing because it was , in her opinion , so ugly			1
when she asked the thrift store employee the price , they said $ 8			0
she haggled and only paid $ 5			1
in the end , her friend did n't want it ( she , too , thought it was ugly , plus it would n't fit through the door of her trailer ) , so @entity324 took it home and tried to unload it at her garage sale			0
a local art teacher saw the painting and suggested it could very well be a @entity305			1
in response , @entity324 famously asked the teacher , " who the f * * * is @entity305 ? " since that day , @entity306 has been struggling to prove that her thrift store treasure is a lost piece of artwork potentially worth well over $ 100 million			1
however , due to the painting 's lack of verifiable history of ownership ( called " provenance " ) , the piece is disputed by many fine arts experts as simply another artist 's work inspired by @entity305			1
to find proof of @entity305 , @entity324 had the work examined by a forensic specialist who claims to have found a fingerprint that matches one in @entity305 's studio			1
but even the fingerprint evidence has been disputed by the art world , leaving the painting , as yet , unsold			1
@entity324 , her painting , and her battle with the art world elite became the subject of a 2006 documentary called , appropriately , @entity361 ? for more mental_floss articles , visit @entity363 entire contents of this article copyright , @entity365 rights reserved .			2
