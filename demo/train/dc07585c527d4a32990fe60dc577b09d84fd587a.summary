-- the competition for payment processing services , especially mobile payments , is heating up			0
last week @entity4 kicked it up a notch by announcing that it 's phasing out @entity7 in favor of the new @entity9			2
this service supports in - store tap - to - pay payments from your phone via near field communications technology , as well as purchases on the web			1
if you log in to your @entity7 account now , you 'll be notified that you 've been switched over to @entity9			2
any credit cards or other payment information you 've saved in @entity7 will be available in @entity9			2
the catch : @entity9 is n't yet widely used for in - store purchases			1
so far its @entity23 payments are enabled only for @entity25 users who also have a @entity26 or a @entity4 prepaid card , and who are making purchases at @entity30 - enabled merchant locations			1
so this holiday shopping season , it 's unlikely that many people will be waving their phones around to buy holiday gifts			0
but in the coming year , more @entity36 smartphones will be equipped with @entity23 , bringing a variety of tap - to - pay or wave - to - pay options to consumers			1
a competing @entity23 - based mobile phone payment system , @entity41 , is launching in some markets ( @entity44 , @entity43 , and @entity45 ) in 2012			1
why are @entity36 retailers slow to adopt @entity23 payment technology ? one reason is the expense and effort required to install @entity23 - enabled point - of - sale equipment in stores and to integrate it with merchants ' systems			1
it 's a bit of a chicken - and - egg dynamic : retailers typically do n't invest in offering a new payment option until they see widespread consumer demand ; but few consumers are likely to prefer a payment option that 's not yet widely accepted			1
at the recent @entity64 , @entity62 of @entity63 observed : " merchants adopt new payment models because they increase sales			0
if i gave you a payment option that was totally free , merchants would n't adopt it unless it increased sales			0
" @entity74 writer @entity73 contends that payments alone are n't enough to make @entity23 popular			1
" mobile marketing , along with consumer loyalty , will be in the front seat as well and will be critical in helping to drive the growth and adoption of @entity23 , " he wrote			2
" while the idea of contactless payments is intriguing , there is increasingly an awareness that tapping a phone to pay for an item will not sell itself			1
... discounts , daily deals and loyalty reward programs can be activated through @entity23 technologies			2
" at the @entity64 , @entity91 , managing director of digital networks for @entity95 's @entity94 , said he also thinks retailers ' adoption of @entity23 will be driven by marketing			1
but he cautioned : " reward discounts are a race to the bottom			0
not every merchant engages in that , it 's just not part of their economics			0
" @entity91 thinks that in the long run , merchants may use @entity23 not just to deliver deals and coupons , but to deepen relationships with individual consumers			2
" that 's interesting , and it may be more profitable , but it 's a longer term play , " he noted			0
another @entity64 panelist , @entity117 's vp for mobile , @entity116 , made this point : " today , retailers learn about customers at the least effective time -- just when they 're leaving the store			0
they 'd like to know about you when you arrive at the store , so they can customize your shopping experience and treat you properly			0
" that may sound creepy to consumers ( remember " minority report " ? ) , but in the competitive retail business , merchants are constantly seeking an edge to boost sales and repeat business			0
the technology of @entity23 itself is still a moving target , and standards are n't settled			2
merchants are wary of investing in the next @entity140			0
this week a global organization of wireless carriers with @entity144 mobile networks announced that 45 carriers around the world -- including @entity147 , @entity148 , and @entity149 in the @entity36 -- are supporting standards for @entity23 payments and committed to support and launch services based on it			1
but , as @entity162 noted , " the crucial questions now will be whether these carriers stick to their word ; and whether handset makers , other infrastructure providers and consumers follow these carriers ' lead			0
" in the meantime , while these issues sort out , @entity4 also announced this week that it 's making it easier to integrate @entity9 into mobile web payments			1
granted , at most stores this probably would not make sense yet -- but it might appeal to the many consumers who buy movie tickets online , rather than stand in line at the box office			0
so @entity4 is partnering with @entity174 and @entity175 to offer @entity9 as a payment option for their mobile web checkout			1
once this option is implemented , users wo n't have to try to type their 16 - digit credit card number plus the expiration date and security code on their phone in order to buy a movie ticket			2
typing on mobile phones is a notorious hassle , and mobile web users often abandon their online shopping carts when they reach the point of entering payment information			0
of course , @entity174 and @entity175 do n't just sell tickets on the @entity194			1
they also offer their own apps for @entity196 , @entity197 , and other smartphone platforms			0
it 's unclear whether @entity9 will be offered as a payment option for in - app purchases -- but @entity202 , a partner with @entity203 , observed that if @entity4 decided to offer this ability , it might " pull the rug out from underneath @entity206 's 30 % tax on in - app purchases			1
" the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity211 .			0

@entity9 supports tap - to - pay phone payments using near field communication
@entity36 retailers are slow to adapt to @entity23 tools because of installation expenses and efforts
@entity9 will be offered as an option for @entity174 and @entity175
45 carriers around the world have announced their support of standards for @entity23 payments
