it may now be @entity2 's liveliest neighborhood , but a little over two decades ago it was n't even on the map			1
a tight - knit grid of nightspots and restaurants in the middle of capital city @entity10 , the district has become an emblem of @entity2 's slow lurch away from economic ruin			1
new bars appear almost daily and at weekends streets and sidewalks are packed with locals and tourists looking for a big night out			1
few places , if any , have undergone such a dramatic facelift			1
at the end of the ' @entity2 , under the totalitarian regime of @entity22 , was one of the planet 's most isolated states			1
no one was allowed to travel outside the country and thousands were held in secret gulags			1
beards were banned , as were the religions they were thought to represent			1
@entity33 ( ' @entity34 ' in @entity35 ) was @entity22 's refuge			1
armed guards stood on every street corner and ordinary citizens were kept out			2
on most maps the @entity40 was unmarked			1
" if you could compare it , @entity2 was like @entity44 is today , " says @entity42 , @entity10 's deputy mayor			1
@entity46 revolution at the center of it all sat @entity22 's private villa , a squarish , peach - colored mansion surrounded by palm - lined gardens and fountains			1
the @entity40 was a silent stronghold of @entity2 's elite			1
but when the regime were routed in 1992 elections , the @entity33 sprang into life as @entity10 's mayor urged inhabitants to grab the first paint pot they could find and soak the city 's gray walls in color			1
around the @entity40 , entire towers now display the bright greens , purples and pinks of this rainbow revolution			1
at street level too , the neighborhood is almost unrecognizable			2
dozens of cafes , bars and restaurants have made it @entity77 's premier nightspot			1
everywhere there are references to the @entity81 -- especially the @entity82 , whose brand of free - market capitalism @entity2 has adopted with varying degrees of success			2
one example is @entity88 , a diner inspired by @entity91 's drink of choice , where @entity94 caps and varsity pennants line the walls and skinny - jeaned @entity97 play table football			2
after living in @entity100 for three years , owner @entity99 wanted to return to @entity2 and build something from scratch			2
the @entity40 was his perfect opportunity			1
" this was all different , " he says			2
" it was all gardens , you could n't go in			2
it was @entity2 's internal border			2
" @entity99 and his brother built everything , from chairs and tables to a giant screen for sports made from dust sheets and wooden pallets			2
on big nights tables are booked in advance , even for drinks			2
@entity88 just ran its first beer pong tournament : 28 teams competed			2
elsewhere there are open - plan outdoor clubs where foreigners dance to thumping house music until the early hours			2
there are coffee shops where the staff call themselves baristas and care a little too much about coffee beans			2
almost all of @entity33 's venue 's names are in @entity136 , a detail that irks some locals			1
" @entity136 is a way to look trendy , " says @entity139 , a journalist			2
" youngsters say phrases like , ' it 's nice to be in love ' and ' you 're sexy ' in @entity136			0
it 's a bit stupid			0
we seem to prefer the western world more than our own country at times			0
" others gripe that @entity33 's meteoric change has gentrified it beyond the means of most locals			1
rents in the city are usually pegged at about $ 250 per month			0
in the @entity158 it 's twice that			0
drinks are still pretty cheap by @entity162 standards at about $ 1.50 for a local beer , and dinner in most places costs roughly 600 @entity35 lek , or $ 6			1
in a city where the average monthly salary is around $ 450 , however , it 's enough to price most out of the neighborhood			0
that 's partially because @entity2 's huge diaspora , many of whom fled when communism gave way to rampant crime and corruption in the early ' 90s , has begun to return			0
@entity178 is an 19 - year - old @entity82 whose family returned to @entity10 from @entity180 last year			1
@entity182 beaches " i like it here , " she says			0
" people here are used to drinking a bit more so they do n't really go over the limit			0
it 's strange that @entity33 is where all the communist leaders lived -- it 's a little ironic			0
" foreigners , too , are beginning to erase @entity2 's well - worn " best - kept - secret " label			0
in 2007 a shade more than a million people visited the country			0
by 2011 that had climbed to more than 2.7 million			0
tourism now accounts for 11 % of @entity2 's gdp thanks partially to its stunning , mountain - studded landscapes and pristine beaches			0
the country is also one of @entity205 's sunniest			0
" we wanted to see @entity2 because not many people back home know anything , " says @entity206 , a @entity208 backpacker cycling to @entity209 through the @entity210			0
" here we can still discover			0
it 's great : the people are young and nice			0
" @entity42 is glad that today 's generation , local or not , knows little of @entity33 's past and its former denizens			0
" it 's impossible to understand what that regime was like without living in it anyway , " he says			0
some aspects of @entity33 's regeneration give him cause for concern -- notably @entity22 's old villa , which is scheduled to open as a museum this year			1
" unfortunately there has been a surge in the myth of the dictator recently , " he adds			1
" it could be fancy to have the villa used to tell people what happened here before the ' 90s , but you run the risk of making it a cult and keeping that myth alive			0
" whatever happens to the villa , @entity33 has undeniably seen an extraordinary transformation , and each night it throngs with partygoers			0
there 's tons to see but @entity77 's best asset , say guidebooks , is its people			0
if that 's true then a trip to @entity33 should be top of any traveler 's list			0
recommendations : for coffee : @entity10			1
a trendy joint filled with old wireless sets and many of the city 's young laptop brigade			1
good to hang with friends or enjoy the kind of multisyllabic blends that get splashed all over @entity266			0
@entity10 , @entity267 , @entity268 29 , @entity269 1 , @entity10 ; for drinks : @entity271			1
yes , its theme might be cheesier than cheddar sandwich , but @entity88 is packed most nights and it 's a great spot for people - watching in the heart of @entity33			0
@entity278 , @entity279 , @entity10 , +355 694 03 4376 for dinner : @entity281			1
this @entity283 location is at the higher end of the pay scale , but the food and extensive wine list are worth it			0
good for a romantic meal beside the madness			0
@entity281 , @entity267 @entity291 , pas @entity292 , @entity10 ; +355 422 780 75			1

now a *nightlife* *hotspot* , the @entity40 was once the refuge of @entity35 dictator @entity22
the area in the @entity35 capital @entity10 is filled with dozens of cafes , bars and restaurants
some *complain* the area has been gentrified beyond the reach of locals
