@entity0 -- @entity2 may be drawing to a close but for the eurozone 's economy , spring has only just begun			1
after 18 months in recession , the single currency bloc finally posted some much needed growth in the form of a 0.3 % expansion of gross domestic product for the second quarter			1
watch more : @entity14 's new challenges @entity15 was quick to take the credit , claiming its policies of structural reforms had finally started to take hold , whilst the investor community cautioned more work would be needed to ensure the nascent recovery could be sustained			1
the truth is that yes , things are looking up but it depends where you are in @entity14 and there 's certainly little room for complacency			1
predictably , growth in the eurozone 's two biggest economies , @entity33 and @entity34 , underpinned the region 's revival			1
but a closer look at individual countries further down the pecking order throws up some unexpected surprises , which i 've outlined below			0
read more : can @entity14 drive a new industrial revolution ? @entity43 , a nation whose profligacy and lack of competitiveness led to it being bailed out , grew 1.1 % while the @entity49 , famous for its fiscal prudence , shrank 0.2 % -- its fourth straight quarter of contraction			1
the economies of @entity55 and @entity56 remained stuck in reverse gear as well			0
so much for the stereotypes and the hard and fast crisis response rules which have taken endless @entity61 summits to draft			0
reading the data one would be forgiven for thinking three years of austerity never happened			0
in fact it was n't even mentioned once in @entity67 's own communique			2
watch more : why @entity14 's problems will come back and yet the challenge for @entity14 's leaders at a time when some of them are coming up for re-election will be to seize upon the green shoots without dropping the ball on spending cuts			1
in @entity33 , which will face a general election next month , business groups are already lobbying any incoming government to boost investment spending			2
and in @entity34 , large firms are still loath to hire due to the government 's lack of fiscal clarity and president @entity87 's new punitive tax regime			2
a ceo of one @entity90 business with over 60,000 staff across the @entity61 told me @entity14 was in recovery , and that presented opportunities -- but confidence was needed to ensure the upswing really took hold			1

indeed , the next challenge for @entity14 's top brass will be to convince companies the future is bright enough to start hiring again			1
across the eurozone and the broader @entity61 as a whole , firms have been amassing huge cash reserves which , in the face of uncertainty , have been neither spent on new machinery nor on the hiring of new staff			2
such businesses will need more evidence of a true lift than a mere quarter of expansion before they are to undertake any hefty capital expenditure			0
the eurozone crisis has dominated the political and economic sphere for more than three years			2
during that time millions have lost their jobs creating a legacy of high unemployment and long - term underemployment which will take years to tackle			0
with more than a quarter of their populations out of work today , countries like @entity56 and @entity134 will probably still finding solutions to their jobs crisis by the time the next recession rolls around			2
explore : how the crisis made the rich richer and the poor poorer that 's not counting a whole generation who missed its first step on the job ladder			0
if @entity14 really has learned its lesson , business and government should start setting the wheels in motion now to work together and retrain staff for the jobs available today and tomorrow			1
more jobs would boost domestic consumption and help provide a counterweight to export - dependency of the growth generators like @entity33			0
but to hire , businesses need to be offered incentives			0
one incentive is a stable , more robust economy			0
another is a benign interest rate environment , which is why what would really give this recovery legs is a rate cut by the end of this year			0
