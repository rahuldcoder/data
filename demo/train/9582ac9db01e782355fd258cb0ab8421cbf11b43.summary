-- anyone who climbs a high - security fence at an airport and scurries onto a runway would have to be drunk , on drugs or desperate , one might think			1
two men -- at two separate airports in @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 , @entity11 -- did just that on christmas day			1
one showed " indications of possible drug and alcohol impairment			0
" the other was wearing woman 's clothing and was not interested in anything at the airport -- instead he was seeking safety from someone who frightened him , police said			1
both men were charged with trespassing and released			0
the breach at @entity8 exposed a failure of a $ 100 million system designed to protect @entity32 area airports			1
the @entity10 fence hop was the fifth in a decade at that airport , @entity0 affiliate @entity33 reported			1
fleeing in woman 's clothing when @entity39 , 24 , allegedly mounted the barrier at @entity8 , it went unnoticed for a day			1
on thursday , a review of security camera footage revealed his ascent , according to @entity45 police			2
the cross-dressed suspect then ran across two runways to get to @entity49 , two police sources said			0
nobody saw it , but he was literally on the screen at the time			0
the security apparatus in the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) made by @entity55 combines radar with video cameras , motion detectors and " smart " fencing , according to the maker 's website			1
someone else may not have			0
cameras captured images of the intruder and an alarm went off			2
police are investigating the actions of the person who monitors the images			0
an airport employee nabbed the suspect , port authority police chief @entity72 said in a statement			0
he wants to know " why it took an unacceptably long time for officers to locate and take into custody a suspect who was being held by an airport employee			0
" a law enforcement official , who is not authorized to speak publicly about the case , said @entity39 told detectives he got spooked while in a car with someone and tried to get away , the official said			0
the fright was apparently enough to drive @entity39 over two big barriers			0
he allegedly scaled an eight - foot exterior fence and then a 10 - foot , high - tech fence equipped with motion sensors and cctv cameras , said @entity95 , a spokesman for airport police officers			1
@entity10 drunken folly ? also on christmas day , police in @entity10 arrested 49 - year - old @entity99 after he allegedly ran onto the tarmac at @entity101 , police said			1
@entity105 officials saw a man climb over a fence and run onto the tarmac and taxiway , where he headed for a @entity111 plane , @entity10 police spokesman @entity102 said			1
the pilot shut down the plane 's engines when told the man was approaching			2
the suspect , who appeared intoxicated , struck the plane 's engine with his hands before heading toward the terminal , where he was arrested			1
@entity121 , deputy aviation director at the @entity10 airport , said @entity101 some years ago decided against installing @entity54 fencing because it was costly and unproven			2
" the technology was not something we felt was worth investing in , " she said			0
" it was extremely expensive and not something we felt was warranted			0
" the airport instead relied on layers of security , including barbed - wire fences , cameras and the eyes of airport workers			1
failures in @entity54 , at @entity8 the @entity8 breach marked the pricey system 's second recent flub			1
a union official said the system did detect an intruder who scaled a fence at @entity144 last week but the suspect was n't apprehended until 10 minutes after being detected by @entity54			2
" if the system worked properly we would have caught the guy as he 's climbing the fence , " @entity95 said			1
the @entity54 system generates many false positives and some cameras do n't work properly in dark areas			2
" sometimes when it rains , when the wind blows , " he said , " the system shuts down			0
" in august 2012 , the @entity54 at @entity144 failed to notice a man who walked onto a runway , authorities said			2
the man , who was arrested after being spotted by an airline employee , told police he was on a @entity160 on @entity161 adjacent to the runway and became stranded , according to the @entity45			1
the man climbed onto the tarmac from the water , but the airport 's security system did not detect him			1
@entity95 said the authority resumed regular police patrols along the perimeters of airports after that breach			0
@entity172 , an aviation expert and professor at @entity174 , said the intrusion detection technology has been used around prisons and military bases for a long time but was relatively new to airports			2
" in this case , you 've got older technology that 's proven in certain areas , but now you 've put it into a new environment , a new dynamic , " he said			0
there are no fixed standards for the systems because the federal @entity188 does n't require them , @entity172 said			0
security in and around airports , as opposed to gates and planes , is handled by local authorities , not the national @entity188			0
all airports , however , report their security plans to the @entity197			0
in 2012 , the @entity188 was criticized for failing to report , track and fix other types of airport security breaches adequately , according to the @entity190 's inspector general			2
the agency 's report said the @entity188 " does not have a complete understanding " of breaches at the nation 's airports			0
the report was requested by the @entity210 @entity209 sen. @entity208 after a series of breaches at @entity8 , including a knife bypassing @entity188 screening , passengers walking around security checkpoints and a dead dog transported without being screened for explosives			1
the @entity188 took action to fix only 42 % of the security breaches documented at the @entity8 airport , according to the report			1
when compared with other airports studied in the report , @entity8 was the lowest - scoring when it came to fixing vulnerabilities			1
3 things that really happened at an airport @entity0 's @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 contributed to this report .			0

@entity8 security cameras spotted a man in woman 's clothes climbing over fence
@entity10 security arrested an ' inebriated ' man who struck a *jet* engine with his hand
a *multimillion* - *dollar* identification system apparently fails to stop the intrusion in @entity8
expert : the security system has failed before and still needs fixing
