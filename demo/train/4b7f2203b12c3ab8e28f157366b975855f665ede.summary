jurors will return to court thursday for the aggravation phase of the trial -- an important step in the next key decision they face : determining whether @entity17 lives or dies			1
" now the odds , i think , shift somewhat in her favor , because it 's a very different thing to sentence someone to die than to convict them , " @entity19 senior legal analyst @entity18 said			2
in a television interview minutes after the verdict was announced , @entity17 said she 'd prefer a death sentence			1
" i said years ago that i 'd rather get death than life , and that still is true today , " she told @entity31 television station @entity30			1
