-- @entity1 said wednesday that it never provided identification numbers of iphones and @entity4 to the @entity5 , after hackers claimed to have scored millions of them by breaking into an agent 's laptop			1
" the @entity5 has not requested this information from @entity1 , nor have we provided it to the @entity5 or any organization , " @entity1 said in a statement to @entity0			2
hackers with @entity15 , one of the multitude of groups associated with web activist movement @entity19 , posted online what they claimed are the ids of more than 1 million iphones and @entity4			1
and they say that 's just part of the more than 12 million ids -- and other information such as users ' names , cell phone numbers and billing addresses -- they got from the laptop of an @entity5 agent			1
@entity1 added that in its latest mobile operating system , @entity34 6 , @entity1 has replaced the types of identifiers the hackers appear to have gotten and will be discontinuing their use			1
security experts have said that the @entity26 , posted on document - sharing site @entity40 , appear to be legitimate			0
a day earlier , the @entity5 denied the hackers ' claim that they accessed the laptop of @entity44 , a cybersecurity expert , by exploiting a vulnerability in programming language @entity47			2
" at this time there is no evidence indicating that an @entity5 laptop was compromised or that the @entity5 either sought or obtained this data , " the @entity5 said in a statement			2
the bureau 's press office went further on its @entity57 feed			0
" bottom line : totally false , " it wrote			0
via the @entity57 account that first posted a link to the documents , the hackers responded quickly wednesday as word of @entity1 's statement began spreading			1
" @entity1 : we did n't give @entity5 any device ids			1
but who did ? that 's the 10000001 $ question , " read a post on the feed			0
the group says it released exactly 1,000,001 ids of the more than 12 million it collected			2
in one of the story 's more bizarre twists , the website @entity76 posted a photo wednesday of one of its reporters , @entity81 , wearing a ballet tutu with a tennis shoe on his head			0
in their @entity40 post , the hackers , in typically irreverent style , said they would n't be talking to the media about the hack unless @entity76 posted such a photo of @entity81 , who sometimes writes critically of @entity19			0
as of wednesday afternoon , @entity81 said he had yet to hear from @entity19 .			0

@entity1 : we did n't give @entity94 , @entity4 ids to the @entity5
hackers claim they got 12 million numbers from an agent 's laptop
@entity1 's new mobile operating system will quit using the numbers
