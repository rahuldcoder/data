the two leaders met for more than two hours on @entity2 's first visit to @entity4 as president , part of a @entity16 swing that he said was intended to assess the seemingly intractable impasse between the @entity4 and @entity18 over how to live next to each other			1
other issues discussed on @entity2 's first foreign trip of his second term included the civil war in neighboring @entity24			1
there have been unconfirmed reports of chemical weapons being used in the conflict , which @entity2 labeled a " game - changer , " if true , regarding limited @entity31 involvement so far			2

@entity2 pushed at a joint news conference for continued diplomatic efforts , including negotiations and sanctions , intended to get @entity7 to comply with international safeguards against nuclear arms			2
" the question is whether the @entity7 leadership will seize that opportunity , " @entity2 said before playing off a memorable @entity64 line by @entity65 about the @entity66 : " we ca n't even trust yet , much less verify			2
" at the same time , he insisted that " all options " remain open -- code for a military strike to disable the @entity7 program			2
@entity2 also made clear that @entity4 has the right to defend itself as it sees fit , which amounted to a diplomatic signal that @entity74 would not stop a unilateral @entity4 strike at some future point if no progress occurred			0
opinion : @entity2 's @entity4 trip is about legacy @entity3 responded with thanks , saying @entity2 spoke of " the great transformation that has occurred in the life of the @entity85 people with a rebirth of the jewish state " that has grown from a once powerless population into a nation that has " both the right and the capability " to defend itself			1
" i know that you appreciate that @entity4 can never cede the right to defend ourselves to others , even to the greatest of our friends , and @entity4 has no better friend than the @entity31 , " @entity3 added			0
both leaders also said they had a " common assessment " on how much time remained before @entity7 could build a nuclear weapon			1
though @entity3 indicated his " red line " for action might be sooner , referring to what he called a " point of immunity " when @entity105 completed enriching enough uranium for a weapon			0
@entity7 has rebuffed calls to halt its production of enriched uranium , saying it has a right to produce peaceful nuclear energy			0
but the @entity115 , the @entity117 nuclear watchdog , has said it can no longer verify any peaceful nature of @entity7 's nuclear program			0
poll : most @entity31 say @entity4 is a friend most @entity31 consider @entity4 an ally or at least friendly to the @entity31 , according to a new @entity1 / @entity124 poll released tuesday			0
however , respondents split -- 49 % -49 % -- on whether the @entity31 should support @entity4 if it unilaterally attacks @entity7 nuclear facilities to prevent @entity105 from developing nuclear weapons , the survey showed			1
on @entity2 's first day in @entity4 , @entity18 activists erected a tent city outside @entity0 in the @entity132 to protest his visit and continued @entity4 construction of settlements in what they consider an occupied territory			1
meanwhile , demonstrators in @entity139 protesting @entity4 and @entity31 policies toward @entity18 burned flags of both nations as well as a picture of @entity2			1
@entity4 president : no doubt @entity2 has @entity4 's back the topic of settlements , a sticking point in the stalled @entity16 peace process , never came up at the news conference by the leaders , showing the sensitivity of the issue			1
" i purposely did not want to come here with some big announcement " that might not match up with reality on the ground , @entity2 told reporters			0
the @entity4 - @entity18 dispute both leaders said they discussed the @entity4 - @entity18 stalemate and @entity24 , further complicated by accusations that chemical weapons were used this week			2
@entity4 justice minister @entity164 told @entity1 on wednesday that " it is clear for us here in @entity4 " that chemical weapons have been used in @entity24			0
when pressed during an interview , @entity164 would n't say whether there was evidence that the regime of @entity24 president @entity172 directed their use			0
she said the development poses a direct threat to @entity4 because " the appearance is that it 's not going to be only in @entity24 , but that @entity177 can reach all these chemical weapons and use them against @entity4 in the future			0
" @entity4 have long been concerned that @entity177 , @entity4 's foe in neighboring @entity180 , could gain possession of @entity24 chemical weapons if the @entity172 regime is further destabilized			2
@entity2 repeated @entity31 warnings to the @entity24 government to keep chemical weapons off the battlefield or out of the hands of groups such as @entity177			0
he said he has ordered an investigation into whether the @entity24 government used chemical weapons against its own people , adding he was " deeply skeptical " of any claim the opposition had done it			0
" once we have established the facts , i have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game - changer , " @entity2 declared , stopping short of saying what he would do if @entity24 had crossed his " red line " for stronger action			0
@entity1 poll : most say @entity4 a friend critics , including @entity207 opponents , say @entity2 has failed to show necessary global leadership by providing military aid to the @entity24 opposition or offering help like establishing a " no - fly " zone over @entity24 similar to @entity214 steps taken in @entity215 during the @entity217 uprising			1
earlier , @entity3 and @entity4 president @entity218 greeted @entity2 at an arrival ceremony in @entity220 , where @entity2 said his visit was " an opportunity to reaffirm the unbreakable bond between our nations , to restate @entity31 's unwavering commitment to @entity4 's security , and to speak directly to @entity4 and to your neighbors			1
" in a quip to @entity3 , @entity2 said , " it is nice to get away from @entity232 , " reflecting the chronic political infighting in @entity74			0
@entity2 's first stop wednesday was at an @entity236 missile defense launcher in @entity220			2
designed by @entity4 and funded by the @entity31 , the battery was deployed at the height of november 's fighting between @entity4 and @entity240			2
it intercepted a rocket headed for @entity220 , @entity4 ambassador to the @entity31 @entity243 said			0
afterward , the president went to @entity0 to meet separately with @entity218 and @entity3			0
a shaky relationship @entity2 's relationship with @entity3 has never been warm , and the @entity4 prime minister supported @entity207 challenger @entity248 -- a former business colleague -- in last year 's presidential election			1
in his first term , @entity2 got off to a rocky start with @entity3 by pushing for a freeze on @entity4 settlements , but his vocal support for the @entity4 prime minister through the november crisis with @entity240 and @entity31 financial support for the @entity236 anti-missile program could pave the road for greater trust in the relationship			1
@entity262 officials said @entity2 was not bringing a new peace initiative and lacked optimism that enough solid ground existed to try to revive direct negotiations between @entity4 and the @entity18 over the declared goal of both sides for separate , neighboring states			1
@entity4 minister says she hopes @entity31 helps restart peace talks most of all , the president 's aides said , @entity2 wanted to assess how prepared -- if at all -- @entity3 and @entity18 leader @entity274 were to return to negotiations			1
@entity18 want @entity2 to prove there were consequences for @entity4 's continued construction of new settlements in what they consider to be disputed areas			1
their grievances are evident in more personal ways : posters on @entity287 streets sarcastically advise @entity2 not to bring his smartphone because @entity4 does not allow 3g or better service in the @entity18 territories			1
before meeting @entity218 on wednesday , @entity2 and the @entity4 president planted a magnolia tree descended from those at the @entity262 to symbolize the deep roots of the relationship between their nations , the @entity262 said			2
the two leaders also were serenaded with the song " tomorrow " by three young @entity4 who dedicated it " from all the children who dream of peace			0
" the @entity31 and @entity4 and the art of relationship maintenance @entity1 's @entity305 and @entity306 reported from @entity4 , and @entity1 's @entity307 and @entity308 also contributed to this report			2
