it 's true that @entity3 's beaches , rice paddies , volcanoes and temples lure the crowds			1
those seeking serenity , however , should n't be put off -- the island offers a smattering of under - the - radar destinations where life ambles along at a more sedate pace			2
here are a few places where travelers can escape the hustle but still find plenty to fill an itinerary			0
@entity20 @entity3 's @entity20 beach has long been popular with intrepid surfers , with the beach offering multiple breaks			1
while they 're mostly suited to experienced surfers , beginners can probably have some fun in the wash			2
the black - sand beach has a rugged , somewhat desolate feel thanks to the thundering surf			1
while it 's not really swimmer - friendly , it 's great for long contemplative walks and rummaging for flotsam and jetsam			1
there are yoga retreats at the low - key resorts along the beach , and rental motorbikes for exploring the side road around @entity20 , where rice paddies tumble down to meet the sea			1
at nearby @entity46 , a temple plays host to a massive cave full of bats that emerge at sunset			0
accommodation at @entity20 is mostly targeted toward surfers but some family - friendly as well as upper - end places are available			1
expect a mix of surfer fare and local food at the guesthouses			0
sidemen @entity60 is a small village located in a yawning valley about an hour 's drive inland from the mid-east coast			2
here you 'll enjoy paddy views from your guesthouse or along a rejuvenating ramble through terraces with occasional red hibiscus or pink frangipani trees that make for pretty photo opportunities			0
@entity60 is a great spot to rent a pushbike or join a small group tour to coast downhill via a route with fantastic views			0
overnight visitors can wake up early to climb the summit of @entity81 , the island 's tallest and most revered volcano , in time for sunrise -- this is a challenging hike			2
accommodation at @entity87 is generally a great value and ranges from basic through to mid-range , with a few places offering pools			0
@entity93 truth be told , @entity93 has long been on the map for tourists seeking to elude @entity3 's crazy south , but the series of looping bays along the coast of east @entity3 retains a charming washed - out feel -- like a spot that enjoyed a long - passed heyday and now has a rather slightly sleepy @entity105 feel			1
the appeal here is solid off - the - beach snorkeling and diving in several of the bays , including the @entity112 wreck at @entity113			1
you can base yourself at @entity93 to snorkel the liberty wreck at @entity116 , too			2
otherwise , it 's a great place to just relax and watch the jukungs ( traditional outrigger canoes ) fan out with their colorful triangular sails onto the waters before dawn , returning in the early morning			2
or , hire a boatman to take you out to see the sunrise over @entity129 's highest peak , @entity130			2
@entity131 @entity3 is n't all beaches , cocktails and tropical weather			1
after driving through the winding scenic roads in north @entity3 , through forest - clad mountains , you 'll reach the little out - of - the - way village of @entity139 , where the air is so crisp you can forget about air - conditioning			1
offering mostly guesthouses and home stays , this is n't a place for luxury , but anywhere you pick should have fantastic views of forest , farmland and paddies studded with coconut palms to remind you that , yes , you 're still on a tropical island			0
maps available at hotels highlight an array of low - key walks , including several impressive waterfalls that are easy to reach on foot			0
@entity131 is mostly appealing for what is n't here : no crowds , no tourist shops and no hassles			0
@entity164 @entity3 does n't just include the main island itself			1
a cluster of three islands lie about 20 kilometers to the east , easily reachable by public boat or speedboat : @entity171 , which is popular with expatriates , tiny @entity173 and the largest of them all , stunning @entity164			0
the island is geographically similar to @entity3 's @entity175 and , thanks to its relative remoteness , was a prison during the early 18th century			1
while the diving here is excellent -- manta rays and mola molas when conditions are right -- you 'll also be rewarded by renting a motorbike to go exploring on the relatively barren island , where you can skirt spectacular cliffs soaring hundreds of meters high			0
best to get here soon : a luxury @entity190 hotel is slated to open at @entity192 in 2015			0
@entity193 @entity194 is home to a national park with excellent snorkeling and diving at @entity198 , and is the last refuge of the endangered @entity3 starling			1
in fact , @entity201 is arguably @entity3 's best snorkeling and diving location : you can float over coral gardens of brilliant blues , greens and pinks and spot a vast array of marine life on an organized trip or rent a boat from the pier yourself -- you may see dolphins along the way , with @entity218 's volcanoes in the distance providing an impressive backdrop			1
travelers can base themselves at @entity222 , located outside the park , though those on a larger budget can try the @entity225 within the park			0
hotels can arrange hikes , where chances are good you 'll see @entity230 and @entity232 muntjac ( barking ) deer			0
@entity234 has been living and working in @entity235 since 1997and these days manages online regional guide @entity236 .			0

@entity3 might be a popular tourist destination but there are crowd - free corners worth exploring
with its black - sand beach , @entity20 is popular among intrepid surfers
@entity193 is home to @entity3 's top snorkel site
