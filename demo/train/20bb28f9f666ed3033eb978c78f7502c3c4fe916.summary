@entity0 -- corporate lobbyists may have to jockey for attention alongside smaller , grassroots organizations under new ethics rules issued by president - elect @entity8 's transition team , one analyst says			1
president - elect @entity8 's rules will mean nonprofits will have an easier time being heard , an analyst says			1
@entity14 , a @entity15 professor who teaches lobbyists - in - training , said nonprofit groups are likely to have a stronger voice under the restrictions that @entity8 's transition staff issued this week			1
" lobbyists for business will absolutely get meetings with staff for people on @entity26 , just like they got meetings before , so their access will not be denied , " @entity14 said			2
" their positions will be heard , but now they wo n't be the only ones being heard			0
" the rules , which transition co-chairman @entity33 announced tuesday , bar federal lobbyists from contributing to or raising money for the transition effort			1
those who leave the transition team will be barred for a year from lobbying the incoming administration on matters related to their transition jobs , and current lobbyists who join the team are barred for 12 months from working in policy fields related to their lobbying work			1
@entity33 called the new policy " the strictest , the most far - reaching ethics rules of any transition team in history			1
" they follow a pledge @entity8 made during his campaign , when he instituted similar rules for aides and vowed that lobbyists " will not drown out the voice of the @entity57 people			2
" @entity14 said lobbying is protected by the @entity60 , which guarantees the right to petition the government for redress of grievances , and that the trade 's ranks in @entity0 are unlikely to shrink			0
but she said corporate lobbyists " will have to share the stage with other people representing other points of view			2
" " i think that lobbyists for a broader range of the @entity57 public -- lobbyists for @entity80 , lobbyists for the @entity76 , lobbyists for domestic violence groups -- people trying to bring those positions forward will have an easier time being heard , " @entity14 said			0
one practicing lobbyist told @entity1 he hopes the new rules will improve the public image of a trade that has become a " dirty word			0
" @entity87 , who has pleaded the case for some of the biggest @entity57 corporations for 16 years , said a stricter regime @entity92 imposed on itself after the influence - peddling scandal involving disgraced lobbyist @entity94 " was n't such a bad thing at all			0
" " we were all very upset when we found out we could no longer take @entity97 staffers to lunch , " he said			0
" but you know what ? at the end of the day , we all saved money and lost weight			0
" but seriously , @entity87 said , both @entity8 and his @entity105 opponent , @entity104 , blasted lobbyists on a near - daily basis during the presidential campaign , " and it 's my hope that we can bring down that level of vilification by cooperating with the new administration			2
