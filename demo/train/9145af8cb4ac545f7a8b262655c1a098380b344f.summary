@entity0 , @entity1 -- four days have passed since @entity1 authorities discovered undeclared military weapons hidden aboard a @entity6 ship , and the painstaking process of examining the entire vessel is crawling at a snail 's pace			1
the ship has five cargo holds , only one of which has been emptied as of thursday			1
" the technicians on board have told us that this cargo was loaded in a way that makes it difficult to unload , " @entity1 security minister @entity14 said			2
the @entity6 crew had resisted the @entity1 authorities and cut the cables to the onboard cranes			1
@entity1 investigators brought their own cranes , but removing the containers inside the cargo holds has been an " odyssey , " @entity14 said			1
the ship originated in @entity30 , and the @entity30 have admitted to owning the military equipment , claiming it was being sent to @entity6 to be repaired and returned			1
if the weapons were not a secret , why were they hidden under sacks of sugar ? why the did the captain attempt to commit suicide ? a public prosecutor is charging the captain and 35 @entity6 crew members with illegal possession of weapons and international arms trafficking , @entity1 government spokesman @entity41 said			1
@entity6 officials , meanwhile , asked for @entity1 to release the cargo ship and let the crew go			1
@entity1 has formally asked the @entity51 for guidance on how to handle the case			0
" for us , it is important to finish this operation , wait for the @entity51 to come , and they will decide " how to proceed , @entity14 said			0
" @entity1 is completely transparent in this ; we have no experience in dealing with this type of problem			0
" because it is pursuing nuclear weapons , @entity6 is banned by the @entity51 from importing and exporting most weapons			1
scene at the port at the port of @entity67 , inspectors opened shipping containers in front of reporters			1
heavily armed troops stand guard			0
in the first cargo hold , six shipping containers were found underneath sacks of brown sugar , in two stacks of three			1
the tops of some of the containers were caved in because of the weight of the sugar			0
inside the containers lies the military equipment			2
inspectors walked inside the containers , taking pictures			0
@entity30 officials have described the materiel as " 240 metric tons of obsolete defensive weapons " sent to @entity6 " to be repaired and returned to @entity30			1
" the equipment was manufactured in the mid- 20th century and included two anti-aircraft missile systems , nine missiles in parts and spares , two @entity99 - 21 jets and 15 motors for this type of airplane , the @entity30 foreign ministry said			2
@entity103 involved in investigation the @entity103 and @entity1 had been tracking the ship as it crossed the @entity107 to @entity30 and then back , two @entity103 officials said			2
and a @entity109 spokeswoman said wednesday that the @entity103 would help in the investigation			0
the @entity1 asked the @entity103 for imaging equipment and technicians to fully examine the boat and determine what is on board , according to a @entity103 official who declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to speak publicly			0
speculation has surged since @entity1 announced its find , with some warning that it was a troubling sign of weapons deals between @entity6 and @entity30 , and others disputing whether any dangers lay within the antiquated haul			1
@entity30 says the weapons are " obsolete			2
" and experts who identified early @entity129 relics such as the @entity132 - designed @entity131 air defense system among the ship 's cargo say that 's not far from the truth			2
" today there is no reason for any @entity140 pilot to be hit by an @entity131			0
if you get caught by one of them , you 've done something bloody stupid , or you 've got very bad luck , " said @entity141 , editor of @entity142 and @entity143			0
" no modern country wants to be seen with those			0
" but others saw the weapons haul as a more ominous sign			0
