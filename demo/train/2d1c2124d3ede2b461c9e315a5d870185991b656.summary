@entity0 , @entity1 -- i landed in @entity0 on a december afternoon after a conference in @entity5			1
walking on the air bridge , i looked out of the window and noticed that it was dark			2
subconsciously , i looked at my watch , and it was 4:40 pm			0
though it was winter and the sun sets early , it was too early to be so dark			0
it turned out to be another day of heavy smog in @entity0			1
the moment i drove out of the parking lot , i realized how terrible it was			0
visibility was extremely low , as if a dense fog had descended upon the city			0
the headlights and taillights were hazy , and i could n't see much beyond the highway			0
i felt that the air i breathed in was heavier , and that something was irritating my eyes			2
the joy of homecoming was instantly replaced by the sadness of living in a heavily - polluted city			0
residents of @entity0 and nearby cities seem to have become accustomed to such heavy smog , but those in the @entity36 to the south have not			1
so it became national news when , starting from december , @entity40 , @entity41 , and other cities in that region were cloaked in heavy smog for about a week			0
schools and highways were closed , and many flights were canceled			0
in the past , @entity0 was called @entity1 's capital of smog			1
now @entity1 has a smog belt that extends from @entity0 all the way to @entity40			1
it took a little more than three years to build up the high speed railway that connects @entity0 and @entity40 , but it took less than two years for smog to spread from @entity0 to @entity40			1
at this rate , the nationalization of smog will be accomplished in even less time			0
this new " great leap forward " in pollution could be as disastrous as the @entity60 of the 1950s , when a push to industrialize and collectivize caused a famine that reportedly killed millions of people			2
smog is a major cause of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases			0
according to @entity72 , a doctor at the no. 8 @entity73 , the number of respiratory patients treated by the hospital in early december increased by 96 % , and medical costs for these patients increased by 195 % , compared with statistics from the same period last year			0
though a little bit outdated , a study conducted in 2007 by the @entity78 and the @entity79 reported that 750,000 @entity1 people die prematurely every year , mainly due to air pollution in large cities			1
thus @entity1 may well become sick before it becomes modern			1
in the 19th century , @entity1 's reputation as the " sick man of @entity86 " stemmed from foreign aggression and internal division			1
ironically , in the 21st century , that tag is a product of @entity1 's growing power			1
for a government that has relied on economic performance as a cornerstone of its legitimacy , it has had few incentives to slow down economic development for the sake of environmental protection			0
the @entity1 model thus boils down to " development at all costs			2
" yet faced with mounting public discontent and anger , the central government has taken some measures to address environmental pollution , such as the " @entity109 for the @entity110 and @entity111 " released in september last year			1
to achieve the goals set out in the plan by 2017 , the government needs to invest $ 1.75 trillion , according to one estimate			0
this is more than twice the amount of the economic stimulus package that the @entity1 government launched in 2008			2
in defending the government 's gdp - centered growth strategy , some @entity1 officials point out @entity124 countries also adopted the model of " development first , conservation later " in their early stages of modernization			1
this is true , and @entity124 countries paid a dear price too			0
in the @entity135 , names such as @entity133 and @entity134 still evoke memories of heavy smog and tragic human loss			0
but one advantage late - developing countries hold is that they can avoid repeating the same mistakes made by early - developing countries			0
there is no need for millions of @entity1 to die prematurely before the @entity1 government takes immediate and decisive action to reduce pollution			1
these days the " @entity1 dream " is a hot topic among @entity1 officials and scholars			1
the @entity1 government certainly deserves credit for the dramatic improvement in material welfare of the @entity1 people over the past three decades , which is undoubtedly an important component of the @entity1 dream			2
however , it seems that today the biggest dream of the average @entity1 is to have more days of fresh air and blue sky			1
if the @entity1 government can not make this come true for the @entity1 people , the @entity1 dream may well become a @entity1 nightmare			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

@entity1 's " smog belt " is expanding , with disastrous health implications , says @entity164
@entity1 may well become sick before it becomes modern , he says
@entity0 has taken measures to address pollution but requires more investment
the biggest dream of the average @entity1 is to have more days of fresh air and blue sky
