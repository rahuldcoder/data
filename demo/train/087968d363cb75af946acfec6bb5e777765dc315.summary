-- @entity1 are rightly angry that @entity2 plans to use its merger with the @entity5 doughnut and coffee chain @entity7 to claim @entity5 citizenship , probably as a way to avoid paying @entity1 taxes -- which the burger chain denies			1
but @entity2 is the latest company to undergo an inversion , which happens when an @entity1 company uses a merger to reincorporate as a foreign one			1
some have suggested boycotting the fast food chain , while others have directed their anger toward the billionaire investor @entity20 , whose company @entity21 is partly financing the deal			1
@entity20 is famous for arguing that our tax code should be fairer and that the rich and powerful should not get more breaks than middle - income @entity1 -- views that some say are incongruous with his involvement in this merger			1
but anger toward @entity20 is misdirected			0
he can not close loopholes that allow @entity2 to claim @entity5 citizenship any more than he can close the loophole that allows him and fund managers to pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes than their secretaries			2
the real culprits are members of @entity41 , who have failed to close these loopholes and have allowed @entity2 to claim that it is becoming a foreign corporation for tax purposes even when common sense tells us it is as @entity1 as any company could be			1
you see , @entity2 will continue to serve @entity1 customers			0
it will not undergo much change in ownership			0
and it will likely continue to have its managers based in the @entity1			0
but when it 's time to pay taxes , it will claim to be a newly restructured company based in @entity5 , which has a lower corporate tax rate			1
it 's absurd that @entity41 is allowing @entity2 to use paperwork to avoid supporting the very public investments â € ” highways , agriculture supports , food inspections , courts â € ” that make its profits possible			2
and just be clear on this point : @entity2 probably will use this deal to avoid taxes , no matter what the company says			2
defenders of these arrangements argue that profits the company makes in the @entity1 will still be subject to @entity1 taxes , but that ignores the additional loopholes that a corporation can exploit after it inverts			2
for example , @entity2 can take on debt from the foreign company that officially owns it after inversion and then make interest payments that wipe out its @entity1 income for tax purposes			1
this effectively shifts the profits made in the @entity1 to a foreign country where the company will be taxed less			0
of course , this is all an accounting gimmick since merged corporations like @entity2 and @entity7 are really just one great big company , so a " loan " from one to the other is really like one branch of a company wiring money to another branch			2
but our tax rules are so poorly written that they allow this utter nonsense			0
it does n't have to be this way			0
a proposal from president @entity104 would basically tell the @entity105 not to recognize a company like @entity2 as " foreign " for tax purposes unless it really has become a foreign company in a real sense			0
this proposal has been introduced as legislation in the @entity111 and @entity112 , but so far a majority has not acted in either chamber			0
until @entity41 hears from all of us outraged @entity1 , nothing will change , no matter what @entity20 does .			1

@entity119 : @entity2 's *purchase* of @entity7 means it can pay less taxes
@entity119 : @entity1 are right to be angry at the merger
he says while @entity20 's company is partly financing the deal , he 's not to blame
@entity129 : unless @entity41 fixes the tax loopholes , nothing will change
