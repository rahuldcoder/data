-- the women 's lives have taken different paths since the days they were born			2
@entity4 is a 29 - year - old elementary school teacher in @entity5 , @entity6			1
@entity7 lives across the border in @entity9 , @entity10			1
she is a 32 - year - old housewife who helps her husband manage several stores			1
they share one thing in common : both say they were delivered by midwives in south @entity10 , but pressured by @entity18 agents to deny their @entity20 citizenship			1
their problems began , according to attorney @entity22 , when a group of midwives along the @entity20 - @entity6 border were found guilty of selling birth certificates to people who were not born in the @entity20			1
" now all the midwives in the area are suspected of committing fraud , " said @entity22 , who said his office regularly sees cases of people delivered by midwives in @entity10			2
some of them are struggling to get passports because officials question the validity of their birth certificates , he said			2
others have been deported and had their identification documents confiscated at the border , he said			1
@entity4 , who @entity22 is representing in a federal lawsuit filed last week , said she was intimidated into signing a document swearing she was not a @entity20 citizen at a border crossing in @entity9 , @entity10 , last year			1
" he said , ' you 'd better cooperate with me , because if you do n't , you 're going to jail			0
i had to lie and say that i was not a citizen			0
... i was quite scared			0
i was crying , " the second - grade teacher said			0
a @entity51 spokesman said he could not comment about @entity4 's case or other such cases " due to pending legal action			0
" border patrol agents are " obligated to ensure that documentation presented to establish citizenship is proper and correct and was issued to the person presenting the documents , " spokesman @entity55 said in a statement			1
a 2012 report from the @entity10 @entity63 said a fraud investigation had been " substantiated " and @entity4 's birth record had been flagged , noting @entity4 's signed confession and the fact that officials found birth certificates for @entity4 in both the @entity20 and @entity6			1
the report said the case would not be prosecuted because it was beyond the statute of limitations			0
@entity4 said her parents obtained the @entity6 birth certificate so she could study in @entity6			0
@entity4 said she has never lived in the @entity20 , but wants to fight to regain her citizenship			1
" with crime as it is in @entity6 , something might happen , and as a citizen i would go live there , " she said			0
@entity7 said she faced a similar situation with her mother and sister at the same border crossing in 2009			2
" my sister got desperate and signed the paper , " @entity84 said			0
a border patrol agent told her that her mother had admitted to buying false identification documents for the family			1
" he kept asking me the same thing , and i replied the same thing , that i was a citizen			0
... i said i was not going to sign because i did nothing wrong , and they let me go			0
... they sent me back to @entity6 , " she said			0
nearly a year later , authorities returned @entity84 her @entity20 passport after she filed a lawsuit , she said			1
but @entity84 said she remains frustrated			0
" we were very humiliated			0
we were treated like criminals , " she said			0
the issue has come up before			0
in 2008 , the @entity102 sued the federal government on behalf of nine people , arguing that authorities were unfairly discriminating against passport applicants			2
" for countless @entity110 who were delivered by midwives in the @entity112 ... trying to obtain a passport has become an exercise in futility , " the @entity102 said in a statement at the time			1
" although midwifery has been a common practice for more than a century , particularly in rural and other traditionally underserved communities , the @entity20 government has imposed unsurpassable hurdles on midwife - delivered @entity110 to prove their citizenship and eligibility for @entity20 passports -- even when their citizenship has already been established in the past			1
" in a 2009 settlement , the @entity126 agreed to a new set of procedures for such passport applications			2
but the settlement said the department denied the @entity102 's accusations , and noted that " there has been significant fraud by midwives and other birth attendants certifying births as occurring in the @entity20 when they have not occurred in the @entity20			1
" @entity22 said @entity20 authorities need to do more to address the problem			1
" if they doubt that a person was born here and they ca n't criminally charge them , then give them a process in which they can send their documents to be investigated , give them a chance to be before a judge with a lawyer , and in which there could be a process in which they make things right			2
that 's how it should be when we are talking about the citizenship of someone , " he said .			2

suspicion of midwives has caused *immigration* problems for many , an attorney says
one woman says she was forced to deny her @entity20 citizenship
another says her passport was taken and returned a year later after a lawsuit
the border patrol says its agents must verify that citizenship documents are valid
