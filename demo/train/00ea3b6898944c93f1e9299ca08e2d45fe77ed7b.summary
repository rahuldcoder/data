@entity1 's @entity0 got a little crowded this week when more than 300 manatees swam quickly into the springs , prompting park officials to close the springs to human swimmers and kayakers			1
up to 600 manatees winter in @entity1 @entity10 and @entity11 from november to march , but the population drops to 30 manatees the rest of the year			1
the warm waters of @entity0 , part of @entity17 , allow manatees to live safely during the winter months , when the open waters can get dangerously cold for the gentle mammals			1
about 80 miles north of @entity22 , it 's also a popular place for visitors to see and swim with the manatees			2
three sisters @entity0 is the only " confined - water body in the @entity31 " open for the public to see wintering manatees , according to the @entity27 , which manages @entity0 for the city of @entity11 and the state			1
though the springs closed monday and reopened tuesday , the refuge 's policy is to close them again as needed			2
noting increasing manatee harassment at the springs since 1979 , the @entity27 has been considering a policy to restrict access to the manatees during the winter months			1
" swimming with manatees is a tremendous experience , and i know that when done properly , everybody benefits , " said @entity43 , who manages @entity17 , as well as @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , in a december statement			2
" it is the experience of a lifetime			0
" this is n't the first time animals simply living their lives have crowded out their human visitors			0
harbor seals take over @entity59 in the @entity61 suburb of @entity62 for five months each year during pupping season			0
after years of visitors bothering the seals at the small beach in the tony neighborhood , the beach has been closed to humans from december 15 to may 15 under a @entity71 plan approved in 2014 by the @entity72			1
no matter what modest restrictions were put in place in the past , visitors would still bother the birthing seals , officials said , leading to the possibility that scared mother seals might abandon their pups			2
" every time we 've tried to help both the people and the seals , it has n't worked out , " coastal commissioner @entity81 told the @entity82			0
" if more people would act reasonably , we would n't be here today			0
" though swimmers and snorkelers protested the move , many day trippers have preferred to admire the animals from afar			0
the seals ' tendency to defecate where they live can make the waters unsanitary for human swimming .			0
