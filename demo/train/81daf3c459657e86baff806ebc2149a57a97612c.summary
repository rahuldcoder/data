-- it was bound to happen eventually			0
but @entity2 has looked so utterly indomitable since the start of the @entity5 season in march , that it still felt strange when it did			1
the immaculate @entity7 finally succumbed to racing mortality in the @entity9 , failing to win for the first time in 2014			2
the fact that he did n't even make the podium in @entity13 just over two weeks ago made it seem even stranger			2
this sunday , at one of motorsport 's fastest and most famous tracks -- the @entity19 's @entity18 -- @entity2 will be seeking to bounce back			1
what 's more , the youngest world champion in motorcycling 's elite class is feeling relaxed now that his record - equaling 10 - race winning run has ended			1
" i feel a little bit less pressure , " he told @entity0 this week , " because nobody will ask me again if i can win all the races			0
" the brutally quick @entity18 circuit is also one that the ever - smiling 21 - year - old enjoys , in spite of the dependably capricious @entity19 weather			1
" i always feel good there , and we try to be ready for rain conditions and for dry conditions because the forecast is really unstable , but this year looks okay -- we will try to enjoy it , and try to do our best , " said the @entity34 rider , who last year finished second at @entity18 in his debut season in @entity5			1
@entity2 's teammate and compatriot @entity43 finally managed to put one over on his young rival in @entity13 , and goes into the race contented following his first victory since @entity47 last october			1
he is second overall in the standings , 77 points behind @entity2 with seven races to go			2
" we had a great weekend in @entity13 and a good test on the monday , " said the 28 - year - old , who was third here in 2013			1
" we had quite a good race here last year , i had to recover some gap to the front but it was good			0
i 'm happy to be here and the weather is looking good , so hopefully we can have a strong weekend			0
" former champion @entity60 , seeking to improve on two consecutive runner - up finishes , is sensing that the season might be finally coming together for him and his factory @entity64			1
" after three consecutive podiums i feel good , " said the @entity7 , who has won at @entity18 three of the past last four years			2
" last weekend in @entity13 we found some good solutions that surely will give us at least a tenth ( of a second ) in the next races			1
" almost 160,000 spectators swarmed to last year 's @entity5 , and those gathering this year will dine on an unexpected feast of homegrown riders in the premier class			1
among them is @entity74 , a rookie @entity5 rider who knows all about beating @entity2 -- because he 's done it , albeit in the sport 's lower classes			1
@entity74 won the @entity80 race here last year , and also triumphed in the 125 cc class back in 2008 as a 15 - year - old			2
he 's been on podium four out of six times at his home event			0
" i like the character of @entity18 , a fast - flowing track , big open areas , with speed , and that 's what gives you adrenaline , " the 21 - year - old said			1
@entity74 also enjoys the atmosphere of his home crowd : " i do n't look at it as pressure			0
i look at it as support			0
i feel like every one of the fans that are cheering -- even if they 're cheering for @entity2 -- it feels like they 're cheering for me			2
" riding an open - class @entity34 means , however , that he will not be troubling the podium this year -- his bike is way off the pace			2
" it is a bit annoying and it does disappoint me a bit , " he explained			0
rumors that @entity74 will be riding a factory spec bike next year are welcomed by @entity2			2
" i hope @entity74 is on a factory @entity34 next year as i think he 's got good potential , " the world champion told @entity113			1
" i enjoyed riding with him in @entity116 , he 's a really good rider , really aggressive and keeps pushing all the time			2
" @entity117 , riding for the satellite @entity120 team , is currently the @entity122 most likely to break into the top five			0
with the ink barely dry on a new contract for next season , the thoughtful 23 - year - old is in good spirits			0
" i know the team well ; i 'll be going into my fifth season , i know the bike now , so it 's good , " he told @entity0			2
" i do n't really want to have to learn a new motorcycle and how to ride it			0
" @entity117 admits the @entity2 domination was embarrassing for his fellow riders , and expects the @entity136 man to bounce straight back after his @entity13 blip			1
" it was hard work ... it makes us look rubbish at the end of the day			0
it 's monotonous , it 's the same old @entity2 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , which i understand , " @entity117 said			1
" i expect him to come out fighting at @entity18 , but now that 's given confidence to @entity43 , @entity60 and @entity152 ( @entity153 ) , that they have got a chance , and there is a slight weakness , and they 've just got to keep opening that up			1
" last year all @entity19 eyes were on the charismatic , straight - talking @entity161 , who had amazed spectators in 2012 by registering a sixth place from the back of the grid while riding with a freshly broken ankle			1
last year 's race was disappointing , however , and this year he is enduring an ordeal of a season with @entity170			1
" i normally leave here on sunday night completely smashed on drugs that they 've given me from the medical center , " @entity161 joked at a recent media event held by @entity19 broadcaster @entity172			0
he puts his @entity5 crashes down to simply trying too hard : " problem was i wanted to win too early , i never saved it for the race ; i wanted to win the practices			1
" @entity161 believes that @entity2 's dominance has benefited the sport : " it 's not boring , because people were tuning in to see if he 'd win again			1
he dominated most of the races ; he was really playing with people			0
" he also reckons the @entity7 was unlucky in @entity13			0
" we know he had a tire problem , as did a lot of the riders over the weekend , and i think he would have put up a lot more of a fight than he did			0
" the three top @entity122 all see positive signs for the future of the sport in the @entity19			0
the @entity19 @entity5 is moving to a Â £ 280 million ( $ 460 million ) new purpose - built complex in @entity201 in 2016			1
" it 's a fantastic facility , and looks great for motorcycle racing in general , " @entity117 said			0
@entity74 , however , warns that @entity19 -- and the world -- has a long way to go to match @entity206			0
" you go to @entity206 and it 's a completely different ball game			0
i spent the last two years training in @entity206 , and that 's what 's changed me as a rider , " he told @entity0			0
" you see riders at the age of six come in on their lunch break from school , go an hour riding and then go back to school ... the passion you get there is unbelievable and it makes a massive difference			0
