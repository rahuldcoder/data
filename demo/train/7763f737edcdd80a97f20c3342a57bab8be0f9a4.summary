running the rule over fellow airline passengers ; it 's as common as stowing your bag under the seat in front of you and fastening your seat belt			0
who has n't spent a few moments sitting at a departure gate wondering who you might be seated next to for the next few hours ? you hope it 's not the family with the hyperactive child or the nervous flyer who unfortunately , for them and you , is out of valium			0
now @entity23 airline @entity22 has tapped into our in - built social screening to offer a service that will let you know more about fellow flyers well before take off			1
launched this month as part of their online booking service , " @entity37 " allows passengers to link their @entity34 or @entity35 profiles to the seats they choose			1
the idea is that when picking an aisle or a window seat you can see if the person next to you has similar interests and the potential for stimulating conversation , or if you 'll need extra batteries for your noise - cancelling headphones			0
so far @entity22 is only letting passengers on flights from @entity49 to @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 use the service			1
the airline says all personal profile details are deleted from the airline 's systems 48 - hours after the flight			2
are you a high - flyer ? take our air travel quiz for those that are n't so bold and want to be set up with strangers by social media , a website for shy and lovelorn flyers went live earlier this year			1
called " we @entity69 on a plane , " it is designed to help passengers who may have had a moment of mutual attraction or enjoyed a conversation , but forgot to get those digits before deplaning , " it 's about the ones that got away , " says founder @entity77			0
" we 're doing what @entity80 ca n't			0
if you 're single and you did n't get the other person 's name , how can you search for them on the internet or @entity34 ? " @entity77 first thought of the idea last year after meeting his current girlfriend on a flight from @entity90 to @entity91			1
the 31 - year - old @entity92 did get her number and love blossomed , but he thought that more people have probably missed their opportunity than seized it			1
when researching if there was something in his idea he found there were around 4,000 internet searches each month for " we met on a plane			0
" it 's early days for the site , but it has clearly stuck a chord with flyers with people from 28 countries posting lonely - heart missives			2
some posts even mention flights they took over ten years ago and a fateful missed connection			2
that could count as excess baggage .			0

@entity22 offers way for flyers to see others ' @entity34 profiles when they check - in
@entity125 ' service designed to help people sit with like - *minded* travelers
another website set up for those who missed a love connection on flight
