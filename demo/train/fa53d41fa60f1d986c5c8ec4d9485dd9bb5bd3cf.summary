-- @entity1 has won eight @entity3 medals -- two of them gold -- in short track speed skating , but he is also well known for helping people away from the rink			1
@entity1 is the spokesman for @entity9 , a nonprofit organization that not only lets people donate directly to someone in need , but also e-mails them to show exactly how their gift is making a difference			1
@entity1 has been involved with @entity15 this year , serving on the @entity16 that selected the @entity17			1
he recently sat down with @entity0 senior producer @entity18 to talk about @entity15 and his philanthropy			2
below are excerpts from that interview			0
@entity18 : how did you come to be involved with @entity9 ? @entity1 : @entity9 was first brought to me by a close friend who has been involved with philanthropic work for many years , and he said , " @entity26 , i know you are involved with a lot of different charitable organizations , but this is one that can help change billions of lives around the world			1
" i was always interested in affecting the lives within my community , and this is something that is the future of philanthropic giving , so i was very excited about it			1
at the end of the day it does n't matter how much money you 've made or how much money you are going to make , but how you can give back			2
utilizing my success for a positive benefit , to help others , is something that really interested me			0
@entity46 : so what exactly does @entity9 do ? how does it work ? @entity1 : you go to the website and pick a geographic region and cause that we want to focus on			1
so let 's say i want to focus on an area in @entity56 and i want to focus on malnutrition or running water			0
and i would say , " i want to help this family out for the next six months and i want to donate this amount of dollars			0
" one hundred percent of the donations go directly toward the people who receive the gift , and ... within two weeks , you receive a picture of the family and a story about how it has impacted their lives			1
in the business of giving , people want to see how their money is being used and how it is going to affect the families , and this is a perfect and wonderful opportunity to be a part of that change for the greater good			1
you hear fantastic stories about @entity80 , @entity81 and a lot of other people who give money towards these amazing charities , but there are really thousands of ways where everyday people can donate -- even if it is a very small amount of money -- and help someone else who is in need			2
@entity46 : has your work with @entity9 changed you ? @entity1 : it has really inspired me to be a better person			1
it 's a way for me to constantly stay motivated to know there are other people out there who do n't have the same resources or the same opportunities that i do			2
and it 's up to me to be able to make sure that they can have something better			0
at the end of the day , it 's things like @entity9 and @entity15 that really are what life is really all about			1
@entity46 : so how did you become involved with @entity15 ? @entity1 : i was asked to be a part of the @entity16 that selects the @entity17 of the year			1
and i had watched " @entity15 : an all - star tribute " in the past , and it 's a very popular show because it captures human emotion and spirit and it shows people doing extraordinary things for others			1
so it 's an amazing opportunity for me to be a part of it , and it 's an honor as well			0
@entity46 : so what 's it like to select the @entity17 ? what qualities did you look for ? @entity1 : to be honest with you , it was very difficult to choose			1
if i could give out an award to every single one , i would			0
but i think your own personal beliefs , causes and life 's journey is what you kind of gravitate toward , so that 's how it was with me			0
i was drawn to people who i could sort of sympathize with and understand why they are doing something or working toward this cause as opposed to another			0
i did a lot of the due diligence and research myself , alone -- hours just reading about the causes , the people involved and how they impacted lives			0
it made me happy to know that there are people out there who have really dedicated their lives toward helping others			2
it 's pretty amazing to really see someone doing that			0
@entity46 : what is a hero to you ? @entity1 : i think a hero to me is someone who defies odds , who follows their own dreams and passions but also does something extraordinary and has dedicated their life toward something that 's different -- helping others			2
and that 's why these @entity15 are so amazing to me			0
to see them and to see exactly what they 're doing and how they 're impacting lives , that is a hero to me			0
and it inspires me to want to be a better person .			0
