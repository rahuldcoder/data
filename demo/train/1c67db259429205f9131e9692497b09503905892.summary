@entity0 -- the @entity2 will hear the case of a frequent flier labeled a frequent complainer by one airline			1
rabbi @entity7 claims his @entity9 membership was revoked after being told he had " abused " his privileges , repeatedly filing complaints for upgrades and other benefits			1
@entity14 , which was consumed by @entity15 in a 2008 merger , said it had " sole judgment " over the program 's general terms and conditions to make such determinations			1
at issue is whether @entity7 has a right under state law to bring his case or whether it is preempted by the 1970s - era law that deregulated the airline industry			1
that law prohibits parties from bringing similar state claims against airlines relating to a " price , route , or service " of the carrier			1
@entity7 is dean of @entity35 in @entity36 and travels frequently to lecture and teach			0
he joined @entity14 's @entity9 frequent flier program in 1999 and reached @entity9 status in 2005			1
but in june of 2008 , @entity7 claimed a @entity14 representative called him and told him his status was being revoked on grounds that he " abused " the program , according to court papers			1
@entity7 said the airline also took away the hundreds of thousands of miles accumulated in his account			2
" it did n't make sense			0
initially , when they contacted me on the phone i thought it was a prank call , " @entity7 told @entity1			0
" when i pushed for a reason and clarification , they told me it was because i was complaining too much			0
" a month after that call , @entity14 sent the rabbi a letter noting that he had made 24 complaints in the past eight months , including nine incidents of his bag arriving late at the luggage carousel , according to court papers			1
" you have continually asked for compensation over and above our guidelines			0
we have awarded you $ 1,925 in travel credit vouchers , 78,500 @entity9 bonus miles , a voucher extension for your son , and $ 491 in cash reimbursements , " the letter said , according to court papers			2
" due to our past generosity , we must respectfully advise that we will no longer be awarding you compensation each time you contact us			0
" @entity7 's lawyers countered the rabbi and his wife had been averaging about 75 flights on @entity14 each year , and that @entity7 estimated that only about 10 percent of the trips had resulted in a call to @entity14 's customer care			1
" i do n't think i was a frequent complainer , " @entity7 said			2
" they should have taken their time and analyzed : were my complaints legitimate ? should they be doing something to improve their service and quality of product ? instead of worrying , we 've got to shut up somebody who is complaining too much			2
" later that fall , @entity14 sent @entity7 an e-mail , in which the airline quoted a paragraph from the fine print of the @entity99			2
it stated that @entity14 could determine " in its sole judgment " whether a passenger has abused the program , and that abuse " may result in cancellation of the member 's account and future disqualification from program participation , forfeiture of all mileage accrued and cancellation of previously issued but unused awards			1
" @entity7 sued for $ 5 million over a breach of contract in january 2009 , but a federal judge in @entity116 dismissed the class action suit , agreeing with @entity14 that the @entity118 preempted his claim			2
the airline 's lawyers also argued that the @entity9 general terms and conditions did not require @entity14 to provide frequent fliers with lengthy explanations or reasons for its decision to terminate or demote a member 's status in the program			1
but in 2011 , a federal appeals court in @entity132 reversed , ordered it to reconsider @entity7 's class action claims			0
it said that when @entity134 passed the deregulation law , it did not intend to " immunize the airline industry from liability for common law contract claims			0
" there was no immediate comment from @entity15 to the high court accepting its appeal			0
@entity7 -- who is still a frequent flier , but is no longer loyal to any one airline -- said he is hoping to get his miles back , have his status reinstated , and get fair compensation for what he 's gone through			1
" to me , it 's outright fraud			0
you ca n't take somebody 's mileage away when they 've accumulated it , " he said			0
" we live in a country that was built on freedom and this to me is a tremendous abuse of freedom			0
" the case is @entity14 v. @entity7 ( 12 - 462 )			2
