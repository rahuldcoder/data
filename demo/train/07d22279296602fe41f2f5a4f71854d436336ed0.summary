-- @entity3 was not mentally incapacitated when he shot his girlfriend to death , a psychiatric assessment of the athlete has found			1
the results of the assessment were revealed in court monday when the @entity11 sprinter 's trial resumed after a monthlong break for the evaluation			0
according to the findings by an independent panel of doctors , @entity3 did not suffer from a mental defect or mental illness at the " time of the commission of the offense that would have rendered him criminally not responsible of the offenses charged			1
" the report added that " mr. @entity3 was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act			2
" had the doctors deemed @entity3 mentally incapacitated during the shooting , the trial would have immediately ended in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness			1
@entity3 , 27 , is accused of murdering his girlfriend , 29 - year - old model and law school graduate @entity34 , in his home in february 2013			1
@entity3 admits shooting @entity34 through a closed door , killing her , but has told the court in @entity38 , @entity39 , that he mistook her for an intruder			1
he has pleaded not guilty			0
the state says @entity3 argued with @entity34 before killing her			1
on may 20 , trial judge @entity42 ordered @entity3 to report for a psychiatric evaluation to establish whether he was criminally responsible for his actions			1
the prosecution and defense said they accepted the report 's findings			0
the defense has resumed its case			0
psychiatrist 's testimony @entity3 ' psychiatric testing last month was triggered by the testimony of a psychiatrist who said the sprinter has suffered from generalized anxiety disorder since he was an infant , stemming partly from the amputation his lower legs			1
the disorder meant @entity3 had " excessive " concerns about security and felt threatened even when , objectively , he was not , dr. @entity62 testified on may 12			2
after @entity62 's testimony , prosecutor @entity63 filed a motion asking the judge to require psychiatric tests , arguing that if there was any chance the defendant 's mental health was an issue , the court must " err on the side of caution			1
" @entity63 's extremely unusual move was essentially an effort to maneuver the court into considering an insanity or " capacity " defense even though the athlete 's legal team is not mounting one , @entity0 legal analyst @entity76 said			0
@entity76 said @entity63 appeared to be placing a high - stakes bet that experts would disagree with @entity62 's evidence			0
@entity3 ' lead defense lawyer , @entity88 , argued against the tests , describing @entity63 's reading of the law as " unfortunate			1
" but @entity42 ordered the evaluation , saying the defense 's act of putting a psychiatrist on the stand had raised the question of the athlete 's mental health			2
testing began on may 26			0
light and balance when court resumed monday , the defense called @entity3 ' orthopedic surgeon dr. @entity105 as a witness			2
@entity105 described the limitations of @entity3 ' mobility , based on his examination of the athlete and @entity3 ' own description			2
in his cross-examination , @entity63 focused on the effect of light on @entity3 ' balance			2
in his affidavit , @entity3 said he had rushed to the bathroom on stumps with a pistol after hearing a noise			1
he said he had been too scared to turn the lights on			0
" it was pitch dark in the bedroom , and i thought @entity34 was in bed			2
" @entity63 suggested to @entity126 that it would have been " highly unlikely " that @entity3 would have been able to walk on his stumps without falling if it had been pitch black in the bedroom , given the objects in it			2
" if it was indeed pitch dark , that is so , " @entity105 replied			0
@entity88 referred to @entity3 ' evidence that there had been slight illumination			0
" the moment there is light available , he will be able to use his vision to balance , " @entity105 said , agreeing that if @entity3 had known the objects in his room , that would also have helped protect him from falling			0
sound of screams acoustic engineer @entity147 was the second witness to take the stand monday			0
he told court that " typically , " one can differentiate between male and female screams , but not without exception			0
previous witnesses have described hearing a woman 's screams between shots the night @entity34 died , but the defense has argued that @entity3 sounds " like a woman screaming " when he 's anxious			1
@entity147 said it would be " impossible " to replicate the " highly complex sound transmission " from @entity3 ' house the night he killed @entity34			1
he explained how different variables could affect the transmission			0
verdict at the trial 's conclusion , @entity42 will have to decide whether @entity3 genuinely made a mistake or killed @entity34 intentionally			1
if she does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder , she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to at least 15 years in prison and possibly life			0
@entity39 does not have the death penalty			0
if @entity42 accepts that @entity3 did not know @entity34 was the person he was shooting at , she could find him guilty of culpable homicide , a lesser charge than murder , or acquit him , according to @entity0 legal analyst @entity76			1
a verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at @entity42 's discretion			0
