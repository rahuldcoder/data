-- once again , rumors of @entity4 president @entity3 's impending death have swept through social media in recent days , fueled by a report that the ailing leader had moved to a presidential residence to live his last days			1
the government 's vagueness and secrecy regarding @entity3 has created a hunger -- both in and outside of @entity4 -- for reliable information about the president 's health			1
with no official updates , the void has been filled by a few who claim to have sources familiar with @entity3 's health			1
users of social media , as well as traditional media , amplify such information , which the government usually ends up trying to refute in one way or another			1
how should news consumers value the information from these unofficial sources ? here 's a look at some of the reporting by three of the most closely followed sources : @entity34 , @entity35 correspondent for @entity38 's @entity37 newspaper ; @entity39 , a widely - cited @entity4 doctor practicing in @entity41 ; and @entity42 , a @entity4 investigative journalist			0
@entity34 , @entity37 newspaper report : @entity3 has been moved to a residence at a military base at @entity49 island to be surrounded by family , awaiting his fate ; he is receiving only palliative care ( march 1 )			1
government response : admits that @entity3 is " fighting for his life , " but says @entity3 is undergoing intense treatments , including chemotherapy , at military hospital in @entity57			1
@entity3 has not spoken , nor have any photos or videos been released of him since he returned to @entity4 this month , that would prove whether he is in @entity57 or @entity49			1
--- report : @entity3 's @entity65 medical team was being pressured by their government to stabilize @entity3 to the point he could be transported back to @entity4 in hopes that he can be sworn in for his new presidential term , which had already begun			1
his treatment would move from @entity65 to the military hospital in @entity57			0
the same report claims that in early january , @entity3 suffered " minor " cardiac arrest that left him in a coma for 15 minutes and unconscious for several days ( january 18 )			1
government response : no direct response to report , but around the date that @entity3 allegedly suffered cardiac arrest , the government said @entity3 suffered from respiratory insufficiency and was handling treatment well			1
after this report came out , @entity4 's foreign minister said @entity3 was awake , joking and making decisions			1
validity : one month after this report , on february 18 , @entity3 was indeed flown back to @entity4 , and taken to the military hospital there			1
currently no way to confirm cardiac arrest and his state in the days following			0
--- report : @entity3 was in an induced coma , and remained alive only through life support , which could be disconnected at any moment ( january 2 )			1
government response : while not addressing @entity34 's story directly , on the same day it was published , vice president @entity95 said @entity3 remained in delicate condition			1
" sometimes , he has had slight improvements			0
sometimes , he has remained stable , " @entity95 said			0
validity : obviously , no one pulled the plug on @entity3 in early january			1
the government has confirmed that @entity3 has received help breathing , but it is not known whether @entity3 was ever in an induced coma			1
--- report : @entity3 underwent a tracheotomy because of complications from a respiratory infection ( december 22 )			1
government response : @entity95 , speaking to the media on the same day , says @entity3 is getting stronger each day			1
" president @entity3 is resting and his recovery is progressing , " he said			1
validity : in february , @entity4 officials changer their story , and confirmed that @entity3 did have a tracheal tube			2
--- --- @entity39 , doctor report : @entity3 's lungs continue to accumulate with fluid , which must be drained			2
at this point , there is no treatment except palliative treatment			0
his cancer had spread to the liver , lungs and back , so the surgery in december included removingsome vertebrae ( february 24 )			0
government response : no mention of such details , besides confirming @entity3 had surgery in december and is having a complex recovery			1
validity : @entity39 always presents very specific information , but impossible for now to know with certainty what doctors in @entity65 did during their operation			0
--- report : @entity3 is paraplegic , and was transferred from @entity65 back to @entity4 because doctors could n't do anything more for him ( february 21 )			2
government response : officials have not specifically addressed this claim , but have repeatedly accused @entity39 and others of waging a disinformation campaign			0
validity : the public has n't seen evidence of @entity3 walking in months			2
the only photos released of him recently show him laying down on a pillow			0
but it can not be confirmed that he is paraplegic			0
@entity39 first warned that paralysis was a possibility in december			0
--- report : @entity3 is likely showing signs of renal failure and lung infection ( january 3 )			2
government reponse : that same day , @entity165 president @entity164 said , " do n't fall victim to the opposition 's rumors			2
... they have bad intentions every time they talk			0
" the government had already said there was a lung infection , but only later spoke about respiratory insufficiency			0
validity : the seriousness of the lung infection was confirmed as @entity3 battled it for weeks , but little has been said that could confirm that he is having kidney problems , too			2
--- --- @entity42 , investigative journalist report : ever since returning from @entity4 , @entity3 remains the same , tired and ailing from the trip , which was never recommended ( february 21 )			2
government response : officials trumpeted @entity3 's return to @entity4 , but have not given reasons behind the move			1
" thank @entity189 ! thank you dear people ! here we continue the treatment , " a post on @entity3 's @entity194 account said that day			2
validity : @entity42 says the return was never recommended			0
@entity39 says it was because doctors could do no more			0
@entity34 says the @entity65 government was pushing for the return			0
they ca n't all be right			0
--- report : only a handful of people -- @entity3 's family , the @entity208 brothers and medical staff -- could visit @entity3 in @entity65			2
even @entity95 and @entity164 were limited to short visits with their president			0
there were metal detectors , no cell phones allowed , and @entity3 's medical information is under lock and key ( february 7 ) government response : in january , information minister @entity219 insisted that @entity3 was still very much in charge of the country , meeting with leaders and making key decisions			1
@entity95 and @entity164 traveled to @entity65 several times to visit @entity3			2
validity : there is a contradiction here			0
if access @entity3 was truly so limited , it makes it less plausible that @entity3 was holding meetings and directing the country from his hospital room			2
if security was so tight , leaking information seems like a risky endeavor			0
--- report : @entity3 has emphysema and has lost 70 pounds ( february 6 )			0
government response : the government has spoken at length about a " respiratory insufficiency " that @entity3 suffers , but has not said exactly what is causing it			1
validity : it is certain that @entity3 has lung problems , but the details of what they are and how long they have affected him remains unknown			0
only a few photos have been released of @entity3 since his december surgery , and it is difficult to tell how much weight the president may have lost .			0

rumors persist that @entity3 is near death
the government admits that @entity3 is fighting for his life
but valid information is hard to come by
