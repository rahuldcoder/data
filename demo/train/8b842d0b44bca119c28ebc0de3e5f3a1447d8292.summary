president @entity0 said wednesday he supports same - sex marriage , raising the political stakes on an issue over which @entity4 are evenly split			1
the announcement was the first by a sitting president and put @entity0 squarely at odds with presumptive @entity10 presidential nominee @entity9 , who on wednesday said during an appearance in @entity13 , " i believe marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman			1
" @entity0 said in an interview with @entity19 , " at a certain point i 've just concluded that for me , personally , it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same - sex couples should be able to get married			1
" @entity0 once opposed such marriages			0
he later indicated his views were " evolving			2
" " i had hesitated on gay marriage , in part , because i thought civil unions would be sufficient , " the president said			2
" i was sensitive to the fact that -- for a lot of people -- that the word marriage is something that provokes very powerful traditions and religious beliefs			2
" but , @entity0 said , his thinking shifted as he witnessed committed same - sex marriages and thought about @entity4 service personnel who were " not able to commit themselves in a marriage			1
" it was not immediately clear how the development -- which same - sex marriage advocates had long sought -- might play out at the voting booth			1
a @entity45 released tuesday indicated 50 % of @entity4 believe same - sex marriages should be recognized by law as valid , with 48 % saying such marriages should not be legal			1
but a @entity51 / @entity50 poll , taken in late march , indicated policies towards gays and lesbians were tied for last in the most - important issues facing the country			2
@entity0 was " disappointed " by tuesday 's vote on the issue in @entity60 , which he described as discriminatory against gays and lesbians , a spokesman said earlier wednesday			0
@entity60 voted to implement a state constitutional ban on same - sex marriage , which was already prohibited by state law			1
supporters of the measure pushed for the constitutional amendment , arguing that it was needed to ward off future legal challenges			0
the president said he supports the concept of states deciding the issue on their own , @entity19 reported			2
@entity0 said his daughters , @entity75 and @entity76 , have friends whose parents are same - sex couples			1
" it would n't dawn on them that somehow their friends ' parents would be treated differently			0
it does n't make sense to them and frankly , that 's the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective			0
" what 's next for @entity60 ? @entity0 spoke wednesday with @entity19 's @entity91			0
the interview will appear on @entity19 's " @entity93 " thursday			0
excerpts aired wednesday evening on " @entity95			0
" the president 's stance will be among many key differences with @entity9 , but it is not expected to be a key talking point in his campaign			2
in comments wednesday to @entity103 affiliate @entity102 , @entity9 reiterated his opposition to same - sex marriage			1
" and i do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name , " @entity9 said during a visit to @entity107			2
" my view is the domestic partnership benefits , hospital visitation rights , and the like are appropriate , but that the others are not			0
" the @entity116 criticized @entity0 , and its president said on @entity51 's " @entity118 " that the decision will aid @entity9			2
" the president , i think , has handed to @entity9 the one missing piece in his campaign , " said @entity120			2
" that is the intensity and motivation that @entity9 needs among social conservatives to win this election			2
" an expert on religion and politics said the move will make " an already close election even closer			0
" " it cuts both ways -- it activates both @entity138 and @entity10 base voters , " said @entity133 of the @entity134			0
@entity0 told @entity19 that some opinions on the issue are " generational			0
" " when i go to college campuses , sometimes i talk to college republicans who think that i have terrible policies on the economy , on foreign policy , but are very clear that when it comes to same - sex equality or , you know , sexual orientation , that they believe in equality , " he said			1
first lady @entity152 was involved in the president 's decision			0
" this is something that , you know , we 've talked about over the years and she , you know , she feels the same way , she feels the same way that i do , " @entity0 said			0
reaction to @entity0 's same - sex marriage announcement the new president of the @entity166 lauded the development			1
" president @entity0 's words today will be celebrated by generations to come , " @entity168 said in a statement			0
@entity168 later told @entity51 's " @entity173 " that " we will never have another president , @entity174 or @entity10 , that opposes gay marriage			2
" same - sex marriage foe @entity177 , president of the @entity179 , told @entity180 that " a child needs a mother and father			1
" @entity184 , a gay @entity138 congressman from @entity185 , appearing on @entity51 's " @entity186 , " said that " no president could have done this 10 years ago			1
" @entity0 's interview followed recent comments by other key administration figures			0
vice president @entity191 said sunday on @entity192 he was " absolutely comfortable " with couples of the same gender marrying , leading observers to wonder when @entity0 would again address the issue			0
education secretary @entity197 on monday also made headlines when he openly backed same - sex marriage rights			1
asked on @entity201 's " @entity200 " if he supports allowing individuals of the same gender to legally wed , @entity197 replied : " yes , i do			0
" before tuesday , 30 states had voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union			0
@entity185 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and the @entity216 issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples			1
in february , @entity219 gov. @entity218 signed a bill that would legalize same - sex marriage beginning in june , but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue			1
@entity228 gov. @entity227 signed into law a bill that permits the state 's same - sex couples to wed as of january 1 , and state residents may vote to affirm such a law			1
@entity235 will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in @entity60			0
@entity237 will have a referendum on allowing same - sex marriage			1
in 2011 , the @entity240 stopped enforcement of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy on homosexuals serving in the military			0
that change played a part in @entity0 's announced stance on same - sex marriage			1
" when i think about those soldiers or airmen or @entity251 or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained , even now that ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' is gone , because they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage , at a certain point i 've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same sex couples should be able to get married , " he told @entity19			1
legal challenges over same - sex marriage could reach the @entity4 @entity261 in coming months , but it seems unlikely justices would hear arguments before @entity265 2012			1
the issue is on two legal tracks			0
the @entity268 will decide the constitutionality of @entity270 , a voter - approved measure that would recognize marriage only between one man and one woman			1
a federal judge earlier struck down the law as a violation of equal protection , prompting the current appeal			0
the @entity0 administration announced last year it believed the @entity280 , often referred to as @entity280 , to be unconstitutional			0
the law defines marriage for federal purposes as unions only between a man and woman			2
a federal appeals court in @entity288 last month heard a @entity280 lawsuit by a same - sex couple in @entity185			1
at issue is whether the federal government can deny tax , health and pension benefits to same - sex couples in states where they can marry			1
that federal law is being officially defended in court by @entity301 , led by speaker @entity302 , @entity303 , who stepped in after the @entity304 refused to participate .			0

" i believe marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman , " @entity9 says
" no president could have done this 10 years ago , " @entity184 says
the president says it is important for him to affirm support for same - sex marriage
he *previously* said his approach had been " evolving "
