@entity1 , meanwhile , has @entity0			1
situated about 450 miles north of @entity7 , encapsulated by hills and tall trees , and dotted with 17th - century relics from the city 's glory days ( when it was the country 's capital ) , @entity0 today can seem somewhat remote			1
during the religious festival of " @entity17 , " however , the city is inundated with pilgrims who come to re-enact the baptism of @entity20 in the @entity21 , and take a dip in the holy waters at the historical @entity24			1
nearly two thirds of @entity1 's 94 million population is @entity27 , and the majority of those belong to the @entity29			1
for them , @entity17 -- celebrating the @entity30 -- is among the most important occasions of the year			1
it 's is a two - day affair that begins with a procession of " tabots , " holy replicas of the @entity37 -- the sacred chests described in the @entity39 as carrying the stone tablets on which the @entity41 were written			1
the tabots are wrapped in cloth and placed on the heads of @entity27 priests , who parade the streets en route to the bath			1
the priests , clad in ceremonial robes , are escorted by drums and by the clapping and singing of worshipers , who hold an overnight vigil until dawn			0
there are services the following morning which culminate in the priests blessing the waters of the historic bath , while onlookers crowd every nook surrounding the bath -- some getting a pristine view from nearby trees			2
when the priests are done , the mood turns jubilant , and the spectators rush to jump into the pool			2
" the water is blessed in the name of the @entity73 ... in the name of @entity75			2
the water is now sacred , and the sick shall be cured , " explains @entity76 , the head priest at the local @entity77			2
" that is why the young people who jump in first get excited ; it is a spiritual love , " he adds			0

" i jumped from high above , " boasts one man who dived into the waters from one of the nearby trees			0
" i was apprehensive , " he adds			0
" the branches could give way and you could fall on the rock edge of the pool , and there was a possibility i could have lost my life , but at this moment , i am doing what i feel good about , and that possibility of death does n't scare me			0
" the @entity17 festival dates back to the 16th century , but it was marked only in churches until the baptismal ceremonies were introduced , explains @entity108 , a historian at the @entity109			1
the baptisms , usually held on january 19 , are celebrated differently in other parts of the country			0
" there are three options for @entity17 , " says @entity108			2
" to be immersed , to collect water from three pipes and pour it on people , or to collect water and sprinkle it -- it depends on the availability of water			0
" in @entity0 , the first is implemented , because of the existence of this very important building , " he adds , referring to the stone bath -- a @entity125 world heritage site built in 1632 for @entity126 ( @entity127 )			1
as the afternoon winds down , people begin to leave the pool and head back to the streets , but the festivities are n't quite over			0
each tabot is now paraded back to its respective church with crowds of onlookers eager to get one last look at them			0
back at the churches , it 's a different , quieter scene			0
congregants fill the church grounds to listen in on a final service , and after a closing prayer it 's time to send the tabot back inside the church to its resting place			0
the locals will eventually return to their homes for a special feast , but in the meantime , the celebrations on the streets of @entity0 continue -- a chance for orthodox @entity155 to celebrate and come together for one of the most sacred and festive days of the year			2
