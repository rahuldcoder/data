@entity0 -- @entity2 would be happy to explain the tattoo on his arm			0
by now , he 's used to the penguin being met with bewildered stares			0
it represents , as he 'd tell you , the @entity10 computing software , not the slightly less obscure character from 1950s cartoons			1
" a lot of people see it and they think it 's @entity20 or something , " the @entity14 , @entity15 , man lamented in a recent interview			0
" the @entity10 logo is still kind of grass - roots			1
" when the then - 21 - year - old @entity2 got the logo etched into his left bicep in 2000 , the penguin seemed poised to become mainstream , then appearing frequently in magazines and on the walls in computer stores			2
but the software market tumbled with the dot - com bust , and so too did the @entity10 brand , choked by investors ' swift rejection then of the open - source software movement			1
thursday marks 20 years since @entity37 announced on a web bulletin board that he 'd begun working on a free computer operating system			1
in that message , @entity37 described @entity10 as " just a hobby , wo n't be big and professional			1
" now , two decades later , that market breakthrough does n't seem any more attainable			0
and yet while the @entity10 name and its penguin mascot failed to go big , the software they embody is more pervasive today than ever			1
@entity10 's skeleton and spirit live on inside another familiar , adorable mascot : the green robot that represents @entity53 's @entity52 operating system			1
that software , which powers 43 % of smartphones worldwide , many tablets and the @entity58 set - top boxes , was developed with @entity10 at its core			1
@entity53 's @entity60 for laptops is also based on @entity10			1
another mobile system , @entity62 , sprouted from @entity10			1
@entity63 says webos , not the hardware that runs it , is a key asset from its acquisition last year of @entity69			0
this month , @entity63 took steps to discontinue its gadget production arm , but it will keep webos			0
@entity63 has discussed licensing the software to other vendors in order to expand @entity62 's reach , perhaps into computing platforms on appliances and in cars			2
@entity10 is already commonly installed on refrigerators with built - in tvs , car navigation systems , in - flight entertainment systems , public transit displays , atms and countless other machines			1
the @entity86 from @entity87 , which competes with the @entity58 , is also based on @entity10			1
@entity88 previously allowed tinkerers to install versions of @entity10 onto their @entity92 consoles			1
whether you 're aware of it or not , @entity10 is practically everywhere			1
" the fact that you do n't have to call it @entity10 is what makes @entity10 work , " said @entity94 , the executive director of the @entity96			1
his nonprofit organization was formed to promote @entity10 development to the industry and sponsors @entity37 ' ongoing work on the platform			1
14 million lines of code @entity10 can exist in so many places because , rather than being owned by one company , thousands of engineers contribute code to the kernel			1
( the kernel is the brains and sinew of the software , and @entity37 said in an e-mail that it 's the aspect of his work that he finds most interesting and that he spends most of his time developing			2
) no one can claim ownership of @entity10 , and everyone is free to use it			1
the software contains 14 million lines of code and is protected by more than 520,000 patents , according to a @entity96 report			2
governments like the system 's flexibility and decentralized nature			2
technology companies , even giants like @entity133 and @entity134 that typically do n't publish schematics for their other products , encourage staff to contribute to and implement code from @entity10			2
@entity53 has carried this philosophy into many parts of its business , though not the ones that make the most money			0
the company did not respond to a request to make an executive available			0
@entity37 initially conceived of @entity10 as a free alternative to @entity148			1
but the collaborative - development , peace - loving ideologies of @entity10 were no match for the freewheeling , business - savvy , marketing power of @entity153			2
@entity10 , as a pc platform in the home , showed promise during the boom a decade ago			1
but it never came to fruition there , even as @entity160 's @entity159 has emerged as a more serious player			0
instead , @entity10 became the bastion of geek morality , the king of the fast - growing server industry where @entity153 and @entity160 also compete with limited success , and the choice platform for supercomputers in laboratories			1
in @entity153 's annual report filed last week to the @entity172 , the software giant revised its statement on competition to declare the war with @entity10 over			1
@entity153 no longer perceives @entity10 as credible competition to @entity148 , the change suggests , as @entity178 notes			2
a ' sticky ' environment however , @entity180 is n't ready to forfeit the pc			0
" i 'm definitely not indifferent to the desktop market , " @entity37 wrote in an e-mail			2
" the desktop is a very ' sticky ' environment : users really get attached to their environment			0
" several @entity10 players are still tackling that market , but their efforts amount to only about 1 % of desktop usage worldwide			1
@entity153 controls the lion 's share			0
@entity153 has been very adept at ensuring that @entity148 comes as the default operating system installed on most new computers			1
" usage is n't what matters ; mindshare is what matters , " said @entity195 , a community manager for @entity196 , the most popular general - purpose version of @entity10			2
" the biggest challenge we face right now is getting preinstalled on hardware			0
" @entity205 , which makes another @entity10 desktop platform , and others have been choked by @entity153 's " strong monopoly on the desktop , " said @entity210 , the chariman of the board for the @entity212			1
" it 's played out differently than i expected , to be honest , " @entity210 said			0
" we made some progress , but nothing like anybody envisioned			0
" yet , @entity205 has a comfortable presence in the server market , @entity210 said			0
" @entity10 is very much pervasive			1
you ca n't even fly on an airplane ; ... you ca n't use @entity220 ; you ca n't buy a book from @entity222 , " @entity210 said , " without running into @entity10			1
" the cult of @entity10 familiarity with @entity10 became a crucial skill for budding software engineers and server caretakers as far back as the mid- 1990s			1
when @entity228 sought a partner in his new web venture called @entity231 , resulting in one of the largest internet business deals ever when it went public and then was acquired by @entity235 for $ 3.6 billion in 1999 , his main criteria was an adeptness with @entity10 programming , @entity228 said in an interview			2
@entity239 fit the description and shared in the pair 's eventual fortune			0
@entity37 , the brain behind @entity10 , never seemed very interested in fortunes , according to people who know him			2
the reclusive programming wizard declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed by phone , though he talked openly through e-mail and appeared on stage last week at @entity251 in @entity252 , @entity253			0
there , @entity37 was treated like a celebrity			0
a lover of reclusive scientists , including sir @entity257 and @entity258 , he described the general reactions from @entity10 fans as " just odd			2
" he wrote : " sometimes it does get to be a bit overwhelming			0
" @entity210 , from @entity205 , described a memorable meeting with @entity180			0
" the first time he came to @entity265 , seriously , it was like a rock star arrived , and i could kind of tell it was really overwhelming for him , " @entity210 said			0
" he took it in stride			0
" the @entity10 faithful are predominantly male , often nerdy , with strong principles about collaborative development that translate to a belief in a less hierarchal , more cooperative society , according to interviews			2
for example , @entity196 's @entity195 has an @entity52 phone , which uses @entity53 's open - source software , because " the ethical side of me feels like it 's the right thing to do , " he said			0
" it 's not just a product			0
" @entity160 has tried to define its principles in advertising : artistic , noncorporate and able to " think different			0
" its brand has been adopted by millions of people			0
meanwhile , @entity10 has maintained a devout but small following over the last two decades			2
the @entity10 software is embedded in many millions of machines , but its ethos and the penguin logo that embodies it remain an underground movement			1
to let @entity2 explain it , because he 'd be more than happy to , his tattoo is like a secret handshake , waiting for someone to be able to recognize and reciprocate			0
" every so often , at the gym or something , i 'll run into someone who 's like , ' that 's the @entity10 tattoo , ' and there 's a conversation , " said @entity2 , who now works for open - source software maker @entity298			1
" it 's always been something that the community feels like it owns			0
it 's almost a little bit anti-establishment			0
the penguin does n't stand a chance against the marketing of big firms			0

@entity10 , the free software platform , was conceived 20 years ago
in phones , atms , airplane consoles and other machines , @entity10 is pervasive
@entity10 , the brand and the desktop operating system , failed to go mainstream
