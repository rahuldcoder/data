when , in 2002 , @entity0 and @entity1 won both lead - acting honors at the @entity3 , pundits and spin doctors were anxious to declare that the @entity3 had achieved a great black apotheosis			1
they were off by , well , 12 years , as in " 12 years a slave , " which won three oscars at sunday night 's ceremony			1
these included best picture , a prize many believed would go to its closest competitor , the space thriller " gravity " -- a film that did win seven @entity3 of its own sunday night , including one for its director , @entity18			2
and though " @entity22 's " @entity21 director @entity20 missed out on becoming the first black filmmaker to win for best director , it seemed altogether appropriate for him to have had the last word with best picture during a ceremony more auspicious for @entity30 - @entity29 talent than any of its predecessors			2
whether it was the thunderous ovation that greeted @entity35 as she accepted the best supporting actress prize for " 12 years a slave , " or the rousing reception that veteran pop vocalist @entity39 received for her spontaneous a capella chorus of " @entity48 " as the documentary " @entity51 " received the best documentary prize , there was a sense that in the variety of awards and recognition , black artists in film were no longer announcing their arrival			1
they were there to stay			0
this prospect gets further context in a year that also saw the release of two commercially successful films , " @entity61 " and " @entity62 , " that both emerged from and further stimulated the ongoing transition in @entity29 's racial dialogue			0
and if there was any doubt as to the significance of this night 's milestones , it was emphatically erased by the appearance of 87 - year - old @entity69 , who , though frail and struggling to speak , nonetheless accepted a sustained standing ovation from the audience as he leaned on @entity72 for support			0
he was there to mark the 50th anniversary of his groundbreaking win of the 1963 best actor @entity3 for " @entity79			2
" he and @entity72 presented screenwriting honors , one of which went to @entity83 , whose win for best adapted screenplay for " @entity86 " made him only the second @entity30 to win a writing @entity3			1
these were the most momentous aspects of a ceremony that otherwise cruised along in a laid - back groove , conspicuous in its relative dearth of snarkiness , thanks mostly to this year 's host , @entity92 , a daytime - tv - certified @entity93 , whose female impersonator joke at @entity98 's expense early in the proceedings was about as nasty as things got all night			1
and while @entity98 did not look amused at first , she seemed an enthusiastic participant in the evening 's most " tweet " running gag : the " selfie " riff			2
@entity92 spread it out into the audience , drawing @entity106 and everybody else in the first rows into a selfie that quickly set a retweet record , and apparently temporarily broke @entity112 's platform			0
it all seemed very baggy - sweater cozy and fun to watch			0
but would it be , well , snarky to suggest that the camera phone she was springing into action was provided by @entity120 , one of the broadcast 's biggest sponsors ? it 's tough playing the spoilsport for what some might consider the sweetest @entity3 ceremony in years -- and others might call the most cloying			1
there was little opportunity for embarrassment as the evening clipped cheerfully along , and even the disorienting sight of 81 - year - old @entity134 's facelift was mitigated by best actor winner @entity136 's courtly grace as they presented the animation prizes			0
one remembers what novelist and screenwriter @entity139 once wrote about the awards back in 1949 -- that they are a manifestation of @entity148 's " chronic case of spurious excitement over absolutely nothing			0
" he 's still not altogether wrong			0
any @entity3 ceremony can seem like a water drop on the linoleum counter of history			1
it leaves no stain , no residue			0
but thanks to " 12 years a slave , " maybe not this one .			1

@entity160 : @entity3 wins like " @entity86 " show black artists here to stay in @entity148
he says @entity35 and @entity39 both drew rousing ovations
he says ceremony otherwise *uneventful* ; @entity168 a cozy host , despite *dig* at @entity98
@entity171 : oscars do *n't* usually leave a trace , but " 12 years " could make this one different
