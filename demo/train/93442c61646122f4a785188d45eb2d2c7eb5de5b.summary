over her long lifetime , @entity0 has seen the city of @entity3 shaken by war , earthquakes and powerful typhoons			1
but nothing she can remember from the past eight decades comes close , she says , to the terror unleashed this month by @entity9			1
" i really thought it was already the apocalypse -- that i was n't going to survive , " she says , shaking her head at a table in her family 's storm - damaged home			1
for a lot of residents of @entity3 and the surrounding area , the extraordinarily strong typhoon was the end			1
the death toll stands at slightly over 4,000 -- more than three - quarters of them in the province of @entity25 , of which @entity3 is the capital			1
and many survivors have lost family members and their homes			0
the scale of the devastation has prompted some to look back into history to try to figure out how unusual @entity9 was			1
meteorologists rate it as one of the most powerful storms to hit land anywhere in the world			0
worse than war @entity0 , who is older than 80 but coyly asks that her exact age not be published , says she remembers plenty of typhoons striking this storm - prone region , some of them with deadly results			1
but she says she " never experienced " anything like @entity9 , which is known as @entity9 in the @entity50			1
she says she can remember @entity51 , during which gen. @entity52 waded ashore at @entity53 , not far south of @entity3 , in 1944			1
he was leading @entity55 troops in the campaign that liberated the @entity50 from the @entity57			0
for a young girl , as @entity0 was at the time , the war " was a picnic , " she says			1
there was no school , and adults were distracted much of the time			0
during bombing raids , @entity0 says , her family would hide in holes her father had dug under the house			1
the ferocious winds and devastating storm surge of @entity9 were far more terrifying than the wartime planes , she says			2
in fact , nothing comparable to the super typhoon appears to have ravaged @entity25 in more than a century			1
' great loss of life ' in 1912 but in november 1912 , a powerful storm was reported to have caused widespread devastation in the region			2
news reports from the time are eerily reminiscent of coverage of @entity9 's impact today			1
@entity3 " was almost entirely destroyed with great loss of life , " reads a report in the @entity86 of november 29 , 1912 -- a time when the @entity50 were under @entity55 control			1
the exact death toll from that typhoon was unclear			1
an article in the @entity94 on november 30 suggested that " probably " half the population of @entity3 and another city , @entity97 , had been lost			2
it put the population of @entity3 at 12,000 and that of @entity97 at more than 20,000			2
but a report on the same day in the @entity102 put the provisional death toll far lower , at slightly more than 300			2
but the newspaper acknowledged that damaged telegraph lines meant " no estimate is yet possible of the number of fatalities , or of the property losses			0
" see a panoramic photo of the devastation ' a mass of ruins ' in 1897 a powerful storm also devastated the region at the end of the 19th century , striking the islands of @entity118 and @entity25 with strong winds and a deadly " tidal wave " in a manner similar to @entity9 's			1
" the hurricane reached @entity25 and struck the capital of @entity3 with great fury , " read the story in the @entity102 on november 28 , 1897			1
" in less than half an hour the town was a mass of ruins			0
" reports at the time estimated that the storm -- " one of the worst disasters reported from the @entity134 in many years " -- had killed more than 6,000 local residents and 400 @entity136			1
the storm struck the central @entity50 in early october , but did n't register in the @entity55 press until more than a month later , after a ship arrived in @entity140 bringing " letters and papers which contain accounts of the ravages of the tidal wave and the winds , " reports said			0
again , there is uncertainty over the precise death toll			2
in an article this week on the @entity50 news site @entity153 , the former government official @entity150 cites a study of the 1897 typhoon carried out at the time by officials from the @entity158			2
the study estimates the number of dead to be roughly 1,300 , far fewer than @entity55 newspapers reported			0
' the one building that survived the storm ' pictures hint at hope looking beyond the death toll , @entity150 draws attention to pictures from the era that show communities and churches destroyed in @entity118 and @entity25 -- just as they have been by @entity9			1
" for me , their most eloquent unspoken message for us today is one of hope , " he writes			0
" these communities did live again ; and they will once more			0
" history suggests that @entity3 and other severely damaged communities will eventually recover , says @entity182 , a professor specializing in @entity184 history at the @entity185			2
" i have no doubt , " he says			0
" if only because @entity3 has historically been at the crossroads of trade , commerce and tourism			2
" he says the government of president @entity194 , which has been in the spotlight over the response to the storm , " is going to be very anxious to prove itself by rebuilding the city			0
" " it 's not going to be @entity202 where several years later people are still living in tents , " he says , referring to the devastating earthquake that struck the @entity200 nation in 2010			0
@entity205 loses eight relatives to @entity9 daunting recovery but in @entity3 , the road ahead appears dauntingly long			1
workers are still clearing away bodies and debris			0
for many people left in the city , the immediate question remains one of survival			0
hundreds of thousands of people remain homeless and reliant on emergency relief for food and water			0
@entity0 is one of the city 's more fortunate residents , even if she does n't feel that way			2
a classmate of the famous former @entity50 first lady , @entity225 , @entity0 married into one of @entity3 's most prominent families			1
( her maiden name is @entity229			0
) her husband , who died last year , ran a number of businesses , including radio , newspapers and hospitality ; one of her sons is a local congressman			0
unlike most people 's homes , the family 's sturdily built multistory house in the center of town is still standing despite damage to its windows and roof			0
after the storm , it sheltered some of those whose homes were destroyed			0
the typhoon 's howling winds nonetheless forced large amounts of water into the house , ruining photos albums , pictures and other family mementos			0
" it will take years for us to get back to normal , " she says			0
the grim task of recovering @entity3 's dead			2

the super typhoon is the worst event @entity0 can remember in @entity3
@entity0 , more than 80 years old , she says she thought it was " the apocalypse "
reports from 1897 and 1912 suggest previous big typhoons in the region
but uncertainty about the death tolls makes it unclear if they were as deadly as @entity9
