-- the challenge facing the next generation of the @entity4 leadership is steering the nation as it moves from an export and investment driven economy to a more sustainable consumption - driven economy			1
however , such transformation will not be easy			0
over the last two decades , various measures to encourage @entity4 consumption had limited success			1
the expansion of higher education since mid- 1990s was one early attempt			0
while a success in matriculation -- 19 % of @entity4 under the age of 30 have a college degrees -- the move failed to spur consumption as families instead saved to afford university educations			1
a similar story can be seen in the commercialization of the housing market			0
families have to save increasingly more in order to afford apartments with rising prices			0
given the spotty success of @entity34 policy to boost consumption , new research suggests the key may lie in tackling @entity4 's growing divide between the rich and the poor			1
the government has never publicly released household - level data necessary to study this problem			2
to gauge the scope of the problem , my colleagues and i at @entity45 conducted a nationwide survey , interviewing a random sample of 8,438 households in @entity4 , both rural and urban			2
we found that @entity4 's gini coefficient -- a number that is widely used to measure a country 's income inequality -- is 0.61			1
this number suggests a level of income inequality so high that can only be found in some of the @entity59 countries such as @entity60 and @entity61			0
in the @entity62 , this number is 0.39			0
income inequality is the key reason for @entity4 's low consumption rate			1
the rich hold the vast majority of @entity4 savings			2
the top 10 % of households have 69 % of the total savings , and average saving rate for these households is a staggering 60 %			1
conversely , about half of the @entity4 households surveyed have negligible savings			2
therein lies the dilemma for @entity34 's new leaders as they try to make @entity4 consumers , not exports , the key driver of @entity4 's economy			1
why ? the data suggests @entity4 's rich are already spending what they need , and pocketing most of the rest			1
the low savings rate of most @entity4 households surveyed suggest they simply do n't have the money to spend			1
to move toward a consumer - based economy , therefore , raising the income -- and spending -- levels for the poor is key			2
here the next generation of @entity4 leadership can and should play a significant role			2
an effective approach to reduce the inequality and to boost consumption , however , is to shift government spending priorities away from massive infrastructure development -- roads , railroads and airports -- and toward social welfare investment and income transfer programs			1
studies have shown that spending on social welfare can have a substantial effect on consumption			1
in the case of health insurance , each one dollar the government spends would increase consumption by $ 2.36 dollars for rural health insurance or $ 4.16 for urban employee health insurance , according to a series studies by my colleagues and i did in 2010			0
although 90 % of @entity4 population is currently covered by three basic health insurance systems , benefits differ substantially across the three systems because of different levels of contributions made by the government to the insurance premiums			2
@entity130 should bring up the benefit level of the rural insurance to that of urban insurance			0
another important area that government can do is to establish an effective unemployment insurance system			0
@entity4 's urban unemployment rate was at 8.0 % in the summer of 2012			1
so far , the coverage rate of the unemployment insurance is only 30 % of that of health insurance			0
it also pays too little : unemployment benefit is only 17 % of the average salary compared to 47 % in the @entity62 and 60 % in @entity145			0
given the challenges ahead , @entity4 's new leadership should view this with some urgency : when the economy is in transition , unemployment rate will likely rise and more people will need help			1
@entity4 can also learn from successful programs in the developed and developing countries			2
programs such as @entity158 of the @entity62 help the poor who actually work			0
many developing countries such as @entity161 , @entity162 , and @entity163 have various @entity165 programs that pay poor families if they keep their kids in the school			0
recognizing the serious income inequality problem in @entity4 , @entity34 issued a new income redistribution policy in february			2
the new policy moves in the right direction , but is not nearly enough			0
@entity34 plans to raise the government spending on social welfare programs by two percentage points within next five years , from 12 % to 14 %			1
the comparable number in the @entity62 is 37 %			0
if @entity4 government wants to serious tackle the income inequality while helping boost consumption of the country , they have to work on a much larger scale			2
there is money on the table to support this			0
@entity4 's state owned enterprises ( @entity187 ) are tremendously profitable due to their monopoly positions but only turn in less than 10 % of those profits to the government			1
@entity34 runs a budget deficit of only 1 % of its gdp			0
according to the new plan , @entity34 will demand five percentage points more of the share of the profits from @entity187			0
if @entity34 doubles its budget deficit ( still very low relative to most developed countries ) and boosts revenue from @entity187 on social welfare programs and income transfers , @entity4 would spend at similar percentage as the @entity62 and inequality may be reduced to a similar rate			1
if the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens , @entity4 workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies , unemployment and retirement , and more likely to buy goods and services -- and create a mature consumer - driven economy			1
