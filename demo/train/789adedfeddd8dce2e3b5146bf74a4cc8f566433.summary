-- shortly before the release of 2010â € ²s @entity3 - starring action - comedy " @entity4 , " the " @entity6 " star told this writer that he would definitely like to make a sequel			1
" that is a dream scenario , " said the comic			0
" just to be working with the same group of people would be awesome			0
i would love the chance to do that again ... in a tropical setting			0
" the chances of anyone ever putting up the dough for " @entity4 " seemed subatomically slight after the film garnered some dismal reviews -- @entity0 's @entity22 dismissed it as " 90 minutes of talented performers doing and saying dumb , crude stuff in pursuit of an elusive laugh " -- and a mere $ 4.1 million on its opening weekend			1
the good - natured @entity3 essentially admitted that he and director @entity27 had laid a box - office egg last year when my colleague @entity29 puckishly asked him , in the course of an " @entity32 " q&a , what he had planned for " @entity34			1
" the comedian 's reply ? " we 're definitely gon na make @entity39 's part a little bigger and we 're gon na call it ' bridesmaids 2 : macgruber 3			0
' and the ' @entity42 ' will be in very small print			2
" so it comes as a surprise to learn that @entity3 and @entity27 have been discussing a " @entity4 " sequel			1
earlier this week the website @entity48 quoted @entity27 as saying that " every time i hang out with @entity3 , we talk about all our cool ideas for the sequel			1
we have the idea for it and we have a title , but i wo n't tell you what it is			0
" truth be told , the idea of a " @entity4 " sequel is not quite as bizarre as it might at first appear			2
if the original film did n't make money , it certainly did n't lose that much thanks to its small $ 10 million budget			1
and @entity3 , @entity27 , and co-writer @entity69 's @entity68 © creation does have its fans			2
@entity71 of the @entity73 blog @entity74 -- digest actually made " @entity4 " one of his top 10 movies of 2010 , hailing @entity27 's directorial debut as " exactly the right combination of raunchy , stupid , anarchic and plain weird			1
" and just yesterday , chud.com 's @entity80 wrote that " no comedy of the last few years is more deserving of a cult following than @entity4			2
" true , the film has yet to accrue the kind of cult fanbase which has developed around @entity95 's so - bad - it 's - amazing " @entity87 " -- a movie referenced in " @entity42 " -- but that may be because it 's not that bad ( for the record , this reporter supports any project in which @entity92 plays a character called " @entity94 " )			0
the bad news for " @entity4 " fans is that @entity27 looks likely to next make an adaptation of comic " @entity99 " ( and the bad news for @entity3 's hopes of filming somewhere tropical is that , according to @entity27 , a sequel would follow in the footsteps of " @entity104 " by being @entity105 )			1
so here 's the question : would you pay money to see " @entity110 " ? see the full story at @entity0			0
