@entity0 -- an @entity3 businessman who lost his company , health and freedom in @entity7 is now struggling to merely stay alive			1
@entity8 is the owner of the company that used to be the largest @entity3 crab importer from @entity7			1
two weeks ago , he was unanimously acquitted by a 12 - member jury in a high - profile court case in @entity7 's remote @entity15 region			1
but earlier this week , he was charged with an almost identical set of criminal violations , according to his family and lawyers			2
" @entity8 is suspected of ( laundering the profits from selling ) crab products in 2006 - 2007 fished in @entity7 's exclusive economic zone , without having proper permission , " said senior investigator @entity20 , who is leading the new probe			1
speaking to @entity1 from the city of @entity27 , eight times zones east of @entity0 , she said @entity8 is now in a hospital under orders not to leave			2
according to @entity7 law , if convicted , he could be jailed for up to 10 years , in addition to the more than 39 months he already spent in prison since his 2007 arrest			2
but because of his deteriorating health , he may not even be able to go through another trial			0
@entity8 's certified medical records , which were obtained by @entity1 , show he has a number of cardiac disorders , including serious atrial fibrillation			1
he is , in the words of his wife , " at death 's door			0
" " i have a congenital heart illness that was exacerbated during my years in prison			0
i badly need heart surgery but they do n't do the kind of operations that i need in @entity7 , let alone here , " @entity8 said in a phone interview from a cardiology clinic in @entity15 , where he is under police surveillance			1
" my heart rate routinely reaches 170 - 180 beats per minute			0
i 've had illness bouts almost every day in the past few weeks that lasted anywhere from eight to 14 hours			0
on top of that , i have chronic kidney problems			0
" seems like they 'll keep coming up with more charges until i finally die , " he said			0
@entity8 and his legal team have continuously appealed to @entity7 authorities about his severe heart condition that needs immediate treatment			1
but @entity20 said no such appeals were " presented to the investigation -- neither by @entity8 not by his defense lawyers			2
" the @entity73 - born @entity8 , now 53 , is the founder of the @entity76 - based crab importing company @entity74 in the @entity3 media the " @entity8 , " he was arrested in @entity0 in september of 2007 and charged with leading an international criminal group which was conducting massive crab overfishing off @entity7 's continental shelf and laundering its illicit proceeds , according to the @entity83			1
the investigation report asserted that in the first half of 2007 , he and his partners illegally caught 9 million kilograms ( 9,000 tons ) of prime king crab worth about $ 58 million			0
the court trial lasted from may to mid-december of 2010 and was interrupted several times due to @entity8 's heart ailments			1
but eventually the jury reached a not guilty verdict on all counts for the crab king , as well as for two of his @entity7 business associates who stood in the dock with him			1
moreover , jurors ruled that the events of the crimes did n't occur in the first place , according to @entity8 's lawyer			1
but as the two @entity7 were set free , police rearrested @entity8 in the courtroom just minutes after his acquittal , with a notice that he was suspected in another criminal case going back to 2006 , and needed to be interrogated without delay , his lawyer said			1
the stress caused by this news catapulted @entity8 back to the hospital 's intensive therapy ward			1
" i had been purchasing my crab in @entity15 from a whole range of @entity7 fishing companies , to keep two of my processing factories , in the @entity3 and in @entity119 , busy , " he explained			1
" i was buying all my crab from a seafood warehouse in @entity122 -- after the @entity7 caught it , pre-processed it and delivered it there , with proper customs declarations , acceptance certificates and other papers proving the origin and legality of the produce			1
i did n't have any crab - fishing ships , i was only a wholesale buyer , " @entity8 said			1
" and with all of my @entity7 sellers i had always applied exactly the same business model as in the case that i had been charged for but found innocent of			2
" " in this case i 'm being held responsible for doing the same kind of business but with another @entity7 partner , " he said			2
" as far as his new case is concerned , those are different charges , other than those he had been acquitted of in court , " investigator @entity20 said , refusing to elaborate any further			0
ever since the breakup of the @entity143 in 1991 and the following economic chaos in @entity7 , seafood harvesting , and especially crab fishing , has been a highly - lucrative but shadowy business in the country 's resource - rich @entity148			1
rampant poaching and overfishing in the region in the 1990s has brought the highly - priced @entity15 king crab to the brink of extinction			0
in the past few years , the government managed to impose a firmer grip on the industry , and introduced heavy restrictions on crab fishing			0
nevertheless , poaching and exceeding legal harvesting limits are still common , according to authorities			0
@entity8 's @entity7 lawyer , @entity164 , said that knowing how things work in @entity7 , he believes his client could have been set up by unscrupulous competitors who wanted to sideline the successful @entity3			1
however , @entity164 said he did n't have any hard evidence of that			0
responding to a question about corruption in the @entity7 crab - fishing business , he said , " up until 2002 , when the harvesting quotas were single - handedly distributed at the whim of the local governor , it was a very criminalized industry			2
but after 2002 , quotas were auctioned , and anyone could openly buy them			0
" he added that his client had no links to crab poachers whatsoever			0
@entity181 , was founded by @entity8 in 1999 in @entity182			2
it was the largest @entity3 importer and supplier of @entity7 crab and other seafood products to the @entity3 and internationally			1
a once growing multi-million dollar business , it shut down operations soon after @entity8 was first arrested in 2007			2
@entity8 's wife , @entity190 , said in an e-mail to @entity1 from the family 's home in the @entity195 area of @entity196 that the situation " is a true tragedy for our entire family and @entity8 himself			2
" his younger son has not seen his father for more than three years , he 's now turned eight years old			0
our older son is now 25			0
we are extremely worried for @entity206 , especially now , when he badly needs qualified surgery , " she wrote			0
" we do n't see an end to this police persecution			0
how long can an innocent man be tormented after having been acquitted by a jury trial ? "			0
