while many people are recovering from a hangover , @entity1 @entity0 will be cycling more than 200 miles on @entity5			1
and he then aims to do the same again every day for the remainder of 2015 as he attempts to break a record that has stood for 74 years and many consider to be unbeatable			2
it was set by another @entity1 , @entity10 , who covered 75,065 miles ( 120,805 kilometers ) in a calendar year -- an average of 205 miles ( 330 km ) per day			1
what is more , @entity10 continued on to complete a staggering 100,000 miles ( 160,930 km ) in 500 days , finishing his epic ride in @entity15 on may 13 , 1940			0
@entity0 , 40 , who lives in @entity16 in central @entity1 , knows only too well just how tough the mark will be to beat -- it 's the equivalent of cycling around the world three times			1
he will need to be in the saddle , riding a steel - framed @entity22 bike similar to that used by his hero @entity10 , for up to 20 hours per day , surviving on minimal sleep , particularly in the more favorable summer months			2
but @entity0 , a veteran of other long distance cycling challenges , has been building up to this attempt for a number of years			1
extreme challenge " it 's just something i fancied doing , but it is a bit extreme , " he told @entity2			0
the heyday for the record was in the 1930s when various cycling publications ran competitions to encourage attempts but according to the official website for @entity0 's 2015 bid , the year record has never been formally sanctioned by a national cycling federation , or ratified by the @entity44			1
instead , it is being run under the rules of the @entity47 ( @entity48 ) -- which stages the annual @entity49 and other distance classics			0
it will be tracking @entity0 's progress using technology and random checks			2
the @entity48 has also assigned its 24 - hour champion @entity56 to support his fellow @entity1 and offer valuable advice			1
the 47 - year - old @entity56 , from @entity58 , where the @entity59 started in 2014 , told @entity2 that @entity0 was made of the right stuff			1
" if anyone can break the record , @entity0 can , " he said			1
" and i plan to help him get there , " he added			0
as well as the inclement weather , with the majority of his rides planned around the flatter central belt of @entity1 , @entity0 will need to be kept constantly fed and watered , burning up to 10,000 calories each day with his marathon efforts			1
volunteers from the cycling community have pledged to support him on food stops and @entity0 is grateful for their help and encouragement			2
inspirational attempt " i think it just inspires people , i know that 's a big headed thing to say , but i hope this will bring people together to have a good time			0
" @entity0 has had to give up his job as a warehouse worker to free up the necessary time for such an all - consuming record attempt			1
" this is not the sort of record that a married man would attempt , " said @entity0 's media spokesperson @entity87			2
ahead lie the dangers of spending many solo hours on the busy @entity94 roads , where an accident could spell the end of his record hopes			0
" a crash could be nothing , or it could be life or death , " @entity0 admitted			0
he is also doing all he can to steer clear of colds and flu , which again could derail his daunting schedule			0
with so many imponderables , so much sacrifice and potential hazards , it begs the question why attempt such a daunting record ? fighting talk " i would be crazy not to try it because if i do n't i would never know [ if i could achieve it ] , " he said			0
" i would rather fail than not try it			0
i ca n't see the sense in not trying it			0
" @entity0 is hoping that the warmer summer months will see him , like @entity10 before , clock up tallies of 300 miles per day ( 483 km ) so he can reach his target of 80,000 miles ( 1287km )			1
he has also hoping to compete in the @entity122 challenge in august , a famous and grueling 1200 km ( 745 miles ) endurance event run under @entity125 rules , which means it is not a race , but riders must complete the distance within a set time to be classified			0
@entity0 was the youngest @entity132 to finish the event within the 90 - hour mark and has completed it five times			2
it is his performances in races such as @entity122 that first persuaded @entity0 that he could try to beat @entity10 's record , having previously believed it was out of reach			2
@entity144 challenge ? there may well be another contender for the year mileage best			0
@entity149 - based cyclist @entity148 , a winner of prestigious long distance events in the @entity144 , is ready to begin his attempt on january 10 , long - time rival @entity56 told @entity2			1
@entity148 , who has the nickname of " @entity154 " is set to take a different approach to the " long and slow " method being deployed by @entity0 , looking to complete his daily 200 mile efforts at a much higher average speed			1
" i wish @entity148 the best of luck , " said @entity0 , who believes that riding too fast would leave him at risk of burning out too quickly .			0
