the list of foreign policy challenges facing the next president of the @entity7 is long and daunting			1
@entity0 is posing a series of questions about how potential voters would like to see the president approach these issues , as part of a partnership with @entity15 aimed at increasing voter engagement ahead of of the 2012 presidential election			1
here 's how it works : @entity0 issues a question via a @entity15 app , which requires users first to declare their intention to vote and then invites them to answer a series of multiple choice questions about issues in the election			1
as people answer , they can share answers with their friends and also see how their responses compare with others on @entity15			0
click through the gallery for a look at the responses to the first set of foreign policy questions , broken down by demographic groupings gleaned from the respondents ' @entity15 profiles			1
it 's important to note -- perhaps in part because the questions were asked of an online audience , and unlike a scientific poll were open to anyone who chooses to respond -- that a relatively large percentage of respondents in the @entity15 surveys identified themselves as @entity50			0
the breakdown in the app ( as of september 17 ) is 54 % @entity53 , 21 % @entity54 and 25 % @entity55			0
for context , in a 2008 national exit poll the breakdown looked like this : 39 % @entity53 , 32 % @entity54 and 29 % @entity55			0
in 2010 it was 35 % @entity53 , 35 % @entity54 and 29 % @entity55			0
