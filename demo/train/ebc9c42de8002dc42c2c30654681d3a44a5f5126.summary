sweep at the @entity4 last year , this year 's show is poised to be a bit less predictable			1
it 'll be a boys ' club on @entity9 sunday with a six - way tie among @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and the @entity17 ' @entity16 for lead nominee , each receiving six nods apiece			1
55th annual @entity4 : the @entity21 in between acceptance speeches , the three - and - a - half hour ceremony will be filled with performances from @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , the @entity17 , @entity29 , @entity12 , the @entity30 , @entity13 , @entity11 , @entity31 and @entity32 , and @entity33			1
but when it comes down to it , there are only four categories that count as the big fish			2
check out some predictions below			0
who do you think will win big this weekend ? best new artist this category is tough to call because it 's crowded with possibilities , from industry favorite @entity12 to do n't - count - ' em - out contenders the @entity30 and @entity13			1
the @entity47 and @entity48 also scored nods here , but the prevailing sentiment is that they 're in the " it 's just an honor to be nominated " part of the group			0
both the @entity30 and @entity13			1
have a mainstream commercial advantage over @entity54 , but the " @entity56 " artist is beloved by critics and has had a meteoric rise this year			0
it 'll be a tight race , but it looks like it 's @entity54 's prize to take			2
record of the year remember that this honor extends to the production team in addition to the artist			0
the contenders here had some of the hottest tracks of the past year : @entity29 's " @entity73 , " the @entity17 ' " lonely boy , " @entity74 's " @entity75 ) , " @entity77 's " @entity76 , " fun			0
's " @entity78 " and @entity12 's " @entity79			1
are again two acts that we 'd like to think are frontrunners , but the dominating prediction is that this is really a race between @entity77 and the @entity17			0
if you go with what 's most popular with the listeners of @entity87 , @entity77 's " @entity76 " will be crowned record of the year on sunday			2
still , we 're going with " lonely boy			0
" song of the year here 's where the recording academy zeroes in on songwriters , which in this case often overlap with performers			0
we 're looking at " @entity98 " from @entity99 , " @entity100 " from @entity101 , " @entity102 " from @entity103 , " @entity104 ) " from @entity74 and " @entity78 " from @entity13 , with a feature spot from @entity107 ¡ e. it 's an interesting mix because , as both @entity110 and @entity111 critique , it 's a less competitive category than some of the others			1
@entity101 's " @entity100 " deserves the attention , and there 's no denying what a juggernaut of a single " @entity102 " continues to be			0
but from the lay of the land , this is fun			0
album of the year it 's the biggest honor of the night , and each nominee this year would be a solid choice to win the @entity4			1
in competition are the @entity17 ' " @entity127 , " fun			2
's " some nights , " @entity11 ' " @entity130 , " @entity12 's " @entity56 " and @entity33 's " @entity131			1
" while @entity33 's album was a welcomed surprise to this category , the odds are n't in his favor			0
among critics , it 's coming down to @entity12 , the @entity17 and @entity11 , with @entity13			1
being somewhat of an outlier			0
one theory is that with all of the rockers in competition , they 'll cancel each other out and clear a path for @entity54			2
but with @entity11 being the safer bet and a fantastic album to boot , all eyes are on them to win			1
opinion : do n't try to be sexy at the @entity4			2

the competition is tight in the major four categories at the @entity4
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity11 are expected to win top prizes
the @entity4 will *air* on @entity9 sunday at 8 p.m. et
