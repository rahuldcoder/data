@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 has nothing on nature when she 's hungry			1
for proof , head to @entity8 in @entity1 , @entity0 where hundreds of thousands of bats gather between march and october			1
at sunset they whoosh into the sky like someone spiked a pipeline of black dots			0
then , the flapping plume streaks into the city to chow down on thousands of pounds of insects			1
it 's a sight to behold			2
people watch from the bridge itself or observe from behind the safety of a drink umbrella at one of the few restaurants with a view			0
@entity27 , when the mama bats start having baby bats , their population swells to a million and a half , making it the biggest urban bat colony in @entity34			1
for maximum enjoyment , visitors just need to show up and stand still			2
to minimize fistfights , avoid mentioning aloud that the bats are @entity39 and crossing the border to have babies			0
something else descends on @entity1 in march ... nerds , media types , tastemakers , people who use words like " tastemakers , " boys and girls in groups of three and four who carry instruments and occasionally know how to play them			1
they are all here for the @entity55 , a black hole of a conference that has absorbed every industry that involves liberal arts graduates with a creative streak			1
at the center of the chaos stands the @entity63 -- a grand dame of a hotel built in 1886 , but recently updated and restored			0
it 's a big , handsome place , certainly up to its job of sheltering dignitaries and celebrities who visit @entity0 ' capital city			1
the @entity72 building has a terrace that overlooks the street and a large rotunda that caps the activity of a bustling lobby bar and the comings and goings from two different restaurants			0
the @entity63 has been the backdrop for all sorts of @entity0 history -- from the @entity84 plotting their ambush of @entity86 to @entity87 taking in the returns of his presidential run , but its most famous visitors are ghosts			0
stories abound , but the most common is that of a little girl , allegedly the daughter of a senator , who died in the hotel chasing a ball			0
it 's said that occasionally you can still hear peals of childish laughter and the thump , thump of the toy she lost hold of			2
but stopping by the @entity63 each evening for a nightcap , the only ghosts i saw were those of children past who 've grown up to be tipsy and tarted up young adults raring to take on @entity1 's abundant nightlife			1
@entity116 : cheap thrills with an old flame the stream of revelers in the @entity122 's lobby is a byproduct of the hotel 's address on @entity126 , @entity1 's honky tonk strip and the basis of its claim to the title " @entity1			1
" at its best sixth is a people - watching paradise with a smorgasbord of music to choose from ; at its worst it can feel like @entity137 at a keg party			2
during march in @entity1 , there is live music and then some			1
like a gangster buying turkeys for his neighborhood on @entity145 , at @entity55 , big business throws concerts and gives away booze to the culture it co-opts and profits from			1
@entity1 is a natural place for artists and companies to play patty cake			1
it 's home to four @entity156 companies , including @entity157 -- one of the first companies to let profit motive wear a tie dye to work			2
and it 's home to a gold mine of musicians and artists , including one @entity165 , who despite playing outlaw country , flying his freak flag and professing a fondness for funny cigarettes has made a bundle in the mainstream			2
( the fact that he forgot to pay taxes on part of that bundle , only reinforces the point			0
) the bohemian ethos that exists in @entity1 has always accommodated commercial interests			1
even the oft - heard local phrase " @entity181 " is not an endorsement of the town 's many hippies and hipsters , but instead a slogan of the @entity187 to promote small businesses			2
after three days and 21 bands , i found myself in line at a @entity192 buying earplugs and iodine tablets for my girlfriend back home in @entity197			0
( note : you ca n't buy them in @entity1 and you do n't need them anyway			1
note to girlfriend : i tried			0
) a friend suggested we leave the chaos of the conference and go stand in front of trees for a while instead of stacks of amplifiers			0
so we hit the @entity210 , a seven - mile stretch of land where you can get lost within city limits			2
on previous trips i 'd cooled off in it 's various swimming holes , but this time we just strolled along the trails , scrambled around the dry creek bed and admired the limestone cliffs			2
this is the healthy side of @entity1			1
the part that pushes it to the top of " livable " city lists			0
and although it was a dry 80 degrees you could feel traces of the oppressive heat that will consume the city in a few months			0
@entity231 has its rain to thank for keeping the city from being completely overrun by transplants ; @entity1 has its summers			1
when the din in our ears finally stopped and we 'd sweated out the past few nights of excess , we decided to ease back into town via @entity242 -- a local dive bar where it 's @entity244 every day			0
from the looks of the lights , decorations and secondhand smoke , time stopped here sometime in the ' 70s			0
the bar is usually tended by @entity251 herself ( it 's rumored that the @entity244 decorations are permanently on display because she lost her husband during the holidays and left the bar just as it was when he passed ) , but that day it was her nephew who brought us our drinks			0
how delightfully decadent to sit in a cool dark bar on a hot sunny day			0
we left just as the sun began to set			0
if you go : @entity1 essentials			1

@entity1 's tremendous *temporary* bat population puts on a great evening show
@entity55 *festival* mixes the city 's bohemian and big business *sensibilities*
@entity1 has a *reputation* both for live music and natural *attractions*
