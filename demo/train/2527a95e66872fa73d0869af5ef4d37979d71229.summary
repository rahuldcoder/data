-- fifteen hundred elections and ballot initiatives will be decided @entity3 2013			2
although no congressional or presidential candidates are on the ballot , the results of the votes will have a significant impact on the everyday lives of millions of @entity10			0
with so much on the line , we @entity10 owe it to our families , friends , neighbors and communities to get out to the polls			1
today , september 24 , is @entity19 , which gives millions of @entity10 who are n't on the voter rolls a chance to easily register			1
on @entity3 , which falls on november 5 , the outcomes of many major political races will be determined , including the governorships of @entity26 and @entity27			1
once elected , these governors will work with their legislatures to draft their states ' budgets and determine how much road improvements , parks and school systems will be funded and whether state taxes will go up , down or stay the same			0
several mayoral elections will also be decided in november , including the race to lead @entity38 , @entity10 's largest metropolis			2
parents will be asked to determine the makeup of school boards , many of which face tough decisions because of budget cuts -- one of the toughest being whether to close schools			0
entire communities will need to determine the outcomes of ballot referendums that will amend state constitutions or establish or recall local laws that affect everyone in the community			2
it is important that all @entity10 help make those decisions			0
to that end , more than 800 organizations , including the @entity57 , are taking part in the largest one - day effort of the year to register voters and secure their participation in the @entity10 political system			1
identified as a national day for civic action , @entity19 brings together nonprofits , volunteers , celebrities and political leaders to engage potential voters on the ground through coordinated events nationwide			1
from bus and rail stops , to retail stores and malls , to concerts and fairs , thousands of voter registration events are planned			1
why create a day to bring national attention to voting ? because voting is the bedrock of our democracy and how every @entity10 takes ownership of the communities where we live , work and play			0
voting is also the easiest way to make your opinion known on any issue -- local , state or national -- that 's important to you and your family			0
to improve our schools , we must vote			0
to restore or build new parks that our kids can safely play in , entire communities must vote			1
to improve our transportation infrastructure , every @entity10 has to vote			0
in 2012 , more than 300,000 @entity10 registered to vote during the first @entity19			1
this year , we will continue to do for civic engagement what @entity104 does for global warming and environmental awareness			0
