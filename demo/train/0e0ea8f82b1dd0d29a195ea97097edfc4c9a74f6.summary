@entity0 , @entity1 -- a secret document that appears to show that @entity8 was working on building nuclear weapons as recently as 2007 is " alarming " and " part of a body of evidence backing up deep concerns over @entity8 's nuclear program , " a @entity4 diplomatic source with knowledge of the papers told @entity2 on monday			1
the @entity15 , the @entity17 nuclear watchdog , has a copy of the secret papers , which were also obtained by the @entity20 , the source said			1
@entity15 officials confirm they are investigating the document but said they have not formally asked @entity8 for more information about it			1
a top international nuclear expert said it seemed to point to @entity8 efforts to build a bomb			1
" the only realistic use of this is in a nuclear weapon , " said @entity28 , the president of the @entity29			0
" it shows that either @entity8 is developing the capability [ to build nuclear weapons ] or it is moving to implement a bomb program -- and either one is bad , " said @entity33 , who reviewed the document for the @entity20 before the newspaper published its report sunday			1
but @entity33 warned that the document is edited and has no date on it			0
the source who gave it to the @entity20 said it was from 2007 , but neither the @entity20 nor the @entity29 was able to date it definitively , @entity33 said			2
in @entity8 , @entity51 spokesman @entity50 said the @entity20 ' " claim that @entity8 is working on the final and important component of a nuclear bomb is false and not worth paying any attention to , " the semi-official @entity49 news agency reported			1
" this type of statement is made in the media to put political and psychological pressure [ on @entity8 ] by the officials of various countries , " @entity50 said , according to the @entity49 report			2
@entity64 intelligence concluded in 2007 that @entity8 had suspended work on its nuclear weapons program in 2003			1
in the @entity68 released in december 2007 , the @entity64 intelligence community dramatically reversed course from its 2005 evaluation			0
it expressed " high confidence " in 2005 that the @entity72 was working toward nuclear weapons , then two years later said -- also with " high confidence " -- that @entity8 had stopped its weapons program in 2003			1
@entity8 denies seeking to build nuclear weapons , saying its nuclear program is to produce civilian energy and medical research			1
but it is under intense pressure from the international community , with @entity84 and @entity85 saying last week they would push for stronger @entity17 sanctions on @entity88			2
@entity64 secretary of state @entity89 would n't comment on the secret document monday , but told reporters that concerns about @entity8 's nuclear program " have been heightened already " in recent months after revelations of a once - secret nuclear enrichment facility near the @entity8 city of @entity98 , and @entity8 's @entity99 authorizing the construction of at least 10 new nuclear production facilities			1
she said the @entity104 administration has taken a " dual - track " approach to @entity8 , including the offer of engagement and taking part in nuclear talks			2
" we 've been at the table			0
but i do n't think anyone can doubt that our outreach has produced very little in terms of any kind of positive response from the @entity8 , " @entity113 said , adding that the second approach -- the international pressure -- is key to pushing @entity8 officials to change " their actions and decisions concerning the nuclear program			1
" @entity126 , a former @entity8 diplomat , says the revelation about the document " means , essentially ... that the @entity8 have been lying to everybody " when they said they were not seeking to build nuclear weapons			2
@entity126 said it was no accident that this document appeared when it did			0
" the fact that the document comes out at this time makes it very difficult for @entity138 and @entity139 not to go along with more sanctions , " he said			0
it would also make it easier for " @entity142 to go ahead with a unilateral strike " on @entity8 's nuclear facilities , he added			1
" the agenda will change as a result of the publication of this document unless the document is proven to be false by the @entity8 authorities , " said @entity126 , who is now a senior research consultant at the @entity146			2
@entity126 -- who left @entity8 after the @entity153 in 1979 -- has not seen the original document but said the material published by the @entity20 " is what an authentic document would look like			1
" " it places pressure on the @entity8 government to try to use what time remains to get out of this situation , " he said			0
according to a report dated monday on the web site of @entity33 's group , a neutron initiator is a critical component of a nuclear weapon			0
the @entity29 report said the device " would most likely be placed at the center of a fission bomb made from weapon - grade uranium " and " works by the high explosives compressing the nuclear core and the initiator " to produce a " spurt of neutrons " as a result of fusion			0
" the neutrons flood the core of weapon - grade uranium and initiate the chain reaction , " the @entity29 report said			0
@entity33 said the document described efforts to " research and test a neutron initiator , " a nuclear component for which he could not see " any civil use			0
" " they appear to be doing the right things , " he said			0
" but you do n't know how it fits into a nuclear weapons program			2
" he also said the public had failed to understand a key part of the debate about @entity8 's nuclear program			1
" it 's not whether there is something or nothing , but whether there is a capabilities focus or an actual decision to build nuclear weapons , " he said			0
" it 's not like an on - off switch , it 's like a dimmer control			0
" @entity2 senior international correspondent @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
