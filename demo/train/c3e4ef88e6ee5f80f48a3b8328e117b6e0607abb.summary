are roughly four times more likely than their peers to become depressed or attempt suicide in later childhood , a new study suggests			1
researchers followed 125 children with @entity4 for up to 14 years beginning at ages 4 to 6 , and compared them with a similar group of children without adhd			1
thirty - nine percent of the children with @entity4 were also found to have depression during the study period , versus 8 percent in the control group			1
the risk for depression increased if the child demonstrated symptoms and behaviors that are distinct from -- but often occur alongside -- @entity4 , such as anxiety , defiance , hostility , bullying , and fighting			2
the risk for depression was also more pronounced if the child 's mother had a history of depression			0
@entity0 : how to recognize the symptoms of depression " the only children with @entity4 who were not at increased risk for depression were those without a depressed mother and who exhibited very few symptoms of other types of mental health problems , " says the senior author of the study , @entity36 , @entity37 , a psychologist and professor of epidemiology at the @entity40			1
" that is only a small proportion of children with @entity4			2
" @entity4 also increased the risk of suicide attempts			2
roughly 18 percent of the kids with @entity4 attempted suicide at least once during the study , compared with 6 percent of the kids in the control group			1
( none were successful , fortunately			0
) children who were primarily hyperactive and impulsive appeared to be at greatest risk , which suggests that impulsivity may play a role in suicidal behavior , the researchers say			0
girls were at greater risk than boys for both depression and suicide attempts , but there were n't enough girls in the study to draw firm conclusions about gender , according to the authors			2
@entity0 : how to spot the warning signs of suicide the study appears in the @entity81			0
@entity4 is estimated to affect 4.4 million children in the @entity83 and has been shown to raise the risk for academic and social difficulties , employment problems , and even brushes with the law later in life			0
however , this study is the first to examine the risk factors for depression in very young children with @entity4 , and the first to follow children for an extended period of time			1
experts have long suspected an adhd - depression link in childhood , but the research to date has been inconclusive			0
" this study adds more data to the notion that early manifestations of hyperactivity and impulsivity ... are not necessarily benign , " says dr. @entity100 , @entity101 , chief of the research branch dedicated to child and adolescent treatment and prevention at the @entity106 , which funded the study			0
@entity0 : quiz : do you have adult adhd ? but the children in the study are n't necessarily typical of all children with @entity4 , says @entity119 , @entity37 , a professor of psychology at the @entity121 , in @entity122			1
it 's relatively uncommon for @entity4 to be identified in children as young as 4 , he explains , and kids who get a diagnosis at that age tend to have more severe symptoms			1
" these kids were diagnosed earlier , which means that the researchers have a sample with especially higher severity , " @entity119 says			0
" they may be getting the high end of the spectrum			0
" parents should not " panic and think their children with @entity4 are destined for depression or suicide , " @entity36 says			1
however , he adds , if parents are concerned that their child is showing symptoms of adhd or depression , they should consult a mental health professional and consider family therapy			0
@entity0 : what if my child begins to exhibit symptoms of @entity4 ? more research is needed to identify effective interventions that can lower the chances of depression in high - risk kids with @entity4 , @entity100 says , echoing @entity36 and his colleagues			1
early intervention and treatment are important , as the risk of depression and other health problems associated with @entity4 can last well into adulthood			2
previous studies have estimated that anywhere from 16 percent to 37 percent of adults with @entity4 have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder or dysthymia , a milder form of depression			2
and in another new study , which appears in the @entity175 , researchers at @entity173 report that teenagers with @entity4 are about twice as likely to have problems with alcohol and drugs in their 30s than those without the disorder			1
@entity0 : adult adhd and substance use however , the risk seems mainly due to the overlap between adhd and conduct disorder , a related condition that 's characterized by physical aggression and delinquent behavior , such as stealing and vandalism			0
the teens who did not show signs of conduct disorder did not appear to be at increased risk for substance abuse , the study found			0
both adhd and conduct disorder may be an early warning sign for alcohol and drug problems , the researchers suggest			1
