the washing of feet was a radical act in @entity4 ' time			1
it is no less radical in the modern era , with pope @entity8 ' decision to break with the long - standing papal tradition of washing only priests ' feet , to include women and @entity13 in the symbolic ceremony			1
the controversy began on holy thursday last year when @entity8 washed the feet of two women and two muslims at a juvenile detention center in @entity20			1
before this , modern @entity21 had only ever washed the feet of 12 priests at the @entity24 , during the @entity25			2
watch : pope @entity8 washes prisoners ' feet this year , @entity8 visited a home for the elderly and disabled , the @entity30 , to wash the feet of " 12 disabled people of different ages , ethnicities and religious confessions , " during a special @entity36 , according to the @entity24			1
those chosen for the special honor included a 16 - year - old boy from @entity40 who was paralyzed in a diving accident last year , a 19 - year - old man and a 39 - year - old woman diagnosed with cerebral palsy , and two 86 - year - olds with mobility problems			0
the 78 - year - old pope smiled at each of the people whose feet he washed , but clearly struggled to get up from his knees as he moved down the line ; two assistants helped him to his feet			1
he appeared to tire towards the end of the short ceremony			0
the tradition of the pontiff washing his priests ' feet is based on a passage of the @entity61 which says that @entity4 attended to his disciples at the @entity63 , saying , " if i , your lord and teacher , have washed your feet , you also ought to wash one another 's feet			1
" ( @entity70 13:15 ) @entity24 ecclesiastical rules say that only " adult males " may have their feet washed at the @entity73 ( according to the @entity74 , 2002 ) , following the biblical tradition that @entity4 washed the feet of 12 men			1
the choice of 12 priests is also symbolic of @entity4 ' institution of the priesthood , which according to @entity84 tradition , occurred at the @entity63			1
for many years , however , bishops around the world received permission from the @entity24 to wash the feet of women as well in their churches			0
in fact , when the now - @entity8 was archbishop of @entity92 , @entity93 , he washed the feet of young mothers at a maternity hospital in 2005			2
and it was n't the first -- or last -- time his choice would provoke debate : in 2001 , he washed and kissed the feet of 12 @entity103 patients at a hospice in the @entity93 capital , and in 2008 , he washed the feet of recovering drug addicts at a rehab center in the city			2
but until last year , no pope had dared to go against @entity24 rules and choose anyone but priests for the @entity115 event			2
in choosing to change the practice , @entity8 is being as radical as @entity4 was in his own time			2
" according to the @entity123 , the washing of feet was forbidden to any jew except those in slavery , " the @entity118 of @entity119 says in its holy thursday @entity120			0
" @entity4 ' action of washing the feet of his disciples was unusual for his gesture went beyond the required laws of hospitality ( washing of hands ) to what was , in appearance , a menial task			0
" by eschewing traditional practice , @entity8 is emphasizing the spirit rather than the letter of the law -- something @entity4 himself did by breaking with @entity144 tradition in washing his disciples ' feet			1
and the spirit , or meaning , behind washing the feet of another person is one of humility and service -- that through the act , the leader becomes a servant to his followers			0
the @entity24 's @entity157 says that foot - washing " represents the service and charity of @entity160 , who came ' not to be served , but to serve			0
' " according to @entity24 spokesman father @entity164 , @entity8 ' gesture in 2013 was one of humility and service , intended to " embrace those on the fringes of society			0
" from the beginning of his papacy , the pope himself has been on the " fringes " of long - standing @entity24 protocol , for example by choosing to live outside of the papal palace and eschewing traditional papal garments and modes of transport			0
in breaking the rules of foot - washing at the @entity24 , the @entity8 is acknowledging what has been a practice in local churches for some time , and also reminding @entity186 that the important thing is not whose foot is being washed , but the spirit behind that gesture .			0
