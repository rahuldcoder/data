@entity0 -- the 2012 presidential election shattered spending records , further polarized a divided country and launched a thousand hashtags			0
the race appeared to be a nail - biter going into tuesday night but in the end , it came down to the state that most had been saying for weeks that it would â € ” @entity10			2
here are five things we learned from tuesday victorious @entity14 faces familiar challenges 1			2
the @entity16 has a @entity18 problem " if we do n't do better with @entity18 , we 'll be out of the @entity24 forever , " says @entity16 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity19 , who was the national @entity18 co-chair of sen. @entity22 's 2008 presidential campaign			2
" the big issue @entity16 are going to have to wrestle with is the @entity18 issue , " adds @entity16 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity27 , who served as president @entity29 's first press secretary			2
" republicans are going to have to find a different way forward			0
" the national exit polls tell the story			0
@entity36 are the fastest growing - segment of the population			1
their share of the vote expanded from 9 % in 2008 to 10 % in this election			0
the president won 67 % of the vote four years ago			2
he increased that to 71 % this year			0
latinos were crucial in helping @entity14 win the battleground states of @entity47 and @entity48 , and in putting the president in the lead for @entity52 's 29 electoral votes			1
and they were just as important in turning the former swing state of @entity54 into what appears to be an increasingly safe state for the @entity57			0
@entity58 : 2012 exit polls if the current trend continues , @entity60 and @entity61 could turn from red to purple			0
the 2012 election is a loud wake - up call for the @entity16 to change its stance on illegal immigration			0
and that 's being acknowledged by arguably the best known @entity18 @entity16 senator			0
" the conservative movement should have particular appeal to people in minority and immigrant communities who are trying to make it , and @entity16 need to work harder than ever to communicate our beliefs to them , " said sen. @entity71 of @entity52 in a statement tuesday night			0
opinion : five things @entity14 must do 2			2
the youth vote came up big â € ” and the white vote got smaller a big question heading into @entity87 was whether younger voters would show up at the polls			1
more of them did than last time			0
according to national exit polls , 18 - 29 year olds increased from 17 % to 18 % of the electorate from 2004 to 2008			0
they made up 19 % of the electorate this time around			0
that jump in size from four years ago made up for the president 's drop in capturing the youth vote , from 66 % in 2008 to 60 % in 2012			1
it was n't just age , but also race , that worked in the president 's favor			1
@entity14 's share of the white vote dropped from 43 % four years ago to 39 % this year			1
but that was negated by the shrinking of the white vote from 74 % of the electorate four years ago to 72 % now			1
and the @entity114 - @entity113 percentage of the electorate stayed steady at 13 %			0
some @entity16 strategists said that the white vote needed to be 74 % for @entity117 to win			1
" the youth vote and the black vote turned out once again and that 's to the president 's credit , " @entity27 said			1
world worries as @entity113 fiscal cliff looms 3			0
the auto bailouts helped drive @entity14 to victory in @entity10 for months , the @entity14 campaign touted the taxpayer bailouts of @entity129 and @entity130 , and they were given prominent prime - time placement during the @entity132 in early september			1
it 's a strategy that the @entity14 campaign thought could be the difference in @entity10 , a major base for the auto industry that eventually decided the election			1
" the @entity113 auto industry is back on top , " @entity14 said campaigning last week in the @entity10			1
the bailouts were started under president @entity29 in 2008 but @entity14 grabbed the keys to the program the next year , managing and funding the assistance			1
@entity117 opposed the bailout and pushed for a privately financed and managed bankruptcy of the two automakers			1
the @entity14 campaign and other democrats have attacked @entity117 over his opposition to the federal intervention , which aided the companies through their eventual bankruptcies			1
and in the final weeks leading up the the election , the @entity14 campaign highlighted pushback by @entity129 and @entity130 to a @entity117 tv ad and a radio spot this past week that claimed both domestic auto makers were sending @entity113 jobs to @entity161			1
@entity162 stands by @entity117 auto ads it seemed to work			2
nearly six in 10 @entity10 voters said they approved of the federal government 's role in helping the troubled domestic automakers , and according to exit polls , the president won three quarters of those voters			1
economy tops voter concerns in exit polls 4			0
@entity117 was n't able to expand the map much was made of campaign visits by @entity117 and his running mate , rep. @entity178 , to @entity179 in the final weekend before the election , and @entity117 's return to the @entity179 on @entity87			1
the @entity117 campaign and allied super pacs supporting the @entity16 nominee flooded @entity179 airwaves in the final weeks with a flurry of tv ads. to a lesser degree , there was a similar push in @entity191 , another solidly @entity132 state where public opinion polls tightened last month			1
there was talk by @entity117 campaign officials of being on offense and of expanding the electoral map			2
it did n't pan out			0
while @entity117 performed stronger than 2008 @entity16 nominee @entity22 in @entity179 and @entity191 , it was n't enough			1
and of the swing states that swung blue four years ago , it appears @entity117 was only able to turn @entity203 and @entity204 red again			2
@entity117 's ' all ' proved not enough 5			2
what will $ 6 billion get you ? we had a @entity132 president , a @entity16 @entity209 , and @entity132 @entity210 going into the 2012 election			0
and we 'll have a @entity212 in the @entity24 , with a @entity16 @entity24 and a @entity132 @entity210 after the election			0
when all the bills are in , total spending for the 2012 election ( all federal and state races ) could top a record - breaking $ 6 billion			0
and what did all that money buy ? 2012 election priciest to date : $ 4.2 billion tab and rising some would argue ... nothing .			0

the president increased his support with @entity36 , the fastest growing segment of the population
changes in the size of the youth vote and the white vote worked in @entity14 's favor
the auto bailout helped @entity14 in @entity10 , a crucial battleground
@entity117 failed to expand the map and lost in @entity179 and @entity191
