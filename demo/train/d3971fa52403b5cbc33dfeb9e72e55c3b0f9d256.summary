@entity0 , @entity1 -- when exactly did the donkey become an endangered species ? democrats had big victories in recent years , taking back control of both houses of @entity9 in 2006 and the @entity10 in 2008			1
and , in response to those defeats , @entity11 seemed to be wandering in the wilderness			2
unsure of whom to be , @entity11 strategists have been wasting time locked in a completely unconstructive debate over whether to do more outreach or get back to the basics of conservatism			2
( it 's not as if you ca n't do both those things			2
) today , republicans are still lost in the woods			0
but suddenly , things look even bleaker for @entity5 , who seem as if they 're headed off in a dozen different directions			1
polls show a detectable amount of angst among many @entity33 over the cost of health care reform , government bailouts and other massive expenditures			2
there is a sense in many parts of the country that president @entity42 and @entity9 @entity5 are trying to do too much too fast and running up too high a bill in the process			1
worse , there is growing anxiety that -- in trying to do so much at once -- the administration and @entity5 in @entity9 have taken their eyes off more important matters			1
like keeping the country safe			0
the recent terror scare orchestrated by @entity52 , the 23 - year - old @entity53 suspected suicide bomber who allegedly intended to blow up a @entity33 airliner on christmas day , has only heightened those concerns			1
and frankly , @entity42 's comments thursday about the incident and the changes that his administration is preparing to make to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again wo n't do much to reassure the country			1
the remarks were underwhelming and predictable			0
while @entity42 was right to take responsibility and insist that the buck stops with him , he should have explained exactly why the dots were n't connected by the intelligence community and been more willing to assign blame			1
that might have convinced more @entity33 that @entity42 and everyone who works for him understand that , in this deadly game of counterterrorism , you have to catch every possible threat			1
we got lucky this time			0
@entity33 need to see that their leaders understand this simple fact			2
maybe the congressional hearings into the incident will accomplish that			0
the @entity11 may not be in the best shape , and it can still be its own worst enemy			2
and yet , @entity11 look pretty good compared to @entity5 , whose moves have been even more questionable			1
it 's no wonder that some @entity5 lawmakers are bailing out			2
two longtime @entity5 senators have announced their retirements and according to polls , a handful of others are trailing against @entity11 opponents this week , @entity5 sens. @entity95 of @entity96 and @entity97 of @entity98 dropped out of re-election bids			1
both are longtime senators with powerful committee chairmanships , so why would @entity95 and @entity97 throw in the towel ? and why would recent polls show the @entity5 candidate for the @entity105 running behind the @entity11 in at least seven states -- @entity96 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity98 and @entity111 ? and why would some prominent @entity11 be newly energized to run for top offices -- such as former rep. @entity113 challenging @entity5 incumbent gov. @entity114 in @entity108			1
the liberal media is helpfully putting forth its own explanations for the @entity5 ' doldrums			0
@entity95 and @entity97 were facing tough re-election battles , we are told			0
@entity95 had been struggling with personal challenges , including his bout with prostate cancer and the death of his best friend in the @entity105 , @entity125 , who died last year			0
according to the @entity128 , the economic climate might have been a factor and @entity95 could be another casualty of the recession			0
that 's a rather benign explanation -- and an unsatisfying one			0
it 's closer to the truth to suggest that a key factor in all this -- the @entity95 and @entity97 retirements , the growing unpopularity of @entity5 @entity105 candidates , the new energy among @entity11 -- is the health care debate			1
it is true that @entity5 are polling badly in states where @entity9 ' health care reform remedies are unpopular			1
but even that does n't tell the whole story			0
for that , you need to look at a @entity150 poll from last month that found that @entity11 had closed the popularity gap with @entity5			1
in that survey , 40 percent of those questioned say the @entity33 would be better off if @entity5 ran @entity9 while 39 percent feel things would be better if @entity11 ran @entity9			1
the one - point margin was a statistical tie			0
just a few months earlier , in august , @entity5 had enjoyed a 10 - point advantage over @entity11			1
in january , about the time that president @entity42 took office , @entity5 had a 25 - point advantage			1
for now , the @entity33 people seem to be saying , loud and clear : slow down			0
think about what you 're doing			0
do n't simply borrow and print money			0
and , above all , choose your priorities carefully			0
do n't forget what 's really important			0
that message will get through , sooner or later -- even if , when it does , not all of today 's members of @entity9 are around to hear it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174			0

two @entity5 senators dropped their bids for re-election this week
@entity174 says suddenly the @entity5 look more lost than the @entity11
he says the nation is worried that @entity10 , @entity9 are trying to do too much
@entity42 's statement on terror plot did n't do enough to reassure @entity33 , he says
