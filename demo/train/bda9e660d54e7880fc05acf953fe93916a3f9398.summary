@entity0 , @entity1 -- the image remains chilling nearly eight years later : a pizza deliveryman sitting cross-legged on the pavement with a homemade bomb clamped around his neck , surrounded by nervous police who crouch behind their cars			1
" why is n't anybody trying to get this thing off me ? " he shouts to the dozens of officers nearby			2
but before a bomb squad can arrive , the device goes off , killing 46 - year - old @entity19			1
in the agonizing minutes before his death on august 28 , 2003 , @entity19 told police the bomb had been fastened to his body by people who ordered him to rob a bank and follow a detailed checklist before it would be disarmed -- instructions that amounted to a twisted scavenger hunt			1
timeline , evidence photos , video , 911 audio the case fueled years of debate about whether the hapless @entity19 had been the victim of a heinous murder or a willing participant in a horrifically botched crime			1
the @entity38 later concluded that @entity19 had been a participant and closed the books on the case in march			1
two people that agents identified as having been part of the scheme are in prison ; a third has died			1
but @entity19 ' family still believes he was a blameless victim -- " innocent 100 percent , " his sister , @entity47 , told @entity2			2
" they screwed up big time , " @entity47 said			2
" they let an innocent man , my brother , die while in their custody and they did n't even lift a finger to help him			2
" this case is going to be looked at for years to come , and they do n't want it known that they screwed up , " she said			2
" @entity19 never would have done this			0
" in particular , she said , one of the plotters escaped justice			0
according to the @entity38 , @entity65 knew of the robbery , but received immunity from prosecution and was allowed to go free			1
prosecutors never called him as a witness in the trials , saying he was ill at the time			0
the @entity38 believes a @entity75 associate , @entity74 , was the mastermind of the heist and likely made the bomb , the affidavit says			1
bombmaking materials were found in @entity74 's home			0
according to the @entity38 affidavit , one of the admitted conspirators said @entity65 carried the bomb out of @entity74 's garage on the day of the robbery and handed it to @entity74			1
read the entire @entity38 affidavit warrant @entity74 then secured the bomb around @entity19 ' neck and followed him to the @entity88 branch that @entity19 robbed shortly before his death , the affidavit states , quoting a witness who talked to @entity74 's girlfriend , @entity92			1
@entity75 is a registered sex offender who was a fugitive from a rape charge in @entity95 at the time the plot unfolded and was staying with @entity74 at the time , according to court papers			0
according to @entity99 , a convicted crack dealer who is now serving a 20 - year prison term in the bomb plot , @entity75 was to have divvied up the money from the bank heist			1
@entity75 has rebuffed repeated requests for comment from @entity2 , both by telephone and in person			0
@entity99 also gave the @entity38 information that implicated @entity19			1
according to an @entity38 agent 's court affidavit , @entity99 told authorities that @entity19 had been discussing the hold up about a month before it took place			1
@entity99 ' story had been corroborated by another witness in the affidavit			0
by all accounts , the 2003 case evolved into one of the most complicated and bizarre crimes in the annals of the @entity38			1
police investigating fake collar bomb extortion plot half an hour before the bomb went off , @entity19 had walked into the @entity88 branch on @entity126 in @entity0			1
the bomb sat on his chest beneath a white t - shirt , which had the word " @entity130 " spray - painted on it			1
and he carried a cane , which turned out to be a homemade shotgun			0
@entity19 handed over a series of notes to the tellers , demanding $ 250,000			0
tellers did n't have nearly that much in cash , and @entity19 walked out with a little less than $ 9,000			0
police caught up with him in the parking lot of a nearby eyeglass shop , where he died begging for help			0
because it was a bank robbery , the @entity38 became the lead investigative agency			1
agents quickly assembled a task force of more than 50 law enforcement officers from a half - dozen federal , state and local agencies			2
at first , the @entity38 saw @entity19 as a victim			1
@entity150 , a writer for @entity151 , has reported extensively on the case and told @entity2 that the notes @entity19 carried led him to believe he could live			2
" the note suggested at the very end of this , if he completed it in the allotted time -- which was n't much -- that he would be able to save his life , " @entity150 said			0
one federal law enforcement official says the cast of characters ultimately linked to the crime is " like a band of criminal misfits			0
" according to the @entity38 , those misfits began to turn on each other less than a month after @entity19 died			1
on september 21 , @entity74 called @entity167 to report that there was a body in his freezer -- the body of a man named @entity172 , whom he said was killed because he was going to report the bomb plot to authorities , according to the @entity38 affidavit			1
@entity74 told @entity38 agents that @entity172 had been killed by @entity92 and that he had helped @entity92 hide the body			1
after her arrest , @entity92 implicated @entity74 in the bomb plot , and she eventually told investigators she gunned down @entity172 when he threatened to go to police about the plan			2
@entity74 died of cancer before being officially linked to the crime			0
@entity92 is now serving prison terms both for the botched heist and for @entity172 's killing			0
her own lawyer says she has multiple personality disorders and sometimes has " difficulty " telling the truth			0
' pizza bomber ' conspirator gets life behind bars @entity99 , meanwhile , saw his 45 - year sentence for the bomb plot reduced to 20 years because he cooperated with authorities			1
and @entity75 now lives in @entity198 , @entity95 , north of @entity199			0
he 's the one @entity19 ' sister wants brought to justice			0
" he did n't deserve immunity , " @entity47 said			0
" he 's the guilty one that killed my brother			0
he deserved to be brought to justice			0
" prosecutors said @entity19 may have been duped into thinking the bomb was a fake before agreeing to take part in the holdup -- but they 're confident he was part of the plot from the beginning			2
" no one could have sat through this trial without understanding the degree of evidence linking mr. @entity19 to these participants , " assistant u.s. attorney @entity214 , who led the government 's case , told reporters			2
and @entity223 , a retired @entity38 agent and writer , told @entity2 that he believes @entity19 was murdered as part of the plot			1
" it was a first - degree murder , " @entity223 said			2
" this was an intentional , pre-meditated homicide			0
moreover , it was extremely cruel in the way the crime was executed			0
" @entity2 's @entity230 and @entity231 contributed to this report .			0
