@entity0 -- as @entity6 investigators work to identify the @entity8 militant who beheaded @entity10 journalist @entity9 , the tiniest details in the videotape of the killing could provide the key clue			1
although the killer is swathed head to toe in black , with only his eyes visible through a narrow strip , some distinguishing features can be picked out			2
his skin tone can be discerned from his hands , which are not covered , and he appears to be left - handed			2
the man 's height and build can also be established from the footage , as well as the kind of movements he makes			1
but the biggest clue may lie in his voice , which experts say has a distinctly @entity31 accent			1
linguists said that based on his voice , the man appears to be young , most likely under 30			1
he also appears to have been educated in @entity34 from a young age and to be from southern @entity34 or @entity0			1
@entity6 police and intelligence services have been tight - lipped about any progress in identifying the man			1
as they seek to trace him , they will doubtless be looking at those with known connections to jihadist movements or who have been to @entity47 to fight			2
however , they will also probably be seeking to match his voice with recordings they hold in an audio bank , said @entity54 , a forensic voice and speech analyst who also acts as an expert witness in @entity6 courts			1
@entity6 and most other countries hold such recordings , some made covertly , of people they suspect of involvement in terrorist activity , she said			1
" it 's likely that they will screen the voices , the voice data bank that they have , possibly using automatic speaker recognition software , and try to find the closest match to the voice in the video , " she said			1
no unique ' voice print ' that would probably narrow the possible matches to perhaps 200 or 300 , depending on the sort of data bank the intelligence services have , @entity54 said			1
but , she cautioned , despite what is sometimes seen in tv detective shows , the audio should not be seen as some kind of magic bullet			2
" there 's no such thing as a ' voice print ' that 's going to have a unique reference to one individual , and therefore they can match it , " she said			1
" speech is a kind of behavior ; it 's not a digital printout			2
" the next step will be for an expert phonetician and linguist to carry out a mixture of phonetic and acoustic analysis , she said			0
any conclusions would be based on the expert 's knowledge and experience , supported by acoustic measurements			0
they would focus on elements including pitch , intonation , intensity and patterns in the bands of acoustic energy , known as formants , measured using special software			1
@entity54 added , " from the voice in the video , there 's not a lot you can do until you have something to compare it to , and that 's in the hands of the intelligence services			1
" they might be working across international borders with intelligence agencies in @entity128 and the @entity129 to do so , she said			1
accent ' not purely @entity6 ' although the experts who spoke to @entity1 agree that the man is most likely from southern @entity34 or @entity0 , they differ on some points , indicating the difficulty of the task faced by intelligence services			1
@entity138 , a voice recognition expert , said he believed the voice was of someone who had spent most , if not all , of his life in @entity6			1
" however , there are other elements in the accent which are not purely @entity6			0
" something in the intonation and pronunciation , @entity138 said , suggests that the man may have some @entity150 origin or perhaps second - generation @entity150 parentage			1
" alternatively , it 's possible he 's picked up these influences from people around him , people he 's mixed with , " he said			0
there 's no sign , however , of any influence on his language from the @entity167 subcontinent , for example the @entity158 communities in @entity159 and @entity160 , he said			0
@entity54 tentatively suggested the accent may belong to someone who also speaks @entity170 or @entity171 , used in @entity172 and @entity173			0
' @entity31 ' another expert , @entity174 , a linguistics expert at the @entity175 , said the accent sounded @entity31 but was one that could be described as " @entity31			0
" he 's probably , although not definitely , a @entity178 , he said , and " he 's grown up in a multicultural , multilingual neighborhood with lots of different languages around , and this kind of environment leads to some kind of change in the way @entity31 is pronounced			1
" it 's very hard to tell exactly what part of @entity0 he might be from , he said , because this kind of @entity31 emerges wherever in @entity0 you get a high concentration of people speaking different languages , reflecting the various immigrant groups that have come into the country since @entity196 @entity174 said it was difficult to tell the ethnicity of a young person who has grown up learning @entity31 from other people who learned it as a second language or whose parents are second - language speakers , because in this melting pot everyone starts to sound quite similar , even those whose parents are native speakers			1
" it 's quite hard to tell the ethnicity of this person from his voice alone , " he said			1
" he 's probably not @entity6 white			0
he could be of @entity159 origin ; he could be of @entity213 origin ; he could be @entity10 origin or something			0
it 's very , very hard to pinpoint , " he said			0
" some commentators may say it 's not a @entity6 @entity31 accent			0
well , it is a @entity6 @entity31 accent ; it 's one that 's grown up in this multilingual environment			2
" @entity174 thinks the man may have arrived in @entity6 as a child and begun to acquire the language then			2
however , he does n't exclude that he may be @entity6 - born			0
words , phrasing give clues besides the militant 's voice , other pointers lie in the language used in the message			2
@entity138 points out that the audio sample is small , making it hard to draw definite conclusions from it			0
nonetheless , he believes that while the militant is a native @entity6 speaker , parts of the text he reads out in the video were written by someone who -- while very proficient in @entity31 -- was not			0
" some of the phrasing is not pure native speaker , so he 's been assisted with this text			0
it 's not entirely him , " he said , pointing to examples of non-idiomatic expressions and overly stilted , formal @entity31			0
he also believes that the fighter is educated to at least high school graduation , if not university , level and probably comes from a professional , middle - class background			0
@entity54 too believes that the voice belongs to an educated speaker			2
@entity174 , however , suggests that the man 's accent points to him man coming from an inner city demographic , where the socioeconomic class and education level are often lower			2
the text appears to be written in standard @entity31 , he said , so there are no clues to be found in the slang a young man might otherwise have used			2
intriguingly , @entity138 speculates that the way the militant refers to " the @entity158 " in the video may suggest he could be a convert to @entity271			0
" i do n't think there 's a strong @entity158 background there , necessarily , " he said			0
" he does talk about ' us ' at one point , but he also talks about ' the @entity158 , ' and so there 's a little bit of distance there between him and that group , and i 'm thinking that that may well be due to his adoption of the religion , so i 'm thinking it 's possible he is not originally from a @entity158 family			0
" @entity1 's @entity287 and @entity288 contributed to this report .			0

linguists say the man is probably from southern @entity34 or @entity0
intelligence services may be comparing voice to recordings of suspects
he may have been influenced by a multicultural environment
experts can use software to match pitch , intonation , intensity to another voice
