-- [ updated 3:45 p.m. monday , october 29 ] an aluminum sculpture called " @entity2 " bows to people wednesday in @entity4 , @entity5			1
the naked blue man is nearly 20 feet tall and weighs three tons			2
it was donated by @entity9 artist @entity8 , who has already built one " @entity2 " in his home country			2
@entity8 's goal is to put up 1,000 of them across the globe as a way to link other cultures and people			2
" the greeting is the first step in any relationship , " @entity8 said wednesday in @entity4			2
" it 's the principle of all communication			0
" @entity5 was chosen by @entity8 because it is diametrically opposite of @entity9 on the world map			0
he hopes the project will help @entity5 get to know more about his country and the traditional @entity9 way of greeting			0
" @entity2 " is blue , @entity8 says , because blue is a neutral color that could n't be perceived as symbolizing a specific skin color			0
and it is naked to reflect all men -- clothing might have symbolized someone 's social standing or status			1
@entity8 raised money for the @entity5 sculpture by selling 800 much smaller " @entity2 " statues for $ 200 each , according to the @entity5 newspaper @entity39			0
