-- the husband of a pregnant @entity3 woman -- who he says has been brain dead for seven weeks -- asked a court tuesday to force a hospital to take her off a respirator , ventilator and other machines , saying her wishes should n't be disregarded just because she is pregnant			1
@entity12 filed an emergency motion as well as a complaint against @entity15 , both with the same goal : to have the hospital disconnect the machines so that her family can take her body and give her a proper burial			1
" @entity24 is legally dead , and to further conduct surgical procedures on a deceased body is nothing short of outrageous , " her husband contends in the motion			2
notably , officials at the @entity30 , @entity3 , hospital where 33 - year - old @entity24 is have not publicly declared her dead ( though they have not disputed her husband 's assertions either )			1
@entity12 -- like his wife , a paramedic by training -- said the doctors told him @entity39 " had lost all activity in her brain stem , " and an accompanying chart stated she was " brain dead , " according to his lawsuit			1
the hospital referred requests for comment to the @entity49 district attorney 's office , which said it will defend the medical facility against the lawsuit			2
it is legal counsel for @entity15 " in a number of civil areas			0
" noting it first learned of the legal action just before noon tuesday , the office said it " will file a response in due course " but wo n't have any further comment now " because litigation is pending			0
" the case will be heard by @entity49 17th district court judge @entity63			1
at this time , no hearing has been scheduled			0
hospital spokesman @entity65 said last month that doctors were simply trying to obey a @entity3 law that states that " you can not withhold or withdraw life - sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient			1
" and last week , @entity65 told @entity0 that the hospital believed " the courts are the appropriate venue to provide clarity , direction and resolution in this matter			1
" @entity24 's husband responds by saying that " @entity79 can not possibly be a pregnant patient -- @entity79 is dead			1
" furthermore , he argued that her wishes -- relayed , he said , in conversations but not in writing that she not be on " life - sustaining " measures when she is brain dead -- should n't be treated differently than a man or other woman simply because of her pregnancy			1
mom of pregnant woman on life support : change the law " @entity79 has a fundamental right to make medical decisions regarding her own body , " her husband contended in the motion			2
" ... to take those rights away from @entity79 , and force her to be subject to various medical procedures simply because she is pregnant , is a gross violation of her constitutional right			0
" last month , @entity12 discussed with @entity0 affiliate @entity106 his wife 's wishes and how their shared occupation had helped shape her views			2
" we 'd seen things out in the field			0
we both knew that we did n't want to be on life support , " he said			0
" we reached a point where you wish your wife 's body would just stop			0
" @entity119 , @entity24 's mother , said tuesday the family is not talking about the case but said she and her husband , @entity122 , agree with @entity12 that their daughter would want to be removed from the machines			1
as the lawsuit details , the story began at 2 a.m. on november 26 , when @entity12 found his wife unconscious on the kitchen floor			2
at the time , she was 14 weeks ' pregnant with the couple 's second child			1
soon after that , she was taken to @entity15 , where @entity12 claims he was told his wife " was for all purposes brain dead			1
" the family also says the fetus may have been deprived of oxygen			0
in the lawsuit , he claims subsequent measures taken at the hospital -- and , in turn , the state law used to justify them -- amount " to nothing more than the cruel and obscene mutilation of a deceased body against the expressed will of the deceased and her family			1
" " @entity24 's death is a horrible and tragic circumstance , but by no means should ( the hospital ) be entitled to continue cutting into her deceased body in front of her husband and family under the guise of ' life - sustaining ' treatment , " according to the lawsuit			1
dr. @entity160 , director of obstetrical clinical research and quality assurance at @entity163 , works on complicated pregnancies and prenatal diagnosis			0
he says nothing scientifically in @entity24 ' pregnancy is black and white			2
" a lot depends , first of all , on how long the patient here was deprived of oxygen , or otherwise compromised			0
we can certainly use tools like ultrasound and @entity175 to sometimes see where there has been injury as a result of low blood pressure or low oxygen			0
but just seeing that things look well is n't the same as saying that things will be well , " @entity160 told @entity0			0
" those things ca n't perfectly predict health and outcome			0
and there are certainly occasions where as we look as best as we can tell , a fetus seems to be developing appropriately and meeting all its milestones , and yet after after birth , after delivery , there is evidence of profound compromise , " @entity160 said			0
@entity198 , a @entity199 law professor who helped write the applicable @entity3 law , said he believes the hospital is misinterpreting it			2
" she 's not a patient anymore , " @entity198 said			0
" and so i do n't see how we can use a provision of the law that talks about treating or not treating a patient in a case where we really do n't have a patient			2
" the @entity3 law states that a " person may not withdraw or withhold life - sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient			1
" @entity198 said , " the provision they seem to be relying on is called the pregnancy exclusion			0
more than 30 states have this pregnancy exclusion in their law			0
... if they 're relying on that provision , i think @entity3 law in that respect does not compel the provision of life - sustaining treatment			1
" @entity198 believes the lawsuit is a straightforward argument because the law was not written as a vehicle for making " treatment decisions " for patients who are dead and therefore beyond treatment			2
" if she 's brain - dead , then she 's already dead , so letting her die is n't really the concept			1
but can he say , ' take her off the ventilator ' ? i believe he can			0
" but @entity241 , a @entity0 legal analyst , said that she thinks the state statute as written is " ambiguous " and " vague			1
" " when you have these murky areas , you have to go to court , because courts provide clarity , courts provide direction , " @entity241 said			1
" and that 's why i think the lawsuit is the right thing ... to jump to the conclusion			0
" when ' life support ' is really ' death support ' @entity0 's @entity256 and @entity257 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity49 judge will hear the case , but no date has been set for hearing
@entity24 was 14 weeks ' pregnant when stricken ; hospital has said it must follow state law
analyst : courts can " provide clarity " on a " vague " state statute
family : @entity12 is brain - dead with no life to sustain ; calls treatment " cruel and obscene mutilation "
