-- @entity1 believed in three things : teaching , @entity4 and @entity5			1
the 33 - year - old educator from @entity7 , @entity8 , was gunned down thursday as he went on a morning jog outside his home in the @entity4 city of @entity12			1
no one has claimed responsibility for the slaying			2
@entity4 authorities have pledged to investigate the killing , the latest in a series of assassinations in some @entity4 cities			1
there have been near - daily targeted killings in @entity12 and @entity23 , with the victims mainly security forces , activists and members of the judiciary			1
@entity1 's death is a reminder of how dangerous eastern @entity4 has become , awash in weapons and armed groups since the 2011 ouster and street - mob killing of dictator @entity35			1
@entity1 moved to @entity4 a year and a half ago and took a job with the @entity12 , a new school on the outskirts of @entity12 where @entity39 was taught , according to its site			1
hundreds of comments praising the teacher flooded the school 's @entity45 page within hours of his murder			2
" you did n't have to know him to know what he was about -- which was respect , optimism , cooperation , team work , " posted @entity48			2
" he believed in his students , and that 's the greatest gift any teacher can grant a child			2
" some grieved for his wife , @entity61 , and their young son who @entity1 often wrote about on his @entity65 account			1
the teacher recently tweeted : " it 's official			0
" according to members of @entity1 's church back home in @entity7 where he served as a deacon , the teacher chose to stay in @entity4 while his wife and son returned to the @entity74 , because he wanted to support his students through midterm exams			1
shortly after @entity1 's slaying , the @entity76 removed from its website a video that shows @entity1 talking about his " need to spread a spiritual message , " according to @entity81			1
" i want to go where no one could find a church if they wanted to , where no one has access to this gospel , " @entity1 said of his impending trip to @entity4			1
the church sent only parts of that video to @entity0			2
in one part , @entity1 says , " if there 's any single person in the entire universe that you can take a chance on , it 's @entity97			1
" another clip provided to @entity0 shows @entity1 lovingly looking at his wife , with the sun setting in the background , as he proclaims his strong belief that @entity97 will be with him in heaven			1
" that can never be taken away from me no matter what happens , " he says			0
i 'm ok with that			0
" on @entity1 's personal page on the @entity76 's site , he wrote about his devotion to @entity5			1
" i was raised in the church from the time i was an infant			2
it was only by the grace of @entity97 that i went through my high school and college years free from the major struggles that many of those i knew dealt with			0
it was not always sunshine and lollipops but @entity97 's hand was always leading me and he brought me to where i am today			0
" if the chemistry teacher could spend an evening with anyone who lived in the past 1,000 years , he wrote he would choose @entity127 , a @entity128 theologian who died in 1758			2
@entity127 " understood that @entity97 gave us minds for the soul purpose of glorifying him			0
all of his writings and personal letters are saturated with @entity5 and he always seemed to have the glory of @entity97 in the forefront of his thinking			0
as a man of supreme intellect and prestige , he was refreshingly humble and holy			0
if i could model my life after anyone in the last 1000 years it would definitely be @entity127 , " the teacher posted			0
" @entity1 's greatest desire was for peace and prosperity in @entity4 and for the people of @entity4 to have the joy of knowing @entity97 through @entity5 , " @entity145 , executive pastor of @entity76 , wrote on the church 's site			1
could @entity1 's openness about his beliefs have made him a target ? proselytizing has long been illegal in @entity4			1
since the 2011 revolution there has been a real phobia spreading among certain circles that @entity161 and @entity162 are doing missionary work in the country , particularly in the eastern part of the country			0
earlier this year , dozens of @entity167 were accused of proselytizing and were rounded up in @entity12			1
according to some reports , @entity170 militiamen tortured them			0
pictures released at the time showed piles of bibles and @entity128 children 's coloring books			0
in the spring , the @entity179 in @entity180 said it was worried about the detention and treatment of people held on alleged charges of proselytism in the country			0
in march coptic christians in @entity12 had their church ransacked and set on fire			1
before this attack , @entity167 @entity191 attacked the @entity4 embassy in @entity194 , burned the @entity4 flag and erected a cross over the entrance , according to @entity198			1
around this time , @entity199 , arrested on charges of proselytizing , died while being held in @entity4			1
@entity0 requested to speak with @entity145 , who declined to answer questions and referred @entity0 to church spokesman @entity203			2
@entity203 said that @entity1 was not working as a missionary for the church in @entity4 but that the church does have missionary programs			1
@entity203 declined to say where in the world those missionary programs operate			0
apart from being a country where religious expression could result in arrest or worse , @entity4 has been a particularly dangerous place for @entity215			1
on september 11 , 2012 , militants attacked a @entity218 diplomatic mission in @entity12 , killing four @entity218 , including ambassador @entity219			1
several @entity45 posts on the international school 's site about @entity1 allude to the ambassador			2
@entity223 wrote : " i wish to @entity97 that justice take its way & i hope that @entity97 does not waste his blood like @entity219			0
" " i understand hatred for what the @entity218 government does , " @entity227 posted			0
" this man was not the @entity218 government			0
he wanted to help kids learn			0
" another post refers to @entity234 , an alleged @entity235 operative accused of playing a role in the 1998 @entity218 embassy bombings in @entity238 and @entity239			0
@entity218 special forces captured @entity234 in @entity180 in october			0
he has pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges brought against him in federal court in @entity244			0
" this is exactly what i said a few weeks ago after the stupid @entity218 foreign policy advisers oked kidnapping the wrong guy from @entity4 , " someone posted on the school facebook page			1
" you think his family will just stand still and wait for mercy ? no. they will go around shooting random @entity218 or kidnapping them for revenge			0
this administration killed this teacher by their stupid acts			2
you kidnapped the @entity4 guy and you do n't even have a case against him and you just have him in a jail in @entity244 waiting for nothing			2
and you know you can not bring a case against him because you have no case ... " a leading @entity4 terrorism analyst told @entity0 that he believes @entity1 was killed by groups linked or sympathetic to @entity235			1
" you need to analyze the target , " said @entity269 , a senior analyst at the @entity270			0
" it was most likely he was targeted because of his nationality , and the groups most interested in doing that are @entity235 and local @entity276 allied with them in @entity12			2
" @entity269 pointed to a 17 - minute arabic language video released last week in which @entity218 @entity235 spokesman @entity279 called for @entity235 supporters in @entity4 to avenge @entity234 's capture			1
" i say to the people of @entity4 in particular and the sons of the @entity284 in general : do not leave this criminal cowardly act to pass without punishment , " @entity279 stated , according to a translation by the @entity286			2
three days after @entity234 's arrest , the @entity218 teacher expressed his opinion about @entity170 hardliners			0
@entity1 tweeted : " @entity4 islamists are threatening kidnappings			1
as if they can fit kidnapping in to their 2 hr work day that already includes a nap			0
" @entity0 's @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 contributed to this report .			0
