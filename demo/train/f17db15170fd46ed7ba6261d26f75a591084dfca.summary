if @entity1 were to write a bumper sticker slogan for the past month , it would probably be , " @entity3 did go bankrupt			1
@entity4 is a geopolitical foe			1
" reality is n't quite so simple as to perfectly apply recent developments on @entity3 and @entity4 to the @entity9 debate in 2012 , but neither were @entity1 's arguments on the car industry and on @entity4			1
that did n't stop @entity14 and pundits from using them to beat @entity1 down			0
and it would be a good retort to @entity19 's often - repeated 2012 bumper sticker slogan : " @entity20 is dead and @entity21 is alive ! " @entity19 used the phrase to simultaneously flaunt what the @entity24 administration accomplished in the war on terror and hit @entity1 for his position against the auto bailout			2
@entity1 had different ideas than the president about the war on terror , and he also had outspoken ideas on @entity4 , which he told @entity34 on @entity35 in march of 2012 was " without question our number one geopolitical foe			1
" his statement drew snickers in @entity39 and complaints in foreign policy circles that he was stuck in the @entity42			0
archives : @entity44 criticizes @entity1 's remarks on @entity4 " you do n't call @entity4 our no. 1 enemy -- not @entity49 , @entity4 -- unless you 're still stuck in a @entity42 mind warp , " president @entity24 said at the @entity46 last september			2
the president probably still would n't call @entity4 this country 's top foe			2
but now that @entity4 has given @entity55 leaker @entity54 a year of asylum , and the two countries ca n't find accord on @entity59 or @entity60 , he might choose not to put the line in his convention speech			1
@entity54 asylum could cancel planned @entity24 - @entity65 talks " now is the time to fundamentally rethink our relationship with @entity72 , " sen. @entity66 said upon hearing news of @entity54 's asylum			2
" we need to deal with the @entity4 that is , not the @entity4 we might wish for			0
we can not allow today 's action by [ @entity4 president @entity65 ] to stand without serious repercussions			0
" " @entity4 has stabbed us in the back , " said sen. @entity75 , the @entity77 @entity76			0
he called on @entity24 to protest by demanding the upcoming @entity80 summit for world economic powers be moved away from @entity4			0
@entity19 's slogan , " @entity21 is alive ! " drew a direct contrast between the candidates on the auto bailout that @entity24 engineered after initial action by president @entity87			0
@entity1 's much - cited @entity89 op - ed argued the car industry should be shepherded into a managed bankruptcy and not propped up with taxpayer dollars			1
the headline of @entity1 's op - ed in november 2008 was " let @entity95			1
" that headline followed him all the way to november of 2012 when he lost the election			0
@entity1 's argument in the opinion piece was directed at the car industry , but it foreshadowed last month 's news that the @entity3 the city , once the powerhouse of the @entity9 economy , was going bankrupt			1
" [ @entity108 ] e refused to throw in the towel and do nothing , " @entity24 said in a video message in october of 2012			0
" we refused to let @entity3 go bankrupt , i bet on @entity9 workers , and @entity9 ingenuity and three years later that bet is paying off in a big way			2
" a conservative might apply the high labor costs @entity1 cited as part of the downfall for the auto industry to the cost of government worker pension plans that have helped put the city in trouble			1
how to deal with promises made to public employees is an issue @entity9 will face in the coming decades in places far flung from the @entity3			2
@entity129 : after @entity3 , replace public pensions the federal government has made pretty clear there wo n't be any sort of bailout for the city of @entity3 like there was for the auto industry that lives there			1
@entity139 : why @entity24 wo n't bail out @entity3 campaigns are full of little moments like the @entity3 and @entity4 storylines that may have worked against @entity1			1
more damaging for @entity1 than either the @entity3 op - ed or the @entity4 as a foe storyline was his statement to fundraisers about giving up on the 47 % of @entity9 who would not vote for him no matter what			1
this week we also got the most in - depth explanation from @entity1 on those comments in the form of a book excerpt from @entity156 writer @entity155			2
@entity1 said he was misunderstood			0
more : @entity1 regrets 47 % comments archives : @entity1 does n't back away from message caught on secret tape in politics , eight months is an eternity			0
it 's enough time for the @entity165 to welcome four new grandchildren into the world			0
how @entity3 and @entity4 and the 47 % factored into 2012 are interesting historical questions , but the national dialogue has moved on			1
@entity1 is retired from national politics and the pundits and press have moved on to the 2016 parlor game			0
trio of potential 2016 @entity176 contenders heading to @entity177			0

during the 2012 race , @entity1 was criticized for calling @entity4 the @entity9 ' top " geopolitical foe "
@entity1 was also *haunted* by an op - ed about the auto industry entitled " @entity184 "
now , @entity4 has granted *temporary* asylum to @entity55 leaker @entity54 and the @entity188 of @entity3 is bankrupt
but @entity1 was also hurt in his 2012 @entity191 bid by other controversies like his " 47 percent " comments
