two of @entity2 's best - known female advocates for lifting the ban on women driving were detained on friday after being caught behind the wheel in the country 's capital			1
@entity8 , who was driving the car , and her passenger , @entity10 , tell @entity11 they were pulled over and spent a few hours at a police station in @entity13 until being released into the custody of their respective husbands			1
@entity17 , one of @entity2 's most prominent bloggers , and one of the organizers of the popular october 26 women 's @entity21 , said she decided to go for a spin with @entity23 to attract more attention to her cause			1
" we were looking for the police			2
we drove by the police station on purpose , " she explained , adding how she welcomed the detention			1
despite repeated attempts , @entity11 has been unable to reach @entity13 police for comment			1
@entity23 and @entity17 , who tweets as " @entity35 , " say they have grown tired of waiting for the @entity2 government to allow women to drive			1
" we are sick and tired of waiting to be given our rights , " @entity23 told @entity11			0
" it 's about time to take our rights			0
" @entity23 has driven before and was glad to get behind the wheel again on friday but says she was not deliberately looking to be detained by the police			1
" in a way it is good for the cause because you 'll the keep the issue in the mind of people , " said @entity23			0
" however , some people might understand wrongly that we 're confronting the government and that might slow the process			0
" why @entity2 ca n't ban women from driving forever @entity23 was initially concerned she and @entity17 might go to jail , citing the presence of traffic police , regular police and secret police who were called to the scene			1
she says the mood of the police had lightened substantially by the time she and @entity17 reached the station			1
when her husband came for her , he was asked to sign a statement pledging @entity23 would not drive again			2
@entity23 says her husband jokingly asked , " how can i do that ? i ca n't prevent her from driving			2
only @entity74 can do that , " before signing			0
the issue of women driving is a particularly sensitive and controversial one in @entity2 , the last country on @entity78 where females do n't have that right			1
in recent years , though , more women have challenged the government , urging officials to overturn the ban and taking to streets in remarkable displays of civil disobedience			2
although women are not allowed to drive in the ultraconservative kingdom , there is , in fact , no law barring them from doing so			1
but religious edicts are often interpreted to enforce the prohibition			0
" we have tried all the legal channels , " explained @entity17			0
" the government keeps promising us that all we have to do is be patient and quiet , and we 'll eventually get the right to drive			0
officials keep saying the women driving issue is one for @entity2 society to decide			1
we wanted to prove that really is n't the case and that the only people who really stop us is the police			0
" in may 2011 , @entity106 was jailed for more than a week after posting a video of herself driving in @entity2 online			1
she quickly became a hero to many and inspired dozens of women to drive throughout the streets of various cities in june of that year			1
more recently , in september , a website for the october 26 women 's @entity21 launched , and within a few weeks , tens of thousands had signed an online petition calling for an end to the driving ban for women in @entity2			1
as october 26 approached , numerous women filmed themselves driving in the @entity120 and uploaded those clips to sites like @entity123			1
opinion : give @entity2 women the right to drive in the weeks leading up to october 26 , one @entity2 cleric gave an interview in which he warned that @entity2 women who drove risked damaging their ovaries			1
on october 24 , the country 's @entity130 issued a statement telling women to stay off the streets			2
despite strong opposition by conservative quarters in the @entity120 , where a puritanical strain of @entity138 is practiced , october 26 saw dozens of women taking to the streets and driving			1
the campaign 's backers insist the movement is ongoing and has been a success thus far , while its critics say it has failed			0
last week , @entity23 had an audience with @entity2 's interior minister , prince @entity147 , via teleconference			2
she conveyed a message on behalf of the growing number of women and men calling for an end to the driving ban			2
@entity23 was told the matter was now in the hands of @entity2 @entity157 , considered a cautious reformer			2
" i think it might have been a good thing , " said @entity23			0
" before the government had said the driving issue was a societal issue			0
but now that is not an issue anymore			0
the good thing is now we know clearly that society is not the decision maker			0
" @entity23 added : " we are trying to find a way to reach the @entity157 now			0
we have a letter signed by 3,000 - plus people asking for permission to allow women to drive , and we want to find a way to get that letter to the @entity157			2
" @entity17 , who was detained before for the very same offense , says she will continue pushing the envelope , even if that gets her into legal hot water			0
" i would n't mind if they prosecuted me , " she says			0
" i think it will further the cause			0
it 's good publicity for the cause -- to be prosecuted for being a passenger in a car driven by a woman			2
you ca n't get more medieval			0
