-- @entity1 was seldom at a loss for words			1
his debates with @entity5 , his longtime co-host on a succession of movie - review television shows , sometimes seemed to start before the introduction and often appeared to continue well after the credits rolled			1
he wrote reviews , columns , interviews and articles , an astonishing collection of work that spanned more than four decades with the @entity16 , freelance contributions for magazines such as @entity19 , @entity20 ( @entity1 's movie guide was one of the sources for the popular @entity24 ) and rogerebert.com			1
he hosted festivals for underappreciated films			0
he gave running travelogues from @entity28 and @entity29			0
he tweeted , @entity30 , corresponded with film lovers and held court with words long after his physical voice was silenced by cancer a decade ago			1
@entity1 lost his battle with cancer thursday			1
what a voice he had : firm , plain , brooking no claptrap and telling you exactly what he thought , a throwback , he said , to his newspaper reporter days			1
( @entity46 , then and now , was full of such cheerily blunt personalities : @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 -- perhaps to be expected in the birthplace of " @entity52			0
" ) opinion : @entity1 's sheer love of life above all , he was easy to relate to			1
like many of his readers , i did n't always agree with @entity1 , but i could understand his viewpoint			1
he understood movies were these complex machines of directors and actors and special effects guys and studio suits holding bags of money , machines that -- when they worked -- were magical , like dreams			0
and when they did n't , he could be a compassionate man , more forgiving than many other critics			2
unless he felt as if the filmmakers had betrayed the arrangement between them and the audience			0
then , watch out , because he would say what many of us might want to			0
when @entity78 , the writer - director of the @entity1 - panned " the @entity79 , " called @entity1 a " fat pig with the physique of a slave trader , " @entity1 retorted , " one day i will be thin , but @entity78 will always be the director of ' the @entity79			1
' " he titled one of his books " i hated , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 " ( a line from his review of " @entity92 , " a @entity91 misfire ) and another " @entity1 " ( the closing phrase to an open letter he wrote actor @entity95 )			1
however , @entity1 was as fast -- if not faster -- to give praise			1
he and @entity5 panned the 1987 @entity98 movie " @entity99 , " but both highlighted the performance of a then - little known actor named @entity103 , who played a pimp			1
@entity103 was nominated for an @entity105 , with @entity5 and @entity1 's praise probably playing a key role , since the film came and went quickly			1
and when @entity78 recut " the @entity79 , " @entity1 went to see it again -- and this time , he gave it a coveted " thumbs - up			1
" " the film 's form and purpose now emerge from the miasma of the original cut , and are quietly , sadly , effective			0
it is said that editing is the soul of the cinema ; in the case of ' the @entity79 , ' it is its salvation , " he wrote			0
opinion : what the @entity123 owes to @entity1 thumbs - up the fact that such controversies could make headlines emphasizes the importance of @entity1 to the movies , especially now that we live in a pop culture where everybody 's a critic			1
there had been film critics on tv before @entity5 and @entity1 -- @entity136 and @entity137 among them -- and film criticism had existed since the dawn of the medium			1
but it was generally taken seriously only by cinephiles , the folks who followed @entity145 's @entity144 or @entity147 's @entity146			0
@entity5 and @entity1 made it approachable			1
both were @entity150 , a notable point at a time when most film criticism came from the coasts			1
and , through their tv show , the two approached film criticism the way movie fans , freshly released from a weekend showing at the cineplex , might talk about what they just saw			1
" they turned talking about cinema into an @entity167 pastime , " the @entity163 ' @entity162 wrote in tribute			0
their success was n't guaranteed			0
the pair -- forever immortalized as " the @entity170 " ( @entity5 ) and " @entity171 " ( @entity1 ) -- worked for rival @entity46 newspapers and were regularly at each other 's throats before being paired on a review show , " @entity176 , " in 1976			2
" professionally speaking , their daily aim was to bludgeon each other via newsprint , their medium / blunt object of choice , " wrote @entity177 in his wonderful @entity179 oral history , " @entity186			0
" @entity5 had great contacts ; @entity1 had a @entity188 , the first ever awarded a movie critic			1
@entity1 kept us entertained ' at the movies ' their chemistry , however , was undeniable			2
and as " opening " turned into " @entity176 " turned into " @entity179 " turned into " @entity179 and the movies , " the two became equal parts knockabout vaudeville team -- frequently guesting on @entity199 and @entity201 's late - night shows , where their debates were very obviously unscripted -- and influential movie critics , willing to showcase all variety of new releases in a pre-internet age when middle @entity167 was n't besieged by all manner of movie minutiae and clips were n't a click away			1
they were , in a word , refreshing -- especially for those of us , like me , who grew up far from the film centers of @entity217 and @entity218			0
where else could you get a sense of movies that might never come to your town ? where else could you take part , even from your living room , in the debate between two guys who really knew their stuff , and were entertaining as hell to boot ? the show 's format was frequently copied , but @entity5 and @entity1 were the undisputed kings of the genre -- triumphant to the point where they trademarked their " thumbs - up " summary judgment			1
by the end , the two men had become almost like brothers -- competitive , yes , but also fiercely protective of each other			0
@entity5 died in 1999 , but reading @entity1 's 2011 memoir , " @entity243 , " you 'd think he was still around to needle his fellow critic			2
remembering @entity1 : tweets pour in the balcony is closed @entity1 changed with the times			2
he adapted to the internet quickly , and though he continued with the tv show -- which moved from public tv to syndication in the 1980s -- it was obvious that the new medium was the right place for him			0
( @entity1 finally left the show in 2008 , though guest hosts had been filling in since 2006 ; it was canceled in 2010			2
) " we do n't sit down every saturday night at 6:30 p.m. and wait for a show to come on television , " television executive @entity257 said in " enemies			0
" " people want instant gratification ; they want to read or see his review the moment they decide to go to a certain movie			2
" i think that the @entity123 has provided an enormous boost to film criticism by giving people an opportunity to self - publish or to find sites that are friendly , " he said			1
there were controversies here and there			2
@entity1 was criticized for reviewing a film he 'd only seen a portion of			2
some of his readers believed he 'd gone soft ; just in the last few months , he gave at least three ( out of four ) stars to such panned films as " @entity278 " ( 21 percent on @entity279 ) and " @entity280 " ( 36 percent )			0
but nobody denied his impact			2
he was widely quoted and widely recognized , perhaps the most famous film critic in the world			0
@entity1 in his own words these days , when pop culture runs through the very capillaries of the @entity123 , it 's easy to knock film critics			1
who are they to rain on our entertainment parade ? ca n't we just enjoy the view provided by " @entity295 " without having to think about it ? @entity1 , as the top of the heap , probably heard his name associated with these thoughts more than most			2
what made him special was both his joy in the medium , and his unabashed enthusiasm in asking for something more			0
go ahead and love movies , but give them some thought , too			2
he conveyed all this through his words -- his vital , incisive , energetic , determined words			0
he said it best himself			0
" however you came to know me , i 'm glad you did and thank you for being the best readers any film critic could ask for , " he wrote in his last column , " @entity314 , " published tuesday			0
" thank you for going on this journey with me			0
i 'll see you at the movies			0
" lights down , please .			0

at a time when critics mostly hailed from the coasts , he was a @entity326 people related to
he had a firm , plain , brooking - no - claptrap voice and said exactly what he thought
there were controversies here and there , but nobody denies his impact on movie criticism
