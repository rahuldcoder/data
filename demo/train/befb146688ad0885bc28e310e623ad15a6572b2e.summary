-- an appeals court on monday sided with the federal government in blocking several provisions in @entity4 and @entity6 's controversial anti-illegal immigration laws , while allowing other key parts of those laws to stand			1
advocacy groups like the @entity10 and the @entity11 applauded the decisions , with @entity14 executive director @entity13 saying in a statement they " should send a strong message that state attempts to criminalize immigrants and their loved ones will not be tolerated			0
" still , while three judges from the 11th @entity23 @entity22 did strike down more challenged provisions than they allowed in a pair of rulings , officials from both @entity4 and @entity6 pointed out that the vast majority of their states ' immigration laws remain valid			1
" the essence of @entity4 's immigration law has been upheld by today 's ruling , " @entity4 gov. @entity30 said in a statement			1
" the core of ( the ) law remains if you live or work in the state , you should do so legally			0
" talking about the appeals court decision 's effect on his state 's law , @entity6 attorney general @entity39 said , " while i disagree with the @entity22 's decision on @entity45 , after over a year of litigation , only one of 23 sections of @entity49 has been invalidated			1
" undocumented immigrants line up for relief from deportation while dealing with two different states and laws , both decisions were signed on by a trio of judges -- @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 -- who considered the two cases at the same time			1
the issue of illegal immigration has become a hot - button issue in recent years , with several states passing their own laws in bids to boost local and state law enforcement agencies powers to prevent undocumented residents from living , working and getting benefits in their states			2
political leaders in these states , many of them @entity74 , have criticized the federal government for not doing enough in this regard and argued this lack of action made it imperative that states do more			0
but the federal government has challenged all or parts of many of these laws , insisting that it is the federal governments ' responsibility , and not individual states , to enact and enforce immigration laws			2
the @entity23 @entity90 waded into this debate in june , when it ruled by a 5 - 3 vote to uphold the authority of the federal government to set immigration policies and laws while weighing in on legislation in @entity99 that helped kickstart the debate			0
the court , however , did allow one of the most controversial provisions of that state 's law to stand : letting local and state police check a person 's immigration status while enforcing other laws			1
the rulings monday resembled that high court ruling in many respects , with the appeals court judges ' @entity4 decision even quoting @entity23 @entity90 justice @entity117 's majority ruling on the @entity99			1
" although ( illegal immigration ) is a problem that gives rise to unique issues in our nation , we must be mindful that individual states ' may not pursue policies that undermine federal law , ' " the three judges said			0
one provision the court assessing the two state 's laws did let stand , as the @entity90 had in the @entity99 case , is to allow law enforcement to check the immigration status of those suspected of a crime			2
taking the chance of a lifetime this was one of only two provisions in the @entity6 legislation , known as @entity49 87 , that the federal appeals court considered			1
the other would institute three crimes for " interactions with an ' illegal alien '			0
" these are knowingly transporting such a person " while committing another criminal offense , " " concealing or harboring " an undocumented person and lastly " inducing an illegal alien to go into " @entity6 , according to the appeals court ruling citing the state 's legislation			1
the federal court struck down this aspect of @entity6 's law , known as @entity156 , on monday			1
" we are ... convinced that @entity156 presents an obstacle to the execution of the federal statutory scheme and challenges federal supremacy in the realm of immigration , " the court explained as part of its reasoning			0
four provisions of @entity4 's law were blocked by the appeals court judges on monday , while three still stand despite the federal government 's arguments			1
faces of hope : lining up for two more years in the @entity23 authorities in that state can not make it a crime for undocumented immigrants to work or solicit work , as prescribed by the legislation known as @entity180 but denied by monday 's ruling			2
similarly , the appeals court upheld a lower court ruling and knocked down parts of the law that would have made it a crime to hide " an alien , " to encourage one to live in the state , to transport such a person or agree to a rental agreement			2
the provision prohibiting companies that employ undocumented workers from taking a state tax deduction for wages ( and instituting stiff penalties for those who do n't abide by this law ) was also blocked			0
so , too , was part of the @entity4 legislation to characterized the hiring or employment of a illegal immigrant over a @entity23 citizen or " alien authorized to work " in the country as a " discriminatory practice			0
" yet the federal government 's argument in favor of jettisoning other measures were determined " at this stage ( to be ) facially invalid " by the appeals court			2
that includes checking into a person 's citizenship if a driver does show police his or her driver 's license			0
the court also ruled that @entity4 can prevent illegal immigrants from engaging in a " business transaction " ( except for pursuing a marriage license ) with a state or municipal government agency , as @entity180 states			0
five things to know about big change in policy			0
