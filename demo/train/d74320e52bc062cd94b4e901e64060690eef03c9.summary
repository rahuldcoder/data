for 15 years , @entity0 has devoted her life to the military and to her spouse , an @entity4 lieutenant colonel			1
the former schoolteacher found a new job and made new friends each time she had to relocate bases , including a move to @entity10			0
when a deployment to the @entity13 separated the couple , @entity11 took care of the couple 's young son , @entity16 , on her own			1
now at @entity18 , @entity19 , and with a second child on the way , @entity11 wanted to settle down and get to know more spouses like herself			1
so she applied for membership to the @entity27 ' spouses			0
" i thought , ' here 's a chance to make some close friends who would really understand me , ' " @entity11 said			1
" and i could get very active in events that help other families like mine			0
i was excited , really excited , to be a part of this group			2
" but the @entity18 spouse club apparently did n't feel the same way			1
@entity11 's married to lt. col. @entity38			1
the officers ' spouse club did n't want her , she believes , because she 's gay			1
shortly after @entity11 applied , the club called her to say it had new membership rules			1
if she did n't have a military id card , she could n't join			1
the couple is legally married -- reciting their vows during a november ceremony in @entity48 , and signing a state marriage certificate			0
@entity11 's experience may reflect a struggle at the nation 's military bases to adapt culturally to the legal changes brought on by 2011 's repeal of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			1
brass at @entity18 told @entity58 that they had no control over the spouse club because it 's not a military group , but a private one			1
though gay people can now serve openly , the military does n't formally recognize same - sex marriage under the federal @entity65 , a law passed in 1996 that denies many benefits to same - sex spouses			1
one of those benefits is military ids			2
the cards are an essential part of military life , allowing holders to get on base , access child care or go to the commissary			2
same - sex married couple sues federal government in @entity65 case members - only card " the cards are also a big symbol , " @entity11 recalled			1
" so there i am listening to this person with this club tell me i ca n't join as i 'm struggling to get my 2 - year - old out of the car and into the house			1
and i just kept hearing over and over , ' you do n't have an @entity95			0
you do n't have an @entity95			0
' i was hearing it as , ' you are not equal			0
' " her voice breaks			0
" i kept thinking that if these people just met me , they would like me , " she said , crying			0
when @entity11 hung up , she grabbed a laundry basket and began furiously folding clothes in her bedroom			1
she texted a friend who is also gay , also married to a service member and was himself in the military years ago			2
" how can anyone not in our position know how this feels ? " she asked			0
by that night , she was just plain angry			0
no way was she just going to go away quietly			0
@entity11 posted an open letter to the club on the @entity114 , the nation 's go - to support network for gay , lesbian and transgender military families			1
another club rejection @entity114 launched a petition not only for @entity11 but also for other spouses who 've tried and were barred from joining similar clubs , including @entity124			1
@entity125 , who 's married to a female airman 1st @entity126 , asked to join the @entity128 near @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity131 , in september			2
the club rejected @entity125 , she says , because she does n't have a military - issued @entity95			1
but the group appears to be rethinking its stance			2
its website suggests the club might be considering new membership rules that a military id card is not necessary to join , adding that no one should be blocked from membership because of sexual orientation			1
" they 've told me they 're going to meet this month to decide , " @entity125 said			0
" i hope they do the right thing			0
" but no luck for @entity11 , whose name trended for weeks on @entity149			2
her story is the talk in military circles , with @entity153 writing about it and @entity18 's community posting comments online			1
" this is about more than a spouse who wants to get into a club , " says @entity157 's @entity156 , who helped write the repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell			1
" " this is about the @entity65 and all the inequalities that come with it			0
it 's about asking the question : is the military really going to be serious about giving fair and equal treatment ? " some of the other federal benefits that are available to married heterosexual couples but are denied to same - sex spouses include insurance and survivor 's benefits			1
straight spouses are able to file joint tax returns			0
the @entity177 @entity176 will begin hearing arguments about the constitutionality of @entity65 in march			0
unexpected allies in marriage votes a spouse is a spouse that offers little comfort to @entity11 and her supporters , such as @entity186 , the 2011 @entity187			1
hundreds of thousands of military members voted to give @entity186 that title , singling her out for her community service , patriotism and time spent helping military families			0
she lives in @entity19 but has no affiliation with the spouse club that rejected @entity11			1
" it really makes me ill to think this is happening at @entity18 , " she told @entity58			1
" it 's discrimination , plain and simple			1
" @entity186 is also the deputy membership director of @entity200 -- the largest military family support organization in the nation			1
a @entity204 column recently lambasted the spouse club for rejecting @entity11			1
" who would have thought a group whose sole existence is to help other military spouses and families would deny one of their own ? ... " military wife @entity206 wrote			1
" @entity11 -- i do n't care if you are gay			2
i care that you are a dedicated military spouse who supports your soldier			2
i care that you want to be an example to other spouses and volunteer your time for the benefit of others			0
" i care that you are willing to set up chairs and tables for fundraisers , bring new and innovative ways to raise money for our neediest military families , collate bid sheets , make brownies and raise your hand when the president needs a volunteer			0
" @entity186 's @entity234 husband is preparing to ship out on his fifth deployment , this time to @entity236			0
" we 've gone through 11 years of war , and we need to be supporting each other -- not treating each other like this , " she said			0
" i do n't feel that this club at @entity18 represents who we are as spouses			1
" no help from @entity18 brass @entity58 's many attempts to get the club 's side of the story have been unsuccessful			1
two women who confirmed that they belonged to the club chose not to comment			0
a december 12 letter on the club 's home page reads : " in response to recent interest in the membership requirements of our organization we will review the issue at our next board meeting			2
" the letter does n't indicate when the meeting will be			0
in the wake of the controversy , the group 's website has password protected all its links			2
" they 've locked themselves off to the world ! " says @entity186			0
" no one should be that high up on their pedestal			0
" @entity18 brass says their power is limited			2
that 's because , according to @entity18 @entity281 commander col. @entity281 , the club is a private group , not a military one			1
@entity281 declined an interview with @entity58 , but he e-mailed statements saying he explained that in person to @entity11 and her wife			1
officially , @entity281 has the power only to ensure " all private organizations operating on @entity18 comply with @entity289 and @entity4 regulations and with @entity177 laws			2
" and the spouse club 's bylaws , constitution and conduct do comply with @entity289 regulations			1
" c'mon , really ? that 's a little disingenuous , " said @entity157 's @entity156			0
" when you 're the commander at @entity18 , you are close to having godlike status in your community			2
" @entity281 could deny the club access to the base , @entity156 said			0
" he could tell service members not to participate			0
there are a lot of ways to send a signal that you disapprove			0
" at home this week , @entity11 and @entity309 are busy around the house			2
@entity309 is days away from giving birth			0
@entity11 talks as she heads home from a visit to the doctor			2
after all this , does @entity11 still want to be part of the @entity27 ' spouses ? " honestly , i 'm torn , " she said			2
" each day that goes by , they are saying they do n't want me			0
i check my spam folder every day to make sure i have n't missed a message from them			0
" i wonder if it would be best if i focus on a group who would value me			0

in @entity19 , @entity18 spouse club bars same - sex wife of a lieutenant colonel
the club told @entity0 that without a military id card , she was *ineligible* to join
prominent voices in military circles have rallied behind @entity11
" it 's discrimination , " says an official with @entity200 , a national military family group
