-- when i was growing up , to open my parents ' refrigerator was to take a magical journey deep into a strange land of @entity6 that ultimately ended in sadness , confusion and some sort of round , congealed blob of food that may or may not have dated to the @entity14 administration			1
" @entity16 , what is this ? " " does it look like it might cause infection ? " " kinda			2
" " it 's soup			1
" yes , we were a leftovers house			2
be it chicken or rice , you were gettin ' it twice ! @entity31 , in all fairness , mom has always been a great cook			2
so , it was definitely tolerable			2
nevertheless , day 7 of lasagna never quite had the same pizazz as day 4			2
and opening that container on day 60 risked introducing a newly formed , unknown invasive species into the ecosystem			0
" what the hell was that ? " " might 've been a raccoon ... might 've been a casserole			0
" but , hey , you just ca n't let good food go to waste			1
and that 's why developers at a trending new startup are working on an app called @entity51 that might just revolutionize what we do with our extra grub			1
essentially , they 're creating @entity56 for your unfinished pizza			1
yes , @entity58 just got even weirder			0
here 's how it works : when you have something remaining from your meal , you snap a photo , post it on your profile and then wait for someone nearby to claim it or offer a trade			1
" your chicken salad for my mac - and - cheese ? " " deal ! meet me in the park at 7			0
i 'll be the one with all the open sores			0
what ? " @entity73 and @entity74 are the cofounders of @entity51 , and they came up with the idea three years ago while roommates at the @entity79			0
naturally , at the time , even they thought it was a little crazy			0
@entity74 told @entity82 , " it was an outrageous joke in 2010 , but in 2013 , it 's very plausible and something that people would use today			1
" i swear i 'm not trying to sound insensitive -- seriously -- but the only people i can actually see using this would be homeless dudes who happen to have cell phones			0
otherwise , there 's just too much risk			1
and for what ? tater tots ? actually , that sounds delicious			0
i 'd travel a few blocks for tots			0
( blocks for @entity98 also sounds like the world 's laziest charity walk			1
motto : we 're here to help , but only for about 10 minutes			0
) of course , @entity74 and his business partner are well aware that @entity51 is going to be a hard sell			0
he admits , " it 's obviously not for everybody			1
but for as many people who seemingly have a problem with it , there 's people who love the idea			1
" and maybe there will even be an upscale vintage section so my mom can finally get rid of any petrified brisket lurking in the back of the fridge			0
you know , somewhere on the lower shelf next to the @entity122 turkey			0
yet , despite any eager users that may exist , @entity74 and @entity73 also do n't have delusions of grandeur			2
when they release the app at the end of august , it will be available for free download			2
they 're less interested in making money and more concerned about doing something positive			0
@entity74 says , " in the @entity136 , we produce so much more food than we consume , and so much is going to waste			1
" on the other hand , some of that food is also presently being enjoyed by an unbathed man who 's just emptied his cat 's litter box			1
not with his hands , but still ... and now he ca n't wait to share his half - eaten burrito ! yes , casual encounters definitely just got even weirder			2
follow @entity148 on @entity149 .			1

leftover swap is an app that will allow users to share , trade away uneaten food
developer : " so much is going to waste "
