the name synonymous with @entity4 's mythical kingdom of round tables , opulence and heroism has arrived			0
this ' @entity1 ' is no fantastical castle in a medieval woodland			2
this is a three - year - old colt with designs on a very different fairytale crown			1
trainer @entity15 is not normally prone to lack of self - belief			1
yet even the taciturn @entity17 admits that the bid by his star colt @entity1 to become the first horse since @entity21 to win the @entity22 -- the @entity23 , the @entity24 and the @entity25 -- is " pushing the boat out			1
" the horse with the mythical name has so far lived up to his billing , having swept aside all comers in a fairytale three - year - old campaign that has already seen him capture the @entity23 and the @entity24 , scooping up the @entity34 on the way			1
but in @entity36 he will face the biggest test of his career when he steps up to the one - and - three - quarter mile distance for the first time			0
" it will really expose the horse , " @entity15 admits			1
" we know he has speed and stamina and courage but this is asking for that extra stamina			0
" if @entity1 can handle the extra distance he will join an elite group of just 15 horses who have claimed the world 's oldest continuous sporting competition			2
the last of those , @entity21 , was back in 1970			1
his predecessor , @entity58 , won his treble 35 years before that			0
nowadays , very few horses even attempt the hat - trick -- the extreme versatility required to win races ranging from a mile to one - and - three - quarter miles is simply beyond the repertoire of most three - year - olds			1
" very few have the capacity to do it , " agrees @entity15			2
" for a horse to win the @entity23 over a mile and then go to the @entity24 , if you get the @entity24 trip [ 1Â½ miles ] you 're very lucky			1
now we 're asking him to go that little bit further			0
" a victory in the @entity25 would be the crowning glory of a sensational season for @entity15 , which has seen his @entity79 operation make a clean sweep of all the @entity81 so far -- the @entity23 , the @entity24 and their fillies ' equivalents , the @entity84 and the @entity85			1
tucked away behind wrought - iron gates in a quiet corner of @entity88 , on a misty morning @entity79 captures something of the air of the original @entity1 legend -- @entity4 's symbolic seat and emblem of the @entity4 world			1
if @entity15 represents @entity4 , then his son , 19 - year - old @entity95 , is the trusty @entity96			1
he has ridden the colt in all of his starts to date and will play a decisive role in masterminding his race on sunday			1
it 's a working relationship that demands implicit trust between father and son			0
as far as tactics for the race are concerned			0
" that 'll be left to @entity95			2
i presume he 'll take his time on him , he usually does			0
that 's the way he rides every race , he rides it by feel and takes it as it comes			0
" at just 19 , @entity95 has already ridden more classic winners than most jockeys will in a lifetime			2
but at nearly six - feet tall , the lanky teenager is surely riding on borrowed time as far as a sustained career as a flat jockey is concerned			2
" i try not to think about it too much , " says @entity95			2
" however long i last , i last			0
" a victory in the @entity22 in what may be one of his final seasons on the flat would lend added poignancy to what has already been an omen - laden endeavour ; the last horse to win the @entity22 , @entity21 , was trained at the very same @entity79 stables that @entity15 now occupies by a different @entity15 , legendary trainer @entity134			1
although the two @entity15 clans are not related , it is a further example of how normative determinism has played a fateful role in the colt 's career to date			1
@entity1 's owners -- @entity142			2
@entity143 and @entity144 and mrs @entity145 -- had eagerly awaited a horse to come into their possession who was worthy of the name			0
in the handsome bay with the interrupted white blaze , they found the perfect specimen			0
purchased out of the sales ring as a yearling for 252,000 guineas ( $ 426,018 ) , he quickly asserted himself as one of the leading two - year - olds of his generation			1
in a sport where early promise is not necessarily a guarantee of future staying power , @entity1 has not put a foot wrong , amassing more than $ 2.5 million in prize money over his two seasons on the track , in which he has remained undefeated in all five of his races			2
@entity1 was sired by the great @entity170 , who was also responsible for fellow @entity24 winners @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			1
tellingly , he also sired @entity25 winners @entity175 and @entity177 ( the 2011 champion )			0
@entity170 passed away earlier this year after suffering complications from septicaemia , meaning that a career at stud is now a certainty for @entity1			1
the @entity25 , therefore , will likely be the swansong of his meteoric career			0
the blood that flows through @entity1 's veins is now simply too valuable to risk in further outings on the track			0
despite that , @entity1 is roundly quoted as the favorite for next month 's @entity192 in @entity193 , @entity195 's most prestigious race			1
victory at @entity197 would see @entity1 finally step out of the shadow of @entity21 , who finished second in the @entity192 following his @entity22			1
could @entity1 's owners be tempted to give their colt one final shot at posterity ? it seems unlikely			1
@entity170 's stable at nearby @entity204 -- the nerve centre of the @entity207 ' @entity17 breeding operation -- still has his name above the door , having not been given to another stallion			0
there seems only one likely occupant in the near future			0
but before he can begin to contemplate a future servicing mares , first there is the small matter of the @entity25			0
@entity1 's main challenger will be the @entity219 - trained @entity218 , who represents his trainer 's best chance of landing a treble of his own in the form of three consecutive @entity25 victories			1
@entity15 is realistic about his chances : " everybody knows the @entity22 is very difficult to win			2
" i ca n't tell you how hard it is to win any of those big races			0
we do our very best every day and sometimes it 's good enough and sometimes it 's not			0
" so many things have to happen to get the horse right , get everybody together and for the thing to happen on the day			0
it 's just something that i could n't even dream about			0
" one suspects that @entity15 is dreaming , however ; dreaming of @entity241 racing 's @entity239 .			2

@entity1 aiming for triple crown at @entity25 , winning the @entity24 and 2,000 @entity23
trainer @entity15 admits it will be a big *stretch* for the three - year - old colt
his jockey son @entity95 will be masterminding the race , already racing @entity1 in all of his starts
the last horse to win hat trick was @entity21 in 1970 , also trained at @entity79 stables
