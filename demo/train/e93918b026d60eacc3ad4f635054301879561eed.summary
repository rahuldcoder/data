@entity0 , @entity1 -- an explosive device found in a cargo plane in @entity1 last month probably would have exploded over the @entity6 of the @entity7 if it had not been discovered , @entity3 said wednesday			1
the device was primed to explode about six hours after it was found , a senior @entity7 counterterrorism source told @entity2			1
" forensic examination has indicated that if the device had activated it would have been at 10:30 hrs bst on friday , 29 october 2010 , " the @entity3 statement said			0
" if the device had not been removed from the aircraft the activation could have occurred over the eastern seaboard of the @entity7 " @entity15 , the @entity17 - based arm of the @entity19 terrorist network , claimed responsibility last week for the plot to send explosive devices on cargo planes bound for the @entity7			1
@entity25 spokesman @entity24 said the findings by @entity33 authorities " underscore the serious nature of the attempted @entity15 attack and the challenge we all face in trying to prevent or disrupt such attacks			1
" @entity24 cited " the collective efforts of many dedicated intelligence and law enforcement professionals " in the @entity33 , the @entity37 , @entity38 and the @entity7 for disrupting the attacks			1
" the @entity7 will continue to work closely with these partners and the government of @entity17 to address and counter the threat posed by @entity15 as well as to provide humanitarian and economic assistance to help shape a stable and secure @entity17 , " @entity24 said			1
in a similar statement later wednesday , homeland security secretary @entity43 noted the @entity7 increased screening requirements for air cargo this week and has worked in the past year to make air security a global issue by working with the @entity49			2
authorities in the @entity37 and @entity33 found two explosives - laden packages sent from @entity17 on october 29 that were addressed to synagogues in @entity54 , @entity55			2
the statement by @entity15 claimed responsibility for the two cargo explosives , as well as the september 3 crash of a @entity61 plane near @entity62 in the @entity37			1
it said that because @entity68 media did not link the september crash to the group , " we decided not to announce it so we could carry on a similar operation			0
" " we did that this time using two devices , one of which was sent via the @entity7 @entity61 company and the other via the @entity7 @entity78 company , " the statement said			0
in a security bulletin dated tuesday , the @entity79 and the @entity80 concluded the @entity15 statement was authentic , but they dismissed the group 's claim that it was involved in the september @entity61 plane crash			1
" we assess the statement is authentic and @entity15 's claim of responsibility for shipping the two explosive - laden packages discovered and disrupted on 29 october 2010 is credible , " the bulletin said			1
" the group likely considers the plot a success since its devices evaded cargo screening procedures and likely will cause @entity68 nations to implement costly security countermeasures			0
" according to the bulletin , @entity15 's " assertion of responsibility for the 3 september 2010 crash of a @entity61 cargo plane in @entity62 is false			1
" " other terrorist organizations have falsely claimed credit for events with a high media profile to bolster their image and external perceptions of their operational capabilities , " the bulletin said			0
also wednesday , a @entity7 official said there was no evidence so far that the september 3 @entity61 crash near @entity62 involved terrorism			1
" it is not surprising that they would issue such a claim of responsibility , " the official said of the @entity15 statement			2
" as we have said , we are continuing to take another look at the @entity62 crash but nothing thus far has indicated any nexus to terrorism			1
the available information continues to indicate that the crash was an accident			0
" on october 31 , the @entity37 government announced an investigation of the crash by its @entity132 had eliminated the possibility that an on - board explosion was the cause			2
the two devices that were found on cargo planes , both loaded with the powerful explosive @entity141 , were packed in computer printer toner cartridges and designed to be detonated by a cell phone , a source close to the investigation has said			0
@entity7 investigators believe that @entity19 bombmaker @entity145 , 28 , is linked to the packages , according to a federal official who was briefed by authorities			0
@entity149 , who is thought to be in @entity17 , is a @entity38 who ranked high on @entity38 's list of most wanted fugitives published in february 2009			0
he is also believed to be the bomber who designed last year 's failed attempt to blow up a @entity7 airliner as it landed in @entity156 , @entity157 , on december 25			0
a @entity7 official said that the devices found in the packages last month were very sophisticated and could have exploded in flight , but it was n't clear whether that was the intent			2
the group 's statement said the devices ' designs " allow us the opportunity to detonate them in the air or after their arrival to their ultimate destination , and they are designed to pass through all detectors			0
" the packages were discovered thanks to a tip from @entity38			0
@entity38 officials provided tracking numbers of the two packages bound for @entity184 organizations in the @entity7 , enabling quick tracing to the @entity33 and @entity62 , a source told @entity2			1
after the incidents , @entity7 government authorities grounded packages originating from @entity17 destined for the @entity7			0
@entity17 has asked for outside help to thwart terror groups , but the country , the ancestral home of @entity194 , is still used for operations , @entity7 officials say			2
@entity2 's @entity197 and @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
