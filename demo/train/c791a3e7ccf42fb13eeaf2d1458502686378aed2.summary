@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 woman who potentially faced more jail time than the driver who struck and killed her son last year was spared any time behind bars wednesday			1
@entity8 of @entity0 was sentenced to 12 months of probation and 40 hours of community service by judge @entity11			0
half of those hours must relate to child safety			0
@entity14 has already faced the ultimate nightmare for a mother -- seeing her child die after being struck by a car in 2010			1
she initially faced up to 36 months in jail in connection with the incident -- a sentence six times longer than the time served by the driver of the car that hit her son			1
the case had become a cause for radio talk show hosts , the @entity29 and even transportation advocates , who said @entity14 is being punished because she chose to cross the road at the bus stop across from her apartment instead of traveling to the nearest crosswalk , three - tenths of a mile away			1
" your office 's decision to prosecute @entity8 for the death of her four - year - old son on a vehicular homicide charge is disgusting and inhumane , " wrote one poster to the @entity38 page of the @entity41 solicitor general 's office , which is handling the case			1
more than 135,000 people have signed an online petition calling for leniency			0
" it 's just so confusing and unreal that it would happen in this manner , " said @entity51 , @entity14 's aunt			1
@entity14 and her three children had just gotten off the bus at a stop across from their apartment building in october 2010 when her 4 - year - old son , @entity60 , broke away from her and ran into the street			1
a car struck the boy			2
@entity14 and one of her two daughters also suffered minor injuries			1
five weeks after the accident , investigators came to @entity14 's home , @entity51 said			2
she was charged with three misdemeanors -- second - degree vehicular homicide , failing to cross at a crosswalk and reckless conduct , according to court records			0
a jury convicted her last week			0
each count carried a potential sentence of one year in jail			2
the man driving the car , @entity82 , fled the scene after the accident , but later admitted being involved , according to @entity2 affiliate @entity85			0
he was sentenced to five years in prison , but served only six months			0
he is serving the remainder of the sentence on probation			0
a representative of the @entity41 solicitor general 's office said the agency could not comment on the case until sentencing is complete			2
the @entity29 called the case against @entity14 a " grave miscarriage of justice when the mother who is still grieving is forced to fight harder for her freedom than the man who killed her son			1
" the case has also attracted attention from transportation advocates , who say @entity14 is being treated unfairly because transportation planners fail to take into account the needs of pedestrians when designing roads			1
" because she did as her fellow bus riders , who crossed at the same time and same place , and because she did what pedestrians will do every time -- take the shortest reasonable path -- she is guilty of vehicular homicide , " transportation for @entity120 communications director @entity119 wrote on the advocacy organization 's blog			0
@entity14 had hoped to receive a minimal sentence tuesday , @entity51 said			2
@entity2 's @entity124 contributed to this report .			0

a @entity1 woman whose son was struck and killed will not go to jail
@entity14 , 4 , died in 2010 when he ran into *traffic*
transportation advocates and the @entity29 called the case an *outrage*
