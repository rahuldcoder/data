@entity0 -- the moment is iconic			0
the @entity5 chamber is buzzing			1
millions of @entity6 are waiting to hear the state of their union			0
and then the voice : " mr. speaker , the president of the @entity6			2
" on tuesday night , @entity12 will introduce president @entity13 before his @entity15 address			1
but for 17 years , it was @entity17 whose booming voice kicked off the event with those eight words			1
the crowd would applaud and the president would stride into the @entity5 chamber , shaking hands and greeting members of @entity25 from both sides , about to fulfill an important constitutional provision			1
@entity17 , a soft - spoken 76 - year - old who retired last year , called this part of the job " sort of not my ilk			1
" @entity17 never expected to introduce the president when he became @entity5 sergeant at arms in 1995			1
before then , the duties of announcing the president , he said , fell to the @entity5 doorkeeper			1
but @entity17 was tapped for the honor after then - house speaker @entity38 got rid of the doorkeeper job			1
" i started practicing , " he said last week with a laugh			0
" and practiced and practiced and practiced and practiced			0
in my office , i practiced ; at home , i practiced , in the car because i did n't want to get that wrong			0
" @entity17 had an office just off the @entity5 floor			1
" the first time i did it , " he said , " i was concerned even though it was only eight words			0
so i wrote it in a piece of paper , and i kept it in my hand			0
the next year , i wrote it on a piece of paper , and i kept it in my pocket and from then one it was really relegated to my pocket			2
" he started every @entity15 until he stepped down last year , welcoming presidents from @entity64 to @entity13			1
in total , he introduced the president 20 times , including in joint sessions of @entity25			2
at a december 2011 event honoring his career , house speaker @entity69 reflected on @entity17 's 17 years of service in the chamber			1
" an example of class and humility , @entity17 has led us through the unthinkable , " @entity69 said			2
" @entity17 enters the books as a good law enforcement officer , a good criminal investigator , and above all , a good and decent man			2
@entity17 , we 're sorry to see you go , but on behalf of the whole @entity5 , thank you for your service			1
" @entity84 and former speaker @entity85 also acknowledged him			0
" announcing the president at the annual @entity15 address has made @entity17 known in the homes of many @entity6 families , and his service of nearly 17 years , and under four different speakers of the @entity5 , puts him in the history books , " she said in a statement			1
some of the best moments of those introductions , @entity17 said , occurred when he had a chance to say hello to the leader of his nation			2
" every one of them has just been unbelievable as far as being nice , and they talk to you , " @entity17 said			2
" i usually say i 'm glad you 're here mr. president because to me it does n't matter who is our president			0
" introducing the president is by far the most high - profile few seconds of the job , but it is n't the only duty			0
the sergeant at arms is the chief law enforcement officer for the @entity5 , responsible for the overall security of the legislative body			1
he also is part of a three - person group that oversees the @entity120			0
most of the job is behind the scenes			0
@entity17 said he was n't offended when people asked him what else he did on @entity126			2
instead , he said , he felt honored that introducing the president was so high profile			0
" i think for 17 years , we are used to seeing the sergeant at arms , or me , doing it , and i hope they felt as comfortable seeing me there as i felt being with them out there , " @entity17 said			1
" and it took me awhile to be comfortable ... but i really did become comfortable			0
" @entity17 was sergeant at arms during some difficult years that included the anthrax attacks on @entity126 offices			1
he also helped @entity142 security systems after the september 11 attacks			0
before joining the @entity5 , @entity17 had a decorated career in the @entity145 for 33 years			1
he was protecting one of vice president @entity148 's daughters at the time of president @entity151 's assassination and was a senior adviser to three directors at the @entity145 's @entity154			0
when @entity17 stepped down from the job in january 2012 , @entity12 , another @entity145 veteran , replaced him			1
the two are close , and @entity17 talks about @entity12 like a proud father			1
" i 'm very proud of my replacement because he 's outstanding and he 's a good guy , " @entity17 said			2
" i 've known him ; he came from @entity145			0
" as for whether he would do it again , @entity161 laughed and said his " time has passed			0
" " it 's time for someone else , " he said			0
" but i really did enjoy it and that is -- i think of all the things that changed for me -- that is one thing that changed rather rapidly -- the enjoyment of it			0

for 17 years , @entity17 introduced the president at the @entity15 address
as @entity5 sergeant at arms , @entity17 introduced every president from @entity64 to @entity13
