-- @entity1 had a hit in the 1980s called " @entity3			2
" she has a point			0
it may or may not buy happiness , but money -- especially truckloads of it -- does change things , including endowing the holder of the checkbook with power			1
now , take a teenager and give him that power			2
what happens ? @entity16 , @entity17 and the other teen stars that have crashed to earth in a shower of tabloid sparks , may only be doing what a great many teenagers would be doing -- if they could			1
there are teenagers like @entity16 on every block			1
but imagine the kid who cuts your lawn suddenly having a net worth of about $ 130 million			2
the same teen brain that convinces its host that he wo n't get caught if he throws a party at the house while mom and dad are away now knows it owns the house -- and it 's a mansion , with @entity42 outside loaned gratis by a friendly dealer			1
woohoo ! it 's long been said that by age 5 or 6 , a child 's brain is 95 % of its adult size			0
but neuroscientists , enlightened by @entity51 technology , are discovering it is still changing -- creating connections , adding and shedding cells			0
that process is particularly active in the prefrontal cortex -- the part that makes judgments like drag racing through residential neighborhoods			0
dr. @entity61 at the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 , led studies that found the teen brain development was a process of adding and pruning			0
significantly , he said , brain cells at that age are influenced by what the teen does			0
if he plays sports , the brain cells will make connections that help with that			0
if he sits on the couch and plays video games , then the cells will be hardwired for those activities			0
the only real moderating influence -- as it is for any teenager -- is the parents			1
but instilling discipline and values can be a daunting exercise when the child is the breadwinner			1
it can be difficult to tell your child they ca n't have the car tonight -- when he 's the one who paid for it			1
some parents -- like the @entity95 -- are simply not up to the job			1
others -- like the parents of @entity99 or @entity100 -- may have had their job complicated by what appear to be mental problems			1
unfortunately , today , those problems are there for all to see			0
every failure of a troubled celebrity teen spreads like digital wildfire			0
still , for every @entity16 , there is a @entity109 , @entity110 or @entity111 -- child stars who navigated the rocky shoals of teen years into successful adulthood			1
actor @entity116 , in an interview , said he raised well - adjusted child star sons , @entity119 and academy - award winning @entity109 , by removing their money from the family 's life			2
" we chose not to live on what the boys could afford , " he said , " but what i could afford			0
" let 's hope @entity16 will find his way			1
but romping in a mountain of money like most kids play in a pile of leaves , and surrounded by an entourage of dependent cheerleaders , wo n't make it easy			0
as the developing cells of his teenage brain react to the world around him -- money does change everything			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			2

@entity147 : there are teenagers like @entity16 on every block
@entity147 : a young *person* who has so much money -- and power -- can do crazy things
she says parents can instill values , but it 's hard when a kid is the breadwinner
@entity147 : still , there are teen stars who grow up fine even if they have a lot of money
