@entity0 -- actress @entity2 was under house arrest early friday , authorities said , after she turned herself in early to begin a sentence for jewelry theft conviction			1
@entity2 showed up three weeks early at a @entity0 jail to begin serving her sentence , @entity8 's spokesman @entity7 said thursday			1
it was determined that she would serve her time under house arrest because of overcrowding at the facility , authorities said			2
she was fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor her movements and ensure she stays at home , except as allowed by the court , @entity7 said			1
the actress was sentenced may 11 to 120 days in jail , but overcrowding at the facility and state rules could reduce the time she must be confined to her @entity25 , @entity26 , home , the sheriff 's office said earlier			1
@entity2 , 24 , pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor theft charge after she apparently left a @entity25 jewelry store in january wearing a gold and diamond necklace she had not paid for			1
@entity34 judge @entity33 gave @entity2 until june 17 to begin the sentence , but she reported to the jail early on thursday , @entity7 said			1
once there , it was determined that she was eligible for home confinement instead of jail , he said			1
early release formulas , required by a federal order to reduce jail overcrowding , will likely reduce the sentence to about 14 days , @entity7 said after the sentencing			0
" because of budget constraints and because we 're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation , nonviolent offenders , lesser crimes , get 20 % of their sentence , " the spokesman explained			0
@entity33 remarked that the discounts on the sentences " seem to be like shopping at @entity53			0
" as part of @entity2 's sentence , @entity33 also ordered that the actress remain on supervised probation until she completes 480 hours of community service			1
but the judge rejected deputy city attorney @entity63 's request for substance abuse counseling for the actress			0
@entity33 said drugs and alcohol are not the root of @entity2 's legal troubles , but " she 's got other problems for which she self - medicates			2
" @entity2 's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken driving arrests in 2007			2
since then , she 's spent more than eight months in substance abuse rehabilitation programs			0
after her sentencing , the court released a probation report that said the actress " appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues			0
" " it would appear that the defendant 's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity , " the probation report said , yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail			0
@entity2 tested positive for alcohol use , a violation of probation rules , in february , the report said			2
it also revealed that the drug test failure last august , which resulted in a jail sentence and court - ordered rehab , involved cocaine and amphetamines			0
@entity2 was not at the may 11 hearing , but her lawyer entered a no - contest plea to the misdemeanor theft charge on her behalf			1
" i am glad to be able to put this past me and move on with my life and my career , " @entity2 said in a written statement released by her lawyer			2
" i support the judge 's decision and hold myself accountable for being in this situation			0
" @entity1 's @entity111 contributed to this report .			0
