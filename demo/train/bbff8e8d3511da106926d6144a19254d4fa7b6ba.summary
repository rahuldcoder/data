in january 2014 , 22 - year old @entity0 left his home in the @entity4 town of @entity5			1
he was due to travel to @entity6 to see his grandparents , but never arrived			2
instead , @entity0 went to @entity8 , called his family from somewhere in @entity10 , and then vanished into @entity11			1
his family and friends were stunned			2
one friend told the local newspaper @entity15 : " he does n't even speak @entity16 very well			0
" on friday , the day after @entity4 police killed two extremists during a raid in @entity5 , a @entity1 crew met @entity0 's mother and sister at her home , just a few hundred yards from the scene of the shoot - out			1
at the time , @entity4 media were suggesting he may have returned to @entity5 and been killed in the police raid			1
they were too upset to talk ; at that moment , they had no idea whether @entity0 was alive or dead			0
the imam of the local mosque , @entity33 , told @entity1 they had not seen @entity0 since 2013			0
he had been a serious but kind boy and had worked in a local restaurant , the imam said			0
@entity33 and the president of the mosque @entity37 said that extremism was not common among @entity39 in @entity5 but that fewer young people were attending the mosque and instead were being influenced elsewhere			0
while the identities of the two men killed in the police raid have not been disclosed , it now seems @entity0 is still alive and likely still in @entity11 or @entity45 -- one of dozens of young @entity4 men and women who have left their dreary , industrial towns to wage jihad in @entity45 and @entity11			1
a recent study by the @entity53 in @entity54 estimated that at least 250 individuals have left @entity4 -- fewer than the number from @entity57 and @entity58 but the highest in @entity59 when measured per capita			1
other sources put the number above 300			0
one of them posted a photograph of himself brandishing an automatic weapon and with an ammunition belt round his neck			0
calling himself @entity71 , he said he came from @entity72 , a small town on the @entity75 border			0
he was reportedly the fourth resident of @entity72 to leave for @entity11			1
@entity77 ' travel tips another @entity4 jihadist with a high profile is @entity80 , a 27 - year - old @entity4 of @entity6 descent from a suburb of @entity83			1
an @entity85 video posted in march last year shows him in a truck towing four dead bodies away in the aftermath of a massacre			1
@entity80 's 13 - year old brother also arrived in @entity11 later -- to become reputedly the youngest foreign fighter there			1
@entity4 analyst and historian @entity92 says jihadists help each other with travel advice through social media			1
one posted on @entity98 : " everything you need is available here , be it clothes or things for your home , we have everything			0
" and a tip : " do n't behave like a warrior			0
shave your beards , behave like tourists and buy tickets back and forth			0
" @entity111 figures on the number of @entity59 who have gone to @entity45 and @entity11 -- and which groups they have joined -- are hard to come by			1
the consensus among counter-terrorism analysts is that more than 3,000 have traveled , of whom 500 have returned , including up to 70 who have come back to @entity4			1
of those who have gone , there appears to have been a sharp shift toward joining the @entity122 in @entity45 and @entity11 ( @entity85 ) in the last year			1
@entity92 writes : " if there is one important difference between those who left during the first wave and the second it would be their favor to fight for the @entity122			2
" and @entity85 has made it clear it plans to send fighters to @entity59 , once western forces are , in its words , " defeated " in @entity45 and @entity11			1
an outlawed group called @entity136 is suspected of arranging the travel of some would - be jihadists			1
nearly fifty of its members are currently on trial in @entity142 , but almost all are being tried in absentia			0
@entity144 , an investigative journalist with @entity4 newspaper @entity145 who tracks jihadist networks , told @entity1 that @entity136 had disbanded because of prosecutions and the flow of members to @entity11			1
" as an informal network though , i think it still exists			0
and from time to time , people try some kind of relaunch , " @entity144 said			0
one of the group that went to fight is @entity157 , a @entity4 - @entity6 from @entity142 in his twenties who is believed to be in @entity160 -- @entity85 's self - declared capital -- and has a @entity98 page in the name of @entity164			1
after the attack on a @entity168 museum in @entity4 by a gunman accused of allegiance to @entity85 , he wrote on @entity98 page : " may @entity172 raise up more young people who take the example of those who committed the attack in the @entity167			1
" " third generation " analysts of @entity180 extremism in @entity59 talk of a " third generation " -- @entity183 teenagers and men in their early twenties intensely alienated from the countries to which their parents and grandparents immigrated in hope of a better life			1
a significant minority among them feel marginalized within their own country ( they have no experience of any other ) and are enticed by @entity85 's slick multilingual propaganda machine			1
some even see the @entity197 brothers , who attacked the offices of @entity199 in @entity200 as heroes ; there were a number of incidents in @entity58 schools when the minute 's silence for the victims was interrupted			0
one college teacher in a suburb of @entity200 with a high @entity183 population told @entity1 that since the @entity200 attacks some @entity183 students had adopted the slogan " @entity213 , " as a riposte to " @entity215			0
" few of them will ever pack their bags , but they could easily be further radicalized at home			0
most of those who do make it to @entity11 are raw recruits with few skills			2
but they learn fast -- and one worrying dimension of the conflict to @entity226 analysts is the coming together of this " third generation " with veteran jihadists -- men like @entity230			0
now 48 , @entity230 left prison in 2011 after serving a long terror sentence			2
he is thought to have trained in @entity233 , and as a young man had been condemned to death in his native @entity6 for trying to overthrow the monarchy			0
on @entity98 last year he suggested he was in @entity237 , @entity11			2
his current whereabouts are unknown			0
while @entity59 intelligence agencies scramble to tackle the first wave of returnees , some analysts offer a few crumbs of comfort			2
among the hundreds who have followed their dream of jihad , some never imagine returning home			2
@entity251 , a young @entity75 and former soldier , told a @entity75 television network that he did not expect to come home , far less commit an attack in @entity256			0
others are killed or become suicide bombers ; a few return home disillusioned with the violence			0
tracking fighters the @entity53 study says the threat posed by foreign fighters could be reduced by better co-operation among @entity59 intelligence services			1
" intelligence from the communications of foreign fighters , shared open - source monitoring , and other information obtained by one service can prove crucial for discovering transnational networks , " it says			2
@entity144 says that given their modest resources , the @entity4 security services have been pioneers in tracking fighters			1
" i truly think , for example , that the @entity281 attack would n't have happened with a perpetrator from @entity4 itself , " he told @entity1			2
four people were shot dead at the museum in @entity83 last year			0
the alleged assailant -- a @entity58 national named @entity286 -- was arrested in @entity58 , highlighting the additional problem posed by @entity59 's open borders : 26 @entity59 states are part of the @entity291 , which abolished passport and immigration controls between signatories			2
in @entity200 , analysts and former officers in the security services have long been critical of the lack of collaboration between @entity58 's police and the domestic and foreign intelligence services in the wake of the @entity200 attacks			0
that lack of communication became apparent after the @entity307 shootings in 2012 , when @entity308 killed seven people across several days in @entity307			0
governments in northern @entity59 now face threats on multiple fronts , from loosely - organized cells with ready access to weapons , and in many cases the expertise to use them			1
last july @entity318 and @entity319 warned in the @entity320 that " policy makers ' unrealistic obsession with foreign fighters could be a distraction from a more serious domestic terrorist threat			2
" the unfortunate lesson to be drawn from recent events in @entity200 and @entity4 is that policy makers now need to focus on both .			2

at least 250 individuals are believed to have left @entity4 to wage jihad in @entity45 and @entity11
analyst @entity334 says would - be fighters help each other with travel advice through social media
@entity85 has made it clear it plans to send fighters to @entity59 , once western forces are " defeated "
