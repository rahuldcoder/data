the goal of the anti-government gunmen was to protect the anti-government demonstrators , who have repeatedly come under fire from security forces during the past two months			0
last week , @entity23 's government faced condemnation from the @entity25 and others for the killing of as many as 50 anti-government demonstrators in @entity4			1
the unrest came shortly after @entity33 state - run @entity31 television reported monday that @entity23 president @entity34 had undergone two operations in @entity33 and would return to @entity23 after he recovers			1
@entity34 is in @entity33 for treatment following a rocket attack on his presidential compound on friday			2

he 's " under a lot of political pressure , " the official said			0
the official added that acting president @entity73 is " probably not a long - term player , but ( is ) a caretaker for the regime , " although he could become a @entity77 candidate in any future elections			2

@entity91 will try to establish a foothold in other areas of @entity23 -- either alone or allied with others , the official said			1

" we rely on the @entity23 government as partners			2
the more the government is distracted by the political unrest , the more difficult it is for us			0
" the @entity23 government has had a " big impact on acquiring information on @entity91 , " said the official , adding , " if that information flow slows or stops , it inhibits our ability to gather information			1
" the official would not comment on whether the instability is an opportunity for the @entity50 to take more aggressive actions in @entity23			1
