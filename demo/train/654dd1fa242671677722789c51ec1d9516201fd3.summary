@entity0 , @entity1 -- to win the @entity4 beauty pageant requires beauty , grace , talent and a strong stomach			1
it 's probably the only pageant in the country that requires the winner to decapitate and skin a snake			1
" tomorrow i get to skin snakes and chop their heads off , and i am super-excited about it , " said @entity13 , miss @entity4 2011			1
the pageant kicks off the annual @entity20 festival in this @entity1 town			1
hunters from as far away as @entity23 catch as many snakes as possible in the countryside then bring them to the county coliseum for the festival			1
" this event is a way for us to help control the population of the western diamondback rattlesnake in our area , " says @entity28 , a volunteer with the @entity29 who run the event			1
the roundup began more than 50 years ago as a way to combat the rattlesnake population that was killing livestock and threatening pets and even people			1
" the rattlesnakes were literally coming into @entity0 , down the streets looking for water , " says @entity28			1
" they bite livestock , they bite the animals , your pets			2
they 'll bite kids , people			2
they 're a very serious problem around here			2
" the roundup has become a huge part of the town 's identity			2
the @entity29 say 30,000 to 50,000 people attend the roundup each year			2
it 's become as much party as public service event			2
" we have a lot of fun doing it			2
we 're all @entity29 back here in the snake pits , " @entity28 says			1
@entity71 and @entity72 left their wives at home in @entity76 , @entity1 , and brought their sons to the roundup			0
they hired a guide to take them snake hunting and then brought their box full of snakes to the event			1
" we saw this as a rite of passage to be able to bring your boys out here and let them see how you have good clean fun and learn something and appreciate nature , " says @entity71			0
" it 's one of the ways we are going to raise these boys into men			0
" the guide uses gasoline fumes to drive the rattlers out of their dens			0
the dads then use long handled tongs and hooks to corral the snakes			0
@entity72 says he has dreamed of coming to the @entity20 since he was a boy			1
" for me it 's been a bucket list thing my entire life			0
" the roundup is clearly more fun for the humans than the snakes			0
the rattlesnakes are dumped into a large pen with hundreds of other snakes			0
they are weighed and measured and their venom is milked into glass beakers where it will be used for research and to make anti-venom			0
it goes down hill from here			0
next comes the chopping block where their heads are cut off			0
they are then skinned and gutted			0
the meat is fried up and the skins are used for boots and wallets			0
for $ 10 , visitors can take a turn at snake skinning			1
to record their feat they rub their hands in snake blood and leave handprints on the wall			1
it 's a little gory , but no one seems bothered , including miss @entity4 2011 @entity13 , who showed up to take her turn in the skinning pit			1
@entity147 and sash in place and machete in hand , she steps up to the block and takes a swing -- and another , and another -- before the head finally comes off			0
undeterred , she picks up the snakes body with one hand and gives a beauty queen wave with the other as cameras click away			0
" only in @entity0 , " she says			0
" i would of never imagined in a million years that i would be miss @entity160			1
