@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 intrigued me because i have never lived there before			1
the only memory i have is from when i was a child			2
when i was in primary school , one of my distant relatives died and i attended her funeral in a village in @entity13 province			1
i remembered the wooden houses , running dogs and chickens , and the smelly latrine â € ” i always feared that i would fall into it			2
i also tripped a million times on the muddy and rocky roads			2
i guess i am the @entity21 who did n't go down the rabbit hole until older			2
after i arrived in @entity0 , a tiny town of 17,000 people , in august 2012 , what shocked me most was not the stunning beauty of the terraced fields or the fact that most residents here lived below the poverty line , but how globalized everyone was			2
more than 10 cell phone stores were crowded into the condensed downtown area			2
young people wore fake @entity37 and @entity38 clothing and used smart phones that resembled iphones			2
they played " @entity45 " by @entity41 at loud volume and watched @entity43 together on tv			0
however , i never saw a single person hold a newspaper or a book outside the school i was assigned to			1
the only reading materials are either about pig feed and pesticide or the family planning campaign			0
families do n't attach much importance to education and many students quit even though education is compulsory until the age of 16			1
at the beginning of the school year , 68 students registered in my 7th grade class of 12 and 13 - year - olds			1
at the end of my first year , the number had dropped to 54			1
most of the drop - outs became underage migrant workers in nearby cities ; some stayed at home to farm			1
two girls i knew got married and are now bearing babies			0
the ones who chose to stay were not easy to teach either			0
due to a lack of early education and a poor academic foundation , many students are far behind the curriculum			1
every day , i felt like coaching 54 teenagers afraid of walking to run a marathon with me			0
together we faced many difficulties , such as lack of motivation and a sense of inferiority			0
it 's hard to blame the parents			1
i held a parent conference at the beginning of the school year			1
the parents of 42 of the 54 students showed up			1
when i asked them to sign their names , half of them could n't and had to ask my student to help write ; the other half who could kind of did it with shaky hands and squiggly handwriting			1
i visited the homes of my students more than 70 times in my first year of teaching and got to know more about the community			1
they live in houses made of wood or cement			0
even though electricity is available ; families still use firewood or dried corn stalks as fuel to cook so the kitchen usually looks dark and smoky			0
in almost all encounters with parents , i felt hospitality and respect			1
they seemed to trust me in every educational decision made for their kids , even though i am an outsider and much younger than them and i occasionally needed translation to understand the local dialect			0
many of the parents told me : please scold and beat my son or daughter whenever necessary			1
you can not blame local teachers either			0
even though they earned an unexpectedly low salary , had a heavy class load , and worked for six days a week , some made time to learn and improve their teaching			0
they eagerly came to observe my classes and asked for advice about how to make their classes lively and engaging			0
they also celebrated my birthday with me and invited me to events like karaoke and barbecues			0
i felt grateful for their acceptance and the responsibilities offered to me			0
this semester my classroom was equipped with a " smart ' whiteboard and a computer but students still have to share dilapidated wooden desks due to lack of funds			2
before i joined @entity162 , i wanted to pursue academic study in anthropology			0
this goal has changed due to my experience in the classroom			0
i fell in love with teaching			0
i want to become an exceptionally excellent teacher -- a person who listens to and answers her students ' needs , who kindles a fire to learn in each kid and turns every possible moment into a learning fiesta			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			1
