@entity0 -- so just why is 1999 suddenly such a flashpoint in @entity3 ? @entity4 says 1999 is the birth year of " the @entity6 " and goes on to suggest that @entity7 might have committed a felony			2
that provoked a rare statement from @entity7 campaign manager @entity11 , who called on president @entity12 to apologize for " the out of control behavior of his staff , which demeans the office that he holds			1
" pointed rhetoric aside , just what is the 1999 debate about and why is it potentially significant in the @entity12 versus @entity7 race ? @entity23 : documents -- @entity7 did n't manage @entity26 funds at issue is whether @entity7 , the former governor of @entity28 , is telling the truth when he says he had no role in investment and operations decisions at @entity33 once he left in february 1999 to take over the @entity34			1
@entity35 this week questioned @entity7 's claim by citing @entity38 filings listing @entity7 as @entity26 's top officer after 1999			1
the @entity40 on thursday carried a similar account -- and that was seized upon by @entity4			0
" either @entity7 , through his own words and his own signature , was misrepresenting his position at @entity26 to the @entity38 , which is a felony , or he was misrepresenting his position at @entity26 to the @entity51 people to avoid responsibility for some of the consequences of his investments , " @entity43 , deputy @entity12 campaign manager , said on a campaign conference call			1
remember that last part of @entity43 's statement -- about responsibility for " his " investments			0
but first , is there anything other than the @entity38 filings to suggest a hands - on @entity7 role at @entity26 post-february 1999 ? no is the word from four sources who communicated with @entity1 on thursday -- all of whom have firsthand knowledge of @entity26 's operations at the time in question			1
three of the four are @entity74 , and two of the four are active @entity12 supporters in @entity3			2
all four told me @entity7 is telling the truth			0
only one , @entity26 managing director @entity79 , would talk on the record			0
the others spoke only on condition of anonymity , citing either @entity26 's low - key culture or the desire not to anger friends in the @entity12 campaign			1
@entity79 , a @entity88 who unsuccessfully ran for @entity89 in 2010 , told @entity1 : " @entity7 left @entity33 in february 1999 to run the @entity90 and has had absolutely no involvement with the management or investment activities of the firm or with any of its portfolio companies since the day of his departure			2
" in explaining the @entity38 documents filed in 2000 and 2001 , @entity79 said , " due to the sudden nature of mr. @entity7 's departure , he remained the sole stockholder for a time while formal ownership was being documented and transferred to the group of partners who took over management of the firm in 1999			1
accordingly , mr. @entity7 was reported in various capacities on @entity38 filings during this period			0
" another @entity26 @entity88 who did not want to be identified by name said @entity7 had no role after taking the @entity90 post " nothing			2
and it happened very suddenly			0
... after that , he was not on calls or writing memos			0
" to be clear , all four of the sources voiced professional loyalty and personal respect for @entity7			0
and all four have a vested interest in defending the work of @entity26			0
but they were consistent in describing @entity7 's departure as abrupt and in saying they could not recall him around the office in the months that followed			1
two highly reputable arbiters of political debate -- the @entity137 's fact - checking arm and @entity138 -- also on thursday stood by their earlier findings that @entity7 stepped away from any active role at @entity26 when he accepted the @entity90 post			1
and @entity23 reported that it obtained private @entity26 documents that support the @entity7 account			1
but the @entity12 campaign and its liberal allies continue to hang their claim on the @entity38 filings			1
why so important for them to try to stretch the calendar of @entity7 's @entity26 tenure ? for starters , just suggesting @entity7 is n't telling the truth fits the arc of recent @entity12 character attacks on the @entity157 hopeful , including questions about why he wo n't release more of his tax records			1
more significant , though , is that @entity43 statement about responsibility for " his " investments			0
@entity164 blogs were quick to list @entity26 - tied companies that lost jobs in late 1999 and beyond -- and just as quick to suggest it is now fair game to blame @entity7			2
and inside both @entity26 and the @entity7 campaign , there is a strong belief that either the @entity12 campaign or a @entity74 ally wants to use another @entity26 investment against @entity7 late in the campaign but can not do so with any credibility under the february 1999 departure scenario			1
the investment in question : @entity180 , a medical waste company that , among other things , disposed of aborted fetuses			0
how could the @entity180 investment be used against @entity7 ? @entity26 's involvement in a company that disposed of aborted fetuses could make a powerful final week direct mail piece or attack ad on christian radio			1
and in a close election , turnout of the religious right is one of the keys to a @entity7 victory in november			0
@entity26 negotiated the @entity198 investment deal in november 1999 , nine months after @entity7 said he left			2
@entity26 's investors pour money into numbered investment pools			0
several sources said that @entity203 was the main investment vehicle at that time			0
" you do n't see his name anywhere -- in the meetings list , the investor documents , the manager paperwork -- it would have to be there if he was involved in any way , " one current @entity26 officer said of @entity7 and @entity206 " he was long gone then			2

@entity12 campaign says @entity7 lying about involvement with @entity26 after he left
@entity7 campaign chief says @entity12 should apologize for " out of control " campaign
four sources -- three of them @entity74 -- support @entity7 side of dispute
@entity12 campaign wants to tie story to other attacks on @entity7 's character
