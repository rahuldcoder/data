-- foreign auditing firms will have to appoint a @entity3 national as their chief partner in @entity3 as part of a sweeping overhaul of the country 's accounting industry			1
the regulations , unveiled on thursday , are aimed at localising the mainland operations of foreign auditing firms , but they also provide for a lengthy transition period and wiggle room to limit controversy over the changes			1
@entity3 auditing standards have come under fire over the past year after a number of fraud allegations against @entity3 companies listed in overseas markets			1
the restructuring of the @entity3 operations of foreign auditing firms , including the " @entity24 " , threatened to fuel concerns by forcing them to replace all of their foreign partners with @entity3 partners			1
@entity30 has tried to allay such fears , however , by giving foreign groups time to adjust			0
up to 40 per cent of their partners in @entity3 will be allowed to continue operating without @entity3 qualifications this year , the finance ministry said			2
that cap will then be reduced to 20 per cent by the end of 2017			0
" they have made huge concessions here to try to have a smooth transition , " said @entity39 , a professor of accounting at @entity41			0

" the normal situation in the world is that accounting firms must be owned by locally qualified accountants			0
that is the case in most countries in the world			0
@entity3 is actually being more open to non-qualified foreigners participating in their practices , " mr @entity39 said			2
nevertheless , the restructuring will pose a challenge for foreign firms			0
given how young the auditing industry is in @entity3 , they have few local employees who are ready to be senior partners			2
the restructuring announcement comes a few days after @entity71 officials said that @entity3 was considering a compromise on another contentious issue : joint @entity71 - @entity3 audit inspections			0
after the rash of accounting scandals at @entity3 firms , the @entity71 government had asked @entity30 to open its doors to the @entity71 body that oversees the auditors of publicly listed companies			1
@entity83 , chairman of the @entity71 @entity84 , said last week that @entity3 might agree to allow it to observe the audits of @entity3 companies listed in the @entity71			1
in a reminder of the concerns surrounding the @entity3 industry , the @entity87 said on wednesday that it was investigating a client of the @entity3 arm of @entity47 on suspicion of accounting fraud			2
the @entity87 also filed an administrative action against @entity47 for failing to provide audit documents related to the company -- something which @entity3 regulators have barred it from doing			0
