-- @entity1 , 13 , does n't like lions			1
in fact , he hates them			0
yet this bright @entity6 boy has devised an innovative solution that 's helping the survival of these magnificent beasts -- by keeping them away from humans			1
living on the edge of @entity13 , in @entity14 , @entity1 first became responsible for herding and safeguarding his family 's cattle when he was just nine			1
but often , his valuable livestock would be raided by the lions roaming the park 's sweet savannah grasses , leaving him to count the losses			2
" i grew up hating lions very much , " says @entity1 , who is from @entity22 , just south of the capital @entity24			1
" they used to come at night and feed on our cattle when we were sleeping			0
" read this : boy 's website tracks big beasts so , at the age of 11 , @entity1 decided it was time to find a way of protecting his family 's cows , goats and sheep from falling prey to hungry lions			1
his light bulb moment came with one small observation			0
" one day , when i was walking around , " he says , " i discovered that the lions were scared of the moving light			0
" @entity1 realized that lions were afraid of venturing near the farm 's stockade when someone was walking around with a flashlight			1
he put his young mind to work and a few weeks later he 'd come up with an innovative , simple and low - cost system to scare the predators away			2
he fitted a series of flashing led bulbs onto poles around the livestock enclosure , facing outward			0
the lights were wired to a box with switches and to an old car battery powered by a solar panel			0
they were designed to flicker on and off intermittently , thus tricking the lions into believing that someone was moving around carrying a flashlight			0
since @entity71 rigged up his " @entity72 , " his family has not lost any livestock to the wild beasts , to the great delight of his father and astonishment of his neighbors			1
read this : teaching lions and humans to get along what 's even more impressive is that @entity1 devised and installed the whole system by himself , without ever receiving any training in electronics or engineering			1
the 13 - year - old 's remarkable ingenuity has been recognized with an invitation to the @entity90 conference , being held this week in @entity91 , where he 'll share the stage with some of the world 's greatest thinkers , innovators and scientists			1
" i did it myself , no one taught me , i just came up with it , " says @entity1			2
" i had to look after my dad 's cows and make sure that they were safe			0
" human - wildlife conflict @entity24 is the world 's only capital with a national park , where wild lions , rhinos and other beasts roam free against the urban backdrop of skyscrapers rising from the nearby bustling city center			2
each year , thousands of camera - toting tourists visit the park -- which is fenced along its northern boundary but open in the south -- hoping to catch a glimpse of the lions inhabiting its rolling plains and valleys			0
read this : orphaned girl starts university at 14 but for the pastoralists and @entity6 tribes around the park , a lion sighting is usually bad news ; valuable livestock are often lost to lions looking for easy prey , prompting rural communities to take matters into their own hands			0
in some cases they 've killed whole prides that they perceived as threat , or as retaliation for lost livestock			0
the use of pesticides such as @entity144 -- a tablespoon of which costs less than a dollar and is enough to kill a lion -- has become a particularly ruthless way of doing so			0
the rising human - wildlife conflict , coupled with a fast - growing urban encroachment , means that @entity14 is now home to less than 2,000 lions , a massive drop compared to the 15,000 that lived there just a decade ago			1
large sums have been spent in recent years by officials in a bid to protect the lions and strengthen @entity14 's tourism industry			1
yet conservationists say that many of these top - down initiatives fail to gain traction with local populations			0
and this is why inventions like @entity71 's -- home grown , simple , affordable and effective -- can make a big difference			0
indeed , several neighbors of the @entity1 family in @entity22 have sought @entity1 's help , asking him to install the system in their enclosures			1
in total , around 75 " @entity175 " systems have so far been rigged up around @entity14			2
" this is a solution that was invented by somebody in the community , " explains @entity177 , executive director of the @entity178 and chairman of the @entity180			0
" therefore the support for it is very high			0
" bright ideas , bright future @entity177 and her colleagues first came across @entity1 's innovation some two years ago in the course of their fieldwork			1
stunned by the boy 's achievements , they helped him get a scholarship at @entity198 , one of @entity14 's top educational institutions , where he started last april			1
" @entity1 is quite an extraordinary boy , " says @entity177			1
she describes him as a " very smart , curious and surprisingly confident [ boy ] for his age and background , " who 's integrated smoothly among his new classmates , most of whom are from wealthy families			2
" one thing that 's unique about @entity1 is that if you give him a problem , he 'll keep working at it until he can fix it , " she adds			2
" he does n't give up ; he does n't find things too difficult ; he 's not afraid of being unable to do something and i think this is why he is such a good innovator -- because he 's not worried that it might not work , he 's going to try and do it anyway			0
" @entity1 says his dream is to work in aviation when he grows up			2
" three years ago when i was in the savannah herding my father 's cattle i used to see the planes flying over and landing at the airport and i was like , one day i 'll be a pilot and an aircraft engineer , " he says			1
for this remarkable boy , it 's clear that the sky is the limit .			2

@entity1 , 13 , has found an innovative way to protect his family 's cattle from lions
he created " @entity72 , " which keeps the predators away from the family 's enclosure
the @entity14 boy will speak about his invention at the @entity90 conference
