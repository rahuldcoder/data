@entity0 -- " @entity4 " , the first hotel planned in space , expects to open for business in 2012 and would allow guests to travel around the world in 80 minutes			1
an artist 's impression of the @entity4 , where guests would enjoy views of the @entity11 during their three - day stay its @entity0 - based architects say the space hotel will be the most expensive in the galaxy , costing $ 4 million for a three - day stay			1
during that time guests would see the sun rise 15 times a day and use @entity19 suits to crawl around their pod rooms by sticking themselves to the walls like @entity23			1
company director @entity24 says the three - bedroom boutique hotel 's joined - up pod structure , which makes it look like a model of molecules , was dictated by the fact that each pod room had to fit inside a rocket to be taken into space			1
" it 's the bathrooms in zero gravity that are the biggest challenge , " says @entity24			0
" how to accommodate the more intimate activities of the guests is not easy			2
" but they may have solved the issue of how to take a shower in weightlessness -- the guests will enter a spa room in which bubbles of water will float around			2
when guests are not admiring the view from their portholes they will take part in scientific experiments on space travel			2
@entity4 began as a hobby for former aerospace engineer @entity24 , until a space enthusiast decided to make the science fiction fantasy a reality by fronting most of the $ 3 billion needed to build the hotel			1
an @entity61 company intent on colonizing @entity62 , which sees @entity63 as a first step , has since come on board , and private investors from @entity67 , the @entity61 and the @entity68 are in talks			0
plenty rich enough if @entity24 is secretive about the identity of his generous backer , he is more forthcoming about the custom he can expect			0
" we have calculated that there are 40,000 people in the world who could afford to stay at the hotel			1
whether they will want to spend money on going into space , we just do n't know			0
" four million dollars might be a lot to spend on a holiday , but those in the nascent space tourism industry say hoteliers have been slow on the uptake because no one thought the cost of space travel would come down as quickly as it has			1
@entity4 said the price included not only three nights in space			1
guests also get eight weeks of intensive training at a @entity98 - style space camp on a tropical island			2
" there is fear associated with going into space , " said @entity24			0
" that 's why the shuttle rocket will remain fixed to the space hotel for the duration of the guests ' stay , so they know they can get home again			1
" in an era of concern over climate change , @entity112 has no plans so far to offset the pollution implications of sending a rocket to carry just six guests at a time into space			0
" but , " says @entity24 , " i 'm hopeful that the impact of seeing the earth from a distance will stimulate the guests ' urge to value and protect our planet			0
