-- @entity2 adjusts her iridescent blue goggles over her cherubic face , steps to the edge of the pool and dives in head first			2
the 7 - year - old is one of the lucky ones : her mother enrolled her in private swim lessons since the age of 3			1
many other young @entity14 are on lengthy wait lists as demand for public swimming lessons outstrips supply in a city that 's surrounded by coastline -- yet a majority of residents ca n't swim , according to local water safety experts			1
" it 's really hard to get placed , " says @entity24 , @entity2 's stay - at - home mother			0
" i 've got several friends who put their names in every year but they have n't been lucky			0
" " and even if they get admitted , the classes are usually at the hottest time of the year			0
public swimming pools are very crowded , " adds @entity30 , who send her daughter to @entity33			1
with an estimated 12,000 students across 21 pools , it 's @entity1 's largest private swimming institution			1
@entity1 holds a lottery , what it calls a ballot system , for government - subsidized swimming lessons			1
nearly 60,000 people applied for 47,000 swim spots in the most recent 2011 - 2012 year , according to the city 's @entity45			2
a one - hour session at @entity33 costs about $ 15 for one hour , comparable to the cost for dance or piano lessons in this city			2
but publicly - backed lessons are a bargain -- a series of 10 one - hour sessions runs just $ 12 dollars			2
@entity1 's failure to satisfy demand for public classes sets the stage for a private business opportunity			1
" i would say about 40 % of all parents who can not enroll in the government 's programs choose @entity33 , " says @entity61 , director of @entity33			0
" and even if you are lucky and you get a chance to participate in the government program , you 're not guaranteed to be allocated ( a spot ) in the next term			0
" a majority of @entity1 's citizens ca n't swim , says @entity30 , general secretary of the @entity1 @entity72			1
founded in 1968 , it 's the city 's oldest and largest such organization			0
" i feel shocked , " he says , " because @entity1 is surrounded by water and it 's a big city			1
" this @entity78 territory is made of more than 200 islands with 700 kilometers of coastline - more than the distance from @entity82 to @entity83 and double the distance from @entity85 to @entity86 @entity30 , a lifeguard of a dozen years is well - known in @entity1 's swim community and a vocal critic of the government			1
he estimates if the city 's entire population of 7 million residents were thrown in the sea " less than 20 % can survive "			2
@entity61 of @entity33 thinks it is more nuanced than that			0
he believes 20 % of @entity1 's elderly can swim while that number jumps to between 40 % and 50 % for the city 's youth			1
the @entity1 government does not conduct surveys on the number of citizens who can swim			1
regardless of numbers , @entity30 blames @entity1 society 's emphasis on academics			1
" most @entity78 , especially @entity14 , are not as focused on swimming or sports because they think it 's useless			1
but i think this is n't right because children have to learn more things			0
you have to teach them how to survive in the water			0
" i hope more parents can open their minds			0
" and the recent ferry collision - @entity1 's most fatal water disaster in four decades - still hangs fresh on many minds			1
on october 1 , amid fireworks for @entity78 's national day holiday celebrating the founding of the @entity127 , 39 people died when two ferries collided			2
more than 100 passengers had been thrown into the sea			0
watching the accident unfold , @entity2 's mother - who ca n't swim herself - had no doubt her daughter 's time in the pool is well spent			2
" since @entity2 can swim , she wo n't panic and can save herself			2
i think her odds of surviving a water - related accident are double			0
" the @entity1 government has since announced a nearly 7 % expansion of public swim classes			1
but the @entity141 's @entity30 is still critical			0
" i do n't think this is enough			0
even if they increase ( public classes by ) 700 % it is not enough for @entity1 's children			1
" so for now , parents like @entity24 will go where the supply is -- at private schools -- if they can afford it			0
those who can not will have to hope their names will finally be chosen next year			0
@entity0 's @entity153 and @entity154 contributed to this report .			0
