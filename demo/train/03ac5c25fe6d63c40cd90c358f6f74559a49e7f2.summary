-- the ubiquity of the " @entity2 " is staggering			1
more than 18 million copies have sold since the @entity4 -- when a @entity6 widow named @entity7 published her recipes and anecdotes in the hope of lifting @entity12 's spirits			1
and while the lemonade concoctions and tuna casserole recipes were delicious , the real secret of the cookbook 's success is n't that it soothed stomachs ; it 's that it catered to hearts and minds			1
the artist of life @entity7 's young life was uniquely charmed			2
she was born in 1877 to wealthy @entity25 immigrants and spent her teenage years shuttling between her hometown of @entity27 and the elegant port city of @entity29 , @entity25			2
after enjoying a brief tryst with novelist @entity31 , @entity7 settled down and married an attorney , with whom she raised two children			2
although never employed , she thought of herself as an " artist of life , " a renaissance woman who aspired to live vibrantly and suck the marrow out of every moment			2
when the stock market crashed in 1929 , @entity7 's spirit was put to the test			2
her husband , who 'd long suffered from depression , committed suicide			1
but instead of wallowing in grief , the 54 - year - old widow found meaning in a project -- writing a cookbook she titled " the @entity2 : a collection of reliable recipes with a @entity51			1
" once completed in 1931 , she spent half her savings to publish the book locally in @entity27			2
friends and acquaintances tested the recipes , and the feedback was encouraging , so she began pitching it to major publishers			1
five years later , in 1936 , @entity61 finally took a chance on it and agreed to distribute the " @entity2 " nationwide			1
the truth is that @entity7 had never been a great chef , but she was an excellent hostess			2
she could whip up a party at a moment 's notice and keep all of her guests entertained			2
by infusing the " @entity2 's " text with that same wit and conviviality , @entity7 set her cookbook apart			1
from the first page , she skipped the kitchen basics in favor of extolling the virtues of cocktails : " they loosen tongues and unbutton the reserves of the socially diffident			1
serve them by all means , preferably in the living room , and the sooner the better			1
" @entity7 's @entity25 heritage also deeply influenced early editions of the book			2
the first @entity87 includes recipes for dishes such as blitzkuchen and linzer tortes and even a few rousing quotes from @entity92			1
@entity7 also exhibited an endearing frankness with her readers			0
unlike any other cookbook narrator at the time , @entity7 admitted to her lack of expertise and joked about not having time to cook			0
in one section , she wrote , " the @entity25 recipe reads , ' stir for one hour , ' but of course , no high - gear @entity12 has time for that			0
" simply stated , @entity7 knew her audience			0
@entity0 : 10 foods that are aphrodisiacs @entity87 and depression other than maybe " @entity109 , " no book grasped the hardships of the @entity4 better than the " @entity2			1
" @entity7 understood that @entity12 housewives were struggling to put food on the table , and she addressed those challenges head on			1
many entries began with the tag " inexpensive and good			1
" there was even an appendix on making the most of leftovers , including stale bread , bones , coffee grounds , and pickle vinegar			0
along with these tidbits , @entity7 also included the food preferences of celebrities and monarchs			1
" is there anything better than good coffee cake ? " she wrote			1
" i am told that the former king of @entity133 ' dunks			0
' " these asides bore little culinary relevance , but they made readers believe they shared something in common with royalty and celebrities			0
follow this recipe , @entity7 hinted , and you 're making the same sponge cake that @entity143 once made for @entity144 when he was under the weather			0
as the country marched off to @entity147 , the " @entity2 " adapted to the times			1
@entity7 's 1943 edition was the first major cookbook to address the issue of rationing			1
once again , she treated cutbacks as opportunities for innovation , creating recipes such as @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159			1
she even gave soybeans top billing , featuring them as a prime substitute for meat			0
@entity0 : food challenges for the @entity166 family tradition by 1951 , @entity7 was in her seventies , so her daughter , @entity169 , took over the bulk of her work			1
in some ways , @entity169 was even more of a visionary than her mother , and many of her choices for the 1951 " @entity2 " helped transform it into the classic it is today			1
for example , to illustrate techniques and ingredients , @entity169 added 150 line drawings			0
she could have chosen trendy photographs , but her decision to use simple , helpful sketches ensured that the book would feel timeless			0
by contrast , the technicolor cakes and sweaty roast turkeys of 1950 's " @entity191 's @entity190 " now feel dated			0
@entity169 also introduced a simple lowercase font for the logo			0
at the time , this was an understated choice ; today , it 's an icon of cookery			0
like her mother , @entity169 also drew inspiration from the national mood			0
when the next edition of @entity87 was commissioned in 1963 , the carefree consumer atmosphere of postwar @entity12 was over			1
doctors no longer plugged cigarettes on tv , and books such as @entity207 's " @entity206 " dominated the shelves			0
to address growing consumer awareness , @entity169 cut some of @entity7 's digressions to make way for more relevant information			0
she included a massive section titled " know your ingredients , " containing charts , diagrams , and exhaustive explanations on everything from the best way to beat eggs to how yeast works			0
the goal was to help readers understand not just the hows of cooking , but the whys , as well			0
@entity169 also wanted @entity12 to eat healthier , so she added nutritional advice to the pages of @entity87			0
plagued by undiagnosed food allergies as a child , she understood the link between ingredients and wellness years before people started talking about " organic farming " and " health food			1
" although the book still contained plenty of recipes for condensed - soup casseroles , 1963 's @entity87 suggested using fresh , seasonal fruits and vegetables instead of canned or frozen produce			1
in an era of @entity247 , @entity169 pushed for whole grains			0
@entity169 produced her last revision in 1975 with the help of her husband , @entity252 , and son , @entity254			2
the work was a monumental tome , containing more than 4,500 recipes and 1,000 illustrations			2
thanks to its encyclopedic size , this edition became the resource not only for grandmothers searching for @entity25 chocolate cake recipes , but also for their hippie grandchildren looking for tips on granola			1
presciently , the book warned readers against overusing microwaves , which were embraced by most major cookbooks at the time			0
( off the record , @entity169 actually wrote to @entity274 that she believed microwaves were zapping the nutritional value from food			2
) the 1975 @entity87 was considered so authoritative that it remained in print for more than 20 years			0
@entity0 : secret menu items at fast food restaurants today 's tastes in 1997 , @entity282 hired a team of chefs to write a completely new @entity87 without any input from the @entity169 family			2
critics slammed the edition for being sterile and lacking any sense of playfulness			2
in 2006 , the publisher made amends			0
@entity293 and his wife , @entity294 , were put in charge of the 75th anniversary edition , creating a new version that combined @entity169 's conscientiousness with her mother 's sense of fun			1
instead of catering to weight - loss fads ( the authors thank heaven that low - carb diets are no longer in vogue ) , the latest @entity87 stresses moderation and balance			1
the classic , gut - busting @entity25 cakes are still there , but they share space with homemade energy bars			0
@entity169 would be proud that ethnic cooking is finally represented on a level that reflects our culture , with recipes for hummus , cream cheese balls , and salsa on neighboring pages			1
meanwhile , her mother would be happy that cocktails are back , along with old , quirky recipes , such as @entity324 for 100 people			1
and the tidbits are classically @entity7			0
for example : " the @entity327 , who were passionate about snails , grew them on ranches where they were fed special foods like bay leaves , wine , and spicy soups as pre-seasoning			0
" but to really grasp the spirit of the " @entity2 , " one needs only to look at the index of the latest edition , which begins with a @entity342 quote			1
it reads , " knowledge is of two kinds			0
we know a subject ourselves , or we know where we can find information on it			0
" @entity7 would be proud			0
