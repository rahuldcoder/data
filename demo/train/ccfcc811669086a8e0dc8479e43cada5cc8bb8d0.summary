-- this year 's flu vaccine was less effective than officials previously thought , particularly for the elderly , said officials with the @entity5			1
officials have said the worst may be over and flu cases are declining			1
the 2012 - 13 flu season began in december , much earlier than usual , and was more severe than last year 's			0
that particularly was true for those 65 or older , according to a @entity5 report thursday			1
the vaccine was 9 % effective in protecting people in that age group			1
" one possible explanation for this is that some older people did not mount an effective immune response to the @entity20 component of this season 's vaccine , " the report said			1
" however , it 's not possible to say that for sure			0
" an @entity20 flu strain has been the most dominant and has been especially hard on the elderly			0
among those over 65 , 146 per 100,000 were hospitalized for the flu virus , compared with a rate of 30 per 100,000 last year , the @entity5 said			1
dr. @entity30 , the @entity5 's director , said this month in a congressional hearing that about twice as many elderly people have been hospitalized with flu symptoms than in recent years			2
that includes the 2007 - 08 and 2003 - 04 seasons , which also saw a predominant @entity20 strain			0
" it seems that this year 's flu vaccine is not nearly as effective as we would like among people over the age of 65 for one particular strain of flu , " @entity30 said thursday			1
" that 's why early treatment is so important			0
" officials maintained , however , that those 65 and older should be vaccinated yearly , for reasons including that this population is at high risk of serious illness , hospitalization and death from the flu			2
" this flu season has been worse than average and particularly severe for the elderly , " @entity30 said			0
" although it 's far from perfect , flu vaccination is by far the best tool we have to protect from the flu			0
" authorities earlier had said the flu vaccine was 62 % effective for adults and children			1
in the thursday report , the @entity5 revised that to 56 %			1
the new number , the agency said , is " not significantly different " and continues to fall within the confidence interval established earlier			0
but the lower number includes an additional three weeks of data and was adjusted for various factors , including age and race or ethnicity			0
" both estimates indicate moderate vaccine effectiveness in preventing outpatient medical visits due to circulating flu viruses in most of the population , " the report said			2
in addition , while this year 's vaccine was considered a good match for the most common circulating flu viruses , it only provided 47 % protection against @entity20 , the main virus			2
" we simply need a better vaccine against influenza , one that works better and lasts longer , " @entity30 said			0
the @entity93 as well as the private sector are working on such a project , he said			0
in addition , less than half of school - age children -- the population mainly responsible for spreading the flu virus -- got the flu shot , experts said			2
the @entity5 recommends the vaccine for those 6 months of age and older			1
according to the latest numbers released friday by the @entity5 , " influenza activity remained elevated in the @entity106 , but decreased in most areas			1
" @entity0 's @entity109 contributed to this report .			0

the flu vaccine showed 9 % effectiveness among those 65 and older , @entity5 says
the vaccine was about 56 % effective in adults and children , it says
new numbers show flu cases are declining in most areas
