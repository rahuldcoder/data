four years after hosting the @entity3 , @entity2 's @entity1 legacy appears to be a lasting one			1
" beijingers are still steeped in the @entity1 spirit , " noted my daughter @entity5 , 21 , who is visiting @entity2 for the summer			1
she grew up here and saw the city host the sporting showpiece			1
as a 17 - year - old high school student , she took part in the olympic torch relay a few days before the @entity15 opened spectacularly in the @entity16 , an iconic structure fashioned after a bird 's nest			0
" the sports facilities seem a bit run down now but the space is still being used , " she reported after a recent trip to the @entity1 village			1
" @entity25 is now a tourist spot and holds sports and entertainment events			0
" @entity31 now has a water park open to the public for a fee , " she added , referring the @entity29 designed to look like a blue cube			0
@entity5 says the @entity35 are supportive of @entity36 , which will host the 2012 games this summer			1
" they have huge ads promoting the @entity40 , " she said			1
" they even have a double - decker bus inside the @entity31 and i saw many visitors take pictures beside it			0
" with the @entity15 just one month away , @entity35 watchers ask : what legacy did the @entity40 leave in @entity2 ? " the legacy is bad and good , " opined @entity47 , a senior adviser at communications firm @entity49 in @entity35 , and a long - time resident of @entity2			1
" the bad side is that @entity35 now has very expensive white elephant facilities to maintain with government money because they ca n't quite allow themselves to properly commercialize them			1
" the good side is individual participation in sports and it is now considered important to a healthy lifestyle			0
" @entity2 are proud to have pulled it off despite earlier skepticism and criticism			1
" it 's been generally positive , " said @entity65 , a 36 - year - old taxi driver			2
" infrastructure is much better , more tourists are coming and business remains good			0
" @entity35 has avoided a post-olympic slump , largely because of the scale , momentum and potential of its juggernaut economy			1
with or without the @entity3 , many observers agree @entity35 would have changed rapidly anyway			1
opinion : @entity35 has room to grow still , they credit the @entity40 as a catalyst of change			1
" the legacy left behind by the @entity40 is multifaceted , from hardware to software , " said @entity81 , director of the @entity83 , and one of the official spokespeople of the @entity3			1
she credits it for speeding up the modernization of the city 's infrastructure , from roads to telecoms , to subway lines			0
" in 2001 , when @entity2 won its bid to host , our subway network was only 60 kilometers long , " she explained			1
" in 2008 , it reached 200 km. at the end of 2011 , it has grown to 372 km. we plan to expand it to 660 km by 2015			0
" she also spoke proudly of @entity102 at the @entity103 , an ultramodern terminal shaped like a dragon			0
over the years , it has relieved the overloaded airport 's other two terminals			0
" @entity109 is now the world 's biggest stand - alone airport terminal , capable of holding 66 million passengers a year -- the third largest in the world , " @entity81 said			0
inbound tourism remains robust , thanks to the massive media exposure @entity35 got before and during the 17 - day jamboree			1
the @entity15 gave @entity35 a chance to use its cultural and historical legacy to attract people who would normally not travel to @entity35			1
who can forget the spectacular shows that film impressario @entity123 staged during the opening and closing ceremonies of the @entity15 ? @entity81 said the city 's " software " has improved too			0
" @entity131 's habits are changing , " she said			0
" more and more residents are learning @entity133			0
@entity2 has become more cosmopolitan , more international			2
the @entity40 has boosted our national pride and @entity35 's image overseas			1
" @entity137 , @entity139 's @entity138 president , agrees			0
" the world had a chance to see a different @entity35 from the one that is making the headline news , " he said			2
" i think it is fair to say the @entity15 allowed @entity35 to be perceived in a different frame			2
" the frames these days show @entity35 in a state of flux -- changing rapidly , prosperous and strong , but also facing intractable problems			1
" @entity149 helped @entity35 become more integrated into the world and with that comes different and higher expectations , like transparency , ensuring level playing fields and more , " added @entity137 , who has advised @entity35 and multinational clients during the @entity40			1
but @entity2 's modernization drive , hastened by the @entity40 , has come at a price			1
this includes the displacement of countless residents and the disappearance of the famed hutongs -- the city 's old streets and closely knit neighborhoods , many of which have been torn down to make way for new avenues and skyscrapers			0
photographer @entity172 , who has published a picture book on @entity2 hutongs , noted wryly : " when i photographed the hutongs in 1989 , @entity2 still had over 2,000 hutongs			2
now , there are only 200 honest - to - goodness hutongs left			0
" another price of rapid development is pollution			0
@entity35 air pollution : ' slightly polluted ' or ' hazardous ' ? @entity2 residents have become more aware of environment issues , but many " green " projects remain unfinished			1
the city has allocated billions of dollars to tackle environmental issues , hoping to cut back coal - burning pollution , prevent sandstorms through reforestation , and create a greener and cleaner @entity2			2
but four years after the @entity15 , @entity2 's pollution indexes are still hitting record highs			2
quite often , tourists drawn to the @entity25 find it shrouded by a thick film of grime			0
in 2007 , a year before the @entity15 , @entity35 also promised greater press freedom for foreign journalists covering @entity35 , saying they would be allowed to travel freely across most of the country and interview people with getting official approval			1
@entity35 has mostly lived up to that promise , but erratically			2
in recent months , foreign reporters have encountered a number of obstacles , especially in sensitive areas like the @entity207 protests anniversary , @entity208 and unrest in @entity210			0
@entity35 still routinely blocks internet access and locks up whistle - blowing journalists , bloggers and dissidents			2
for good or for ill , @entity2 is changing fast			2
its image now is light years away from the one i witnessed when i first arrived here 40 years ago			0
but for all its faults and imperfections , @entity2 remains a charming and dynamic city			2
is there any @entity3 - related goal that has not panned out ? i asked former @entity15 spokeswoman @entity81			0
" if you mean yet unfulfilled goals , " she replied , " it 's that our national football team has yet to meet the expectations of our citizens			0

*analyst* : @entity2 has many expensive white elephant facilities from 2008 @entity1
the summer games ' legacy has also been positive with more people playing sport
@entity241 : many @entity2 remain proud of having hosted the sporting showpiece
evidence of strong support in @entity35 for the @entity40 in @entity36
