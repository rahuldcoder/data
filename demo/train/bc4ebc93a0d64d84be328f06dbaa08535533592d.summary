@entity0 -- built on a temporary site and made entirely from recycled shipping containers , @entity0 's latest retail park lays claim to be the world 's first ever " pop - up " shopping mall			1
the aptly - named " @entity12 " opened for business today along a vacant strip of east @entity0 's fashionable @entity11			1
it is composed of 60 standard - size shipping containers , stacked two stories high and five rows wide			1
the park , which has taken a year to complete , is the brainchild of @entity20 entrepreneur @entity19 , who made his fortune in the 1990s with another box - themed venture -- the urban fashion label " @entity24			0
" " these containers have a strong symbolism for me , " says @entity19 , during an interview inside one of the site 's impressively refitted " shoebox " shops			1
" when i first started out selling clothes on a market stall , i dreamed of the day i 'd be shipping my wares off to @entity35 inside one of these , " he remarks			0
" now i think it 's fitting that something so closely associated with global trade has ended up itself as a shop			0
" but while @entity19 spends time enthusing about his love of the iconic sea cans ' " industrial aesthetic " -- he 's also keen to stress that the @entity44 , which has a temporary lease of five years , is more than just a hip new retail experience			1
" this is probably the most environmentally friendly shopping mall ever built , " he says			1
despite the fact that the park does not boast sophisticated insulating technology or even a small array of solar panels , the simple fact that it 's made from recycled materials adds credibility to @entity19 's claim			2
" when people talk about the energy efficiency of buildings , they tend to focus on operational carbon emissions			2
that is to say , how much energy the building consumes once it 's up and running , " says @entity63 , senior technical adviser at the @entity20 's @entity64			0
" but what often gets overlooked are the ' embodied ' carbon emissions -- all the carbon released into the atmosphere when the building materials were manufactured in the first place , " she adds			2
@entity63 illustrates her point by way of the @entity76 in @entity0 which , she says , saved 7,400 tons of embodied co2 by retaining and adapting the existing concrete structure of the site 's previous building			1
" this saving is equal to approximately 13 years of operational energy use , " she notes			0
according to a 2008 @entity20 government report on low - carbon construction , the manufacture of building materials for use in the @entity20 creates 45.2 million tons of @entity77 emissions a year , equal to roughly 7 % of the country 's total emissions			1
and carbon 's not the only thing to impact the environment when it comes to the sourcing and manufacture of building materials			2
" chopping down timber , polluting water streams , degrading the landscape by digging up mines ... all these things affect biodiversity and harm the environment , " says @entity63			0
" this is why it 's so important architects think about how they can use recycled materials during the design process			2
" back at the park , a frenzy of journalists are sampling tasters from rows of boutique eateries , coffee shops and a juice bar , each with colorfully decorated interiors that belie their miniature scale			0
" the great thing is , if one of these shops does n't feel it 's getting the most out of this location , they can potentially move to another part of the country with a vacant bit of land , without having to close down or dismantle a thing , " says @entity19			1
for him , the park represents a convenient alliance of economy and ecology , providing a cheap exciting retail space without extensive plundering of resources			0
" also , after five years , we 'll return the land back to its owners in exactly the same condition as we got it , and then the community can decide if it wants a more permanent retail space there , " he says			0
while the @entity44 may be the first " pop - up " shopping mall made from shipping containers , it 's certainly not the first building project to capitalize on their structural appeal			1
" there are about 400 established architectural projects making use of shipping containers around the world , " says @entity152 architect @entity151 , who has written two books on the subject and is curating an international exhibition on " container architecture " currently on display at the @entity158 in @entity159			1
" from @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 to @entity169 -- loads of big names have been turning shipping containers into shops or spaces that they think will enhance their brand image , " says @entity151			1
" i think in part because it is a universal symbol ... it 's also become increasingly cool			0
" the 31 - year - old architect believes that the containers have an inherently strong associated link with architecture			0
" they resemble building blocks , and when they 're stacked up along the port in little towers , it creates a neighborhood feel			0
" according to @entity151 , containers have been used for decades as makeshift residences and market shops in places like @entity193 , but it 's only in the last 10 years that architects have " added value " by creating high concept designs out of them			1
" in some ways i 'm surprised it 's taken the mainstream architectural community so long to utilize containers in this way -- as their modular , standardized shape lends itself so well for creating interesting buildings , " he says			2
@entity151 imagines that there will soon be more sustainable building materials available on the market and that this may ultimately diminish the popularity or need for his beloved containers			0
but at least for now , he says , " if you need a strong , relatively cheap , easily mobile structure , there 's few things better			0

@entity0 's " @entity44 " shopping mall has been built from 60 shipping containers
@entity221 's *founder* says mall offers sustainable *alternative* to conventional retail outlets
@entity227 's shops can *relocate* to another part of the country if business is slow
recycled containers save " embodied " carbon cost linked to construction of new buildings
