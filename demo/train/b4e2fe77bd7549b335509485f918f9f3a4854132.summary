-- it is widely recognized that the signing of the @entity3 in 1918 did not put an end to the drama that began in 1914			1
traditional geopolitical rivalries continued but now overlapped with competing ideologies of fascism and @entity9 to foster a climate of permanent war			1
that is why many observers at the time described the period 1914 - 1945 as a modern version of the @entity16			1
yet this second @entity16 soon gave way to the four decades - long @entity18			1
for a very brief moment the demise of the @entity18 appeared to bring to an end the conflicts unleashed on the battlefields in 1914			1
but this " @entity25 " moment was brief			2
today we are in the midst of a conflict originally designated as a " @entity29 " but which has been rebranded by the @entity31 government as the " @entity29 " and more recently as " @entity29			2
" the conflicts unleashed in 1914 were not confined to the military sphere			1
they were also a battle of ideas and a clash of cultures			1
the story that began in 1914 was influenced by a crisis of meaning that afflicted the political and cultural elites of western societies			1
a powerful mood of estrangement and disorientation dominated cultural life			2
in this moment of confusion even artists and intellectual sought meaning through fighting for a cause -- even a military one			2
some of the most enthusiastic supporters of the war were motivated by a disposition to react against what they took to be the soulless world of capitalist modernity			1
@entity62 , the renowned @entity63 novelist , playwright and well - known pacifist lived to see two world wars			1
when the @entity69 broke out in 1914 , he along with almost all @entity68 intellectuals , supported his nation 's war effort			1
later , with a hint of embarrassment he recalled the sense of excitement and celebration that the news of the impending conflict provoked among people			2
" and to be truthful , i must acknowledge that there was a majestic , rapturous , and even seductive something in this first outbreak of the people from which one could escape only with difficulty , " he recalled			0
@entity69 would be the last time that a significant body of intellectuals and artists would seek existential meaning on the battlefield			1
but conflicts over norms and values , which were crystallized through their quest for meaning continues to this day			0
indeed on hindsight it is evident that the @entity69 was a catalyst for eroding the prevailing system of meaning and helped intensify a clash of values			0
that is why the origins of what is currently described as the @entity102 can be situated at some time around august 1914			1
culture became politicized and geopolitical ambitions were framed through appeals to a " way of life			0
" today , very few respectable intellectuals would be caught waving the flag			0
instead of the flag , competing groups flaunt their identity and instead of celebrating their way of life they acclaim their lifestyle			0
with the demise of old ideologies the politicization of culture has acquired an increasingly unrestrained character			0
it is worth noting that most of the high - profile divisive issues -- family life , gay marriage , abortion , assisted suicide , multiculturalism -- express conflicts over cultural values			2
these symbolic struggles over the constitution of legitimate lifestyles continually exacerbate the fragmentation of social life			0
what 's more disturbing is that such struggles increasingly extend into global affairs			0
the current conflict between @entity140 and its @entity142 opponents is almost entirely conducted through the medium of culture			0
the denunciation of @entity146 as an authoritarian homophobe is self - consciously countered by the claim that @entity140 stands firm as the bastion of traditional values			2
like @entity146 , many @entity152 also take their stand on hallow grounds of tradition			0
@entity156 self - consciously reject the values of the communities where they grew up and embrace a call to arms for a war of cultures			1
@entity164 videos often communicate a simple message -- which is that the @entity166 provides quest for meaning			0
as i write , the war drums are again beating			2
@entity171 , the head of @entity173 , has declared the establishment of a new caliphate in the @entity176			0
his object is to abolish one legacy of @entity69 , the border between @entity180 and @entity181			0
there is still no end in sight to the @entity69 .			0

the period 1914 - 1945 was once described as a modern version of the @entity16
this second @entity16 gave way to four decades - long @entity18 , says @entity188
@entity190 : origins of " @entity102 " can be situated at some time around august 1914
