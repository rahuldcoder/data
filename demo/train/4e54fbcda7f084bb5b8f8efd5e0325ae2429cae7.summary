-- earlier this week , dr. @entity1 , host of the popular " the dr. @entity2 , " conceded that there 's no long - term miracle weight loss pill			1
this is despite his previous use of the word " miracle " to describe the weight loss effects of forskolin , raspberry ketones , sea buckthorn , garcinia cambogia , @entity16 mango seed and green coffee bean extract			1
dr. @entity1 said his job on the show " is to be a cheerleader for the audience ( when ) they do n't think they have hope " but hope is not the same as good advice , and , as dr. @entity1 noted , none of these recommendations have proven miraculous			1
" cheerleading " as described by @entity1 has contributed to the creation of a weight loss market that is overwhelmingly ineffective yet highly profitable , with sales at $ 60 billion per year			1
among @entity37 adults , 68 % are overweight or obese and as many as 100 million are trying to lose weight at any given time			1
annually , obesity accounts for about $ 200 billion , or about 20 % , of our health care costs			2
it costs billions more in worker absenteeism and lost productivity			0
over 80 % of people who lose 10 % or more of their weight will regain it , and for all the new treatments , that number has n't really improved in a generation			2
this is not to say that we should n't join dr. @entity1 in offering hope			1
we should seek hope by investing in new ideas and more personalized approaches to combating the obesity epidemic rather than by embracing anecdotal " miracles			0
" one way is to focus on obesity prevention , which starts in the home , school and community			1
numerous studies suggest that the behaviors we learn early in life influence our behavior as adults			0
( i know that my parents always told me to eat a vegetable with lunch and dinner			0
to this day , if i am running late for work and just have time to grab a hot dog , i feel a scowling avatar of my mother pop up on my left shoulder )			0
we can potentially delay or even prevent adult diseases by fostering better health habits in our children			0
schools are an excellent venue in which to orient families toward healthy behavior			0
teachers , in addition to providing health and physical education , can serve as role models and engage parents about good health practices for their children			1
unfortunately , most public schools , including those in @entity98 , do not meet their mandates for providing minimal physical education			1
and in general , there is n't enough focus on good dietary and exercise habits in school - based health initiatives			2
the need for a multipronged approach utilizing actions in communities , schools , businesses , families and health care providers to prevent obesity has been recognized by many federal programs ( such as @entity122 's @entity121 campaign ) , state programs ( such as @entity98 's ) , and local programs ( such as in @entity108 or @entity109 )			1
obesity prevention proposals have raised important questions regarding costs and long - term efficacy			1
it should be noted that some studies have shown that cost - effective , school - based interventions can be implemented , slow weight gain and yield other health benefits such as improved insulin sensitivity or cholesterol level in children			2
while it has not been determined whether these benefits persist after the program is stopped , the potential financial and health gains as a result of delaying the onset of obesity by even a few years would be huge			0
we need to start early at home , in classrooms , neighborhoods and even in the pediatrician 's office			2
the risk of a fat child becoming a fat adult is doubled at age 2 - 3 but over 20-fold after age 9			0
behavioral interventions appear more effective if started in early childhood			0
exploration of new preventive measures should require detailed assessment of their short - and long - term efficacy so they are adequately vetted before they become policy			1
we should demand that our schools emphasize life - prep as well as test - prep and that failure of schools to fulfill their physical education obligations is treated with the same severity as failing to meet academic obligations			1
school lunches should be a part of school education and we must actively oppose efforts to undermine them , such as recent @entity173 efforts to allow schools to opt out of requirements for more fruits and vegetables in meals -- an improvement that arose from the 2010 @entity179			2
health education is a learning process , and like any academic area , it needs to be developed over time			0
good nutrition and exercise habits are good for all of us -- fat or thin -- and most of us could use a refresher course			0
there is hope , but we have to use common sense and good science to make sure we 're on the right path			0
as @entity197 put it , " the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the more incredible do miracles become			0

@entity200 : dr. @entity1 says there 's no long - term miracle weight loss pill
@entity200 : 68 % of adults are overweight or obese ; @entity37 want to lose weight
he says obesity prevention starts in the home , school , community , and at early age
@entity200 : schools should provide strong health and physical education to students
