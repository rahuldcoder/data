@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 prime minister @entity3 described himself as a " penitent sinner " on wednesday after personally apologizing to a voter he described as a " bigoted woman			1
" @entity3 visited the home of @entity9 in @entity10 , northwestern @entity1 , after he was caught on microphone describing in blunt terms his encounter with the 65 - year - old widow whom he met on the election campaign trail			1
the @entity17 leader had had a discussion with @entity9 about the size of @entity4 's national debt , tax and immigration			1
@entity3 then got into his car and was driven away but he was still wearing a radio microphone , allowing broadcasters to pick up his conversation with an aide			1
" that was a disaster , " @entity3 said about the encounter seconds earlier			2
" should never have put me with that woman -- whose idea was that ? " he added : " she was just a sort of bigoted woman			2
" why @entity3 's gaffe could get worse the woman , @entity9 , told reporters she wanted an apology from @entity3 over his " very upsetting " comments			1
@entity3 later visited @entity9 at her home , emerging to tell reporters : " i am mortified by what has happened			1
i have given her my sincere apologies			0
i misunderstood what she said			0
she has accepted that there was a misunderstanding and she has accepted my apology			0
" if you like , i am a penitent sinner			1
" the encounter was immediately seized on by users of social networking sites , with opinions polarized between those who said it would damage @entity17 in the may 6 general election and those who believed it could help the party , currently trailing the opposition conservatives in opinion polls			2
one @entity62 user , @entity63 , said : " @entity3 has created a total survailance society			0
glad to see he got caught out , now he knows how we all feel			0
" another user , urbantaoist85 , said : " anyone else up for making all politicians wear a microphone at all times ? " @entity72 added : " i wonder if that was the final nail in the coffin for @entity17 this time			2
" @entity75 said : " i think @entity76 has just kissed goodbye to any chances @entity17 had left			0
" however @entity80 wrote : " i 'd be more concerned if @entity3 had said , " what that brilliant woman said about all those damn immigrants , too right ! " after his public apology , @entity3 telephoned @entity9 to apologize personally			1
the prime minister 's spokesman said : " @entity3 has apologized to mrs. @entity9 personally by phone			1
he does not think that she is bigoted			0
" he was letting off steam in the car after a difficult conversation			0
but this is exactly the sort of conversation that is important in an election campaign and which he will continue to have with voters			0
" asked about @entity3 's comments , @entity94 leader @entity94 , who has surged in the opinion polls following his appearance in the televised election debates with the other two leaders , told the @entity100 : " you should always try to answer the questions as best you can			1
" he added : " he has been recorded saying what he has said and will have to answer for that			0
" but one @entity62 user , @entity106 , spoke for many when she said : " i feel sorry for @entity3			2
if people i 've met knew half the things i 'd said about them when i left i would be stabbed and left for dead			0
