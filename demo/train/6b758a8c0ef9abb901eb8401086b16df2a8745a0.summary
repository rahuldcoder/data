@entity1 , @entity0 -- you might want to go green , but how do you know what you 're buying is truly ethical ? @entity5 -- the ignoble art of misleading consumers about a product 's true green worth -- is on the rise			1
but thanks to the work of increasingly vigilant regulators , some of the more curious and downright spurious claims are being weeded out			1
@entity21 's " six sins of greenwashing " include vagueness , irrelevance and outright fibbing			1
@entity21 , a @entity23 environmental marketing agency , has devised a guide for consumers which they hope goes some way to eradicating greenwash			1
they 've called it " the six sins of greenwashing			1
" @entity34 , president and ceo of @entity37 told @entity2 : " the regulatory initiatives in @entity23 , the @entity39 , @entity40 and , i suspect , @entity42 are rather impenetrable bureaucratic documents , and are not very useful to the average consumer			1
so we developed it as a tool that would be memorable and useful to consumers			1
" the sins include " vagueness " -- terms like 100 percent natural and earth - friendly which do n't really mean anything , " @entity55 " -- is a product truly sustainable ? and the " @entity59 " -- trying to make consumers feel green about products that have dubious environmental benefit			1
set up in 1995 as part of the @entity62 's program against greenwash , @entity37 examines the entire life cycle of a product and the science of environmental claims with a view to awarding @entity23 's environmental certification mark , the @entity70			1
" our position is to help genuine environmental leadership win market share , " @entity34 said			0
@entity21 is currently completing a 20 - year study of green marketing claims			1
they have discovered that greenwash is more prevalent when public interest in environmental issues is greater , and that there 's been a gradual increase in claims over time			2
" it 's a kind of a sawtooth curve , " @entity34 said			0
this rise appears to be a global phenomenon			0
the @entity87 @entity86 ( @entity86 ) says that complaints about environmental claims " increased dramatically " in 2007 -- 561 compared with just 117 the previous year			0
car manufacturer @entity90 ran into trouble in the @entity87 with its " high performance			0
the @entity86 ruled that " zero guilt " implied " little or no damage to the environment			0
" @entity99 was also found to have misled the public by claiming in a television ad that its green energy was " carbon zero			0
" the regulator agreed with complainants that the phrase implied that no carbon dioxide was produced			0
in their 2007 report the @entity86 concluded that ; " claims about carbon emissions and green tariffs were among those most likely to confuse consumers			2
" @entity40 is also clamping down on greenwash			2
in june 2008 , the @entity116 ( @entity116 ) demanded that tire manufacturer @entity117 compensate consumers after claiming that their @entity119 was eco-friendly and cut carbon emissions			2
the @entity116 -- which is also taking @entity121 car manufacturer @entity120 to court over inflated green claims -- has recorded a tenfold increase in complaints since october 2007			0
so does @entity34 think businesses are starting to get the message about greenwash ? " those sectors under particular scrutiny are educating themselves more quickly about what legitimate green marketing is , " he said			1
" in particular , cleaning formulations and cleaning chemistry			0
i think there is a great deal of movement towards greening generally			0
" but should products which are inherently bad for the environment be allowed to promote their improving green status ? well , @entity140 does n't think so			2
in october 2007 they banned all green references in automobile advertising			0
in @entity21 's " six sins " many motorized forms of transport would fall into the " @entity59 " category			2
@entity34 thinks that this is increasingly a problem area			2
" it has been suggested to us that some of the claims about fuel efficiency and carbon issues are fundamentally deceiving , " he said			0
inevitably , some products are going to fail the criteria needed to achieve an ecologo -- @entity34 once had to politely reject a bid wanting organic cigarettes certified -- but he says in most cases that @entity37 has studied there was not a malicious attempt to mislead			1
with such a barrage of eco-messages slapped on products these days even @entity34 concedes that " the six sins of greenwashing " might be too much for consumers to remember when out shopping			1
so , in a nutshell , what 's his advice ? " the most essential guide i can offer consumers is ; choose the product that appears to be doing its best to educate you , to offer you information and in precise language			1
" do you think greenwashing is a problem ? do we need more or less regulation ? have your say in the " sound off " box below .			0
