@entity0 , @entity1 -- the researcher dressed in blue plastic smock , slippers and gloves is having a tough time getting his work done			1
every time @entity9 sets up his camera on a tripod in an effort to document the behavior of one of the panda cubs scattered on a grassy hillside , one particularly frisky baby panda comes wobbling towards him , interrupting his shoot			2
" @entity20 ! " he yells in frustration , as the four - month old cub rears up on her hind legs , lunging towards him			0
he picks @entity20 up and deposits her at the opposite end of the enclosure			0
" i 'm not sure why she 's been all over me like this			0
i think she 's excited today , " @entity9 says			0
@entity20 is the oldest of fourteen baby pandas that were born last summer here at the @entity34 of @entity35 in @entity0 , @entity1			1
@entity1 's panda experts have improved the science of breeding and raising members of this endangered species in captivity			1
the proof of their success is in the baby panda enclosure , where visitors can watch as the newest generation of pandas takes turns napping , playing and exploring their outdoor habitat			1
the fuzzy young cubs are still shaky on their feet , and often trip and roll down the enclosure 's slight incline			0
while two cubs wrestle , another tries to climb a tree and then tumbles onto its back , slowly performing a backwards somersault , much to the amusement of onlookers			0
giant panda @entity63 likely miscarried " there are new breakthroughs , so that 's why the panda population has continued to increase , " said @entity65 , the chief zoo keeper at the @entity0 base			1
when @entity65 first began working at the base 12 years ago , he said there were only 20 pandas here			1
today , the center is responsible for more than 100 animals			1
@entity65 recently returned from the @entity75 , where he spent months assisting with the birth and care of twin cubs who were born there last july			0
" now we have new technologies that can very accurately identify when a panda is ovulating and do artificial insemination during a precise point in the [ reproductive ] cycle , " @entity65 explained			0
on its website , the @entity75 credited @entity65 and his colleagues in @entity0 with developing a technique using incubators and taking turns rotating twin cubs with the mother to better ensure the newborns ' chance of survival			1
" before when a panda had twins , the mother panda could only take care of one cub so we have resolved the issue of having twin pandas and helping them to integrate , " @entity65 said			1
the next big challenge facing @entity1 's panda keepers involves reintroducing captive animals back to the wild			1
" we have made a training base to return pandas to the wild , " @entity65 explained			2
" once they are mature and able to forage for food and hide from danger , then we will release some pandas			0
" @entity117 's panda cub is healthy , officials say wildlife conservation groups say @entity1 's effort to save the giant panda from extinction is a rare success story			1
according to the @entity124 , as of 1988 there were only around 1,000 pandas left living in the wild			2
in 2004 , that number was estimated to have grown to 1,600 wild pandas			2
more recent panda census statistics are not yet available			0
" the government put the resources [ into conservation ]			0
they 've actually set up some mountains just as a habitat for the panda , " said @entity133 , the chief representative in @entity1 for the conservation group @entity134			1
@entity1 has lavished resources on the conservation of the giant panda - rather than on some other indigenous endangered species - in large part because the animal is such an important national symbol			1
" they are a treasure for people in @entity1 , " @entity133 said			2
the breeding center in @entity0 is also something of a panda theme park			1
excerpts from the animated @entity155 film " @entity160 " play on a giant screen at the entrance to the facility , which receives more than a million visitors a year			0
inside , tourists travel in panda mobiles , decorated with the cartoon movie 's main character , @entity165			2
in addition to stuffed animal pandas , souvenir shops offer a variety of hats , ear muffs , and even fuzzy nunchucks decorated with the panda 's distinctive black - and - white panda patterns			1
visitors walk along paths , gazing and taking photos of pandas in large outdoor pens			0
the animals seem to completely ignore humans			0
in one pen , a 25 - year - old male named @entity183 lies on his back , gorging himself on bamboo which he holds in his front paw with the help of what trainers call the panda 's " pseudo-thumb			1
" other adults seem to spend much of their time fast asleep in their enclosures			0
but the big lumbering animals clearly have charisma			0
" they 're cute man ! " says @entity198 , a 21 - year - old university student from @entity199 who is studying @entity1 in @entity200			2
" they live a great lifestyle , play all day , eat , sleep			0
" what 's cuter than one baby panda ? @entity209 twins ! @entity2 's @entity210 contributed to this report .			2
