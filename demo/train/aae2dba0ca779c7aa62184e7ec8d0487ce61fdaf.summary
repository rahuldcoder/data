-- if the word " secretary " does n't conjure up an image for you , just run a quick @entity5			2
the pencil in the mouth is a recurring motif , as are beaming women in headsets seated in front of computers			0
images abound of women in low - cut blouses , legs crossed under tiny skirts , alongside head shots of @entity19 @entity20 and @entity21			0
the women of " @entity23 " hold their ground next to bondage shots of @entity26 from the movie " secretary			2
" given its cultural baggage , the term " secretary " has been jettisoned over the past three decades			1
it 's why we wo n't be celebrating @entity34 on april 25 , but rather , @entity35			2
retiring the term made way for the " administrator , " " assistant " and " support staff " of today			1
( it 's tucked away with the word " stewardess			2
" ) then why is it that billionaire @entity44 still has a secretary -- with a higher tax rate , as we heard over and over again this week -- and not an executive assistant ? also on @entity0 : ' secretary ' title is a blast from the past " it 's a generational difference			1
older people are used to the word secretary because that 's what everyone used to be , " said @entity53 , professor of linguistics at @entity55			1
" you can chalk it up to changing conventions and how words over time become associated with practices or habits that become out of date			0
" @entity44 is 81 , and became chairman and ceo of @entity71 in 1970 , just as the term was starting to fade			1
@entity53 has an assistant , but if she 'd had a helper 30 years ago , she probably would have called her a secretary , she said			2
@entity77 , @entity44 's longtime secretary , has never publicly questioned the title , and has garnered a bit of fame from her workplace in @entity82 , @entity83			1
she even attended the @entity84 as a guest of the @entity86 this year			0
" the word secretary , for many people , is associated with an earlier time when those jobs were held exclusively by women and women were limited to jobs like that , " @entity53 said			0
the @entity95 was founded in 1942 as a professional network for the growing number of women entering secretarial ranks during @entity100 there were limited job opportunities for women , and the title of secretary could have some cachet			1
but to be a secretary was still seen as women 's work over which the glass ceiling loomed large , spokesman @entity110 said			1
by 1998 , the organization had evolved into the @entity112 to encompass the growing variety of job titles and to recognize the advancing role of administrative support staff , said @entity110 , who , by the way , goes by the title communications specialist			1
" over time , being a secretary became increasingly more complex and secretaries were expected to master a range of very technical jobs			1
in many cases , they were the ones pushing for the adoption of electric typewriters and fax machines , and they were very often the ones integrating those kinds of technology into the office , " he said			0
" people who had those jobs increasingly felt the title frankly did not represent who they were as professionals , so you started to see the development of other job titles			1
" the shift was also about overcoming stigma , said @entity143 , author of " swimming in the @entity144 : a retro guide to making it in the @entity146			0
" " the term secretary really did not have much positive connotation by the mid- 1970s because so much cultural baggage had been attached to it by that time , " she said			1
what kind of baggage , exactly ? peril has a @entity156 board dedicated to the topic , and anyone who has seen an episode of " @entity23 " knows the markers : typists who take dictations and write memos but also serve as buxom eye candy and objects for an extramarital fling			0
it 's the kind of baggage that made secretaries the subjects of pulp novels with titles like " @entity173 " and " @entity174 " and the purported case study , " @entity176 and the secretary			1
" a more @entity179 - ish book series " private secretary " drew upon themes of small town girls looking for love in the big city			0
" not every secretary was a feminist , " @entity143 said , " but one of the things they realized from the feminist movement was they wanted to be treated with respect and one way to achieve that was to jettison the title ' secretary			1
' " that 's not to say the title is gone			1
by day , @entity143 is a legal secretary , and says she does n't mind the title			2
of the 22,000 members in the administrative professionals ' association , 15 % identified as secretaries in 2010 , up from 7 % in 2009 , @entity110 said			2
he has no real explanation for it , but speculates it might be driven by nostalgia			0
" i call it the ' @entity23 ' effect			0
i do n't have concrete evidence for that , but anecdotally , there 's evidence to suggest there may be a culture shift to use the title secretary			1
" perhaps a better question : does it matter ? not according to several secretaries we talked to			0
" i think everyone is on their toes about being politically correct			0
but i do n't think it matters , " said @entity220 , a 30 - year - old executive assistant at a commercial real estate company in @entity222			0
her responsibilities run the gamut from scheduling meetings to organizing conferences			0
as long as the paycheck clears , " it 's basically the same job with a different title			2
it means you have a job			0
