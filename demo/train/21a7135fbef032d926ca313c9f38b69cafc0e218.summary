-- @entity1 , the only @entity2 pow in @entity3 , has doubtless been at the forefront of his parents ' minds , if not atop the national conscience			2
it 's not that the @entity2 people do n't care ; it 's more that updates about the 27 - year - old soldier have been sparse , as his family has remained reticent for fear of jeopardizing his safety			2
with news that the @entity2 will engage in peace talks with the @entity20 and encouraging signs that @entity1 will be included in a prisoner swap , we 'll likely be hearing more about the man whom friends and family describe as an adventurer and a gentleman			1
the @entity2 expects prisoner exchange to be a topic of the talks , which are slated to take place " in the coming days , " in @entity31 , @entity32 , said @entity34 spokeswoman @entity33 during a thursday briefing			1
no decisions have been made about transferring any @entity20 detainees held at @entity38			2
any such decision would have to be made with congressional approval and in accordance with @entity2 law , she said			0
already , @entity1 's parents , @entity45 and @entity46 , have released a statement through a family spokesman , @entity49 col. @entity48 , saying they will speak to the crowd during a " @entity54 " rally in @entity52 , @entity53 , this weekend , though they 're not granting interviews			1
" the family is encouraged by the possibility			0
anytime that there are discussions and negotiations that may lead to the freeing of their son ... that is encouraging news , especially after not much encouraging news over the past four years , " @entity48 said , adding that the @entity58 have been talking with military and government agencies			1
" they know their son has not been forgotten			0
my brothers and sisters in uniform know we wo n't rest until @entity1 is safely back with his family			2
" those who know @entity1 say he 's gregarious and chivalrous , able to hold a conversation with anyone and prone to spontaneous acts of kindness			1
@entity80 , owner of @entity82 's @entity81 in @entity52 , where @entity1 once worked as a barista , recalled in a 2009 interview how she walked out to the parking lot after a storm and found all the snow scraped off of her car			1
" @entity1 would have been out there , " she said			2
" he would never say anything			0
" @entity2 pow 's dad to @entity20 : ' let there be peace ' @entity96 county sheriff @entity96 , now retired , said @entity1 did n't like automobiles and rode his bike back and forth to work , 15 to 20 miles each way , in any weather			1
@entity96 , who also rented @entity1 an apartment , once saw him walking , drenched , with his bike through a rainstorm			2
the sheriff offered him a ride			0
" he turned it down because he did n't want to get my car wet and he continued to walk in the rain , " @entity96 said			0
" kind of tells you a little bit about the person			0
" home - schooled as a youth and naturally curious , @entity1 enjoyed martial arts and fencing and was prone to wanderlust , friends and family say			1
he spent time in @entity118 before enlisting in the @entity49 and once worked on a sailboat out of @entity120 , @entity121 , that journeyed along the @entity122 and to the @entity123			0
@entity1 was 23 when he was captured june 30 , 2009 , after finishing a guard shift at a combat outpost in southeastern @entity127 province			1
military officials at the time said they believe low - level militants caught the soldier and handed him over to @entity134 warlord @entity133 's clan , which operates along the @entity3 - @entity137 border			0
initially , @entity20 commander @entity138 said @entity1 was safe , and a video was distributed showing @entity1 " in good shape and good health			1
" later , @entity138 issued threats that @entity1 would be killed if foreign troops continued targeting civilians during searches in @entity146 and @entity127 provinces			1
shortly after his capture , @entity1 appeared in a video , saying , " scared i wo n't be able to go home , and it 's very unnerving to be a prisoner			1
" since then , his captors have released three more videos of the @entity155 , @entity53 , native assigned to @entity157 , @entity158 , 4th @entity159 , @entity160 , in @entity161 , @entity121			0
the last video was sent in february 2011			0
the airborne infantryman , who has been promoted twice -- first from private first class to specialist , then to sergeant -- since his capture , has spoken in the videos on occasion , but analysts and those close to him say his statements appear scripted			0
such was the case when in december 2009 he appeared on a video saying the @entity2 had lost all hope of winning the @entity175 and that presidents @entity176 and @entity178 could n't be trusted			0
he also claimed @entity2 's military opponents in @entity3 were " very smart " and had " perfected " the art of warfare			0
earlier this month , the family said through another spokesman -- @entity184 of a @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity53 -- that they had received a letter from @entity1 via the @entity188			1
it was " scripted and redacted , " his father said , but he was in good condition			0
the statement added that the @entity20 was being careful with @entity1 and that there appears to be disagreement within the @entity20 about what to do with its lone @entity2 captive			1
" it appears at least several parties want to arbitrate captive @entity1 , several others ... want to keep fighting until every single @entity202 is out , " the father said			2
may 2012 marked the first time the @entity2 government acknowledged it was engaged in talks with the @entity20 to free @entity1			1
the discussions moved in fits and starts because of @entity2 concerns that any @entity20 prisoners swapped for @entity1 might be repatriated and allowed to rejoin the fight			1
in august , however , the @entity212 announced it was willing to send five @entity20 prisoners to @entity32 in exchange for @entity1			1
there have long been signs that the @entity20 is open to diplomacy			2
@entity218 , the @entity2 ambassador to @entity3 , told a @entity220 panel at his july 2012 confirmation hearing that @entity20 leaders are " signaling they are open to negotiations " but was quick to assert that the @entity20 must end its alliances with terrorist groups like @entity227			2
other officials have said they 're encouraged by signs that @entity20 representatives are doing just that and by statements suggesting the group is willing to accept ideas supported by @entity3 society , such as allowing girls to attend school			0
last year , a @entity20 representative also attended an international conference on @entity3 reconciliation in @entity239			0
@entity0 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 contributed to this report .			0

@entity34 says it expects @entity20 to discuss prisoner swap " in coming days "
@entity1 was 23 when captured in june 2009 in southeastern @entity127 province
@entity1 's family says via spokesman latest *developments* are " encouraging news "
friends , family describe him as gregarious gentleman , prone to wanderlust , kindness
