@entity0 -- @entity3 authorities say an investigation into a massive attack at a train station in the southwest @entity3 city of @entity8 has yielded a connection to @entity10 , a restive autonomous region in the nation 's northwest			1
at least 29 people have died and more than 130 were injured , local authorities say			0
witnesses described men clad in black outfits stabbing and attacking people with cleavers and knives			0
the local government officials told @entity22 , @entity3 's state - run news agency , that evidence at the crime scene indicate " it was orchestrated by @entity10 separatist forces			1
" no further explanation was given			0
in october , @entity3 authorities also indicated a @entity10 connection when a jeep plowed into crowds in @entity30 , killing five and injuring at least 40			1
that incident , which has been identified as a terrorist attack , was " carefully planned , organized and premeditated , " police had said on its official @entity35 account online			0
this latest incident brings focus back on @entity10 province			2
the region has a long history of friction between @entity41 , @entity3 's biggest and most dominant ethnic group , and the indigenous @entity43 , the ethnic group that comes from @entity10			1
who are the @entity43 ? the @entity43 are a predominantly @entity46 ethnic group who live in @entity10 , an area the size of @entity50 that is rich in natural resources , including oil			1
the province shares borders with @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			0
uyghurs , who speak a language related to @entity65 , regard themselves as culturally and ethnically close to central @entity66 , despite a long history of @entity3 rule			1
since the collapse of the @entity71 in 1912 , @entity10 , which means " new frontier " in @entity3 , has enjoyed varying levels of autonomy			1
in 1933 , rebels declared independence and created the short - lived @entity76 of @entity77			0
the @entity78 took over the territory in 1949 and in 1955 it was declared an autonomous region , giving it a status similar to that of @entity83 , which lies to the south of @entity10			1
why do @entity43 resent @entity3 rule ? over the decades , waves of @entity41 migrants arrived in the region , displacing uyghurs from their traditional lands and fueling tensions			1
@entity10 is now home to more than 8 million @entity41 , up from 220,000 in 1949 , and 10 million @entity43			1
the newcomers take most of the new jobs , and unemployment among @entity43 is high			2
they complain of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces , despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony			0
activists say that a campaign is being waged to weaken the @entity43 ' religious and cultural traditions and that the education system undermines use of the @entity107			2
why is @entity3 concerned about the @entity43 ? simmering tensions have erupted into riots			1
in july , 35 people were killed in a town about 155 miles ( 250 kilometers ) southeast of the provincial capital @entity113			0
state media said " knife - wielding mobs " attacked government buildings			0
the worst violence in decades took place in july 2009 , when rioting in @entity113 between @entity43 and @entity41 killed some 200 people and injured 1,700			1
that unrest was followed by a crackdown by security forces			0
@entity123 says @entity43 groups want to establish an independent state and , because of the @entity43 ' cultural ties to their neighbors , leaders fear that elements in places like @entity61 may back a separatist movement in @entity10			1
after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in @entity133 and @entity134 , some 22 @entity43 were rounded up in @entity61 and @entity60 and detained in @entity135			2
most have been released and cleared of wrongdoing			0
@entity3 has found it useful to blame ethnic tensions on outside interference , undermining sympathies at home for legitimate grievances , @entity137 , a researcher at @entity138 in @entity139 , told @entity1			2
in october , @entity3 arrested 139 people for spreading religious extremism online by posting videos of terrorist attacks or instructions on how to make bombs and other explosive devices			2
are there uyghur terrorist groups ? @entity123 exaggerates the threat from @entity157 groups , according to @entity158 , an associate professor at the @entity159 for @entity160 at @entity161			0
little of the violence that has occurred inside @entity10 should be considered terrorism , he said			2
" most of it looks like spontaneous civil unrest or isolated revenge violence carried out by individuals or small groups of local citizens , rather than by an organized militant group , " he told @entity1			0
however , @entity43 groups claimed responsibility for bus bombs in @entity174 and @entity175 prior to the @entity176 in 2008			0
the @entity3 government blamed an attempted hijacking of a flight in 2012 on @entity43			1
the @entity180 listed the @entity181 as a terrorist organization in 2002 in the wake of the september 11 attacks during a period of increased cooperation with @entity3 on security matters .			0

@entity3 's @entity10 autonomous region has a long history of friction
@entity43 speak a language related to @entity65 , have close ties to central @entity66
migration of @entity41 to the region has fueled tensions
tensions have *sporadically* erupted into violence
