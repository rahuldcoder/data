it 's no secret that more and more people are speaking espa√±ol in the @entity3 , but what you probably did n't know is that in the future more of those @entity7 speakers will not be @entity9			1
that 's right -- as immigrant families become more established here , future generations will follow the pattern of previous immigrants from @entity16 and @entity17 and stop using their native language			1
but at the same time , non-latinos will be learning @entity7 and helping their kids to grow up bilingual because they want to pass on what they learned in school , take advantage of business opportunities or even because they have a @entity7 - speaking spouse			1
" on the one hand , the number of @entity7 speakers is projected to grow to about 40 million by 2020 ( from 37 million in 2011			1
) this reflects @entity9 population growth and a large number of non-hispanics who will also speak @entity7 , " said @entity29 , director of @entity30 at the @entity31			1
" but , even though the number of @entity7 speakers is projected to grow , among @entity9 , the share that speak @entity7 is projected to fall from about 75 % now to 66 % in 2020 , " @entity29 said			1
in a previous study , @entity31 found that third - generation @entity9 are more likely than immigrant @entity9 to be @entity39 - dominant			1
they say they watch television mostly in @entity39 and the same was true about music and thinking			0
' @entity43 , would you please speak @entity39 ! ' in other words , third - generation @entity9 are not likely to speak @entity7 at home , if at all			1
they are growing up in a world where speaking @entity7 is not vital			1
which is exactly the case for @entity49 's two youngest daughters , @entity50 , 9 , and @entity51 , 5 , who live in @entity52			0
" when i had my first daughter , @entity56 , my mother helped me take care of her and only spoke to her in @entity7 so she 's fluent , " said the @entity54 - @entity3 mom			1
" but when i married my husband , who is white and only speaks @entity39 , teaching @entity50 and @entity60 just did n't happen , it did n't seem necessary , plus , they did n't spend as much time with my mother like @entity56 , " she said			0
@entity49 , who is a second - generation @entity3 , knows @entity7 but speaks @entity39 at work and at home			1
her husband , @entity66 , only speaks @entity39			0
her daughters are part of the phenomenon that people born in the @entity3 will make up more of the @entity9 population growth than new immigrants , with the rate of arrival of @entity7 - speakers slowing significantly in recent years			1
hispanics in the @entity3 it 's not just the attitude of parents that will affect who speaks @entity7 , but also schools , argues @entity83 assistant professor of linguistics @entity85			1
he said schools nationwide are set up to bring immigrant children and children of immigrants into " the mainstream , " which means turning them into monolingual @entity39 speakers			2
the attitude of most schools is that children will learn their heritage language at home and they cultivate identities that are rooted in speaking @entity39			0
there are few schools that offer compressive bilingual education programs , such as two - way immersion programs , where students receive half of their education in each language , and that can create a loss , @entity85 said			0
" language is just as much about value , culture , identity , context , emotion , behavior and usage			0
children learn in their school setting that the only language that really matters in this society is @entity39 , " @entity85 explained			0
" they therefore cultivate identities that are rooted in @entity39 speaking			0
" the changing face of @entity124 's youth @entity85 conducted research in @entity126 , where the @entity128 population has grown 394 % , from 76,726 in 1990 to 378,963 in 2000 , according to the census , making it the state with the fastest growing @entity128 population in the country			0
" in @entity126 right now , @entity7 is a ' new ' language where immigrant children experience shame for speaking @entity7 , and many children pretend not to speak or even understand the language , " said @entity85 , " this is not in the third generation , but in what we call generation 1.5 , the young children who come with their parents from abroad			1
" @entity85 said it is unlikely that these children will transmit @entity7 to their own children , adding to the trend already being seen among more established immigrants			2
he adds that unless politicians stop linking @entity7 to " the ghetto , " claiming that @entity150 do n't " assimilate , " arguing the national anthem should not be sung in @entity7 and that @entity39 is the " language of the future , " then @entity7 will not have a future in the @entity3			1
but speaking @entity7 appears to be thriving in new communities , with parents seeking out resources for their children to learn from			2
a guide to raising bilingual children @entity161 , author of " @entity162 is @entity163 " and co-founder of @entity165 , says many of her readers are @entity168 parents who want their children to grow up bilingual			0
" they are pushing for more dual language immersion schools where kids are immersed in @entity7 from day one , ensuring they become bilingual and biliterate			2
" and , it 's not only in children			0
non-latino professionals who work with @entity9 are also jumping on the spanish - language wagon			2
" i work in a high school where the majority of the kids are @entity9 ; it only makes sense for me to learn @entity7			2
i do n't need @entity182 ; i need to learn @entity7 , " said guidance counselor @entity183 at @entity184 in @entity185 , @entity52			2
" @entity7 is the second-most popular language in the country			2
it 's important that @entity190 learn it as well as their kids , " he said			0
@entity193 's parents are second - generation @entity182 but only spoke @entity39 at home			0
" and , with the way the country is changing , we will need @entity7 to communicate with newcomers , business if involved with @entity124 and even job opportunities			0
i know i want my kids to be multilingual , " he said			0
@entity85 , the language researcher , sums it up : " what is happening is simply a function of immigration , related as it is to the globalized economy , etc. " as a linguist , the big story is that @entity7 is being lost at the same time that new immigration continues to make the language a viable , visible and important language in the @entity3 " will @entity7 in the @entity3 thrive or decline ? share your thoughts in the comments .			1
