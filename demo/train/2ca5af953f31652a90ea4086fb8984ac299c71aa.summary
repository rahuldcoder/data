-- the writer @entity1 once described a poet as '' someone who stands outside in the rain , hoping to be struck by lightning			2
'' he could 've been talking about @entity6			1
when the @entity8 is n't inviting guys to meet her in the pouring rain , she 's courting danger any other way she can , just for the drama of it all			0
her new album is called " @entity24 " -- as in red light or red alert -- and it finds her singing about walking directly into traffic , wading into quicksand , and flirting with the kinds of jerks @entity23 might toast to			2
'' you look like bad news , '' she purrs on '' 22			1
'' '' i got ta have you			0
'' one gets the feeling that it 's not this guy 's love she 's after			1
she 's just using him for the breakup songs			0
this time around , it 's getting harder to feel sorry for @entity6			1
whether she 's plucking her mandolin , belting out @entity37 - inspired arena rock , or harmonizing with @entity38 of @entity39 or @entity40 , she never sounds happier than when she 's getting dumped hard enough to justify a good revenge anthem			1
the quotable @entity6 luckily , she 's recruited the world 's greatest boy - shaming pop team -- @entity45 , the @entity46 behind @entity47 's '' since @entity48 '' and @entity49 's '' so what , '' and his partner @entity51 -- to produce three of her best tell - offs yet			1
the smash '' @entity53 '' is such a sublime explosion of @entity57 glee , robots will still pillow - fight to it in 2035			1
and between the dubstep - lite chorus of '' @entity61 '' and gooey - sweet synths of '' 22 , '' @entity24 should be required listening at the @entity63 for girls , if such a thing existed			1
( in @entity6 's polka - dot world , it totally would			1
) '' 22 '' also shows how savvy @entity6 is about uniting guy haters of all ages			1
after enlisting her girlfriends to '' make fun of our exes , '' she invites them to dance '' like we 're 22			2
'' she is 22 , but this song belongs just as much to the preteens and power moms who pretend to be that age			2
at times , @entity6 sounds too eager to @entity81 - ify her own life			2
'' @entity83 '' seems to nod to her recent @entity85 wedding - crasher scandal ( '' we snuck into a yacht - club party / pretending to be a duchess and a prince '' )			0
and '' treacherous '' is nearly nc - 17			0
( when she sighs , '' i 'll do anything you say , if you say it with your hands , '' it 's safe to assume she 's not dating an @entity99 interpreter			0
) but the dishiest track is also one of the best			0
over plaintive acoustic strumming , '' @entity102 '' recalls a trip to meet an old boyfriend 's family ( @entity107 with the @entity108 , perhaps ? ) , and goes into heartbreaking detail about nights spent singing to the radio or flipping through photos of her ex as a '' little kid with glasses in a twin - size bed			0
'' she leaves her scarf at his sister 's place , and he keeps it long after they 've split , which makes you wonder			0
" @entity24 " might be about flirting with danger , but who 's risking more here : @entity6 , or the guy whose baby photos are now public domain ? for him , it 's not such a fair trade			1
he walks away with a scarf			0
and she gets the rights to the memory			0
