@entity0 -- seven years after upsetting favorite @entity2 to win the right to host the @entity4 , @entity0 is in the final straight of a long and often bumpy run - up to stage the sporting showpiece			1
as the city marks 100 days to go until the opening ceremony on wednesday , venues are on schedule and within budget , tickets are selling out as quickly as they become available and sponsorship revenue has exceeded expectation			1
" it 's a big day for us , 100 days to go , " said @entity16 , the head of the @entity0 organizing committee			1
" this is the moment when we really do start getting ready for celebrating and welcoming the world			0
" the @entity23 capital will become the first city to host the @entity4 three times in the modern era when the flame is lit on july 27			1
in 1948 , when @entity0 last staged the @entity29 in the wake of @entity31 , no new venues were built and athletes were put up in army camps or colleges and even asked to bring their own towels			1
although nowhere near the scale of those " @entity37 , " @entity4 has faced its own challenges amid the global financial crisis which began after it won the bid in 2005			1
still , an organizing committee led by two - time former @entity42 champion @entity16 remains hopeful of delivering the games within the £ 9.3 billion ( $ 14.8 billion ) budget -- albeit a budget that more than doubled from an initial estimate of £ 4 billion ( $ 6.5 billion )			2
the permanent venues , including the £ 468 million ( $ 746 million ) @entity48 , the @entity49 and the @entity50 , are complete , and test events are already under way			2
" i think the one thing i 'm confident in saying is that those things that are within our control are under control , " @entity16 said			0
" and we 're in shape to deal with those things that inevitably come at you that you do n't always see			0
" during the @entity64 's final visit to @entity0 last month , president @entity62 said : " @entity0 has raised the bar on how to deliver a lasting legacy			1
we can already see tangible results in the remarkable regeneration of east @entity0			1
this great historical city has created a legacy blueprint for future games hosts			2
" the regeneration of a rundown area of east @entity0 was one of the cornerstones of the city 's winning bid , yet its delivery has n't been problem - free			1
as recently as last week , six protesters were evicted from a patch of parkland where a temporary basketball practice facility will be constructed			0
they claim the land has protected status and is for the enjoyment of all ; @entity42 organizers insist they will return the land to its original state once the @entity29 are over			0
the athletes ' village has been sold in a joint deal to the investment arm of the @entity95 ruling family and a private @entity23 company , although 1,379 of the 2,818 homes will be set aside for affordable housing			0
a major question mark hangs over the future of the games ' centerpiece : the @entity48			2
the process has been fraught with problems			0
@entity106 @entity105 was originally awarded the venue , but that deal fell through after complaints from rival bidders			0
as it stands , @entity105 remains one of four parties interested in becoming tenants from 2014			0
a decision is expected next month			0
transport and security concerns the most immediate concerns for @entity0 surround transport and security			1
ask any @entity0 the worst thing about their city and they will almost certainly reply : getting around			1
the city 's aging subway system already barely copes with the daily demand			1
during the @entity4 , an additional 325,000 people are expected in the city each day			1
add in the regular strikes by underground workers that cripple the network -- another of which was called on monday -- and the potential for chaos only increases			0
@entity0 businesses are being advised to encourage staff to work from home if possible , change their working hours , or use different travel routes			1
athletes , officials and @entity143 should n't be affected			0
they will have access to special road lanes to get them to the venues with the minimum of fuss			2
that plan has n't met with universal approval though , with critics insisting it will leave the rest of the roads gridlocked			0
security issues were brought into sharp focus by an incident at the recent @entity159 - @entity158 when a protester managed to swim across the @entity161 and bring a temporary halt to one of the @entity23 's oldest sporting events			1
last year 's riots are also still fresh in the memory			2
while preventing every breach may be impossible , @entity0 has a security budget of £ 553 million ( $ 881 million ) dedicated to minimize the risks , which includes the deployment of 35,000 security guards and police at the games venues			1
there are , however , concerns that budget could increase			2
protest fears even before the @entity29 begin , there are fears that the 70 - day torch relay beginning may 19 could be targeted by protesters			0
a group known as " @entity183 " this week unveiled plans to target three major @entity42 sponsors -- @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 -- who the activists accuse of human rights or environmental abuses			2
the group is led by @entity193 , who resigned from the @entity4 sustainability watchdog after @entity186 , which has links to a deadly gas leak at the @entity198 plant in @entity199 in 1984 , was announced as sponsor of the proposed " wrap " around the @entity48			1
" we live in a democracy but we always balance protest with the rights of other people as well , " @entity16 said tuesday			0
" we have to remember that one man 's protest is the destruction of somebody else 's dream			2
i 'm sure we will get this in balance			0
" but the start of the torch relay is also expected to finally spark enthusiasm among a characteristically cynical @entity23 public			0
a recent survey by a foreign exchange company suggested a quarter of those @entity23 traveling abroad this summer are doing so specifically to avoid the @entity4			2
as they leave , more than 10,000 athletes from 204 countries will arrive , and the tantalizing prospect of international stars such as @entity225 and @entity226 competing alongside @entity23 hopes like @entity228 and @entity229 should go some way to appeasing those @entity23 who choose to stay behind			0
" there is an unprecedented appetite among elite - level competitors around the world to get to @entity0 , that 's the one thing i 've learned , " @entity16 said			1
" on top of domestic engagement , i do n't think any @entity29 has ever had that level of excitement			0

wednesday marks 100 days to go until the opening ceremony of the @entity4
@entity0 will become the first city to host the @entity4 three times in the modern era
venues are on schedule and within budget ; tickets sales have been strong
@entity0 's aging transport system and security are two of the major issues remaining
