-- @entity1 stands on the brink of tennis history after romping into her first @entity5 final on thursday			1
the second seed 's straight - sets win over @entity9 champion @entity8 not only ensured she will reclaim the world no. 1 ranking for the first time in four years , but also gave her the chance to become just the 10th female player to complete a career grand slam			1
standing in the @entity17 's way of emulating the likes of greats such as @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 is the 2012 tournament 's surprise package , @entity27			2
ranked 23rd in the world , @entity27 continued her dream run by beating 2010 @entity5 runner - up and reigning @entity32 champion @entity31 in thursday 's opening semifinal			1
it means @entity35 will be represented for the third year in a row , after @entity37 lifted her first and only grand slam title on the @entity40 clay in 2010 and then lost to @entity41 12 months ago			1
@entity1 reached saturday 's title match with a ruthless 6 - 3 6 - 3 win over @entity45 fourth seed @entity8 , going some way to erasing memories of her defeat in last year 's @entity9 final			1
the 25 - year - old last won a grand slam title at the @entity52 , before serious shoulder injuries forced her into a long rehab			2
she made the @entity40 semis for the second time last year , and has already reached one major final this year			2
defeat to @entity57 in @entity58 in january cost her the no. 1 ranking , but on monday she will rise above the @entity60 no matter what happens in her first career clash with @entity27			1
" it 's an amazing feeling to be in my first final			0
i have been in two semifinals but it was always my dream of getting to the final stage , " said @entity1 , who won @entity9 as a 17 - year - old in 2004 and then the @entity32 in 2006			2
" that 's pretty special			0
after my shoulder surgery , my ranking was out of the top 100 , but i thought if i could be number one in the world before that then i could do it again			0
" @entity27 had lost all five previous meetings with @entity31 , but she continued the form that saw her beat world no. 10 @entity80 and former @entity5 champions @entity82 and @entity84 in earlier rounds			1
" i did n't think i could do this coming into the tournament			0
this is just incredible for me , " said @entity27 , who will become only the third woman from @entity35 to ever rank in the top 10 after @entity37 and @entity89			2
" the first round here was difficult , this match was difficult , all the matches have been difficult , and i 'm very happy how i 've played			0
" the most important thing for me is i 'm just thinking about playing -- i 'm just playing my game without thinking of what i 'm doing			0
but i 'm not finished			0
" sixth seed @entity31 had been seeking to become the first @entity100 woman since @entity101 in 1973 to win the tournament			0
meanwhile , @entity103 and @entity104 won their second grand slam mixed doubles title together after beating @entity109 's @entity108 and @entity111 's @entity110 7 - 6 ( 7 - 3 ) 6 - 1 in the final			1
the @entity114 duo also won the @entity115 in 2009 , while the 38 - year - old @entity103 is one of the most successful doubles players ever with 12 titles overall .			0
