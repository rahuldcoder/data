-- despite facing a punishing air bombing campaign , the @entity1 in @entity2 and @entity3 continues to march across @entity3			1
this week , it tightened its siege on the @entity3 @entity8 town of @entity9			1
though it is too soon to write off the @entity13 strategy to " degrade and ultimately destroy " isis by relying on air power and @entity3 rebels , the opening week was a box office flop			1
for the operation to be a success , @entity18 should enlist the support of a group it has spurned : the @entity24			1
to explain : @entity14 is the most powerful fighting force across northern and eastern @entity3			1
its main @entity27 competitors have all been weakened in recent months			1
the @entity29 brigade @entity30 has seen its stock plummet after @entity32 curtailed its funding and its leader died			0
@entity14 chased the @entity36 affiliate @entity35 out of its eastern strongholds of @entity38			1
and the @entity39 has been adrift ever since the death of its leader last year			0
but @entity18 is not pinning its hopes on these politically unsavory groups to dislodge @entity14			1
instead , it has armed smaller and less powerful brigades from the loose umbrella organization known as the @entity46 and has announced a program to train 5,000 rebels in @entity49 and @entity50			1
equipping the @entity46 got off to a rocky start			1
sources in @entity53 told me this summer that one brigade tried selling @entity13 - supplied @entity57 anti-tank missiles to @entity35 for $ 25,000 this year			0
throwing money , arms and training at @entity46 units will not defeat @entity14			1
instead , it will require a fundamental shift in the @entity46 's thinking			1
one of @entity14 ' chief strengths is its unit cohesion			2
its cadres are ideologically bound , fighting for the cause of @entity68			0
these doctrinal bonds ensure that units stick together when they come under fire			0
in contrast , @entity46 brigades often battle for material gain and social status			2
in combat , their forces frequently disintegrate , no longer acting as a team			0
i witnessed this myself while spending time with them on the front in 2012 and 2013			0
there are also more mundane challenges			0
there are no rebel outfits that can confront @entity14 in its @entity3 bastion of @entity89			1
in the summer of 2013 , the city 's strongest @entity46 contingent , a loose alliance known as the @entity93 , mostly folded into @entity35			1
when fighting erupted between @entity14 and other organizations at the end of 2013 , @entity14 ejected @entity30 from the town			2
today , it reigns supreme in @entity89			0
to lay siege to the city , @entity46 groups would have to travel approximately 100 miles from their northwestern strongholds in @entity102 and @entity103			2
logistical constraints -- these brigades rarely fight beyond their home regions -- would make resupplying forward units with ammunition , food and fuel unfeasible			0
and if @entity18 is hoping for a civilian uprising to topple @entity14 in @entity89 , it might have to wait until the @entity114 jihadists are predicting will occur in @entity3			1
the @entity116 media have depicted @entity14 - controlled areas as slave markets where a terrorized civilian population lives in constant fear			2
but there 's evidence that many do not harbor such trepidation			0
raqqans i spoke to via @entity127 and in @entity53 said that many in the city support @entity14			2
and why would @entity3 acquiesce to a group that seeks to control most facets of their lives ? because , as president @entity135 famously quipped , " it 's the economy , stupid			1
" in a war - torn country where civilians wait in line for hours to get bread , where they endure constant power outages and are hard - pressed to obtain fuel , @entity125 live on a paradise island of commodities			0
@entity14 ' oil fields provide gas , its dams deliver electricity , and its efficient bureaucracy ensures that groceries are stocked with sufficient supplies of basic staples			2
president @entity154 may believe that @entity14 " is certainly not a state , " but the @entity3 under its control are grateful for its state services			1
most important , the group ensures security in a country where there is none			0
the chaos and plunder that characterize @entity46 - controlled areas are a distant nightmare			2
while the partially rebel - controlled city of @entity102 could be a stage set for a " @entity172 " sequel , @entity14 ' @entity89 is a field of dreams			2
the only other rebel - held areas that have a modicum of order are those under the control of the @entity179 ( @entity179 )			0
the group rules the northern city of @entity182 and the villages surrounding it			0
unlike @entity102 , the economy has not collapsed , and residents do not cut down trees for warmth			0
and in contrast to @entity89 , the secular @entity24 have not driven out @entity182 's @entity189 but instead have protected them			1
moreover , @entity53 fears that a @entity8 enclave would provide a safe haven for @entity193 from the @entity194 ( @entity194 ) have proved unfounded			0
the @entity179 has ensured calm on the border , and a grateful @entity53 government has reciprocated by meeting with its leaders			0
but the @entity179 's greatest asset is its willingness to fight @entity14			1
long before @entity46 brigades were willing to take on the jihadists , the @entity179 made the battle against them its chief objective			2
and while @entity46 groups receiving arms from @entity18 , such as the @entity208 and the @entity209 , have condemned the @entity13 airstrikes , the @entity179 has welcomed them			1
yet despite this alignment of interests , @entity18 has shunned the group			0
it refuses to recognize the @entity179 or support it , because of its ties to the @entity194 , a @entity215 - designated terrorist organization since 1997			0
in a country where @entity13 has so few allies , a change in policy is warranted			0
relying on insignificant @entity46 units will not be enough to topple the @entity14 behemoth			1
working with the @entity179 could help @entity18 reach its objective of destroying the organization .			0

@entity225 : as airstrikes against @entity14 fail , @entity18 should look to @entity24
@entity14 is strongest force in northern , eastern @entity3 , he says ; @entity27 rivals are weakened
he says @entity24 eager to fight , can supply the kind of order @entity14 brings to *conquered* cities
@entity237 : do *n't* rely on @entity46 ; @entity24 ' objectives more in line with @entity18 's
