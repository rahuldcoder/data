-- is a star player more important than team unity ? @entity4 's cricketers will find out the answer to that question over the next five days as they battle to retain the no. 1 test ranking without key batsman @entity8			1
@entity8 , one of the most flamboyant and controversial players in the game , has been dropped for the showdown with @entity12 -- the country of his birth -- after falling out with his teammates			1
@entity4 's preparations for the third and final test of the series , which they must win to stop the @entity20 taking top spot , have been dominated by a scandal over derogatory text messages , an ill - advised @entity25 video and a parody @entity27 account			1
all of which involved @entity8 in some form			2
the 32 - year - old issued an apology on wednesday for sending text messages to the @entity34 players during the drawn second test which apparently criticized @entity4 captain @entity36 -- who celebrates his 100th appearance in the five - day game at @entity39 's this week			1
but it was too late to stop him being thrown out of the squad and now seemingly unlikely to be named on saturday in @entity4 's team for the @entity44 in @entity45 starting next month			2
" i did send what you might call provocative texts to my close friends in the @entity34 team , " said @entity8			2
" the texts were meant as banter between close friends			0
i need to rein myself in sometimes			0
i apologize to @entity53 and the team for the inappropriate remarks at the press conference and for the texts			0
i truly did n't mean to cause upset or tension particularly with important games at stake			0
" the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) , however , has refused to say whether @entity8 will ever play for @entity4 again			1
" we are in receipt of @entity8 's apology , but further discussions need to take place to establish whether it is possible to regain the trust and mutual respect required to ensure all parties are able to focus on playing cricket and to maintain the unity of purpose that has served us so well in recent years , " said @entity61 managing director @entity62			1
" critically , those discussions should take place behind closed doors , rather than in the media spotlight			0
" a successful conclusion to this process is in everyone 's best interests and is required for @entity8 's potential selection in all forms of the game to be considered			0
" the @entity12 series presents @entity4 's biggest challenge since regaining the number one ranking last year			1
@entity36 ' side lost the first test and drew the second , with @entity8 scoring a defiant 149 before making an unexpected statement at the press conference casting doubt over his international future			0
" it 's tough for me in this dressing room , " he said rumors of " provocative " text messages sent to some of the @entity34 players increased the pressure on @entity8			1
the @entity34 camp , however , dismissed the texts and claimed that the @entity61 had n't even asked them to see the messages before they dropped @entity8			1
" text messages were sent , but it was banter , " said team manager @entity106			1
" the @entity61 has not made a formal approach to see the text messages as is currently being reported in the media			1
" @entity8 has always been a controversial figure , with @entity4 's management tolerating him due to his undeniable talent			1
he is one of a handful of @entity4 players to play in the lucrative @entity117 -- where he plays alongside several of the @entity34 players -- and earlier this year retired from the national team 's one - day and twenty 20 teams , apparently so he could play more limited - overs cricket in @entity121 and @entity122			1
in a remarkable turn of events on saturday , @entity8 released a @entity25 video in which he reversed his retirement , committed himself to @entity128 cricket and attempted to explain some of the recent controversy			2
crucially , he failed to apologize for the text messages			2
" i 've had a change of heart because i love playing cricket for @entity4 , i love being part of a successful @entity4 team , " said @entity8			1
" it would be sad for me to finish with the way things have been running through the media in the last three or four days -- it would be sad to end my career like this			0
" so sitting down with my family , my advisers , my close friends , we 've decided and i 've decided it would be a lot better to finish my career on a positive note rather than one that 's being developed at the moment			0
" the video did n't go far enough for the @entity61 , who instead called up promising youngster @entity154			0
@entity8 is a regular on microblogging site @entity27 , but was said to be furious when a parody account was set up -- called " @entity157 " -- and it was followed by several senior @entity4 players			2
the were suggestions that one of @entity8 's colleagues was responsible for the account , which had joked that @entity8 was motivated solely by money and thought he was better than the rest of the @entity4 squad			2
eventually , a man called @entity167 , who describes himself as " an @entity4 cricket fan , " admitted he set up the account			2
to further complicate matters @entity171 , captain of @entity4 's @entity174 side , is friends with @entity167			0
the @entity61 was forced to put out a statement on @entity171 's behalf on tuesday , less than 36 hours before the crucial test got under way , denying any involvement with the account			0
" following the statement by mr. @entity167 that he was responsible for creating a parody @entity27 account in @entity8 's name , i would like to confirm that i had no involvement in this whatsoever , " said @entity171			0
" i met with the managing director of @entity4 cricket , @entity62 , and assured him that i did not play any role in the creation of this account or provide mr. @entity167 with any information regarding @entity8 or the @entity4 team			1
" as has been widely reported mr. @entity167 is a friend of mine , but we had no conversations regarding this issue at all and i am pleased that he has now decided to close the parody account down			0
" @entity12 captain @entity201 described the situation as " amazing , " and claimed that in the visitors ' dressing room the matter has " hardly been discussed			0
" " from our perspective it 's just been so overboard really			0
i ca n't believe it 's still carrying on , " he said			0
@entity201 , who is due to captain his country for a record - breaking 94th time at @entity213 , described @entity8 as " world class , and warned @entity4 that it would be " wrong " to say " they 're not going to miss him			1

@entity4 and @entity12 are the top two ranked sides in world cricket
@entity4 need to win to maintain their number one ranking
@entity8 has been dropped after " provocative " text messages sent to *opposition*
@entity8 has apologized , but is yet to discover if he will play again
