-- call it part tank , part boat and part beer cooler			0
but it 's unquestionably all cool			0
it 's a new @entity7 vehicle for getting stuff like troops , tanks and trucks from ships to shore and back			1
the @entity7 showed off a prototype of its @entity15 - lift @entity16 ( @entity17 ) last week during @entity19 exercises in @entity20 , running it from the @entity22 's amphibious dock landing ship @entity23 to the beaches of @entity25 on @entity26			1
" showcasing the @entity17 during @entity19 is a big deal , " @entity27 of the @entity28 , which developed the @entity17 with funding from the @entity30 , said in a press release			0
" this is a great way to let people know that this new technology is being developed			0
" here 's how the @entity17 works : the tracks , which are made of what the @entity7 call " captured - air foam blocks , " extend like flippers to propel the craft through the water			1
when it hits the beach , the foam flattens to become like the tracks on a tank or a bulldozer , only much softer , according to a report from @entity48			1
last week , the @entity17 prototype , which is about half the size of envisioned production models , carried an assault vehicle from the @entity23 to the beach			1
the @entity7 says a full - size @entity17 would be able to carry much more			1
" the full - scale model should be able to carry at least three tanks and a @entity58 ( @entity58 ) , " gunnery sgt. @entity55 , the @entity28 's @entity56 officer , said in a statement			1
that 's about three times the load that the @entity7 ' current craft assigned to the task , called a @entity63 ( @entity63 ) , can handle			0
it also will be able to surmount bigger obstacles			0
while an @entity63 can only get over a 4 - foot - high sea wall , a full - size @entity17 will be able to get over sea walls as high as 10 , 12 or even 16 feet , according to the @entity7			1
the @entity17 prototype type is not armored or armed , but @entity55 said production models would have armor plating and a .50 - caliber machine guns for protection			2
they also would be much faster			0
the prototype could only go 5 mph on the water , but a full - size @entity17 should do 25 mph , gen. @entity74 , commander of the @entity75 , told @entity48			2
the @entity17 prototype used last week is the third in the program , built upon a concept originally proposed by the @entity20 - based shipbuilding and research firm @entity83 " there has been a one - fifth scale model , then a one - quarter scale model and this is a half - scale model , so we have been progressing , " @entity84 , program officer at the @entity30 , said in a statement			2
" every vehicle has incorporated more features and technology to help get us to the full scale			2
" there 's no word yet on when the full - scale model may actually come , but officials were happy with last week 's demonstration			2
" this is a great way to show what it can do , " said @entity27			0
" today went quite well			0
