" and teenagers and adults were fighting for these games , taking them away from little kids and away from my father			0
" the grandson , @entity32 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity33 that @entity7 had grabbed one video game and put it under his shirt so that others jostling for the game did n't take it from him			1
one person alerted a police officer , who then approached @entity7			1
@entity40 , a @entity41 from @entity42 , was among those shopping for video games set up in the @entity4 's grocery section in a mass of people			1
he said @entity7 " was not resisting " arrest as he was led away from the crowd by a police officer			1
the officer , @entity40 said , then suddenly hooked the suspect around the leg , grabbed him and " slammed him face first into the ground			2
" " it was like a bowling ball hitting the ground , that 's how bad it was , " he said			1
that was around when @entity22 said she heard of the altercation from across the store and ran toward her father			0
" i was fuming , " she recalled upon seeing her father on the floor			2
" they would n't let me near him at all , they were telling me to stay back			0
" video , recorded by @entity40 and later posted on @entity0 's @entity67 , shows an apparently unconscious @entity7 head - down on the floor in a pool of blood			1
as he 's turned over , @entity20 police officers appear to attempt to revive him -- at which point his face , covered mostly in blood , is revealed			2
several voices , apparently those of fellow shoppers , are heard saying , " why would you throw him down so hard ? all he did was shoplifting and you threw him down like that ? " another person says , " they threw him down			1
he was n't doing anything wrong			0
" two citizens then appear to come to @entity7 's aid by applying paper towels to the man 's nose			1
@entity40 estimated that @entity7 was knocked out for about 10 minutes , all the while gushing blood and handcuffed			1
@entity4 spokeswoman @entity92 said the retail giant was aware of the incident			1
" we are concerned whenever there is an incident involving a customer at one of our stores , " @entity95 said			0
" we are in contact with the local police and are sharing any information we have with them			0
" members of the @entity107 did not immediately respond to @entity0 calls friday for comment			0
assistant chief @entity109 told @entity33 that @entity7 struggled after getting hurt , saying he was aggressive and escalated the situation			1
" there 's a whole other side to this story that was n't videotaped , " @entity109 said			2
" there is nothing , on the surface , ( that ) deems our officer acted inappropriate at this time			0
" the @entity20 incident was one of a few such incidents involving police and shoppers at the chain 's stores nationwide			2
@entity22 said that @entity7 was " emotional " when she talked to him , briefly , on friday from a hospital where he was treated before being sent to jail			2
" he was complaining of his pain , and he was angry , " she said			0
she described her father as " a really nice man , " noting he is a custom furniture - maker who preaches through the @entity133 prison system			0
he has raised his grandson from birth and , even while in the hospital , @entity22 said the boy was her father 's chief concern			2
family members are hoping for a call from law enforcement , informing them that they can pick up @entity7 , @entity22 said			2
until then , she said her mother plans to talk to a lawyer saturday to work on expediting the man 's release			1
whatever happens , @entity22 vowed that next year she wo n't be shopping in the wee hours of the friday morning after @entity148			0
" i will never leave my house again on @entity5 , because i do n't want to put my daughter through that again , " she said , noting her daughter was there to see police standing over her bloody grandfather			0
