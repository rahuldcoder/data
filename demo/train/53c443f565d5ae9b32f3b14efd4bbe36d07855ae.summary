-- complete shock , surprise and disappointment -- that was my reaction to revelations from documents released by @entity7 that the @entity8 monitored my e-mails from 2006 to 2008 after i left the @entity10			1
i am one of five professionals featured in an article in @entity13 who found the government was monitoring us without our knowledge			1
the others are @entity19 , a well - known lawyer ; @entity20 , a professor at @entity21 ; @entity22 , a political science professor at @entity24 , and @entity25 , the executive director of the @entity26			1
what we share in common is that we are all @entity30			1
and none of us can believe there is any reason we should fall under suspicion			1
the technology the government uses to surreptitiously monitor domestic and international communications did n't surprise me			1
what was shocking to me was that nothing in my background would lead anyone to believe that i have any terrorist leanings or want to cause harm to the @entity44			2
i served my country in the @entity46 , worked as senior policy adviser in the @entity48 under president @entity49 , was involved in my community and even ran for public office			1
there is not much more anyone can do to prove his or her complete loyalty to the @entity44			2
what 's clear now is that the reason for spying on me is my religion			1
some people may argue that my ties to the @entity61 gave the government probable cause to monitor me			2
but i had received my @entity66 / @entity65 ( @entity65 ) clearance to work in the @entity48 after working with the @entity61 , not before			1
needless to say , all aspects of your life are examined to obtain this level			2
when i was working with the council , my goal was to get @entity30 involved in domestic politics , never foreign politics			1
working in @entity48 , i know more than others that sometimes people need to be monitored for security purposes , and there are times when such monitoring does not lead to anything			1
in those cases , however , at least something in those people 's background or actions would cause suspicion			1
for example , they met secretly with terrorist groups or made some statements inciting violence			2
none of those factors exist in my case			2
@entity96 needs to exercise its oversight authority and look at the @entity99 process and practice			2
on paper , the @entity99 procedure looks fair : an agent prepares an affidavit setting forth facts that establish probable cause that the subject is an agent of a foreign government			0
then an independent judge examines the application and approves it			0
that is a good process -- but in practice , 99 % of the applications are approved			0
clearly something is wrong that nearly all applications are approved			0
probable cause is clearly interpreted broadly in a @entity99 court			0
@entity96 needs to fix the practice			0
the issue for me is : what 's next ? i have no desire to file any sort of a lawsuit against the government			0
the @entity44 is my home and like any @entity44 , i want to protect my home			0
i demonstrated that by proudly wearing my country 's uniform			0
i am raising my kids here			0
i am clearly invested in my country			0
i think more @entity132 should be involved in government and in their communities			0
but i am concerned that many @entity30 , hearing the news of government monitoring , will say " what 's the point ? " they will believe that no matter what they do , they will always be viewed with suspicion			1
this to me is the saddest possible result			0
i would hope the intelligence community , law enforcement , @entity96 and the @entity145 administration are also concerned			0
i hope my kids will not have to worry about their e-mails being monitored for exercising their religious freedom to be involved with organizations that support their faith , like millions of other @entity44 .			1

@entity153 : documents released by @entity7 show he was under *surveillance*
@entity157 was in the @entity46 , was senior policy adviser in @entity48 under @entity49
@entity157 believes the only reason he came under suspicion was that he is @entity30
@entity157 says @entity30 must be free to join religious organizations without being spied upon
