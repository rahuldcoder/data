-- three times , @entity1 prepared to die on @entity3 , a @entity5 paradise turned to hell friday			1
friends he laughed with earlier in the day fell one by one in a gunman 's hail of fire			1
he survived to tell a horrifying tale saturday			1
when the shooting started friday afternoon , many of the 600 people at the ruling @entity16 's youth camp ran down a hill and to the water			1
the shooter came after them , screaming			1
" you are all going to die ! " @entity1 was one of the last ones remaining between the shooter and the water and did n't have time to take his heavy clothes or boots off			1
about 100 meters into the chilly water , he realized he would not make it			2
he would drown with all that weight			2
" i felt i could n't breathe			2
i already swallowed too much water , " he said			2
" i felt the clothes pulling me down			2
" he managed to swim back to shore and crouched behind a boulder with others			2
but the gunman found him			1
he was so close that @entity1 could see down the barrel of his weapon			1
he was sure to get a direct hit			2
@entity1 thought he was going to die			1
another survivor , @entity41 , described the gunman as having blond hair and pale skin			1
he carried three guns , he said			2
at times , he shot those guns with disarming calm , like he was shooting photographs			1
he even smiled , @entity41 said			2
@entity1 was surprised to hear the shooter speaking @entity5			1
he was certain a compatriot could never commit such a heinous act			2
" do you want to hurt a fellow @entity5 ? please , no. do n't shoot			2
" miraculously , the gunman pointed his weapon away			1
instead , he aimed for those who were desperately trying to swim to safety			2
as though @entity1 was too easy a target			1
as though it was more satisfying to shoot at a group of fleeing people , @entity1 thought			1
he heard his friends begging for help			2
some fell limp on @entity66			2
the gunman went away but returned to find @entity1 again , hiding with about 10 others			1
he could hear so many of them say : " please do n't shoot me			2
" one by one , their voices were silenced			2
a woman next to him was shot in the leg			1
@entity1 could see her wound was gaping			1
@entity1 clung to the dead			1
it was the only way he knew to survive			2
he heard footsteps getting closer			2
he could hear the heavy breathing of the man			2
then , " boom ! " @entity66 's world fell silent			1
but he could feel intense pain on the back of his left shoulder			1
he bore it , lay face down , and kept perfectly still			2
" i am sure he intended to hit me in the head , " @entity1 said			1
the gunman missed by inches			1
' i had to get out of there ' that afternoon , before the carnage , @entity98 spoke to her party 's youth about violence against women and children			1
it 's a big issue for the young member of parliament , who began her political career a decade ago in the youth movement			1
she came to idyllic @entity3 island often for such gatherings -- 11 times , to be exact			1
it was " the most beautiful adventure of the summer , " she said			0
she drew inspiration from @entity3			1
it was an important place for people from all over @entity5 to gather to discuss the future of their own nation as well as the problems plaguing other parts of the world			0
it was a place to get away from the daily grind , the day - to - day debates in parliament , and think big			1
and most of all , @entity98 said , @entity3 was a place of fraternity , of peace			1
" we love it there , " she said			0
it will be remembered from now on as a place where 85 people died , seemingly for no reason			0
@entity138 , a youth movement leader , assured everyone that they would be able to speak with counselors about the carnage they witnessed			0
" we will not be threatened to silence , " he said			0
" we will continue fighting for what we believe in			0
this is the best way to honor the memory of those we have now lost			0
we will go back to @entity3			1
" but it will be difficult			0
@entity98 will hear the gunfire play over and over again in her head , just like she did friday			0
after her speech friday afternoon , she was informed about the explosion in downtown @entity153			0
many of the youth camp attendees huddled for an informational meeting on what was happening to their colleagues in the government buildings			0
but when the shots rang out , the 600 people at the main building and surrounding camp scattered			0
@entity98 quickly realized she should not be alone and followed others tumbling down the hill			0
like @entity66 , she hid behind boulders on the beach			0
when there was a lull in the shooting , she thought it was over			0
but then it started again			0
terrifying minutes that seemed never - ending			0
she repositioned herself in another spot , away from the gunman 's sight			1
she found herself with a girl , shivering in her underwear , who had shed her clothes in a desperate but failed bid to swim away			0
@entity98 took off her jacket to warm her companion			0
" what is your name ? where are you from ? @entity190 to meet you , " they said to each other			0
" it was a conversation about nothing , " @entity98 said			0
that 's how they found calm in that moment of fear			1
@entity98 called her father , a police officer , on her mobile phone			1
" the police are on their way , " he reassured her			1
she imagined that all the police and ambulances in the area had rushed to @entity153 after the bombings			1
so her father 's words gave her relief			1
maybe the madness would end soon			0
shortly thereafter , she could hear helicopters overhead , and vehicles with sirens in the distance			0
she was one of the older people at the gathering			0
she felt a sense of obligation to calm the younger people around her			0
some were still in their teens			0
" you find some kind of way to get freakishly calm in that situation , " she said			0
finally , she heard someone say : " the police are here			1
" she hugged the man next to her			0
but within moments , the shooting began again			0
they had all been deceived -- the gunman was wearing a police uniform			1
" run , run , run ! " @entity98 shouted			0
she stumbled , fell , picked herself up			0
she had to keep running			0
" the only thing on my mind was that i had to get out of there , " she said			0
' bloody , bloody mess ' when real police officers finally showed up , the survivors were suspect			2
were these more gunmen in uniform ? " everyone started screaming , crying , begging the police to throw away their weapons , " @entity1 said			1
after about a two - hour ordeal , @entity66 and @entity98 were rescued -- @entity98 without injury and @entity66 with a gunshot wound that was closed up at the hospital			0
police arrested a man the @entity5 media identified as @entity256 , 32 , a @entity5 who apparently had taken issue with his homeland 's growing multi-culturalism			1
it was only many hours later , in his hospital bed , that @entity66 began realizing the magnitude of the " bloody , bloody mess			0
" recuperating after stitches saturday , @entity1 said fear was setting in anew			1
now he would begin to discover the names of the dead			2
they were friends who would never again share a laugh with him			0
police and rescue teams were still combing @entity3 island -- 13 boats on the water and a meter - by - meter land search , said @entity276 , president of @entity277			1
" we have now also mothers and fathers who do n't know if their sons or daughters are alive , " @entity276 said			0
" they are just waiting			0
" doctors cleared @entity66 for solid food saturday afternoon and he sought comfort in a plate of lasagna			0
" it was a perfect dinner for me right now , " he said			0
a moment of joy , perhaps			0
but for @entity66 , @entity98 and other survivors of the slaughter , a long journey of healing lies ahead .			0

@entity1 survived to tell a grim tale
he was shot in the shoulder but stayed still so the gunman would think him dead
many others on @entity3 were not so lucky
