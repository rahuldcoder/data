" after a performance like that and him getting on , if you were one of his advisers you would n't tell @entity3 to fight me , " the 31 - year - old added			2
@entity1 retired after losing to @entity3 's brother , @entity23 on points in july 2011 , but came out of retirement to fight @entity5 after the @entity27 pair brawled at a press conference which followed @entity5 's loss on points to @entity3 in @entity31 last february			1

it was a measuring stick to show how i performed against his last opponent			0

but the 40 - year - old 's future in the sport is uncertain			0
his next fight against @entity43 's @entity42 is scheduled to take place in @entity45 on september 8 , but it could be his last as the @entity47 looks to concentrate on a political career			2
former world heavyweight champion , @entity1 impressed on his return to the ring stopping @entity5 in the 5th round of the much - hyped grudge match			1
the fight was a predictably lively affair , with @entity1 and @entity56 - born @entity5 finally exchanging blows after trading a string of insults in the weeks leading up to the fight			1
@entity1 vs. @entity5 ? that 's just handbags - watch the women at the @entity63 but it was @entity1 's power allied to some trademark nimble glove work which finally prevailed as the 10 - round fight sanctioned by the @entity69 neared the halfway stage			1
towards the end of the fifth round , the 31 - year old unleashed a devastating left - hook before a follow - up right hand floored @entity5			0
the @entity56 - born fighter made referee @entity78 's count comfortably but crashed to the canvas again seconds later following a barrage of punches from @entity1			2
he staggered to his feet a second time but @entity78 stopped the fight leaving @entity1 to milk the cheers from a boisterous 30,000 - strong crowd			2
sworn enemies before saturday 's fight , @entity1 and @entity5 finished the night exchanging pats , smiles and handshakes in front of photographers , before both publicly declaring a truce to their bitter war of words			1
" whatever beef i had with @entity5 before the fight is over now from my side and i hope it 's vice versa , " @entity1 told @entity96			1
" after sharing a ring with @entity5 i have a new found respect for the man			0
i had respect for his boxing ability but i never believed he could be as good as he was tonight			0
he raised his game , " @entity1 added			0
the two men had made up and could now " eat in the same restaurants and go to the same clubs , " the 28 - year - old said			0
" it was a great fight and everything is done			0
" @entity115 stunned in @entity116 it was a less happy night for @entity6 's @entity115 , who suffered a shock defeat at the hands of @entity120 in their light - welterweight world title clash in @entity116			1
the referee stepped in to stop the fight in the fourth round after @entity4 champion @entity120 launched a series of blistering attacks on @entity115 which saw the @entity6 felled three times			1
" i always knew i had it in me			0
i feel like the great fighters bring the best out of me and @entity115 is a great fighter , " @entity120 said after the fight			2
@entity115 , who has now lost three times in 26 professional bouts , posted an message on his official @entity135 page saying : " can i apologize to my family friends and everyone			0
i got caught with a shot and i know millions of u are upset but that 's boxing for u. " the 25 - year - old lost his @entity145 ( @entity145 ) and @entity146 ( @entity146 ) belts to @entity147 in december 2011 , but was reinstated as the @entity145 champion earlier this month after the @entity149 failed a drugs test prior to their scheduled rematch in may			2
the @entity146 are still to decide on what course of action they will take regarding the original fight .			0
