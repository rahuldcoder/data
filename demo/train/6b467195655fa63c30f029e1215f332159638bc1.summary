-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 vetoed a bill late monday that would have required president @entity4 and other presidential candidates to prove they were @entity6 citizens , born in the @entity6 , before their names could have been placed on the state ballot			1
the so - called " birther bill " got final approval in the @entity10 last week			0
now that @entity1 , a @entity12 , has vetoed it , the bill will not become law unless legislators vote to override her veto			1
" as a former secretary of state , i do not support designating one person as a gatekeeper to the ballot for a candidate , which could lead to arbitrary or politically - motivated decisions , " the governor wrote in a letter addressed to the @entity20 speaker			0
under the measure , if there were any dispute about whether a candidate had proved he or she had been born in the @entity6 , @entity2 's secretary of state would have the final say			1
" this measure creates significant new problems while failing to do anything constructive for @entity2 , " she added			0
@entity4 has been hounded by allegations since he began running for president in 2008 that he was not born in @entity6			1
critics contend , among other things , that he was born in his father 's home country of @entity43			0
the @entity6 @entity44 stipulates that only " natural born " citizens are eligible to be president			1
@entity4 has insisted that he was born in @entity47 , and the allegations against him have been repeatedly discredited in investigations by @entity0 and other organizations			1
nevertheless , the issue remains politically potent among segments of the electorate and has served as a rallying cry for many of the president 's opponents , most recently potential @entity12 presidential candidate @entity58			2
@entity59 's take on @entity58 the author of the so - called " birther bill , " @entity61 rep. @entity60 , has said the bill was not targeted at @entity4 , but at " maintaining the integrity of the @entity44			1
" among other things , a candidate would have to show a copy of his or her birth certificate			0
if a birth certificate could n't be produced , a candidate would have to show a combination of baptismal or circumcision records , hospital birth files , postpartum medical records or other documents			0
candidates also would have to submit affidavits declaring their citizenship as well as sworn statements regarding their residency for the previous 14 years			0
" i never imagined being presented with a bill that could require candidates for president of the greatest and most powerful nation on earth to submit their ' early baptismal or circumcision certificates ' among other records to the @entity2 secretary of state			2
this is a bridge too far , " wrote @entity1			2
fourteen other states are considering similar legislation this year , according to @entity97 , a senior fellow with the @entity98			0
measures have failed in three states -- @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			0
@entity4 's sister criticizes ' birthers ' in an effort to counter the charges of the birthers , @entity4 's 2008 campaign produced a " certification of live birth , " a document traditionally accepted legally as confirmation of a birth			0
both the current @entity47 governor , @entity116 , a @entity117 , and the previous governor , @entity119 , a @entity12 , have insisted that @entity4 was born in their home state			2
nearly 75 % of @entity6 believe @entity4 was definitely or probably born in the @entity6 , according to a march 11 - 13 @entity123 poll			1
more than four in 10 republicans , however , believe the president probably or definitely was not born in @entity6 .			1

gov. @entity1 says the bill is " a bridge too far "
it would have required presidential *hopefuls* to prove they were born in the @entity6
president @entity4 has fought allegations that he was n't born in @entity6
