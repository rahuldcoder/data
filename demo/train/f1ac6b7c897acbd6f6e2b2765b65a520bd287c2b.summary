@entity0 , @entity1 -- as western powers try to verify claims that the @entity1 government used chemical weapons this week in a northeastern suburb of @entity0 , the @entity1 government is accusing rebel forces of doing the same			1
state - run television reported saturday that @entity1 armed forces had surrounded @entity12 , the opposition - held district on the edge of @entity0 that saw some of the 1,300 reported dead in wednesday 's early morning attack			1
several of the soldiers were " suffocating " from exposure to gases as they entered the city , according to state tv			0
" it is believed that the terrorists have used chemical weapons in the area , " @entity1 tv reporting , citing anonymous source			1
the government uses the term " terrorists " to describe rebel forces			2
it showed video of a room containing gas masks and gas canisters that the @entity38 said were discovered in a storage facility in @entity12			2
@entity2 could not independently confirm the veracity of the claims or the authenticity of the video			0
opposition leaders deny involvement in the attack , which they say killed hundreds near the capital			1
the competing claims surfaced as a @entity50 official told @entity2 that president @entity51 was meeting with his national security team to discuss the alleged chemical weapons attack " once we ascertain the facts , the president will make an informed decision about how to respond , " the official said on condition of anonymity			1
" we have a range of options available , and we are going to act very deliberately so that we 're making decisions consistent with our national interest as well as our assessment of what can advance our objectives in @entity1			1
" in an exclusive interview with @entity2 that aired friday , @entity51 said the @entity70 and @entity71 inspectors were gathering information on the attack , but that preliminary signs pointed to a " big event of grave concern			2
" " it is very troublesome , " he said			0
" that starts getting to some core national interests that the @entity70 has , both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating , as well as needing to protect our allies , our bases in the region			2
" the @entity1 government has steadfastly denied its forces used chemical weapons outside @entity0 or elsewhere			1
" we said it from the first moment and , here , we assure again that we have never used chemical weapons ( around @entity12 ) or any other region in any form whatsoever -- ... liquid , gas or whatever , " information minister @entity95 said saturday in an interview with a private @entity98 channel			1
@entity101 went on to say that , on the contrary , his government is " quite certain that ( the rebels ) are the ones using chemical weapons			1
" the opposition , though , has a rebel different view			2
@entity111 secretary - general @entity110 said friday that rockets -- some with chemical warheads and others conventional weapons -- had been fired into a heavily populated civilian area			2
most of the more than 1,300 reported dead were killed by chemical weapons , said @entity119 , a spokesman for the umbrella opposition group			1
@entity121 said that medical teams in the affected area had administered 25,000 shots of atropine -- a medication used to treat people exposed to the nerve gas sarin -- after the attack			1
@entity130 showed rows of bodies without apparent injury , as well as people suffering convulsions or apparently struggling to breathe			0
@entity2 could not verify where or when the videos were recorded , and could not confirm the number of casualties			0
adding weight to the assertions that chemical weapons were used was a statement saturday by @entity144 , also known as @entity144			1
three hospitals -- all supported by the international organization -- in @entity1 's @entity0 governorate reported having received some 3,600 patients displaying neurotoxic symptoms last wednesday morning , the statement said			1
of them , 355 reportedly died , it said			0
" medical staff working in these facilities provided detailed information to @entity144 doctors regarding large numbers of patients arriving with symptoms including convulsions , excess saliva , pinpoint pupils , blurred vision and respiratory distress , " said dr. @entity152 , @entity144 director of operations			0
patients were treated using atropine			0
" @entity144 can neither scientifically confirm the cause of these symptoms nor establish who is responsible for the attack , " said @entity152			0
" however , the reported symptoms of the patients , in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events --- characterized by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time , the origin of the patients , and the contamination of medical and first aid workers -- strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent			0
" how will the world respond ? on saturday , world leaders weighed their options			0
a @entity189 spokesperson said @entity191 prime minister @entity190 -- who also talked with his @entity193 counterpart @entity192 -- spoke saturday to @entity51			1
" they reiterated that significant use of chemical weapons would merit a serious response from the international community and both have tasked officials to examine all the options , " the spokesperson said			1
the @entity50 issued a statement on the same conversation , saying the two leaders agreed to " consult closely regarding this incident , as well as possible responses by the international community to the use of chemical weapons			1
" if the claims that @entity1 used chemical weapons prove true , a speedy response will be needed to prevent another such attack , @entity70 defense secretary @entity210 said			1
@entity216 's comments friday came after a senior @entity218 official told @entity2 that military planners have updated @entity1 target lists			2
and it was disclosed that a fourth @entity70 ship armed with cruise missiles has arrived in the eastern @entity223			2
@entity216 addressed the issue aboard a military plane headed to @entity226			0
" we will determine at some point here very shortly what did happen , " he said , according to a transcript posted on the @entity218 's website			0
" if , in fact , this was a deliberate use and attack by the @entity1 government on its own people using chemical weapons , there may be another attack coming , " @entity216 said			1
" a very quick assessment of what happened and whatever appropriate response should be made			0
" @entity216 said the @entity70 military provided @entity51 " with options for all contingencies , and that requires positioning our forces , positioning our assets to be able to carry out different options , whatever options the president might choose			1
" he did not specify what those options might include			0
@entity216 predicted other nations would lend their support if the investigation finds that the @entity1 government used chemical weapons against its people			1
" this is an international community issue ; it violates every standard of international behavior , " he said			0
" that said , the @entity70 has never given up its own sovereign right to protect its own interests			2
" the president has said he does not anticipate using ground forces in @entity1			1
other military options could include airstrikes by fighter jets or cruise missiles			0
the @entity275 destroyer @entity274 has arrived in the region , a defense official said late friday			0
it was intended to replace the @entity278 , but the @entity278 will remain temporarily along with the @entity279 and @entity280			0
all four are equipped with cruise missiles			0
the president has authorized a limited amount of military hardware for the rebels in addition to logistical and humanitarian assistance			0
a senior @entity218 official told @entity2 that options for direct military action include targeting @entity293 's capability to deliver chemical weapons			1
@entity296 lists could include government buildings and military installations , the official said , but the military must have flexible plans to target forces and equipment which " continue to move			2
" sen. @entity304 , @entity305 , an advocate for a more forceful @entity70 response to the @entity1 conflict , has suggested that @entity70 air power could take out runways and planes used by @entity293 's forces that he said are " dominating the battlefields and the towns and the cities			1
" @entity304 also has advocated giving rebels anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapons to establish a no fly zone			0
but administration officials have cautioned that some @entity1 rebel factions have ties to @entity322 terrorists			2
@entity324 chairman gen. @entity323 said this week in a letter to a member of @entity327 that arming rebels requires " choosing one among many sides			0
" " it is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor , " @entity323 wrote			0
" today , they are not			0
" also saturday , a top @entity71 official arrived in @entity0 to press the government to cooperate in the investigation into its alleged use of chemical weapons			1
@entity344 , the @entity71 high representative for disarmament affairs , has been instructed by @entity71 secretary general ban ki - moon to push the government to cooperate with the @entity71 team already on the ground			0
@entity71 inspectors want to reach the site of the alleged chemical weapons attack quickly in order to gather evidence while it is still fresh			1
opposition leaders say the reported attack killed more than 1,300 people in a @entity0 suburb			1
@entity360 foreign minister @entity359 said saturday the inspectors should be granted immediate access to the site " if the @entity1 regime has nothing to hide			2
" " all the information available to us converge to say that there has been a chemical massacre in @entity1 , near @entity0 , and to indicate that it is the regime of @entity377 who is at the origin , " @entity359 told reporters after meeting with @entity368 officials in the @entity370 city of @entity371			1
earlier , @entity191 foreign secretary @entity379 suggested the delay in granting access was suspicious			2
" this is not something that a humane or civilized world can ignore , " @entity379 said			0
our priority is to make sure the world knows the facts of what has happened , and that means the @entity71 team that is in @entity0 , only 20 minutes away , being able to get there and to investigate			2
" rapid access is critical , since any evidence would deteriorate " over a matter of days , " @entity379 said			0
the @entity1 government has denied using chemical weapons			1
@entity2 's @entity395 reported from @entity0 , and @entity2 's @entity396 wrote from @entity397			2
