@entity24 was defense minister at the time of the alleged negotiations , and the @entity11 says his signature is on one of the memos			2

" much of the rest of the visible part of the document is about keeping the agreement secret			0
it makes reference to an " @entity61 , " which does not appear in the @entity11 article			0
