@entity27 : neighbor was first to call 911 an @entity29 headed to nearby @entity30 crashed into the family 's house in @entity33 on december 8 , 2008 , after the pilot reported having trouble			1

wednesday 's verdict came almost exactly seven years after @entity10 married his late wife on christmas day 2004 , said @entity16			1
@entity10 has said he does not blame the pilot and has urged prayers for the pilot not to suffer			1
@entity10 still lives in @entity33 , with his sister and brother - in - law , @entity16 said			1

the @entity6 sacked four top officers of the fighter squadron and disciplined nine other @entity6 after an investigation showed deferred maintenance and faulty decisions by ground controllers and the pilot contributed to the crash			0
the investigation found the jet 's right engine experienced a string of emergencies that left it relying on the left engine , which had already given mechanics indications of a problem			0
though maintenance rules do n't require immediate repairs for the problem , the squadron flew the jet 146 times before it eventually crashed because the left engine was starved for fuel			0
the investigation criticized the pilot for not consulting a pocket checklist that outlined emergency procedures			0
and while controllers aboard the aircraft carrier that launched the jet urged the pilot to land at a nearby @entity134 airfield at @entity135 , squadron officers relied on " incorrect assumptions and inaccurate data " to guide him back to the plane 's base at @entity30 , the investigation found .			0
