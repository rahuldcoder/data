he runs his terror group like a ceo -- with spreadsheets on missions , assassinations and captured assets			0
and reports from @entity10 's government suggest @entity12 leader @entity11 may have been hit in airstrikes over the weekend -- though it 's not clear whether he was wounded , whose strikes he may have been hit by and in what part of the country he may have been struck			1
but if @entity19 is dead , what would happen to the radical @entity21 militant group ? do n't expect @entity12 to just crumble			1
" it will morph , and new leaders will emerge , " retired @entity24 maj. gen. @entity22 said			0
" in fact , bear in mind that @entity12 leadership originated from @entity31 's military			2
these are very conventionally trained , very professional leaders			1
" odds are @entity19 or the @entity35 , which handles the group 's religious and military affairs , has planned this scenario in advance			1
" @entity12 likely has a clear line of succession , " said @entity41 of the @entity42			2
" this is a bureaucratic organization with a deep bench ... either @entity19 has signed off on the line of succession himself or the @entity35 has agreed to a line of succession			1
" top two deputies @entity53 has a cabinet of advisers as well as two top deputies -- @entity56 , who oversees @entity12 ' mission in @entity10 , and @entity58 , who is in charge of operations in @entity61 , according to the @entity62			1
both men are veteran @entity10 military officials who served under @entity31			2
" these people who had previously served in @entity31 's army were extremely brutal because @entity31 's regime was very brutal , " said @entity64 of @entity65			0
" but they also inherited the disciplines and the military skills that are now benefiting @entity12 in its campaign against its enemies			0
" analysts say @entity56 could make a strong case to become the leader of @entity12 if @entity11 is taken out			1
" he would also have had to have a lot of outstanding qualities either in the political or the military field , and that certainly makes him a potential contender , " @entity64 said			0
beneath each deputy are 12 governors for both @entity10 and @entity61			1
those governors handle financial , military , legal , media and intelligence councils , among others			0
what 's interesting about the bureaucratic hierarchy of @entity12 is that it looks a lot like those of some @entity94 countries whose values it rejects -- except there 's no democracy involved and there 's a council tasked with considering who to behead			0
another possibility then there 's @entity61 @entity104 , the chief spokesman for @entity12 who could also take over the group			2
in september , @entity104 called for @entity12 supporters to launch lone - wolf attacks			0
analysts say some of @entity11 's top deputies were imprisoned with the spokesman at @entity111 , a @entity24 - run detention center in @entity10 where @entity19 was also held for at least four years			1
" he was able to trust these individuals as sharing his ideology , sharing his hatred for the @entity116 , " @entity41 said			0
the @entity35 's importance if @entity19 is still alive , there 's one group of people who can take him out even without the use of airstrikes or violence			2
the @entity35 is the religious monitor for @entity12			1
not only does it make sure all the local councils and governors are sticking to @entity12 ' version of @entity130 law , it has the ability to stand up to @entity19			2
" the @entity35 has the right to tell @entity19 to go if he 's not adhering to @entity12 ' religious standards , " said @entity132 of the @entity133			1
" it would most probably never happen , but the fact that it 's possible indicates the council 's prominence			0
" she said the recent beheadings of @entity94 hostages @entity143 , @entity144 , and @entity145 would have fallen under the shura council 's purview			0
on top of that , @entity132 said , the @entity35 also has the power to censure the leadership for running afoul of its interpretation of @entity154 law			2
but what happens if @entity19 dies might just be hypothetical for now			0
while some @entity10 officials say the @entity12 leader was wounded in an airstrike , @entity24 officials say they ca n't confirm whether @entity19 was hit at all			1
@entity1 's @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 contributed to this report .			0

@entity12 leader @entity11 may have been wounded in an airstrike
even if he gets killed , a *throng* of " very professional leaders " could take his place
@entity53 has two top deputies , one over operations in @entity10 and one over @entity61
the @entity35 , @entity12 ' religious monitor , could tell @entity19 to go
