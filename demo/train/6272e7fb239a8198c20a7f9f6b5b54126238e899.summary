-- @entity1 has announced a plan that could see high - speed fiber internet networks rolled out in as many as 100 cities in 21 metro regions throughout the @entity6			1
it 's a move that puts the telecommunications company in a head - to - head battle with @entity10 , which has begun its own charge to dramatically increase internet speeds in various cities			1
the network , called @entity15 with @entity16 , is able to deliver broadband at up to 1 gigabit per second			1
that 's roughly 100 times faster than current speeds in many parts of the nation			0
the company plans to enter discussions with local leaders in areas it has identified as having suitable existing networks and likely high demand for the service			2
" this initiative continues @entity1 's ongoing commitment to economic development in these communities , bringing jobs , advanced technologies and infrastructure , " the company said in a news release			2
the metropolitan areas being considered are : @entity41 ; @entity42 , @entity43 ; @entity44 , @entity45 ; @entity46 ; @entity47 ; @entity48 , @entity49 ; @entity50 , @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity45 ; @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity51 ; @entity55 , @entity56 ; @entity57 ; @entity58 ; @entity59 ; @entity60 , @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity51 ; @entity63 , @entity49 ; @entity64 ; @entity65 ; @entity66 , and @entity67			0
@entity1 had already announced plans to install the high - speed network in @entity70 and @entity71 , @entity49 , and says it is in " advanced discussions " with @entity73 and @entity74 , @entity45			1
it 's worth emphasizing that none of this is a guarantee yet			0
more likely , it 's @entity1 publicly pointing out locations it thinks are good candidates for network upgrades			2
@entity10 , meanwhile , first launched @entity83 in 2012			2
that service also promises speeds of 1 gigabit per second , which the company says could allow someone at full capacity to download an entire feature - length movie in 38 seconds			1
@entity10 has already brought the service to @entity55 , @entity56 ; and @entity92 , @entity93 and plans to roll out in @entity70 , @entity49 , by the end of this year			0
@entity10 connects fiberoptic cables directly to a home or office in order to give users broadband internet and television service			0
in @entity55 and @entity92 , @entity10 's ultra-fast internet service costs $ 70 a month for @entity101 , or $ 120 if you add streaming video			0
in february , @entity10 said it 's exploring plans to lay down the special cables in nine more metro areas : @entity41 , @entity44 , @entity59 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity73 - @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity63 and @entity67			1
that includes 34 cities in those regions .			0

@entity1 looks to bring high - speed internet to 21 major metro areas
@entity15 with @entity16 offers speeds up to 1 gigabit per second
the move would compete with @entity83 with similar speed
