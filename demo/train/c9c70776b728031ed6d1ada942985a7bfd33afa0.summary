-- a @entity2 district judge ordered @entity3 to pay $ 128 million in to firefighters who allege the city used an entrance exam that deliberately sought to keep african - americans and @entity8 off the force			1
the judge also ordered the @entity11 to hire 293 black and @entity8 applicants			2
" it has been in the city 's power to prevent or remedy the need for damages proceedings for a decade , and it has not done so , " @entity2 district judge @entity13 said in his ruling on the class action lawsuit			1
he called it the " consequences of the city 's decision to ignore clear violations of federal law			1
" the federal government had sued the city ( @entity2 and @entity29 vs. @entity3 ) over fire department entrance exams they said discriminated against black and @entity8 applicants			1
a group of black firefighters alleged the city had intentionally discriminated against them , violating @entity36 , the @entity37 and state law			2
the lawsuit alleged that the exams had little to do with firefighting and instead focused on cognitive and reading skills			0
because of the hereditary nature of the fire department , white candidates were recruited and supported throughout the application process by family or neighborhood contacts and whites consistently passed while minority candidates failed			0
" there has been one persistent stain on the @entity56 's record , " the lawsuit said			2
" for decades , black and other minority firefighters have been severely underrepresented in the @entity11 's ranks			0
" according to the most recent census data , black residents make up 25.6 % of @entity3 's population ; when this case was filed in 2007 , black firefighters accounted for only 3.4 % of the @entity11 's force			1
in other words , in a city of over eight million people , and out of a force with 8,998 firefighters , there were only 303 black firefighters			1
" this pattern of underrepresentation has remained essentially unchanged since at least the 1960s			0
while the city 's other uniformed services have made rapid progress integrating black members into their ranks , the @entity56 has stagnated and at times retrogressed			1
" @entity79 , @entity3 's corporation counsel , disputed the decision			1
" we believe the court 's latest opinion is erroneous and , in any event , is the first step in a lengthy process			1
as the court itself noted , any damages the city ultimately must pay will be reduced by the amount each member of the class earned			2
when all the proceedings have been completed , the damages , if any , that the city will have to pay will be far less than $ 128 million , " he said			1
in court documents , the city said of the judge 's finding of bias : " under the @entity118 's faulty analysis , any rational jury would necessarily find that the @entity119 deliberately used facially neutral exams to suppress black employment even as it conducted a targeted multi-million - dollar minority recruitment campaign , enlisted @entity99 to study methods of maximizing @entity11 diversity , increased the minority composition of its other uniformed services , engaged an expert with a mandate to design an improved exam , and devised a panoply of other devices to diversify the @entity11 's ranks " the lack of minorities in @entity2 fire departments has been the focus of many lawsuits			1
the last available national figures , from the 2000 census , show 8.4 % of the nation 's firefighting forces to be black and 8.6 % to be @entity8			0
blacks are 12.2 % of the population ; @entity134 are roughly 16 %			2
however , other big cities have made much faster progress at diversifying their ranks			0
more than half of the @entity139 and @entity140 fire departments members are black or @entity8			0
lawyers for the firefighters who sued said the decision would mean payments to black and @entity8 applicants to the @entity11 who were never hired or hired late from the 1999 and 2002 eligibility lists that resulted from exams given those years			0
@entity149 , past president of the @entity29 , said : " the @entity29 has been fighting for almost 75 years to open the doors of the @entity56 to black firefighters			0
this is a great victory for those who have been excluded from serving our city because of their race			0
we hope the @entity11 moves quickly to welcome the @entity160 and @entity8 applicants who are entitled to be hired , and we look forward to serving with them			0
" @entity0 's @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
