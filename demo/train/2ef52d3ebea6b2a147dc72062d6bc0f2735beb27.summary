-- travel to @entity2 , a port city in @entity4 , and you will find the stirrings of something unexpected : entrepreneurial capitalism			0
this part of @entity11 , home to many mega-factories like those of @entity14 ( which makes @entity16 's @entity15 ) is known as the world 's workshop			2
but if you visit @entity20 , a startup firm funded by venture capital , you will find a group of tech entrepreneurs with a global mindset trying to disrupt an overpriced , legacy - ridden industry ( in their case , the one for medical diagnostics equipment )			0
in the staff canteen hangs a portrait of the late @entity32 uttering his motto , " stay hungry , stay foolish			0
" @entity35 's dynamic founder says his dream is for @entity11 to become an innovation powerhouse that produces its own homegrown @entity16			1
much has been made about @entity40 sweatshops sucking away @entity42 jobs , of currency manipulation and unfair trade practices			2
in fact , there 's a bigger threat to @entity42 competitiveness			2
@entity11 is fading fast , and innovative @entity11 is emerging			1
the @entity40 government is investing tens of billions of dollars into science and engineering research and education , and lavishing tax breaks and subsidies on technology firms and clusters , in an effort to leapfrog the country to the cutting edge of innovation			0
how should @entity42 and other developed economies respond and stay on top in the 21st century 's ideas economy ? for a start , do no harm			1
politicians should remember that global innovation is not a zero - sum game : @entity11 's rise does not have to come at @entity42 's expense			1
three decades ago , many cassandras wailed that @entity75 , with its centrally planned innovation investments and its superior cultural values , would crush the @entity76			0
in fact , @entity75 's peaceful rise went hand in hand with @entity42 's entrepreneurs forging the new industries of the digital age			1
that is why bashing @entity11 and using it as an excuse for industrial policies that subsidize uncompetitive domestic companies is a folly			1
this applies as much to @entity89 , a bankrupt @entity42 solar firm that got taxpayer subsidies , as it does to the lagging @entity92 toymaking industry , which has been declared " strategic			2
" an even more dangerous prospect is a trade war , something that might happen as a result of @entity98 governments ganging up on @entity11 at the @entity99 over its policies on rare @entity102 minerals			1
top - down efforts to pick technology winners are bound to waste taxpayers ' money			0
and forcing a trade war would actually hurt @entity42 , since its economy benefits the most from an open global flow of goods , people and ideas			2
@entity42 's leaders should see @entity11 's inexorable surge as a rising tide that can lift all boatsâ € ” providing , of course , that you patch the holes in your vessel first			1
that means shoring up the things that made @entity42 the world 's innovation powerhouse in the first place			1
first , @entity42 needs to reverse its policies that , since 9/11 , have turned hostile toward talented immigrants			1
for decades , the @entity42 economy benefited from the gift of the world 's brightest and most enterprising			2
studies have shown that more than a third of the start - ups in @entity134 have at least one founder born in @entity136 or @entity11			2
@entity137 points out the absurdity of today 's immigration policies			1
brilliant @entity40 students make up much of the graduate program in computer science at the @entity143 , benefiting from a subsidized education			0
when they graduate and want to start companies that would hire many @entity42 , they are refused visas			0
so , as @entity137 notes , they go home and start companies there that compete with @entity42 instead			0
another hole that needs to be patched is in research funding			0
@entity42 's funding for research , measured as a percent of national output , has stagnated even as the rising giants of the developing world are investing heavily			0
it is wise to invest during economic recessions in those few thingsâ € ” like education , smart infrastructure and researchâ € ” that are the essential enablers of longer term innovation , productivity and higher economic growth			0
finally , @entity42 can make it easier for young firms , which have created almost all the net new jobs the last few decades , to find capital			1
banks usually refuse to fund start - ups , and even many venture capitalists have turned risk averse			0
typically , entrepreneurs rely on friends , family and fools			0
but an important bill in @entity180 now that has support from both parties and the @entity183 would make it easier to tap wider networks through " crowdfunding			1
" @entity180 should pass this bill quickly , and help entrepreneurial energy to kick - start growth			1
the surest path from stagnation to rejuvenation lies in innovation			0
if @entity42 wants to stay at the top , it needs to gear up on innovation			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

@entity199 : @entity11 is fading fast , and innovative @entity11 is emerging
@entity202 : if @entity42 wants to stay on top , it needs to spur innovation
he says @entity42 needs better immigration policies to *retain* talents
he says @entity180 should pass a bill to make it easier to fund entrepreneurs
