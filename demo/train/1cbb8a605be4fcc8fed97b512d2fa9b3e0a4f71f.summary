pope @entity0 made his strongest condemnation yet of sexual abuse by @entity4 clergy on friday , asking for forgiveness and pledging to impose penalties on " men of the church " who harm children			1
" i feel compelled to personally take on all the evil which some priests -- quite a few in number , obviously not compared to the number of all the priests -- to personally ask for forgiveness for the damage they have done for having sexually abused children , " the @entity0 said in remarks quoted by @entity12			1
" the church is aware of this damage , it is personal , moral damage carried out by men of the church , and we will not take one step backward with regards to how we will deal with this problem , and the sanctions that must be imposed , " @entity0 continued			1
" on the contrary , we have to be even stronger			0
because you can not interfere with children			2
" the @entity37 - based @entity36 said it may be the first time a pope has spoken of sanctioning " complicit bishops			0
" " but that is all it is : talk , " said @entity41 , @entity36 's outreach director			0
" we beg the world 's @entity45 : be impressed by deeds , not words			2
until the @entity0 takes decisive action that protects kids , be skeptical and vigilant			0
" the @entity0 's new comments , made friday to members of a @entity4 nongovernmental organization , the @entity51 , represent a shift from his previous statements on sexual abuse			1
in an interview with @entity60 newspaper @entity59 in march , @entity0 struck a defensive tone , saying , " the @entity45 is perhaps the only public institution that has moved with transparency and responsibility			2
no one has done more			0
and yet the church is the only one that has been attacked			0
" advocates for victims of sexual abuse had slammed those remarks , calling them another example of the church prioritizing its reputation over the protection of children			1
' highest priority ' early this year , a @entity79 panel slammed the @entity12 's handling of child sexual abuse within the @entity45 and accused the church of protecting itself rather than the victims			1
the @entity12 said in february that it would study the report , which claimed clerics were involved in the sexual abuse of " tens of thousands " of children			1
and in late march , @entity0 appointed an eight - member committee -- a mix of clergy and laypeople , including a sexual abuse survivor -- to advise the church on how to protect children , punish abusers and train church staff			1
" @entity0 has made it clear that the church must uphold the protection of minors amongst her highest priorities , " @entity12 spokesman the rev. @entity98 said in a statement announcing the committee members			2
however , the @entity36 dismissed the new panel , saying it was " based on a deceptive premise " and perpetuated the " self - serving myth that @entity4 officials need more information about abuse and coverups			0
" rocked by scandal @entity0 took over the helm of the @entity45 just over a year ago from @entity116 , whose papacy was marked by the emergence of repeated allegations of sexual abuse by priests			1
@entity116 said many times that abusers should be prosecuted , but victims ' groups again said he did too little			0
@entity116 spoke with some victims of sexual abuse by priests on papal visits to countries including the @entity37 and the @entity131 , where he expressed his " deep sorrow " about the scandal			2
the @entity12 selected those he met			0
in april 2013 , a month after taking office , @entity0 recommended that the church 's doctrinal office " act decisively with regard to cases of sexual abuse , " the @entity12 said at the time			1
this would be " by promoting measures for the protection of minors , as well as in offering assistance to those who have suffered abuse , carrying out due proceedings against the guilty , " it said			0
kick out those who sexually abuse children , @entity79 panel tells @entity12			0

pope @entity0 says he feels compelled to " personally ask for forgiveness " for priest abuse
" we will not take one step backward with regards to how we will deal with this problem "
@entity0 says the @entity45 must act strongly because " you can not interfere with children "
advocates for victims of sexual abuse say the church has not done enough to protect children
