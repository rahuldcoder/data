-- one of the world 's oldest sports may have lost its grip in the @entity4			2
the @entity5 of the @entity6 announced tuesday that it has recommended dropping wrestling from the @entity9 beginning in 2020			1
" wrestling will now join the seven shortlisted sports -- baseball / softball , karate , roller sports , sport climbing , squash , wakeboarding and wushu -- vying for inclusion in the 2020 @entity4 program as an additional sport , " the @entity6 said in a statement			1
the governing body for the sport in the @entity25 was so appalled at the decision , it started a @entity28 page , " @entity29 in the @entity30			1
" in a statement , @entity11 chief executive officer @entity31 said , " it is important to remember that today 's action is a recommendation , and we hope that there will be a meaningful opportunity to discuss the important role that wrestling plays in the sports landscape both in the @entity25 and around the world			1
" at a meeting in @entity46 in may , representatives from the eight sports will make presentations for inclusion in the @entity49			2
the @entity5 will recommend one			0
the final word will come in a vote at the @entity6 's general session in @entity54 in september			1
whichever sport is chosen will join the 25 sports the @entity6 listed tuesday as core sports for 2020 : athletics ( track and field ) , rowing , badminton , basketball , boxing , canoeing , cycling , equestrian , fencing , football ( soccer ) , gymnastics , weightlifting , handball , field hockey , judo , swimming , modern pentathlon , taekwondo , tennis , table tennis , shooting , archery , triathlon , sailing and volleyball			1
wrestling will be included in the 2016 games in @entity85			1
opponents of the decision also took to @entity88 , posting to the hashtag # @entity89			2
" the @entity6 has found a way , besides alien invasion , to unite @entity25 , @entity46 and @entity93			1
fight begins anew , " tweeted @entity94 , a multimedia journalist in @entity95 , a hotbed for the sport			2
@entity99 , who won an olympic gold medal before becoming a professional wrestler , wrote , " @entity102 for the @entity103			0
" others wondered how sports like equestrian and disciplines like race walking and rhythmic gymnastics survived			2
and as people are wont to do these days , they turned to the @entity114 petition site , creating two asking the president to put pressure on the @entity6 to overturn its decision and one to boycott the @entity4 if wrestling is not included			1
they each had fewer than 5,000 signatures as of tuesday afternoon			0
wrestling has been a part of all but one of the modern @entity4 since their inception in 1896 , missing only the 1900 games in @entity126			1
indeed , the website for @entity129 cites wrestling as " one of the longest practiced sports -- perhaps only losing to athletics			1
" " there are records of fights dating back to 3000 @entity137 , and the sport was part of the @entity125 , " the website says			2
the sport has been contested in two styles , @entity142 and freestyle , since the 1920 games in @entity144			0
seventy - two wrestling medals were awarded at the @entity30 last year			0
so why , with such a rich history , is wrestling fighting with wakeboarding and wushu for survival ? " in an effort to ensure the @entity4 remain relevant to sports fans of all generations , the @entity151 systematically reviews every sport following each edition of the @entity4 , " the @entity6 said in its statement tuesday			1
" nonsense , " said the @entity157 , headquartered in @entity158			0
the group says it represents wrestlers from 180 countries , including many where wrestling is the national sport and the only sport that gives athletes a route to participation in the @entity4			0
federation officials will meet this week in @entity169 to discuss the @entity6 's decision and how to make a case for wrestling at the may @entity6 executive board meeting			1
meanwhile , on the message boards of @entity176 , the official website of @entity11 , posters were calling the @entity6 decision the death of the sport in the @entity25 " you know what this means it is dead			2
what reasons do universities now have to keep programs that are not revenue sports that are not @entity190 , " wrote one			0
" the day of reckoning has arrived for our beautiful sport			0
what a sad , sad course of events , " wrote another			0
but at least one poster saw some logic in the @entity6 's popularity reasoning and pointed at mixed martial arts , the combination of boxing , wrestling and martial arts that is drawing legions of new fans			1
" it 's time to join forces with mma , because of its growing world wide popularity , and secure our growth and future as an essential part of its makeup			0
if we do not make this connection , we present ourselves as a single , fringe sport on the outside of popular " culture , one poster wrote			0
the host city for the @entity221 will be chosen in september			0
@entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 are the finalists			0
@entity0 's @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 contributed to this report .			0
