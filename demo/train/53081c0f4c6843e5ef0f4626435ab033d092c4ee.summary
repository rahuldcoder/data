-- he 's broken nearly every bone in his body in one of the most exacting all sports -- on the way setting records for jump racing that many predict will never be surpassed -- but thursday saw @entity11 's @entity10 reach a very special milestone			1
the 18 - time champion jockey made it 4,000 career winners when he rode @entity16 to victory at a meeting at @entity19 in central @entity20			1
the extent of @entity10 's longevity and domination of racing over the fences in @entity26 and @entity11 can be gauged by the fact that his nearest challenger , @entity28 , is some 1500 wins adrift of him			1
victory on the 6 - 4 favorite came in typical style , two lengths behind at the final fence before driving his mount home in the novice hurdle to beat @entity38 on @entity39 by half a length			0
it was also fitting that it came on a horse owned by the legendary @entity43 and trained by former @entity44 , a combination which has supplied many winners for @entity10			0
" it 's amazing , it could n't have worked out any better for @entity44 , @entity43 , the @entity51 have been so good to me , it was always going to be hopefully that i was going to ride it ( the 4,000th winner ) in @entity43 's colours , " @entity10 told gathered reporters			1
racing followers have been kept on the edge of their seats in recent weeks as @entity10 produced a steady stream of winners to close on the 4,000 mark and he went into the @entity19 meeting one short			2
@entity28 paid tribute to his rival for his incredible achievements			0
" he has completely rewritten what we thought was achievable in a season and a career , " he told @entity66			0
" he seems to get it right all the time and is a great ambassador for our sport , a true professional sportsman			0
" @entity77 became the first jump jockey to ride 1,000 winners in 1971 and his record was subsequently broken by fellow greats @entity82 ( 1,138 wins ) , @entity84 ( 1,678 ) and @entity85 ( 1,699 ) before @entity10 got to work in 1992 with his first winner at the age of just 17			1
many flat racing jockeys in other countries have notched up more winners than @entity10 , but their careers are generally longer and do not put themselves at risk of heavy falls that are a feature of jumping over fences under @entity97 rules			2
@entity10 , who won a prestigious @entity99 award in 2010 , is showing no signs of slowing up and bookmakers are offering odds of as low as 6 - 1 that he will reach 5,000 winners before he retires .			0
