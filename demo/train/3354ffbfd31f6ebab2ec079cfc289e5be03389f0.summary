-- for palaeontologists , the @entity1 has long proven a bit of a blind spot			2
evidence of dinosaurs has proven scarce , and what little surfaces from time to time have been traditionally difficult to itemize			1
that changed recently when an international team of scientists uncovered the first evidence of dinosaurs in @entity12 near the coast of the @entity14			1
the findings were published last month in the scientific journal @entity17			2
" to say that finds ( in the @entity19 ) are rare is an understatement			0
what 's been discovered , you could almost fit inside a shoebox , " notes dr. @entity21 , a palaeontologist at @entity23 in @entity24 , and the study 's lead author			2
" the problem in the past is that what 's been found are just bone fragments , and you can say they 're dinosaur , and vaguely what kind , but we 've been unable to reconstruct and assemble them			2
this is therefore the first time that we can confidently identify an @entity19 dinosaur fossil with any degree of accuracy , " he says			2
@entity21 and his team uncovered 72 - million - year - old fossils			1
the first was of a series of vertebrae from the tail of a " @entity57 - like " sauropod called a titanosaur , the second , a few teeth from a theropod			1
the latter belonged to an abelisaurid -- a bipedal carnivorous dinosaur some 20 feet long			1

" they had found an accumulation of fossils that mostly were n't from dinosaurs , but rather giant marine reptiles , " he says			2
as it happens , much of the @entity19 was underwater when dinosaurs roamed the @entity76 , and those rare remains that were discovered were washed downstream and out to sea by rivers , probably during a flash flood long ago in the @entity81			1
" we systematically worked this area over the last few years in the hope that a dinosaur would turn up			0
it was a matter of time to be honest ; dinosaurs do often turn up in marine rocks washed out to sea , " he says			0
" there are a handful of blank spots on the dinosaur map , and the @entity19 is among the very biggest blank spots , " notes dr. @entity91 , a palaeontologist and researcher at the @entity93 in the @entity94			0
in 2008 , @entity91 led a team that unearthed the first dinosaur tracks found in the region near @entity103 , @entity104			1
" even the tiniest scrap of bone is something to get excited about , " he says			0
" the picture is slowly filling in , but it 's a very large area and there remains much more to be discovered			0
" @entity112 , a vertebrate palaeontologist and professor at @entity115 , explains that the discovery could also help find much sought - after answers about the history of the @entity76 and its land formations			1
@entity112 explains that when the fossils were first buried , @entity12 was part of @entity122 -- the subcontinent that made up the southern half of @entity125 , and included parts of modern - day @entity127			1

but it passed by the @entity19 about the time that dinosaurs lived , " explains @entity112			0
" part of the interest in dinosaurs from @entity12 is to get at that relationship between @entity122 and @entity130 during that time			1
" several factors explain the scarcity of dinosaur - related material in the @entity19			1
one issue is that the richest sites are n't always the most accessible			0
fragments have previously been found in @entity148 ( currently a no - go zone ) and @entity104 , which discourages certain travelers			0
meanwhile , visitors to @entity12 need a sanctioned invite			2
@entity21 notes that in @entity12 part of the problem is that the most prevalent types of rocks are n't the right types for capturing millennia - old land - based animals			1
he also notes that until recently , the country suffered from a lack of interest in this type of research			0
" let 's say the geological view has been skewed in the past towards oil exploration , " he says			0
still , he says , paleontological research is gaining more traction , as evidenced by the government - run @entity169 recently adding a palaeontology division			0
" for the first time , you can see the work is going somewhere , and leading to a lasting legacy			0
in the future , we can expect to see @entity12 dinosaur displays and museums so people inside the country can understand the riches they possess			1

an international team of scientists discovered the first evidence of dinosaurs in @entity12
among the fossilized findings were the teeth of a carnivorous abelisaurid -- a 20 - foot tall bipedal dinosaur
scientists also uncovered the fossilized vertebrae from the tail of a " @entity57 - like " sauropod called a titanosaur
experts say the new evidence could reveal more about the how the @entity76 was formed
