-- as @entity4 approaches , the question on everyone 's lips is : what will the first lady be wearing ? glitz , gowns and government bigwigs will all be on display at monday 's parade of inaugural pomp and circumstance			1
president @entity13 will be ceremonially sworn into his second term in office by @entity17 chief justice @entity16 around midday			0
after the daytime events , which will include the inaugural address and parade , the president and first lady @entity23 will end their night by taking to the dance floor at two inaugural balls			1
while the formal events bring out their fair share of celebrities , media mavens , and the just - darn - lucky citizens who scored tickets online , there will be only one belle of the ball : the first lady			1
lessons in style from @entity23 behold one of the most prized traditions of the inaugural season : the wait for the dress			1
the hype around the inaugural ball gown is the closest thing this side of the pond to a royal wedding gown , and it 's approached with the same gusto			1
" there has always been an interest in what the first lady is wearing			2
photographs and descriptions of the inaugural gown and who designed it have been news for decades , " said @entity54 , the curator of the @entity56 's @entity55 at the @entity57			1
" sometimes sketches and descriptions of the dress and even formal photographs of the incoming first lady wearing the dress were released in advance to newspapers , " she said			2
after all , it is typically the country 's collective first impression of the first lady			2
mr. president , who are you wearing ? monday evening , the president and first lady will attend the commander in chief 's ball , which honors service members and their families , a tradition started by former president @entity84 ; and at the @entity85 , the president and first lady will celebrate with people around the country who bought tickets to attend			1

she did n't reveal who or what she would be wearing until she stepped out that night			0

" when we look at the gown that @entity124 wore 50 years ago , or the one that @entity126 wore more than a hundred years before that , it really takes us beyond the history books and the photographs , and it helps us understand that history is really made by real live people , " said the current first lady at the unveiling of her gown in march 2010			2
she continued : " the detail of each gown -- the fabric , the cut , the color -- tells us something much more about each single first lady			1
it 's a visual reminder that we each come from such different backgrounds , from different generations , and from different walks of life			0
" @entity54 said @entity113 , @entity124 and @entity144 in particular captured the look and feel of their eras -- the early ' 50s , ' 60s and ' 80s , respectively			0

" it was a sparkling pink creation , made with 2,000 rhinestones			0
" first lady pink " soon became a popular color choice for ladies of the decade			1
while @entity113 was quintessential 1950s , @entity124 went signature ' 60s with a gown by @entity163 of @entity164			2

a chiffon overlay covered an encrusted , off - white strapless bodice ( wearing strapless couture without some sort of covering was considered @entity173 © at the time )			0
meanwhile , @entity144 's hand - beaded gown by @entity150 couturier @entity176 cost $ 22,500 and oozed the @entity178 glamour that she and her actor - turned - politician husband brought to the @entity117			0
it 's a given that no matter how handsome president @entity23 might look in his tuxedo at the galas , all eyes will be on his companion			2
