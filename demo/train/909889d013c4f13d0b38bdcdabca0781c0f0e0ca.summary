off the coast of @entity1 -- on board the @entity4 , the captain has just had them execute what on land would be considered a three point turn			1
the huge frigate churns up the ocean as it neatly swings back around to its starting point ship and to an abrupt -- and complete -- stop			2
this is not what you 'd expect from a gigantic naval warship , but this is no ordinary boat			2
the @entity18 is one of the most advanced ships in the world			1
the average ship cruises along at roughly 9 miles an hour			0
with a 46,000 horsepower engine it can get to top speeds from a standing start , outrunning and surrounding its targets in a manner designed to make those on board think twice about putting up too much of a fight			1
the @entity22 is at what 's been described as the sharp end of @entity35 , @entity36 's counter-piracy mission in the waters off of the @entity38			1
commander @entity39 , the @entity22 's skipper , sees his high - tech ship as a very modern solution in the fight against an age - old problem			1
" keeping the pirates at bay , keeping them ashore is the first key issue			1
we can sit on the pirate camps and prevent them from coming out , and if they go out we disrupt them			0
" @entity35 began life in 2008 as a @entity54 - mandated mission to escort @entity56 ships through the @entity57 , one of the busiest waterways in the world			1
it later evolved into its current iteration , helping to drive down the frequency and success of piracy attacks			0
but it has n't been easy , and @entity39 has a tinge of respect in his voice when he speaks about the pirate 's capabilities			1
" they have been building up tactical procedures and we have seen that they are fantastic sailors , and now that we can come very close to shore , i 've seen with my own eyes how they can negotiate the big waves along the coast			1
" " they are well organized and they can easily put up an attack group , with the necessary money to do so and to get the men , " he added			0
one of the ways the @entity22 's technology has helped is by taking much of the guesswork out of a potentially hostile approach			1
the ship is equipped with an infra - red camera , which has a range of at least seven miles			0
" we can see right into the small craft , we can see faces on people , " said @entity92 , the @entity22 's executive officer			2
" we can see what they have in the craft			0
is that fishing gear ? we can see ladders , are there a lot of weapons on board ? " " if we do have a pirated ship and we 're doing an approach , trying to free the hostages or at least take back the ship , we can see who 's actually in charge because you can follow the different people around the ship			2
" the @entity18 is one of four ships involved in @entity35			1
the @entity114 , an @entity116 ship , acts as the floating headquarters for the operation and a base for admiral @entity120 , the commander overseeing @entity35			1
the @entity114 hosts joint training exercises to help build the pirate - fighting capacities of regional navies			0
we watched @entity126 sailors looking on as the @entity114 marine unit rappelled from helicopters suspended over the flight deck			0
this is what a hostile approach must look like for the hostages on a pirate craft -- goggle - wearing marines in camouflage snaking down suspended ropes before fanning out across the ship with guns cocked as the chopper 's blades whip up the air and the sea			2
at least 212 crew members of various ships were held hostage by pirates off the @entity38 in 2012			1
and while another 60 have been held so far this year , @entity120 believes @entity35 is starting to turn the tide against the seaborne criminal gangs			1
" right now the last hijacked ' unit ' was in may last year , " @entity120 told us			0
" there are some attacks but with no success and we 've captured pirates who are in jail awaiting prosecution , so the situation seems to be going in the right direction			2
" the huge amounts being spent here may be paying off , but piracy still effectively acts as a tax on every good coming through these waters			0
many commercial operators now pay on board security contractors , and those that do n't must cough up for the extra fuel expended in navigating around the pirates ' operating zone , which is an area the size of @entity171			2
another option is a costly wait to be transported by @entity36 ships through the so - called " @entity175			1
" but admiral @entity120 is optimistic that through the involvement of regional partners , a sustainable -- not to mention cheaper -- solution can be found			0
" two years ago the international community paid more than $ 12 billion to face this problem ; last year we reduced this amount to $ 7 billion and only a small part of this is related to governments , to the military			0
" but @entity120 is clear that to truly defeat piracy once and for all in the @entity38 , the key lies in @entity190			1
" we 've been successful at sea , but of course the roots of the problem are on land			0
in the last ten years this has been , we could say , the only ' job ' for many young @entity190 , the only way for them to work somewhere			0
" " any activity that will help train @entity190 in order to stabilize their country will help bring about a final solution			0
" for now though , the gains made at sea remain reversible			0
" as long as we 're here we 're putting on a strong pressure , and it would be @entity207 ve to think that if we leave that all would stay peaceful " @entity208 said			0
" that 's not the case			2
the funding [ for pirates ] is there and they would be able to launch pirate attack groups very shortly			2
