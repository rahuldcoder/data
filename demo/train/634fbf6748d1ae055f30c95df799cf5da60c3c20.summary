the support from @entity1 is significant because it could come at a cost to the group itself			2

@entity5 , speaking in @entity29 , said that all @entity6 factions would need to support such a bid before making the decision to go to the @entity7			1
the @entity33 are not currently under the jurisdiction of the @entity7 , but would be if they sign the court 's @entity35 , the treaty that established the court			1

the @entity43 and @entity4 , among some other nations , have pressured @entity5 not to take this step , arguing that it would harm peace talks			1
@entity1 ' announcement comes a day after one of the group 's leaders admitted that its militants were responsible for the abduction of three @entity4 teens in the @entity53 in june			1
@entity55 member @entity54 added that the kidnappers did not tell their leaders about the action			0
the kidnappings were not approved by @entity1 leadership or its military wing , he said , stressing that this acknowledgment does not equate to a claim of responsibility			2
" we at @entity1 head command were not aware of this mission ; we found out later , " @entity1 said in a statement saturday			0
" we at @entity1 political command do not know anything about the kidnapping ; all information we have is from the @entity4 investigation			1
but if this is true , this mission is considered self defense against the @entity4 occupation			0
" the three teens were later found dead			0
since then , violence has flared in the region			0
the violence continued saturday , as rockets fired from @entity83 landed in @entity4			2
the rocket alerts in @entity4 communities near @entity83 were continuous			0
the @entity1 rocket attacks struck in the same area where a 4 - year - old boy was killed friday			0
@entity4 claimed that the mortar that killed the boy was launched from a school operated by the @entity91			0
on saturday , the @entity92 said that @entity4 retracted that statement			0
the agency criticized @entity4 media for repeating the claim without checking with them first			0
" @entity92 deplores the killing of all children during this conflict , including the killing of the four - year - old @entity4 child yesterday and the hundreds of @entity6 children killed since the start of the current fighting , " the agency said in a statement			1
" we call on all parties to ensure protection and care of children affected by armed conflict , in accordance with their obligations under international law			0
" also on saturday , @entity118 , a tv station run by @entity1 , reported that @entity4 gunboats sank a @entity6 fishing vessel off the @entity121			1
a rocket from @entity123 struck an open area east of the town of @entity126 in northern @entity4 , though it was n't clear who was responsible or if it had anything to do with @entity4 's fight with @entity1			2
no injuries or damage were reported , said @entity4 @entity134 spokesman lt. col. @entity133			0
six decades of war @entity83 's zoo animals caught in crossfire @entity4 jailed for refusing to serve @entity0 's @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 contributed to this report			2
