@entity0 's rich generally have better schools , tidier parks and more trees			0
but are their neighborhoods also more likely to be mapped by @entity6 ? that 's the question two readers asked after i published a series of stories on @entity12 , @entity13 , which i called " the most unequal place in @entity0 , " based on its extraordinary level of income inequality			1
the readers noticed something i had n't : the rich side of @entity20 , which is the largest town in the parish , is mapped in detail by @entity23 ; the poor side is n't			1
" after reading i your article , i wanted to see where this @entity20 in @entity13 is			0
so i went to @entity6 map and found it , " wrote @entity27 , a 63 - year - old in @entity29			1
" then i decided to look at the town through @entity6 street view to see the houses there but i was surprised to find that even @entity6 discriminates against poor			1
they have the street view of most of the northern part of the town but very little on the south side though the south side has more streets			1
" " i found it interesting that @entity6 did not drive thru the streets on the south side like they did on the north side , " another person wrote			1
" maybe i am viewing in wrong but it appears that even @entity6 divided the area			1
" so why map the rich side and not the poor ? i have all sorts of guesses , but @entity6 is the only one with answers			1
unfortunately , the company was n't much help			0
" we try to cover as many streets as possible but occasionally we miss the odd one or two -- for example there may have been road work that day , a street may have been inaccessible or simply because of human error our drivers may have missed a street , " a @entity6 spokeswoman said in an e-mail to me			1
" it 's also possible that we did drive a certain street , but discovered that when processing the imagery , the photographs collected did not meet our high quality imagery standards due to unforeseeable challenges like shadows , poor visibility conditions , etc. " hopefully we can come back and photograph it at a future date			0
because i do n't particularly buy those arguments			0
the odds that an entire side of the town -- a small town , sure , but still a town -- would be under construction or would be photographed during an extreme weather event strikes me as implausible			2
the streets on the poor side of @entity20 are generally narrower and harder to navigate than those on the north , so maybe that had something to do with it			1
maybe fear is a factor			0
perhaps the driver taking these images did n't want to drive through the poor side of town with cameras tacked to his roof			1
maybe it was racism , since the poor side is largely black			1
or maybe @entity6 prioritizes areas based on the number of businesses there or the number of times @entity106 users search for addresses in that zone			2
those are just theories , of course , and @entity111 , a @entity6 spokeswoman , said none of them are accurate			2
@entity20 was last mapped in 2008 , she said , and it is unclear why the driver mapped one side of town and not the other			1
the region , and @entity13 as a whole , are less mapped than the company would like , she said			0
" it was n't for any reason about the demographics or anything like that -- or it being a poor area , " she told me			2
" that does not factor into our decisions in any way to map areas			0
we 're constantly updating this imagery and we 're constantly trying to make it as accurate as possible ... we want the whole world to be mapped , that 's our eventual goal			0
we want people to be able to explore different areas			0
" and maybe i 'm being unfair by raising this line of questioning			0
@entity6 is a private company , even though its services , including maps , have started to feel so important that they 're almost like public goods			2
it would make sense in a profit - minded way that they would provide @entity23 in places where it 's most needed or most likely to be used			2
that 's probably the reason only select parts of @entity152 are mapped with @entity23 , while much of @entity0 and @entity153 are			1
( i asked @entity6 what percentage of the @entity156 is mapped with @entity23 and have not received a response ; the company would say @entity23 is available in more than 3,000 cities and 54 countries , plus the @entity162 and @entity163			1
@entity23 cars have driven more than 6 million " unique miles " since the project kicked off in 2007 , the company said )			2
technology costs money , and people with money tend to drive the development and deployment of tech. plus , @entity20 is just one little place , one example floating in an ocean of data			0
you can search street view in the @entity181 and the south side of @entity183			0
in 2011 , i wrote about a fascinating photography project called " a @entity185 " that used @entity23 to highlight poverty			2
that project includes @entity6 - sourced images of poor neighborhoods in @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 and elsewhere			1
@entity111 told me @entity6 added @entity23 functionality to @entity199 in @entity200 earlier this year			1
so , there are poor neighborhoods on @entity23			1
but it is somewhat amazing to me that in this one little town -- the one that happens to be the most economically divided in the country -- the divisions extend into the very way the place is mapped			2
maybe that has real implications for life there , and maybe it does n't			0
it 's certainly easier to find a new place if you can take a digital look at where you 're headed			0
it may matter more for how outsiders , like those who e-mailed me , see the town			0
but the symbolism is what gets me			0
part of @entity20 -- a substantial part , which includes the public high school and some businesses -- is missing on @entity23			2
the digital version of @entity20 , in that sense , is like the real world : its poverty is hidden			0
is that true in your community ? take a look and let me know .			0

readers notice the poor side of a town is n't mapped with @entity23
@entity247 asks whether there is a trend with mapping and income
@entity6 : " we try to cover as many streets as possible "
