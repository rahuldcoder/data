-- a fixture of the presidential race has been @entity4 's 47 % problem : those @entity5 who do n't pay federal income tax that @entity4 has described as freeloaders			1
of course , @entity4 has retracted his remark			2
but if he still wants to attack those who freeload off of @entity5 taxpayers , there is a better target : our wealthy overseas allies			1
forty - seven percent is also roughly the @entity5 share of global military spending			1
our annual $ 700 billion - plus military budget exceeds the next 10 biggest military budgets combined			1
much of that money buys forces needed to defend allies against threats they could afford to meet themselves			2
alliances that once served the @entity5 national interest have become a subsidy to rich allies			1
in a recent foreign policy speech , @entity4 noted that only three of the 28 @entity32 allies meet their commitment to spend 2 % of their gdp on defense			1
he promises to fix that by asking our allies to honor their commitment to security spending			2
but the @entity41 have grown adept at keeping a straight face while ignoring such lectures			0
if @entity4 wants them to do more , he should suggest giving them less -- a logic he appreciates in domestic contexts			1
the same would apply to the @entity48 , @entity49 and various others we defend			0
some allies , especially in @entity53 , might increase military spending			1
others , noting less danger and bulging debts , may not			0
@entity58 is not the best judge of others ' needs			0
but with fewer commitments , we can maintain fewer forces and lower future military costs , which means more savings for @entity5 taxpayers			1
as long as the @entity5 bears the lion 's share of global defenses , our allies have little incentive to do more			1
as we saw in @entity73 in 2011 , the @entity72 enabled @entity32 's intervention by providing air refueling , intelligence and precision strike capability			0
our combat - tested @entity78 and @entity79 are the envy of their counterparts around the world , many of whom they train			0
our special operations forces track terrorists everywhere			0
@entity4 complains that our @entity88 has fewer ships than before @entity90 but fails to mention that it is far bigger than any other fleet and is the police force of the global seas			2
@entity4 has insisted that @entity5 exceptionalism compels us to steady alliances , settle regional disputes and forcefully promote democracy everywhere			1
but he has reversed the idea of @entity5 exceptionalism			2
early @entity5 leaders thought that the nation 's virtue lay in liberal values and the example @entity5 sets			2
for them , @entity5 exceptionalism had nothing to do with military adventurism			1
permanent allies might drag us into others ' disputes , imperiling liberalism by centralizing power in the presidency and requiring a massive military establishment			2
similar worries encouraged president @entity116 's push to keep our commitments to allies temporary			0
in 1953 , @entity119 and @entity48 were still recovering from @entity120 and @entity49 , with our help , was still fighting the @entity122 and its @entity124 allies			0
@entity5 commitments to defend those nations came from fear that the @entity128 would capitalize on their weakness , through conquest or internal intrigue , and gather enough strength to threaten us directly			2
those allies long ago grew rich enough to defend themselves , and the @entity128 has been history for decades			2
the @entity138 collectively has a population and economy larger than ours			0
but while @entity5 spend about $ 2,700 per capita annually on the military , @entity32 allies average around $ 500			1
more than 20 years after the end of the @entity145 , @entity41 sit in cafes while over 80,000 @entity5 service personnel still help guard @entity119 against @entity149 , which now has a gdp around the size of @entity152 and @entity153 combined			0
sixty years after the end of @entity156 , nearly 30,000 @entity5 forces still shield the @entity49 against a @entity158 neighbor with a 25th of its wealth and half its population			0
we have almost 50,000 troops in @entity48 almost 70 years after its surrender			0
@entity48 spends only about 1 % of its gdp on its military , provides no troops to help stabilize @entity168 , but insists that @entity5 @entity79 defend their every rocky island in a possible dispute with @entity124			1
@entity4 still has time to change his mind on this issue			0
rather than lecturing our allies about their responsibilities , we should kick them off the dole , rescinding commitments to their defense and removing troops from their shores			0
this is a problem that any president faces , including president @entity184			0
but @entity4 may make the problem worse through his proposed increase in military spending			1
if that seems chintzy , remember that there is virtue in economy and that we have needier causes at home , starting with the deficit			0
that tack might also prove politically useful : polls show that @entity5 would prefer to do less for rich allies			1
and foreign freeloaders ca n't vote			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 and @entity201 .			1

@entity200 , @entity201 : our annual military budget is large
@entity200 , @entity201 : @entity4 should suggest less military spending on our allies
they say our allies are rich enough to defend themselves instead of *relying* on the @entity5
@entity200 , @entity201 : lower military costs will mean more savings for @entity5 taxpayers
