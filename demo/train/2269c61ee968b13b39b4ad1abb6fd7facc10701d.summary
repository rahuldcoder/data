-- western intelligence missed a chance to capture or kill the suspected terrorist thought to be behind the @entity5 mall massacre , according to a former informant for both the @entity7 and the @entity9 intelligence service			1
@entity10 , who worked as an informant for five years , had forged a close relationship with the man -- a @entity14 called @entity15 -- who has been responsible for planning attacks inside @entity14 for @entity18			1
storm , a @entity9 national , told @entity0 that in march 2012 the @entity9 intelligence agency @entity20 had offered him one million @entity9 krone ( $ 200,000 ) on behalf of the @entity7 if he could lead them to @entity15 , the target of an unsuccessful operation by @entity24 last month			1
the @entity24 raided an @entity18 compound at @entity26 on the @entity28 coast , but @entity29 escaped			2
@entity30 's told @entity0 it is possible he might have got wind of the plans had he still been working for @entity35 intelligence			1
but his relationship with @entity20 and the @entity7 ended in mid- 2012 amid disagreement about a different mission in @entity39			1
" i get really frustrated to know that @entity29 had been maybe involved in the @entity41 terrorist attack			2
it frustrates me a lot because it could have been stopped and i 'm sad i ca n't be involved in this			0
" the @entity7 refused to comment on @entity30 's claims ; a spokesperson for the @entity20 told @entity0 : " we ca n't confirm or deny ever knowing @entity10			1
" @entity14 counter-terrorism sources have told @entity0 they believe @entity29 had a hand in the @entity41 attack as well as a string of plots targeting @entity14 in the last two years , including a plot to target @entity14 's parliament in late 2011			1

in the spring of 2009 @entity30 met @entity29 in @entity5 again			2
@entity63 , a senior @entity18 operative , had sent @entity29 to meet @entity30 to pick up electronic equipment for one of @entity18 's leaders			1
what @entity29 did not know was that @entity30 was working for @entity20 , @entity68 , and the @entity7 , and that tracking devices had been hidden in the equipment , which included a laptop			1
the equipment , according to @entity30 's @entity18 handlers , was for @entity74 , one of the senior planners of the 1998 bombing of the @entity78 embassy in @entity5			1
several months later @entity74 was targeted and killed in a @entity24 operation			0
storm 's @entity18 contacts subsequently told him they believed @entity74 had been tracked through the electronic equipment but blamed a junior courier			1
after @entity18 carried out a twin suicide bombing attack in @entity85 , @entity86 in july 2010 @entity29 told storm it was now difficult for him to travel to meet him in @entity5			1
from then on the two kept in frequent touch through encrypted emails -- which @entity0 has seen -- providing @entity35 intelligence with real - time information on his movements and plans			0
in early 2010 @entity30 connected @entity29 to @entity97 , the @entity78 - @entity39 cleric who had by then begun overseeing @entity99 's operations against the @entity100			1
according to storm the two then began communicating over encrypted emails			0
they eventually came up with a joint plan of action to attack the @entity100 : @entity29 would send @entity18 recruits , including @entity100 , to @entity39 for terrorist training , and they would then be sent back to @entity28 or on to the @entity100			1
" and as for going to hooks [ @entity97 's ] place ... then i was told by hook that they want to train brothers and then send them back or to the west , " @entity29 wrote to storm in november 2010			0

" he was one of the smartest ones i met in east @entity124 , " he told @entity0			0
storm told @entity0 that @entity29 helped oversee an intelligence apparatus -- " @entity126 " - @entity18 set up in @entity14			1
" he 's the main link between @entity28 and the @entity128 back here in @entity14 , " one of @entity15 's former associates told @entity0 in @entity5			1
@entity132 is a militant outfit in @entity14 closely associated with @entity18			1
storm said that @entity29 was at the center of a spiderweb connecting terrorist operatives in @entity28 , @entity14 , @entity39 , and the @entity100			2
he said he had emerged as the chief handler of foreign fighters , including westerners joining @entity18 , placing him in a unique opportunity to plot terrorist attacks in @entity124 and @entity143			2
his intelligence , language skills and connections appear to have now made @entity15 invaluable to @entity18			2
two former friends of @entity15 -- including a former member of @entity18 , told @entity0 he was now a strategist and planner for the group , rather than a fighter			2
" he 's part of the intelligence team			2
he speaks five languages - @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity28 , and @entity161 - and that puts him in a front seat with @entity18 , " one of his associates told @entity0			2
storm and the two former associates have shed light on how a middle class @entity14 became one of the most wanted terrorists in east @entity124			2
read more : suspicion over @entity158 's roll in mall attack @entity29 , now believed to be in his late twenties , was born in @entity174 into a middle class ethnic @entity28 family who also had blood links to the @entity179 tribe in @entity39 , a connection which later helped @entity29 forge a relationship with @entity99			0
the family moved to @entity5 when he was young where he excelled in his studies , especially in @entity184 and other languages			0
his friends remembered him as not particularly religious and fond of smoking marijuana			0
he moved to @entity187 in 2004 apparently to seek out economic opportunities in @entity143 , taking advantage of the fact that his @entity28 ethnicity allowed him to apply for refugee status			0
he was granted temporary travel papers , but he never fit in , and started to become radicalized			0
a 2006 offensive by @entity196 troops to rid @entity28 of the @entity197 , an @entity198 militia that had taken control of much of the country , appears to have played a significant role			0
storm said @entity29 had told him he had joined the @entity197 in @entity28 and experienced the invasion by @entity196 troops first hand			0
he suspects the experience instilled in @entity15 a deep commitment to @entity208			0
according to his friends when he returned to @entity187 he was told his application for asylum had been rejected , and he moved to @entity211 for several months			0
in 2008 @entity29 left @entity143 for good and returned to @entity124			0
western counter-terorrism officials fear his reputation in @entity215 circles worldwide will be bolstered by his escape from the @entity78 operation , and he may be emboldened to plot new attacks			0
" @entity18 will protect him to the end			0
they will give him bodyguards around the clock they will make sure he is safe where ever he goes in @entity28 , " one of the former associates of @entity15 told @entity0			0
