-- scientist and conservationist @entity2 has spent 20 years protecting @entity4 's endangered mountain gorillas in war - torn @entity5			1
today he is the director for the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , the first @entity4 to be appointed			1
but it has not been an easy task			2
in his quest to preserve the mountain gorilla , @entity2 has faced persecution , death and has seen a number of his colleagues killed during one of the worst ethnic conflicts of the 20th century			1
@entity2 first became involved with mountain gorillas in 1990 , when he worked as a plant researcher for the @entity20 , in @entity21 , @entity5			1
it was during this time a rebel group calling themselves the @entity24 attacked the country			2
@entity2 was arrested as a tutsi and persecuted			1
released in 1991 , he fled to @entity27 , lucky to escape with his life , he told @entity0			1
he lived in exile for three years and at the end of the 1994 genocide , @entity2 returned home determined to protect the mountain gorilla and its natural habitat			1
but he was unprepared for the devastation his country had suffered , and returned to find his entire family , including his mother , father and three brothers dead ; slaughtered during the genocide			0
speaking of the genocide , @entity2 said : " @entity5 was devastated			1
you would see the bodies of dead people , thousands of people			0
the whole country had to resume from scratch			0
my attention went to the national park , " he told @entity0 in order to save the mountain gorilla , his goal was to maintain and preserve the national parklands			0
but after so many years of war the environmental degradation was extensive			2
extremist militia groups and government officials continued to fight in the parks			0
this was perhaps the most dangerous time for the conservationists , with a number of park rangers and guides killed , either by the numerous land mines scattered along forest paths or caught in the cross fire of the warring factions			0
but it was the mass movement of refugees that was the greatest threat to the regions ' mountain gorillas			0
forced from their homes , they swarmed into national parks on an unprecedented scale			0
the sheer numbers of displaced people could have spelt the end for @entity21 , but it was @entity2 's persistent efforts and intense lobbying that ensured huge areas of wildlife were preserved , as the country struggled to resettle more than two million people			1
today things are looking brighter			0
@entity2 and his team are at the forefront of eco-tourism , with the money they make going towards the preservation of mountain gorillas and the neighboring communities near the parks			2
not only has @entity2 helped to save the endangered mountain gorilla , but his conservation tactics are now used in other war - torn regions struggling to preserve their wildlife			2
for his tireless efforts , @entity2 was awarded the @entity106 in 1996 , the @entity107 in 2001 and recognized as a @entity108 in 2007			1
