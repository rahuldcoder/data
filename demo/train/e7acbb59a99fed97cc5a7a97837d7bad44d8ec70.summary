@entity0 , who held numerous posts in the @entity3 regime since the 1970s , was considered the country 's second-most powerful man			1
then , the most powerful man , @entity3 leader @entity6 , had him executed			1
@entity0 's death sent ripples through the isolated nation not just because of his influential position , but because he was the uncle of @entity6			1
in the two years preceding his death , @entity0 held one of the most powerful posts -- regent to the young @entity3 leader			1
he was instrumental in the nation 's transition from former leader @entity17 to his son and heir , @entity6			0
the secretive nature of the @entity3 regime makes it a challenge to deduce why @entity0 fell out of favor , though one expert sums it up this way : @entity6 outgrew his guardian and took him out			1
those who agree with this hypothesis look at @entity0 's trajectory throughout his decades in the regime			2
at least twice before , @entity0 was purged from the leadership presumably for his too - big ambitions			2
@entity17 purged @entity0 in 2004 and he was virtually unseen for two years before making a comeback			2
if his ambitions got the best of him again ( the @entity3 say he was guilty of treason ) , this time , there will be no comeback			0
@entity0 , who was married to @entity6 's aunt , was vice chairman of @entity3 's top military body and had often been pictured beside the young leader , who is believed to be around 30			1
but in a lengthy article foaming with outraged rhetoric , @entity3 's official news agency on friday accused @entity0 of trying to overthrow the state , describing him as " despicable human scum			1
" analysis : @entity3 execution raises more question than answers @entity0 's ascent @entity0 , 67 , was born in northeastern @entity3 and was the youngest of five children , according to the respected @entity56 blog			1
he studied economics , and it was during university that he met @entity60 , the daughter of @entity3 leader @entity61 , and sister of @entity17 , who would succeed his father			0
the couple got married , giving @entity0 an inside track to some of the country 's most powerful posts			2
among his many positions , @entity0 was the director of the administrative department of the ruling @entity71 , chairman of the country 's commission for sports , and vice chairman of the @entity77			1
" over time he accumulated a lot of influence within the party central committee , " said @entity78 , a @entity3 expert at @entity79			2
although not related by blood to the ruling family , his influence came from his reliance on his wife , @entity78 said			1
but analysts say @entity0 had a big ego and was arrogant , leading to his being removed from his positions at least twice			0
according to @entity78 , in the late 1970s , @entity0 was stripped of his post and sent to work at a steel mill , but succeeded in returning to the party ranks			0
@entity0 reportedly fell out of favor a second time in 2004 , when he left the leadership ranks and disappeared from public view for about two years			0
in the last two years , @entity0 extended his influence from the administrative centers of @entity3 to the economic side , @entity78 said			1
he began accumulating authority over the economy , social life , foreign investment and foreign trade			0
opinion : how @entity6 got rid of his uncle @entity3 transparency ? one of the more surprising developments following the execution of @entity0 was the lengthy indictment of his alleged crimes and his character that was published by the state media			1
for the regime to so openly explain why it executed him , it could hint at @entity0 truly having overstepped his bounds			2
" this man has always been a little more individualistic and embracing capitalism and lifestyle that is not acceptable to @entity3 , " said @entity116 , a professor of international affairs at the @entity118			2
whatever @entity0 did to betray @entity3 , it was so severe that his wife could not , or would not , help spare him			1
" i think she is more loyal to the party than @entity0 is , " @entity116 said			0
she may have even consented or participated in prosecuting her husband , he said			0
to the outside world , the transition of power from @entity17 to @entity6 appeared smooth , but the revelations made in the indictment cast a different light on the change in power			0
the fall of @entity0 is evidence that there was resistance and tension behind the scenes during these past years , @entity78 said			0
it may turn out that @entity0 was building his own power base , growing his own cult of personality , he said			0
in the end , @entity0 may have underestimated the younger @entity6 , thinking he was a kid who could be manipulated , @entity78 said			0
in the end , @entity6 outgrew his regent and took him out , he said .			0

@entity0 was considered @entity3 's @entity150
he was executed , @entity3 said
experts say @entity0 was an ambitious man whose wings had been clipped before
his influence came from his marriage into the ruling family
