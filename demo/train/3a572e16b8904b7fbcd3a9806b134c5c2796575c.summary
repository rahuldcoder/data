mangled limbs wrapped in blood - stained rags were strewn across rooms in the school			0
run by the @entity6 , the building was meant to be a refuge for more than 3,000 civilians fleeing the deadly conflict raging between @entity10 and @entity11 in @entity12			1

it 's the sixth time a facility run by the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) has been struck in the current conflict , intensifying questions about the tactics being used by both sides in areas crowded with civilians			1
" people who go to these places expect that they go there because they will be safe , " said @entity45 , the commissioner - general for @entity38			0
" and here is the confirmation that it appears that there is nowhere where you can be safe			1
" ' such horror ' the @entity6 said it thinks the rounds that hit the school , in the @entity58 refugee camp in northern @entity12 , were fired by @entity10 artillery			1
the @entity10 military said it is reviewing what happened , acknowledging that it exchanged fire with militants in the area			1
@entity6 @entity66 ban ki - moon condemned the attack			2

" the coordinates of the school had been repeatedly communicated to the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) -- as recently as 8 hours before it was hit -- the @entity6 said			1
lt. col. @entity80 , a spokesman for the @entity79 , said that the @entity10 were aware of the people sheltering at the @entity6 building and that " they were in no way or form a target			1
" " we have n't ruled out that it was a @entity11 mortar that landed in the premises , " he said			0
but the @entity6 pointed the finger at @entity10			1
" based on initial elements we have clear indications in the first assessment that three projectiles hit the school , and on analyzing the shrapnel we believe we have all the elements in place to conclude it was @entity10 artillery fire , " @entity45 said			1
schools hit before the deaths in the @entity58 school are far from the first time @entity38 facilities have been dragged into the current conflict , which has killed more than 1,300 people in @entity12 , most of them civilians			1

sixteen people were killed last week at a different @entity6 shelter in northern @entity12			1

no weapons have been found in @entity6 schools that have been sheltering people or that have been under the control of the @entity6 , according to @entity168 , operational director of the @entity6 @entity169			2
the shelling of the @entity58 school has intensified criticism suggesting @entity10 is n't doing enough to avoid civilian casualties in its operation aimed at stopping @entity11 rocket fire and taking out the militant group 's underground tunnel system			1
" if the strike on this school was the result of @entity10 artillery fire it would constitute an indiscriminate attack and a likely war crime , " said @entity178 , director of the @entity179 and @entity181 program at @entity73			1
" @entity189 should never be used against targets in crowded civilian areas and its use in such a manner would never be considered a ' surgical ' strike			0

" ' safe zones not combat zones ' @entity80 of the @entity79 accused @entity11 of exploiting civilians and humanitarian organizations			0

" but @entity10 is coming under increasing pressure to improve its efforts			2

" @entity223 spokeswoman @entity222 backed up the call			0
" @entity11 is taking steps here that put civilians at risk			0
but we do believe the @entity10 need to do more , " she said			0
