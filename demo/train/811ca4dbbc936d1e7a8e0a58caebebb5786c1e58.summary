ever the gentleman , nothing could stop @entity2 from escorting his wife , @entity3 , on her greatest journey			2
he lovingly watched their children crowd around their mother to say goodbye			2
suddenly , @entity3 stretched her arms , smiled as if she were a blushing bride , lay down on the bed and died			2
@entity2 , though , had died five years earlier			0
legend has it that when @entity3 , the mother of @entity15 founder @entity14 , died in 1917 , her husband came back to escort his wife to the great beyond			0
according to the @entity2 family , the butler saw the late master walking down the stairs and out the front door of their stately @entity23 , @entity25 , home , appearing young , handsome and happy			0
it 's one of many ghost stories told around the city of @entity23 , where centuries - old cemeteries and antique houses betray a bloody history of battles , fires , epidemics and storms -- a supernatural tourist delight			1
@entity37 was even born on october 31 , 1860 , on @entity38			0
but @entity37 's childhood home , a beloved @entity41 destination , does n't seem creepy at all			0
photos capture how scared you look inside a haunted house @entity45 , the interim director for the @entity46 , is quick to mention its bright , happy feeling			1
the stone facade and double - staircase entry , blessedly shaded from the hot @entity25 sun by oaks and hanging moss , looks like the destination for a grand ball , not a big scare			0
" i always think of haunted houses being unwelcoming or scary , " @entity45 said			1
" that 's certainly not what this house is like			1
" so why have columns , turrets , widow 's walks , mansard roofs and gingerbread trim of @entity68 - styled houses -- not to mention overgrown grounds , @entity71 moss and cobwebs -- become the hallmarks of spooky , sinister places ? to start , all those details signal that a house has history			1
" with old houses of any style , especially those that have been in the same family for generations , more than likely , there will be legends , " said @entity78 , a professor emeritus from @entity80 's department of art history , who researches haunted houses			1
" these historic houses , especially the beautiful ones , embody what it is we feel that we 've lost			1
" and they 're a living reminder of a time when ghost stories took on greater meaning			0
early architecture in the @entity101 drew on popular @entity103 styles from @entity104			2
as the country grew , neoclassical homes incorporated columns and pediments better known from ancient @entity109 , the bed of philosophy and political theater			2
later still , @entity101 @entity68 homes borrowed romantic architectural elements from @entity116 churches of @entity117 and castles of @entity119			1
as all those styles became fashionable , the early founding fathers were dying			0
residents of a young @entity101 feared they were losing their sense of morality along with them , said @entity126 , an @entity101 history professor at @entity127			2
this national anxiety , along with a strong tradition of folklore and ghost stories , led to radical ways of thinking about the dead that rejected the limits of the scientific method			0
some believed that spirits of the dead not only existed in our universe but were able to understand it better than the living			0
by the 1840s and ' 50s , stories of ghostly communiques were making headlines in newspapers around the country			0
through seances , self - proclaimed " spiritualists " sought wisdom and advice from the dearly departed			0
they were , for the most part , progressive middle - to upper - class people , @entity126 said , who owned fine homes that might still be standing today			2
legend has it that @entity162 rifle heiress @entity161 was haunted by the deaths of her child and husband when she sought guidance through a spiritualist			2
she went on to build a sprawling @entity68 home in @entity169 , @entity170 , perhaps under the guidance of a medium -- or perhaps because she was an enormously wealthy widow with a home - building hobby			1
either way , the home -- now a tourist attraction -- became an architectural testament to turmoil			0
in the years @entity162 was building , there was nothing farfetched about ghost stories or the idea that houses could be haunted , said @entity126 , the history professor			1
" back in those days , religious belief -- especially the physical reality of the afterlife -- was more widespread than it is today , " @entity126 said			0
" there was no reason for these folks to deny or disbelieve that spirits actually existed			0
" of course , @entity194 and @entity195 @entity193 - style houses did n't start off sinister			0
" at the time they were built , they were fashionable , trendy and modern , " said @entity196 , the art historian			1
but the taste for such houses vanished in the 20th century , she said , and elements of @entity68 architecture gradually gained a dark aura			1
few were wired for electricity , and they hardly suited modern tastes for light , efficiency and ease in cleaning			0
people began to look at @entity68 houses as unsanitary , gloomy and dark , @entity196 said			1
even the architecture itself gained a mongrel reputation because of its appropriation of historical styles -- @entity116 , @entity218 , @entity109 -- mixed together in what seemed like an incoherent and disorderly manner			1
the @entity221 was especially susceptible to that attitude as once - grand @entity224 homes stood empty after the @entity225 , dilapidated to the point of ruin			2
loaded with architectural elements that had fallen out of style , @entity221 homes were " burdened by a history of violence , whether it was family violence or the violence of the slave system , " @entity196 said			1
" there 's almost this wholesale rejection of the @entity68 style , which is thought to be literally unhealthy for people because of the darkness and gloom , " she said			1
pop culture helped to seal the deal on what seems spooky			2
think of the home from " @entity247 , " and the dark room filled with @entity249 and rotting lace where @entity252 ' mummified mother sat , or the stately manors of " @entity254 " or " the @entity255			0
" even @entity256 turned to the @entity68 to create the fa√ßade of @entity259 's famous @entity258			1
the wrap - around porches festooned with @entity262 - style wrought iron , massive columns and pediment and crowning turret recall the houses of the coastal @entity221 , @entity196 said			0
( indeed , even that home is rumored to be the final resting place of a departed soul			0
) so no matter how many haunted homes break from tradition , there 's always something chilling about just the right spooky style			1
" i love a @entity68 house , " @entity196 said			1
" it makes me wonder where the bodies are buried			1

*victorian* homes have developed a spooky reputation
*paranormal* history and architecture trends combine to create a haunted feel
