-- @entity2 's government is facing rising religious violence in the north , a long - simmering separatist movement in the oil - rich south and now a nationwide strike fueled by widespread anger over the end of fuel subsidies seen by many as one of the few benefits of living in the largely impoverished state			1
the issues , all intertwined in @entity2 's complicated web of political , ethnic and religious relationships and rivalries , add up to a difficult challenge for the government of president @entity23 , who just a few days ago promised a renewed focus on economic , fiscal and education reforms in 2012			1
" @entity23 is a president under fire			1
his actions over the last week are that of a desperate president , " @entity2 political journalist @entity28 said			1
particularly curious , @entity2 analyst @entity32 said , is why @entity23 would choose now to resurrect the @entity2 government 's repeated efforts to scuttle the fuel subsidy , which is highly popular with the country 's 155 million residents -- many of whom live on less than $ 2 a day			1
" one would have thought that in an area of heightened religious conflict that the last thing you would want to do is provoke a general strike , " said @entity32 , a senior fellow for @entity40 with the @entity41			0
read more about what is behind @entity2 's fuel protests whatever its reasons , finding a way out will be a trick for the government , he said			1
if the government backs down and restores the subsidy , it may appear weak to northern militants and southern separatists , @entity32 said			2
if it tries to wait out a strike in hopes that the protests will disintegrate , it risks a crippling disruption in the flow of oil , which provides 95 percent of @entity2 's foreign exchange and 80 percent of its government 's budget			1
read more about @entity2 protests over the end of the fuel subsidy " the government finds itself , i think , in an extraordinarily difficult situation , " @entity32 said			1
until the @entity76 announcement by @entity23 's government that the country would end fuel subsidies that held down the cost of gasoline for @entity2 's 155 million residents , perhaps the largest immediate crisis facing the administration was the religious violence in the north			1
more than 30 @entity88 died in violence last week in @entity90 , prompting a 24 - hour curfew in that northwestern @entity2 state to guard against @entity94 reprisals , a government chaplain said saturday			1
@entity95 , a shadowy militant @entity96 group that is said to favor strict @entity98 law , is frequently blamed for the sectarian violence			0
the attacks came several days after the government declared a state of emergency in several areas as @entity23 pledged to continue fighting to quell the violence			1
" while we have made progress and overcame most of the challenges on many fields , there have been those amongst us who want to impose their will on the majority of us			0
" he said in a @entity115 's message			0
" this government will lead @entity2 and @entity2 to resist such imposition			1
" but @entity23 , who took over as president two years ago after the previous president left the country to be treated for a heart problem , has not earned high marks for his handling of the issue , @entity28 said			1
@entity23 's recent revelation that @entity95 sympathizers may have infiltrated the government is particularly vexing , he said			1
" @entity2 find it outrageous to hear him say about his government , which he had a major part in putting together , that there are @entity95 sympathizers within it , " @entity28 said			2
" people would like to know who they are and what efforts are being made to prosecute them			0
" @entity23 has done better at managing the fallout from sporadic attacks on oil facilities in the @entity140 region , @entity28 said			2
a group called the @entity142 , or @entity142 , has claimed responsibility for some of those acts out of frustration with how the country 's oil wealth is distributed			0
searing anger as @entity2 protests fuel price rise @entity2 is the world 's 10th largest oil producer , according to the @entity153			1
but little of the money oil brings in comes back to residents of the @entity157 region , @entity32 noted			0
and government plans to embark on a building program in the @entity161 - dominated north , along with threats of reprisals against @entity161 over the killing of @entity88 , threaten to inflame tensions in the south and reopen wounds from the country 's civil war in the late 1960s , @entity32 said			2
that conflict left as many as 3 million people dead			0
such concerns prompted prominent @entity2 authors , including the 1986 @entity175 winning playwright @entity174 , to issue a statement urging calm			2
" the fears we have all secretly nursed are coming to realisation			0
" said @entity174 , novelist @entity181 and poet and playwright @entity182			0
" rumblings and veiled threats have given way to eruption , and the first cracks in the wall of patience and forbearance can no longer be wished away			0
@entity95 is very likely celebrating its first tactical victory : provoking retaliation in some parts of the nation			0
" against the backdrop of these issues , along with @entity2 's staggering poverty and critical infrastructure issues , @entity23 announced last week that the government was ending a fuel subsidy , saving nearly $ 7 billion a year , according to the government			1
the money is being redirected to a wide - ranging infrastructure construction program , additional social spending and economic initiatives , the government said			0
but those plans did n't salve the pain for many @entity2 , who responded explosively to the proposal , which is the latest in a series of failed efforts dating back decades by the @entity2 government to eliminate the popular subsidy			1
" we still do n't have light , " travel and tourism business owner @entity214 told @entity0 last week			0
" the roads are terrible			0
it was already hard to live in @entity2			2
this will make life even worse			0
" protests quickly morphed into a call for a general strike by trade unions , which have not enjoyed particularly strong support in @entity2 despite low wages and poor working conditions , @entity32 said			2
those strikes succeeded in shutting down wide swaths of the country , according to union and media accounts			0
in some places , police clashed with protesters			0
much of the anger has to do with a sense that @entity2 elites are not sharing in the sacrifice @entity23 says is necessary to move @entity2 forward , @entity28 said			1
in fact , protesters have adopted the " @entity249 " moniker that has characterized protests against what protesters consider to be greed on the part of corporations and the very rich			0
" with the fuel subsidy , he has put the cart before the horse and has not assured @entity2 that the austerity measures that have been imposed on them are being shared by the those who rule the country , " he said			1
" the sheer cost of running the government is draining @entity2 's fortunes			1
" in a january 7 speech , @entity23 said elimination of the subsidy was a tough but necessary choice for the country 's economic future			1
" i am determined to leave behind a better @entity2 , that we all can be proud of			2
to do so , i must make sure that we have the resources and the means to grow our economy to be resilient , and to sustain improved livelihood for our people			0
we must act in the public interest , no matter how tough , for the pains of today can not be compared to the benefits of tomorrow , " he said , according to a transcript posted to his @entity273 page			0
@entity32 said he was still mystified at the decision to suddenly resurrect an issue that has dogged the @entity2 government for decades			2
" but whenever you 're dealing with @entity2 , there 's a lot you do n't know , " he said			2
@entity284 leaders vow to keep up the pressure on the government indefinitely , saying in a statement on the @entity289 website that " the will of the @entity2 people must prevail over that of any government in power			2
@entity295 reported from @entity296 ; @entity297 reported from @entity298 .			0

@entity2 's president is under fire for his government 's elimination of a popular fuel subsidy
