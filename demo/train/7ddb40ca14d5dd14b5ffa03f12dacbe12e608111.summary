@entity0 -- calling it " the biggest change to @entity11 since the introduction of the @entity13 , " @entity3 ceo @entity2 on monday unveiled an operating system for iphones and @entity7 that will radically overhaul how users ' touchscreens look			1
the new system , @entity14 7 , was part of a two - hour presentation that included refreshed @entity17 , the announcement of an @entity20 streaming - music service and a sneak peek at a new @entity22 that will be the most powerful computer @entity3 has ever made			1
the keynote , kicking off @entity3 's annual @entity24 , marked @entity3 's first major product event in nine months			1
but it was short on blockbuster launches or surprises -- no tv , no smartwatch and no upgrades to marquee products like the @entity13 and @entity7			0
some pundits griped about a lack of groundbreaking hardware or features at a time when @entity3 is facing a stock - price slump , increasing competition from rivals like @entity41 and a gnawing perception that the giant computer company is not as bold or as cool as it was under @entity44 , its late ceo and co-founder			1
instead , developers assembled for the weeklong conference got the first look at a major reworking of @entity3 's mobile operating system , due this fall			1
@entity11 is home to more than 900,000 apps that collectively have earned independent developers $ 10 billion , according to @entity3			1
the mobile design , overseen for the first time by new @entity11 boss @entity56 , includes new typography , redesigned icons and a new color palette			2
" i think there is a profound and enduring beauty in simplicity , in clarity , in efficiency , " @entity56 said in a video introducting @entity14			0
" true simplicity is derived from so much more than just the absence of clutter and ornamentation			0
it 's about bringing order to complexity			2
" immediately noticeable : the pool - table green background on @entity74 was gone			2
" we just completely ran out of green felt , " joked @entity75 , @entity3 's vice president for software engineering			1
in fact , virtually every recognizable app shown in a brief presentation looked considerably different from its @entity82 counterpart			0
animations float by in the background of the @entity86 app , while @entity87 is now minimalist in black and white			0
but it 's not just a redesign			0
@entity75 demoed new features like @entity91 , where users will be able to swipe up for music , flashlight and other tools			0
airdrop , @entity3 's file - sharing software , comes to mobile with @entity14 , and the @entity100 app has been upgraded with such features as @entity103 - like photo filters and photo albums that can be created by year or location			1
@entity106 , @entity3 's voice - activated " digital assistant , " is becoming more diverse			1
users will be able to choose a male voice -- @entity106 has been solely a " she " so far -- and users can ask it to perform basic tasks like playing a voicemail or turning down the brightness on an @entity13 or @entity7 's screen			0
@entity14 became available in beta to developers on the @entity13 monday , but the rest of us will have to wait until the fall			1
it will work only on @entity13 or later , @entity7 2 and later , the mini and the @entity123			0
also coming this fall is @entity20 , a free streaming service that sounds a lot like @entity127 or @entity128			2
@entity20 will include over 200 programmed channels , plus others inspired by music the user already listens to			2
the service will be ad - supported and will encourage users to buy songs they like from @entity136			0
however , @entity20 joins a crowded streaming - music landscape -- @entity138 launched a similar service last month -- and several analysts criticized it as a rare example of @entity3 playing catchup to its rivals instead of creating something new			1
also monday , @entity3 introduced revamped @entity17 with " all - day battery life " and offered a peek at the most powerful computer the company has ever made			1
@entity3 senior vice president @entity149 provided a peek at the new @entity22 , a desktop that is @entity3 's fastest computer			1
in a teaser video , the new @entity151 looked like a shiny cylinder and , according to @entity149 , will double the performance of the current model , launched three years ago			1
" ca n't innovate any more , my ass , " @entity149 told the audience in a jab at analysts who have said @entity3 is being surpassed by companies like @entity41 and @entity138 in the rollout of bold new products			2
the new pro will be released this year and will be designed and assembled in the @entity164 , @entity149 said the 11 - inch version of the @entity166 will go from five hours to nine hours of battery life , @entity149 said , while the 13 - inch version will go from seven hours up to 12			2
@entity149 said the new models will have faster @entity171 connections and faster graphic loads			0
they began shipping monday , with the 11 - inch @entity166 beginning at $ 999 and the 13 - inch starting at $ 1,099 ( that 's a $ 100 break on the 13 - inch )			1
in a departure , @entity3 's next @entity177 operating system will not be named after a cat			1
instead , the 10th iteration of @entity181 will be called @entity182 , named for a popular surfing spot in northern @entity184			0
( previous version names have included @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190			0
) among the system 's new features will be maps , previously a mobile - only product , and ibooks , which will let users read books they buy from the @entity198 on multiple devices			1
other features demoed by @entity75 included color - coded tags , a multidisplay setup for more than one screen and integration with @entity205			0
he said internal tweaks have been made to make the system faster and to conserve battery life			2
the new system will be available in the fall			0
in opening the keynote , @entity2 noted that the company 's online @entity198 has served up 50 billion downloads in its five years of existence			0
he said there are 900,000 apps in the store , 375,000 of which were designed for the @entity7			0
" just a few hundred from those other guys , " he said , in an apparent swipe at rival tablets that run @entity138 's @entity223 system and others			2
he also said the @entity198 has 575 million accounts , " more accounts with credit cards than any store on the internet that we 're aware of			0
