-- last month a small pocket of marshland in @entity3 , @entity4 , was saved from development			1
the local online newspaper , the @entity7 , celebrated the preservation of @entity9 -- named for a leading authority on the larvae of surf clams - and its populations of kingfishers and fiddler crabs			1
this week , @entity3 , on the shore of @entity17 , was pulverized by @entity18			1
homes were turned into debris fields ; boats were tossed into the marshes or piled on top of each other			1
one quiet ceremony , one catastrophic storm			1
both symbolize a national dilemma , as the headlong migration to @entity31 's coastlines clashes with rapidly changing climate patterns and more powerful storms			1
experts warn of superstorm era to come @entity17 typifies what has happened along the @entity37			1
in 1970 it had 208,000 inhabitants ; in 2010 there were 576,000 , according to census data			1
that made the cost and extent of the damage inflicted by @entity18 much greater			1
nationwide , the scale and speed of the rush to the coast has been stunning			1
according to @entity52 , the population of coastal shore - line counties will reach 133 million by 2020 , compared to 33 million in 1980			1
much of the development has occurred in coastal communities most vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms			1
according to @entity62 data , the coastal populations of states from @entity59 to @entity60 grew 244 % between 1950 and 2006			1
opinion : @entity64 , i 'll miss you they are even higher in the summer months with the influx of tourists			1
one - quarter of all seasonal or second homes are in coastal @entity72 , and more than 60 % of homes and buildings within 500 feet of the shoreline are on the @entity77 and @entity78 coasts			2
as population density has grown and land values risen , the preservation of natural features has become more difficult			1
@entity83 was saved thanks to a 1.2 cent tax that the people of @entity17 approved in 1997 to preserve open spaces			2
it also helped that it adjoined the @entity89 , a federally funded sanctuary of marshes , barrier islands and bays			2
the reserve is a natural sponge -- like the mangrove swamps in the @entity78 -- for absorbing storm and tidal surges			1
and officials with @entity100 , which runs the reserve , say it coped well with @entity18 's onslaught , despite a storm surge of 6 feet			1
@entity4 coastal town turned to " devastation " but such havens are a rarity on the @entity109 , and there are only 28 estuarine reserves across the country			2
coastal development projects , meanwhile , continue apace			2
just last week , a $ 100 million resort development was announced for @entity116 , a few miles from the coast on the @entity119 - @entity72 border			2
the site , adjacent to an estuary , will occupy 575 acres and include a hotel , conference center , water adventure park and movie complex			2
it also may create as many as 800 jobs			2
the importance of tourism to employment and the tax base of many coastal communities makes for fierce arguments pitching the science of sea - level rise against development			2
@entity138 's senate recently voted to ban the state from using projections from its own science panel on sea - level , which forecast a rise of 39 inches by 2100 , in development decisions			2
instead it approved a much lower calculation of 8 inches			2
the vote , advocated by 20 coastal counties , was subsequently overturned			2
the searing experience of @entity18 , following @entity150 , @entity151 and other major storms in recent years , will likely raise more questions about the wisdom and scope of coastal migration and development , especially as many climate scientists expect the intensity and size of storms to increase , and their geographic reach to extend northward			1
the construction of roads and buildings has encroached on coastal forests and wetlands			2
half of @entity31 's coastal wetlands have been lost , the majority over the last 50 years , according to a federal advisory committee that reported in 2009			2
on the @entity77 , the average erosion rate is 2 to 3 feet a year ; in the @entity78 , 6 feet			2
the forecast rise in sea level , water temperature and acidity is likely to damage more coastal habitats			1
the @entity178 @entity37 is made more vulnerable by the fact that the coastline is gradually sinking			1
but is there any way to mitigate the effects of development ? new satellite data reveals sea - level rise forty years ago , @entity187 passed a law called the @entity189			2
it empowered @entity100 to preserve and where possible restore the natural features of the @entity178 coastline			1
the @entity194 in @entity17 , @entity4 , was one of the areas funded by the act			0
the program has spent about $ 1 billion of federal money to acquire and run these reserves , but that 's a sum dwarfed by the damage inflicted in just four hours this week			1
according to a 2010 report by the @entity203 , some two - dozen initiatives in @entity187 to increase funding for the program have been rejected			0
states have begun introducing laws that require setbacks for construction to take account of erosion			0
they also have been establishing commissions on climate change to advise on building regulations and zoning			1
@entity100 has joined with local communities to explore the impact of development , using the estuary reserves as educational tools			0
but a federal advisory committee that reported in 2010 warned : " it is clear that there are limits to how much adaptation can achieve ... in the future , adaptations will be particularly challenging because society wo n't be adapting to a new steady state but rather to a rapidly moving target			1
" @entity233 might be described as ground zero of this phenomenon			0
it has lost 500 islands in three centuries , at least a dozen of them inhabited , as the coastline has sunk and the sea level risen			0
two years ago , the last house on what had been @entity245 crumpled and slipped beneath the waves			0
a century ago the island had nearly 400 residents			0
scientists from the @entity250 in 2008 said that during the 21st century carbon dioxide concentrations in the bay could increase by between 50 % and 160 % ; sea - level could rise between 0.7 and 1.6 meters , and water temperature by 2 to 6 degrees @entity255			0
opinion : climate change is real they stressed that we are in uncharted territory and much will depend on the level of co2 emissions -- and the future of development			1
but the @entity233 's delicate ecosystem will undoubtedly be affected , with its vital eelgrass at risk and cold - water species vanishing			0
some are already observed to be retreating north			0
rather than the health of eelgrass , it 's likely that hard cash and cold fear will influence human behavior			0
as coastal communities have become more crowded , so the cost inflicted by hurricanes , storms and storm surges has risen exponentially			1
the 1926 hurricane that hit @entity282 caused about $ 76 million in damage at today 's prices			1
in 1995 , @entity285 , which was no bigger , inflicted $ 17 billion in damage , according to figures from @entity100			1
insurance companies have taken flight -- for example , pulling out of many coastal areas in @entity72 , where the state is now the insurer of last resort			0
total government exposure to storm - related losses in coastal states has risen more than 15-fold since 1990 to $ 885 billion last year , according to the @entity298			0
the @entity300 insurance group says @entity31 has seen higher losses from extreme weather than any other part of the world in recent decades			1
not all had to do with coastal events			0
but a year like 2005 ( which included @entity150 , @entity307 and @entity308 ) comes with a price of $ 60 billion in insured losses			1
that 's the sort of number that drives up premiums			0
in a report last month , @entity300 said : " a main loss driver is the concentration of people and assets on the coast combined with high and possibly growing vulnerabilities			0
" @entity321 , which models catastrophic risks , recently updated its scenarios , anticipating an increase of 40 % in insurance losses on the @entity327 , @entity72 and the southeast over the next five years , and 25 % to 30 % for the mid-atlantic and northeastern states			0
those calculations were done pre-sandy			0
pockets of discontent among signs of recovery after @entity18 getting more people out of harm 's way is also a daunting challenge			1
as population density grows , so evacuation routes come under greater pressure			0
one out of @entity344 this week was blocked by a stranded houseboat			0
more powerful storm surges threaten a wider area farther inland			0
and while forecasting the track of hurricanes has improved dramatically , forecasting their intensity has not			0
@entity352 in 1995 went from a category 1 to a category 4 in just 20 hours			0
this week , many people in the coastal townships of @entity17 were stunned by the speed and force of the surge			0
one resident told @entity0 how the water level rose from a couple of inches to waist height within an hour			0
another recounted how a boat crashed into their porch , and then driven like a battering ram by the waters demolished their garage			0
in @entity373 , the owner of a marina said 50 of the 90 boats there had been scattered across the neighborhood			0
several homeowners lamented their lack of adequate flood insurance and their now tattered dreams of retiring to the shore			0
it 's a fair bet that many households along the northeast coast will purchase such insurance -- through the @entity386 -- in the coming months			0
after @entity151 the number of homeowners in the region with flood insurance rose from 5 % to 14 %			0
of the millions of people with jobs , businesses or vacation homes on the coast , or who just find the lure of the shore irresistible as a place to live , few will likely pack up and seek higher ground because of @entity18			1
but if the scientists are right , peace of mind might come at a premium			0
powerless in @entity4 @entity0 's @entity407 contributed to this report			0

migration to @entity178 coastlines clashes with rapidly changing climate patterns
growth means storms like @entity18 bring much higher price in damage
the preservation of natural features along coastlines has become more difficult
