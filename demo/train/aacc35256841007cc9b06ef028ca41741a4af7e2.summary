-- empires , wars and various ethnic groups have rendered the map of @entity5 a patchwork upon which dozens of countries and languages vie for space			2
a trip to every one of these nations is possible if you have endless weeks stretching ahead of you , but if you 're short on time , cash or motivation , you need to think smarter			2
that 's where border towns come in			0
where @entity5 's frontiers rub against one another lie cities in which diverse cultures clash and blend , creating places that showcase the best of all worlds			2
here are a few of our favorites			0
@entity31 , @entity32 border : @entity34 the food - loving @entity32 have long held the cuisine of their northern neighbors in contempt			1
some @entity32 expats even consider @entity34 a hardship posting , presumably because of their disdain for unpretentious menus of moules , fries and waffles			1
in return , beer - chugging @entity34 could be forgiven for mocking the wanting concoctions of water , yeast , hops and barley consumed to the south			0
( though , to be fair , @entity32 microbreweries are starting to make up for lost time )			1
no such concerns in the northern @entity32 city of @entity31			1
here traditional local restaurants combine the intricacies of @entity60 dining culture -- making extensive use of the region 's tasty maroilles cheese -- with the bold beer selections favored further to the north			0
at @entity70 ( @entity71 ; +33 328 364006 ; website in @entity32 only ) the beef in beer , and roast chicken in cheese , are worth the trip			1
the city also blends @entity75 with classical @entity77 architecture -- the art deco @entity79 ( 14 @entity80 ) is a prime example			0
and its @entity31 ( 18 @entity83 ; +33 3 20 06 78 00 ) has one of the best collections of classic art outside the capital			2
@entity87 , @entity88 @entity89 : @entity90 , @entity91 close to the border of both @entity90 and @entity91 , the proud capital of @entity88 has only recently emerged from a centuries - long identity crisis that still resonates around fairy tale streets that once charmed @entity95			1
@entity87 -- or as it has variously been known , @entity87 , @entity97 , @entity87 and , briefly , @entity98 -- was for 300 years the capital of the @entity100			1
meanwhile , its close ties with nearby @entity103 once saw the two cities share a tram line			0
it was also , until the " velvet divorce " of 1993 , part of the old @entity109			0
the reconstructed @entity110 ( +421 2 544 114 44 ) has been witness to most of this and is a good place to savor a city that 's enjoyed a unique place at the crossroads of central @entity5 , as well as the imperious views it commands over the nearby borders			0
traditional local cuisine is a hearty melange of dishes influenced by @entity90 and @entity91			0
@entity87 ( @entity123 382/4 ; +421 2 544 384 55 ) or @entity124 ( @entity125 cesta 257 ; +421 2 623 175 90 ) are both good options for food			1
@entity128 , @entity129 border : @entity131 another country - hopping city that continues to bear the imprint of its former occupants , @entity128 lies on the southern coast of what 's now @entity129 but was , until the 17th century , @entity131			0
the two nations are now umbilically connected by the majestic eight - kilometer @entity141 , which plugs @entity128 almost directly into the @entity131 capital of @entity143 and serves as a potent symbol of their close ties ( not least in the gripping @entity131 - @entity129 tv drama " @entity147 " )			2
you can still hunt for @entity131 influence in the buildings of @entity128 's @entity152 ( @entity153 ) , although it 's more fun these days to contemplate modern architecture , including the twisty @entity157 skyscraper ( @entity158 ; +46 40 17 45 00 ; website in @entity129 ) or the offshoot of @entity163 's @entity162 art collection , housed in an old electric plant ( @entity165 22 ; +46 40 6857 937 )			2
@entity131 still has something to offer though , as can be seen at the sublime @entity168 extension , designed by @entity131 architect @entity169 ( @entity171 vag ; +46 40 660 85 00 )			0
@entity172 , @entity173 border : @entity32 the sheer size of @entity32 , and its numerous borders , mean an inevitable reappearance in this list -- this time pushing its influence into @entity173			1
in @entity172 , just 20 kilometers south of the border , @entity32 's contribution can be seen in the city 's neat urban layout and the @entity185 architecture of its grand casino - turned - city hall and @entity188 theater ( @entity189 2 , +34 943 48 11 60 )			1
also , as more than one grumbling tourist has pointed out , in the prices that are typically higher than the rest of provincial @entity173			1
the @entity32 would also no doubt like to take credit for @entity172 's disproportionately large number of internationally rated restaurants			1
and although the surrounding @entity198 region does have its own strong culinary traditions , @entity32 fine dining has clearly made its mark at places such as @entity202 ( @entity203 ; 273 , +34 943 27 84 65 ) , among a trio of restaurants in the city to earn three @entity208 stars			1
@entity209 , @entity210 border : @entity212 while this @entity210 port lies close to the border of @entity212 and within striking distance of @entity218 , its heritage lies firmly within the same middle @entity5 empires that once laid claim to @entity221 , @entity103 and @entity222			0
and so from @entity210 we have operetta , piazzas ( the monumental @entity224 is one of @entity5 's largest ) and gelato , the latter being unsurpassed at @entity230 ( via @entity231 ; +39 040 30 05 24 )			0
from @entity103 we get literary salons of the kind that drew " @entity235 " author @entity234 to @entity209			0
most have now fallen by the wayside , but a recent campaign appears to have saved @entity234 's mahogany - lined favorite , @entity239 ( @entity240 , 18 )			0
and from @entity91 we get places like @entity242 , small eateries where pretty much everything on the menu contains pig , beer or pickled cabbage ( via della @entity249 3 ; +39 040 366 858 )			2
@entity250 , @entity251 @entity89 : @entity252 , @entity253 a chilly 400 kilometers north of the @entity254 lies @entity250 , a small @entity251 town located between the borders of @entity252 and @entity253			1
admittedly , there is n't much in @entity250 to influence -- for a lot of the year it 's too shrouded in gloom and snow to distinguish from other settlements in region			1
but as a visit to the @entity269 ( @entity270 31 ; +47 789 428 90 ) confirms , @entity253 revolutions , czars and @entity252 migrants have all left their mark			1
@entity250 is n't without its attractions			2
during the literally endless days of summer , the fjords and forests are worth exploring			0
winter brings spectacular displays of northern lights and the almost obligatory @entity279 ( @entity280 14 ; +47 789 705 40 )			0
there 's also a @entity253 market ( @entity283 ) on the last thursday of every month , where you can buy matryoshka nesting dolls as well as porcelain and , because apparently nothing says @entity253 like a pair of knitted toe warmers , socks .			2

too *rushed* , poor or lazy to tour the continent ? here are places to cut corners
the @entity298 capital of @entity87 was for 300 years the capital of the @entity100
@entity32 influence is prominent in @entity172 , @entity173
