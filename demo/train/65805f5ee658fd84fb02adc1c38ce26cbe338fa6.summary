homeland security secretary @entity12 said in a statement that he has directed the @entity14 to " implement enhanced security measures in the coming days " at selected overseas airports			1
" we will work to ensure these necessary steps pose as few disruptions to travelers as possible , " @entity12 said in a statement			0
" we are sharing recent and relevant information with our foreign allies and are consulting the aviation industry			0
" specific steps or airports were not disclosed			2
a homeland security official said that @entity14 would work with airlines and security agencies overseas and that the changes will primarily focus on airports in @entity6 and the @entity7			2
the effort does not involve changes to what travelers can take aboard flights			0
but passengers may see additional inspections of shoes and electronics , additional use of scanners designed to detect trace amounts of explosives , and another stage of screening at boarding gates , in some cases , the official said			1
the measures do not involve @entity5 domestic flights , and passengers could see changes as early as next week			2
the changes came about based on new intelligence on terror groups trying to build new types of improvised explosives that are harder to detect , the official told @entity0			1
there was no specific plot			0
the @entity61 @entity60 confirmed wednesday that it is stepping up some of its aviation security measures			1

the @entity5 has particularly been focused on efforts by @entity84 to develop undetectable explosives since the unsuccessful attempt by the so - called " underwear bomber " to bring down a @entity89 jet over @entity90 in 2009			0
