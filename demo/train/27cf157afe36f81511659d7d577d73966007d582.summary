@entity0 -- the @entity3 disaster is focusing attention on a problem that has bedeviled @entity0 policymakers since the dawn of the nuclear age -- what to do with used nuclear fuel			0
currently , spent fuel -- depleted to the extent it can no longer effectively sustain a chain reaction -- is stored in large pools of water , allowing the fuel to slowly cool and preventing the release of radiation			1
but events in @entity21 , where two of the six spent fuel pools at the @entity3 facility were compromised , have raised questions about practices at the nation 's 104 nuclear reactors , which rely on a combination of pools and dry casks to store used fuel			1
" i truly believe we must re-think how we manage spent fuel , " sen. @entity35 , @entity36 , said at a @entity38 appropriations subcommittee hearing wednesday			0
in @entity36 , @entity35 said , fuel removed from reactors in 1984 is still held in spent - fuel pools , well beyond the minimum five to seven years required by federal regulators			1
" it 's hard to understand why the @entity45 has not mandated a more rapid transfer of spent fuel to dry casks , " @entity35 said			1
currently , there is no maximum time fuel can remain in spent fuel pools , the @entity45 said wednesday			1
as a result , critics say , nuclear plants have made fuel pools the de facto method of storing fuel , crowding pools with dangerous levels of fuel , industry critics say			1
as of january 2010 , an estimated 63,000 metric tons of spent fuel was in storage at @entity63 power plants or storage facilities , according to the @entity45			1
" for the history of our nuclear power program , i would say , the storage of spent fuel ... has been an afterthought , " @entity65 , a physics professor at the @entity66 , testified			2
" i believe we should really start thinking hard about consolidated storage , presumably in federal reservations , to solve a host of problems			0
" the @entity45 and industry critics differed on whether spent fuel pools are safe			1
" spent fuel pools are considered ' safety significant ' systems , so they meet a lot of the same standards that the reactor itself would have to meet , " said @entity77 , chairman of the @entity45			1
" for example , the spent fuel pools themselves are required to withstand the natural phenomena like earthquakes and tsunamis that could impact the reactor itself			1
" @entity90 , a nuclear physicist with the @entity92 , disagreed			0
" at many sites there is nearly 10 times as much irradiated fuel in spent fuel pools as in the reactor core , " he said			2
" the spent fuel pools are not housed in robust concrete containment structures designed to protect the public from the radioactivity they contain			2
instead the pools are often housed in buildings with sheet metal siding like that in a @entity106 storage shed , " @entity90 said			0
" i have nothing against the quality of @entity106 storage sheds but they are not suitable to nuclear waste storage , " he said			0
a nuclear industry representative said the " lack of a national strategy " on waste storage is exacerbating the problem , since it does not know whether to place spent fuel in permanent , on - site containers , or containers suitable for transport			1
" we want to limit the number of times we have to handle used fuel			0
we want to be able to take it out of the pool once , put it in a cask ... not all casks are designed for transportation for example , " said @entity129 , a power company president speaking for the @entity130			0
@entity77 said spent fuel pools do n't endanger the public			2
" we do n't have a maximum time ( fuel can stay in the pools ) , " he said			0
" but we do analyze the fuel			0
( @entity140 ) goes through a very rigorous analysis to ensure that ( it can be added to the pool ) safely and securely			0
" a high - ranking energy department official , meanwhile , said a commission studying the issue of spent fuel will issue an interim report by july 29			2
the commission was formed after the @entity150 administration killed a plan to store nuclear waste at @entity153 in @entity154 .			0

events in @entity21 have raised questions about spent - fuel storage in the @entity63
the @entity63 has 104 nuclear reactors , which rely on pools of water and dry casks for storage
an estimate by the @entity45 said some 63,000 tons of spent fuel was stored in the @entity63
the @entity45 and industry critics disagree on whether spent fuel pools are safe
