-- as the curiosity rover begins its exciting trek across the surface of @entity4 and up the dramatic peak of @entity6			0
@entity8 it is important to realize that the plans for this great success were incubated and acted upon more than 10 years ago			2
exploration like this is not for the faint of heart -- it takes time and persistence			0
so what 's next ? what is in the funded pipeline now that will be revolutionizing our understanding of life in the solar system 10 or even 20 years from now ? the short answer is -- nothing			2
after @entity28 there is , at present , no other mission in production that will explore potentially habitable worlds beyond @entity33			2
but where do we want to go ? where do we hope we 'll be ? along with continuing our exploration of @entity4 there are several moons of @entity40 and @entity41 that we think might be good places for life			2
these moons -- worlds with names like @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50 -- are covered with solid water ice , beneath which we have very good reason to believe that vast liquid water oceans exist			1
and when i say liquid water i mean good old - fashioned @entity59 ; if you drank this stuff it would probably taste similar to a big gulp of salty ocean water from our ocean here on @entity33			1
these are oceans that exist today and have likely been in existence for much of the history of the solar system			2
why is this important ? well , if we 've learned anything about life on @entity33 it 's that where you find liquid water you generally find life			1
these moons have lots and lots of water and they could be great homes for alien ecosystems ( note that when i say " alien ecosystems " i 'm referring primarily to microbes and simple life forms			1
as much as i 'd love to discover creatures like those seen in the movie @entity85 , i 'll be happy just to find a considerable speck of a microbe ! ) one moon in particular -- @entity40 's @entity92 -- may have the perfect combination of liquid water and the chemistry needed for life			1
@entity48 is about the size of our @entity98 and beneath its icy shell @entity92 harbors a global liquid water ocean of roughly 100 km in depth ( by comparison , @entity33 's ocean has an average depth of 4 km and a maximum depth of 11 km )			1
the ocean of @entity48 contains about 2 - 3 times the volume of all the liquid water on @entity33			1
it 's an ocean that 's there today and has likely been in existence for much of the 4.6 billion years of our @entity115 's history			2
as such , @entity48 provides an incredibly compelling place to go to search for a second , independent origin of life and it 's a place where we might find lifeforms that are alive now , today			1
this is important for two reasons			0
first , we need to know if the origin of life is easy or hard			0
does life arise wherever the conditions are right or is it a rare occurrence in our @entity126 ? second , all life on @entity33 -- from microbes to man -- runs on the same fundamental biochemistry of @entity131 , @entity132 , and proteins			1
see also : the search for dark matter we want to probe the question of whether or not there exists another way to get the " business " of life done			0
is there another game in town beyond the biochemistry we see here on @entity33 ? by going to @entity48 we can address both of these fundamental questions			1
@entity4 may have once been habitable but on @entity4 we are looking for signs of life trapped in the rocks ( essentially molecular fossils of microbes )			0
in addition , @entity4 and the @entity33 are so close that asteroid impacts in the past might have seeded either world with life from the other			2
@entity48 is likely too far away for this kind of interplanetary " seeding			2
" more : what we 've done on @entity4 , and what 's next why do we even think that life could exist on @entity48 ? here 's where the exploration of our own ocean serves as an important guide			1
for much of human history we have focused on discovering new lands and exploring continents			0
for the most part , we 've only skimmed across the top of the ocean			0
but in the spring of 1977 explorers cruising the dark depths of our ocean discovered that active geological regions on the ocean 's floor -- known as hydrothermal vents -- were home to vibrant ecosystems of organisms large and small			1
these are ecosystems that thrive despite the tremendous pressure , and despite the lack of energy directly from the @entity191 the base of the foodchain down there is not photosynthesis but rather chemosynthesis , since the microbes are deriving energy from the chemistry of the hydrothermal vents fluid			0
the discovery of ecosystems in the deepest parts of our ocean is continuing to change our understanding of habitable environments here on @entity33 , and also of potentially habitable environments beyond @entity33			1
on @entity48 we expect that the temperature , pressure , and chemistry of the seafloor might not be that different from our own ocean 's seafloor			1
in the decades to come our pipeline of exploration must include rigorous exploration of our own ocean so as to better understand the fundamental geological and biological cycles here on @entity33			1
this research has the added benefit of feeding forward into our efforts to explore potentially habitable oceans in the far reaches of our solar system			0
but some may ask : why ? why do these things ? granted , this is not going to change the way you make your coffee in the morning			0
sure , there are spinoff technologies and many jobs created but that is not at the heart of why we do these things			0
the drumbeat of human civilization is the pursuit of new knowledge			0
we explore , we discover , and we advance			0
from fundamental research on cancer to revolutionizing our understanding of the universe , it is not an either / or : we must do it all			0
anything less is a sign that our priorities as a race have been hijacked by agendas beneath our potential			0
as has become a refrain in my community , the drumbeat continues and we echo the wise words of @entity257 : dare mighty things			0
read more about space and science on @entity0 's @entity262 blog the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity265 .			1

moons @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50 are covered with solid water ice
scientist @entity265 says there could be vast liquid water oceans *underneath* the ice
these oceans could be great homes for alien ecosystems , says @entity265
exploring @entity33 's oceans might help us understand fundamental geological and biological cycles
