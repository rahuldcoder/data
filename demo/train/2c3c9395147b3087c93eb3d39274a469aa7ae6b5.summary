with a single phrase , @entity0 , that friend of @entity1 's , may have lit a fuse in the trial of his accused killer			1
asked by the defense what @entity1 told her on the phone that night when he first spotted @entity11 , she testified a " creepy - ass cracker " was following him			1
there is nothing illegal about that			0
@entity0 said she did n't even know it was a racial slur , and numerous commentators have noted that some in @entity19 use the term in a non-derogatory , colloquial sense			1
but for plenty of rural , white southerners , " cracker " is a demeaning , bigoted term , and its appearance does nothing to help the prosecutors			1
the origin of cracker is murky			1
some sources suggest it came from overseers who commanded slaves			0
others say it derives from a @entity38 word for boasting			0
at @entity40 at the @entity41 , @entity42 says it emerged in the 1700s as a descriptive term for drovers who used small whips to move their livestock through the pine barrens along the @entity50			2
" they were basically poor people			2
a class of people who were landless			0
" initially , cracker was not a pejorative term , but @entity42 says it has become one , the equivalent of redneck			1
its meaning and intensity as an insult depends on who is saying it and who is listening			0
for example , a white who might not object to being called a cracker by another white might consider @entity1 's use of the phrase offensive and evidence of ill intent			1
in the circumstances described in court , @entity42 notes , it was more likely a quick way for @entity1 to say he was in danger			2
" if it is used by blacks ( among themselves ) , it is usually with one meaning : watch out			0
he did n't say it to @entity11			2
he said it to convey a message to a friend			0
he said , ' trouble is coming			0
' " still , even if @entity1 knew precisely what the term meant and said it with all the venom he could muster , does that matter ? maybe			1
under @entity19 's hate crime laws , @entity1 's words could potentially have been used against him had he survived the encounter and @entity11 had taken the worst of it			1
that may seem far - fetched , but a state handbook advises that a hate crime may have occurred " if the commission of ( a ) felony or misdemeanor evidences prejudice based on the race , color , ancestry , ethnicity ... " complicating the matter further : despite suspicions among many case watchers that @entity11 followed @entity1 largely because he was @entity114 , the only mention of race from the defendant in his call to the police that night about a " suspicious guy " came when he was questioned			1
" this guy , " the dispatcher asks , " is he white , black , or @entity122 ? " @entity11 responds , " he looks black			1
" where did the n - word come from ? all of this may seem pointless to people who focus on the central fact of this case : no matter how the conflict began , police say it ended with an armed man killing an unarmed one			0
the debate over cracker may furthermore seem arcane to people who live north of the @entity137 , where cracker is seldom heard , and even when it makes an appearance , it is not freighted with decades of history			2
to be sure , cracker is not on par with the n - word , but it is nonetheless a sharp racial insult that resonates with white southerners even if white northerners do n't get it			1
that said , ask @entity42 what impact the word will ultimately have on public opinions of this trial , and he is succinct			0
" i would say none			0
" views of justice , he says , are inextricably linked to racial attitudes			0
many blacks will see this trial one way , many whites another way , just as they did in the case of @entity164			2
but the broader public does not matter			0
what matters is the jury			0
and it is hard to imagine how it can help the prosecution for those six southern women to know @entity1 spent some of his final moments uttering a racial insult , no matter what he intended .			1

@entity1 's friend said he described @entity11 as a " creepy - ass cracker "
the term *injected* race into @entity11 's second - degree murder trial
" @entity186 " has a murky history but *generally* describes poor whites
the slur is *widely* considered an insult among white southerners
