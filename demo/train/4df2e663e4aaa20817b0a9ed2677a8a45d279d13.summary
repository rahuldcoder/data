-- it seemed innocent enough : two famous men running into each other at a public event by coincidence , exchanging pleasantries and small talk , and posing for a selfie later posted on @entity9			0
but the meeting between " @entity11 " actor @entity12 and @entity14 president @entity13 this month in @entity15 is at the center of a political controversy in @entity14 that caught both the @entity19 star and @entity14 government by surprise			1
@entity12 , who plays a president on the @entity24 series , posted the selfie with the @entity14 leader on may 7			1
" 1 president is real			0
good meeting a man also making progress in 1st year in office			0
@ @entity32 " was the caption on @entity9			0
the selfie was taken at @entity34 , an international tourism conference held in the beach resort of @entity15			1
tour operators and tourism entrepreneurs and companies from around the world as well as @entity14 officials and celebrities attend the event organized by the @entity14 government			1
the @entity14 president also posted a picture with @entity12 on his @entity9 account , although it was a more formal , sit - down meeting , with the two men talking and looking at each other			1
" it was nice to be with actor @ @entity53 , special guest of # @entity54 , last night in @entity15 , " @entity13 wrote on his @entity9 account may 7			1
" to fans of @ @entity57 , i 'm sorry , i ca n't give away details of the third season , " the president jokingly wrote later			2
he also retweeted @entity12 's selfie			1
controversy erupted may 12 after @entity14 columnist @entity62 wrote in the 24 horas newspaper that @entity12 had been paid $ 8 million by the @entity14 federal government			1
political analysts immediately started questioning whether the meeting had truly been " a coincidence " or a shameless , self - promotional ploy by the president , paid for by @entity14 taxpayers			2
@entity12 was the first to react to the storm of criticism in @entity14			2
" story about @entity74 paying 8m or any amount for selfie not true ! was in @entity78 event			0
meeting president not planned at all , " @entity12 tweeted may 16			2
he had earlier tweeted that his endorsement of @entity13 was not necessarily personal			2
" i guess nobody got the joke			0
i was in character as @entity84 in @entity11 , not myself ! i do n't know jack about @entity14 politics , " @entity12 said			1
@entity0 reached out to @entity14 officials for comment			0
in an e-mail , @entity89 , chief executive officer of the @entity90 , said that @entity12 was paid to appear at the tourism event but not to pose with the president			1
" @entity12 's participation at the @entity34 was part of the event 's general program			1
the @entity34 is self - financed through the sale of booths and entry fees			0
we also have sponsors through which tourism service providers finance some costs , " @entity89 wrote			0
@entity89 did n't specify the amount @entity12 was paid for his appearance but said the entire event had a cost of between 40 million and 45 million pesos ( almost $ 3.1 million to $ 3.5 million )			1
this and other explanations have done little to silence criticism in @entity14			0
a reader of @entity113 , the newspaper that originally reported the payment , cynically asked his fellow @entity14 to pay their taxes			0
" let 's not stop in complying with our fiscal obligations , " the reader wrote , " so that @entity120 can keep on paying his favorite actors			0
so many children on the streets and families without a job and he 's spending @entity14 's money in his ( expletive ) hobbies			2
