-- the 6 - month - old girl whose parents created a " bucket list " blog for their daughter after doctors said she would not live past age 2 died monday , her father said			1
@entity11 , who was born in november with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 , died of pulmonary complications related to the genetic disorder , @entity10 said on the blog tuesday			1
" in short , one of her lungs collapsed and she went into cardiac arrest , " said @entity11 , 31 , of @entity16 , @entity17			2
" i immediately performed cpr on her and was able to bring her back to life , but only for a brief period of time before she passed away shortly after arriving at the hospital			2
" @entity11 's passing this quickly came as a complete shock to all of us , as she had just been given a thumbs up at her last doctors appointment only three days ago , " her father wrote tuesday			1
" while we were aware of the severity of her diagnosis , we never lost hope for @entity11 and even in her passing , we still have hope for our daughter and all of her friends			2
" the infant 's parents had written the blog as though @entity11 would make it past age 2 and experience life 's milestones as a healthy girl			1
@entity11 wrote monday that there were two items he could now scratch off @entity11 's " bucket list " : 1			1
not let @entity56 take my smile away			0
take one last breath , then take one more before i go to live with my @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and all my great - grandparents			2
he published the last photo the parents took of @entity11 , which he said showed her " sitting on her mommy 's lap looking at me and all it took to get her to smile this big was for me to keep saying ' hi			1
' " the blog began as an efficient way to keep family and close friends in touch about their baby 's health			2
but when the father came upon the idea of writing a " bucket list " for his @entity11 -- a list of things to do before death , normally drafted for adults -- his blog went viral and now has 2.4 million page views			1
the " bucket list " is so sensitively penned that many of his readers are convinced that it 's mom , not dad , typing the entries , he said			1
" a lot of people , when they post on there , they say , ' you and your husband			0
' they obviously assume @entity106 is writing it , " he said			0
the bucket list 's entries are lighthearted , humorous and decidedly hopeful , though @entity11 had the worst order of an incurable disease caused by a genetic defect that attacks the muscles , especially the respiratory system			1
only type 0 is worse , but that usually occurs with fetuses , the couple said			0
one in 6,000 babies is born with one of four types of @entity56 , according to the @entity122 , whose daughter was diagnosed on @entity124			0
one in 40 people is a carrier of the gene , and the @entity129 had a one in 1,600 chance of both being carriers -- which they believe they are , the couple said			0
writing in the first person as if his daughter were the author , @entity133 created new bucket list entries during the week on the family 's averycan.blogspot.com website or their " @entity11 's @entity139 " @entity142 page			1
