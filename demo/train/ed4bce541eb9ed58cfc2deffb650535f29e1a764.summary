-- @entity1 , the surprise candidate of 2012 , has been struggling to survive accusations of sexual harassment			1
every day that the story continues and new accusations emerge , @entity1 's candidacy is at greater risk			1
yet thus far his polls have remained steady , and the news cycle seems to be turning toward other issues			0
@entity1 has denied the accusations and pushed back against the accusers			1
@entity1 is far from the first presidential candidate to struggle with a scandal centered on sex			1
sex scandals have a long tradition in @entity19 politics			1
in the presidential campaigns of 1824 and 1828 , opponents accused @entity22 of adultery , while in 1884 @entity24 lambasted @entity25 for his illegitimate child			0
supporters of @entity25 's opponent , @entity28 , liked to chant " @entity29 , @entity29 , where 's my pa ? " whenever they had a chance			2
during the first seven decades of the 20th century , sex scandals played a diminished role on the campaign trail			2
the news media exhibited remarkable restraint , as reporters stayed within boundaries defining what kind of behavior was appropriate -- or relevant -- to report and what was not			0
the rules governing behavior at the workplace were also extraordinarily lax , and reporters , like other @entity19 , did n't expect men to meet a high standard in treating the women around them			1
despite widespread knowledge of president @entity53 's sexual escapades and sen. @entity55 's alcoholism , reporters declined to write stories about their behavior			1
according to the legendary reporter @entity58 , a politician who chased after women was gently characterized as a man who appreciated a well - turned ankle			0
but that changed in the 1970s			0
a new generation of reporters , inspired by the @entity66 investigation , was eager to expose the next big scandal in @entity68			2
in recent years , the proliferation of news outlets , ranging from cable television to the @entity70 , has created intense competition to report the most salacious stories			0
public norms on sexuality have liberalized and the media have grown more comfortable reporting about sex			0
moreover , liberals argue that the private behavior of public officials matters			0
new sexual harassment laws have changed the norms of what is considered acceptable at the workplace			1
conservatives are more eager to highlight personal behavior as they hope to to make morality a legitimate issue in public debate			0
sometimes sex scandals have brought down promising candidates			0
during the 1987 @entity97 primaries for president , for example , the @entity94 reported that @entity99 , a former @entity100 senator , was having an affair with a young model			0
@entity99 challenged the media to prove their allegations			0
soon after , the @entity105 obtained photographs of a model named @entity108 sitting on @entity99 's lap on a yacht named @entity111			2
once the pictures were published , @entity99 dropped out of the race			0
yet often candidates have been able to survive these accusations			1
sex scandals are not necessarily devastating to a candidacy			0
during @entity123 's 1992 presidential campaign , allegations that he had had an affair with @entity121 broke right before the crucial @entity125 primary			1
@entity123 effectively responded by appearing with his wife , @entity126 , on @entity128 's " @entity127			2
" he went on to win the presidency and earn high approval ratings			0
the future of @entity1 remains unclear : will he suffer the fate of @entity99 or succeed as @entity123 did ? there are several reasons that , at least initially , @entity1 has been able to survive the frenzy			1
the first is a certain numbness that @entity19 have to ongoing stories about the poor behavior of politicians			1
we live in a cynical age when @entity19 do n't expect much from their leaders			1
scandals can certainly destroy political futures , as was the case with rep. @entity146 or two - time presidential candidate @entity147 , but there is an equal chance that the public wo n't find a particular case all that shocking			2
( in the cases of @entity146 and @entity147 , their initial denials were proven wrong ; in @entity1 's case , the truth of the accusations has n't been established			1
) the second reason is that partisanship has become so intense these days that there is naturally going to be suspicion that charges such as these might come from political opponents			0
@entity1 has played into this belief by accusing his political opponents , ranging from gov. @entity166 's campaign to liberals , of being behind the charges			1
@entity1 also might survive this scandal because this story has emerged so long before any voting starts			1
the @entity172 caucuses and @entity125 primary are months away , and the opinions of voters wo n't be definitively known till then			0
even if party leaders put pressure on @entity1 , they 'll have limited effect , given that @entity1 is not part of the party establishment			1
he does n't really care what the leaders of the @entity24 have to say			0
that 's in fact the point of his campaign			2
in that sense , he is very much like @entity190 in @entity24 clothes			0
none of this is to say that @entity1 is safe			2
the fact is that if stories about his alleged misbehavior continue to emerge , and the substance of more of these accusations becomes public , the real power brokers in modern campaigns -- the fundraisers and campaign donors -- will make a decision for him			1
they will turn off the spigot of money that he would need to make his campaign real			2
this is the ultimate check on his future			0
they sense a real opportunity to win this election and do n't have much stomach for picking someone who could implode in the general election come september 2012			0
given his inexperience in the political realm , @entity1 is already a high - risk candidate			1
a few more accusations and his candidacy could come to an early end			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			2

@entity1 's campaign has so far survived accusations of sexual harassment
@entity222 says many factors affect whether a candidate can survive a scandal
@entity1 is *helped* by partisan atmosphere in @entity19 politics , @entity222 says
@entity222 : ultimately the donors who fund campaign could bring it to an early end
