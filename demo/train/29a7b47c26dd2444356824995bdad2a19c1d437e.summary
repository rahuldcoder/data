-- @entity1 on saturday demanded the release of @entity3 as the @entity5 soldier marked his 24th birthday in @entity8 ' captivity			1
" the thoughts of many in @entity1 are with @entity3 and his family , " the @entity9 said			1
" his detention is unjustifiable and unacceptable			0
the @entity1 government demands his immediate and unconditional release			0
" @entity3 has been held captive since june 25 , 2006 , when @entity17 militants from @entity18 captured him			1
the militants had tunneled into @entity5 and attacked an @entity5 army outpost near the @entity18 - @entity5 - @entity21 border , killing two soldiers in the assault			0
@entity5 immediately launched a military incursion into @entity18 to rescue @entity3 , then 19 , but failed to free him			1
since being imprisoned by @entity8 , @entity3 has not been allowed any contact with the outside world , nor any visits by the @entity28			1
details of his incarceration and physical condition remain unknown			0
in october 2009 , @entity8 released a tape of @entity3 as a proof of life , in which he urged the @entity5 government to do more for his safe release			2
@entity3 's family has been working to free the soldier and ramped up their efforts during the current holy month of @entity42			1
@entity3 , the soldier 's father , recently appealed directly to @entity17 in @entity18 to put pressure on their @entity8 leadership for a prisoner swap during the @entity48 holy month of @entity42 , which ends september 9			1
the father has repeated his stance that the @entity5 government should release 1,000 prisoners , including 450 whose release @entity8 has demanded in exchange for his son			2
he has been holding a vigil outside the home of @entity5 prime minister @entity58 since early july , when he led a march to his doorstep to support a prisoner exchange as a way to release his son			0
this @entity42 is different than the previous four , @entity3 said , because there is now a deal that was put on the table at the beginning of the year by a @entity68 mediator			2
" if the two sides of the conflict show some flexibility , it will be possible to make an agreement , " @entity3 said			2
such an agreement , @entity3 said , would benefit thousands of @entity17 families who would have their fathers and sons back to celebrate the festival of @entity42			2
" i would welcome any release of @entity17 prisoners , but i would welcome the release of one @entity5 prisoner , " said the emotional @entity3 , raising a solitary finger			1
the issue of @entity3 came up after @entity1 prime minister @entity86 issued tough talk about the @entity17 territory of @entity18 during a visit to @entity90 , comments seen as criticism of @entity5			2
" let me also be clear that the situation in @entity18 has to change			0
humanitarian goods and people must flow in both directions			0
@entity18 can not and must not be allowed to remain a prison camp , " @entity86 said			0
he also referred to the territory as a " prison camp			0
" residents of @entity18 say they have suffered greatly under an @entity5 goods blockade implemented since @entity8 took control of the territory after elections in 2006			0
but @entity5 says its tough measures are necessary to stop weapons from reaching @entity8 militants intent on destroying @entity5			0
@entity106 , @entity5 's ambassador to @entity1 , reacted quickly to the prime minister 's remark , saying that @entity8 is responsible for the misery in @entity18 and raised the issue of @entity3 's captivity			1
" we know that the prime minister would also share our grave concerns about our own prisoner in the @entity18 , @entity3 , who has been held hostage there for over four years , without receiving a single @entity28 visit , " @entity106 said .			1

@entity3 has been held captive since june 2006
