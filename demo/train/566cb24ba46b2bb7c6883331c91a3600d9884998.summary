@entity1 , @entity0 -- there is one man who will be pacing around the @entity5 in @entity6 this week hoping to make it three majors in a row -- but you wo n't find his name when you trail your finger down the list of starters at the @entity15			0
@entity16 possesses a mental toughness that none of his competitors can match			1
though his presence may be unnoticed by spectators lining the fairways , his influence on the players he coaches is becoming far more conspicuous			0
that is because sports psychologist dr. @entity26 , or " @entity27 " as his players like to call him , is fast gaining a reputation for being one of the best mental coaches in golf			1
so far this year his mastery of the mind has helped @entity35 and @entity36 win the @entity37 and the @entity38 respectively			1
in 2007 , @entity26 helped @entity39 to his masters ' triumph at the @entity42			1
a win for one of @entity26 ' players at this year 's pga would complete a career slam of majors for the psychologist			1
it is a cast iron certainty that this week 's winner will not only have to master the course -- all 7674 yards of it -- but also his mental demons coming down the stretch on sunday evening			2
learning to cope with such pressure is not easy			0
" it does n't just happen , you have to develop the mental game off the golf course , " @entity26 told @entity2			1
the best players on the @entity60 are consistently honing their mental skills and @entity26 -- who studied under the game 's most renowned psychologist , @entity62 , at the @entity64 in the 1990s -- is now just one of dozens of mind men employed by pros on the @entity60			1
" good players are mentally good when their game is on			2
great players are mentally good regardless of where their game is			2
they are constantly remembering past memories -- where they 've won , where they putted good , and so on			0
" @entity26 says it is important for players to put aside a set amount of time before a competition visualizing how they see themselves walking , their tempo and thinking about the demeanor they want to convey			1
but it is more than just about ramming home a message about the powers of positive thinking			0
@entity26 advises more technical players to find ways of accepting where shots go , relaxing in between and staying patient			1
someone who struggles with shot selection will require a strategy that focuses on being decisive			0
" being great behind the ball so you can be great over the ball , " @entity26 says			1
it 's the sort of mantra you sense that @entity16 has probably uttered to himself thousands of times down the years			1
the mental side is part of the game that @entity16 has paid close attention to ever since he was a boy			1
when most teenagers were blithely thwacking balls out on the range and dreaming of future glory , @entity16 was already laying the foundations of his mental toughness			1
with the help of dr @entity109 -- a former military man and friend of @entity16 ' late father @entity111 -- @entity112 was being drilled in strategies of emotional detachment in pressure situations			1
as @entity26 points out , it 's been key to his success			1
" if you learn these mental skills when you are young , it becomes second nature to you			1
most guys start learning to be good mentally when they are 30 and it 's not easy to incorporate			0
for @entity16 , it 's always been part of his game			1
for others it 's an add on			0
" @entity26 , who has also worked in @entity129 and @entity130 , identifies @entity16 ' extraordinary mental control in adversity as one of his greatest assets			1
" his confidence around his scoring is not going to be affected by his confidence about his ball striking			0
he might have his a-game , but if he does n't , it 's like he says : ' i 'll figure out a way and hit three wood or an iron ' -- like he did at @entity145 [ in 2006 ]			0
other guys confidence is all around : ' if i do n't hit it good , then i ca n't score good ' and they take themselves out of it			0
" back to back wins on the @entity60 have ensured @entity16 is one of the hottest favorites -- even by his standards -- to win his fifth @entity15			1
and it seems implausible that he will miss two major cuts on the bounce			2
if he is in the mix come sunday , it is , according to @entity26 , another edge he has over his competitors			1
" he 's been through those experiences more than anyone he 's going to face and is familiar with how the intense pressure changes your body			0
when you 've been there so often , like @entity16 has , it 's easier to manage			2
i think he still gets nervous and gets those feelings of wanting to win			0
i just think he does n't get overwhelmed by them like some guys do			0
" but that 's all to come			0
for now , @entity26 is concentrating on getting his players in good shape for the tournament			2
and that means sticking to the same routine			0
" it 's not masters week or @entity181 week			0
it 's what course are we going to ? is it @entity42 , @entity186 or @entity5 ? " @entity26 said			2
during practice rounds , @entity26 will spend around half a day with each of his players			2
he 'll see them during their warm ups and , if required , work through some putting or short game drills after a round			2
he 's confident one of his charges can do the business this week			0
@entity36 , @entity35 and @entity39 were all in the top five heading into the final round at @entity199 last weekend			1
" they are all probably feeling that they are pretty close , " he said			0
but judging by @entity16 ' current form , they will do well to hold him off			2
@entity26 and his players do n't discuss @entity205 , but they do talk about strategies if they are paired with him			2
" you have to be prepared for the crowd that follow him			0
when you play with @entity16 you know that there is going to be a lot of chaos and confusion , " @entity26 said			1
he ca n't see past @entity205 this week			0
" i 'm sure he still struggles with some shots , some putts , like everybody does			0
but i ca n't see any weaknesses in his game			2
i 'm just hoping that he 's peaked a little early ! "			0

sports psychologist dr @entity26 has coached the last two major winners
@entity36 , @entity35 and @entity39 have all benefited from his skills
@entity26 : " for @entity16 , mental *strength* has always been part of his game "
