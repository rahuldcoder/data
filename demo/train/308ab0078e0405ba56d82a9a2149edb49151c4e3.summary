-- @entity1 , who died tuesday at the age of 89 , always said , not altogether happily , that she would be defined by her relationship with her husband , the great actor @entity4			1
she was not entirely wrong			0
it is hard to think of @entity1 without thinking of @entity4			1
when she first arrived on screen in 1944 in " to have and have not , " at the ripe old age of 19 , the thing that captivated audiences was not her beauty -- there were lots of pretty girls on screen -- so much as her preternatural steeliness			2
here was a woman who could stand up to @entity4 purring line by purring line , menacing look by menacing look , sneer by sneer , which may be why he wound up falling in love with her in real life			1
she was not a shrinking violet			0
but if @entity1 was unflappable , she was different from her steely predecessors , the so - called tough " broads " of the 1930s like @entity31 and @entity32			1
they were victims of the @entity39 , victims of male dominance , victims of bad breaks , victims of life in general			0
those things made them feral , which is not an adjective anyone would ever have used on the self - contained , self - possessed @entity1			1
they were at war with life , hoping to find some good man with whom they might be able to make a truce			0
@entity1 did n't seem to be at war with anyone , and she certainly did n't seem to think she needed a man to fulfill her			2
in fact , she was pretty much unpossessable			0
she did things on her terms			0
if you think of @entity31 and @entity32 as curs , @entity1 was a cat			2
she arose at a time when @entity59 was ending and film noir was beginning , and she was the perfect noir woman			1
@entity61 was a style of film , dark and edgy , but it was also an attitude of post-war ennui and cynicism			0
her memorable quotes in noir , you trusted people at your peril			0
@entity1 embodied that attitude perfectly in films like " @entity75 , " " @entity76 " and " @entity77 , " all of which co-starred @entity4			1
there was something slippery and unknowable about her , some sort of concealment , which fit the whole noir ambiance			0
and it was n't coincidental that the perfect noir woman was also the perfect complement and foil for the great existential hero of the movies , @entity4			1
she was the great existential romantic partner			0
that attitude of hers seemed to arise from a personal grievance that @entity1 developed growing up in @entity91 as @entity1 , a jew who was remade into a cinematic gentile by the anti-semitic director @entity94			1
as @entity1 tells it in her first memoir , " by @entity101 , " @entity95 was a pygmalion who discovered her and then taught her how to move , how to talk ( that deep , sultry husk of a voice ) and how to act			2
but the umbrage she felt toward @entity95 in making her deny herself may have been the razor 's edge she brought to her performances			1
she was always forced to be in camouflage -- a hidden jew			0
she even raised her children as @entity109 , @entity4 's religion , because she feared what might happen to them as @entity111			1
for noir , the edge certainly worked			2
@entity114 recalls screen legend @entity1 but the persona outlasted its time			1
well before @entity4 died of cancer in 1957 , @entity1 's career had begun to slide , in part because noir had begun to slide , relegated to b movies			1
she was able to reinvent herself in romantic comedies like " @entity129 , " where she turned her sultriness into a kind of brisk efficiency , a no - nonsense woman for the 1950s , that contrasted with co-star @entity126 's flouncy availability , but the glory days were pretty much over			1
in retrospect , she had n't been so much a star as she was a flare			0
her late great triumphs were on stage -- in " @entity138 , " a musical adaptation of " @entity140 , " and " @entity147 , " a musical adaptation of the 1942 film of the same name , both of which earned her @entity146			0
still , the fact that she was reprising roles originally played by @entity31 and @entity150 respectively was a sign that @entity1 's own feline charm had not endured			2
in the end , she was a glamorous figure from another , darker era			0
and the wife of @entity4 .			2

@entity1 , a @entity114 icon , died on tuesday at the age of 89
@entity161 : she would be defined by her *marriage* to the great actor @entity4
he says self - possessed @entity1 was the perfect noir woman , she had the right attitude
@entity161 : despite the razor 's edge she brought to screen , her persona outlasted its time
