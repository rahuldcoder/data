@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity4 @entity3 reached agreement late monday on a budget resolution for 2010 , which includes key spending priorities for the young @entity9 administration			1
the @entity4 and @entity2 could vote on the budget resolution tuesday			1
president @entity9 's budget request is $ 3.67 trillion			1
" this budget is a major accomplishment , " @entity13 chairman @entity12 said in a statement			0
" we are meeting president @entity9 's goals of reducing our dependence on foreign energy , striving for excellence in education , reforming our health care system , and providing middle - class tax relief			1
" the agreement came as lawmakers were reconciling the @entity2 and @entity4 versions of the budget package			1
the president 's budget request is $ 3.67 trillion			2
the full @entity4 and @entity2 are each expected to vote on the fiscal 2010 budget resolution this week			1
the @entity2 vote could come as soon as tuesday			2
budget negotiators have fast - tracked part of the budget process			2
major health reform is likely to pass this year , because the special process -- known as budget reconciliation -- wo n't allow republicans to filibuster the legislation , as was widely expected			0
democrats , who currently control 58 seats in the @entity4 , will be able to pass it with a simple majority vote , instead of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster			2
separately , conservative democrats in the @entity2 , who have been pushing for a strong statement from leadership on fiscal responsibility in the budget , may have some of their concerns addressed			1
a @entity3 aide told @entity1 that house speaker @entity55 and @entity2 majority whip @entity56 are drafting a letter to @entity4 leaders " throwing down the gauntlet " to insist that a pay - as - you - go system be followed , which would require new federal spending to be offset with budget cuts or tax increases			1
president @entity9 called for the so - called " @entity67 " legislation in his weekend radio address			1
the budget resolution would limit increases in non-defense discretionary spending to 2.9 percent through 2014 , according to @entity12			2
" while the budget resolution takes important steps in the near - term of cutting the deficit in half by 2012 and by two - thirds by 2014 , it is clear that more will be needed to address the long - term fiscal imbalance confronting the nation beyond the five - year budget window , " said @entity12			1
president @entity9 gathered his @entity82 members last week and challenged them to cut a total of $ 100 million in the next 90 days			1
in the context of the federal budget , $ 100 million in savings is a tiny amount , critics said			0
it is the equivalent , according to one example , of having a car dealer offer to shave $ 1 from the cost of a $ 36,700 vehicle			0
" any amount of savings is obviously welcome , " senate minority leader @entity94 , @entity95 , said at the time			0
" but ( $ 100 million is ) about the average amount we 'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year			0
" @entity2 press secretary @entity102 said ordinary @entity103 would nevertheless appreciate the savings effort			0
" only in @entity0 , is $ 100 million dollars not a lot of money			0
it is where i 'm from			0
it is where i grew up			0
and i think it is for hundreds of millions of @entity103			0
" @entity1 's @entity113 contributed to this report .			0
