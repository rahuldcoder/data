-- taking time out to eat a homemade chocolate cake is hardly the conventional way to win an ultra-endurance marathon , but do n't tell @entity4			1
her quirky and offbeat approach -- she competes sporting a hair band adorned with flowers -- has proved a breath of fresh air in the male - dominated sport of @entity11 , where she has become world and @entity15 champion			1
fleet of foot , she makes light work of massive mountains such as @entity19 and the @entity20 -- running with a permanent smile etched across her face -- because for @entity4 this truly is a labor of love			1
" it 's my biggest passion , you create a relationship with nature , " the @entity26 tells @entity0 's human to @entity28			1
" i love to be in the mountains because it gives me a feeling of freedom and what is real			2
" worryingly for her rivals , @entity4 admits that the other reason for her cheery disposition is that she also has plenty of room for improvement			2
" i 'm smiling because i 'm so happy to get to do what i love the most , " she says			0
" and also because i 'm very bad in pushing myself over the limit			0
i 'm always pretty comfortable , i do n't want to suffer ! i can remember only one or two races when i was really hurting			0
" and the flowers in her hair ? " in @entity26 we only have them for two months , so it 's always nice to have beauty around you , " the 27 - year - old explains			1
" it 's just a nice thing to have in the hair , it 's a nice touch			2
" @entity4 is also aware that the majority of the competitors in @entity11 mountain races are men and she likes to strike a feminine chord			1
but her appearance and friendly disposition belie a fiercely competitive instinct , and she has not only been dominating the women 's competitions but also regularly placing in the top 10 against all opposition			0
@entity4 's other major passion is baking , stemming from her time as a chalet girl at a ski resort			1
her personal website is a mixture of running anecdotes and " recipes from a mountain lover " for her favorite treats such as cinnamon cakes and apple pie			0
she tries out her efforts on her boyfriend @entity81 , who just happens to be the the dominant male competitor on the world @entity11 circuit with a string of big race victories and records			1
" i love sweet things and my boyfriend loves sweet things , so it 's a win / win situation , " she says			0
" i can bake as much as i want and i know what 's inside and how good it is and only with good ingredients			0
" back in 2010 , on her way to her first victory in a mountain marathon , @entity4 naturally thought it would be a good idea to take a treat with her on the way			2
she spent 20 minutes at the summit to chomp through that chocolate cake before continuing to the finish			0
her undoubted talent drew her to the attention of professional @entity11 outfit @entity107 , although @entity4 admits she had little knowledge of the discipline and the existence of a circuit			1
" i got an invitation to @entity114 ( in 2012 ) to join them for a training camp and i was like , ' yeah ! i 'll try that , ' " she recalls			0
" i got to realize that @entity11 is a very big sport here in @entity15 and it 's actually bigger than cross-country skiing is in @entity26 and for me , cross-country skiing is really big			1
" an almost overnight success , @entity4 now lives with @entity81 in the @entity124 ski resort of @entity125 , under the shadow of the imposing @entity19 , the perfect training ground for the sport 's golden couple			1
and for @entity4 , her idea of a perfect day is most people 's idea of purgatory : an eight - hour run on mountain trails at high altitude			1
she spends up to an average of six hours per day , week on week preparing for her heavy racing program			0
" i wore out seven pairs of shoes last summer , " she reveals			0
@entity11 has three main disciplines : a vertical race , which is entirely uphill ; a standard event held over between 20 - 40 km , involving an ascent and descent ; and the blue riband " ultra " held mostly over 80 km. @entity4 excels at all the distances and is now tackling longer races -- her biggest challenge being a 30 - hour - plus 170 km test , during which even she admitted she had doubts about finishing as the going got particularly tough			1
her love of natural surroundings became engrained from an upbringing on a rugged coastal region in eastern @entity26 , with her family home surrounded by " hilly terrain and wild forests			2
" there was not much time spent watching television or sitting by a computer and , with her grandparents on her mother 's side from @entity167 , she spent a lot of time in the mountains as well			2
" i have always been fascinated about mountains , the views and just the freedom you get there , and when i was finished high school i moved to the mountains and i just started to train there , " @entity4 says			1
" i went up to summits , i went climbing and so i started @entity11 -- but i did n't know that i was doing it			2
i just did what i loved			0
" as a student , @entity4 gained a degree in biology , but her @entity183 deposition is on hold while she concentrates on training and racing professionally -- particularly given her recent successes			2
they have bought her widespread acclaim , but an incident in september 2013 served notice of the dangers of extreme sport and sparked some adverse publicity			0
she and @entity81 were attempting to climb the @entity195 , a near 4,000m mountain in the @entity19 region , when they ran into trouble near the summit in rapidly deteriorating weather conditions			1
dressed only in light jackets and wearing just running shoes , they were left trapped on a rock face in driving winds , snow and fog			0
rather than taking more risks by rappelling ( abseiling ) back down the mountain while freezing cold , the pair decided to call out the local mountain rescue team and sit tight			0
with conditions too bad for a helicopter to operate , they had to wait seven long hours before receiving assistance			0
it was a salutary lesson of the power of nature			0
" we underestimated the conditions , " @entity4 wrote on her personal website			2
" the stupid mistake was i did not take a lot of extra warm clothes			0
" " we are people			0
we make mistakes and learn from them			0
but this is still the way i love to be in the mountains			0
" after the @entity11 season finishes , the adventurous duo spend their winters competing in ski mountaineering races , which combine alpine and cross-country skiing -- @entity4 competed in the latter @entity236 discipline growing up in @entity26 -- and climbing selected peaks			1
" i first tried it two years ago and i got really hooked and i 've reached a pretty good level , " she says			0
" i can live from that during the winter and it 's a really nice complement for @entity11 as well			1
" for @entity4 's rivals there is yet more cold comfort in her future ambitions on the circuit			1
" each race i want to improve , each race i want to do again , but for sure i want to improve and i have so much more i can improve on , so this is my motivation			0
" with such distances to be covered , and over uneven terrain , to the uninitiated there appears to be the prospect of physical burnout , but @entity4 tells another story			2
" i have never been injured despite racing almost every weekend			0
@entity11 has less impact on your body than road running where the movement and impact is so repetitive			2
" the sport 's governing body will be keeping its fingers crossed that @entity4 stays clear of mishaps and lays a trail for other young women to make their mark			1
@entity270 , the vice-president of the @entity271 , summed up her appeal			0
" i 've rarely seen such unbounded love of the mountains in anyone , " @entity270 told the @entity275 's @entity274 newspaper last year			1
it 's a love that shows no sign of abating , and @entity4 is already setting herself new goals , longer races , scaling ever higher peaks as fast as possible			1
she is inspired by @entity81 , a 26 - year - old from the @entity286 region of @entity287 who has set a series of mind - boggling records			1
last year , @entity81 ran up and down the @entity20 in just two hours 52 minutes , smashing the previous best time			1
@entity4 now also holds the women 's records for routes on the @entity20 and @entity19 and is particularly proud of her efforts			1
" it 's not all about the records but i really like to move fast in the mountains and then when you reach the record , it 's ' wow ! ' it 's pretty amazing to be the woman who is fastest up and down on the mountains , for sure , " she says			1
" racing wise , my first year @entity11 i won the world championship , and last year i was the @entity15 champion in both long and short distance and second in the vertical , so it 's a lot of titles but it 's not only about the titles , it 's about what you do to get there			1
" that " journey " to the top of such a challenging and at times dangerous sport involves long and lonely hours of preparation , but it appears @entity4 's very raison d'etre has been satisfied			2
" it 's my life , it 's my passion , i love mountains			2
" it 's as simple as that .			0
