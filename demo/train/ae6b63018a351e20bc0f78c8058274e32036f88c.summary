@entity0 -- with the approach of congressional elections and the midpoint of what he hopes will be his first of two four - year terms , president @entity2 is honing a humor - laced stump speech that is part pep talk , part populist ideology			1
@entity2 delivered similar versions of the speech at six fundraising events this week , kicking into full campaign mode with calls to continue the progress made so far by his administration			1
his poll numbers are shrinking , and democrats are resigned to losing some congressional seats in november			1
amid unabated criticism from the political right and unyielding legislative opposition by @entity25 , the @entity21 wants to galvanize the liberal base and maintain support from independents vital to @entity2 's election but who polls show turning away			1
the basic premise of the president 's stump speech message is that his administration inherited a mess after eight years of @entity25 leadership and needs more time to fully fix it while also positioning @entity37 to prosper in coming generations			1
@entity25 complain @entity2 's repeated references to problems he inherited are intended to duck responsibility for what they call failures of his own policies that have allowed unemployment to remain high amid a sluggish recovery			1
@entity2 , however , insists that full economic recovery from such a deep recession will take years , and that his administration has so far laid the basis for continued improvement while addressing longstanding problems he cites what he calls his main achievements -- reversing the recession , getting health care reform and @entity59 reform bills passed -- and touts energy reform proposals intended to greatly increase clean energy alternatives to make the @entity37 industry globally competitive in the 21st century			1
overall , though , the lingering message is that the @entity25 screwed up when in power , and now @entity19 are making things right			2
partisan rhetoric and jokes abound			0
in almost every speech , @entity2 says republicans are counting on voter amnesia about @entity25 policies that led to the @entity59 meltdown and economic recession			1
he acknowledges some of his polices have been unpopular , particularly bailing out big banks and automakers			0
" i actually have pollsters , so i know when things are n't popular , " he said tuesday at an event for @entity0 sen. @entity78 , repeating an oft - used line that always prompts laughter and applause			2
" i know when they do n't poll well			0
but i was not sent to @entity0 just to do what was popular			0
i was sent to do what was right			0
" noting his campaign rally cry of " yes we can , " he lampoons what he calls the obstructionism of congressional @entity25 by dropping his voice into a kind of growl to mimic what he offers as their slogan : " no we ca n't			2
" " that 's really inspiring , " he deadpanned to laughter and applause at the @entity100 event			2
" this vision they have for the future , " @entity2 continued , pausing to add , " gives you a little pep in your step when you hear it , do n't you ? " before adding a final " no , we ca n't			1
" when he 's really revved up , @entity2 shifts to the car - in - a - ditch analogy			1
specific words change a little each time , but the message is unwavering : republicans drove the @entity37 economy off the road through failed policies of tax cuts , deregulation and increased spending , and now his administration is getting it out of the ditch			2
with @entity2 , it 's all in the delivery			1
" they spent almost a decade driving the economy into a ditch , " he said tuesday , pausing several times as laughter erupted			0
" and so me and @entity78 , and a bunch of others , we go down there and we put on our boots and we 're pushing and shoving			0
and it 's muddy and there are bugs and we 're sweating and shoving , pushing hard			2
" the @entity25 , meanwhile , are standing by " sipping @entity135 " and calling out " you 're not pushing hard enough " and " that 's not the right way to push , " @entity2 continued , pretending to sip a slurpee to laughter and applause			1
" so finally , finally , @entity78 and @entity142 and everybody , we finally get the car up on level ground			0
we 're about to go forward , " @entity2 said			1
" and these guys come and tap us on the shoulder , and they say , ' we want the keys back			0
' " he shouted over the roaring laughter to deliver his punch line : " you ca n't have the keys back ! you do n't know how to drive ! " in recent weeks , @entity2 included an additional jab based on motor vehicle transmission symbols			1
" you notice , when you want to move forward in your car , what do you do ? " he said tuesday			0
" you put your car in @entity159			0
' when you want to go backwards , you put it in ' @entity25 ' " with the crowd applauding , he declared : " back into the ditch			0
keep that in mind in november			2
that 's not a coincidence			2
" along with the humor comes more stern rhetoric that depicts @entity25 as the enemy of ordinary citizens			2
on tuesday , he described the basic @entity25 philosophy as cutting taxes for " millionaires and billionaires " who do n't need it , cutting rules for special interests , gutting regulations that protect clean air and clean water " and things that most of us value , " and then cutting " working folks loose to fend for themselves			0
" " so if you ca n't find a job or you ca n't afford college or do n't have health insurance , tough luck -- you are on your own , " @entity2 continued			1
" now , if you 're a @entity59 bank or an insurance company or an oil company like @entity194 , come on in , help us write the regulations			0
" the @entity37 people tried those policies for eight years under the previous @entity25 administration , @entity2 said , adding : " and it did n't work			1
" " it gave us record deficits and ultimately led to the worst economic crisis since the @entity204 , " he said			0
" now , i bring all this stuff up not because i want to re-litigate the past , " @entity2 said as applause erupted			1
" i just do n't want to relive the past			0
" republicans , he said , are " counting on the fact that you do n't remember ; that you 're going to forget what happened when they were in charge for eight years			0
" " so that 's the choice in this election , " @entity2 said			1
" do we go back to the policies that got us into this mess , or do we keep moving forward ? i believe we move forward			0
