" listen , do n't rush on boats to leave the country , " @entity13 says in @entity20			0
" if you do that , we 'll all have even worse problems			0
because , i 'll be honest with you : if you think you will reach the @entity4 and all the doors will be wide open to you , that 's not at all the case			1
and they will intercept you right on the water and send you back home where you came from			0
" the @entity37 , a large transport aircraft , is flying and broadcasting five hours a day over @entity7 , authorities said			1
in addition to the message from @entity13 , it is broadcasting news from @entity43 and instructions on hygiene procedures to prevent disease			1
" we are sending public service messages ... to save lives , " said @entity48 deputy spokesman @entity47			0
" it is part of the @entity4 effort to help keep @entity7 safe			1
we do n't want people to endanger their lives by taking risk to try to get to the @entity4 at this time			2
" @entity7 who have valid visas can come to the @entity4 on commercial flights			1
meanwhile , the @entity61 has activated a task force to review plans on how to respond to a mass migration from @entity7 if necessary			1
but officials stressed that the measures are being taken out of an abundance of caution			0
" we 're actively looking for signs that the citizens of @entity7 [ are migrating by sea ] but right now there 's no sign , " said @entity71 lt. cmdr			2
" the only movement of people we 've seen has been all inland			0
" @entity76 said a sea migration is unlikely " if for no other reason than there 's this massive federal government presence [ in @entity7 ] trying to deliver humanitarian relief			1
" " we 've probably never had this great of a situational awareness of what 's going on in @entity7 as we do right now , " he added			2
full coverage @entity89 updates the @entity71 has five cutters off the @entity7 coast focused on delivering humanitarian assistance , and is moving more into the area			2

" attempts to enter the @entity4 by sea are inherently dangerous , " he said			2
migrants typically use crowded , poorly built boats and " put themselves at the mercy of smugglers			0
" it 's simply a prudent measure [ to activate the task force ] , " he said			0
" given the situation and not wanting to be caught unprepared , it makes sense to at least look at the plan and make sure that the people in the appropriate agencies are ready and able to execute the plan if it 's warranted			0
