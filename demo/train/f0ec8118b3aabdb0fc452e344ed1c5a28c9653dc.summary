-- for @entity2 student @entity1 , what started off as a bet fueled by youthful ambition and technical bravado , ended up an internet hit and quite possibly a job			1
last week , @entity1 , 19 , was just an ordinary , albeit talented , college student as he tested out @entity10 , the web giant 's new predictive search results feature			1
he was immediately impressed on its debut wednesday but also inspired			0
to his roommate , he said , " i bet you i can build @entity1 in an hour			1
" and his roommate took him up on the bet			0
@entity1 did n't quite make the hour deadline , but three hours later , @entity1 was born			1
the site lets people search the enormous @entity1 video database in real time			1
he spent a couple more hours thursday sprucing up the user interface			2
and before going to sleep that night , he posted his work to his @entity28 page			0
" when i woke up friday morning there was craziness , " he said			0
by " craziness , " @entity1 means countless e-mails congratulating him , a bevy of interview requests , a server flooded with web traffic , the creation of a @entity39 entry in his name , and -- perhaps most notably -- a job offer from @entity1 ceo @entity43 via @entity44			1
unsure just how seriously to take the tweeted job offer , @entity1 replied along the lines of " is this a for - real offer ? " @entity43 then e-mailed him to set up a meeting , which is scheduled for monday at @entity1 's @entity49 , @entity50 , headquarters , @entity1 said			1
@entity1 officials did n't respond to an e-mail request sent friday from @entity0 seeking confirmation of the job offer or meeting			2
@entity1 is just finishing up a summer internship with @entity28 , but he does n't see how that would prohibit his taking a job at @entity1 , which is owned by @entity10			2
" i 'd like to finish college , " he added , which he agreed could pose the bigger problem			0
much like @entity10 , @entity1 lets people type in what they 're looking for , and the engine guesses what that video is			1
by design , it plays the video immediately			2
however , based on feedback , @entity1 said he 's working on play and pause features , among other improvements			1
" it 's not as useful as @entity10 if you know exactly what you 're looking for , since you 're shown distracting @entity1 videos on the way to your destination , " @entity1 told @entity74 's @entity73			1
" but i think this is perfect for many internet users			0
" he built the site using the @entity84 but scraped @entity1 search suggestions after @entity10 blocked his server for making too many repeated requests to the search suggestion endpoint			1
@entity1 ended up re-writing the site to instead query @entity1 directly for search suggestions , " eliminating the round - trip to my server , " he said			1
@entity1 , who is from @entity92 , @entity50 , said he 's been blown away by how quickly his tool went viral and is grateful for all the supportive feedback			1
" i 'm amazed and humbled by all the attention it 's received			0
so thank you , " he said			0
but imitation is the highest form of flattery , and it appears he 's got that , too			0
@entity102 on saturday pointed to @entity104 - based developer @entity103 , who , inspired by @entity1 , used @entity105 and the @entity106 @entity84 to build @entity107			2
and the same blogger later pointed to an all - encompassing @entity110 page that gives a home to the evidently quickly growing number of sites with instant , predictive search results			2
@entity110 was reportedly designed by @entity117 engineer @entity116 , @entity102 said			0
@entity1 is a majoring in computer science , but his technical expertise has been developing over many years			2
around age 5 , when his parents bought a new microwave oven , he took the manual and learned how to turn on the child lock , something his parents never learned to do			0
that knowledge came in handy when he was old enough to get grounded -- he would lock it up and use it as a bargaining chip			0
