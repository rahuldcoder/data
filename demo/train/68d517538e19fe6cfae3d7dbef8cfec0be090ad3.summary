-- last night 's shooting rampage at a movie theater in @entity3 , @entity4 , was a nightmare			1
authorities have already arrested a suspect			0
four weapons were recovered in the shooting scene , including a shotgun and two handguns			0
twelve people have been killed , with many more injured			0
according to law enforcement officials , the weapons were purchased legally by the suspect in the last six months			0
and it makes us think once again about how we can address the horrific problem of gun violence in @entity21			1
the first task is conceptual -- can we figure out what will work ? the second task is political -- can plausible solutions be implemented legislatively ? opinion : gun control wo n't stop mass murder the conceptual problem is immensely difficult , especially in a society that is already as gun - saturated as @entity21 is today			1
the political problem borders on the impossible			0
gun policy in this country is made by the @entity34 , and no serious effort at gun control can currently get past its veto			1
even when legislation passed during the @entity39 years in the form of the @entity42 bill , requiring background checks at the time of gun purchases , or the assault weapons ban , the @entity34 succeeded in injecting gaping loopholes into the laws			1
who needs to go through a background check at @entity51 when you can get your gun without one at the local gun show or from some shady figure on a street corner ? the assault weapon ban only prohibited the manufacture of new guns ( it grandfathered in a huge cache of pre-existing weapons ) and gun manufacturers easily redesigned their guns to circumvent the ban			0
the @entity34 then trumpets how " gun control " does n't work			1
commenters debate guns , ' what if ' consider what happened in @entity71 after a crazed gunman killed 35 people in @entity74 , @entity75 , in 1996			1
the @entity71 federal government persuaded all states and territories to implement tough new gun control laws			1
under the @entity81 ( @entity82 ) , firearms legislation was tightened throughout the country			0
national registration of guns was imposed and it became illegal to hold certain long guns that might be used in mass shootings			0
the gun ban was backed up by a mandatory buy - back program that substantially reduced gun possession in @entity71			2
@entity91 : ' @entity93 a weapon for war ' the effect was that both gun suicides and homicides ( as well as total suicides and homicides ) fell			0
importantly , while there were 13 mass shootings in @entity71 during the period of 1979 -- 96 , there have been none in the sixteen years since			2
in 1996 , then - prime minister @entity105 stated that the " whole scheme is designed to reduce the number of guns in the community and make @entity71 a safer place to live			2
" the @entity71 attorney general praised the cooperation and responsibility of @entity71 firearms owners with the gun controls and buy - back , saying , " they have been paid cash for their firearms - giving our nation a welcome @entity124 gift by removing unnecessary high - powered firearms from the community			2
it offers all of us the real chance of a safer festive season and @entity131			0
" opinion : can we feel safe in a crowd anymore ? of course , the @entity71 gun control law in 1997 enjoyed an extremely high level of public support and was not hampered by any domestic gun industry ( since @entity71 did not have any )			1
such would not be the case in the @entity21 where pro-gun political views and @entity34 power create a very different climate			2
in the wake of another tragic massacre of innocent lives , we should look carefully at the @entity71 experience to see if the @entity21 public will ever rise up as one against gun violence			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			0

a gunman went on a shooting rampage in a movie theater in @entity4
@entity151 : our gun policy is made by the @entity34
look to @entity71 in formulating an effective gun control policy , he says
@entity151 : the *question* is , will our country ever unify against gun violence
