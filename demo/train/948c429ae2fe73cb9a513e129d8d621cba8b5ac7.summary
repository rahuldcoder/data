-- artists @entity1 and @entity3 share a romantic magnetism that binds together their personal and professional lives			1
they finish each other 's sentences ; they encourage each other 's fantastical whims			2
it 's the kind of chemistry that creative types covet			1
the @entity16 - born @entity15 met in high school in @entity18 , @entity19 , and married in 1975			1
since then , they have achieved success in their respective worlds : @entity1 , as a fashion designer who counts @entity23 among her clients ; and @entity3 , as a cartoonist whose drawings have appeared in @entity27			1
they live and work together in a loft that takes up several floors in @entity31 , @entity18 , and offers a view of the @entity33			0
neither considers their ascent to fame conventional and , in many ways , they still regard themselves as outsiders in the fashion world			0
so , when @entity1 was approached about writing a book of fashion advice for women , she seized it as an opportunity to tell the world that there is no straightforward path to success , especially as a designer			1
naturally , @entity3 provided the drawings for " @entity52 , " which was published this year			1
and , of course , he was wearing a black jacket and pants designed by his wife when they visited @entity58 in may for a student auction at the @entity60			2
they spoke with @entity0 about love , life and labor			0
below is an edited transcript of the conversation			0
instant chemistry it was " love at first sight " ( for @entity3 at least ) in high school			1
@entity1 , however , took a few years to come around			1
they have since been together for more than 30 years in a union , equal parts romance and business , that 's the marvel of the fashion world			1
@entity3 : @entity1 walked into my @entity79 class , and it was love at first sight within three seconds			1
four years later , @entity1 finally realized how she felt about @entity3			1
@entity1 : i missed him			1
and i kind of pursued him			0
@entity3 : by then i was in a band -- i was already in @entity87 , i was doing my thing			1
i really grew up , so i think that was attractive to @entity1			1
so then we started dating , and then i wanted to marry her			0
she said no. @entity1 : i was playing hard to get			1
just like after high school , @entity1 decided to make the definitive move in her own time			1
@entity3 : she said , you know , i 'm ready to get married			1
and then that freaked me out totally			0
i was like a deer in the headlights ; i was like , ' @entity101 really ! ' you know , for us men , it 's an important moment			2
i had to think , ' now i 'm responsible for this woman for the rest of my life			0
' @entity1 : i went away			1
@entity3 : you went away again ! @entity1 had accepted an internship restoring costumes at the @entity112 , where she stayed for about four years			1
despite the odds , @entity3 and @entity1 somehow found their way to the altar -- over and over again			1
@entity1 : we got married three times			1
@entity3 : i called @entity118 to ask ' i want to get married , ' and they said ' this is what you do , you come to @entity122 at @entity123 , ' so i thought i was getting married but in fact it was just to get the license			1
so all our parents went and threw rice at us			0
@entity1 : so we turned around and said , ' we 're married ! ' ( the officials ) were like , ' what ? ' @entity3 : and they threw the rice , and we ran off to @entity133 , but we could n't tell ( our parents ) we were living in sin , so we had this lovely honeymoon			1
then we came back and had a secret wedding at @entity118 with my brother and your sister as our witnesses			0
and then we had the official church wedding			0
it was very low - key because @entity1 's dad had just passed away			1
white wedding , it was raining			0
@entity1 : it was sealed			1
art as self - discovery @entity1 's passion for " engineering clothes " began with sewing classes as a child in @entity16			1
for @entity3 , drawing is the way he thinks and expresses himself			1
whatever the means , both consider themselves artists first and foremost			0
@entity1 : i 've been sewing since i was 8 , and i started sewing because i did n't find anything that i loved			1
we had this condo in @entity16 , and ( my mother ) wanted us to go to a baby sitter			0
my older sisters were like , ' no way ! ' and she said , ' no , no , no , it 's not a baby sitter , it 's sewing classes			2
' so we thought we were going to school			2
and i 'm the only one that picked up on it			0
my elder sisters were not interested			0
so it was by accident			0
@entity3 , on the other hand , knew exactly what he wanted to do with his life from the start			2
@entity3 : i could draw before i could write or talk			2
drawing is how i think			0
to understand something , i have to draw it			0
i 'm like the original caveman			0
@entity3 and @entity1 agree that being an artist means to have complete freedom			1
@entity3 : i 'm lucky enough to only take on the projects that interest me , whether it 's doing somebody 's portrait or doing a mosaic or doing animation or doing ceramic or doing book covers for whatever it is			1
that 's a good place to be			2
you do n't have to lie			0
you really do what you believe in , you really do what you care about			0
it 's a wonderful gift			2
success in synthesis @entity202 the fashion designer became a household name in 2009 , when @entity23 wore a lemongrass shift and matching overcoat to her husband 's inauguration as 44th president of the @entity209			1
@entity3 : ( the dress ) was a gift from the universe			2
that was like one of those marvelous things			0
to be woven into history , it 's beyond you ! @entity1 had a creative block ; when time was running out , she noticed a small swatch of lemongrass fabric in her studio , and everything clicked			1
@entity1 : the emotion behind the dress was that piece of fabric			2
and immediately , i think it was overnight , i kept saying , what is it gon na be ? what is it gon na be ? and we laugh about it because i had a tantrum : ' but it 's too late now , it 's too late ! ' and he says , ' just send it , just send it ! ' @entity3 : @entity1 does n't sketch anything			1
my job was to sketch it with the swatch and send in an e-mail and suggest it			0
so i finally buckled her down and said , ' tell me what you want to do			0
' so she described what she wanted , and i sketched it down , we sent the quick sketch with the e-mail			0
@entity1 : that same saturday ! @entity3 : and five minutes later , we got an e-mail saying , ' make it happen , make it warm			1
' @entity1 : i still sweat thinking about that day			2
@entity1 was n't always into fashion , though , and to an extent she still is n't			2
@entity1 : i 'm not supposed to say i 'm not a fashion person , but i 'm not			2
i just , i love design			0
design is so different than fashion			0
that 's why design lasts forever			2
it 's like an engineer			0
i love to engineer a garment			0
to make this thing work , to make it stand , to make this sculpture work			0
i get all enthralled if i have to come up with : how do i sew this cloth ? what am i saying with the fabric ? it 's nothing to do with , ' what does it look like ? ' the next generation when @entity1 was asked to write a book of fashion tips , she refused			1
" i do n't give tips , " she said			0
" i make what i make , and women take to it			0
" the couple does have a few choice words for today 's young artists : save everything you make , because you 'll never be in the frame of mind to create the same thing twice			0
@entity3 : mistakes and false starts , that all leads to where you are			2
and it makes you ' you			0
' @entity1 : that 's your identity at the end			1
it 's ok not to have a plan			0
@entity3 : we did n't have a plan either , just be sincere in what you love			2
you do n't have to lead , or even follow			0
@entity1 : just do what you do			2
privately , in your own world			0
@entity3 : we do n't have a business partner			2
we 've never had regular backing			0
expose yourself to art so you know how to make it -- and if you do n't know how , make things by trial and error			0
@entity3 : you may have great ideas and great concepts , but if you ca n't make it materialize , you 're back at square one , you know ? you 're also at the mercy of people telling you it ca n't be done			2
@entity3 : we know that some things @entity1 makes are years ahead of its time , but it 's our job to let it happen , and perfect it in fact , so that when the world catches up to that idea , we 're the best at it			1
that 's why i think we 're still around after 30 years			1
