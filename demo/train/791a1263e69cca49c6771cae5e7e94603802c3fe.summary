as the situation in @entity2 escalates , the @entity0 finds itself awkwardly aligned with a country once vilified as part of the " @entity5			1
" while @entity2 loses control of its western border to @entity9 rebels , the @entity0 decides to pragmatically turn to its geopolitical interests to calm this disaster			2
the unlikely result is @entity13 sending military weaponry and planes -- including @entity17 combat jets -- across the @entity19 border to aid the @entity2 national army			2
this shift in alliance seemed implausible a few years ago , but since president @entity23 took office last year tensions between the @entity0 and @entity13 have slowly and cautiously thawed			2
while @entity2 plummets into further chaos and fragmentation -- the @entity26 are expected to vote for full autonomy in an impending referendum -- improvement in @entity13 relations may be the only silver - lining in this otherwise catastrophic affair			1
yet supporters of @entity0 - @entity13 relations should not forget the importance of promoting relations through long - term economic ties , rather than one based on purely geopolitical military needs			1
in the past decade , war has raged on two of @entity13 's borders , and seemingly both @entity13 and the @entity0 shared common enemies in the @entity45 and @entity46			1
however , foreign policy alignments in the region did not result in sustained diplomatic ties			0
by easing sanctions and fostering economic growth in @entity13 , the @entity0 can ultimately promote a sustainable relationship based on mutual needs and benefits			1
now more than ever , the opportunity for just such a partnership exists in @entity13 's budding technology market			1
currently , @entity13 has the highest total number of @entity60 users in the @entity61 ; almost half of @entity19 households have some access to the internet			2
there are more internet users in @entity13 than in @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , combined			0
interest among young @entity19 in technology and entrepreneurship is rapidly increasing			0
@entity13 's @entity77 recently announced that nearly 70 % of applicants for electronic retail licenses are younger than 30			1
rather than focusing on industries such as oil and gas , which ultimately trickles down profits to a few large companies closely aligned with the regime , promoting commercial development in the arena of tech entrepreneurship creates a high - skilled middle class			0
a thriving @entity19 middle class will have an invested interest in maintaining close relations with the @entity0 the long - term benefits of commercial development in @entity13 's tech sector are endless			1
transparency and increased openness in civil society through advances in social media , internet infrastructure and access to information are just some of the added benefits of a robust tech industry			0
promoting tech over other industries in @entity13 also allows the @entity0 to play an active role in a market that empowers women in business			1
unlike many @entity114 countries where women only account for 10 % of the tech industry , women in the @entity61 account for 35 % of tech entrepreneurs			0
this number is astonishing considering @entity114 notions of the marginalization of women in the region			0
women in the @entity61 are increasingly finding it both convenient and conducive to start small businesses from the comfort of their homes , and , thanks to increased internet access , they are now able to tap into global markets			0
the benefits of promoting the burgeoning tech industry in @entity13 have not gone unnoticed			0
@entity134 entrepreneurs plan to gather this september to discuss entrepreneurship in @entity13 , and , in the event that sanctions are lifted , the possibility of building bridges between entrepreneurs in @entity134 and their @entity19 counterparts			2
@entity13 's very own @entity142 , scheduled to take place in @entity144 later this year , is a result of enthusiasm surrounding technology and entrepreneurship			1
much of the eagerness surrounding @entity13 's tech scene is based on the possibility of the @entity0 changing its sanctions policy regarding @entity13			1
unlike his predecessor , @entity23 made headway on nuclear program negotiations with world powers earlier this year			0
even making use of social media , @entity23 tweets a softer image of the @entity19 presidency by posting pictures of himself in sweatpants watching @entity164 games			0
most importantly , @entity23 debuted his presidency with a message of economic openness and a desire to reintegrate @entity13 back into the international community			0
@entity13 's dismal human rights record still remains on the table , but the country 's open approach on economic issues may be human rights activists ' best chance to address political freedoms down the road			2
@entity13 's support of prime minister @entity181 's government and majority - ruling @entity182 in @entity2 puts @entity13 in a position that is aligned with @entity0 's geopolitical interests			1
what remains unclear is whether the current situation will give way to a stable partnership if the @entity2 crisis is contained			1
the @entity190 in 1986 demonstrated that the @entity0 could covertly set aside ideological differences for military advantage			0
however , as history has demonstrated , unlikely wartime bedfellows rarely equate to stable diplomatic policy			0
indeed , if history has taught the @entity0 anything , it 's that @entity13 is a resilient country with vast potential -- potential that expands far beyond merely oil , gas and guns			2
read : no , talking to @entity13 about @entity2 is n't desperation read : @entity0 and @entity13 : from sworn enemies to partners on @entity2 ?			1

@entity0 is aligning " awkwardly " with @entity13 as @entity2 crisis escalates , says @entity209
improvement in @entity13 relations may be only silver - lining to crisis , she adds
@entity209 : opportunity for partnership exists in @entity13 's budding technology market
possibility of @entity0 changing sanctions policy regarding @entity13 arouses *excitement* , she says
