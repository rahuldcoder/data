created by the @entity33 volcano 's 1912 eruption , it was the sight that so awed explorer @entity180			1
@entity68 recommends visitors spend a night camping there			0
" you have the volcanoes , the valley and beautiful uncluttered sky , " he says			0
" that intense solitude is available to just about everyone			0
" favorite spot to view wildlife : when @entity67 is slow for bear watching , @entity68 says experienced outdoor explorers should check out any place on the @entity195 where sedges , a grass - like plant that bears eat , grow above the high - tide line			2
there are pilots who will take you to @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 for bear watching during the spring and summer , he says			0

" watch a video of the showdown here @entity69 : @entity245 a ranger 's request : @entity40 is home to brown bears , which are the same species as grizzly bears but have different behavior patterns , says @entity68			1
keep at least a 50 - yard distance from all bears , which are solitary animals			1
you should never separate a mother from her cub , says @entity68			1
the mother will interpret the separation as a threat			2
since brown bears can move at speeds up 35 miles per hour , escape will be practically impossible			1
" a common misconception about @entity40 and @entity67 is that since they ( the bears ) do n't run , they 're tame or they like us , " says @entity68			1
