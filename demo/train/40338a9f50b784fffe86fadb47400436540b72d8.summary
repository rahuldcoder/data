a @entity3 family 's hope for an enjoyable outing high atop @entity0 ended abruptly when the group was escorted out of the @entity6 for saying @entity8 prayers , according to a lawsuit			1
@entity10 , his wife , @entity11 , and their two young children were at the skyscraper 's observation deck last july 2 shortly after 11 p.m. , a time when the family 's " religious beliefs require them to recite the evening prayers wherever they may be at the time , " according to a lawsuit filed in @entity23 on tuesday			1
the couple silently knelt in an isolated area of the observation deck , with little foot traffic , the court document said			2
while she managed to pray without incident , one guard interrupted and " menacingly poked " @entity10 " with his hands and feet several times in various parts of his body , " the court document said			2
the guard informed @entity10 he was not allowed to pray while at the observatory , and then " forcibly " escorted his family to the ground floor exit of the building , according to the court document			1
the suit names the @entity6 management company , the building , the security firm , and two unnamed security guards as defendants , alleging that they violated the first and 14 amendments as well as multiple state and city civil rights laws			1
the building is owned by a publicly traded company called @entity56			0
the family is seeking unspecified monetary damages			0
in response , an @entity56 spokeswoman , @entity59 , told @entity61 wednesday , " the claims are totally without merit and we will respond to them in court			1
" @entity67 , a lawyer for the the family , told @entity61 , " an unwritten rule or policy was being enforced by security when they removed these people			0
" " they were n't bothering anybody , they were out of the way , and for them to be thrown out of the building is just an ignorant and shameful exercise in discriminatory conduct , " @entity67 said			0
the couple was " shamed , humiliated and embarrassed in front of each other , their children , and the general public , " according to the lawsuit			0
the family released a brief statement through its attorney			2
" we were n't doing anything wrong , we just wanted to enjoy the view like everyone else , " the statement said			1
the alleged response to the incident drew criticism from other religious groups			0
@entity101 , president of the @entity102 , released a statement wednesday , which read in part : " muslims who pray in public , including in public accommodations , are simply exercising their constitutional rights			1
in play are two first amendment rights : freedom of speech and freedom of religion			0
we hope that @entity67 investigates the extent to which security guards are expected to censor religious speech			0
we wish him , and this innocent @entity8 couple , well			2
