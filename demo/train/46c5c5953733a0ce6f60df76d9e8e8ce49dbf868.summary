@entity0 -- a new report by the @entity3 says behavior detection techniques failed to lead authorities to at least 16 alleged terrorists who traveled through @entity8 airports			1
the @entity10 's program to use special officers to spot suspicious behavior began in 2003 , but the @entity3 questions the scientific basis and effectiveness of the techniques			1
the unclassified version of the report released thursday did not name the suspected terrorists who the @entity3 says were able to pass 23 times through airports where behavior detection officers work			1
but officials involved in crafting the report said the cases included that of @entity26 , a @entity27 shuttle driver who authorities said plotted to set off bombs in @entity31 's subway system			0
@entity26 pleaded guilty to providing material support to @entity33			0
the officials said the @entity10 also missed @entity34 , who pleaded guilty to scouting targets for the 2008 @entity37 , @entity38 , terror attacks and flew out of the @entity8 to do his reconnaissance			2
rep. @entity40 , @entity41 , suggested a 17th case : that of @entity43 , who allegedly plotted to blow up a car bomb in @entity45			0
@entity40 said it was a " @entity52 production " when @entity47 , being sought by authorities , tried to fly out of the @entity8 two days after that failed attack and was apprehended when he was already on a plane			0
@entity40 , the top @entity53 on the @entity54 , asked for the @entity3 report			0
although @entity40 supports behavior detection , he said the @entity10 has not carried out its program effectively			1
" it leads me to again call for reorganization of @entity10 , " @entity40 said at a @entity59 news conference			0
" @entity10 is an agency in total disarray			1
" @entity40 noted the agency has been without a permanent leader during the @entity65 administration and the president this week announced his third nomination for the post			0
the @entity3 report said between may 2004 and august 2008 detection techniques led to the arrests of more than 1,100 people but not because of suspected terrorism			2
instead the people were found to have committed drug or other offenses			0
a @entity10 statement called its program " a vital layer that enhances security at the nation 's airports			2
" it also noted the 2008 arrest in @entity85 , @entity86 , of a person carrying components for a pipe bomb			0
the @entity3 made a number of recommendations , including that @entity10 should have an independent panel of experts examine its scientific methods , and that @entity10 should do a cost - benefit analysis to see how effective behavior detection is compared with random screening and other methods			1
the @entity3 also said if there is airport video of any of the suspected or admitted terrorists , that would be a valuable tool for behavior detection officers to study			1
the @entity10 said it plans to implement a number of @entity3 's recommendations			2
@entity10 uses behavior detection as one of 20 layers of security protection			1
as of march about 3,000 of the specially trained officers were working in 161 @entity8 airports			1
the administration 's latest budget request calls for $ 232 million for the program .			0
