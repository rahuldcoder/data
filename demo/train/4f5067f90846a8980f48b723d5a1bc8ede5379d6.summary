-- the intentional breach of a levee on the @entity3 is sending 396,000 cubic feet per second of water onto 200 square miles of fertile @entity6 farmland			1
the @entity7 said the operation is helping to ease unprecedented flood pressure on other areas			1
while the plan appeared to be working -- the level of the @entity12 fell where it joins the @entity3 -- record crests and relentless pressure from millions of gallons of water still threatened communities throughout the @entity3 and @entity12 river valleys			1
@entity20 , @entity3 , could see water levels rise 4 feet by sunday			2
residents in @entity23 , @entity6 , were told sandbags may not be enough to control the water			1
@entity25 , of @entity26 , @entity6 , told @entity0 she grew up in @entity27 , @entity6 , which she said was being inundated by the breach on the @entity3			1
a tombstone rests above the remains of her father and uncle , but " i 'm sure we 'll never see it again , " said @entity25 , who claims residents of the rich farmland will be out of luck , as opposed to those in @entity40 , @entity41 , for whom the risk has been lessened by the breaches			2
" whoever thought it would be this bad ? " she said			2
the @entity7 reported river levels had fallen more than a foot since engineers detonated explosives late monday night at @entity52 , @entity6 , briefly illuminating the night sky like lightning and sending water coursing across a floodway that @entity6 gov. @entity57 described as " literally the most productive part of our continent			1
" the @entity12 level had dropped about 1.7 feet at @entity40 since monday afternoon , before the blast , but that is expected to level off wednesday and hover close to 60 feet the rest of the week			2
other sections showed modest decreases or no changes tuesday			2
@entity68 , @entity69 , on the @entity12 , is expected to see levels go from 54.7 feet tuesday night to 55.3 on sunday			2
a second levee blast was conducted tuesday afternoon at @entity72 , @entity6 , and a third is planned wednesday near @entity74 , @entity69			1
the second and third blasts , downstream of @entity52 , will allow floodwater to return to the @entity3			1
after the first blast late monday , the @entity77 lowered its crest projection for the @entity12 at @entity80 , @entity69 -- upriver from the levee breach -- to 55 feet from the previous 58 - foot prediction			1
but even that forecast is more than 3 1/2 feet higher than the record set at that location in 1997 , according to weather service records			1
flood stage there is 40 feet			2
the town of @entity40 remained under a mandatory evacuation despite the intentional breach , while six other communities were under voluntary evacuation notices , said @entity94 , spokeswoman for the @entity95			0
" we 're definitely not out of the woods yet , " she said			0
" the levees are all very saturated right now and they 're going to continue to have a lot of pressure on them for several days			1
" commercial shipping was affected by the levee blasting and subsequent debris removal			0
the segment at the confluence of the @entity3 and @entity12 rivers , near @entity40 , opened late tuesday afternoon , said @entity109 cmdr			0
two other @entity3 sections along the @entity6 - @entity69 border will reopen wednesday or later , she said			1
@entity110 did not know how many vessels were affected , but said companies had prepared for the closings			0
the @entity77 continues to predict record or near - record flooding in parts of southern @entity41 , southwest @entity119 , western @entity69 and @entity120 , southeastern @entity6 , northeastern @entity121 and , later , parts of @entity3 and @entity123			1
maj. gen. @entity124 , commander of the @entity125 , made the decision to order the breach			0
he warned that without punching a hole in the levee , massive flooding would threaten to inundate communities throughout the @entity3 and @entity12 river valleys			1
" there 's a tremendous amount of pressure on the system , " he told reporters tuesday evening			0
" the project operated as designed			0
" it was a controversial decision			0
@entity6 officials took the corps to court over the plan , questioning the agency 's authority to intentionally breach the levee			1
the state argued the floodwater would deposit silt on the 130,000 - some acres , and years , along with millions of dollars , would be required to fix the damage			2
the @entity151 @entity150 declined to intervene in the case on sunday , clearing the way for @entity155 's decision monday to blow the levee			0
some @entity6 residents were angered , arguing the decision would destroy their communities and provide questionable benefit			1
but others felt the decision was for the best			0
" yeah , we lost 135,000 acres of farm land here in @entity6 , " said @entity26 , @entity6 , resident @entity163 , who recently fled the drought and firestorms of @entity166 for what she thought would be a more peaceful life in the @entity169			1
" but how much more would we have lost if we had n't done it ? " the river diversion and other flooding has had an impact on pets and livestock			2
thirty - one animals rescued from flood waters in southeastern @entity6 are heading to @entity180 , including 24 domestic rabbits found abandoned inside a cotton gin trailer , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity183			1
@entity155 said the fate of @entity40 was just one of many factors in his decision , saying he hoped the move would alleviate problems throughout the @entity3 system			0
water levels and flooding have hit record highs in many spots , putting severe strains on systems meant to prevent uncontrolled floods and the resulting loss of life and property			1
he called the decision to inundate the farmland and about 100 homes " heart - wrenching			2
" " i 've been involved with flooding for 10 years and it takes a long time to recover from something like this , " he said			2
the governors of @entity41 and @entity6 said authorities in both states were prepared for the blasts and subsequent flooding , according to prepared statements			1
" i urge @entity217 to continue to cooperate fully with state , county and local law enforcement , as they have at every stage of this process , " @entity57 said			0
" together , we will ensure that @entity6 families stay safe in the coming days			1
and together , we will recover and rebuild			0
" a statement released by @entity41 gov. @entity226 's office called the decision to breach the levee " an important step to ensure public safety as we respond to this crisis			0
" even as the river was falling , @entity155 did not rule out similar moves elsewhere along the @entity3 and its tributaries , saying the levee system is under unprecedented pressure and warning water levels could rise again			0
" this does n't end this historic flood , " he said			0
evacuation notices have been posted in @entity119 , @entity69 and @entity120 , where rising tributaries have threatened dozens of communities			0
@entity69 gov. @entity244 visited three counties to assess response efforts			0
nearly 4,000 residents in the cities of @entity80 , @entity74 and @entity249 have been evacuated , according to a statement from his office			0
counties in central and northeast @entity121 were affected , including areas along the @entity256 rivers , said spokesman @entity257 of the @entity258 of @entity259			0
the mayor of @entity261 , @entity120 , urged residents of parts of his community to evacuate ahead of significant flooding there forecast for wednesday night , and residents and officials in @entity68 , @entity69 , were closely watching a levee holding back the @entity12 that has showed signs of failing			1
" we are in uncharted water , " @entity68 mayor @entity271 said			0
@entity0 's @entity274 contributed to this report .			0
