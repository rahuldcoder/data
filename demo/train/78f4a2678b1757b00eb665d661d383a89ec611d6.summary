it is a message of defiance , but also forgiveness -- and many @entity4 responded with similarly mixed emotions			1
it is a magazine cover depicting the @entity7 with a tear falling from his cheek , holding a sign that says , " @entity11 , " the slogan that became a worldwide meme			1
above @entity7 are the words " @entity15			0
" on wednesday , two @entity17 extremists attacked the offices of @entity19 , a @entity20 magazine with a history of mocking @entity7			1
twelve were killed , including several top editors , by two men with terrorist connections who said they were avenging the prophet			0
many @entity4 object to any depictions of @entity7 -- respectful or not -- saying that such images defy his teachings and lead to idolatry			1
for the secular satirists at @entity19 , neither of those concerns seemed to matter much			2
they often lampooned @entity7 , crudely caricaturing him as a backward , foolish figure			0
it 's not surprising that , in its first issue since the attack , @entity19 again put @entity7 on the cover			1
but this time , instead of showing the prophet in an unflattering light , the magazine struck a far different tone -- and was received by some @entity4 in a far different way			1
" my initial thought is that the cover is a near perfect response to the tragedy , " said @entity45 , a professor of @entity17 thought at @entity47 in @entity48			1
" they are not backing down from the depiction of @entity7 , exercising their free speech rights			0
at the same time , the message is conciliatory , humble , and will hopefully reduce the anger directed to the @entity17 communities of @entity20			1
" @entity59 , a columnist at @entity19 magazine who worked on the new issue , told the @entity62 that the staff did n't want to express hatred toward the terrorists who killed her colleagues			1
" the ( mobilization ) that happened in @entity20 after this horrible crime must open the door to forgiveness			2
everyone must think about this forgiveness			0
" chosen by @entity19 's editors on monday night , the cover was released by @entity74 , the @entity20 newspaper that is sharing its office space with staffers from the satirical magazine			1
many media outlets have republished the cover in a show of solidarity			2
the issue will hit newsstands this wednesday in a flood of 3 million copies translated into multiple languages			0
as the new cover spreads across social media , @entity4 responded with a mix of emotions , from wariness to appreciation , from miffed to dismissive			1
@entity92 , an imam in @entity93 , counseled his 100,000 @entity95 followers to follow the example of @entity7 , even if they encounter images that they believe are blasphemous			0
" as it is clear that the cartoons are to be published again , @entity4 will inevitably be hurt and angered , but our reaction must be a reflection of the teachings of the one we love & are angered for , " @entity92 said			2
" enduring patience , tolerance , gentleness and mercy was the character of our beloved @entity7			0
" on @entity109 , some @entity4 were skeptical that publishing an image that many consider offensive should be construed as an act of solidarity			2
other muslims said they appreciate the magazine 's sentiments			0
@entity45 noted that the cover 's central message -- forgiveness -- resonates not only throughout @entity17 but through other faiths as well			1
" the cover is a call to our better angels , and an acknowledgment that religion also offers good to the world			0
" other @entity17 leaders criticized the cover			1
" that the depiction appears benign is of little consequence because it will be seen as offensive and deliberately provocative , " said @entity131 , executive director of the @entity133 chapter of the @entity134			0
there 's nothing in the @entity140 , @entity17 's primary text , about depicting the prophet			2
but according to the hadith -- stories and sayings attributed to @entity7 and his companions -- he discouraged @entity4 from making images of him			2
@entity131 said that @entity19 's new cover " will offend many " but noted that " over 99.999 % of @entity20 's 5 million @entity4 acted peacefully when the previous depiction was released			1
" @entity151 , an @entity152 cleric with a wide following , said he 's not pleased by any depictions of @entity7 , but it 's clear that this @entity19 cover , unlike others , is not meant to make fun of @entity4			1
@entity151 also said that while he respects the right to free speech , there appears to be a double standard when it comes to what western society -- and @entity19 -- find suitable for mocking			2
" did you happen to notice any cartoons mocking the death of the cartoonists themselves , and lampooning their work and efforts ? " @entity151 asked			0
satire of the type attempted by @entity19 often serves a valuable end , said @entity174 , director of @entity17 studies at @entity176			1
but @entity174 faulted the @entity20 magazine for misfiring in its choice of targets			1
" i see satire as always having a purpose of mocking the powers that be , hierarchy , power , unearned privileged			0
so who are we speaking power to today ? " @entity174 said			0
" sure , violent terrorists			0
but what about all the other agents of violence , including the state - sponsored ones ? that 's why i do n't find @entity19 particularly good satire			2
" many @entity4 seemed content not to comment on @entity19 's latest depiction of their prophet , or to pay it no mind			1
" let us ignore the provocations and defamation and get about the work of being a source of good and mercy to all we may come into contact with , " @entity198 , a popular cleric and scholar from @entity200 , posted on @entity95 this week			0
" may @entity207 bless you all and make things easy for you and your families during these trying times			0
" @entity1 's @entity212 contributed to this report .			0

some @entity4 appreciate new @entity19 cover , while others are dismissive
professor : " my initial thought is that the cover is a near perfect response to the tragedy "
other @entity17 leaders say @entity20 magazine misfires in choice of satiric targets
