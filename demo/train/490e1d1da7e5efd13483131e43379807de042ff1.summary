-- @entity1 is dying of ovarian cancer			1
having exhausted all standard treatment options , her doctors say her best hope now is a new class of cancer drugs called @entity9 inhibitors			0
the @entity11 pharmaceutical company @entity10 makes one version of these drugs called @entity14			0
earlier this year , the company presented very early data on this experimental drug at a large cancer conference			2
initial results in women with breast and ovarian cancer were encouraging			1
@entity1 says there are doses of @entity25 sitting on shelves in the same hospital where she 's seeking treatment : @entity30			1
but she 's not getting the treatment because the company is refusing to give it to her			0
that 's because this drug she wants is still in clinical trials , and the company says has n't been proven effective			2
@entity10 points out that to date their drug has been tested in fewer than 30 patients with ovarian cancer like @entity1			1
" it would be unethical and reckless to provide end - stage refractory ovarian cancer patients outside a clinical trial with @entity14 at this early stage of development , " says company spokesperson @entity43			1
" if we did , we would be exposing an experimental drug to a large group without adequate testing			0
there have been previous circumstances where early access to large groups has resulted in adverse consequences that were worse than the course of the disease			0
" but @entity1 says she 's willing to accept the risks -- to roll the dice now that her doctors have tried everything else they can to save her life , including multiple rounds of surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation since she was first diagnosed with cancer in 2007			1
and her doctor supports her			0
she has the help of a @entity74 firm , working pro bono , to bring attention to her case , and a change.org petition for her cause has collected more than 150,000 supporters			0
it will likely be years before @entity14 is on the market , but @entity1 says she does not have that long to wait			2
@entity9 inhibitors work by preventing dna repair in cancer cells , and are thought to work especially well in patients with a particular gene mutation			0
" one of the reasons she 's such a great candidate for @entity9 inhibitors specifically is because she has a @entity92 mutation , " says dr. @entity88 , @entity1 's oncologist at @entity30			1
" she has a hereditary form of ovarian cancer , so we believe she has a much better chance of responding to @entity9 inhibitors than patients with a nonhereditary type of ovarian cancer			1
" @entity88 says @entity1 does n't meet the eligibility requirements for any open clinical trials to the best of his knowledge			2
if she did , he would not be seeking compassionate use for his patient in the first place , he says			1
@entity10 is conducting more clinical trials , but in breast cancer only , not ovarian cancer			1
the standoff between @entity1 and @entity10 raises the question : when should patients get access to experimental drugs ? under " @entity118 " or " @entity118 " , the @entity117 allows an unapproved drug still in development to go to a patient with few alternatives remaining , also absolving the drug maker of liability should the drug not work or cause harm			1
the @entity117 has said @entity1 qualifies to seek compassionate use of @entity14 , but @entity10 wo n't provide it and they do n't have to			1
" you have the @entity117 saying , ' look we 'll approve compassionate care			1
' you have the doctor who is the specialist saying : ' this is the right thing to do			0
' and you have a corporation protecting its wallet at the expense of @entity1 possibly dying , " says @entity133 , co-host of @entity0 's " crossfire , " who has been gathering support for @entity1 's case			1
" if you want to know why big companies often get bad names , it 's explaining that clerical support to fill out @entity117 paperwork is too difficult when you can save a life			1
" @entity10 says it does provide " expanded access " to patients for another drug which is further along in the clinical trial process , and that the company expects to spend $ 50 million or approximately 10 % of its revenue in 2013 on providing free drugs to patients			0
@entity10 also notes that other drug companies are developing @entity9 inhibitors too , so they 're not the only potential source for @entity1			2
the company points to an @entity162 clinical trial currently enrolling ovarian cancer patients , but @entity1 's doctor says she does n't qualify			1
" we 're focused on @entity10 because initially that is the one that one of my doctors had the most direct experience with and recommended , " says @entity1 , whose doctors at @entity30 also participate in @entity10 's clinical testing			2
" the compassionate use policy exists for exactly this situation , and this is how patients lose : i lose if @entity10 is able to say ' well you need to go ask for it from one of the other three ' , " says @entity1			2
@entity177 , professor of bioethics at @entity179 , says the scatter - shot way in which individual patients are left to petitioning drug companies for access to experimental drugs creates an unfair process			2
" one problem in this country is we have n't set up a system			0
right now what we 've got is a squeaky - wheel lottery ; if you can figure out what your options are , if you know how to use social media , if you know how to have a bake sale , if you can hire a pr firm -- you can have a shot at an unapproved drug , " says @entity177			2
" but that 's all obviously inequitable relative to the number of people who might want to seek compassionate use			0
" @entity177 says that without more safety and efficacy data on @entity10 's drug , it 's too early in the process for a compassionate use exception for a different form of cancer than the one @entity10 is targeting			1
there 's still a big risk that the drug could harm @entity1 , speeding her death , as much as it helps her , he says			1
@entity1 's doctor agrees the system needs changing			1
" my own belief is that the drug companies , the manufacturers , the insurance companies , the providers like my hospital @entity30 , the individual medical professionals , the investigators , the patients -- everybody wants the same things			0
safe , effect , novel therapies for as many people as it 's appropriate for , " says @entity88			0
" even @entity10 , i believe			0
i do n't think this is like ' let the masses eat cake			0
' i think they 're on the same mission			0
but the whole system is giving this dysfunctional result			0
" @entity88 says the window for @entity1 is closing			0
if it 's going to be effective , she will need the new drug soon			0
knowledge of that fact has put @entity1 on a mission , and she says she 's not giving up .			2

@entity1 , *45* , has ovarian cancer
she is seeking " compassionate use " of a new drug that 's not @entity117 - approved
@entity1 says she 's willing to accept the risks
