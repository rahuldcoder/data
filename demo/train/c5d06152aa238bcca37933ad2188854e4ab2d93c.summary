when i was first diagnosed with @entity1 -- a brain disorder involving structural defects -- i was shocked			1
after learning more about it , and then after successful surgery in 2011 , i realized that i could emerge a stronger person , both mentally and physically			1
today i am able to continue to compete at the highest level in the sport of luge and continue to live life to the fullest			1
i remain committed to my sport as well as to sharing my story about overcoming challenges			1
during my surgery , and in times of adversity , the most important thing for me has been the support of my awesome family and friends			1
i had a new outlook on the sport when i returned to competition in 2012			2
while i knew my @entity23 was never going to be gone completely , i was healthier than i had ever been and ready to see what i could do as an athlete , free of my symptoms			2
i never wanted to use my @entity23 as an excuse not to do something , and i am thankful to my medical team for encouraging and supporting me to continue my athletic endeavors			2
in my first season back , i had my best results ever			2
i won my first national title , scored eight top - 10 finishes in the @entity35 -- including my first - ever silver medal in front of a home crowd in @entity39 , @entity40			2
i also achieved a personal best , placing sixth in the overall @entity35 rankings			0
i refuse to let my @entity23 define or limit me as a person			1
from the very first day i was diagnosed , i decided that i was going to recover from this and i set to work making a plan on how i was going to do it			1
in addition to recovering physically , i am extremely proud of the work i have done in my home state of @entity50 by reaching out to youth on an emotional level , educating them about my personal challenges and encouraging them to go after their dreams			0
since 2010 , i 've been the spokeswoman for the @entity58			0
during the past four years , i 've been reaching out to @entity50 high school students			0
my presentations are 20 minutes long , and include a video and my personal story of overcoming challenges , including my neck surgery and the passing of my father and sister , as well as the athletic challenges i have faced in my life			1
i also share with them the importance of individual responsibility and good decision - making			0
as part of my work with the @entity58 , i have been to 34 high schools in @entity50 and reached more than 9,000 students			0
my goal is to reach as many as 10,000 students in the next few months , and perhaps develop the @entity58 responsibility initiative into a national model			0
some of the most rewarding experiences of my life have come from my work to inspire young people			0
this is one of the biggest reasons that i am proud to host @entity88 's @entity87 each summer			1
the camp is designed for young girls ages 8 to 11 as a place to develop self - confidence and a healthy lifestyle			0
i have been blessed with the opportunity to share my experiences with young girls and give them the strength and confidence to go after their dreams .			0
