@entity0 -- a federal appeals court in @entity0 thursday struck down the @entity4 voter id law requiring photos for voters at the polls , calling it racially discriminatory			1
the decision is a major victory for the @entity11 administration and its @entity13 allies , which had challenged the law			0
@entity4 attorney general @entity15 promptly announced the state will appeal the ruling to the @entity18			1
@entity20 gov. @entity19 signed the voter id measure into law last year , but it had yet not gone into effect because the federal @entity24 requires changes in @entity4 voting laws to be pre-cleared by the @entity27			1
attorney general @entity28 denied the pre-clearance of the measure in march , concluding that @entity4 failed to show the law will not have " the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race			1
" the three - judge panel agreed			0
although the law provides for approved voter registration certificates with no photo as acceptable for voting in certain circumstances , the court said the law imposes " strict unforgiving burdens on the poor			2
" the court noted the requirements will fall heavily on african - americans and @entity48 , who make up a disproportionate percentage of the poor in @entity4			2
the panel of judges for the @entity53 also said it was ruling only on the @entity4 law , and not issuing a statement about other state voting laws			1

@entity15 , meanwhile , said @entity4 will immediately take the case to the nation 's highest court , where " we are confident we will prevail			2
" he said the @entity18 had already approved similar ballot integrity safeguards passed in @entity59 and @entity86			2
the ruling comes as another three - judge panel in @entity0 is hearing arguments this week on a similar law passed in @entity91			0

@entity13 claim there is no voter fraud issue , and that the laws are designed to reduce voting by poor minorities			0
