-- whenever anything involves the " @entity4 " franchise , there are certain expectations that need to be met to satisfy die - hard , and even casual , fans			2
so when a new video game wants to bring " @entity4 " to life like never before , that 's setting the bar really high			2
" @entity14 " tries to use the power of the @entity13 controller for the @entity15 to put players into the action , using full - body motions to wield lightsabers , drive podracers and , unfortunately , dance for @entity22			1
the game has a few high points but also has more disappointments than a bad motivator on a defective @entity28 unit			2
there are five sections to the game , offering different styles of gameplay and a complete campaign in each			1
one section , @entity35 , is locked at the very beginning , but quickly unlocks after players complete the first mission in the @entity39 section			1
@entity39 is where players learn how to use their body movements to control the @entity42 and use their lightsaber			1
players start out as training @entity45 ( those who are just learning how to use the force ) and are quickly thrust into a conflict with the @entity48			1
when the @entity13 controller works , the actions are seamless and fluid			1
the animations look somewhat similar to what you 'd see in a " @entity4 : @entity58 " cartoon , which means they are easy on the eyes and familiar			2
force actions are fun to use			1
grabbing a battle droid with the @entity42 and flinging it into a group of its mates is quite enjoyable			2
however , when the @entity13 controller failed to read my actions properly , no amount of flailing in front of my screen would alleviate my frustration			1
more often than not , i could n't control the action as well as i would have liked , and i ended up many times just wading into groups of enemies and waving my lightsaber around			1
there are times during @entity39 when you control a speeder , gun turret or x-wing fighter for battles , but the controls seem sluggish and make it difficult to accurately pinpoint shots			1
@entity86 was probably the most fun out of all the segments			0
players act as a freed rancor ( remember him ? the monster in the pit at @entity22 's lair ? ) and get to smash people , droids and buildings with abandon			1
here is where flailing about actually works to your advantage			0
the rancor smashes the ground to level opponents , charges through buildings with abandon and , yes , eats people to gain health			0
the controls felt responsive to the appropriate moves , providing the best one - to - one movement experience out of all the game segments			0
the podracing section is pretty straightforward			0
players act as the driver and use their motion to control speed , direction and ramming abilities			1
the storyline occurs years after @entity118 won his race in " @entity120 : @entity120 , " but many of the characters are still around and add some great dialogue in between races			0
the feel of being in a podracer is well animated and would be fun , except that holding your arms out continually to control your racer gets tiring and painful			2
the races are rather long , and you 'll need to take breaks often just to rest your shoulders			0
@entity133 is the least " @entity4 " - like segment of the entire game			0
it is pretty much any @entity13 dancing game , given a " @entity4 " coating			1
modern dance songs are slightly tweaked to include " @entity4 " characters or plot points			0
some of the dance moves are named after force moves , and even iconic characters are dragged onto the dance floor			2
from a straight gameplay perspective , the dancing works and will be enjoyable to those who like those games			2
for someone hoping to have a " @entity4 " experience , the @entity133 is best avoided			0
it seemed to be more game padding than substance			0
duels of @entity156 puts you in one - on - one lightsaber battles with different foes from " @entity4 " lore , advancing your way through the ranks to face off against the dark lord himself , @entity118			0
if any part of the game was going to appeal to fans , it was going to be this one			0
however , this segment is plagued by the same problems found in @entity39			1
the motions appear off at times , it is hard to string together actions for a successful hit , and the feel of the action is less than enjoyable			0
overall , " @entity14 " has so much going on that it 's is likely to have something that appeals to almost any style of gamer			1
it is just unfortunate that the two areas where the gameplay actually works best are the two segments that do the worst job representing the " @entity4 " canon			2
maybe we expect too much from a " @entity4 " title when we want it to reflect exactly what we 've seen in the movies and television			0
maybe our imagination 's desire to put ourselves in the place of @entity198 or @entity199 ca n't successfully be translated into a video game			0
the right ideas are here for what could have been a fulfilling experience			0
however , the @entity13 controller , for all the good that it does in other titles , lets the player down and does n't see through with the promise of a new hope for the gamer / fan experience			1
" @entity14 " is available now exclusively for the @entity15 and can be played only using the @entity13 controller			1
it is rated " @entity216 " because of mild language , mild suggestive themes and violence			0
this review was done playing on the @entity15 with the @entity13 controller .			1

there are five sections to " @entity14 , " offering different styles of gameplay
@entity39 is where players learn how to use their body movements to control the force
