-- in yet another blow to the already ailing soap opera world , @entity1 , the venerable star of @entity3 ' " @entity2 , " has exited the top - rated daytime drama after a nasty negotiation with @entity8			1
@entity1 's last episode as @entity10 will air on november 2			1
the production company wanted the popular actor to take a pay cut for playing mega mogul @entity10 , but @entity1 -- who 's been on the soap since 1980 -- opted to leave instead			1
barring any last - minute change , @entity1 's final episode will air on november 2			1
reps for @entity8 and @entity3 had no comment , though one insider indicated that no further talks are planned			0
@entity0 talked with @entity1 , 68 , about @entity8 's decision to exercise a draconian clause in his contract ( his deal that was set to expire in november 2010 can still be renegotiated every 26 weeks ) and what it means to the future of daytime dramas			1
@entity0 : where do things stand ? did your representative counter @entity8 's offer and you have yet to hear an answer ? @entity1 : precisely			1
@entity0 : as of today , are you willing to take what @entity8 offered ? @entity1 : no. there is no appreciation of the fact that i 've been an important part of the show for 27 years that has been no. 1 in the ratings			1
so to be dealt with in a perfunctory matter as if you had just known these people for a few months is what is most offensive			0
this is a certain corporate culture now that is very deleterious			0
@entity0 : is it true you offered to take a pay cut before ? @entity1 : i was the first one [ to offer ] because i knew that if we all did it , we would insure the continuation of the show			1
i did it two years ago when i signed my last contract , which i thought would last until next november			1
@entity0 : did you say your on - set goodbyes ? @entity1 : i said this could be a long goodbye , and i may not see you for a long time			1
who knows ? i 'm not saying i 've been let go -- we 're still negotiating			2
but it feels like that			0
@entity0 : what does this say about the state of the industry when a production company is asking the star of the no. 1 show in daytime to take a pay cut ? should everyone be worried ? @entity1 : yes , though it depends on what the star does			1
all options are open right now			0
what can i tell you ? i know there are certain economic realities that dictate the actions they are taking right now , but the manner in which its being done is most insulting			2
@entity0 : you taped your last episode on september 23			2
was that the way you wanted @entity10 to go ? @entity1 : no. it was rushed			1
it was obviously meant to intimidate			0
it was obviously done with enormous forethought to coincide with the end of the 26 - week cycle			0
essentially that is what the business is doing now and has been doing for a while			0
and quite frankly , it 's outrageous			2
when i sign a three - year deal , i 'm obligated to fulfill that deal			0
the producers , however , can come to me after a half - year and say , " we 've changed our minds			2
" where in the world of business does this kind of contract exist ? do i blame the people for wanting to squeeze as much out of us as they can ? i do not			2
the question is , when do you squeeze too much ? @entity0 : would you do another daytime drama ? @entity1 : i doubt that			1
never say never in this business or in life , but i doubt that			0
@entity0 : can you see the genre still existing in 10 years ? @entity1 : yes i can			1
how many reality shows can you watch ? they 're so obviously phony			0
our show deals with adult problems in a long continuous manner , and very much like the way things are dealt with in real life			2
in that sense i think there will always be a need for ( soaps )			0
they 're almost novelistic in their approach			0
