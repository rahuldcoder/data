-- there 's nothing like a romantic kiss			1
it is the climax of every great love story and an experience that has motivated poets and musicians for thousands of years			2
it 's also a wonderful example of a behavior that is both nature and nurture			2
humans have an instinctive drive to connect through kissing , but the style and expression is shaped by our culture and personal experiences			2
beneath the surface , a kiss serves as the ultimate litmus test for a relationship			1
it can urge us to pursue a deeper connection with someone special or act as a warning to back off when something just does n't feel right			1
science is finally beginning to unravel the mystery of how this happens			1
while we do n't often think of them in this way , human lips are the body 's most exposed erogenous zone			1
packed with sensitive nerve endings , even a light brush sends a cascade of information to our brains helping us to decide whether we want to continue and what might happen next			2
lip contact involves five of our 12 cranial nerves as we engage all of our senses to learn more about a partner			2
electric impulses bounce between the brain , lips , tongue and skin , which can lead to the feeling of being on a natural " high " because of a potent cocktail of chemical messengers involved			1
opinion : why i hate @entity57 a passionate kiss acts like a drug , causing us to crave the other person thanks to a neurotransmitter called dopamine			1
this is the same substance involved in taking illegal substances such as cocaine , which is why the novelty of a new romance can feel so addictive			0
dopamine is involved in sensations of reward , making us feel intense desire that can lead to feelings of euphoria , insomnia , and loss of appetite , and it is only one actor in the great chemical ballet happening in our bodies			1
and then there are physical changes			0
a kiss can cause our blood vessels to dilate , our pulse to quicken and cheeks to flush			1
our pupils grow wide , which is likely one reason that so many of us are apt to close our eyes			0
in other words , the body 's response mirrors many of the same symptoms frequently associated with falling in love			1
photos : ' @entity96 ' -- romance in @entity98 but let 's be honest ; not every kiss leaves us wanting more			1
evolutionary psychologists at @entity103 at @entity104 recently reported that 59 % of men and 66 % of women say that they have ended a budding relationship because of a bad kiss			1
how is it that such a seemingly simple exchange has the power to influence attraction dramatically ? we can readily describe sensations of butterflies in the stomach or feeling weak in the knees when things go well , but we are less aware of the ways that kissing helps us to make a reliable assessment of another person			0
an often - overlooked organ that 's intimately involved in the experience is the nose			0
beyond obvious mood spoilers such as poor hygiene and bad breath , we each have a distinct natural scent that appears to guide us toward choosing a partner with compatible dna			0
scientists have found that women prefer the scents of men with a complementary set of genes that code for the immune system			0
the benefit may be that if children come along down the line , they would be well - equipped to ward off disease			0
of course , some people worry about the way that a kiss also puts us in very close proximity to another person 's germs			1
but in reality , we 're more likely to get sick by shaking hands throughout the day than by kissing			0
it 's necessary to include one important caveat : there seems to be a rise in the number of young people biting each other to express affection			0
this may be due , in part , to vampires in @entity164 making the exchange look extremely good on the big screen			0
however , biting your loved ones is the least appropriate way to show you care because injecting potentially dangerous viruses and bacteria directly into someone 's blood stream can be deadly			0
blood - sucking aside , kissing allows us to cross normal social boundaries and get close enough for a reliable sample of scent , taste and possibly pheromones providing insight into long - term compatibility			0
in other words , there 's more to a kiss than meets the lips			2
we may not be actively aware of all of the significant ways our bodies respond , but kisses are powerful clues to evaluate when to pursue a relationship and when to move on			2
fortunately , understanding the real chemistry involved does n't take any of the magic out of the moment , but it might boost the odds of leaving a lasting impression			0
