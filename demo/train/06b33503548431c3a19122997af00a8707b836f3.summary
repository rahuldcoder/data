@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the window opened for @entity1 's latest rocket launch opened thursday morning , the nation 's neighbors were watching developments at the remote base nervously			1
@entity10 patriot missile defense systems scanned the clear skies in @entity12 and an air base in @entity14 , underlining the regional tensions			1
'' we would like to call ( on @entity1 ) for restraint until the very end , " @entity10 prime minister @entity19 said outside his office as he arrived thursday , according to news agency @entity21			1
he added , " we are fully prepared to deal with any contingency , " the news agency reported			1
@entity10 has threatened to shoot down the @entity1 rocket if it is seen threatening its territory			1
@entity25 has described the move as a " grave provocation " and says it will respond with " appropriate countermeasures			1
" the announcement last month of the satellite launch -- which countries like the @entity32 and @entity25 see as a cover for a ballistic missile test -- ratcheted up tensions in the region and prompted @entity37 to suspend a recent deal to supply food aid to the @entity1			1
" this launch will give credence to the view that @entity1 leaders see improved relations with the outside world as a threat to the existence of their system , " @entity32 secretary of state @entity40 said in a speech tuesday			2
" and recent history strongly suggests that additional provocations may follow			0
" the @entity53 and @entity25 have ordered commercial planes and fishermen to stay clear of the rockets proposed path over the next few days			2
@entity1 has said that it plans to launch its rocket sometime between thursday and monday , between the hours of 7 a.m. and noon ( 6 p.m. -11 p.m. wednesday - sunday in the @entity32 @entity59 )			1
@entity1 says it has started fueling a long - range rocket in final - stage preparation , a senior national space official said wednesday			2
fueling will be completed at the " appropriate time , " said @entity65 , head of the @entity66 and @entity67			0
he declined to be more specific			0
@entity1 says the rocket will put a satellite in orbit			0
a recent report from @entity25 intelligence officials claimed that @entity1 is planning a new nuclear test in the area where it staged previous atomic blasts			1
the report noted that the two previous rocket launches that @entity0 said were intended to put satellites into orbit were followed a few weeks or months later by nuclear tests			0
international leaders have urged @entity1 to cancel the launch , but @entity0 has refused to back down , insisting that the operation is for peaceful purposes			2
the last time @entity0 carried out what it described as a satellite launch , in april 2009 , the @entity84 condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated			2
the announcement of the fueling was made on the same day as a conference of the @entity1 ruling @entity91 that began to cement the position of the secretive state 's new leader			2
@entity1 television showed a somber @entity98 standing beneath two towering statues of his father and grandfather while receiving applause from party functionaries and the military			2
the meeting of party delegates and the controversial launch come as the nation prepares to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of @entity112 , the founder of @entity1 who ruled the communist state for more than four decades			0
his birthday on april 15 , known as the " @entity116 , " is a key public holiday in the @entity1 calendar			0
at the conference , the late former leader @entity119 was given an everlasting title			0
he is now eternal general secretary of the @entity122			0
current leader @entity98 was named the first secretary of the @entity122			1
the title appears to be a newly created position that sets the table for a virtual coronation of @entity98 , says @entity1 watcher @entity128 of the @entity37 - based @entity129			1
" creating this new position is sort of like retiring a jersey number for a famous baseball player , " said @entity128			0
" it shows a deference to his father and to the old guard , while still cementing his control on power			0
" @entity1 announced several other titles for @entity98 , including making him a member of the @entity141 of the @entity142 and chairman of the @entity144			1
@entity98 is already described as the supreme leader of the party , state and army			1
but it is still unclear how directly the young @entity112 , thought to be in his late 20s , is involved in policy decisions			0
" this move fully parallels what happened with his father , " said @entity128			0
" @entity119 is now venerated at the same level as his father , buried in the same tomb and they are making statues of them riding together on horseback			0
" " but @entity98 never got the on - the - job training his father did , so he may have this title to allow some mentoring or sharing power and decisions with his elders			1
" @entity2 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
