-- there were once seven words you could n't say on television , as the late comedy icon @entity6 famously lampooned 40 years ago			0
now it appears there are more than 500 words you should n't say on @entity10 or @entity11 unless you want to be flagged by the @entity12			1
there is a surveillance program the agency quietly began in february 2011 to monitor social media , according to the @entity17			1
documents obtained only after the privacy organization filed a lawsuit to enforce its @entity23 request reveal that anything you post on social - media websites such as @entity10 and @entity11 could come under review by the @entity12 , or at least by @entity28 , the military defense contractor hired to implement the surveillance program			1
like the probes in the movie " @entity32 , " they are looking for " @entity33 , " which in this case are words on a watch list that are considered " bad			2
" so what words are of interest to them ? are they like the seven words that @entity6 joked about not being able to say on television because they " ... will infect your soul , curve your spine and keep the country from winning the war			0
" ( by the way , if @entity6 tweeted these words today , he would get noticed because the word " infection " is part of the watch list			0
) no , @entity6 's joke dealt with curse words , which are actually now heard nightly on cable tv			0
in contrast , the @entity12 is concerned with a broader range of words that you can say on television , or anywhere , usually without a problem			1
however , if you tweet or post these specific words on social - media websites , then you 'll catch the attention of the security agency			1
the watch list includes hundreds of words and phrases that have been organized into certain categories : domestic security , @entity72 , health concern , @entity75 border violence , federal agencies , terrorism , weather / disaster / emergency , cybersecurity and infrastructure security			0
two questions jump out regarding this surveillance program			1
how effective is it ? and more importantly , is this an invasion of our privacy ? the effectiveness question is hard to answer			1
when you look at all the words on the watch list , it 's hard to believe that any terrorist or criminal would tweet or post them unless they wanted to get caught			0
for example , the watch list contains words such as dirty bomb , hostage , @entity101 and ammonium nitrate			0
what terrorist in his right mind would tweet , " looking for ammonium nitrate , please direct message me if you have leads ? " there are also terms under the category " @entity75 border violence " that seem ridiculous , such as heroin , cocaine , methamphetamine , meth lab and drug war			0
if a drug dealer mentioned on his @entity11 wall , " great deal today on heroin and methamphetamine , and it 's all organically made in my own meth lab , " i would hope that people would turn that person in -- or at the very least , not " like " his post			2
but it 's the long list of innocent words on the watch list that raises more concerns			0
words such as subway , delays , infection , @entity138 , cloud , pork , wave and @entity142 are monitored			0
if you posted on @entity10 , " i 'm going on vacation to @entity138 , hope no clouds because want to catch some waves , " your tweet would be considered suspicious because you used three words on the watch list			2
in the event that your @entity11 or @entity10 post is flagged , a further investigation could be triggered , and information could be shared with other government agencies			1
as a former attorney , i am fully aware that you have little grounds to claim that your postings on @entity11 and @entity10 have an expectation of privacy			1
social media is almost the equivalent of speaking loudly at a crowded party -- people beyond your intended recipients will hear your words			2
however , putting the legality issues aside , we should be concerned the government is engaged in the wholesale monitoring of our social - media streams			1
this program is akin to the @entity174 government 's monitoring of the @entity175			2
our government must not emulate an authoritarian regime			0
we should reject the notion that tweeting words included in the watch list , such as @entity138 or clouds , justifies monitoring our activities on social - media platforms			1
if we do n't object now to the unfettered surveillance of our social - media communications , the next step could be the government 's reading of our direct messages on @entity11 and @entity10			1
following that , the reading of our personal e-mails would not be far behind			0
since 9/11 , we have far too often willingly forfeited privacy in the name of security , be it the @entity197 , the @entity199 's spying of @entity200 , body - scanning machines , intrusive pat - downs at airports and who knows what else is out there that we have yet to find out about			2
if it were not for the @entity17 's lawsuit , we would be unaware of the details of this latest program			2
@entity208 famously warned us , " any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both			0
" the @entity12 's surveillance program -- and our acceptance of programs like it -- is just another step in the direction that @entity208 so wisely cautioned us to guard against			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			0

the @entity12 *reportedly* is monitoring social - media websites
surveillance program looks for " bad " words on @entity11 and @entity10 , lawsuit reveals
@entity222 asks how effective is this program , and is it an invasion of our privacy ?
@entity222 says this program may open the door to more intrusive types of surveillance
