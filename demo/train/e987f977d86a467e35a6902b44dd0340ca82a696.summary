@entity0 -- staring down a smoking homemade bomb and dismantling it is dangerous enough			1
doing it with news cameras rolling on a busy saturday night in the middle of @entity6 is something @entity8			1
@entity9 of the @entity10 swears never entered his mind			2
" you 're home the next day , and you 're really thinking about it			2
then , you start to put the pieces together and you think , ' wow , ' " @entity9 said in an exclusive interview			0
@entity9 was manipulating the police robot that laid the groundwork for one of his partners , @entity8			0
" this was the first time that i went down on a vehicle , and i saw clocks and wires and gas and propane			0
i identified it as a bomb , and i had to look twice , " @entity20 said			1
after 13 years as a bomb tech , that night was the one @entity20 says he 'll remember the most			1
@entity20 and @entity9 are part of @entity0 's elite bomb squad , a unit whose size is a closely guarded secret			1
@entity1 was given special access to the unit in order to find out what a more typical day can be like			1
during one recent 16 - hour shift , i watched the same five - man team who worked the bungled bomb plot in @entity6 check their equipment , catch up on paperwork and make sure @entity47 , their explosives - sniffing dog , was raring to go			1
the @entity51 is named for a member of the squad who died in the 9/11 attacks when one of the twin towers collapsed			2
on a busy side street outside their @entity61 offices , neighbors watched them go through their paces with the robot			0
" we think they 're great , " one man said			0
another passerby snapped a picture of the robot with her cell phone			0
" is that the robot that checks out bombs ? " she asked			0
but robots , as sophisticated as they are , can only do so much			0
they 're capable of blowing out windows , blasting a suspicious package to bits , photographing an object from several angles and sending those images to investigators			0
the squad does n't want to publicize more specific details			2
still , a human touch often ca n't be avoided			0
with help , bomb techs first crawl into an 85 - pound protective suit that covers their bodies from head to toe			1
the feet nearly look like those of a platypus , the material is stiff and hot , and the chest plate is heavy			0
a helmet is cinched on around the neck , and an air hose keeps outside air flowing into the mask			0
put on gloves , and it 's hard to imagine that anyone in such bulky gear could maneuver and dismantle possible bomb components			1
but that 's what they 're trained to do			2
" the more you do , and the more you get involved , the better you 'll get when it 's the real thing , " @entity20 said			2
@entity113 also was there for the " real thing " in @entity6			1
he said his training kicked in			0
" there 's a strong bond between us			1
we go to a job , there 's very little talk			2
everyone knows what they have to do , " he said			0
despite the immense dangers associated with the work , whenever the unit checks out a suspicious package , bomb technicians jockey for the opportunity to suit up			1
" we actually have arguments over who 's taking the job , " added @entity113			1
when @entity1 traveled with them on a call , it was @entity113 's turn to wear the gear			1
the bomb squad was called to check out a backpack found in a park near a police headquarters checkpoint			1
the team sped to the scene with sirens screaming			0
other units ringed the perimeter			0
this time , he determined that this time , there was nothing to it			0
sgt. @entity154 said it 's necessary to assume the worst until the team moves in			2
" everything is a bomb until we say it 's not a bomb , " said @entity154			1
the days are long , but the men say they feel " blessed " to be part of the bomb squad			1
they laugh when people suggest they must be a little crazy to do such a dangerous job			0
" it 's an honor , " @entity9 said			2
and it never gets old			0
" at the end of the day , it 's just one day down and a lot more to go , " said @entity8			2
@entity1 producers @entity172 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			1
