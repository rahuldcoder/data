-- @entity1 held up the pants in the tiny dressing room and shook his head			1
there 's no way , he thought			2
no way i 'm at a size 48			1
@entity1 was fresh out of college , recently married and just starting his career as a technology coordinator for a local school district			1
i refuse to go any bigger than 46 , he thought vehemently			2
" unfortunately , that day i did have to buy those [ pants ] , " @entity1 remembers			1
" but i did n't go any higher than that			2
" @entity1 always had an excuse for his obesity as a young adult			1
the self - described " stocky " man was just big - boned , he told himself			2
in reality , he weighed close to 300 pounds			1
" it was n't like we were stopping on the way home at @entity26 's every night -- it was just portion sizes , " @entity1 says			1
" the easiest thing in the world [ for me ] is to eat			2
i 'm a food guy			2
" but that day in a badly - lit discount clothing store in @entity34 , something clicked			1
he walked back over to his wife , @entity35 , who looked unhappy with her clothing selections as well			2
they decided right then to make a change			1
" we said , ' look , this is it			0
let 's not kid around anymore			0
" got your own weight loss story to share ? visit @entity45 the couple went home and borrowed a few @entity49 books from a relative and began to eat less			0
" the first month , i was starving , " @entity1 says			1
" after the first month it was easier			0
it 's still not easy today , but it 's easier			0
" @entity1 and @entity35 also started walking laps around a park near their house			1
it was n't exactly fun , but he did n't know what else to do to get active			0
after a few weeks he jogged one lap. then two			0
as he lost weight it got easier to jog and a couple of laps turned into a couple of miles			0
he did n't slow down until he reached 200 pounds			2
now @entity1 runs five days a week -- on mondays it 's a long run of six to eight miles ; the rest of the days he does about four			1
on may 1 he completed the 10 - mile @entity68 in @entity69 in a time of 1 hour and 22 minutes			1
he does n't count calories but eats small meals for breakfast and lunch : cereal and a banana in the morning ; yogurt and an orange around noon			0
dinner he plans ahead of time -- splurging on friday night when he takes time off from running to share pizza and cookies with his wife			0
he weighed in last week at 174 pounds			1
like in any weight loss attempt , there were setbacks			0
in 2007 @entity1 had reached 220 pounds			1
a " @entity88 " - type contest at school helped him drop down to 170			1
when he posted his story on @entity45 in march , he weighed 193.5 pounds			1
" i 'm not ashamed to say my weight goes up and down ... it 's a constant fight , " @entity1 said in a phone interview last month			1
" i 'm looking at a bowl of cookies that are right across from me and i kind of want one			0
fortunately , the phone cord does n't reach that far			0
" " there 's no way i 'm going to sit at a @entity100 table and not eat anything ... i consider myself a foodie and for as long as i live i will never have that type of [ fear ] relationship with food -- i enjoy it too much			0
i will not deprive myself because of a pound or two			0
" he hopes his daughter @entity109 grows up to appreciate food like he does , without ever having to worry about battling the scale			0
so he 's setting a good example early			0
" i 'm trying to avoid putting all the pressure on the food aspect			0
i say that tongue - in - cheek , but it 's important			2
the thing that 's worked best for me is getting off my butt			0
" @entity1 continues to write about his weight loss journey on his blog , @entity122 .			2
