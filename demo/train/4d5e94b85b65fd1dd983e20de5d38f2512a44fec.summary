at best , the word networking conjures up images of standing awkwardly at a party , delicately balancing a drink in one hand while you exchange cards with someone you will probably never see again			1
at worst , it brings to mind a hustler who thrusts their card aggressively in your face with barely a hello uttered , all the while scanning over your shoulder for someone more important			1
not surprisingly , the very idea is enough to strike terror into the hearts of most introverted workers , who do n't relish the idea of walking into a room full of strangers and striking up conversations			1
but cleverly done , networking can reap huge benefits for career success , says the @entity30 's renowned " networking queen " and " professor of schmooze " @entity31			1
@entity31 , who was recently appointed visiting professor in networking at @entity35 , at @entity36 , @entity37 , says in an increasingly global workforce , workers can not afford to ignore the competitive edge it can give			1
see also : to reach the top , do what others wo n't previously perceived as a " soft " skill , " @entity31 , who also runs networking business @entity50 , says effective networking will make the difference " between a highly skilled worker and an average worker			1
" " i think professional workers and their employers are going to come to appreciate and understand networking as more of a hard skill than a soft skill , " she says			1
" we take for granted now that certain types of qualifications have to be achieved , and in this global marketplace , where a worker in @entity66 , or a worker in @entity68 , or a worker in @entity70 or @entity37 , is directly competing with workers they 've never met , what will give them the edge is the knowledge skills			1
" below is an edited version of the full interview with @entity31			1
@entity77 : why do you emphasize networking more than leadership ? @entity31 : i think the word leadership is overused and possibly overrated			1
what matters is that people feel productive and stimulated			0
the trouble with the emphasis on leadership is that it is aspirational but is not always achieved			0
the point about networking is everybody can be more productive , everybody can be stimulated and everybody can be more engaged			2
see also : why we pick bad leaders so it 's not that i want to dismiss leadership , but what i am saying is that we are in a new era , in which we are all islands surrounded by oceans of information and oceans of possibilities and entire oceans of people we might need			2
the ability to navigate and chart through those oceans is the skills that we are providing			0
and that 's what i am interested in , part of it , is that i would like everybody to love what they do and how they do it			2
and lots of corporate individuals that we meet expressed a sense of isolation and alienation			0
@entity77 : why do they experience that ? @entity128 : they are isolated and the networking they do is largely confined to an old model of a pretty large - scale event , like walking into a room and standing up in the corner			1
we find the best networking style is in a relaxed environment , where you have a moment to actually look into somebody 's face and think , " do i trust what i am seeing here ? " that 's one of the reasons that women are very good at networking , because we are more naturally blended into our personal and professional personas			1
that is the shift -- it is not that one does not need to have boundaries and limits , but it is actually ok and will be normal to be more personal than not , in a professional environment			0
because we are persons and personalities			0
@entity77 : how has social media impacted on traditional networking -- has it made it more effective or the opposite ? @entity128 : i think it assisted it in some ways but it has also shown up its own limitations			2
the word that matters , that people are frightened of and might even be surprised to see , i suppose , in a work or business context , is intimacy			0
you do get a kind of intimacy with social networking , even with email			2
people say things in email and tweets that they might be embarrassed about and regret			0
but deep connections and a sense of trust can only come from face - to - face			1
it can only come from repeated encounters			0
so , for example , we are holding a supper club in @entity37 where 15 of our club members gather around for what we call a mid-week dinner party			0
the whole point of the mid-week dinner party is that in a relaxed informal environment , no agenda , interesting ideas happen			0
it 's not just about saying , " can you be useful ? " it is about " are you saying something interesting to me that i am learning from ? " what we want now is a blended environment , in which all forms of communication join up more meaningfully			2
so the person who feels very confident on @entity208 and @entity209 feels equally confident discussing an idea or a book in real time , opposite somebody			0
@entity77 : what does this growing culture of networking mean for the future ? @entity128 : it is arguably a new industry			2
i mean , there are not as many books written about networking and business theories as there are about leadership or communication or strategy			0
networking has the elements of all three , but it is about human knowledge networks , rather than technological networks			0
so there is an emerging academic discipline as well .			1

@entity31 is professor of networking at the @entity30 's @entity35
she argues that networking distinguishes highly skilled workers from average ones .
' deep connections ' require face - to - face meetings , she says
@entity31 says networking is an emerging academic discipline
