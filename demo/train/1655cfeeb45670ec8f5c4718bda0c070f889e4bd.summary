i had to see the movie " @entity3			1
" not because of the @entity5 buzz but because of the vicious anti-muslim and @entity8 comments posted by some on social media after seeing the film			2
as @entity13 , the president of the @entity14 , noted , there have been hundreds of violent messages on @entity16 and @entity17 directed against @entity18 and @entity19 made by people who had seen " @entity3			1
" for example , tweets such as , " great f * @ # # @ * movie and now i really want to kill some f * @ # # @ * ragheads , " " @entity33 to see a movie where the @entity18 are portrayed for who they really are - vermin scum intent on destroying us " and " @entity3 made me ... hate @entity34 more			1
" being of @entity18 heritage and @entity19 , i had to know : did the film really portray @entity18 and @entity19 in way that would naturally draw these types of hateful comments ? was the film a jingoistic jubilee , like a " @entity42 " for a new generation , but where the @entity19 / @entity18 are now the " evil empire " instead of the @entity45 ? what did i find ? the film was not any of those things			2
" @entity3 " is the most powerful anti-war film i have ever seen			1
true , the film is based on the autobiography of @entity52 , the decorated @entity53 sniper who recorded the most " kills " in @entity56 military history			2
that fact is likely the reason some on the right have championed the film as a pro-war anthem			1
but " @entity3 " is becoming as misunderstood as @entity63 's classic song , " born in the @entity56 " @entity64 from @entity65 on have played that song at their campaign events believing it to be a pro-america celebratory anthem			1
it 's anything but that			2
the lyrics of " born in the @entity56 " poignantly criticize the @entity73 and the way our country treated its veterans after their return to the states			0
many did n't listen to the words and so missed @entity63 's point			2
it 's like this with " @entity3			1
" the film does more than portray the horrors of war			1
that we have seen before			0
instead , it focuses on the horrors that come after : the post-war suffering when those who have served come home			0
director @entity94 gives us a parade of veterans who have been wounded in some fashion : lost legs , lost arms , lost hands , lost souls			1
even veterans who appear intact at first glance , turn out to be far from it			0
for example , one scene features a veteran in an auto repair garage back in the @entity56			0
he recognizes @entity52 and after speaking to him for a minute , raises his pant leg to show he is missing a leg			0
it 's not surprising @entity94 would make an anti-war movie			1
the usually tight - lipped @entity94 recently commented , " contrary to public opinion , i abhor violence			2
" and @entity94 has not only publicly opposed to the @entity116 war , he even questioned waging the war in @entity118			1
as to my original reason for seeing the film , to learn whether it incites hatred of @entity19 and @entity18 ? well , i do n't think you are going to like our communities more after seeing the film			2
but i 'm fairly confident that those who made hateful comments about @entity18 and @entity19 hated us before they stepped into the movie theater			2
the film just gave them an excuse to voice their bigotry			0
it 's important to note : @entity52 was not killed by an @entity116 , but according to police , by a @entity56 veteran who allegedly had ptsd			0
it happened long after he 'd returned from the battlefield			0
if people are angry with that or about the fate of the other @entity56 who suffered in the war , they should focus should not on @entity56 @entity19 but on those who led our country into a war based on questionable reasons			0
that does n't mean i do n't wish @entity94 made a more balanced film that would let audiences see the brutality and suffering of both sides in the conflict			1
there is n't any reference , for example , to the horrors of @entity162 prison where @entity56 soldiers infamously tortured @entity116			0
nor was there any reference to the 2006 massacre in @entity167 , @entity116 , which happened during the period @entity52 was in @entity116			0
that 's when @entity56 @entity169 went on a killing spree and slaughtered 24 unarmed @entity116 including women , children and an elderly man in a wheel chair			0
and @entity94 's depiction of the @entity116 was almost comically without nuance			1
forget character development ; the @entity116 version of @entity52 , for example -- a sniper known as " @entity181 " -- barely registered as one - dimensional			0
he did n't even speak ; he was simply depicted as a silent killing machine			0
was @entity94 's use of an almost video game - like violence when it came to killing @entity116 calculated to dehumanize the @entity116 people ? i do n't think so			1
his focus was not on whom we were fighting , but the unbearably high price @entity56 pay for waging war regardless of its target			0
the film is a cautionary tale for @entity56 about why we must avoid war			2
it is not a celebration of waging it			0
while " @entity3 " did garner an @entity5 nomination for best picture , @entity94 was not nominated for best director			1
but @entity94 deserves a special award -- for making a powerful anti-war film that the right would cheer .			1

@entity208 : " @entity3 , " *touted* by right as pro-war movie , has inflamed some @entity211 *rhetoric*
he says it 's really a powerful anti-war film . director @entity94 shows the damage wrought by *senseless* war
